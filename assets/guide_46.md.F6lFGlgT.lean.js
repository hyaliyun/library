It was formed in January 1893 when it purchased all the assets of the bankrupted Cape Central Railway (CCR) who had constructed a railway from Worcester via Robertson to Roodewal. In 1894, the NCCR began work to extend the railway to Swellendam. From there it continued via Heidelberg to Riversdale, which was reached on 3 December 1903. Voorbaai, outside Mossel Bay, was reached in 1906. When the Cape Government Railways linked up with the NCCR at Mossel Bay on 23 September 1907, the NCCR undertook to operate the section to George. Unlike many other privately owned railways in South Africa, the NCCR prospered and was well and efficiently run. Prior to 1917 dividends were small, but from 1917 to 1925 dividends of 4¬Ω% were declared each year. The NCCR was the last component railway to be added to the South African Railways (SAR) when it was liquidated and amalgamated in May 1925. All the NCCR locomotives which came onto the SAR roster continued to give good service for many years. Manufacturer Increasing traffic and heavier loads led to the decision by the NCCR in 1922 to place an order with Beyer, Peacock and Company for two Garratt Double Prairie type locomotives. The locomotives were built to the design of the Class GB of the SAR and were also superheated, with Belpaire fireboxes, plate frames, piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear, but they were heavier and had larger cylinders. They were delivered in 1923 and were initially numbered 12 and 13, but were later renumbered G1 and G2. The Garratts were the last new locomotives to be acquired by the company. Service =New Cape Central Railway= In service on the NCCR, each Garratt could replace two of the railway‚Äôs older Class 7 locomotives, one Garratt being able to do the work of altogether worth of tender locomotives while saving of coal and one crew's wages in the process. The Garratts eliminated the need to double-head passenger trains which often consisted of eight bogie carriages. =South African Railways= When the NCCR was amalgamated into the SAR in 1925, the two Garratt locomotives were renumbered 2340 and 2341 on the SAR roster and designated Class GK. The locomotives were initially transferred to Cape Town and later joined the Class GD Garratts on the Overberg branch line to Caledon for a brief period. Since they were much lighter than the Class GD, they were less useful as traffic engines. They were then sent to Natal where they remained in service on the Donnybrook to Underberg branch until they were withdrawn from service by 1957.Soul of A Railway, System 1, Part 7: The Caledon train.

Its activities include educational programmes, local networking around the world, and participation in the public debate on matters relevant its members. The association was also involved in the establishment of the Fredensborg Houses north of Copenhagen which offer lucrative housing to Danes who return home after long periods abroad. History Danes Worldwide was founded as Dansk Samvirke in 1919 as an initiative to strengthen the ties between Denmark and Danish emigrants around the world at a time when emigration to the United States and South America was at its height. During World War II membership increased drastically, peaking in 1947 to 10,000 members. The war made contact to Danes abroad very difficult and many Danish expats, especially in the Far East, lost their livelihood. Dansk Samvirke concentrated its efforts on helping those returning to Denmark. Chairman J√∏rgen Saxild launched an almost ten-year aid programme ranging from financial support to a social service for those who lost everything. After the war, in 1949, the association acquired its own building, a property in the diplomatic quarter of the √òsterbro district of Copenhagen, which served both as an office and a meeting place for Danes who returned home. In 1998, Dansk Samvirke changed its name to Danes Worldwide and acquired a new logo, a \\"Danish globe\\" designed by Piet Hein. Educational programmes =Danish Summer School= Danes Worldwide arranges an annual three-week Danish Summer School which gives Danish children abroad the opportunity to learn Danish and experience Danish culture. It was introduced in 1981. =Online Language Lessons= Since 1990, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Danes Worldwide has been running a programme for distance learning for children aged 6‚Äì17 to supplement their local schooling. It collaborates with the Danish Summer School, giving pupils following the distance learning courses the opportunity to take the Danish School Leaving Examination. Kronborg Meeting Up until 2012, the association arranged an annual meet-up for Danes living abroad at Kronborg Castle in Helsing√∏r. The first meeting took place in 1935. Although Kronborg is now a thing of the past, the association continues to arrange various events and meet-ups. Most recently in Politikens Hus on September 1, 2015, in celebration of dual citizenship. Magazine The association publishes the members' magazine Danes with information from Denmark as well as from the many small Danish communities around the world. The magazine was first published as \\"Danmarksposten\\" in 1920. It was re-launched in 2010 under the current name. Fredensborg Houses Fredensborg Houses Danes Worldwide was also involved in the establishment of the Fredensborg Houses, now a self-owning institution, in Fredensborg north of Copenhagen, which provide cheap and attractive housing on a rental basis for Danes who return home after long periods abroad. Located next to Fredensborg Golf Course and Fredensborg Palace, the housing complex was built from 1960 to 1963 to the design of J√∏rn Utzon, architect of Sydney Opera House. The attached houses come in two sizes, 73 and 130 square metres, and have low rental rates. World Dane of the Year Award Danes Worldwide establishes the World Dane of the Year Award in 2008. Handed out at the annual Kronborg Meeting, it honours a Dane who has made a special contribution to putting Denmark on the world map. Recipients have been: * 2008: Michael Laudrup, footballer * 2009: Bent Fabric, pianist and composer * 2010: Lene Hau, physicist Lobbying For many years, Danes Worldwide advocated in the Danish parliament for the right to dual citizenship for Danish citizens abroad. This goal was realized in 2015, when a recently passed law took effect, allowing Danes to acquire other citizenships without losing their Danish citizenship.

Her body was found five days later. Disappearance On September 10, 1988, seven-year-old Jaclyn was taken from her home in Midlothian, Illinois at some point during the night. The next morning, her mother Cynthia Dowaliby reported her as a missing child, possibly an abduction, and claimed that she \\"prayed for her return\\". Police reportedly found a broken window, but it may have been a phony entry area as her adoptive father David Dowaliby later recalled the back door was left open. Search parties were organized, but for five days Jaclyn was nowhere to be found. Death and legacy On September 14, 1988, Dowaliby's body was found abandoned at a dump site six miles away from her home. Even though an autopsy couldn't reveal when she had been killed, the police suspected that Cynthia and David were involved in the crime. In 1990 they were put on trial for her murder. Cynthia was acquitted but David was convicted on eyewitness testimony which placed him at the scene where her body was found. In October 1991, an appellate court overturned his conviction, ruling that there was no more evidence against him than there had been against Cynthia. On November 13, 1991, David Dowaliby was released from prison. Nobody else has been arrested or convicted for her murder. In popular culture The Dowaliby case was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries on November 18, 1992. It featured interviews with the Dowalibys, along with the investigators and defense attorneys involved in the case. In 1996, a television film was released, entitled Gone in the Night. It was based on Dowaliby's disappearance and murder, and starred Kevin Dillon and Shannen Doherty as David and Cynthia.

An √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint-Cloud alumnus, he is Chair of Contemporary Philosophy in the Sorbonne.  Philosophy  A phenomenologist, his works have primarily focused on the philosophies of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau- Ponty. More recently, his readings of Czech philosopher Jan Patoƒçka have influenced him into conceiving a phenomenology of life and accordingly, a cosmology in which man's place is to be thought anew. In 1999, Renaud Barbaras begins to build his own philosophy as he is confronted with the apories of the philosophy of the late Merleau-Ponty, the philosopher he worked on for his PhD. Subtitled \\"an introduction to a phenomenology of perception\\" in homage to the author of Visible and invisible, Barbaras' Desire and distance addresses the consequences of the Abschattungslehre neither Husserl nor Merleau-Ponty managed to be coherent with: his idea is to be faithful to the principle according to which the fact that we only perceive one side of the things around us doesn't mean we don't perceive them as themselves.Desire and distance, Introduction: The problem of perception This is what he calls not submitting perception to the law of object (or objectivity): the mistake he spots is the prejudice we have to think our way of perceiving as imperfect in comparison to the supposed plenitude of the things themselves.Desire and distance, Chapter 2: Critique of transcendantal phenomenology But to be consequent would be to acknowledge the fact that nothing can appear if not to a subject. This doesn't mean the subject is constituting the object, but merely that he is a part of the process of manifestation.Desire and distance, Chapter 3: The three moments of manifestation To be a part of and not to be constituting: this requires a new definition of subjectivity, which Barbaras tries to give through the conception of a subject based on the natural movement and what he calls desire:Desire and distance, Chapter 5: Desire as essence of subjectivity > \\"We began our inquiry on the being of the intramondaneous subject with the > relation, phenomenologically attested, between perception and movement. Now, > this relation no longer represents any difficulty. It is plainly justified > by the fact desire consists in experiencing its own limits. Indeed, since > perception is only possible through the limitation of a totality, every > perception essentially calls for its overtaking by a movement. Perceiving, > in the end, is always passing to something else. And this doesn't only mean > that a perception may give way to another perception, but that perception > consists in giving way to something else because, since perception is > desire, a reality is only to be grasped as something essentially missing.\\"Le > d√©sir et la distance (1999), Vrin, p. 151.

Education and inspiration Hungarian by descent, Agardy was born in the United States after her parents and sister fled Hungary. She had the good fortune of being selected to participate in a high school expedition to the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn about field biology, and there cemented her desire to focus on the sea and the challenges to preserving its wonders. After studying at Wellesley and Dartmouth Colleges in New England (USA), she returned to the Virgin Islands to lead an Endangered Species Management Program in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Years later she returned to graduate school at the University of Rhode Island (URI), where she simultaneously worked towards her Master of Marine Affairs (specializing in fisheries management) and her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences (sea turtle population dynamics and genetics). While at URI she joined the nascent Coastal Resources Center, exporting US experience in coastal planning to developing countries. Agardy then went on to do a post-doc at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and was a Marine Policy Fellow there for several years. It was while at WHOI that she began working with the multilateral institutions that would shape her interests and work in years to come: the Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme of UNESCO and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The love of the sea that her husband Josh Spring and children Alex, Sophie, and Christopher all share is a continuing source of inspiration. Environmental NGO work In 1990, Agardy moved to Washington to work as Senior Scientist for World Wildlife Fund (WWF). At the time there was no formal marine program, but country programs were encouraged to do more in the marine conservation realm, and Agardy assisted in priority-setting, project design, and project execution, working in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Central America, and Europe. As much of this work centered on marine protected areas, she used the wealth of knowledge acquired in her experiences to write the acclaimed book ‚ÄúMarine Protected Areas and Ocean Conservation‚Äù.Agardy, T.S. Marine Protected Areas and Ocean Conservation. RE Landes Company, Academic Press, Austin Texas (1997) During this time, Agardy also worked closely with IUCN field and headquarters programs, and chaired the Marine Advisory Group that guided the Union‚Äôs marine conversation activities over multiple triennia. She later joined Conservation International to launch CI‚Äôs Global Marine Program, and shortly thereafter founded Sound Seas, looking for ways to interface between the scientific community, the international policy arena, and the NGO and multilateral institutions relying on scientific information and policy frameworks in order to achieve effective marine conservation. Assessment and evaluation Sound Seas began with small teams addressing the needs of philanthropic foundations to conduct evaluations and undertake strategic planning. Through Sound Seas Agardy conducted a strategic evaluation of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation‚Äôs Population, Consumption, and Environment Program, and assisted the Oak Foundation in its early efforts to support marine protected area initiatives worldwide. Agardy worked with colleagues to design the Coral Reef Targeted Research Project of the World Bank, and prepared a feasibility study for the institutional arrangement that supported it. Sound Seas explored the feasibility of establishing a research station on Palmyra Atoll for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and conducted evaluations for the United Nations Development Programme in the Black Sea region, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for its support of WWF climate change work in Cameroon, Fiji, and Tanzania, and International Financial Corporation (IFC) in its support of TNC work in Komodo, Indonesia. She is continuing to work with UNEP's Mediterranean Action Programme, coordinating an initial assessment of the Mediterranean Sea to promote the Ecosystem Approach in the region. This builds on the work she has done in marine protected areas, targeted marine research, and identification of ecologically important areas, in Italian waters and in the Mediterranean as a whole. In 2001, shortly after founding Sound Seas, Agardy began brainstorming with colleagues from the World Resources Institute about how to recognize the value of natural ecosystems for humanity. This led to her involvement with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), which in 2005 published the first global evaluation of the status of ecosystems in relation to human well-being. Agardy headed the coastal portion of this comprehensive assessment, and was co-author of the summary document ‚ÄúEcosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis\\".Duraiappah, A.K., S.

Current State and Trends Assessment. Chapter 19. Coastal Systems (2005) www.maweb.org Coastal and marine management and training Building on experiences gained in promoting marine protected areas, policies aimed at marine biodiversity conservation, and integrated coastal and marine planning, Agardy published several books that continue to provide guidance for marine managers today. A co-authored publication entitled ‚ÄúBiodiversity in the Seas‚ÄùDeFontaubert, A.C., Downes, D.R., and Agardy, T.S. Biodiversity in the Seas: Implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity in Marine and Coastal Habitats. IUCN, Gland Switzerland and Cambridge UK (1996) has been credited as spurring many marine conservation activities that followed the adoption of the Jakarta Mandate of the Convention on Biological Diversity, focusing world attention on the value and status of life in the seas. Her innumerable publications on marine protected area (MPA) and MPA network design, on science and information needs in planning, and on integrated or ecosystem-based marine management have helped to add rigor to the field of marine conservation. Her book ‚ÄúOcean Zoning: Making Marine Management More Effective\\"Agardy, T. Ocean Zoning: Making Marine Management More Effective. Earthscan, London (2010) explores the tool of zoning in Marine Spatial Planning and integrated management more generally. Working through the Center for Biodiversity at the American Museum of Natural History, Sound Seas created several teaching modules on marine conservation biology, international treaties, and marine protected areas.

UNEP Nairobi (2011) and this book serves as the basis for training and capacity building in various regions around the world, including in the Mediterranean Sea (through the Barcelona Convention and its Mediterranean Action Programme) and the Red Sea region (PERSGA). Marine ecosystem services and market Recognizing the inadequate resource base that exists for doing marine management effectively around the world, Agardy joined Forest Trends in 2006 to explore innovative financing for marine conservation. The focus of the MARES (Marine Ecosystem Services) Program that she launched is on assessing the value of coastal and marine habitats for the myriad ecosystem services they provide, and identifying opportunities for Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), offsets, or other market-like mechanisms to generate revenues that support conservation (and, very often, local communities that provide stewardship).Agardy, T., W.

Having begun to specialise in seascapes under the influence of his contemporaries Pompeo Mariani and Giorgio Belloni in 1890, he later adopted the anti-naturalistic approach characteristic of the turn of the century, possibly as a result of his friendship with the Symbolist poet Gian Pietro Lucini. In addition to his large output of paintings, he also worked as an illustrator and commercial artist.

It was built in 1449 by Br√°s Afonso Correia, a worker in the court of King Dom Manuel I and the Comptroller of Lisbon. It was constructed over Roman and Moorish ruins around the ancient Alc√°√ßova and Moorish walls, which were around 1,500 years old at the time. Riu de Figueiredo turned it into a manor house by acquiring and transforming land, old houses, a yard, and a stall. At this time, the complex included the walls, a door called D. Fradique, three towers, a turret, and two towers (both dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries). Aside from the Roman and Moorish foundations, the oldest parts of the palace include a medieval keep and fortifications, which were constructed with Roman and Moorish influences. In 1503, after leading the first European expedition to reach Brazil, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral built the first part of the present palace in 1503. As Pal√°cio's neighborhood and the primitive nucleus of Lisbon, Almafa, became the stage for major national events, Pal√°cio Belmonte assumed an important role as well. For instance, Vasco da Gama was received there after his successful return from India. The palace was also where Gil Vicente presented his first play, and the famous Portuguese historian Fern√£o Lopes wrote his famous chronicles. In 1640, the year when the palace underwent its most significant restoration, the building was expanded by adding what is now known as the Terrace Suites and the five facades in the classical style. These changes constitute the most of what we see of the palace today. Between 1720 and 1730, two great masters of Portuguese tiles, Manuel Santos and Valentim de Almeida, contributed a unique collection of 59 panels. The panels contained more than 30,000 tiles, depicting episodes of Christianity and scenes from the Portuguese court of that time. On the main door, there are the weapons of Figueiredo, with five fig leaves that accompany the words Pro Deo Pro Patria PN AM. The palace also features notable architectural features such as vaulted ceilings, arched doorways, and painted frescoes, among others. The pal√°cio's collection of tiles, peculiar eighteenth-century fireplace, and its garden with a stunning view over Alfama, S√£o Vicente de Fora, and the Tagus river, earned Belmonte recognition as a National Heritage site. Today, it has been transformed into a luxury hotel, consisted of 10 suites. Each suite is named after a major figure of Portuguese history: Fern√£o Magalh√£es, Egas Moniz, Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, Gil Vicente, and Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o, among others. Frederic Coustouls purchased and restored the pal√°cio in 1994 with the assistance of the city of Lisbon and the European Union. The restoration focused on the creation of spaces and rooms that feature distinctive character with an emphasis on intimacy. In addition, the builders also integrated elements of sustainable design, using heavy insulation, large windows, and natural ventilation. German director Wim Wenders chose the Palace to shoot his film Lisbon Story. Marcello Mastroianni also used the Palace, for the film Sostiene Pereira.

Chierici continued his studies at the academies of Modena and Florence before completing his training in Bologna under the guidance of Giulio Cesare Ferrari. His early work was in Italy influenced by the Neo-classicism of his uncle, the artist Alfonso Chierici, and of Adeodato Malatesta, but subsequently by the innovations of the Macchiaioli painters. It was in the late 1860s that he took up anecdotal genre painting with domestic interiors, which came to be his field of specialisation. While the artist‚Äôs participation in the Fine Arts Expositions at the Brera Academy of 1869 marked the beginning of his success with critics and collectors, his work subsequently declined into mechanical repetition of the same subjects. He was the director of the Workers‚Äô School of Drawing in Reggio Emilia from 1882 to 1907 and the city‚Äôs first Socialist mayor from 1900 to 1902. In the Alfred O.

After signing with the Baltimore Orioles, he was undefeated in seven decisions with a 1.96 earned run average for the 1963 Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class A Northern League. Drafted from the Orioles by the Cincinnati Reds following that season, Secrist spent five more years in the Reds' farm system. In his last, in 1968, he won 11 games and lost two for the Indianapolis Indians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Following that campaign, he was dealt with catcher Don Pavletich to the White Sox for pitcher Jack Fisher. Secrist then spent much of the 1969 season with the MLB White Sox, appearing in 19 games, making his debut during the home opener of the expansion Seattle Pilots at Sick's Stadium in his native city. He recorded his only MLB decision, a loss, on July 16 against the Minnesota Twins. Secrist pitched four innings that day and allowed only two runs, but he gave up the game-winning tally on a home run by Minnesota's Rich Reese. In 1970, he appeared in nine more games for the ChiSox during April, May and June before returning to the minor leagues. In 28 games and 54‚Öî innings pitched at a Major Leaguer, Secrist allowed 54 hits, nine home runs, and 26 bases on balls with 32 strikeouts.

Tibet =Nepali community in Lhasa= History Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa in 1955. The first Nepalis to arrive in Tibet were Newar merchants. In the early Malla period (1100-1480), evidence of Newar expansion emerges. Trade routes to Tibet via Humla, Mustang, Kyirong, Khasa and Olangchung Gola channeled north-south relations.\\"Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants By Professor Todd T. Lewis\\", College of the Holy Cross, USA Following the Shah conquest of the Newars, Prithvi Narayan Shah cut off the flow of trade through Kathmandu, depriving the Malla kings of revenue and undermining the Newar traders' support of their own. After the British Younghusband Expedition opened up the shorter trade route to Tibet through Kalimpong, by 1908 Newar traders had lost their advantaged position in the Lhasa trade. To trade effectively in Tibet, Newar families sent their brothers or sons to the major cities of Lhasa, Shigatse and Gyantse to live for years at a time. Overtime, these men learned to speak Tibetan, took part in the cultural life centered on Buddhism, and many married Tibetan women. In 1943, Nepalese traders based in Lhasa formed the Nepalese Chamber of Commerce in order to promote trade and coordinated among its members to set uniform prices for their merchandise besides lobbying with the government for business- friendly policy. Present The ethnically Nepalese community of Lhasa comprises two prominent groups, Tibetan families who are descendants of Nepalese traders and hotel or restaurant workers from Nepal who come on short- term work visas.\\"Nepalis on the plateau \\", Nepali Times, 5 September 2003 ‚Äì 11 September 2003 . The latter, numbering under 100 at least according to consular statistics, are sought after by Lhasa hoteliers for their experience of cooking non-Asian food. Some of Lhasa's most popular hotels are even owned by mixed Nepali-Tibetan families, known locally as kazara, meaning 'mixed race' in Tibetan. Some of these families have been living in Tibet for more than 300 years, and now speak Chinese alongside Tibetan, Newari and Nepali. While many children attend local Chinese schools, Nepali families may also opt to send their kids to the Gorkha Primary School of Lhasa, established 65 years ago, which has two Nepali teachers and is paid for by the government of Nepal. = Kyirong = The Nepalese Gurkhas who live in Gyirong Town are classified as Daman people (Tamang). = Zhangmu = Some Newari traders settle in Zhangmu, a border town in Nyalam County. Hong Kong Nepalis form roughly 0.2% of the total population of Hong Kong. Nepalese people began to come to Hong Kong in the 1970s, as part of the British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas. They continued in this employment until 1997. Their primary duties were to deter illegal immigrants and protect local residents. Most of them lived in Whitfield Barracks and Shek Kong Barracks. After 30 June 1997, the British Government withdrew from Hong Kong and the Gurkha brigade disbanded. These Gurkhas and their children had the right to take up residence in Hong Kong.Sautman, Barry.

He was known for writing poems filled with puns (xiehouyu) that satirized the political scene that impressed Emperor Zhaozong, leading to his brief term as chancellor despite his own misgivings.  Background  Little is known about Zheng Qi's background, as his family was not included in the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang.New Book of Tang, vol. 75 . After he passed the imperial examinations, he initially served as an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤) then as Dianzhong Shi Yushi (ÊÆø‰∏≠‰æçÂæ°Âè≤). He then served as a low-level official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), initially as Cangbu Yuanwailang (ÂÄâÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé) then as Hubu Yuanwailang (Êà∂ÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé). He then served as a supervisory official at the ministry of census as Jinbu Langzhong (ÈáëÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), then at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu) as Xingbu Langzhong (ÂàëÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), then at the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) as Yousi Langzhong (Âè≥Âè∏ÈÉé‰∏≠).Old Book of Tang, vol. 179. Although these posts carried prestige as imperial official posts, they lacked sufficient salary, and Zheng, because his family was poor, sought an assignment out of the capital Chang'an, and thereafter was made the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui). As the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao advanced north in 880,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Zheng wrote him a declaration ordering him not to invade Lu Prefecture ‚Äî a declaration that amused Huang who thereafter skipped past Lu Prefecture. When Zheng later left the post as prefect, he had accumulated some savings, but he left in the care of the prefectural treasury, which was not plundered even later when other agrarian rebels overran Lu Prefecture. Yet later, when Yang Xingmi served as the prefect, he had messengers deliver the money to Zheng. Zheng was good at writing poetry, and particularly became known for writing poetry that did not strictly comply with metric requirements and which focused on satirizing contemporary events. The format became known as the \\"Xiehou style of the Fifth Zheng.\\" (The fact that he referred to himself and was referred to others as the Fifth Zheng probably indicated that he was ranked fifth among his brothers.) When the imperial official Wang Hui served as the chief imperial censor,Wang Hui apparently only served very briefly as chief imperial censor, in 888 (during the time that Emperor Xizong was in transit from Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) back to Chang'an), as Wang's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was commissioned at Fengxiang but resigned the post after Emperor Xizong's return to Chang'an, so this event would have been in 888. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 178 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. he recommended Zheng to serve as Bingbu Langzhong (ÂÖµÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu), and also oversee the administration of the office of the censors (Âæ°Âè≤Ëá∫, Yushi Tai). He later served as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). When Emperor Xizong was set to commission Du Honghui (ÊùúÂºòÂæΩ), the younger brother of the chancellor Du Rangneng, as a Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫, mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)), Zheng, in his duty of reviewing edicts, sealed and returned the edict to the emperor, arguing that it was inappropriate for one brother to oversee another (the chancellors had overall supervisory authority over the legislative bureau). Emperor Xizong took no action on Zheng's objection, so Zheng claimed an illness and resigned his post. Soon thereafter, Zheng was recalled to the imperial government to serve as Zuo Sanqi Changshi (Â∑¶Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç), a high-level advisory official at the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). It was said that he submitted many suggestions whenever he saw a problem with imperial governance. Not many of his suggestions were accepted, but they became publicly known at the capital. The ruling officials disliked this phenomenon and made him the principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁ•≠ÈÖí, Guozi Jijiu). When this assignment was announced, the public believed that Zheng was moved because he was being honest. The ruling officials became fearful of the consequences and made him Zuo Sanqi Changshi again.  Chancellorship and after chancellorship  Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong eventually became aware of Zheng Qi's poems, as eunuchs recited them in their spare time. Emperor Zhaozong saw their biting satire and believed that they showed hidden talent. In 894, he issued an edict making Zheng the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang) and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. When Zheng's assistants reported this to Zheng to congratulate him, Zheng himself did not take it seriously and stated, \\"Gentlemen, you must have erred. Even if no one else under heaven knew how to read, the Fifth Zheng cannot be a chancellor.\\" When the assistants insisted that this was the will of the emperor, he stated, \\"If this is true, people will laugh to death.\\" When the edict announcing his chancellorship arrived the next day, along with congratulating guests, Zheng was confounded, stating to himself, \\"If the Fifth Zheng, the xiehou writer, becomes chancellor, what does this say about the current state of governance?\\" He submitted several petitions declining the commission, but the emperor took no heed of them, so he felt compelled to report to his post as a chancellor. It was said that after Zheng became a chancellor, he took his responsibilities seriously and was no longer spending his time in humorous speech. However, he still felt that he was not a chancellor who met the expectation of the people. After serving as a chancellor for three months, he resigned and was allowed to retire as an advisor to the Crown Prince. He died in 899.

Life  Elizabeth was the youngest of five daughters of Landgrave William I of Hesse (1466‚Äì1515) from his marriage to Anna of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1460‚Äì1520), daughter of Duke William of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. Elizabeth was raised as a Protestant. In 1518, she was kidnapped by just Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, who had just come of age, to prevent a marriage which her mother Anna had planned, but which Elisabeth herself was opposed to.Verein f√ºr Hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde: Zeitschrift: Beiheft, vol. 38, G. Fischer., 1931, p. 29 She married on 10 September 1525 in Kassel, Count Palatine and Duke Louis II of Zweibr√ºcken (1502‚Äì1532). This marriage of a princess inclined to the Reformation with a close relative of Philip the Magnanimous, the largest promoter of the Reformation, gave a considerable boost to the Reformation in the Duchy of Zweibr√ºcken. The marriage had been planned for the spring of 1525, but the German Peasants' War interfered. Elizabeth was regarded as extremely pious, affable and benevolent. She used her considerable inheritance to compensate the victims of the peasant uprising in the Duchy. After her husband's early death, Emperor Ferdinand I appointed Elisabeth and Count Palatine Rupert of Veldenz as joint regents for her young son. On 9 January 1541, Elisabeth married her second husband, Count Palatine George of Simmern (1518‚Äì1569). She made a significant contribution when she and George finally managed to enforce the reformation in Simmern.Entwurf einer Kirchen und Religionsgeschichte des Herzogthums Zweibr√ºcken, 1782, p. 17, Online  Issue  From her first marriage to Louis II of Zweibr√ºcken, she had two children: * Wolfgang (1526‚Äì1569), Count Palatine of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, married in 1545 Anna of Hesse (1529‚Äì1591) * Christine (1528‚Äì1534) From her second marriage to George of Simmern-Sponheim, she had a son: * John (1541‚Äì1562)  References  * J.

It is an amphibious aircraft capable of alighting on land, water or snow without adaptation. It has a high-aspect-ratio electrically-folding wing, with trailing edge extensions rather than flaps, and a rear-mounted tractor configuration engine. Design and development The LISA Akoya (Akoya is a species of pearl oyster) is an innovative light aircraft designed to operate from land, water or snow without adaptation and incorporating a wing of variable area. Some other features are also unusual: it has a wing which folds for transportation by horizontal rotation through almost 90¬∞ and a single engine mounted high on the fin in tractor configuration. It is built entirely from carbon-fiber- reinforced polymer composites. The cantilever wings of the Akoya have an aspect ratio of about 18:1, very high for a powered aircraft. They have constant chord apart from the angled tips. Instead of conventional hinged flaps, the inner of the trailing edge can be extended rearwards, exposing new fabric surface stored within the wing in roller blind fashion. Fully extended for landing and half extended for take-off, these surfaces provide a large increase in wing area. Conventional ailerons are fitted outboard. High mounted, the wings attach at a rotatable fairing on the highest point of the fuselage, allowing the rotation for storage. The fin and rudder together form a swept, short and parallel chord surface which carries at its top both the tailplane in T-tail configuration and the engine. The tailplane, like the wing, is of high aspect ratio and has full span elevators. The engine is a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912 ULS flat four, driving a three bladed tractor propeller. The Akoya's fuselage is pointed at the nose and almost circular at its greatest diameter. In elevation it has a curved underside and, above, the large one piece canopy over the side-by-side, dual control cabin forms an unbroken line with the fuselage. There is an electrically operated retractable undercarriage of the taildragger variety, with the main gear legs rotating backward and inwards into the fuselage, and the tailwheel arm rotating forward. All wheels have hydraulic brakes. Operation from water, without a planing bottom or floats, is performed undercarriage up on the round fuselage underside with the aid of a pair of fixed hydrofoils, called shark-fins, sharply tapered planes set at about 50¬∞ to the vertical just outboard of the mainwheels. Small tip floats are an option for better lateral stability on water. The Akoya, it is claimed by the manufacturer, can also land on snow, though skis are an option. A full-size mock-up appeared at the Friedrichshafen Aero '07 show in April 2007, and the prototype flew in August 2007 at Chambery. By May 2009 F-WURE had flown 150 hours and 50 orders placed. Production was initially expected by mid-2011. In March 2012 the company was pursuing light-sport aircraft approval of the design to facilitate sales in the United States. In July 2012 the prototype had flown its first passenger and has been exhibited at AirVenture 2012. LSA approval and the start of production was still pending. Also in July 2012, the company was placed in receivership for financial restructuring after existing investors were not forthcoming with additional funds. By February 2013 a 75% controlling interest in the company had been purchased by the Heima Mining Company of China for US$20 million. The Heima Mining Company will name its own chairman of LISA and plans to open two new production lines in France. The Chinese investment permitted finalizing the Akoya's design for production. In late 2014 the aircraft was priced \\"all inclusive\\" at 300,000 Euros. In July 2015 information about the aircraft was shown at AirVenture, and the price was indicated as US$330,000, and the company claimed about 100 orders. In March 2017 it was announced that an updated second-prototype would fly in April 2017, it included a new retractable landing gear that would enable the aircraft to operate on water, land and snow. The second prototype, Pre-Series 1, first flew in August 2017 and features revised fuselage fins, that are horizontal, instead of canted downwards. This change enabled shortening the main landing gear legs to improve cockpit visibility when taxiing.

The successful snack food was marketed as an alternative to the more traditional potato chips. Doritos are now Frito-Lay's second best-selling item, bested only by Lay's Potato Chips. An estimated five billion dollars in Doritos are sold every year worldwide. Biography =Early life= West was born on September 8, 1914, in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents, James and Jessie West, were immigrants from Scotland. West and his brother were raised at a Masonic home because his mother was too impoverished to care for them. He received a bachelor's degree in business from Franklin College in Indiana in 1936. West was also a member of Kappa Delta Rho during his time at FC. West then served in the United States Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II as a gunnery officer. =Career= He began his career at Standard Brands, where he worked as a traveling sales representative. West then switched careers to advertising, based in New York City. His early portfolio included the Jell-O ad campaign. Arch West joined the staff of the Frito Company, now called Frito-Lay, in 1960. (Pepsi acquired Frito-Lay in 1965.) West is widely credited for the invention and development of one of the company's signature products, Doritos. According to West's daughter, Jana Hacker, West first envisioned the idea of Doritos in the early 1960s while working as Frito's vice president of marketing. West was vacationing with his family in San Diego, California, in 1961, when he noticed customers at a small, roadside restaurant eating corn chips that had been deep fried. West reportedly enjoyed the taste of this type of snack food. Almost simultaneously, Frito merged with the H.W. Lay Company in 1961. West pitched the idea for Doritos soon after. His colleagues at Frito-Lay were initially not enthusiastic about his idea for a snack food made from tortilla chips. However, West conducted market research and development which revealed a potential market for his proposed snack. The company produced the first Doritos chips in 1964. West developed the snack as a triangle-shaped, crispy tortilla chip flavored with chilli and cheese. The shape and signature orange color of the chips were inspired by West‚Äôs fraternity at Franklin, Kappa Delta Rho. The first flavors of Doritos were corn and taco and an early television commercial called Doritos \\"a swinging, Latin sort of snack.\\" Author Andrew F. Smith noted West's contributions to Doritos in his 2006 book, Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food. West also had a hand in the marketing of Pace salsas and picante sauces. He was a longtime friend of Dave Pace, the founder of Pace Foods. West suggested that Pace's products be displayed on the same grocery aisle as the chips, rather than with ketchup. The move quickly increased sales of Pace products. West retired from his position as vice president of marketing at Frito-Lay in 1971. =Later life= West was injured in a car accident while volunteering for disaster relief in Amarillo, Texas, circa 1990, but recovered from his injuries. His car was hit by a tanker truck in the accident. Arch West died from peritonitis and complications from vascular surgery at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas on September 20, 2011, at the age of 97. He and his wife, Charlotte F. Thomson (died 2010), had four children.

The FMNP and SFMNP represent attempts at increasing the accessibility and consumption of healthy, fresh foods among low-income populations through a comprehensive approach including the distribution of coupons to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables, and nutrition education for program participants. The programs are designed to create incentives for participants to seek out fresh produce in venues that highlight its appeal. History =Farmers' Market Nutrition Program= The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Act of 1992 that established the FMNP was introduced to the House of Representatives on November 5, 1991, by Democratic Representative Dale Kildee, and was co-sponsored by Democratic Representative William D. Ford and Republican Representative William F. Goodling. The purpose of the act was to authorize grants for state programs designed to: (1) provide nutritious unprepared foods (such as fruits and vegetables) from farmers' markets to women, infants, and children who are nutritionally at risk; and (2) expand the awareness and use of farmers' markets and increase their sales. The bill passed in the House on June 22, 1992, and in the Senate on June 23, 1992. It was signed by President George H. W. Bush and became Public Law No. 102-314 on July 2, 1992. The act amended the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to make the special supplemental food (WIC) farmers' market program permanent and open to all states.\\"Bill Summary & Status 102nd Congress (1991 - 1992) H.R.3711 All Information\\", U.S. Library of Congress, undated. Accessed 21 October 2011. Three nondiscretionary provisions were mandated in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 regarding the FMNP including the option to authorize roadside stands, a reduction in the required amount of state matching funds, and an increase in the maximum Federal benefit level. These changes were intended to increase state agency flexibility in managing the FMNP Program. The first two provisions became effective on October 1, 2004, while the increased maximum Federal FMNP benefit level was effective as of June 30, 2004.\\"WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP): Nondiscretionary Provisions of Public Law 108-265, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004\\" , U.S. Department of Agriculture (official website) Accessed 20 October 2011 The program was reauthorized through 2015 by Congress in the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which was signed by President Barack Obama on December 13, 2010 and became Public Law 111-296.\\"Bill Summary & Status 111th Congress (2009 - 2010) S.3307\\", U.S. Library of Congress, undated. Accessed 19 November 2011. Most recently, FMNP is funded at approximately $22.3 million for Fiscal Year 2018. =Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program= In 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) as a pilot program to improve the diets of low-income seniors. The SFMNP has three purposes: (1) to provide fresh, nutritious, fruits and vegetables from farmers' markets, roadside stands and community supported agriculture; (2) to increase the consumption of agricultural commodities; and (3) to aid in the development of new and additional farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supported agricultural programs.\\"USDA Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program\\" , National Resource Center on Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging Florida International University, undated.

The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, known as the 2008 Farm Bill, provided $20.6 million annually to operate the program through 2012, and made minor amendments to the program including the exclusion of SFMNP benefits in determining income eligibility for other federal assistance programs and the prohibition of the collection of state or local taxes on purchase of food with SFMNP benefits.\\"Bill Text 110th Congress (2007-2008) H.R.6124 Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008\\", U.S. Library of Congress, undated. Accessed 21 October 2011. Program Implementation =Farmers' Market Nutrition Program= The FMNP is administered through a federal/state partnership in which the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) provides cash grants to state agencies such as state agriculture departments or health departments. Participating state agencies must provide matching funds for the program in an amount that is equal to at least 30 percent of the administrative cost of the program, except Indian Tribal Organizations which may provide a negotiated match contribution that is less than 30 percent but not less than 10 percent.\\"WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP)\\", United States Department of Agriculture undated. Accessed 19 November 2011 In fiscal year 2010, grants to states ranged from $6,337 to $3,593,015. State agencies must submit a State Plan describing the manner in which the state agency intends to implement, operate and administer all aspects of the FMNP within its jurisdiction. Each state agency is responsible for authorizing participating individual farmers, farmers‚Äô markets, and roadside stands. Only authorized producers may accept and redeem FMNP coupons. Participating farmers' markets are selected to participate in the programs based in part on hours of market operation, market location, and the amount and proportion of sales involving fresh, unprocessed fruits and vegetables covered by the FMNP to ensure the greatest accessibility to program participants. The federal food coupon benefit level for FMNP recipients may not be less than $10 and no more than $30 per year, per recipient. However, state agencies may supplement the federal benefit level. FMNP vouchers are worth $19 on average per person per year. Coupons are submitted to the state agency for reimbursement. Nutrition education is provided by the state agency along with the coupons to improve and expand recipients‚Äô diets by adding fresh fruits and vegetables and to educate them on how to select and prepare the foods purchased with their coupons. Certain foods are not eligible for purchase with FMNP benefits including dried fruits or vegetables, potted fruit or vegetable plants, potted or dried herbs, wild rice, nuts of any kind (even raw), eggs, maple syrup, cider, honey, and molasses. =Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program= The SFMNP is similarly administered through a federal/state partnership. State agencies such as the State Department of Agriculture, Aging, or Health typically administers the program on a state level. The federal SFMNP benefit level, whether a household or individual, may not be less than $20 per year or more than $50 per year. State agencies may also supplement the benefit level with state, local or private funds. SFMNP vouchers are worth $35 on average per person per year. Eligible foods to be purchased with SFMNP coupons include fresh, nutritious, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, honey, and fresh-cut herbs. State agencies may limit SFMNP sales to specific foods that are locally grown in order to encourage SFMNP recipients to support the farmers in their own states. Certain foods are not eligible for purchase with SFMNP benefits including dried fruits or vegetables, potted fruit or vegetable plants, potted or dried herbs, wild rice, nuts of any kind (even raw), eggs, maple syrup, cider, and molasses. Nutrition education is also provided to SFMNP recipients by the state agency, often through an arrangement with the local WIC agency or through a cooperating senior center. =Controversy= Uneven state implementation has created controversy surrounding the FMNP and the SFMNP as states maintain significant leeway in how they administer the program. While the rules regarding the program are uniform across all states, the scale and methods of implementation are noticeably diverse. The median annual funding level for a state FMNP is around $300,000, and, in general, there is a correlation between state population and FMNP funding. State agencies that applied at the start of each program have had longer to request expansion funds. Large states like California, Texas, and New York boast annual funding of well over $1 million. However, as the two cases below demonstrate, smaller states in which the farmers market culture is still in its nascent phase have struggled to adequately administer the program to serve all eligible recipients. Unequal funding levels among states combined with significant leeway in state administration of the programs reveal points of contention regarding the implementation and effectiveness of both the FMNP and the SFMNP. Tennessee In the summer of 2011, turmoil hit a Memphis farmers' market when an influx of senior citizens flocked to the market to use their SFMNP vouchers. The farmers' market was not equipped to handle the sheer number of customers. Lines, up to three hours long, were prohibitive for the elderly and the few farmers at the market that were certified to accept SFMNP vouchers quickly sold out of their produce. The state of Tennessee's decision to limit voucher use to food grown only by Tennessee farmers; the elimination of an option to use vouchers at roadside stands; miscommunication; and an inefficient and prohibitive farmer certification system were to blame for this volatile situation. The Memphis farmers' market experience with the SFMNP underscores the way in which state implementation of the program can in fact deter recipients from redeeming their coupons and highlights the problems endemic to individual state implementation of the program.\\"Food Fight Turmoil at the Memphis Farmers Market exposes flaws in Tennessee‚Äôs food-voucher system\\" Sayle, Hannah. 2011 August 18. Accessed on 7 November 2011 Mississippi The state of Mississippi has also run into problems with state implementation of the programs. Because of limited state funding for the FMNP, Mississippi is extremely selective in what counties and markets the program is implemented. As a result, recipients can currently use vouchers in only five markets (out of sixty in the whole state) and one farm stand. Limited financial resources have also restricted selection of program participants. If Mississippi offered all WIC participants FMNP vouchers at the current rate, the state could only cover three counties with the program. Participation =States= Farmers' Market Nutrition Program In fiscal year 2011, grants were awarded to 46 state agencies and federally recognized Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs): District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and 36 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program In fiscal year 2011, grants were awarded to 51 state agencies and federally recognized Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) to operate the SFMNP: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Chickasaw Nation (Oklahoma), Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Five Sandoval Pueblos (New Mexico), Florida, Georgia, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa & Chippewa Indians (Michigan), Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Oklahoma, Osage Nation (Oklahoma), Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, San Felipe Pueblo (New Mexico), South Carolina, Standing Rock Sioux (North Dakota), Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Expansion New State agencies are selected based on the availability of funds after base grants for currently participating state agencies are funded. FMNP regulations thus stipulate that maintaining funding at the same level for states already participating in FMNP takes priority in allocation of funds over program expansion either by increasing funding in existing states or by funding new states hoping to participate in the program. These stipulations combined with stagnate overall funding for the FMNP indicate that program expansion into new states is not a priority. =Recipients= In fiscal year 2010, 2.15 million WIC participants received FMNP benefits out of 9.17 million total monthly WIC recipients.\\"Women, Infants and Children Frequently Asked Questions about WIC\\" United States Department of Agriculture undated Accessed 19 November 2011 In fiscal year 2010, 844,999 low-income seniors received SFMNP benefits. =Farmers= In fiscal year 2010, 18,245 farmers, 3,647 farmers' markets and 2,772 roadside stands were authorized to accept FMNP coupons. Coupons redeemed through the FMNP resulted in over $15.7 million in revenue to farmers for fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2010, 106 farmers at 4,601 farmers' markets as well as 3,681 roadside stands and 163 community supported agriculture programs were authorized to accept SFMNP coupons. Academic Research =Health and Nutrition Benefits= Available research permits no firm conclusions about the impact of the FMNP and SFMNP on participants‚Äô consumption of fresh produce or on any associated nutrition-related effects because of methodological limitations. The extremely low value of the benefits provided in the programs has also been noted to severely limit their ability to drastically improve the diets of program participants. The results of the following studies do, however, provide insights into how the programs may influence fruit and vegetable intake and change behaviors and perceptions related to healthy eating. *Comparing women from WIC and the FMNP, Kropf et al. (2007), of the School of Human and Consumer Sciences at Ohio University, Athens, found that although household food security status or perceived health status did not differ based on FMNP participation, women who participated in the FMNP had a greater perceived diet quality, greater perceived benefit of fruit and vegetable intake, and were at advanced stages of change with regard to fruit and vegetable intake. Further, vegetable intake servings were greater among FMNP participants.Kropf, Mary L., David H. Holben, John P. Holcomb Jr., and Heidi Anderson. 2007. \\"Food Security Status and Produce Intake and Behaviors of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program Participants.\\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association 107: 1903-1908 *Kunkel et al. (2003), of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Clemson University, conducted a survey by mail with a random sample of 1500 SFMNP recipients in South Carolina and found that based on purchasing behavior and self-reports of behavior change, seniors participating in the SFMNP in South Carolina increased their overall fruit and vegetable consumption.Kunkel, Mary E., Barbara Luccia, and Archie C. Moore. 2003. \\"Evaluation of the South Carolina Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Education Program\\"Journal of the American Dietetic Association 103(7): 880-883 =Nutrition Education= The nutrition education component of the FMNP has also been studied by researchers seeking to better understand the effects of the information distributed on program outcomes. *In an economic evaluation of the FMNP, Just and Weninger (1997), economists from the University of Maryland at College Park, and Utah State University respectively, found that the magnitude of the benefit of the FMNP depends heavily on the benefits of information distributed along with the coupons. Specifically, distributed information improves recipients' abilities to transform fruits and vegetables into better-tasting food or better health; demand is enhanced; and participants benefit directly through increased consumption and indirectly by greater valuation of all fruit and vegetable consumption.Just, R. E. and Q. Weninger. 1997. ‚ÄúEconomic Evaluation of the Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program.‚Äù American Journal of Agricultural Economics 79: 902-917 *Anderson et al. (2001) of the Michigan Department of Community Health, the Michigan Public Health Institute, and Michigan State University similarly found through a self-administered survey questionnaire of 455 WIC recipients that combining education about the use, storage, and nutritional value of fruits and vegetables with the use of coupons was critical to the success of the FMNP in Michigan.Anderson, J., D. Bybee, R. Brown, D. McLean, E. Garcia, M. L. Breer, and B. Schillo. 20011. \\"5 A Day Fruit and Vegetable Intervention Improves Consumption in a Low Income Population\\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association 101(2):195-202 =Collaboration= Federal/state collaborations define the implementation of both the FMNP and SFMNP. The two research projects below focus on the importance of collaboration in increasing the effectiveness of the FMNP. *In New York State, three agencies undertook a statewide initiative to increase the effectiveness of the FMNP. In an analysis of this initiative, Conrey et al. (2003), of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University, found that enhanced effectiveness of the program as measured by increased redemption rates was possible through a coordinated, collaborative initiative with activities at state and local levels including inter-agency collaboration; hiring a coordinating staff person to focus on the program; supporting capacity building at the local level; and making available high quality resources for program implementation.Conrey, Elizabeth, J., Edward A. Frongillo, Jamie S. Dollahite, and Matthew R. Griffin.2003. \\"Integrated Program Enhancements Increased Utilization of Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.\\" Journal of Nutrition 133:1841-184 *In another study of a collaboration initiative based on the typology of a ‚Äò‚Äòcomprehensive, multisectorial collaboration‚Äô‚Äô to support the FMNP, Dollahite et al. (2005) also of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University, found that collaboration efforts that provided partners with the opportunity to work cooperatively and innovatively improved outcomes for both low-income participants and farmers. Positive outcomes resulted from improved communication and understanding. Community capacity building occurred through the development of strategies to decrease barriers to FMNP participation.Dollahite, J. S., J. A. Nelson, E. A. Frongillo, and M. R. Griffin. 2005. ‚ÄúBuilding Community Capacity Through Enhanced Collaboration in the Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program.‚Äù Agriculture and Human Values 22: 339-354. =Barriers to Participation= The average FMNP coupon redemption rate between 1994 - 2006 was 59 percent with $28,076,755 issued per year in coupons and $16,616,6855 redeemed.\\"WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP): Nondiscretionary Provisions of Public Law 108-265, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004\\", Federal Register: The Daily Journal of the United States Government. official website. accessed 10 December 2011 Several important barriers have been identified to participation in the FMNP. *Caines (2004) in collaboration with The Farmers' Market Alliance and Just Harvest: A Center for Action Against Hunger in Pennsylvania conducted surveys in the waiting rooms of WIC offices in Pennsylvania to ascertain barriers WIC FMNP recipients encounter when redeeming their WIC FMNP checks. Inconvenient market hours were identified as the primary barrier preventing FMNP recipients from shopping at farmers' markets, followed by location and lack of transportation.Caines, Roxanne. 2004. \\"The WIC Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program in Allegheny County: Barriers to Participation and Recommendations for a Stronger Future\\" =Farmer Benefits= United States Department of Agriculture farm subsidies disproportionately benefit commodity crop farmers while farmers who grow fruits and vegetables typically receive no regular direct subsidies.\\"The Washington Post\\" 3 October 2011. Allen, Arthur. \\"U.S. Touts Fruit and Vegetables while Subsidizing Animals that Become Meat\\" Many small growers then rely on the guaranteed income from the 2008 farm bill‚Äôs $15 million Seniors Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program and the separate $25 million Farmers‚Äô Market Nutrition Program.The New York Times 10 May 2007. Kummer, Corby. \\"Less Green at the Farmers' Market\\" As such, benefits to farmers on the production end of the FMNP and SFMNP have also been the subject of academic research. *Surveying 102 farmers in South Carolina by mail (53 percent of whom returned the survey) regarding their experiences participating in the SFMNP, Kunkel et al. (2003) discovered that farmers reported positive opinions about the program for both seniors and themselves and expressed a desire for advance notice about the program to prepare for the next year‚Äôs crop as many reported running out of fruits and vegetables by the end of the program in September. *From a survey administered in six states (Iowa, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Washington) exploring the economics of the FMNP, Just and Weninger (1997) found that farmers' profits increased by about 8 percent of coupon redemption at the state level, as farmers gain about 7 to 9 percent of the amount of coupon redemption.

Ecstasy overdose On 14 July 2002, ten-year-old Jade visited family friends Wayne Wood, 22, and Rebecca Hodgson, 21, to see their newborn baby. Whilst there, she uncovered high strength ecstasy tablets hidden in a cigarette box, and mistakening them for sweets, she took five of them. She overheated, so Wood and Hodgson put her under the shower in a futile bid to cool her down. It wasn't until the arrival of other relatives 90 minutes later, that an ambulance was called and Jade was rushed to hospital. Death and legacy Jade died at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary that day. Wood and Hodgson were cleared of manslaughter, but Wood was jailed when he admitted to selling ecstasy. Jade's best friend told a court that Jade started ‚Äúacting funny‚Äù, moaning and begging to be kissed. She gave video-link evidence to Manchester Crown Court about the tragedy, and said Jade first went to a bedroom to lie down. She returned 15 to 20 minutes later ‚Äúacting funny‚Äù. Her friend said: ‚ÄúShe started speaking and shaking about at the same time. She couldn‚Äôt sit down for two minutes. She was slapping herself and saying, Stop slapping me‚Äô.‚Äù She also said 17-year-old Kim Speak got Jade to admit she had taken two pills. Coronation Street storyline On 17 September 2007, ITV1's Coronation Street aired a storyline that saw the seven- year-old character Bethany Platt swallow an ecstasy pill that had been hidden inside her doll's head. There were rumours that the storyline could have been inspired by Jade's death, and Jade's mother, Beverly, told The Sun that she only decided to watch the episodes after \\"days of inner turmoil\\". She also said \\"If Coronation Street can get that message over and spare another family from going through the nightmare we‚Äôve endured then it will do some good. If it gets the message across properly then I have to support it\\".

He returned to Iraq in 2007 after 18 years. In Iraq, he hosted the radio show To Whoever listens for Radio Demozy, an independent station, a year later. He was a well known, outspoken critic of the Iraqi government, known for tackling subjects other journalists would not discuss. He was known for criticizing the Iraqi government for being corrupt, not distributing water and food to its citizens, and the country's ineffective educational system. He was becoming more widely known for organizing and participating in anti-government 2011 Iraqi protests.  Death  On 8 September 2011, the day before nationwide protests against the Iraqi government were set to take place, Mahdi was shot twice in the head at his home in the Al-Karada neighborhood of Baghdad. He had made references in his writings and in his latest radio broadcasts that he had received written threats on his life and threatening phone calls. Mahdi had been the host of a radio show that aired three times a week, but he had not made a show in two months out of a need for safety. Reports indicate that none of his valuables had been taken from his house, further solidifying that his murder was motivated by his political stances.  Context  Mahdi's career as a journalist occurred during a transition period in Iraq as the United States was drawing down force levels and the Iraqi government was assuming more control. His criticisms were focused at what he called a corrupt Iraqi government taking advantage of the people and lacking respect for democratic process and human rights. Mahdi was a voice for the people.

It was re-activated in 1974, flying Cessna 185s as an army liaison squadron until 1991 when it disbanded for the final time. History 11 Squadron served in two periods during World War II, in East Africa and again later in Egypt and Italy. It was formed on 11 December 1939 at Waterkloof Flying Station equipped with 24 Hawker Hartbees in an army co-operation role, moving to Kenya in May 1940.The squadron flew from Waterkloof on 19 May to Pietersburg and then Bulawayo, 20 May Bulawayo ‚Äì Salisbury ‚Äì Broken Hill; 21 May Broken Hill ‚Äì Mpika; 22 May Mpika ‚Äì Mbeya ‚Äì Dodoma ‚Äì Moshi and on 23 May Moshi ‚Äì Nairobi. The squadron received its first Fairey Battle in June 1940 and by 19 August all of the Hartbees aircraft had been replaced by Fairey Battles deployed from Archers Post in Kenya.The Hawker Hartbees were passed on to 40 Sqn SAAF. It served in a reconnaissance and army cooperation role in Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia until June 1941 when its aircraft were transferred to 15 Squadron and 11 Squadron was disbanded. The squadron was re-formed on 29 June 1944 at Almaza in Egypt flying Mk.VB and Mk.VC Spitfires in the role of fighter squadron. It was moved to Edku in July 1944 and to Perugia in Italy in September 1944 ‚Äì where it exchanged the Spitfires for Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk.IVs as part of the Desert Air Force. In Italy, the squadron was part of No.8 (S.A.A.F.) Wing responsible for ground-attack and fighter-bomber sweeps in support of the armies in Italy until the end of the war. In August 1945 the squadron received Spitfire Mk.IXs and was transferred back to Egypt where it remained until being disbanded on 30 October 1945. It was resurrected in January 1974 as a liaison and army cooperation squadron equipped with Cessna 185s and based at Potchefstroom Air Base. It was finally disbanded in 1991.

He graduated from Tucker County High School in 1988 and went on to earn an undergraduate degree from the Perley Isaac Reed School of Journalism at West Virginia University (1992).Phil Kabler, \\"State Beat: Officers have fast and slow starts\\", \\"wvgazette.com\\" Loughry earned a J.D. degree from Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio; an LL.M. in Law and Government and an S.J.D. (Doctor of Juridical Science) from American University's Washington College of Law, and an LL.M. in Criminology and Criminal Justice from the University of London.Justice Allen H. Loughry II, West Virginia Judiciary (as appeared November 13, 2018).Allen Loughry, West Virginia Encyclopedia (last revised November 12, 2018). Career Loughry was an assistant to U.S. Representative Harley O. Staggers, Jr. and Governor Gaston Caperton before joining the West Virginia Attorney General's Office as a senior assistant attorney general in 1997. In 2003, he left the attorney general's office to become a law clerk at the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. He also taught political science classes at the University of Charleston. In 2006, Loughry published Don‚Äôt Buy Another Vote, I Won‚Äôt Pay for a Landslide: The Sordid and Continuing History of Political Corruption in West Virginia, a review of the history of political corruption in the state.Candidates Corner: Allen Loughry, The Register Herald (October 2012). The forewords to the book were written by Senators Robert Byrd and John McCain. Election to state Supreme Court and election as chief justice In 2012, Loughry ran as a Republican for a seat on the West Virginia Supreme Court and won a 12-year term. He assumed office on January 1, 2013, succeeding Thomas McHugh, who retired from the bench. One of Loughry‚Äôs campaign ads was shown on Last Week Tonight as part of their segment on elected judges. In the ad Loughry say his last name was a combination of law and free and then said his son‚Äôs first name was Justice, as in justice law free, which led host John Oliver to parody Loughry after he showed the clip saying ‚ÄúYep. I call my son Justice, I call my dog preamble, and I call my penis the gavel! Vote for me!‚Äù A few years latter Oliver would show the ad and talk about Loughry again in his segment about S.L.A.P.P suits. This was because the show had been sued by Bob Murray after doing a separate segment about the coal industry that heavily criticized Murray. When a Judge denied the case, he appealed and the case went to the West Virginia Supreme Court and Loughry was one of the judges who would hear the case, though he never would actually hear the case as he was impeached right after Murray appealed. Oliver jokes during the segment ‚ÄúAs far as things to say about a judge before he makes a ruling on your case goes, claiming that he calls his penis the gavel is maybe not the best choice!‚Äù In April 2017, Loughry was selected to serve as Chief Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court for a four-year term. It was the first time a chief justice would serve four consecutive years since 1888. Previously, the chief justice had been elected by the Supreme Court to serve a one-year term, with a few justices serving two years in a row, but the court \\"voted to change its rules to provide for the chief justice to serve a four-year term and to allow the chief justice to be re-elected to subsequent four-year terms by a majority vote of the members of the court.\\" Scandal =Federal prosecution and conviction= In late 2017, reports came to light of high spending by Loughry and Justice Robin Davis totaling well more than a million dollars, and at an emergency meeting, he was replaced as Chief Justice by Justice Margaret Workman. On June 20, 2018, he was arrested at his home by the FBI, and later in the day Michael B. Stuart, United States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, announced that a grand jury had indicted Loughry on 22 counts, including 16 counts of frauds and swindles, two counts of wire fraud, one count of witness tampering, and three counts of lying to federal investigators. Loughry‚Äôs federal criminal trial began on October 2. The trial concluded ten days later with Loughry being convicted of seven counts of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud, one count of witness tampering and two counts of lying to the FBI. The jury found Loughry not guilty on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of mail fraud. They also deadlocked on one count of wire fraud after United States District Judge John Copenhaver refused to issue an Allen charge to the jury concerning this count. Loughry was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison on February 13, 2019 and is currently an inmate of FCI Williamsburg in South Carolina. =Suspension from office, impeachment proceedings, and resignation= On June 6, 2018, the state Judicial Ethics Committee charged Loughry with 32 counts of violation of the code of judicial ethics. The Supreme Court, reconstituted with four circuit judges and a retired circuit judge, appointed for that purpose, suspended him without pay until further notice.https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/11/11/west-virginia- supreme-court-justice/ On June 26, 2018, Governor Jim Justice called the West Virginia Legislature into special session to consider Loughry's impeachment. Following a series of controversies involving excessive spending, the House of Delegates, on the recommendation of the House Judiciary Committee, voted to impeach Loughry and justices Davis, Workman and Beth Walker on August 13, 2018 \\"for maladministration, corruption, incompetency, neglect of duty, and certain high crimes and misdemeanors\\". The fifth Supreme Court Judge, Menis Ketchum, had already pled guilty to wire fraud and resigned. On November 9, 2018, Governor Jim Justice called the West Virginia Legislature into another special session to correct the procedural errors of the prior impeachment proceedings. On November 12, 2018--one day before the state legislature was to convene in special session to consider whether Loughry should be Impeached and removed from office--Loughry resigned. Awards and honors In 2013, the American University Washington College of Law awarded Loughry its Distinguished Alumnus Award.Press Release, West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Allen Loughry to Receive Distinguished Alumnus Award at American University Washington College of Law, American University Washington College of Law (September 23, 2013).

Through that relationship Monaco directly participates in certain EU policies. Monaco is an integral part of the EU customs territory and VAT area, and therefore applies most measures on excise duties and VAT.The EU's relations with Monaco, European External Action Service, September 2011 Monaco borders one EU member state: France. However this relationship does not extend to external trade. Preferential trade agreements between the EU and third countries apply only to goods originating from the customs territory ‚Äì Monaco may not claim EU origin in this respect. Monaco is a de facto member of the Schengen area (its borders and customs territory are treated as part of France) and it officially uses the euro as its sole currency. It uses the euro via an agreement with the EU and France and is allowed by the EU to mint its own coins. Monaco uses the euro as it previously had its currency tied 1:1 with the French franc. The two have also concluded agreements on the application of Community legislation to pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products and medical devices (this entered into force on 1 May 2004); and on savings taxation (in force since 1 July 2005). Future integration EU membership for Monaco is unlikely as, aside from its size, unlike the constitutional monarchies within the EU, the Prince of Monaco has considerable executive powers and is not merely a figurehead. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, a move that required it to renegotiate its relations with France, which previously had the right to nominate various ministers. This was seen as part of a general move toward Europe. In November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an evaluation of the EU's relations with the sovereign European microstates of Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, which they described as \\"fragmented\\", the European Commission published a report outlining options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike Liechtenstein, which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) via the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the Schengen Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to the current situation: 1) a Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area, 2) a comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states, 3) EEA membership, and 4) EU membership. The Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was dismissed in the near future because \\"the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries.\\" The remaining options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the Commission. In response, the Council requested that negotiations with the three microstates on further integration continue, and that a report be prepared by the end of 2013 detailing the implications of the two viable alternatives and recommendations on how to proceed. As EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU members, the consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr St√∏re, the then Foreign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market due to their different requirements than large countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, St√∏re's successor, responded to the Commission's report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway was open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decide to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organization. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside of both the EFTA and the EU, should be given consideration. On 18 November 2013 the EU Commission published their report which concluded that \\"the participation of the small-sized countries in the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political and institutional reasons\\", but that Association Agreements were a more feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market, preferably via a single multilateral agreement with all three states. In December 2014 the Council of the European Union approved negotiations being launched on such an agreement, and they began in March 2015.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Evansville. The cathedral, rectory and original school building are contributing properties in the Lincolnshire Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. History =St. Benedict Parish= Original parish building Cathedral interior St. Benedict Parish was established in 1912 to take care of the Catholics who lived east of the downtown area. The pastoral care for the parish was given to Benedictine Monks from St. Meinrad Abbey. A two-story brick building was constructed to serve as a combination church and school. It was designed by local architect Frank J. Schlotter in the Neoclassical style. with It was built by local contractor, and parishioner, Michael J. Hoffman. An assembly hall was located in the basement, classrooms were located on the first floor, and the church sanctuary was on the second floor. After the present church building was completed in 1928, the second floor was converted into classroom space. A Modern movement addition was completed in 1953. A two- story, brick, American Foursquare convent was built for the teaching sisters in 1913. A rectory for the resident clergy was completed in 1921 for $25,000. The two-story brick structure was designed by August Gehlhausen in the Colonial Revival style. It features a two-story, full length, front porch. The present church building was completed in 1928 in the Lombard-Basilica style. It was designed by local architect Edward J. Thole of the architectural firm of Thole & Legeman. Parishioner Michael Hoffman again served as the contractor. The church features ceilings that are high, a baldachin over the altar and a seating capacity of over 1,000 people. Zettler Art Glass Company of Munich, Germany produced the stained glass windows. The altars are composed of Italian marble. The campanile rises . The church was dedicated on March 18, 1928, by Abbot Athanasius Schmidt, OSB. The interior of the church was renovated after the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. The baldachin was moved forward about and the former high altar was dismantled and a new altar was created. Two of Evansville's bishops were ordained and installed in St. Benedict's before it became a cathedral; Francis R. Shea in 1970 and Gerald A. Gettelfinger on April 11, 1989. = St. Benedict Cathedral = On October 21, 1944, Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Evansville. Assumption Church, Evansville's oldest Catholic parish, was chosen as the first cathedral. The property was sold to the city of Evansville who demolished it in 1965 for the new civic center. Holy Trinity, Evansville's second-oldest parish, served as the Proto-cathedral from 1965 to April 11, 1999, when St. Benedict's was consecrated as the third cathedral for the Evansville Diocese.

Administratively it is fully part of the borough of Tharandt today and bears a legally-protected straplineMarken-Nr.: DE 39401066, accessed on 6 June 1995 with the text: Tharandter Wald ‚Äì sch√∂nster Wald Sachsens (\\"Tharandt Forest - Saxony's most beautiful forest\\"), which goes back to the tourist advertisements of the 1920s.  History  In the 12th century, the village of Warnsdorf existed for a short time in the middle of the forest by the water-rich Warnsdorf Spring of the Triebisch river. The foundations of a large Roman site from the 13th century were discovered in the neighbouring village of Grillenburg which, then as now, was completely surrounded by the forest. Several routes run through the forest, including the Princes' or Lords' Way. During the Early Modern Period the forest was a hunting ground for the territorial princes (Grillenburg Hunting Lodge) and was also a source of timber and charcoal for mining (charcoal burning) and the residence city of Dresden (timber rafting). Forest glassworks are also discernible near Hetzdorf (Glasergrund) and Hartha (Glasbruch). The beekeepers and forest keepers (collectively called Zeidler) that settled in F√∂rdergersdorf and Hartha supplied honey and beeswax. And artificial ponds are still used today to farm fish. In the early 18th century in the T√§nnichtgrund bottom near Naundorf in the Tharandt Forest was the hideaway of the notorious robber, Lips Tullian and his Black Guard (Schwarzen Garde). Tullian was feared throughout Saxony. His lair is stilled recalled by the Lips Tullian Rocks (Lips-Tullian-Felsen) named after him and the old Thieves' Chamber (Diebskammer). Around 1800 the forest had been seriously reduced by logging and was reforested by Johann Heinrich Cotta on scientific principles. The Tharandt Forest thus became a model for the concept of sustainable forest management that was born out of necessity. This resulted in the formation of the forestry academy and the botanical forest gardens in Tharandt. From the 18th century the forest was used as a place of recreation by middle-class families, especially from Dresden. These included such well-known personalities from the sciences and arts as Heinrich Ernemann and Eva von der Osten, who established their summer residences here. During the Nazi era Saxony's Gauleiter and state huntsmaster, Martin Mutschmann, used the Grillenburg hunting lodge as the headquarters of the Saxon Hunting Court (S√§chsischen J√§gerhof). Its guest house, the Neues J√§gerhaus, also used by him and acted during the GDR period as a VdN convalescent home, known as Elsa Fenske, for victims of faschism. The entire forest was a recreation area for many years and was signed by volunteers from the Cultural Association of the GDR who also laid out a nature trail. As a contiguous and easily accessible natural region the Tharandt Forest continues to act as a recreation area for the population of the surrounding area and its visitors. There are educational trails and paths for hiking, riding and cycling. Coaches and sleds are permitted on several routes. The region around the Tharandt Forest has been represented since 1997 by the Tharandt Forest Queen (Tharandter-Wald-K√∂nigin), a new one being appointed every two years and who is presented and crowned at the traditional choir gathering, the Chortreffen am Tharandter Wald by the Tharandt Forest Tourist Association (Verkehrs- und Versch√∂nerungsverein \\"Tharandter Wald\\" e.V.).

It has been traditionally used in ayurvedic medicine. It is the first member of the withanolide class of ergostane type product to be discovered. This natural product has wide range of pharmacological activities including cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastasis and anti-carcinogenic properties.  Structure  Withanolides are a group of naturally occurring C28- steroidal lactones. They contain four cycloalkane ring structures, three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring. Withaferin A is highly reactive because of the ketone-containing unsaturated A ring, the epoxide in the B ring, and the unsaturated lactone ring. The double bond in ring A and the epoxide ring are mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity. The 22nd and 26th carbons of the ergostane skeleton in withaferin A and related steroidal compounds are oxidized to form a six-membered delta lactone unit. NMR spectral analysis identifies C3 in the unsaturated A ring as the main nucleophilic target site for ethyl mercaptan, thiophenol and L-cysteine ethyl ester in vitro. A library of 2, 3-dihydro-3Œ≤-substituted derivatives are synthesized by regio/stereoselective Michael addition to ring A. These analogs are being tested for its activity in neuro-degenerative diseases, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and in cancer.  Regulation  3-azido withaferin A (3-azidoWA), a stable derivative of withaferin A, has been shown to inhibit cancer cell motility and invasion in wound healing by selectively suppressing MMP-2 activity in human cervical and prostate cell lines. It enhances the secretion of Par-4 which in turn suppresses MMP-2 expression and activity that is required for tumor metastasis. 3-azidoWA acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing Par-4, TIMP-1 and by reducing the levels of pAkt and pERK that are activated in various cancers. This finding has augmented the therapeutic potential of the pro-apoptotic protein Par-4 in cancer. Researchers have shown that 3-azidoWA abrogated neovascularisation in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Withaferin A has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in HUVECs at significantly lower doses through the inhibition of Cyclin D1 expression. Inhibition of cell proliferation is due to the cytostatic nature of withaferin, resulting in cell arrest in the G0G1 phase of the cell cycle. Researchers have shown that withaferin A has an anti-angiogenic activity in vivo at doses much lower than required for its anti-tumor activity. = Regulation of transcription factor NF-Œ∫B = NF-Œ∫B is a transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in cell survival, growth, immune response and angiogenesis. Withaferin A inhibits NF-Œ∫B at a very low concentration by targeting the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway (UPP) in endothelial cells. Scientists believe that the site at which withaferin acts on UPP must be different from the site of action of 20s proteasome inhibitor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that withaferin A interferes with TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B activation at the level or upstream of IKKŒ≤. It also inhibits other transcription factors including Ap1 and Sp1 which are important mediators of many signalling pathways that are down-regulated by various chemotherapeutic agents. It can induce oxidative stress, alter gene expression, depolarize mitochondria. Withaferin A also down regulates VEGF gene expression and can affect calcium signaling. Mohan et al. showed that withaferin A could inhibit endothelial cell proliferation at low concentrations and thus non-toxic to cells. = Regulation of heat shock proteins = Researchers have demonstrated the regulation of Hsp90 co-chaperone CDC37 through direct irreversible binding of withaferin A to C-terminus of Hsp90. Withaferin induces aggregation of Hsp90, dissociation of Hsp90- CDC37 complex and down regulation of Hsp90 target proteins mediated through proteasomal degradation. Induction of heat shock response by withaferin provides cytoprotective property whereas inhibition of heat shock protein activity will lead to apoptosis. This dual property of withaferin on heat shock protein might be due to the concentration of withaferin and cellular content.  Properties  = Anti-inflammatory = Withania extracts suppresses the production of various pro-inflammatory molecules in many in vitro models. Anti-inflammatory property of withaferin A has been attributed to its ability to suppress alpha-2 macroglobulin, NF-Œ∫B and AP1. Several withanolides selective inhibition of enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that increases during inflammation. = Anti-tumor = The anti-tumor activity of withaferin A was tested on human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3 and confirmed in PC-3 xenografts in nude mice. It exhibits androgen receptor (AR) dependent cytotoxicity. It inhibits tumor growth through ATP- independent inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in in vivo pancreatic model. It exhibits growth- inhibitory properties in cancer cell culture experiments, suggesting its cytotoxic and apoptotic properties. It increases Mcl-1 expression levels inducing apoptosis in vitro breast cancer models. It binds to intermediate filament protein, vimentin by covalently modifying its highly conserved cysteine residue in alpha-helical colied 2B domain. Withaferin A causes aggregation of vimentin to colocalize with F-actin leading to apoptosis. = Immunosuppressive = Shohat et al., have demonstrated specific immunosuppressive effects on mouse thymocytes as well as human B and T lymphocytes by withaferin A and a related steroid lactone withanolide E. At very low concentrations, these molecules inhibit the E rosette and EAC rosette formation by normal B and T lymphocytes. Withaferin A has a specific action on antigen recognition and proliferative capacity of both B and T lymphocytes. = Cell motility and invasion = Withaferin A inhibits cell motility and invasion capacity of cancer cells through MMP-2 by induction of Par-4. Since a critical event in cancer metastasis is the ability of these cells to invade the extracellular matrix (ECM), inhibition of invasive property by withaferin can contain the cancer cells to primary site. Colony forming ability of cancer cells were attenuated by withaferin derivative in a dose dependent manner.Actin is required for various cellular processes including oriented growth, adhesion and migration. Withaferin A can alter cytoskeleton architecture by covalently binding to multifunctional adaptor protein annexin II and by stimulating the basal F-actin cross linking activity. = Anti- angiogenesis = It is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of withaferin A is due to the inhibition of chymotrypsin whereas the induction of apoptosis is due to the inhibition of protein kinase C. Caspase-3 activation by withaferin A has also been reported.  Clinical relevance  = Cancer = Cervical cancer is caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) expressing E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which inactivate the tumor suppressor protein p53 and pRb respectively. Withaferin A was found to down regulate expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins, induce accumulation of p53, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest, alters the expression levels of apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax and caspase3. In athymic mice model, withaferin reduced 70% of the tumor volume. Therefore, withaferin A can be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cervical cancer without major side effects. Withaferin A has been shown to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in certain cell lines. However, its mechanism of action on cell death is not well understood. It has been suggested that sensitization of cancer cells to radiation is due to the inhibition of NF-Œ∫B. It exhibits anti-tumor as well as anti-inflammatory activities. It can act as an immuno-suppressant by inhibiting NF-Œ∫B activation. In animal models, it prevented skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation. The antioxidant property of withaferin aid in the prevention of DNA damage by mutagens; in combination with detoxifying, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, it can contribute to the chemopreventive action. Withaferin A binds to and inhibits vimentin preventing breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. It increases the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and MAPK in vitro breast cancer models. It increases the expression of tumor suppressor p53, Notch 2 and Notch 4, down-regulates the expression of ERŒ±, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and growth. Notch signaling plays a significant role in the development of colon cancer, therefore targeting the Notch pathway by withaferin A can be a potential therapeutic option in treating colon cancer. Koduru et al., demonstrated that the inhibition of Notch- mediated prosurvival by withaferin A facilitates c-Jun-NH2-kinase-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines. Withaferin A downregulates vimentin expression leading to structural perturbation of intermediary filaments. Cancer cells express enhanced vimentin expression and correlates with the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, poor prognosis and decreased survival rate. Further, caspase- dependent degradation of vimentin by withaferin A was observed. Combining various properties like anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic and antiproliferation makes withaferin A a potential drug candidate for treatment of cancer. Studies in animal models has shown promising results for breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer among others. = Other diseases = Sen et al., have demonstrated that in Leishmania donovani, withaferin A inhibits PKC resulting in depolarization of Delta Psi(m) and generation of reactive oxygen species in the cell. Depolarization leads to the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase- likeprotease and DNA fragmentation, finally leading to apoptosis. Animal and in vitro studies have shown antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteridis and Salmonella typhimurium. Withania roots have demonstrated chondroprotective effects in vitro arthritis model. The herb is also used in treatment of iron-deficiency anemia due to its effects on haematopoiesis and natural iron content. Withaferin A is also used in the treatment of Metabolic syndrome [20].  Biosynthesis  Biosynthesis of Withaferin A In the withania somnifera plant, the withanolide, Withaferin A, is present in the leaves. Withanolides are terpenoids, which are synthesized in plants using isoprenoids as precursors. Isoprenoids can be synthesized through mevalonate (MVA) or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) pathways. Isoprenogenesis significantly governs withanolide synthesis.Chaurasiya, N.D., Sangwan, N.S., Sabir, F. et al. ‚ÄúWithanolide biosynthesis recruits both mevalonate and DOXP pathways of isoprenogenesis in Ashwagandha Withania somnifera L.‚Äù Plant Cell Reports (2012) 31: 1889. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-012-1302-4 Isoprenoids form squalene, which then goes through a variety of intermediate steps to form 24-methylenecholesterol - the sterol precursor of the withanolides.Lockley, W.J.S., Rees, H.H., Goodwin, T.W. ‚ÄúBiosynthesis of steroidal withanolides in Withania Somnifera‚Äù Phytochemistry (1976) 15:937-939. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-9422(00)84374-5 The biosynthesis of Withaferin A utilizes a variety of enzymes such as squalene epoxidase (SQE), cycloartenol synthase (CAS), sterol methyl transferase (SMT), obtusifoliol-14 ‚Äìdemethylase (ODM). Upregulation of expression of these key enzymes could potentially enhance Withaferin A content in the leaves.Pandey, S.S., Singh, S., Pandey, H. et al. ‚ÄúEndophytes of Withania somniferamodulate in planta content and the site of withanolide biosynthesis‚Äù Scientific Reports (2018) 8:5450. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23716-5 Lactone ring formation in Withaferin A biosynthesis.

It is the first story of the fifth and last series. In this episode, Sky Smith joins the main cast. Plot =Part 1= A meteor crashes in a junk yard to reveal a metal man. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane discovers a baby on her doorstep who can create power surges. Sarah Jane and Rani travel to the site of the meteor crash and are met by Professor Rivers, who investigates the site with them. Sarah Jane and Rani find a homeless man who saw the metal man and describes him; they then discover that the metal man is heading to Bannerman Road. Meanwhile, an alien woman named Miss Myers appears at a nuclear power station and discovers that there was a power surge on Bannerman Road. She goes to the road and to the garden where Clyde and the baby named Sky are about to be attacked by the metal man. Miss Myers saves Clyde and Sky, then reveals that she is Sky's mother and is an alien. Mr Smith locates Clyde at the power station, and Sarah Jane and Rani make their way there to find Clyde, Sky and Miss Myers who reveals that her species, the Fleshkind, are fighting a war against the Metalkind. Sky is a weapon who will end the war. The Metalkind walks in, and Sky then transforms from a baby into a twelve-year-old girl. =Part 2= At Miss Myers' command, Sky unintentionally attacks the Metalkind with a burst of energy. Miss Myers reveals that Sky was made and \\"grown\\" in a Fleshkind laboratory as a weapon to destroy the Metalkind. Sarah Jane and the gang escapes with Sky. Miss Myers tells the metal man he will help her get Sky and has him wired up. Mr Smith concludes that Sky's metamorphosis was caused by her synthetic DNA and was done to maximise her effectiveness as a bomb. At the power station, Sarah Jane goes inside, and Sky follows. Sarah Jane, who is taken to Miss Myers, learns that the damaged Metalkind is wired up to the nuclear core in order for him to act as a homing device. Miss Myers reprogrammed his mind as he swears vengeance on all flesh kind, including Earth's inhabitants. Believing that the Metalkind will be destroyed upon their arrival on Earth, she activates the calling of the Metalkind. Downstairs, Sarah Jane meets up with Sky, who tells her she must save Earth and goes to the nuclear core room. Sarah Jane orders Clyde and Rani to shut down the nuclear reactor in the control room before heading after Sky. In the control room, Clyde and Rani discover the Nuclear Rod Regulation System and remove the rods based on the order of the visible spectrum. They close the reactor as the portal closes with a large power outage. The energy from the portal backlashes on Sky, destroying her genetic programming as a bomb. Miss Myers does not want the child anymore for she is no longer a weapon. The Metalkind, who reveals that he saved some of the portal's energy, breaks loose and uses the energy as he takes Miss Myers with him. Sarah Jane explains Sky's appearance to Gita and Haresh at Bannerman Road, telling them the adoption agency had a mixup. In the attic, Sarah Jane finds the Shopkeeper and the Captain, previously met in Lost in Time. He reveals that he placed infant Sky on her doorstep. Sky chooses to stay with Sarah Jane as her adoptive daughter. Continuity * The Shopkeeper and his parrot, The Captain, previously appeared in Lost in Time. * Rani suggests that The Doctor was the one who left Sky on Sarah Jane's doorstep. Rani met the Tenth Doctor in The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, and the Eleventh Doctor in Death of the Doctor. Sarah Jane denies that it was him, claiming he would give a reason for leaving a baby on her doorstep. * Rani tells Sky about how Luke was created by aliens to invade the Earth while Clyde tells Sky about when they fought the Bane, both shown in the pilot episode \\"Invasion of the Bane\\". Production This was the first story to be aired following the death of Elisabeth Sladen. Broadcast The first part was broadcast on Monday 3 October 2011 on CBBC while the second was broadcast on the following day, Tuesday 4 October 2011, on CBBC. The two parts were then again broadcast on Thursday 10 November and Friday 11 November 2011 on BBC One and for the first time in HD on BBC One HD.

He arrived from Cuba at age of 11 in the United States with Amateur experience from La ESPA in which he represented the city of Artemisa. Professional career Socarras made his pro debut on February 25, 2011 against American-born Carlos Bruno who was also making his pro debut. After a few rabbit punches by Socarras he knocked Bruno out cold in the first round with a perfect left hook. 2 months later on April 29, 2011 he faced Puerto Rican Kenneth Calvente who was also making his pro debut. Calvente lasted the first round, but the young Socarras started pressuring Calvente on the ropes until he dropped Calvente with a straight right hand. After the knockdown Socarras again trapped Calvente in the corner and landed another straight right handed that wobbled Calvente, the referee waved off the fight giving Socarras another TKO victory. On June 24, 2011, Socarras made his debut in Miami against Anthony Fraguada at the Dade County Auditorium. The fight barely lasted 2 minutes, as Socarras floored Fraguada with a left hook that finished him off, prompting the referee to stop the fight. On August 28, 2011, Socarras faced Eduardo Melendez of Puerto Rico. After Melendez landed a few punches to Socarras, the young fighter started to trap Melendez in the corner with body shots. Late in the round Socarras landed a clean left hook clean on Melendez's chin that knocked him out cold. Many have agreed in boxing sites that this knockout is a candidate for KO of the year and put Socarras on the Prospect to watch list. On October 14 Socarras fought against Lamar Charlton. The fight was declared a split draw. Socarras returned to the ring after 10 months of no activity, to be exact on August 18, 2012 in the Double Tree Hotel. He faced DeWayne Wisdom and beat him via Unanimous Decision to improve his professional record at 5‚Äì0 with 4 KO's. On January 4, 2013, he faced up- and-coming Josh Bowles with a record of 6‚Äì0 at the Magic City Casino in Miami FL. Socarras won the bout by 3rd-round KO to improve to 6 and 0. Socarras was back in action on March 23, 2013 to face Sergio Montes de Oca. In the first round Socarras knocked de Oca down, winning the fight clearly via Unanimous Decision, with a cut over his left eye from an accidental headbutt from De Oca. Hairon Socarras improved his record to 7‚Äì0. On March 22, 2014, he won the vacant WBA Latino super bantamweight belt after scoring an impressive fourth- round knockout over Dominican, Aneudy Matos.

The simplest formulation is a set X = {x ‚àà D} where D, which can be called the 'study region,' is a subset of Rn, a n-dimensional Euclidean space. Description The easiest way to visualize a 2-D point pattern is a map of the locations, which is simply a scatterplot but with the provision that the axes are equally scaled. If D is not the boundary of the map then it should also be indicated. An empirical definition of D would be the convex hull of the points, or at least their bounding box, a matrix of the ranges of the coordinates. Another straightforward way to visualize the points is a 2D histogram (sometimes called a quadrats) that bins the points into rectangular regions. A benefit of quadrat analysis is that it forces the analysis to take into account possible scales within which statistically significant inhomogeneities may be occurring. Modeling The null model for point patterns is complete spatial randomness (CSR), modeled as a Poisson process in Rn, which implies that the number of points in any arbitrary region A in D will be proportional to the area or volume of A. Exploring models is generally iterative: if CSR is accepted not much more can be said, but if rejected, there are two avenues. First, one must decide which models are worth exploring, such as investigations of clustering, density, trends, etc. And for each of these models there are appropriate scale ranges, from the finest, which essentially mirrors the point pattern, to the coarsest, which aggregates D. It is generally interesting to explore a range of scales within these limits. A particularly robust model of clustered point patterns is diffusion, which can also be thought of as the trajectory of a point doing a random walk. Estimation Four patterns of 256 pointsA fundamental problem of PPA is inferring whether a given arrangement is merely random or the result of some process. The picture illustrates patterns of 256 points using four point processes. The clustered process results in all points having the same location. Popular models are those based on simple circles and ellipses, inter-point (and especially nearest neighbor) distances, quadrats, and intensity functions. Each model yields estimates (that can increase insights into the underlying real-world processes) as well as associated goodness-of- fit diagnostics. Applications PPA has applications in a wide range of areas, including astronomy, archaeology, geography, ecology, biology, and epidemiology. A few topics in the last area are discussed here. # A case control study compares the point patterns of organisms both with and without some condition to determine if there were significant differences in their arrangements. # Environmental exposure examines the locations of cases and possible sources (e.g. of pollution or carcinogens). # Contagion explores the temporal unfolding of the pattern, asking about such phenomena as the location of the 'index case.' # Examination of infection compares the arrangements of parasites and hosts (predators and prey, agents and organisms). # Analysis of the regularity of retinal mosaics, particularly as a quantitative tool to understand development of the retina.

The organization was established in 1990 as a collaborative effort of seven Colorado healthcare organizations: the Colorado Alliance for CME, the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, the Colorado Hospital Association, the Colorado Medical Society, the Colorado Physician Health Program, the Colorado Society of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. CPEP provides assessment and education for physicians re-entering practice. Its approach is based on the idea that education should be directed by an evaluation of the individual's educational needs and that traditional continuing medical education conferences alone may not be effective in improving practice. This is consistent with the approach of remediation programs both in the United States and internationally. Physicians take part in CPEP programs for medical ethics education and training, to address performance evaluation issues and concerns, and to help them reinstate their medical licenses. CPEP collaborates with the University of Colorado Schoolof Medicine and is led by faculty and other physician consultants who are board certified in their respective specialties. CPEP is one of five programs nationwide that have been accepted as members of the Coalition for Physician Enhancement, the primary U.S. organization representing programs that provide physician assessment and education. CPEP receives no funding from medical licensure fees or state sources. Instead, the organization is supported by participant fees and donations from the Colorado medical community, including the COPIC Companies. Assessment Testing Doctors are referred to CPEP for competency assessments from different organizations, including hospitals, medical groups and state medical boards. The CPEP approach to physician competency evaluation and assessment has three major components: clinical competence assessment, educational intervention, and post-educational evaluation. The assessment is individualized based on the physician‚Äôs practice and the concerns of the referring organization. The actual assessment includes structured clinical interviews, simulated patient encounters and written testing. This testing is overseen by a board-certified physician who acts as an associate medical director (AMD). This AMD then compiles a final report, and the physician receives recommendations for education based on their needs. ProBE The ProBE (Professional/Problem-Based Ethics) Program started in 1992 in New Jersey as collaboration between the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners and The Ethics Group, LLC. The program started as a way to provide educational intervention to physicians who were identified by the Board and had received ethical infractions. By 1996, the ProBE Program had been endorsed by 45 licensing boards and sub-specialty boards throughout the United States. In 2007, CPEP acquired The Ethics Group, LLC, and began offering the program. The ProBE Program provides education for healthcare professionals, and it focuses on ethics violations and unprofessional conduct secondary to boundary violations in the practice of healthcare. These violations can include financial irregularities, misrepresentation, sexual misconduct, disruptive behavior and substance abuse. The class is offered in Denver, Colorado and Newark, New Jersey in the United States, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Other Programs CPEP offers a Clinical Practice Reentry Program for physicians who wish to reenter the field after a voluntary absence to enhance a physician's practice, and/or restore a physician's clinical capabilities. This program evaluates the physician‚Äôs clinical skills, including structured clinical interviews and a one-day comprehensive evaluation. Physicians are then given a reentry plan, which includes supervised clinical experience to update skills and knowledge and a detailed reporting of progress. To enter this program, physicians must have left the medical field in good standing, and they must want to reenter in the same clinical practice for which they were trained. The Patient Care Documentation Seminar teaches physicians how to identify basic documentation guidelines, understand the legal issues associated with poor documentation and overcome barriers to good documentation. Physicians can receive up to eight continuing medical education credits and up to two Experience Rating System points for taking the class. The Personalized Implementation Program is the follow-up class to the Patient Care Documentation Seminar. Physicians submit three sets of charts to CPEP at two, four and six months, and they receive feedback via checklists from a medical consultant on their progress at two and four months. Physicians then contact CPEP for a telephone conference with a medical reviewer and receive a final report of their progress after the last chart is submitted.

She is the resident artist for Pioneers For A Cure - Songs To Fight Cancer, a non-profit organization that raises funds for cancer treatment, cancer research, and cancer care through song downloads. In addition to the dozens of artist portraits Sasson has painted for Pioneers For A Cure, she has illustrated and authored several children's books. Biography Born in 1965, Mira Sasson was raised in a small ultra-orthodox community in Bnei-Brak, Israel. Mira was expected to concentrate her studies on religion, and was not permitted to express herself artistically. Mira grew and quickly became a passionate artist, always seen with a pencil in hand. With no formal training, her talents excelled and easily allowed her to move on to other mediums such as oil on canvas. Her fascination with faces has been a common thread throughout her career. From the beginning, she was able to capture the inner essence of her subjects and draw the viewer into the intimacy of the painting. Her experience in oil paintings came in handy later in a project she was involved in to document PfaC artists for a project. At age 35, Mira unleashed her talent in writing. She wrote and illustrated a collection of children's books. She also wrote weekly articles for a newspaper in Bat Shemesh, Israel. In 2002, Mira moved to America. Working as a resident artist for Pioneers for a Cure, Mira painted portraits of many musical artists whose talents helped to raise funds for various cancer charities. Her work was displayed in the Salmagundi Art Club in New York City and she was honored with the \\"Pioneer of the Year Award\\". Mira was also involved with Pioneers for a Cure's creation of the first Megillah for the iPad, which showcased her talents with watercolor. In addition to her private work, Mira uses her artistic gifts to help children with special needs in The Friendship Circle. Her ongoing work with this program has enriched the lives of young children and teens. Over the last three years, Mira has developed an original technique to create unique works of art. Nails, threads, and fibers are woven on wood to create beautiful images. Included in her current show, The Fibers of Time, Mira not only unveils her latest works but also exhibits her art from her many years as an artist. Pioneers for a Cure Mira Sasson is working on a series of portraits of singers who have contributed songs to Pioneers For A Cure - Songs To Fight Cancer. These portraits include Suzanne Vega, Ben E. King, Tovah Feldshuh, Lorin Sklamberg, David Broza, Taylor Barton, Yosi Piamenta, Basya Schechter, Neshama Carlebach, Noah Solomon and Dudu Fisher. In addition, Sasson contributed the cover artwork for the September 2011 release on iTunes of the 'Israeli Songs To Fight Cancer' compilation released by Pioneers For A Cure. The collection features songs by Dov Rosenblatt, Josh Nelson, Dudu Fisher, Y-Love and others. Pioneers for a Cure Award Gala On November 22, 2009, Pioneers For A Cure celebrated its first \\"Pioneer Of The Year Award\\" with a gala event at the Salmagundi Club in New York City with more than 250 friends and supporters. Attendees were welcomed by Harold Blond, President of the Israel Children's Cancer Foundation as well as Dana Ehrlich of the Israeli Consulate. The \\"Pioneer Of The Year Award\\" was presented to Mira Sasson, whose artwork and portraits were on display at the gallery. Musical performers included Neshama Carlebach, Pharaoh's Daughter, Adrienne Cooper and Art Bailey, Greg Wall, Jeremiah Lockwood, Rashanim, Dov Rosenblatt and many more. _Friendship Circle NJ_ In 2014 Mira Sasson started working with Friendship Circle NJ, an organization that promotes awareness and understanding of the unique needs of people with special needs. Using paint and collage, Mira develops innovative art projects and guides children and teen at the program to create personal art work. The program inspires and enriches the lives of the participants while creating a seamless circle of friendship.

On May 1, 2011, he was shot to death with his own gun by his 10-year-old son Joseph. The murder took place at 4 a.m. as Hall slept on his couch. Hall was a neo-Nazi who believed in fighting for an all-white society and had said that he would die for the cause. According to the boy, the motive for the murder was that he was tired of his father hitting him and his stepmother. On September 25, 2011, the story of the murder was broadcast on 60 Minutes. In October 2013, when the boy was 13, he was sentenced to seven years in juvenile prison. Family history Jeffrey Hall was the son of Joann Patterson. He was previously married to Leticia Neal, having two children with her, Joseph and Shirley. Joseph was born June 19, 2000. The two divorced sometime after, after which Neal had twins by another father. In 2003, the twins were hospitalized for failing to thrive, resulting in Child Protective Services removing Hall's two children. Social workers reported that Neal's home had no electricity or gas, that there were maggots on dishes, and that the children were dirty, malnourished, and had bruises. At the time, Hall was on probation for driving under the influence. As a result, his two children were temporarily placed with their grandmother. In 2004, Hall was granted full custody of his children. After divorcing Neal, Hall married Krista McCary and had three more daughters with her. At the time of his death, he had five children. His former wife Neal moved out of California and remarried, then she came back to California only a month before the shooting, and was attempting to regain custody of her son. According to his grandmother, Joseph was a volatile and violent child. He had been expelled from several schools for attacking students and staff, once nearly choking a teacher with a phone cord. She said he had no understanding of cause and effect. Joseph also had developmental disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and low average intelligence. Joseph and his sisters had been educated at home by their parents under the guidance of River Springs Charter School. Hall's neo-Nazi activity For three years, 32-year-old Hall had been having difficulty finding work because of the economic downturn in the construction industry. Due to his perception that Jews and other non-whites were responsible for a thinning job market, he became a local leader in the Neo-Nazi movement. In October 2009, Hall led a group from the National Socialist Movement (NSM) in a rally near a day-laborer site in Riverside. They wore World War II-era Nazi garb. In a November 2009 interview about the rallies in Riverside, Arizona, and Minnesota, Hall said, \\"They're proud of who they are, tired of white guilt being shoved on their kids and multiculturalism. They can't see any reason for it.\\" In 2010, he ran for election against an incumbent for the Western Municipal Water District board as a white supremacist, and he received about a third of the vote. In March 2011, Hall and his group of about two dozen white supremacists took to the streets in the affluent, primarily residential Claremont, Los Angeles County, sometimes called \\"The City of Trees and Ph.D.s\\". They had a screaming confrontation with counter-protesters of more than 200 immigrant rights activists, who decried the group as racist. Hall said, \\"We patrol the borders, we see the devastation, we see the drugs, we know the reality.\\" Dozens of officers from several police agencies were on hand. Just 12 hours before Hall's death, a reporter from The New York Times was in Hall's home, interviewing him and members of his group. She also spoke to the ten-year-old, who showed off a leather belt bearing a silver insignia of the Nazi SS that his father had given him. Death Hall bragged that he was teaching his eldest son Joseph to use night-vision equipment and to shoot a gun. Eventually, the ten-year-old child told police how he took a .357 revolver from a shelf in the closet, pulled the hammer back, aimed the gun at his father's ear while he was asleep on the couch, and shot him. Joseph told police, that the day before the shooting, his father had threatened to remove all the smoke detectors and burn the house down, while the family slept. Joseph admitted that he was tired of his dad hitting him and his mother. His 26-year-old stepmother, Krista, also said that Hall had been violent with her and the son, sometimes losing control and kicking his son in the back. He punished his children in varying extremes on a daily basis. The police report said that the house was filthy, with the floor littered with clothes, and the odor of urine. Many weapons were accessible to the children. The son was arrested and taken to juvenile hall, while the other four children were taken into protective custody. Krista was later arrested and charged with criminal storage of firearms and child neglect. Joann Patterson, Hall's mother and Joseph's grandmother, was given temporary custody of the other four children. On a 60 Minutes interview, she said that her grandson had been misbehaving by starting fires. She was not surprised that he killed his father, but she had expected it would not happen until her grandson was older. The son stated his motivation for the killing was an episode of Criminal Minds, where he claimed he saw a kid shoot his abusive father and did not face any consequences for it. He also believed his father would recover from being shot and that the two of them could reconcile. Prosecution of son Joseph‚Äôs attorneys first moved to seek a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted at the time, he could not have been incarcerated past the age of 25. On January 14, 2013, BBC News reported that the younger Hall, despite his age at the time of the murder, had been found responsible for Jeff Hall's death and could be sent to a juvenile detention facility. His sentencing hearing began on April 15, with his lawyers presenting evidence about his psychological well-being. Joseph was sentenced to juvenile detention until he reaches the age of 23. He is eligible for parole at age 20. He has appealed the conviction and sentence. On Friday, October 16, 2015, the California Supreme Court declined to take Joseph's case, letting stand a ruling that a 10 year old should be able to understand his Miranda rights. On October 3, 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. In popular culture Hall's murder was featured in an episode of Killer Kids.

It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, and of the Archbishop of Indianapolis, most recently Archbishop Charles C. Thompson. Silas Chatard, the first Bishop of Indianapolis, established the cathedral parish in 1892, and named it after Saint Peter and Saint Paul, two apostles of Christ. The cathedral parish became known for its liturgical celebrations and sacred music performances. The architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell, W. L. Coulter of New York designed the Classical Revival-style cathedral, adjacent chapel, and bishop's residence (rectory). The cathedral complex was built in stages. The rectory and chapel were completed in 1892. The cathedral and a temporary facade were built between 1905 and 1907; the permanent facade was erected in 1936. The high altar of the unfinished cathedral was consecrated on December 21, 1906. William Whetten Renwick, nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., was responsible for the cathedral project and designed its original interior decoration. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son was local supervisor for construction of the chapel, rectory, and cathedral, and also designed some of the interior furnishings. August Bohlen supervised construction of the permanent facade. History =Cathedral parish= Window depicting St. Peter The Saints Peter and Paul Parish dates to 1892, when Silas Chatard, fifth Bishop of Vincennes, formally established the new parish in a residential neighborhood north of downtown Indianapolis. In the early 1870s Bishop Jacques Maurice de St. Palais considered Indianapolis as the new seat of the Diocese of Vincennes, but deferred the decision to Bishop Chatard, his successor. Immediately after Chatard's consecration as Bishop of Vincennes on May 12, 1878, he established his residence in Indianapolis at Saint John the Evangelist Church, which served as the pro-cathedral for the diocese in Indianapolis from 1878 to 1906, when Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built. Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral at Vincennes, Indiana, remained the official cathedral church for the diocese until 1898, when the episcopal see was transferred to Indianapolis and became the Diocese of Indianapolis.Kennedy, p. 90. The parish cathedral complex was completed in phases. On August 16, 1890, Bishop Chatard purchased five lots at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets for $32,500, and paid for the property within three years from private donations. Construction for a chapel and rectory began in 1891 and was completed the following year. Anticipating the episcopal see's relocation from Vincennes to Indianapolis, Bishop Chatard purchased five more lots at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets for $22,000 in July 1894 to allow additional space for the cathedral. Four years later, on March 28, 1898, Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the seat of the Diocese of Vincennes to Indianapolis. Saints Peter and Paul became the cathedral parish for the diocese. The parish is known for its liturgical celebrations and sacred music. =Chapel and rectory= Construction of the parish chapel and rectory began on July 15, 1891. The chapel was dedicated on March 25, 1892; Bishop Chatard and Monsignor Auguste Bessonies moved into the rectory on April 18, 1892.Divita, pp. 32-33. In 1907 the chapel underwent a major renovation, but World War I delayed its completion until 1918. Bishop Chatard consecrated the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, as it was named after the renovation, on September 7, 1918.Divita, pp. 42-43. =Cathedral design and construction= Window depicting St. Paul Following the transfer of the diocese to Indianapolis in 1898, Bishop Chatard proceeded with plans to raise funds for a new cathedral. Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built between 1905 and 1907 with a temporary facade. Construction of a permanent facade and twin spires was postponed due to a shortage of funds. Bishop Joseph Ritter arranged for completion of the cathedral in 1936, when the permanent facade was erected. Major renovations and additions, including those made in 1915, 1936, and 1985, have altered the appearance of the cathedral's interior.Divita, p. 35-39, 48-50, and 55. The architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell, W. L. Coulter of New York designed the Classical Revival-style cathedral, rectory, and adjacent chapel. It is believed that the cathedral is patterned after Saint John Lateran in Rome, Italy. (Bishop Chatard was ordained a priest at Saint John Lateran, which holds relics of Saints Peter and Paul.)Divita, p. 31. The original plan for the cathedral at Indianapolis was revised, most likely to reduce its construction costs. Modifications to the plan reduced the overall length and width of the cathedral and eliminated its domes and two side chapels. William Whetten Renwick, nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., took over sole responsibility for the cathedral around 1900, a few years after James's death.Divita, p. 35-37. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son served as local supervisors for the construction project. William Renwick designed the cathedral's original interior d√©cor, including three sanctuary altars, doorway and arch decoration, the metal ceiling, and frames for the Stations of the Cross. D. A. Bohlen and Son designed the interior's original holy water fonts and dark oak furnishings. The high altar of the unfinished cathedral was consecrated on December 21, 1906, in a private ceremony, and the first Pontifical High Mass at the new cathedral took place on December 25, 1906.Divita, p. 32 and 38. Indianapolis architect August Bohlen, grandson of D. A. Bohlen, supervised construction of the permanent fa√ßade in 1936. It was designed by Layton (Dick) DeMilt of the Bohlen architectural firm.Divita, pp. 48-51.Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 333 and 1215. In 1985 Sovik Mathre Sathrum Quanbeck of Northfield, Minnesota, served as project architects and planners for a controversial renovation of the cathedral based on liturgical changes made at the Second Vatican Council. The project had a $1.7 million budget. The refurbished cathedral was rededicated on May 14, 1986.Divita, pp. 58-61. Description Detail of the Great Seal of the United States The cathedral is the main structure in a complex that also includes a three-story rectory, a two-story service wing, and an adjacent chapel. =Exterior and plan= The plan for the cathedral measures by . Its walls and temporary facade were constructed of brick with limestone trim from Bedford, Indiana. The permanent facade is a Roman classical design in the Corinthian order. It includes four fluted columns measuring tall and in diameter, with capitals high and across. The facade has three portals. A U.S. coat of arms is over the north door; the seal of Indiana over the south door; and symbols of the Catholic Church (a ship, Christogram, labarum, and a Latin verse from I Timothy 3:15) over the middle door. The facade also includes two niches intended for statues of Saints Peter and Paul. =Interior= Interior Organ loft Several major renovations have altered the cathedral's interior decoration. The original interior had tinted walls with ivory accents, and the heads of angels topped the panes between its windows. Side altars were installed in 1908. The original dark oak furnishings, which included pews, pulpit, confessional, confessional rails, a bishop's throne and canopy, sedilia, choir stalls, and vestment case, have been removed or replaced. Edgar S. Cameron of Chicago originally painted the upper apse in an early Byzantine style with Christ at the center, flanked by Mary (mother of Jesus) and Saint Peter on the left and Saint Joseph and Saint Paul on the right. In 1936 Cameron's murals were covered with glass mosaics that depicted Christ in Majesty, flanked by Saints Peter and Paul. The original terrazzo flooring, divided with light purple bands, and the marble high altar were replaced in a subsequent renovation.Divita, pp. 37-42 and 51-54. Bishop Chatard commissioned Cesare Aureli, a Roman sculptor, to carve the Blessed Mother and Child statue and the Saint Joseph statue in white Carrara marble. They were installed around 1909. Aureli's statue of Saint Frances de Sales (Bishop Chatard's patron saint) was delivered in 1911, and installed on the high altar. In 1915 a life-size Crucifixion was installed above the main altar.Divita, pp. 37-39 and 59. The sanctuary also includes a copy of Antonio Montauti's Piet√†. Art- glass windows, which were initially installed in 1906, were replaced in the late 1920s, or early 1930s. The Rambusch Decorating Company of New York designed twenty-one new stained-glass windows that included depictions of Saints Peter and Paul; the coats of arms of Bishop Chatard, Bishop Joseph Chartrand, Pope Pius X, and Pope Pius XI; symbols of the Four Evangelists; and wheat and grapes to symbolize the Eucharist. The fa√ßade window in the organ gallery depicted Christ the King and Bishop Ritter's coat of arms.Divita, p. 37 and 50-51. In a sanctuary renovation made in 1936 the floor was extended over the original stairway and covered in marble, the cathedrals walls were faced with marble, and a new baptistry was installed. The renovation also redesigned William Renwick's original Stations of the Cross. The cathedral's organ, originally installed in 1907, was rebuilt as a part of the interior renovation.Divita, p. 39 and 51-54. In 1940 a Madonna of the Forest painting, attributed to fifteenth-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, was presented as a gift to the church. The painting was restored and removed for safekeeping in 1974.Divita, pp. 54-55. Significant renovations made in 1985 and 1986 included a major redecoration of the sanctuary and structural repairs to the exterior and interior. Changes to the sanctuary included relocation of some of its statuary; a new color scheme, flooring, and lighting; removal of the original pews; addition of a white oak, marble-topped altar; replacement of the marble bishop's throne with a white oak chair; and a new lectern to replace the massive marble pulpit. =Rectory= The main entrance from Meridian Street opens into a wide interior corridor. The first floor's original plan had double parlors on the north, a reception room and bishop's study on the south, and a dining rom at the end of the corridor in the building's service area. The second floor included the bishop's quarters on the west and bedrooms on the north and east sides. The third floor, which was later remodeled into sleeping rooms, included four storage rooms with a large library at the center. = Blessed Sacrament Chapel = Blessed Sacrament Chapel The chapel, which measures 80 feet by 34 feet, has a main entrance flanked by double columns that support an arched roof. The interior, which underwent a major renovation in 1918, is decorated in Venetian mosaics. Bernard Mellerio painted the walls with eleven Fra Angelico-style angels based on the originals in San Marco, Florence. Art-glass designs once included the Sacred Heart flanked by angels, the Blessed Sacrament, and a Christogram. With the exception of the Sacred Heart window, they were replaced in 1923 with new designs that depicted, among others, the Last Supper, Christ and his disciples, Emmaus, Monstrance, and angels. Membership Parish membership reached a total of 4,950 in 1928, but it steadily declined after a peak of 4,684 members in 1949. Membership fell to 3,000 by 1960; 1,500 by 1970; and 289 by 1984.Divita, p. 43 and 55-56. As of 2015 parish membership includes 165 families. The decline in membership has been attributed to the deaths of longtime members, parish families moving to the suburbs, a declining neighborhood around the cathedral, and a general urban decline. In an effort to revitalize the cathedral parish, the cathedral complex underwent a major renovation in 1985 and 1986.Divita, pp. 55-56 and 59-61. Ordinations Bishop Joseph Chartrand, the second Bishop of Indianapolis, was ordained a priest in the Saints Peter and Paul chapel on September 24, 1892. He was appointed as rector of the cathedral on December 26, 1905, and named coadjutor bishop and Bishop Chatard's successor on June 27, 1910. Chartrand governed the diocese on the bishop's behalf until Chatard's death on September 7, 1918. Chartrand was consecrated as Bishop of Indianapolis at the cathedral on September 15, 1910.Kennedy, p. 27 and 39.Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 406. Joseph Elmer Ritter, the first Archbishop of Indianapolis, was named rector of the cathedral on August 25, 1925. He was consecrated auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Indianapolis at the cathedral in 1933, and was appointed Bishop of Indianapolis on March 26, 1934.Diocesan Centennial, p. 27. When the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese on November 17, 1944, Ritter became its archbishop.In 1946 Archbishop Ritter moved to Saint Louis, Missouri. Archbishop Ritter was elevated to the College of Cardinals on January 16, 1961. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 1197. Bishops Chatard and Chartrand were initially buried in the cathedral's crypt. In 1976 their remains were removed and interred at the Calvary Cemetery's mausoleum chapel in Indianapolis.Divita, p. 56.

Resort fees originated in North America. Though mostly found in tourist destinations in the United States, some resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean now also charge resort fees. A handful of hotels in Canada have also recently taken up the practice. In many countries, it is illegal to charge additional fees not disclosed at the time of booking. In other countries, including the United States, state laws outlaw various forms of deceptive pricing but the laws have not been universally enforced regarding resort fees. These fees are currently being legally challenged in the United States. Predating the practice of levying resort fees, hotels historically charged guests for specific amenities, such as for snacks, drinks, or the use of facilities, and sometimes for parking. United States Practice  In the United States, resort fees have been a contentious practice. Currently, hotel resort fees can be viewed as illegal based on existing state consumer protection laws. Numerous bodies have authority on this issue in the United States, including the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Association of Attorneys General. To date, 50 Attorneys General have opened an investigation into hotel resort fees. Marriott was issued a subpoena on June 6, 2017 by the Attorney General of Washington, DC regarding their non-cooperation in the investigation, as the hospitality industry continues to stall any legislative solution to the issue. In July 2019 the Attorney General of Washington, DC sued Marriott arguing that hotel resort fees violate Washington, DC's Consumer Protection Procedure's Act. In July 2019 the Attorney General of Nebraska sued Hilton arguing that hotel resort fees violate Nebraska's Consumer Protection Act and Nebraska's Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. In September 2019, Congressmembers Eddie Bernie Johnson and Jeff Fortenberry introduced a bill to the U.S. Congress that would end the practice of advertising hotel resort fees separate from the room rate. =Background= In 1997 some resort hotels began to charge a mandatory resort fee, regardless of which facilities were actually used by a guest. Advertising a room without including the resort fee in the price enables the hotel to advertise a lower room rate than the actual price of the room. Resort fees were previously found just in tourist locations at actual resorts but now they are common throughout the United States in exclusive resort destinations and at two star hotels in American cities. The fees are usually seen as a nuisance by travelers. They also affect international tourists who are unfamiliar with the breakdown of a US hotel bill and may not speak English. Resort fees are most commonly charged in tourist areas, where there is collusion, with all hotels deciding to charge such fees. Currently, resort fees apply to almost all 62,000 rooms on the Las Vegas Strip. Resort fees, along with the recent introduction parking charges (neither of which are typically charged at the numerous alternative gaming locations in the United States), are believed to be a major cause of a reduction in tourism to Las Vegas. Resort fees may also be charged by budget hotels. For example, the Days Inn in Miami Beach, the Super 8 in Las Vegas and the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City two-star hotels that charge resort fees. Econo Lodges around Orlando have begun to charge resort fees. New York City has seen a surge in hotel resort fees. In New York City the fees are often called destination fees, facility fees or amenity fees. There were 15 hotels in New York City with resort fees in 2016. In 2018 there were 84. In 2020, there are over 125. =Objections = Consumer advocates describe the fee as paying a second room rate. The average resort fee in 2015 was $24.93 per day. It can be more than the advertised cost of the room. There is no limit to what the resort fee can be. Two hotels in Florida have resort fees of over $100 per day. Many hotels in Las Vegas advertise room rates that are lower than the resort fee, causing the total price to be more than double the advertised price. The practice is widely known as drip pricing, particularly in consumer rights contexts. One price is advertised to attract customers, but when a customer checks in, there are then mandatory fees, taxes, and other charges that incrementally drip beyond the price originally advertised. Resort fees have been criticized by consumers for not being fairly disclosed prior to booking of accommodation. Katherine Lugar, former president and Chief Executive Officer of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, said that ‚Äúthroughout the booking process, hotels are transparent about costs, fees and taxes.‚Äù That assertion has been challenged by consumer advocates. They argue that though hotels may list a resort fee, they do so at the very end of the booking process in extremely small print. Charlie Leocha, President of Travelers United, said, \\"The charging of mandatory resort fees by hotels results in a misrepresentation of the true price of the hotel room.\\" Hotels often try to hide the fee as a tax. A resort fee is not a tax The Arizona Grand Resort & Spa listed its resort fee as a tax. The Life Hotel in New York City lists their fee as an \\"NYC mandatory City Hotel Fee.\\" Consumer advocates have noted that if consumers choose to book their hotel based on price-based search tools on Expedia, Priceline, or Hotel Tonight, the resort fees are left off in the initial price comparison search. A hotel could be anywhere from $10 to $50 more expensive per night, but it is not listed with the advertised price. A Priceline spokeswoman, Flavie Lemarchand-Wood, said the practice of tacking added fees onto the advertised price after a hotel is selected is not deceptive: \\"We are compliant in disclosing the fees prior to purchase. It is very important [for the consumer] to read everything on the page\\" Expedia, Priceline and Hotel Tonight do not take commission from the resort fee. These online booking companies have no incentive to publish the resort fee. The hotel takes the entire amount of the resort fee. These companies are further disincentivized since if one site begins to add the resort fee to the advertised rate, it will look like the price on that site is higher and consumers would go to a competing online booking site. Consumers groups such as Travelers United and Kill Resort Fees contend if a hotel charges a mandatory fee, it should be included the nightly room rate. Hotel rating systems, such as AAA, have taken a policy of deducting points from a hotel being reviewed if they charge resort fees. AAA has said resort fees are a major annoyance of travelers. Frommer's travel guides have come out with numerous articles against hotel resort fees. =Benefit to hotels= The major benefit to the hotels is the profit, while still being able to show 'reasonable' room prices to the public. Resort fees brought in $2.47 billion to the hotel industry in 2015. MGM Resorts International stated that, for Las Vegas hotel rooms in 2011, \\"Our RevPAR (revenue per available room) in the first quarter was up 16%, including resort fees. Excluding resort fees, REVPAR was up 11% in the quarter year-over-year.\\" Online hotel search and booking tools like Expedia, Travelocity and Hotel Tonight take a percentage of a reservation and then pass the reservation on to the hotel. A hotel loses a certain percentage from every reservation made on one of the sites. Hotels that charge resort fees but are listed on these hotel search and booking sites list only their advertised rate and not their resort fee. That is because the hotel booking site takes a percentage of that advertised rate. When the hotel collects the resort fee at check in, separately from the rate purchased for online, the hotel collects 100% of that charge. Resort fees also affect travel agents. Travel agents can earn commission on the advertised rate of the hotel and do not collect a percentage of taxes or fees. Furthermore, travel agencies must legally know what the resort fee for each hotel is so that they can properly pass it on to their clients. Failure to do so could result in a lawsuit to their agency. Individual travel agents have found it difficult to keep up with changing hotel resort fees. The American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) launched an advocacy campaign to support the federal bi- partisan bill to end undisclosed hotel resort fees in October 2019. Hotels also benefit by offering a free room that is not free. Hotels and resorts also often collect resort fees from guests who are paying for their stay with loyalty points, since the resort fee is categorized a mandatory charge for bundled services as opposed to part of the room rate. In gambling locations, rooms are often comped for guests who are frequent gamblers. These hotels may over a \\"comped\\" room but still charge a resort fee so the room is not complimentary at all. =Benefit to consumers= The American Hotel and Lodging Association has stated that the resort fee provides many benefits to consumers. Hotels say that customers like many features and amenities of the hotel to be included in the resort fee to avoid nickel and diming, but there is no proof that any services are included in the fees, which leads many consumers to deem it to be dishonest pricing. MGM Resorts International senior vice president Alan Feldman has said, ‚ÄúWe have heard negative feedback from guests, but we‚Äôve also heard positive feedback, from guests who are happy that they are no longer paying √† la carte for different services. They don‚Äôt feel nickeled and dimed.‚Äù The American Hotel and Lodging Association said that resort fees pay for a range of hotel amenities, such as pool use, gym access, towel services, Wi-Fi, newspapers, shuttle service, daily parking. They state that the resort fee is a payment for a group of services. Consumer advocates such as the National Consumers League and Travelers United have stated that since it is a mandatory fee, it is not an exchange of service. A guest could decline all of the services allegedly offered by the resort fee and still be forced to pay the resort fee. The advocates state that there is no exchange of service. It is simply an additional amount that the hotel collects, on top of the advertised room rate. Most hotels tax the resort fee at the hotel occupancy tax rate. This is a tax rate reserved for hotel room rates. Services are taxed at the sales tax rate in the United States. The hotel occupancy tax is higher than the sales tax rate. Consumer advocates argue this shows that the hotel resort fee is considered part of the room rate for the hotel and for tax purposes, not an exchange of service. A direct exchange of service, such as a hotel charge of bringing an extra bed to the room, would always be taxed at sales tax. A resort fee is normally not taxed as an exchange of service, but as a second room rate. = Taxes = Since resort fees are not included in the advertised room rates, the fee can be taxed differently from the regular room rates. Resort fees in Nevada are treated and taxed as a hotel room at hotel occupancy tax. Both hotel rooms and resort fees in Nevada are taxed at 13.38%. Resort fees at many hotels in New York are taxed at 8.875% instead of the hotel occupancy tax of 14.75%. There is a 5.875% tax loss for New York City per resort fee per room per night. Consumer advocates estimate that hotel resort fees in New York City cause $10 million of lost tax revenue annually. = Federal Trade Commission = The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the US government organization with authority to regulate the hotel industry. On the subject of resort fees in 2012, FTC attorney Mamie Kresses said \\"The fees are not illegal as long as they're disclosed.\\" What constitutes a clear disclosure, however, has been a matter of debate between the hotel industry and consumers. In 2012, FTC advised 22 hotel operators that their online rate quote totals, which did not include certain fees, may need to be updated to comply with FTC regulations. Since then the FTC has taken no legal action on resort fees. Consumer advocate Chris Elliott wrote \\"The FTC has failed to protect consumers from what is perhaps the most dishonest fee in the travel industry.\\" In 2016, FTC Chairperson Ramirez wrote a letter to Congress on the subject of resort fees and said ‚Äúin my view‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the most efficient and effective means to mandate the type of industry-wide requirement you propose would be through legislation.‚Äù US Senator McCaskill introduced the ‚ÄúTruth in Hotel Advertising Act of 2016‚Äù in the US Senate on February 25, 2016. The purpose of the bill is to \\"prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising of hotel room rates, and for other purposes.\\" The bill was not voted on during the 114th Congress. FTC published a report on the harm of resort fees on January 5, 2017, which concluded \\"that consumers are likely being harmed by the hotel industry practice of disclosing mandatory resort fees separate from posted room rates, without first disclosing the total price.\\" A new bill was introduced by Congressmembers Eddie Bernice Johnson and Jeff Fortenberry to the US House of Representatives on September 25, 2019. =Challenges to resort fees= Many consumers have begun to challenge resort fees. This has been done by asking the hotel desk manager to remove the fee, by disputing the fee with the guest's credit card company or by suing the hotel in small claims court. Consumer travel advocate Christopher Elliott advises anyone who was blindsided by an add-on fee to dispute the charge with their credit card company. While the booking sites may allow small-print disclosures, some credit card companies have taken the consumer's side in these disputes and reversed the charges. Moreover, merchants that have a high volume of disputed charges can run afoul of credit card providers, which in egregious cases have the ability to terminate a vendor's right to accept credit cards. Kill Resort Fees, an advocacy group working to eliminate resort fees, stated that all resort fees should be challenged. Lauren Wolfe, founder of Kill Resort Fees, said that \\"Resort fees are the equivalent of being charged a second room rate. No law exists protecting hotels ability to charge two room rates for one night so all of these second rates also known as resort fees should be challenged by consumers.\\" Wolfe advocates that consumers should file a consumer complaint with their Attorney General to have their AG force the hotel to refund the customer. = Legal action in the United States = Fifty Attorneys General began an investigation into the practice of hotel resort fees in May 2016. Marriott resisted turning over documents on the investigation after many requests by the Attorneys General. Marriott was subpoenaed on June 7, 2017 by the District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine. The subpoena reads: > \\"D.C. Code 1-301.89c(a) provides that the Office of the Attorney General > 'shall have the authority to issue subpoenas for the production of documents > and materials or for the attendance and testimony of witnesses under oath, > or both, related to an investigation into unfair, deceptive, unconscionable, > or fraudulent trade practices by or between a merchant or consumer, as > defined in 28-3901.' Consistent with that authority, on May 16, 2016, the > District served its subpoena on Marriott\\" Wyndham is currently facing a class action lawsuit in Pennsylvania Federal Court regarding hotel resort fees. Luca v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. et al., case number 2:16-cv-00746, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania deals with and Wyndham its subsidiaries are sneaking a resort fee on to its room prices without notifying consumers, causing its rooms to be advertised at deceptively low rates, according to a proposed class action filed Monday in Pennsylvania federal court. The case reads: > ‚ÄúDefendants‚Äô failure to adequately disclose the resort fee charge as part of > the true cost of renting a hotel room is deceptive and causes consumers, > including plaintiff and the class, to believe that they are paying > substantially less than they actually are being charged for a room at > defendants‚Äô hotels,‚Äù according to the complaint.\\" Most hotels that have resort fees say the fee provides internet access. In most locations, the hotel resort fee is taxed sales tax or hotel occupancy tax. Some have argued that internet access cannot be taxed at either of these tax rates due to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. New York State is explicit in saying hotels and motels cannot tax internet access. Numerous hotels are being sued over their claim that resort fees provide internet access. = Organizations advocating for the ability of hotels to charge resort fees = * American Hotel and Lodging Association * American Gaming Association = Organizations advocating against resort fees= * Kill Resort Fees * Travelers United * National Consumers League * Consumer Reports * Consumer Federation of America Countries where resort fees are illegal =Australia= In Australia, under the Australian Consumer Law, the advertised or quoted price for all consumer goods and services must be a single amount inclusive of all mandatory fees, including resort fees, as well as any tax, duty, fee, levy or other additional charges.\\" Deliberately doing otherwise are grounds for prosecution for misleading and unconscionable conduct. Additionally, under Australia‚Äôs anti-price drip laws, it is also not sufficient, and it is illegal, to add a mandatory fee (including resort fees) in circumstances where it was only disclosed and added to the final single figure in the late stages of a booking process. This price-dripping practice constitutes a bait and switch tactic which is misleading and detrimental to both consumers and competitors. All mandatory fees must be disclosed early on in the booking process. In order to protect Australian consumers, heavy penalties are applied and enforced (up to hundreds of thousands of dollars) for each instance of a breach of the Australian consumer laws. =Europe= In the European Economic Area, which comprises the European Union plus three more countries, Articles 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(e) of Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights Directive) require businesses to quote \\"the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes\\". Therefore, it is unlawful to charge or advertise unavoidable fees and taxes that are not included within the total room rate, such as resort fees and city taxes. The legislation also applies when booking non-EEA accommodation via EEA-based travel agents and web sites, which are bound by the same requirement to quote the \\"total price\\".

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Comal County, Texas in 1970, and designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1936. The house is currently owned and run as a museum by the New Braunfels Conservation Society. Ferdinand Lindheimer Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer (1801‚Äì1879) was known as the father of Texas Botany. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Lindheimer emigrated to the United States in 1834 to escape persecution resulting from his political activities. After military participation in Texas, Lindheimer moved to St. Louis, Missouri to partner in botanical research with George Engelmann and Asa Gray. His research brought him in touch with John O. Meusebach, after which Lindheimer moved back to Texas where he spent the rest of his life. Saltbox house Lindheimer built his timber-framed house in 1852, in the saltbox style, with the roof at the back of his house sloping lower than the roof at the front of the house. Stucco covers the fachwerk totally on three sides of Lindheimer's house, but leaves it exposed in the back. A popular architecture style in New England, the saltbox house was also utilized among German immigrants in Texas. Rather than a full second story, Lindheimer's house has a loft as the second story. A centralized chimney heats the home. The front of the house has two transomed, paneled doors.

Retrieved 27 September 2011. His ashes were scattered from the top of Shepherd's Crag, Borrowdale. Ornithology From 1903 to 1914 Beetham devoted much time to his passion for ornithology. Amongst his expeditions, always undertaken with a camera in hand, were trips to the coast in the north-east of England, where he developed a technique for photographing gannets that involved abseiling down cliffs with the rope attached to a stake that was driven into the ground at the top of the cliff. Beetham at this time used a cumbersome and heavy Sanderson half-plate field camera. Rock climbing and mountaineering Beetham started rock climbing in the English Lake District, although his re-ascents of the sea-cliffs on the north-east coast, once he had captured images of birds on photographic plates, involved much use of the hands. In the Lakes he used Wasdale Head as a base and commenced a friendship with Howard Somervell. Together they made ascents of the classic Lakeland climbs in the period before the First World War. After the war, Beetham and Somervell started climbing in the Alps, initially under the supervision of the 60-year-old Godfrey Solly in Chamonix, and subsequently on their own and without guides. In 1924, Beetham, along with Somervell (who had already been on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition), was chosen by the Mount Everest Committee to be a member of the ill-fated 1924 British Mount Everest expedition, on which Mallory and Irvine were killed. Beetham suffered from dysentery and sciatica and never made it high on the mountain.\\"Bentley Beetham\\", rgs.org.

Graham had been a conscientious objector during the First World War, which became the basis of a whispering campaign by Beetham, even though Beetham had not fought himself.Wade Davis, Into the Silence, Vintage, 2012, pp. 473‚Äì4. By contrast, Captain John Noel wrote: It was during this expedition that Beetham took his highly regarded photographs of Tibet. Beetham made numerous expeditions to other ranges in the world, including the Tatra Mountains of Czechoslovakia, Chile, the Drakensberg, the Lofoten islands and Spitsbergen. He is most associated with the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, which he visited on five separate occasions. His first visit was in 1927, together with G. Thompson, during which he made the first British ascents of many peaks in the Toubkal region.Robin G.

Beetham was responsible for developing the most popular crag in the valley, Shepherd's Crag, which lies just above the main road that runs beside Derwentwater.

It has only one species, Myanmymar aresconoides. It is dated to the Cenomanian, at around a hundred million years ago. As of 2011, it is the oldest known fossil mymarid. Discovery and geologic time range Myanmymar aresconoides was described by John T. Huber and George Poinar, Jr. from a specimen of a female embedded in Burmese amber. The amber was recovered in 2001 from the Noije Bum 2001 Summit Site, a fossil amber mine in Hukawng Valley, Kachin State of Myanmar. The site is dated to the Upper Albian (97 to 110 million years ago) of the Early Cretaceous epoch. As of 2011, this makes Myanmymar aresconoides the oldest known fossil mymarid recovered. Taxonomy Myanmymar aresconoides is the only species belonging to the genus Myanmymar. It belongs to the family of fairyflies Mymaridae of the chalcid wasp superfamily Chalcidoidea. The generic name Myanmymar is derived from a euphonious combination of \\"Myanmar\\" and Greek Œº·ø∂ŒºŒøœÇ (m≈çmos, \\"spot\\" or \\"blot\\"). The specific name means \\"resembling Arescon\\", from Arescon (an extant genus of fairyfly) and Greek -Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ (eidos, \\"like\\", \\"resembling\\"). Description Possible male specimen of the M. aresconoides Like other fairyflies, M. aresconoides is a tiny wasp. The entire body length of the specimen is about half a millimeter, . The head measures about and have moderately sized eyes. The antennae have eight segments in the funicle and two on club-like tip (clava). The maxillary palps have three segments. The mesosoma (middle part of the body) is long. It has narrow forewings, with wing venation extending up to two-thirds of the length and a rounded lobe at the base. On the margins are numerous long bristle-like projections (marginal setae), the longest of which is about twice the greatest width of the wing. The hindwings are also narrow with parallel sides. Their marginal setae are about seven times the width of the wing. Both wings do not possess microtrichia (small irregularly scattered hairs), except for two sparse rows beyond the venation of the forewings. The legs have long tarsi with five segments. The tibia is not clearly visible but is assumed to be about the same length as the tarsi. The metasoma is longer than the mesosoma, at . The ovipositor is long, with the sheath slightly extending over the tip of the metasoma. As the specific name suggests, M. aresconoides is very similar to the extant genus Arescon in wing shape and venation. Only three other modern mymarid genera (Boudiennyia, Eustochomorpha, and Borneomymar) share all the M. aresconoides characteristics of having forewing venation longer than half the wing length, five segments on the tarsi, and eight segments on the funicles. M. aresconoides is also unique among fairyflies in having three distinct segments on the palpi. In contrast, all modern mymarids have unsegmented palpi. Another specimen of a possible male of the species was also discovered. It is long, with a head wide. However, it is impossible to ascertain if they belong to the same species due to the poor condition of the second specimen.

The trail and surrounding area became listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2009 and is being explored as an addition to the National Historic Trails System upon signing of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009. History The Butterfield Overland Mail route was a stagecoach route chosen to be snow-free unlike the more northern but shorter routes in place at the time. It ran from St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California beginning in 1858. Fayetteville was located between the major stops at Tipton, Missouri and Fort Smith, Arkansas and the city grew significantly during the trail's operation. This segment overlapped a formerly well-traveled Native American removal route from Springfield, Missouri to Fayetteville from the 1830s. John Butterfield built a hotel and several barns in Fayetteville for his travelers to utilize before continuing north to Fitzgerald Station in Shiloh, Mudtown, Cross Hollows, Callahan's tavern and Missouri. Preservation The 3000 block of Old Wire Road (Arkansas Highway 265) in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Today, the route has been partially preserved as Arkansas Highway 265 in Northwest Arkansas and (partially) as Old Wire Road in Fayetteville. The route is designated with historic markers through Fayetteville, including an original stone along present-day College Avenue (U.S. Route 71B) in front of the Former Washington County Courthouse. This NRPH segment is not designated AR 265 and runs through Lake Fayetteville Park as a dirt path. In south Washington County, Arkansas another NRHP-listed segment exists along Bugscuffle Road. A study to include the Butterfield Trail as a National Historic Trail was commissioned in the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 upon the request of Representative John Bozeman as a nationally significant piece of history of trade and commerce in America.

Both countries established diplomatic relation in 1993 following Eritrean independence. Eritrea has an embassy in the Twin Towers, Ramat Gan and Israel has an embassy in Asmara. Israeli-Eritrean ties are complicated by Israel's close ties to Ethiopia, who have shared an unfriendly dyad with Eritrea for a long time. Nevertheless, their ties are generally considered as close. Eritrean War of Independence During the end of the Eritrean War of Independence, Israel provided support to Ethiopia. This was because it saw the Eritrean conflict as an extension of the wider Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. The majority of Arab countries supported Eritrea's separation from Ethiopia. They saw its sizeable Muslim population (45%) as a way to make sure the Red Sea remained \\"Arab Waters\\". For this reason Israel allied itself with the Ethiopian government to take advantage of the long Eritrean coast which stretches over 1,080 kilometres. This began in the early 1960s when Israel started helping the Ethiopian government in its campaigns against the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The Ethiopian government portrayed the Eritrean rebellion as an Arab threat to the African region, an argument that convinced the Israelis to side with the Ethiopian government in the conflict. Israel trained counter-insurgency forces in order to counter the armed struggle of the ELF. Israel considered the Eritrean liberation struggle as supported by Arab states and feared that a pro-Arab independent Eritrea would block Israeli passage through the Red Sea. As the war developed, Israeli assistance to the Ethiopian government was increased. By 1966, there were around 100 Israeli military advisors in Ethiopia. By 1967, troops trained by Israeli advisors had taken control over much of Eritrea. By the late 1970s, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) had become the main rebel group in Eritrea after defeating the ELF. After another decade of war, in May 1991 the Ethiopian government was overthrown by the EPLF rebel group (Eritrea) and replaced by a Pro-Eritrea Government in that time (TPLF). EPLF rebel group established Eritrea's independence and made Ethiopia a landlocked country. Today both Eritrea and Israel share similarity in military and invasion history. Post- independence A strategic relationship between the new government of Eritrea and Israel was formed when Eritrea's President Isaias Afewerki travelled to Israel for medical treatment in 1993.Eritrea-Israel relations Afewerki was transferred to Israel by an American airplane. The US representative in the Eritrean capital Asmara suggested the idea after the Eritrean leader fell ill. These happenings along with American efforts led to the opening of an Israeli Embassy in Asmara on March 15, 1993, prior to the official announcement on April 27, 1993. There are allegations by Arab states of military and intelligence ties including claims that Israel aided Eritrea during the Hanish Islands conflict against Yemen (a country which does not recognize Israel), however there is no clear evidence. Additionally, the Eritrean government does not recognize Palestine.https://web.archive.org/web/20110928101735/http://www.mfa.gov.et/Press_Section/Week_Horn_Africa_October_15_2010.htm As of March 2020, there are 21,929 Eritreans living in Israel.

Mission The Mission statement is: To Develop a Skilled and Empowered Legal Profession in Execution of its Statutory Mandate to Foster and Improve Access to and Administration of Justice as well as Good Governance in Uganda. The ULS Vision is: To be a Proficient Bar Association in Fostering Access to Justice, the Rule of Law and Good Governance in Uganda. Objectives The Strategic Goal of the Uganda Law Society is: Efficient Legal Service Delivery to ensure Access to Justice and Observance of the Rule of Law for Positive Social Transformation. The Strategic Objectives of the Uganda Law Society are: To promote members‚Äô professional development and ethical conduct; To promote access to justice for Indigent, marginalized and vulnerable persons in Uganda; To contribute to upholding and promoting the rule of law in Uganda; To strengthen the institutional capacity of the ULS to become a modern Bar Association. The Uganda Law Society was formed by an act of Parliament in 1956. The ULS is governed by an executive council with representatives from each of the four regions of Uganda. It is a member of the East Africa Law Society, which also includes member countries Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. Projects ;Legal Aid Project (LAP) The Legal Aid Project (LAP) was established by the Uganda Law Society in 1992, with assistance from the Norwegian Bar Association, to provide legal assistance to indigent and vulnerable people in Uganda. The Project was born out of the realization that apart from the state brief system that handles only capital offences, and the huge backlog of cases, there is no statutory free legal aid provision in Uganda despite the fact that a large part of Uganda's population lives below the poverty line, and without means to access justice. To date, the project has helped and continues to help thousands of indigent men, women and children to realize their legal and human rights. LAP has branches in Kabarole, Kabale, Masindi, Jinja, Gulu, Arua, Soroti, Mbarara, Moroto and its head office in Kampala. ;The Pro-Bono Project Pro-bono services in Uganda are premised on the fact that a significant proportion of the Ugandan population lives in abject poverty. This leads to limited access to justice as they cannot pursue the same due to the high related costs. According to the National Development Plan, the Justice, Law and Order Sector (JLOS) notes that the key barriers to access to justice include: growing caseloads, physical distance to service institutions, technical barriers, poverty, and lack of access by women and marginalized groups. It further indicates that women experience more barriers in accessing justice because they have higher illiteracy levels and lack information about legal rights. To this end, prevailing poverty and its attendant restriction on mobility limits access to legal services and as such occasions injustice. The Pro-bono Scheme of the Uganda Law Society was initiated as a pilot project by the Uganda Law Society in partnership with the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, (Law Council) supported by the Legal Aid Basket Fund (LABF) in 2008. The Project currently covers the districts of Kampala, Gulu, Jinja, Kabale, Kabarole, Masindi, Soroti, Arua and Mbarara through the satellite clinics of the Legal Aid Project (LAP) of the Uganda Law Society. ;Democratic Governance for Development (DGD) Project This partnership between Avocats Sans Fronti√®res (ASF) and Uganda Law Society (ULS) focuses on Mobilizing Lawyers for the Rights of Ugandans.

Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) is a radio interferometer funded by the National Science Foundation to detect 21 cm hydrogen (HI) fluctuations occurring when the first galaxies ionized intergalactic gas at around 500 Million years after the Big Bang. PAPER is a focused experiment aimed toward making the first statistical detection of the 21 cm reionization signal. Given the stringent dynamic range requirements for detecting reionization in the face of foregrounds that are five orders of magnitude brighter, the PAPER project is taking a carefully staged engineering approach, optimizing each component in the array to mitigate, at the outset, any potentially debilitating problems in subsequent data calibration and analysis. This staged approach addresses the observational challenges that arise from very-wide-field, high-dynamic-range imaging over wide bandwidths in the presence of transient terrestrial interference. PAPER began as a collaboration between Don Backer of the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory and Richard Bradley of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. With Backer's passing in 2010, Aaron Parsons has assumed leadership of PAPER on the side of UC Berkeley. The two fundamental concerns that most influence the design of any HI reionization detection instrument are removing foregrounds and achieving the requisite sensitivity. The PAPER approach heavily emphasizes the former; the level of instrumental calibration and foreground characterization that will be required to model and remove polarized galactic synchrotron emission, continuum point-sources, and galactic/extra-galactic free-free emission is unprecedented in the 100-200 MHz band expected to encompass reionization. PAPER consists of two distinct arrays: one located at the NRAO site in Green Bank, WV, which is used primarily for engineering investigations and field testing, and another located at the South African SKA site in the Karoo desert of the Northern Cape, South Africa., which is used for science observations. PAPER in Green Bank, West Virginia, USA PAPER in Green Bank has evolved over a few years from exploring basic systematics in a rudimentary four-element array to the more comprehensive system performance testing with the thirty-two element array that is currently deployed there. PAPER activities at the NRAO site near Green Bank, WV began in 2005 with the deployment of a 4-antenna, single- polarization interferometer. After substantial testing and improvement of the PAPER design, we deployed eight antennas in a nearby field in April, 2008. This new system incorporated antenna elements with ground-screen flaps and a digital correlator based on CASPER hardware. PAPER in South Africa The South African array is aimed toward realizing our primary science objective: detecting reionization. The instrument is located at the P2 site on the Square Kilometer Array South Africa (SKA-SA) reserve near the small town of Carnarvon. Deployments at the SKA-South Africa site in the Karoo desert began with ground breaking and the deployment of 16 antennas in October 2009, continued with an increase to 32 antennas in April 2010, followed by commissioning and observing in May 2010. The array was expanded again in July 2011 to 64 elements. An expansion to 128 antennas is planned for 2013. PAPER in the HERA roadmap PAPER, along with the Murchison Widefield Array, are frontier projects within the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) program. The HERA road map for exploring reionization was organized into three sequential phases. Phase I has as its goal the first statistical detection of the HI 21 cm signal from reionization. HERA II entails applying lessons learned during Phase I to define and build a larger array capable of detailed characterization of the statistical signal and imaging the brightest reionization structures. The final stage of HERA, Phase III, will address the challenges of full tomographic imaging using an SKA-scale facility with capabilities informed by the earlier work. The HERA program was the highest ranked of the Decadal Survey RMS Panel scientific recommendations.

He was the first British serviceman to be killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the time of his death he was attached to the Cheshire Regiment as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) during Operation Grapple 1. The following day Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, announced that a Royal Navy task force would be sent to the Adriatic and that any future attacks on British troops could lead to the immediate deployment of artillery and strike aircraft to counter them. This was the first carrier task force to leave British shores on a military operation since the Falklands War 11 years earlier. Early life Edwards was born in Cefn Mawr, near Wrexham, Wales, the son of John Edwards and Barbara Ellis. His father was a British soldier who had served in the Welsh Guards. Edwards joined the Army Cadet Force, a youth organisation with connections to the British Army, aged 13. His stepfather, John Manley, said that Edwards was a popular figure locally, \\"who used to go out of his way to help others. He would be walking along the lane here and see one of the neighbours struggling to lift something, and he would just jump over the hedge and lift it for them. He was that type of lad. Everybody was his friend in the village. Everybody knew 'Eddie' Edwards.\\" At the age of 11, Edwards had acquired an old motorcycle and developed a passion for mechanics. After leaving school at 16 he became a trainee mechanic for a local garage, where he stayed until he was 18 when he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Military career Edwards was promoted to Lance corporal in 1992. After serving two tours of duty with the Army in Northern Ireland, where he had seen one friend killed and another wounded, Edwards deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in November 1992, based in Vitez as the driver of a FV510 Warrior infantry fighting vehicle. The attachment arose when the Cheshires asked for volunteers from other regiments within their division, the Prince of Wales', to train as drivers. His stepfather said \\"He took his army career very seriously. He was so proud to wear that uniform.\\" When told he would be deploying with UNPROFOR \\"he was apprehensive, but looking forward to it. He said: 'It's my job and I've got to do it, so let's get on with it.' That was him, you know?\\" Death FV510 Warrior. The driver's hatch is located on the front left of the vehicle, shown here in the 'open' position. The British contingent of UNPROFOR had come under fire on many occasions since the advance party had arrived in October 1992. Warrior patrols to Turbe, near Travnik, were repeatedly shelled, suffering light damage, and a three-mile stretch north of Kladanj on the road to Tuzla was nicknamed \\"Bomb Alley\\" because of the regular attacks on UN convoys. In the week leading up to Edwards' death, British forces came under attack on two occasions, first when a Serbian artillery barrage hit the Royal Engineers' headquarters at Tomislavgrad, followed by an ambush against a Danish UN relief convoy returning from Tuzla with an escort of British FV107 Scimitar armoured reconnaissance vehicles from the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, forcing the British to return fire with 30mm RARDEN cannons. Edwards' vehicle, commanded by Corporal Alan Furniss, was part of 5 Platoon which operated as the personal escort for Lieutenant Colonel Robert Stewart DSO, the commanding officer of the Cheshires. On 13 January 1993 they escorted him from the British headquarters at Vitez to Gornji Vakuf where he planned to negotiate a ceasefire between the opposing Muslim ARBiH troops and Croat HVO troops. Formerly allied against Serbian forces, they had begun fighting each other the day before. The fighting was blamed on a number of factors, including the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of Muslims from the nearby village of Prozor by HVO forces, troops from outside the area \\"stirring up trouble\\", and dissatisfaction among the 56% Muslim majority in the town with the Geneva peace plan, tentatively agreed a week earlier, which would leave Gornji Vakuf in a Croat-controlled canton. During the negotiations, the British received a request to escort an ambulance carrying three injured civilian women through the town and on to the nearest medical facility. Two Warriors were assigned to protect them, with one positioned at the front of the ambulance and one at the rear. Edwards drove the lead Warrior which left the British base at Gornji Vakuf at 10.30am in the direction of the town centre. Edwards drove with the hatch in the 'open' position for greater visibility. The rear Warrior was also transporting the Regimental Medical Officer, Major Tracy Clarke RAMC. Approximately twelve minutes after leaving the base, as Edwards drove across a bridge, he was struck by a single shot in the head and his Warrior went out of control and mounted the pavement. He was dragged from the vehicle and given first aid while Clarke ran from the rear vehicle to attend him. More Warriors were called from the base and formed a defensive ring as Clarke attempted resuscitation but Edwards had died almost instantly. It is not known who fired the shot. Reactions Prime Minister John Major told the House of Commons: \\"This soldier has lost his life in working to save the lives of many others. No one can make a greater sacrifice. His family have my deepest sympathy in the sorrow they face.\\" On 14 January 1992 Malcolm Rifkind announced that a Royal Navy task force consisting of HMS Ark Royal, HMS Coventry, HMS Brilliant, RFA Argus and RFA Fort Grange would be despatched to the Adriatic. The task force carried eight Harrier jump jets, 17 Sea King helicopters, a battery of six 105mm Light Guns, and a total of approximately 2,340 military personnel, mostly Royal Navy. Mr. Rifkind told a press conference that if British troops faced serious attacks, the 105mm guns would be airlifted into Bosnia by Sea Kings and made ready to respond, and that the task force, which would sit in the Adriatic Sea, could also be used to evacuate British forces if the lives of the soldiers were placed at serious risk. Lt. Col. Stewart demanded that the Croat and Muslim commanders open a murder enquiry and said: \\"This is cold-blooded murder and there will be a murder investigation. Lance Corporal Edwards was a UN soldier, and we want the person responsible brought to trial.\\" On 16 January 1993 Stewart managed to broker a temporary ceasefire in Gornji Vakuf so that a wreath could be laid at the spot where Edwards was killed. At 2.00pm both sides paused hostilities while four Warriors drove to the bridge. Accompanying the British troops at the ceremony were the commanders of the BiH and HVO units. Cpl. Furniss tied a wreath of yellow and red carnations and pine branches, spelling out the name 'Ed', to the bridge. After a minute's silence the BiH and HVO commanders saluted and the British withdrew. Hostilities recommenced minutes later. Edwards' death prompted the Armed Forces Financial Advisory Services to relaunch its 'Forces Safeguard' life insurance policy for members of the Armed Forces on active service. His funeral was held at St. John's Church, Rhosymedre, Wales on 25 January 1993. In May 1993 Edwards' mother attended the parade at the Cheshires' home base in Germany where medals for service were awarded. She was presented with her son's United Nations Medal by Lt. Col. Stewart. In November 2010, Edwards' sister was presented with the Elizabeth Cross, awarded to the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces killed in action after the Second World War. Inquest On 15 June 1993 the jury at Edwards' inquest, held in Wrexham, returned a verdict of unlawful killing. Lt. Col. Stewart said in a statement read to the hearing that he believed the murderer would never be caught, and that \\"Since the incident I have been to a number of meetings of the local commanders of the Muslim and Croatian armies to try and negotiate peace in Gornji Vakuf. During those meetings I have told both sides that the British Army will be treating L/Cpl Edwards' death as murder.\\" John Hughes, the South Clwyd coroner said: \\"This is a terribly tragic case of a young man of 26 who went to serve Queen and country in a peacekeeping capacity, not to fight. He had gone to serve the United Nations in a country torn apart by civil war and has met an untimely death.\\" Legacy On 1 October 2011, as a tribute to him and the other peacekeepers that lost their lives during the conflict, the mayor of Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje renamed the bridge where Edwards was killed to \\"Lance Corporal Wayne Edwards Bridge.\\" The official ceremony was attended by Edwards' sister Kimberley, the British ambassador Nigel Casey, Defence Attache Lt.Col. Stephen Croft and Col. Robert Stewart. In popular culture The 1999 British television drama Warriors, written by Leigh Jackson and directed by Peter Kosminsky, retold British soldiers' experiences during Operation Grapple using real events but with fictional characters. Edwards was renamed Private Peter \\"Skeeter\\" Skeet for the programme and was portrayed by actor Darren Morfitt.

Alice played softball at age five with her brothers and later served as a batgirl and player for the Finke and Herne club, which toured across Ohio, being selected at first base for the All-Star team in the 1937 State's Tournament. Nicknamed ◊¥Lefty◊¥ from school days, she also played basketball, field hockey, tennis and volleyball.Porter, David L. (2000) Biographical Dictionary of American Sports Greenwood Press. Hohlmayer graduated from Springfield High School in 1942. The next year she entered Ohio State University, where she had a chance to show her athletic talent. Then, she was discovered by an AAGPBL sport in 1945 while playing during a tournament in Cleveland, and later was contacted by the league's president Max Carey. Following a tryout at Pascagoula, Mississippi, Hohlmayer entered the league in 1946 with the Kenosha Comets, playing for them three years before joining the Muskegon Lassies (1949), Kalamazoo Lassies (1950) and Peoria Redwings (1950‚Äì1951). She opened at first base, then gradually started to pitch until becoming a full-time pitcher, showing good batting skills and a hard throwing arm. The versatile Hohlmayer hurled 42 consecutive scoreless innings in 1950, and also made 21 putouts at first base in a regular game. Her most productive season came in 1951, when she posted a 15‚Äì11 record with a 2.02 earned run average and 209 innings of work in 29 pitching appearances. Besides this, she gained notoriety for having a hit against legendary pitcher Satchel Paige during an All-Star exhibition game.Heaphy, Leslie A.; May, Mel Anthony 2006).

In seven postseason games, she hit .136 (3-for-22) and had a 1.29 ERA in seven innings without a decision. Hohlmayer continued studying while playing baseball, graduating in 1949 from Ohio State with bachelor's degrees in physical education and health. After the 1951 season she returned home to help save the family laundromat business. Later she married William McNaughton and moved to Fairfield, California, where she taught at school and worked 17 years for the local finance department and recreation services, while coaching Little League Baseball in her spare time. When widowed in 1960, she brought her two children, Maichele and Sean. After retiring in 1979, she played on a men's 55-plus softball team which advanced to the World Slow Pitch Tournament. She also managed a softball team for five years before moving to San Diego, California. In 1988, Alice became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

This partnership aims to connect coastal communities facing offshore wind development to address common challenges and opportunities posed by offshore wind. By working collaboratively, citizens can share experiences, information, and resources, and help build a unified movement towards the acceptance of offshore wind. Right now, the United States is more than 20 years behind Europe in adopting this established technology. The United States‚Äô deeply rooted affiliations with the fossil fuel industry have allowed us to remain dependent on unhealthy and dangerous fuels. The East Coast and Great Lakes have an immense opportunity to produce clean energy and boost local economies by accepting offshore wind as a viable, preferable energy resource. It is in the public‚Äôs best interest to support offshore wind because of its great potential to improve our health, economy and energy security. While we as a collaborative support offshore wind as one of the many sources of renewable energy that can meet our needs, we require projects to be appropriately sited and to demonstrate proven benefits to the local community and environment. The initial gathering of 20 advocates representing communities in 15 coastal states produced a basis for collaboration that emphasized keeping the needs of communities at the forefront of the discussion of offshore wind. Sponsored by the Civil Society Institute (CSI) as a project that grew out of the CLEAN network, CPOW is directed by members of the collaborative. Civil Society Institute understands the immense contribution offshore wind power can make towards advancing a clean energy economy for the United States and reducing our dependence on unhealthy and dangerous fossil fuels, and therefore initiated the formation of this partnership.

Founded in 1911, it completed its first synagogue building by 1916, and its current building in 1957, with an addition to the current building completed in 1973. Eli Fishman was the congregation's rabbi from 1970 to 1997. He was succeeded by Kenneth Greene, who served for 13 years. As of September 2016, the Rabbi is Ira Samuel Grussgott, and the president is Jeffrey Malkin. History =Early history= In July 1911, a charter was drawn up for the formation of an Orthodox synagogue named Congregation Agudath Achim Anshai. Many of the founders had immigrated to the United States from Russia and Poland. Raphael Riemer, who immigrated to Freehold from Russia in 1906, was the synagogue‚Äôs first rabbi and cantor. Louis Finegold, a local merchant, was the first President of the synagogue. In 1911, the synagogue had a membership of 40 families. The synagogue was first built, at a land and construction cost of approximately $1,000, as a small (32' x 50') wooden structure on the corner of First Street and Center Street in Freehold between 1911 and 1916, by the Freehold Hebrew Association, which had been established in 1894. The synagogue's religious school started at that location in September 1914. Dues were $6 ($ today). The synagogue added a second floor to the building in 1916. The synagogue formed a sisterhood in 1920, and that year a mikva was constructed below the synagogue. The synagogue also established a cemetery on Route 33 in Freehold, which it has maintained for more than 90 years. =1940‚Äì2000= In the 1940s, the Ku Klux Klan became active in the Howell Township area, and members of the synagogue regularly patrolled the synagogue grounds armed with shotguns to protect it against Klan members. An old Torah on display in the synagogue was rescued from a ruined synagogue in Italy by World War II veteran Jack Steinberg and later restored. Synagogue membership in the synagogue had grown to 100 families by 1943, and 184 families by 1950. During the 1950s and 1960s, synagogue membership in the synagogue reached 400. It changed its name to Freehold Jewish Center in the 1960s. Rabbi Eli Fishman was the synagogue's rabbi from 1970 until his retirement in 1997. He was succeeded by Rabbi Kenneth Greene, who retired in 2011. In 2011, the synagogue was led by Rabbi Dr. Tal Sessler. =21st century= In 2002, the synagogue commissioned the writing of a new torah scroll, for $30,000. The following year, it was one of a number of area synagogues that took part in helping fund the building of a new home for a family, under the auspices of the Freehold Area Habitat for Humanity. In April 2003, the synagogue named its chapel the Oglensky Chapel, after David Oglensky, a synagogue member and soldier who had been a lieutenant and commander in the 740th Tank Battalion of the U.S. First Army killed in the Battle of the Bulge, who for his gallantry was awarded posthumously the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. Family members had constructed the synagogue's ark and benches by hand after his death. In 2006, the synagogue had a membership of 260 families. By 2010, membership had fallen to 175 families. In 2011, to commemorate its centennial year, the synagogue planned a series of events. Past president Jerry Einhorn said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful we have reached our 100th year. It‚Äôs a beautiful synagogue, and I look forward to its next 500 years.‚Äù That year marked Greene's 13th and final year as the congregation's rabbi. As of 2016 the congregation's Rabbi is Ira Samuel Grussgott, the Cantor is Aron Heller, the Executive Director is Marvin Krakower and the President is Jesse Glick. Broad Street Synagogue building Ground was broken in 1947 for a new synagogue, on lots 250' x 175' that were purchased in 1943 and 1945, responding to the need for a larger one. In 1957, the new synagogue was completed on the corner of Broad Street and Stokes Street. The synagogue was dedicated on August 25, 1957, with Governor Robert B. Meyner and his wife as guests of honor. David Metz was president of the synagogue at the time. In 1973, an addition was added to the synagogue, containing classrooms and offices, and expanding the sanctuary. The synagogue's sanctuary and extension are flanked in beautiful stained glass windows. The building also houses 12 classrooms, social halls, a 350-person formal ballroom, a youth lounge, a library, a smaller chapel, and kosher kitchens.

The neighborhood is located in the southeast section of Baltimore city and borders the 137 acre park of the same name on the north and east sides. Patterson Park is traditionally centered on the intersection of Baltimore Street and Linwood Avenue and until the formation of Patterson Park Neighborhood Association in 1986 was referred to as the Baltimore-Linwood Neighborhood. The original borders of Patterson Park neighborhood were Pratt Street to the south, Fayette Street to the north, Milton Street to the west and Clinton Street to the east, but in 2011 the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association voted to expand the northern border to Orleans Street between Milton and Curley Street. Roughly two miles east of Baltimore's downtown district, Patterson Park is near the neighborhoods of Butchers Hill, Canton, Fells Point, Highlandtown, and McElderry Park. History =Founding= Patterson Park homes were first developed between the mid-19th century and early 20th century to accommodate the swelling population of Baltimore City after the Civil War. William Patterson owned much of the land that now constitutes the Patterson Park neighborhood. In 1827, he donated 5 acres of land in what we now know as Patterson Park to the city for a public walk. His heirs were less interested in donating the land that remained; and instead leased the land to speculative builders, who then raised rowhouses on it. The builders sold these homes at a profit, while the Patterson heirs collected ground rent on the leased land.Origins Origins of Patterson Park. Retrieved 2011-09-26 Affectionately known as \\"marble houses,\\" the typical Patterson Park rowhouse was built in Renaissance Revival, or Italianate, style. They have restrained flat roofs; flat, brown or red brick fa√ßades; molded and galvanized sheet-metal exterior cornices, often stamped with neoclassical decoration and dressed up with ball finials; stained glass transoms; and marble steps and trim. In the latter half of the 19th century, immigrant European laborers as well as free blacks like Frederick Douglass flocked to Baltimore seeking jobs in the waterfront factories, rail yards and wharves. The architect-designed homes of Bolton Hill and Mount Vernon were beyond their reach, but speculative builders built block upon block of narrow rowhouses on inexpensive land, including around Patterson Park. Architectural details changed over time, as building and manufacturing process advanced. For example, when plate glass became affordable in the late 1890s, builders replaced the tall, narrow Palladian first floor windows with a single, wide plate glass window‚Äîsome arched, some square. Three-story Victorians built circa 1900 to 1910 line the park's border. Two-story rowhomes dating from the 1920s line quaint and narrow side streets, some still paved with brick. Interiors often feature pressed tin ceilings, hardwood floors, stained glass windows and ornate moldings. Many houses still have original marble steps. By 1927, many of the immigrants were from Bohemia, thanks to the growth of the Czech population in nearby Little Bohemia. =Decline= The exodus of middle-class‚Äîand aspiring middle-class‚Äîwhites from the city center is not unique to the Patterson Park community. This is a characteristically American settlement pattern, stimulated by the advent of the electric trolley (streetcar) in 1888, and accelerated by social and economic transitions since then. The fabric of Southeast Baltimore's working class communities was woven from the availability of good blue-collar jobs in the manufacturing industries surrounding the waterfront. Plant closures, layoffs, and the general decline of the manufacturing sector began to weaken that fabric in the 1960s. Changes in the city's demographic composition fed fears and prejudice among residents who were suffering economic hardships. Profound social shifts arising from the civil rights movement strengthened the case for elimination of residential housing segregation, but the unintended consequence was white flight. Absentee landlords, property abandonment, predatory lending and property flipping fed the decline in Baltimore's downtown communities. Concerted efforts by the city's political and business establishment began to focus on downtown redevelopment in the 1970s. Such efforts slowed but did not halt housing abandonment and disinvestment in Southeast Baltimore in general, and Patterson Park in particular. The mid-1990s were a particularly difficult time for Patterson Park, as nearby public housing estates were shut down abruptly, leaving nearby residents looking for housing options. Absentee landlords in the Patterson Park neighborhood took advantage of the new transient population. The stresses further weakened the neighborhood. =Revitalization= Patterson Park Community Development Corporation In 1996, the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (PPCDC) was created to increase ownership rates and decrease vacancies in the area. Founder Ed Rutkowski had created the Patterson Park Neighborhood Initiative, hiring organizers to gather neighbors to define the issues affecting their neighborhoods including crime, less-than-robust city services and nuisances. Between 1996 and 2009, the PPCDC renovated about 300 Patterson Park rowhomes, many vacant. Since 1996, the area's vacancy rate declined from nearly twice that of the rest of Baltimore City to less than the average, the crime rate has dropped to less than half for violent offenses, and the average housing value has nearly tripled. In February 2009, the collapse of the housing market led the PPCDC to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Patterson Park Community Development Corporation Abell Foundation Patterson Park Community Development Corporation.

Founded to encourage city residents to be involved in community activities, PPNA has 300 active members. About Patterson Park Neighbors Retrieved 2011-09-27 The PPNA encourages neighborliness and foster resident volunteerism. The Association holds a monthly community meeting in a local church basement, and organizes block clean-ups, tree and flower plantings, holiday parties, pot lucks, home tours and block parties. Leadership PPNA leadership consists of an elected board, one president, four vice presidents, one treasurer, and one secretary. The vice presidents each represent one sector of PPNA: North, South, East and West Sectors with the dividing line of the sectors generally being Linwood Avenue and Baltimore Street. Elections take place every January and every seat is voted on during elections. Officeholders must live within Patterson Park borders and be a paying PPNA member. Greening Committee In a partnership with the Baltimore Neighborhood Energy Challenge, the PPNA Greening Committee is working to reduce the energy consumption of Baltimore by educating and encouraging residents to pledge to reduce their household energy use through efficiency. The Greening Committee has also been awarded over $60,000 in donations to finance its project, including major support from the Chesapeake Bay Trust, a state-chartered grant maker, and Healthy Neighborhoods Inc., a local nonprofit for tree plantings in the neighborhood. Patterson Park Tree Plantings Retrieved 2011-09-27 Alley gating In 2010, PPNA has fostered gated alleys: residents gate both ends of an alley and make it a park-like space for neighbors to enjoy. Baltimore Gated Alleys Retrieved 2011-09-27 Boundaries and Population Patterson Park is bounded by Baltimore Street to the north, Patterson Park Avenue to the west, Eastern Ave to the south, and Linwood Avenue to the east. As of 2010, Patterson Park was 44.3% white, 36% African American, 15.7% Hispanic, and 4% other.

He was an uncle of parliamentarian Nils Lavik and journalist Herbrand Lavik. Career From 1878 to 1887 Lavik worked as a travelling lay preacher for the organization Bergens Indremisjon. In 1885 he settled in Kvinnherad. He served as mayor of Kvinnherad for eight years, and represented the Moderate Liberal Party in S√∏ndre Bergenhus at the Parliament of Norway from 1889 to 1891. He was a co-founder of Det Vestlandske Indremisjonsforbund in 1898, an organization still active today with about 1,500 local chapters. Lavik served as the organization's first Secretary, and editor of its magazine Samb√•ndet. He was a member of the Church Commission of 1908. From 1917 he was headmaster of a bible school in Bergen. He published several books, including the song book Sions sange from 1901. A Pietist, he regarded activities such as dancing and cinema as unfavourable ways of socializing.

The parish's origins date to 1837, when it was first named Holy Cross parish. In 1850 it was renamed Saint John the Evangelist parish, and is the oldest Catholic parish in the city and in Marion County, Indiana. Considered the mother of the Catholic parishes in Indianapolis, it played an important role in development of the Catholic Church in the city. Saint John's Church served as the pro-cathedral of the diocese from 1878 until 1906; its rectory served as the bishop's residence and chancery from 1878 until 1892. In 1900 the church served as the site of first episcopal consecration held in Indianapolis. Although many considered Saint John's a diocesan cathedral, it was never officially named as such. Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral remained the official cathedral and Vincennes, Indiana, as the see city for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana, until March 28, 1898, when the episcopal see was transferred to Indianapolis and became the Diocese of Indianapolis. Diocesan functions continued to be held at Saint John's until Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built in 1906. Saint John's rectory continued to house the diocesan chancery until 1968, and served as the metropolitan tribunal for the diocese until 1982. Saint John's Church and rectory were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The present-day Saint John's Church, the parish's third and the second one built on the Georgia Street property, is the main structure in a group of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue. Diedrich A. Bohlen, principal and founder of the Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son, designed the rectory (1863), church (1867-71), and a rectory addition (1878).

The red-brick church has an eclectic style, including elements of French Gothic Revival and American Romanesque Revival architecture. The sanctuary has a seating capacity of 3,000. It was the largest church in Indiana when the cornerstone was laid in 1867; it was dedicated on July 2, 1871. History =Saint Johns parish= Holy Cross parish, the predecessor to Saint John the Evangelist, is the oldest Catholic parish in Indianapolis and in Marion County, Indiana. It is considered the mother of the Catholic parishes in Indianapolis, and played an important role in development of the Catholic Church in the city. The parish's origins date to 1837, when Father Vincent Bacquelin held the first regularly celebrated mass in Indianapolis at a local tavern. Father Bacquelin founded Holy Cross parish in November 1837 after the Diocese of Vincennes purchased a lot for the parish's first church on the northwest corner of Washington and California Streets, just south of Military Park. The new frame church, which measured about by , was known as the Chapel of the Holy Cross. The first mass was held in the church on October 11, 1840. In 1846 Bishop C√©lestine de la Hailandi√®re purchased three lots on Georgia Street, where it intersects Tennessee Street (present-day Capitol Avenue), for $2,300. The lots served as the site for a cluster of new buildings that would be built for the parish.Horan, p. 44 and 56-56. In 1850 a new brick church measuring by was built on the center lot facing south on Georgia Street, adjacent to the site of the present-day rectory. Father John Gu√©guen, the parish pastor at the time, changed the name of the parish to Saint John the Evangelist when the new church was completed. (Saint John the Evangelist was Father Bacquelin's patron saint.)Widner, p. 37. Father Bacquelin's successor, Augustus Bessonies, served as pastor at Saint Johns from 1857 to 1890, when the parish expanded to include a new church, rectory, and school buildings on Georgia Street.Father Bessonies, vicar general of the Diocese of Vincennes after 1872, also served as a diocese administrator from June 1877 to August 1878, and was designated a monsignor in 1884. After Bessonies retired from Saint Johns, he served as pastor at Saints Peter and Paul Parish in Indianapolis from 1892 until his death in 1901. His remains are interred in the Sacred Heart Chapel at Saint Johns Church. See Divita, p. 26, and Horan, pp. 158-59. In 1859 a new parish school was constructed at the corner of Georgia and Tennessee Streets (present-day Capitol Avenue) to house Saint Johns Academy, the city's first Catholic school. Founded by the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the- Woods, the school opened in September 1859. It remained at the site until Saint Johns Academy for Girls opened at 135 West Maryland Street in January 1874. The Georgia Street school building was later demolished. Saint Johns Academy on Maryland Street closed in 1959, and the building was demolished.Stineman and Porter, p. 33 and 35-39.Horan, pp. 87-88 and 90. In 1863 the parish built a new rectory adjacent to Saint Johns Church, and in 1867 a three-story brick school for boys. The Brothers of the Sacred Heart operated the school until 1929, and the building was later demolished.Stineman and Porter, p. 39.Horan, p. 94. Construction on the present-day Saint Johns Church began in April 1867, and the main building was completed in 1871. (Due to the expense the twin spires were not added until 1893.) In the early 1870s, when the Bishop of Vincennes, Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, visited Indianapolis, he resided at Saint Johns rectory and used the church as his proto-cathedral.Divita, pp. 21-23.Horan, pp. 113-15 and 119-22. Although the bishop considered making Indianapolis the episcopal see of the Diocese of Vincennes, he deferred the decision to Silas Chatard, his successor.Kennedy, pp. 34-35. The church nave with Christmas decoration. Saint Johns served as the proto-cathedral of the diocese from 1878, when Bishop Silas Chatard established his residence and chancery there, until 1906, when Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built in Indianapolis.Divita, p. 25, 29, and 37. Although Bishop St. Palais temporarily resided at Saint Johns when he visited Indianapolis, his successor, Bishop Chatard, formally obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to establish the bishop's residence at Indianapolis. After Chatard's consecration as Bishop of Vincennes on May 12, 1878, in Rome, Italy, he traveled to Indiana and arrived in Indianapolis on August 17, 1878.Horan, pp. 143-44. Within a month after his arrival in the city, Bishop Chatard commissioned noted Indianapolis architect Diedrich A. Bohlen, principal and founder of the architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son, to design an addition to Saint Johns rectory that would service as the bishop's residence and house the diocesan chancery.Horan, p. 146. The rectory addition served as the bishop's residence from August 1878 until April 18, 1892, when Bishop Chatard moved into the newly built rectory at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets in the Saint Peter and Paul parish.Horan, p. 158. When Bishop Chatard moved to Indianapolis in 1878, many considered Saint Johns as a diocesan cathedral, but it was never officially named as such.Widner, p. 36 and 188. Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral remained the official cathedral and Vincennes, Indiana, as the see city for the Diocese of Vincennes until March 28, 1898, when Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the episcopal see to Indianapolis and it became the Diocese of Indianapolis.Kennedy, p. 37 and 90. Because Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, the new cathedral for the Diocese of Indianapolis, was not built until 1906, diocesan functions continued to be held at Saint Johns Church in the interim. Bishop Chatard called four diocesan synods (in 1878, 1880, 1886, and 1891) during his residency at Saint Johns.Stineman and Porter, p. 37. Some functions remained at Saint Johns even longer. Its rectory continued to house the diocesan chancery until 1968, and it served as the metropolitan tribunal for the diocese until 1982.Divita, pp. 32-33. Father Bessonies's successor, Monsignor Francis H. Gavisk became vicar general for the Diocese of Indianapolis and was Saint Johns pastor from 1890 to 1932. He continued work to complete the church in 1893. On May 12, 1903, Bishop Chatard celebrated his Silver Episcopal Jubilee with a Pontifical High Mass at Saint Johns. The celebration marked the last significant diocesan event at the church.Divita, pp. 22-23. The church was restored for its centennial anniversary in 1971. Saint Johns church and rectory were placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1985 Saint Johns church once again served as the proto-cathedral for some liturgical functions of the diocese, including ordinations, when Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral underwent a major renovation.Stineman and Porter, p. 34 and 39. =Church and rectory construction= Saint Johns Church is the main structure in a cluster of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue. Construction of these building was completed in phases. Diedrich A. Bohlen designed the rectory (1863), the present-day Saint Johns Church (1867-71), and bishop's residence/rectory addition (1878). (Other D. A. Bohlen-designed buildings related to the parish include Saint Johns school for boys (1867), across the alley from the rectory, and the Saint Johns Academy for Girls (1872-74), on nearby Maryland Street.) Bohlen's son, Oscar, designed the twin spires on the two towers that flank the main facade and supervised their construction. The Bohlen-designed red-brick, two-story rectory (1863), which predates the present-day church, faces south on Georgia Street. The rectory addition built on the site of the old Saint Johns Church was completed in July 1879. The estimated cost to construct the addition and a brick passageway to the church's sacristy was $10,000 at the time of the construction.Horan, p. 147. Construction on the present-day church, the second one on the Georgia Street site, began in 1867. Funds from private donors and parish fund-raising efforts paid for construction of the church, which cost an estimated $120,000 at the time it was built.Divita, p. 19-21. Unlike the first church on the site, which faced Georgia Street, the present-day church faces west on Capitol Avenue. Bishop St. Palais laid the cornerstone on July 21, 1867. John B. Purcell, Archbishop of Cincinnati, dedicated the new church on July 2, 1871. Due to the expense, the twin spires were not added until 1893. Saint Johns was closed from February 1893 to September 14, 1893, to construct the spires, install a pipe organ, and decorate the interior.Divita, pp. 22-23. Description The present-day Saint Johns Church has an eclectic style, including elements of French Gothic Revival and American Romanesque Revival architecture. =Exterior and plan= The church is constructed of red brick laid in a modified Flemish bond and white limestone corner buttresses over a limestone foundation. It has an arched main entrance, a square cupola, and twin spires. The basic cruciform plan includes a shallow transept, nave, and a half-octagon apse. The sanctuary has a seating capacity of 3,000.Horan, p. 57, 121-122. Saint Johns was the largest church in Indiana when the cornerstone was laid in 1867. The church measures wide, long, and tall. Its twin spires are tall. The main facade facing Capitol Avenue is divided into three sections with three portals faced in stone.Horan, p. 120. The three-story gabled center section contains the main entrance with large wooden doors. Limestone Corinthian order columns support a compound Gothic arch. The stone tympanum above the main portal includes Joseph Quarmby's life-size representation of John the Evangelist pondering the scriptures, and the church's construction dates (1867 and 1871) are inscribed in stone over the main entrance.Stineman and Porter, pp. 7-8. A half-circle stone cap bears the inscription \\"D.O.M. \\" (Deo optimo maximo), meaning \\"To God, the Best and Greatest.\\"Divita, p. 21. A gabled parapet with a blind trefoil and a cross surmounts the arch. A rose window is installed in the center at the second-story level. The facade's two tower sections, topped with identical copper spires on the left and right, include an additional entrance with wooden doors. Each tower has four upper levels separated by belted courses and include openings at each level. =Interior= Church sanctuary The Gothic sanctuary includes Corinthian columns and ribbed vaulting. An organ and choir gallery is built at the rear of the nave, above the narthex. The curved ceiling with poplar ribs is painted in a light color.Divita, p. 23. Guy Leber, an Italian-Swiss painter from Louisville, Kentucky, painted the ceiling of the apse with The Angels of Glory (white-robed angels and halo-crowned seraphs).Divita, p. 25.Stineman and Porter, pp. 28-29. The church's original walls included oak wainscoting extending from the floor, a painted wall, and a simple border.Horan, p. 121. Stonecarver Henry R. Sanders made the interior capitals and pillars in staff (plaster of Paris and manila fiber cast in a gelato mold) The four coats of arms, also in staff, of Pope Pius IX, Bishop St. Palais, Pope Leo XIII, and Bishop Chatard, who were the leaders of the Catholic Church and the Diocese of Vincennes when construction of the church began and when it was completed, were installed on the sanctuary's walls in 1893. Statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph flank the apse. L. Chovet of Paris, France, provided paintings for the Stations of the Cross. The high altar, made of Italian marble, and French Gothic pulpit, made of quartered oak, were added in 1893. The church's original pews were constructed of black walnut.Stineman and Porter, p. 14, 23, and 28. A mosaic tile floor, installed in 1905, replaced carpeting.Divita, p. 23-25. The church contains four chapels along the nave, two on each side. The Saint Patrick and Piet√† chapels on the right were gifts of Bishop Chatard; the Sacred Heart and Saint Anne chapels were gifts of Father Bessonies. The Saint Patrick Chapel contains a statue of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland; the Piet√† chapel contains a statue of the Mother of Sorrows; the Sacred Heart Chapel contains a statue of the Sacred Heart; and the Saint Anne Chapel includes an altar and statue of Saint Anne and her daughter, the Virgin Mary. Each of the four side chapels contains two art nouveau-style glass windows that were installed in 1893.Stineman and Porter, pp. 18-21. Twenty-five leaded-glass windows were installed in the church's exterior walls. The original rose window on the west fa√ßade was destroyed in a hailstorm in 1923. The Emil Frei Art Glass Company designed its replacement, which depicts Saint John on the island of Patmos; it was installed in 1924. Musicians and musical instruments surround the central design. The stained- glass window in the center of the apse was a gift from Bishop St. Palais; it depicts Saint John's vision in the Apocalypse. The art-glass window in the former baptistery depicts Christ's baptism in the Jordan River. Twenty of the remaining twenty-two windows were designed in 1942 by Henry Keck Studios of Syracuse, New York.Stineman and Porter, p. 11 and 15. A pipe organ built in 1989 is installed in the organ gallery at the rear of the sanctuary. Its organ case comes from the original instrument, installed in 1894 that was destroyed during a hailstorm in 1923. A portion of the pipework was retained from a previous organ built for the church in 1935. Alterations to the original interior when it was refurbished in 1971 included repositioning the altar to face the congregation, moving the baptismal font to the left transept, and removal of communion rails. =Rectory= The rectory was built in two phases. The two-story east section was built in 1863. The three-story bishop's residence and chancery was built in 1879. The bishop's residence is attached to the rectory's east side. Both buildings face Georgia Street and are constructed of red brick laid in Flemish bond and trimmed in limestone. The 1863 building is constructed over a limestone foundation and includes a three- bay fa√ßade with steps leading to the entrance. The rectory's fa√ßade has a Flemish gable and a Tudor-Gothic arch that shelters the entrance door, sidelights, and transom. The 1879 addition is more Victorian in style. Its openings are arched, and the front fa√ßade features a two-story bay. A red- brick wall in Flemish bond separates the rectory and addition from Georgia Street. Services As of 2015 the parish continues under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Mass is celebrated on Sunday 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 7 p.m.; Saturday 6:30 p.m.; Weekdays, Mon. to Fri., 12:10 p.m.; and Holy Days, 12:10 p.m. and 7 p.m. Ordinations Auxiliary bishop Denis O'Donaghue was consecrated at Saint Johns Church on April 25, 1900; it was the first episcopal consecration held in Indianapolis. Membership Membership declined for several decades after the turn of the century, when local families began to leave the downtown area and move to the city's suburbs. Parish membership of 3,000 in the 1880s had decreased to less than 30 by the 1970s. In 1971, the church's centennial, it assumed a new ministry to serve Indianapolis visitors and downtown workers. The church's location across the street from the Indianapolis Convention Center and its proximity to downtown hotels and attractions makes it a convenient gathering place for convention attendees and other visitors. As of 2017 parish membership has increased to 1200 households.

She was the first female member in the Stockholm City Council, and also the first elected female politician of her country as a whole (1910). Life =Early life= Gertrud M√•nsson was born in Stockholm to the iron worker Johannes M√•nsson and Charlotta Christina Lindqvist. Because of her poverty, she left school at the age of eleven to support herself as a maidservant. By 1896, she had managed to open her own shop in Vasastaden. =Early career= Gertrud M√•nsson educated herself through autodidacticism and engaged herself in politics and the Swedish Social Democratic Party. On 11 June 1892, she became one of the co-founders of the Stockholms allm√§nna kvinnoklubb, which was the first women's branch of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. She became a member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party the same year, and served as the chairperson of the Stockholms allm√§nna kvinnoklubb three times: 1892‚Äì1895, 1897‚Äì1898, and 1906‚Äì1908. Between 1897 and 1900, she served as chairperson of the Commune of Female agitation, and as secretary in 1900‚Äì1902. In 1902, she was elected to the board of the Women's Trade Union alongside Anna Johansson Visborg and Anna Sterky. Between 1907 and 1922, she was a member of the Gustav Vasa parish poor care board, and its chairperson in 1922. By a reform in 1909, women became eligible for municipal and city councils in Sweden, and in the following election in 1910, 37 women were elected to city councils and municipal councils all over Sweden, all of them being, in effect, the first elected female politicians of their country. In Stockholm city council, two women were elected: the social democrat Gertrud M√•nsson, and the right wing Valfrid Palmgren. As the votes were counted in the capital first, and the votes from the area electing M√•nsson were counted prior to the area of Palmgren, Gertrud M√•nsson could be regarded as the first woman elected in Sweden. M√•nsson had been nominated as candidate of her party because of her previous assignments in the poor care board. After the 1910 election, Gertrud M√•nsson as well as Valfrid Palmgren was interviewed by Idun (magazine), where M√•nsson commented: \\"What is to be done, I can not say now, before I have had the time to acquaint myself with the details of the office. But if I can ever in even some degree be of use to better the appalling living conditions, the source of so much discomfort and misery, it would be the greatest joy to me. But me, what can I do, other than what life have taught me?\\"Idun, nr. 14, 1910 =Member of the city council= M√•nsson had a respected reputation within her party as a wise and independent character with the capabilities of a leader. She has been described as a strong character, correct and reliable with: \\"a warm hearth for her class and for those who suffer as well as great knowledge.\\" When she took her seat as newly elected member of the Stockholm city council in 1910, a fellow member of the city council, a wealthy male merchant, asked her if they were acquainted, to which she replied: \\"Yes, I was in service as a maid to the upper classes and use to buy groceries in your shop, Mr Grocer!\\" During her tenure as city Councillor, M√•nsson focused on issues of social politics and welfare. This was her main interests as a politician because of her background in poverty, and it was also issues regarded as suitable and non-controversial for the first elected women politicians. Her main focus within this issue was the question of housing and living conditions and she was actively involved in the building projects discussed in the council. Though she seldom spoke and normally kept herself in the background, she informed herself of all questions and acted upon them, and it was said of her: \\"She belonged to those silent ones who alongside thousand others built our working movement and brought it forward.\\" She was seen as a pioneer within social politics as well as being one of the pioneers of the social democratic women's movement. She was a member of the Stockholm city council in 1910‚Äì1915 and 1919‚Äì1931. During her first term, she was a delegate of the poor care board's bureau for the handling of social benefit in 1912-15 and 1920‚Äì30; member of the board of the Stockholm city's house of correction for girls in 1912-16; a member of the poor care board for social benefit housing in 1917. Because the members of the city councils received no salary, M√•nsson was forced to retract her candidature in the 1915 election because she experienced difficulties in handling both her political assignments as well as the shop by which she supporter herself, but she accepted a nomination to be a candidate in the 1919 election, in which she was re-elected: she sold her shop and started to work as an office clerk at Systembolaget instead. During her second term in the city council, she served as a delegate of the poor care board's bureau for the handling of social benefit in 1920-30; and as a member of the child care authorities in 1925‚Äì26.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Kymi-Aliveri, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipal unit has an area of 167.616 km2. The ancient Euboean Kyme is mentioned as a harbor town related to the more prominent poleis of Chalkis and Eretria in antiquity. Together with these, it is sometimes named as the founding metropolis of the homonymous Kymƒì (Cumae) in Italy, an important early Euboean colony, which was probably named after it. There are few or no archaeological traces of ancient Euboean Kyme, and its exact location is not known. A Bronze Age settlement has been excavated in nearby Mourteri. Some modern authors believe that Kyme never existed as an independent polis in historical times but that it was a mere village dependent on either Chalkis or Eretria. Attractions Visitors have plenty to see in Kymi, a beautiful small town and surrounding region that overlooks the Aegean Sea. Due to its picturesque vantage point Kymi is sometimes called \\"The Balcony of the Aegean.\\" Kymi has one of the largest man- made ports in the country and serves as a transportation hub for the eastern Aegean islands and northern Greece. The City Kymi is considered the greenest of Greece in terms of native vegetation and is second all in clean sand beaches. There are numerous tourist and sightseeing attractions. Such as the house of the famous pathologist and researcher George Papanicolaou, inventor of the Pap Smear, the Folklore Museum of Kymi, the Monastery of the Transfiguration, three small Byzantine churches in Oxilithos, the Archaeological Collection and the Archaeological Sites, and a ruined Venetian tower in San handkerchief etc. The most well known agricultural products produced in Kymi are figs, cherries and olive oil.

Amazon.com. https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B000APBWUC whose first work, How To Shit in the Woods was published in 1989. Her writing is characterized by the use of humor and irreverence. She has two published works in print: her warmly welcomed outdoor guide How to Shit in the Woods: An Environmentally Sound Approach to a Lost Art and her Wild West memoir Barefoot Hearted: A Wild Life Among Wildlife.  How to Shit in Woods  The fourth edition of How to Shit in the Woods with a foreword by Bill McKibben will be in stores on March 3, 2020. The first edition of the guidebook was published by Ten Speed Press in 1989. It does, indeed, revolve around the many strategies Meyers has noticed for defecating where there is no modern toilet and running water. As one reads the book, it quickly becomes obvious that Meyer's concern is not only for the comfort of the camper or hiker, but for the impact that human waste leaves on pristine natural ecosystems. She talks about digging \\"environmentally sound\\" holes, locating the high water line, so as not to inadvertently pollute a stream or ground water source, and what types of soil facilitate quickest decomposition without risk of environmental contamination. The damage to humans and wildlife from carelessly disposed human waste comes in many forms including giardia, diarrhea, and intestinal diseases. A second edition of the book was issued in 1994 and a third edition in 2011. Meyer holds humans uniquely responsible for the spread of giardia in the wilderness areas of the United States: \\"Until 1970, there were no reports in the United States of waterborne outbreaks of giardia. The first . . . occurred in Aspen, Colorado, in 1970. Over the next four years, many cases were documented in travelers returning from . . . Leningrad . . . The Soviet Union became more open to visitation by Westerners at about this time and Leningrad's municipal water supply was full of Giardia cysts.\\" In its various editions, the book has been reviewed by Audubon Magazine, The New Zealand Dominion Post, and The Globe and Mail Audubon magazine writer Frank Graham wrote ‚ÄúKathleen Meyer has contributed to environmental awareness while lending a grand old English word the respectability it hasn‚Äôt had since Chaucer‚Äôs day.‚Äù  Barefoot-Hearted  In Barefoot-Hearted, published by Random House in 2001, Meyer writes about renovating a dilapidated barn in which to live with her life mate. Her book explores the many adversities of trying to live in a barn, not the least of which is how the smell of resident skunks under the floor permeates and resides in her clothes and hair and how the barn is infested with flies and mice. In the manner of nature writers who often use a small animal or plant as a symbol of an ecological principle, Meyer explains that she doesn't feel guilty about trapping and killing mice, because they are abundant and their population ever growing. By contrast, she notes the comparative frailty of bears who often stumble upon human habitations looking for food. After contact with humans, a bear is often trapped and removed or euthanized. In the same book, Meyer also chronicles her and Patrick‚Äôs adventures driving a team and wagon across three Rocky Mountain states. Barefoot Hearted was widely reviewed.\\" The book was reviewed by Publishers Weekly. Personal life Meyer lives in western Montana.

Its primary focus is the use of economic incentives and targeted sanctions to establish the rule of law, provide a reliable and humane system of enforcement, and promote international cooperation for the progress of civilized society. The Forum was founded in 1982 by Howard S. Brembeck http://goshennews.com/local/x395796607/Church- honors-Howard-Brembeck to advance the idea that economic power, not military power, is the power that rules the world. Background The name of the organization comes from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1941 Annual Message to Congress as he outlined his vision for four essential freedoms that all people deserve ‚Äì freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear of war.http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/pdfs/ffreadingcopy.pdfhttp://goshennews.com/obituaries/x278369554/Howard- Brembeck Programs Since the Forum was founded nearly forty years ago, it has earned the trust of governments, international organizations, and experts around the world for policy-relevant research and advice as well as innovative work to encourage regional cooperation around common security goals. The Forum has designed and implemented programs on five continents that have forged partnerships to help governments and civil society organizations to effectively address the most urgent global security threats. The Forum established and provided core support to the Global Center on Cooperative Security and it is now thriving as an independent organization. The Forum also continues to work on international security issues including nonproliferation, sanctions and incentives, and preventing violent extremism. The Forum and the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame formed a partnership to create the Sanctions and Security Research Program that played a key role internationally by recommending the shift from general trade sanctions that can harm civilian populations to the use of more targeted measures (also called smart sanctions). Today smart sanctions are employed with increasing frequency and sophistication by the U.S. as well as by the UN, the European Union, and the African Unionhttp://kroc.nd.edu/research/sanctions The Forum has also consistently focused on protecting national security without the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Forum collaborates with senior military officers and other experts to stimulate discussions in local communities across the country and have engaged community leaders, policy experts, and ecumenical groups to encourage the U.S. and other governments to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons.http://www.domlife.org/Justice/Disarmament/tool_kit.pdf The Forum publishes articles, reports, and books assessing the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and offers practical suggestions to reduce or eliminate these dangers.http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/university-pittsburgh-present-lecture- overcoming-nuclear-dangers-us-policy-citizens-role  References  Category:Non-profit organizations based in Indiana Category:Organizations established in 1982 Category:Goshen, Indiana Category:1982 establishments in Indiana ","title":"Fourth Freedom Forum"},{"id":"33220936","text":"Edith North Johnson (January 2, 1903 ‚Äì February 28, 1988) was an American classic female blues singer, pianist and songwriter.

Biography She was born Edith North in 1903. She married Jesse Johnson, a St. Louis record producer. She originally worked at her husband's Deluxe Music Store as a saleswoman. Although not a professional singer, Johnson recorded eighteen sides in 1928 and 1929. She started on QRS Records in 1928. She then switched to Paramount, recording at a session in Grafton, Wisconsin, attended by Charley Patton It is reckoned that Patton did not play on any of her recordings. Using pseudonyms such as Hattie North (on Vocalion) and Maybelle Allen, Johnson also recorded other tracks for small labels. Under the name Hattie North, she recorded \\"Lovin' That Man Blues\\" with Count Basie. During World War II, Johnson managed a taxicab operation in St. Louis. She ran Johnson's Deluxe Cafƒó after her husband's death, in 1946. Samuel Charters located her in 1961 and recorded her, accompanied by Henry Brown, for the anthology album The Blues in St. Louis, released by Folkways Records. Her recording of \\"Honey Dripper Blues\\" was the inspiration for the nickname used by Roosevelt Sykes. In her later life, Johnson spent time undertaking social work in her hometown. She died in St. Louis in February 1988, at the age of 85. Four of her recordings are included in the boxed set Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton (2001).

The program features physical medium Amy Allan and former NYPD homicide detective Steve DiSchiavi, who investigate allegedly haunted locations at the request of their clients in an effort to provide proof of paranormal activity. Each partner is depicted exploring the case independently of the other, so as not to influence their portion of the investigation. They, along with their client(s), then come together during the program's final segment, the \\"reveal,\\" when they compare their findings with one another. The twelfth season aired from December 3, 2019, to April 23, 2020. Show format Opening introduction: After items such as family pictures, trinkets, or personal effects have been removed from a location claimed to be haunted, Allan walks through attempting to communicate with ghosts and spirits. Meanwhile, Dischiavi questions residents, employees, and local experts in genealogy, local history and law enforcement regarding the site's history. Later, Allan collaborates with a sketch artist to create drawings of spirits she claims to have channeled during her walk- through. The episodes conclude with a \\"reveal\\", where the drawings will often appear to match Dischiavi's findings.  Criticism  According to skeptical reviewer Karen Stollznow, Allan often claims to find the same activity, such as shadow people, in multiple locations. Some items - such as religious iconography - are not removed but often left in locations. Stollznow notes that Allan appears to offer no evidence to verify her suggestion she had no preexisting knowledge of a location, which could be problematic for well-known ones such as Alcatraz or the Lizzie Borden house. Stollznow characterizes DiSchiavi as more of a \\"biased believer\\" than a skeptic, and suggests that the show is edited in order to make his investigation appear accurate, removing parts of Allan's observations that don't align with DiSchiavi's findings.

Initially, European Union (EU)‚ÄìIndonesia relations were facilitated through the EU‚ÄìAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cooperation. Bilateral cooperation was continuously expanded and eventually the EU Delegation to Indonesia was opened in 1988. Economic and political dialogue between Indonesia and the EU takes the form of regular Senior Officials Meetings. In 2000 relations were further reinforced with the release of the European Commission's communication \\"Developing Closer Relations between Indonesia and the EU\\". In November 2013, the EU‚Äôs high representative for foreign and security policy Catherine Ashton made her first-ever official visit to Indonesia which was hailed as a long-awaited breakthrough in the EU‚Äôs relationship with Indonesia. Economic Relations The EU and Indonesia have built robust commercial relations, with bilateral trade amounting to approximately ‚Ç¨25 billion in 2012 resulting in a sizeable ‚Ç¨5.7 billion trade surplus for Indonesia with the EU. In the past few years trade between EU and Indonesia has been marked by an upward trend. Whereas total trade was worth almost ‚Ç¨16 billion in 2009, by 2011 it had already reached ‚Ç¨23.5 billion. For the EU, Indonesia is the 24th largest import source (share 0.9%) and the 30th largest export destination (share 0.6%). Inside the ASEAN-region, Indonesia ranks fourth in terms of total trade. The EU is Indonesia's 4th largest trading partner after Japan, China and Singapore, representing almost 10% of its total external trade. The EU is the second largest investor in the Indonesian economy. Indonesia mostly exports to the EU agricultural products and processed resources, mainly palm oil, fuels and mining products, textiles and furniture. EU exports to Indonesia consist mainly of high-tech machinery and transport equipment, chemicals and various manufactured goods. Essentially, trade flows between Indonesia and the EU complement each other. After negotiations on a free trade agreement with ASEAN got increasingly difficult, the EU began pursuing negotiations with individual ASEAN states. The EU and Indonesia are currently working towards an ambitious Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement covering trade, investment and services. Framework for EU-Indonesia cooperation In 2009 the EU-Indonesia partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) was signed. The PCA paved the way for closer cooperation in a wide range of fields and covers diverse areas of cooperation, such as trade, investment, human rights and climate change. The Agreement envisions four priority areas, namely education, human rights and democracy, trade and investment, and the environment. Development Cooperation During the 1970s and 1980s, most official assistance from European countries to Indonesia was coordinated through the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), an official grouping of donor countries established in 1976 and chaired by The Netherlands. Later, from 1992, after a disagreement between The Netherlands and Indonesia about aid policies, IGGI was disbanded and replaced by the Consultative Group on Indonesia chaired by the World Bank. TMore recently, the Indonesia Country Strategy Paper (CSP) outlines the overall development cooperation policies of the EU for 2007 to 2013. In line with this document, the EU collaborates closely with the Government of Indonesia to ensure that aid contributes to the national development strategy. Partnerships and projects are designed to support the Government of Indonesia's policies, laid out in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, which runs from 2009 to 2014. Against this backdrop, the EU focuses its efforts on education, economic development, climate change, environment and good governance. EU funding for projects in Indonesia takes a variety of forms including a large sector budget support allocation to the education sector. =Education= Strong emphasis is put on education representing almost 80% of the foreseen funding. This corresponds to the priority given by the Indonesian Government to education reforms. The EU's bilateral assistance supports Indonesia‚Äôs reform policies for basic education. It also provides budget support amounting to ‚Ç¨180 million. In addition, the EU contributes ‚Ç¨20 million to a technical cooperation facility which supports analytical work to develop governmental policies related to education and an additional 35 million to promote minimum service standards within education in a 110 districts considered to be lacking behind.EU Delegation Jakarta, 2012. Bluebook EU- Indonesia Development Cooperation The EU also funds other projects that are in line with the national education strategy. These are implemented in close cooperation with local authorities and NGOs. These projects have different focal points ranging from vocational training, inclusive education to good teaching and learning practices. The EU and its member states also support the higher education sector. Since 2004 the EU has provided Indonesian students with the opportunity to obtain scholarships through the Erasmus Mundus programme. The EU and its Member States provide 1,250 scholarships annually for Indonesians to study at European universities. =Trade and investment= The Delegation lends its support to deepen Indonesia's integration into the international trade system. The objective is to help the country realise its full trade and investment potential. Through programs such as the EU-Indonesia Trade Support Programme (TSP II) http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/indonesia/documents/eu_indonesia/tsp2_en.pdf and the EU-Indonesia Trade Cooperation Facility (TCF) the EU seeks to support government agencies in enhancing Indonesia's export infrastructure and creating favourable investment conditions. Moreover, the EU assists Indonesia in reforming its public finance management and in bringing about sound fiscal conditions. This support specifically focuses on issues such as budget planning and execution, tax and customs administration, public procurement and auditing, as well as legislative budgetary oversight. =Environment and Climate Change= Indonesia has committed to cut carbon emissions by 26% by 2020, a goal that has the full economic and political support of the EU and its Member States. Analogously, The EU has intensified climate change cooperation launching programmes that facilitate sustainable management of forests and natural resources. The EU assists Indonesia in addressing the most pressing environmental issues such as illegal logging through constructing Voluntary Partnership Agreements. Over the last three years, the EU and its Member States have supported Indonesia‚Äôs climate change initiatives with US$1.5 billion (‚Ç¨1.17 billion) of which the EU has contributed almost half. =Good Governance and Human Rights= A new EU-Indonesia Human Rights Dialogue was launched in 2009 to intensify exchanges on questions of mutual interest. The EU focuses on key areas of governance such as justice and security sector reform, law enforcement, and the support of human rights based community policing. Public institutions are supported in improving service delivery, particularly to the most vulnerable groups.EU Delegation Jakarta, 2012. Bluebook EU-Indonesia Development Cooperation. One important tool in this regard is the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), whose aim it is to provide support for the promotion of democracy and human rights in non-EU countries. In Indonesia, projects under this program range from promoting freedom of religion and belief and supporting human rights defenders, to increasing human rights accountability and helping prevent torture. Oftentimes the focus lies on vulnerable segments of society such as children, women or minorities. Within the field of good governance other focal areas are capacity building in the judicial sector as well as support to the anti-corruption commission. =Health, Water and Sanitation= The EU's health support focuses on disease control and improving regulations. In order to halt the transmission of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the EU and its Member States contribute about 57% of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), and Indonesia has benefited from a commitment of ‚Ç¨478 million from this fund since 2002. The EU teamed up with UNICEF to combat malnutrition and stunting among children. The improvement of sexual and reproductive health rights is also on the cooperation agenda. =Post-Disaster Reconstruction and Disaster Preparedness and Conflict Prevention= The EU supports Indonesia‚Äôs efforts to prevent and manage human crises through programmes aimed at minimising the effects of natural disasters. The EU's approach to post- disaster reconstruction encompasses infrastructure development, housing reconstruction, strengthening governance structures, capacity building, and developing economic and environmental sustainability. The EU also supports activities that help Indonesia resolve and prevent internal conflicts. While the causes of conflict are addressed through a number of projects in various areas, non-military means are used to facilitate the peaceful resolution and prevention of existing conflicts. Such means include supporting good policing, the rule of law, civil administration, and civil protection emergency teams. =The EU in Aceh= In 2004 a tsunami ravaged the coast of Aceh. The EU provided substantial amounts of emergency aid. The EU has supported reconstruction programmes with over ‚Ç¨200 million. Initially, ‚Ç¨3 million were allocated for emergency measures, followed by a further ‚Ç¨20 million earmarked for humanitarian assistance, which included temporary shelters, blankets, food, water and medical assistance. The EU also contributed to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF). This fund was used to rebuild damaged infrastructure such as roads, irrigation channels, and sanitation units. In addition, the construction of homes, schools and government offices was financed. In addition, the EU has contributed to the Aceh peace process. The EU funded mediation talks and deployed the Aceh Monitoring Mission to oversee the implementation of the peace agreement and contributed nearly ‚Ç¨30 million to help ensure the long-term stability of the peace process. In collaboration with national, international and local agencies, subsequent EU programmes focused on strengthening democratic institutions, building capacity in legal and policy making processes, and empowering civil society to participate in reform. Following almost 30 years of conflict and a devastating tsunami in 2004, today Aceh is considered back on track. The EU continues to work in the province, primarily in the area of climate change. Cooperation post 2013 Once the current cycle (2007-2013) expires, Indonesia will graduate from development assistance, but will continue to benefit from a number of thematic programmes as well as programmes related to the implementation of the Partnership agreement. Aviation The EU banned all Indonesian airlines from European territory in 2007, after the crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200. Aviation writer William Langewiesche wrote that \\"many of the ordinary Indonesians who had grown to hate their airlines were in favor of the ban simply as a form of punishment\\", that the ban put aircraft manufacturers \\"into a delicate position\\" as they would be selling to firms declared unsafe in the West, and that since Indonesian airlines were mainly focused on the Southeast Asian market, \\"The ban was largely symbolic\\". The ban has since been lifted.

Text at top is from the Fu style poem Ê≠∏Âéª‰æÜÂÖÆ. By Wang Zhongyu, Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). Six Dynasties poetry refers to those types or styles of poetry particularly associated with the Six Dynasties era of China (220 CE ‚Äì 589 CE). This poetry reflects one of the poetry world's more important flowerings, as well as being a unique period in Classical Chinese poetry, which, over this time period, developed a poetry with special emphasis on romantic love, gender roles, and human relationships. The Six Dynasties era is sometimes known as the \\"Age of Fragmentation\\", because China as a whole through this period lacked unification as a state, at least for any extended period of time; and, instead, many states rose and fell, often overlapping in existence with other states. Which of the various states and dynasties constituted the \\"6\\" dynasties of the Six Dynasties period varies somewhat according to which of the traditional selection criteria is chosen. The Six Dynasties era covers several somewhat overlapping main periods including all of the following: the Three Kingdoms (220‚Äì280), Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420, in 2 approximate parts, Western Jin 265‚Äì316 and Eastern Jin 317‚Äì420), the Sixteen Kingdoms (also known as the \\"Sixteen States\\", 304 to 439), and the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420‚Äì589). Sometimes, chronological discrepancies occur in regard to the turbulent political events of the time, from which these traditional historical-era designations derive, together with the somewhat different chronology of poetic (versus political) developments. Thus, neither the lives of the poets nor the trends in their poetry fit gently and neatly together with these period dates. Furthermore, conversions to the Common Era dating system can create further complications. However, regardless of the chronological difficulties, major developments of poetry during the Six Dynasties include formalizing the distinction between the Jian'an era regular yuefu and the shi style poetry, further development of the fu, theoretical work on technique, and the preservation of both Six Dynasties and earlier poetry by collecting and publishing many of the pieces which survive today into various anthologies consisting all or in part of poetry. Context The Six Dynasties poetic period formed an important link between the folk-ballad (yuefu) style prominent in the poetry of the Han dynasty and the following revival and experimentation with the older forms during the Tang dynasty. Even before the formal end of the Han Dynasty the poetic developments typical of that era had begun to yield to the Jian'an style, just as the political power of Han yielded more and more to that of the rising power of various regional hegemons, including Cao Cao and the Cao family. The Cao family was both poetically involved in this process towards the end of the Han era and into the beginning of the subsequent Three Kingdoms era, one of which kingdoms was founded by the Cao family as dynasts. The Cao family's new state, which they called Wei, also was the base area of the Sima clan, which increased in power over time, until one of the Sima family became Emperor Wu of Jin. The early phase of this Jin dynasty, known as Western Jin, provided a unified period for China (265‚Äì316), but lacking long-term stability. After this period, the Jin ceded control of the north to various successor states. However, the Jin dynasty as a whole was rather productive of poetry, both original works and collections and criticism. The north‚Äìsouth divide continued as a major feature in the landscape of Chinese poetry through the eventual Sui dynasty re-unification, which shortly gave way to the relatively unified and long term stability of the Tang dynasty, and a whole new poetic era of Tang poetry. =Han poetry= The received legacy of poetry during the Han dynasty includes the classical poetry traditions of the Shi Jing and the proto-Chu Ci. Specific developments of Han poetry included the developments along the lines of these two traditions and the lyrics of folk ballad style as exemplified in the Music Bureau tradition (yuefu). =Jian'an poetry= Cao Cao cites a poem before the Battle of Red Cliffs, portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing The development of Chinese poetry does not correspond precisely with the conventional dating of Chinese history by dynasty, despite certain correspondences between the political and poetic trends, with the period of actual transition between dynasties is especially problematic. This is indeed the case in discussing the important poets in the late Han and early Six Dynasties period, including the famous general Cao Cao (155‚Äì220), who may be reckoned in this period, although actually beginning his career in the Later/Eastern Han era. That is, the final years at the End of the Han Dynasty and during which the Cao family was rising, or risen, to prominence were known as the Jian'an era (196‚Äì220). The Jian'an was technically a Han dynasty Chinese era name referring approximately to the years 196‚Äì220, during the nominal reign of Emperor Xian of Han, during the End of the Han dynasty. The following major period is known as the Three Kingdoms era, due to the three kingdoms which succeeded the Han Dynasty, and proceeded to vie with one another for succession to the Han empire. These 3 successor states are Wei (also known as Cao Wei, 220‚Äì266), Shu, (also known as Shu Han, 221‚Äì263) and Wu (also known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, 229‚Äì280). The jian'an poetry merges with early the early Six Dynasty poetry of the early Three Kingdoms, both in terms of style and in some cases the actual poets, although the plague epidemic of 217‚Äì218 killed 4 of the 7 Masters of Jian'an,Watson, 48 and mortality rates were high otherwise, in some cases risk being associated with what someone wrote. Early Three Kingdoms poetry The Cao family from 184 to 220 was involved in the chaotic infighting between warlords, across various parts of China. In 220, Cao Pi founded the Wei, or Cao Wei dynasty (220 CE ‚Äì 266 CE). with its capital at Luoyang, in northern China. Its name came from 213, when Cao Cao's feudal holdings were given the name Wei; historians often add the prefix Cao (Êõπ, from Cao Cao's family name) to distinguish it from the other states in Chinese history also known as Wei. Twenty-four of Cao Cao's poems survive. Cao Cao and his son and successor to power, Cao Pi, were both noted as patrons of literature.Davis, vi Altogether the Cao family, especially Cao Cao's fourth son, Cao Zhi, in association with other poets helped to form the Jian'an style.Âª∫ÂÆâÈ¢®È™® Cao Zhi is also noted for his association with the dramatically composed and life-saving poem known as \\"The Quatrain of Seven Steps\\". Cao Pi wrote an essay Seven Scholars of Jian'an which was influential in the development of the Jian'an school of poetry. One of the poets patronized by Cao Cao and considered to be one of the \\"Seven Scholars of Jian'an\\" was Xu Gan (170‚Äì217).Davis, vi, who uses the alternative transliteration of Xu Gan's name as Hs√º Kan and translates the name of the literary group as 'the Seven Masters of the Chien-an period', and gives the years as 196‚Äì219. Another poet in this group was Wang Can (177‚Äì217). End of Cao Wei and founding of Jin The middle part of the Three Kingdoms period, from 220 and 263, was marked by a more politically and militarily stable arrangement between three rival states, Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of this period was marked by the collapse of the tripartite situation. First, in 263, there was the conquest of Shu by Wei. In the meantime the Cao family had been steadily losing power to the Sima family and their supporters, in a series of various intrigues and in-fighting. The Sima clan was initially subordinate to the Wei dynasty, but through various intrigues and other means the Sima family and their supporters had continued to gain power at the expense of the Cao family and their supporters. In February 266, Sima Yan (later Emperor Wu) forced emperor Cao Huan of Wei to abdicate the throne to him, ending Wei and starting the Jin Dynasty (as Emperor Wu). Political it was a perilous time, especially for Wei loyalists, who viewed the rise of the Sima clan as usurpers. Poetically, it was a time conducive to and encouraging the poetry of reclusion, as various poets sought refuge from the perils of the time, often finding it in settings involving nature, poetry, wine, and occasional friends. This often also explicitly or merely by implication tended towards somewhat of a poetry of protest. =Ruan Ji and the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove= The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (with boy attendant), in a Kano school Japanese painting of the Edo period Possible representation of Ruan Ji. Attributed to Sun Wei, second half of 9th century. As is traditionally depicted, the group wished to escape the intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life during the tail end of the politically fraught Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history and into the early period of the newly established Jin dynasty. According to tradition, the members, Liu Ling (221‚Äì300), Ruan Ji (210‚Äì263), Ruan Xian (fl. 3rd century), Xiang Xiu, Wang Rong (234‚Äì305) and Shan Tao (205‚Äì283) gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of Xi Kang (aka Ji Kang) (223‚Äì262), in Shanyang (now in Henan province) where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the simple, rustic life. Modern criticism suggests that these gatherings may have been to some extent virtual. Either way, this way of living was contrasted with the life of politics at court. The Seven Sages stressed the enjoyment of ale, personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of nature. The various 7 sages had their own specialties. However, they shared philosophical discussion, musical production, and drinking.Watson, 74 Burton Watson considers Ruan Ji (whose name he transcribes as Juan Chi) to be the \\"first important poet\\" following the Jian'an poetry style.Watson, 69 Ruan Ji helped to define the Six Dynasties poetic development of the themes of reclusion and friendship.Watson, 73 He helped to develop the five-character shi poetry form which had just newly developed with the Jian'an poets, but he moved it away from its initial starkly realistic descriptions of particular scenes which could be right before the poets' eyes towards more generalized, abstract, and symbolic poetic statement. Ruan Ji also developed the nature theme, focusing on \\"the passing of time and the cycle of the seasons\\", which lead towards the death of the individual. Ruan Ji was also used to deploy the imagery of birds as symbols of freedom and ability to escape their given situation. Burton Watson further notes the evident lack of the imagery of wine in Ruan's surviving poems. Not that he was unacquainted with it, even recorded as having remained continuously drunk for 2 months to avoid an undesirable marriage which was urged upon him with great political pressure such that he could not overtly refuse.Watson, 70 =Other early Jin poets= Counted as a Jin dynasty poet and official, Zhang Hua (232‚Äì300), was actually born before the creation of the Jin dynasty, however he flourished poetically during it, and died during it (as a result of the War of the Eight Princes). The general and prolific poet Lu Ji used Neo-Taoist cosmology to take literary theory in a new direction with his \\"Wen fu\\", or \\"Essay on Literature\\" in the fu poetic form. Jin dynasty The Jin dynasty was divided into an \\"eastern\\" and a \\"western\\" phase. Really, though, this may be less helpful of a description than saying that in terms of general geography the most apparent geographic difference between the first part and the second part of the Jin dynasty was the loss to the empire of the northern parts above the Huai River. However, historians often focus on the location of the capital on an east‚Äìwest axis. =Historical background= The Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) briefly unified the Chinese empire, in 280, but from 291 to 306 a multi-sided civil war known as the War of the Eight Princes raged through northern China, devastating that part of the country. For the first thirteen years this was a deadly violent and all-out struggle for power among at least eight princes and various dukes of Jin. Then in 304 CE the leader of the formerly independent ethnic nation of the Northern Xiongnu under its newly declared Grand Chanyu Liu Yuan (later Prince Han Zhao) declared independence, backed up with a large army which he fielded. Various other non-Chinese groups became involved, in what is known as the Wu Hu uprising, and by 316 the last Jin prince left standing, now as emperor, ruled an empire reduced to its former southern area. Thus, the history of the Jin dynasty can be divided in two parts, the first being Western Jin (265‚Äì316) and the second Eastern Jin (317‚Äì420). =Western Jin poetry= Poetry certainly occurred during Western Jin (265‚Äì316). Some of it is haunted by the social and political turmoils involved with the various changes of the times. Since the time span involved is about 50 years, many poets and trends in poetry transcend these somewhat arbitrary limits. =Eastern Jin poetry= Eastern Jin poetry includes work in the area known as the quasi-poetic literary form of fu. Sometimes fu is considered to be poetry, sometimes it is considered to be prose with poetic qualities. This rapprochement between prose and poetry is typical of late Six Dynasties literature, in general. Eventually, one of the enduring legacies of late Six Dynasties literature during the Tang dynasty at least would prove to be the reaction to the excesses which this sometimes indulged in. That is, until the late Tang, when similarly densely allusive literature again became in vogue. Anyway, in or around the period of the Eastern Jin dynasty (317‚Äì420), much poetic activity occurred, and this is sometimes referred to as \\"southern\\". The Orchid Pavilion Gathering The Orchid Pavilion Gathering as depicted in an 18th-century Japanese painting The Orchid Pavilion Gathering (353 CE) of 42 literati included Xie An and Sun Chuo at the Orchid Pavilion near Shaoxing, Zhejiang, during the Spring Purification Festival to compose poems and enjoy the wine. The gentlemen had engaged in a drinking contest: wine cups were floated down a small winding creek as the men sat along its banks; whenever a cup stopped, the man closest to the cup was required to empty it and write a poem. In the end, twenty-six of the participants composed thirty-seven poems. The \\"Preface (Lantingji Xu)\\" to the poems is particularly famous in regard to the art of calligraphy. Midnight Songs poetry Also significant is the Midnight Songs poetry also known as Ziye (Tzu-yeh) songs, or \\"Lady Midnight\\" style, supposedly originating with an eponymously named fourth-century professional singer of the Eastern Jin dynasty.Watson, 60 Included in this category of erotic poetry are both the early collection of specific pieces and pieces from the later genre which is stylistically based upon them. The original pieces are arranged in 4 parts, according to the four seasons; and, thus, later pieces accordingly show marked seasonal aspects. Tao Yuanming Detail from handscroll 'Scenes from the Life of Tao Yuanming', by Chen Hongshou, 1650, Honolulu Academy of Arts Tao Yuanming, also known as Tao Qian, lived from 365‚Äì427. Tao was one of the Six Dynasties' southern poets: born in the Eastern Jin dynasty, he lived on into the ensuing Liu Song dynasty. He was associated with the formation of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre. He was also a major exemplar of the poetry of reclusion. And, he is also especially noted for portraying immediate experience in the style of his own natural voice.Hinton, 110‚Äì112 Tao Qian was hired as an official by the Jin court, famously for the salary of five measures of rice; but, he famously quit, resigning in favor of a life of farming and poetry. Another of Tao's favorite activities (or at least the result thereof) was brewing his own homemade wine.Watson, 78 Of his poetry, Tao Yuanming has around 130 surviving poems. Xie Lingyun Xie Lingyun (385‚Äì433) was considered a progenitor and major exponent of nature or landscape poetry focusing on the \\"mountain and streams\\", as opposed to Tao Yuanming and the \\"field and garden\\" type of Chinese landscape poetry. His poetry is allusive and complex, and uses a lot of imagery of hills and nature. Fu and other East Jin poetry Other important Eastern Jin poets include the 2 heroes of Taikang Lu Ji (Shiheng) (261‚Äì303) and Pan Yue (247‚Äì300), Liu Kun (ÂäâÁê®), and Guo Pu (276‚Äì324), also Yan Yanzhi (È°èÂª∂‰πã, 384‚Äì456, so more often considered as Liu Song dynasty poet). Lu Ji is represented by his Wen fu. Pan Yue also wrote in the fu form, and is remembered for his 3 poems to his dead wife. Guo Pu was a prolific author whose works include prose, poetry, and fu. Sixteen Kingdoms poetry Su Hui with a palindrome The Sixteen Kingdoms were a collection of numerous short-lived sovereign states in northern China and its neighboring areas (304‚Äì439), founded after the Jin Dynasty lost the northern part of their territory and were confined to their former southern territory, thus chronologically overlapping the end of the Jin Dynasty and the actual establishment of the full Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 to 589). One noted poet of this era, somewhere in the fourth century, was Su Hui, a poet of the Former Qin state (351‚Äì394), which unified northern China, in 376. Typically, for female poets of this time and place in history, almost all of her literary works are lost.Hinton, 105‚Äì109 Her sole surviving piece is of the huiren shi (palindrome poem) genre. Northern and Southern dynasties poets The Southern dynasties (n√°nch√°o) comprise the Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen, this period follows the end of the Jin dynasty. The Northern Dynasties (bƒõich√°o) included Northern Wei (386‚Äì534), Eastern Wei (534‚Äì550), Western Wei (535‚Äì557), Northern Qi (550‚Äì577), and Northern Zhou(557‚Äì581 AD). Considered together, they are known as the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 to 589). This division between north and south involved various considerations: many of these being of a political and military nature, together with the natural geological barriers which run east‚Äìwest, especially the Yangzi River and the combination of the Huai River and the Qin Mountains (Q√≠n L«êng). Yu Xin is one of the few poets who can be associated with both the south and the north during this period. =Liu Song= The \\"Three Giants of Yuanjia\\" include Yan Yanzhi. =Yongming= The Yongming (Yung-ming) period was from 483‚Äì493.Davis, viii Yongming was an era name of Emperor Wu of Southern Qi. Several poets were associated with it. Wang Jung (468‚Äì494) was one of the most important of the Yongming poets. He became quite involved in political affairs. Eventually this involvement resulted in his early death.Davis, vii ‚Äì viii Fan Yun (451‚Äì503) was another of the Yongming poets. Su Xiaoxiao (ËòáÂ∞èÂ∞è, died c. 501), also known as Su Xiaojun, or \\"Little Su\\", was a famous courtesan and poet from Qiantang city (now Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China) in the Southern Qi Dynasty (479‚Äì502). =Liang dynasty and the jade terrace= The Liang Dynasty (502‚Äì557), also known as the Southern Liang Dynasty, was the third of the Southern dynasties. Founded by the Xiao family, its first emperor was Liang Wu Di. In 531, his son Xiao Gang (later Emperor Jianwen of Liang) became Crown Prince, in which position Xiao Gang both practiced poetry and became a patron of poets. Of this poetic activity, especially important is the anthology New Songs from the Jade Terrace, compiled by Xu Ling (507‚Äì83), under the patronage of Crown Prince Xiao Gang (Later known as Emperor Jianwen).Watson, 92, and following The \\"Jade Terrace\\" is at least in part a reference to the luxurious palace apartments to which upper-class women were often relegated, one of the main conventional images being that of a beautiful concubine languishing away in lonely confinement, bereft of love. The New Songs from the Jade Terrace has been popularly translated into English. The collection contains over 600 pieces focused on the ideals of feminine beauty, and some of the poems are matter-of-factly homoerotic, describing the beloved young man involved in much the same terms as the female beloved is in other pieces. In other cases, a \\"hint of fetishism\\" is shown in poetic verses describing the objects associated with the men or women described in the poems; that is, their bedrooms and feast halls, the musical instruments, lamps or mirror-stands which they handle, or the fine stationary upon which they write their love notes.Watson, 91‚Äì92 Influence The Six Dynasties period ended when China was reunified by the Sui Dynasty. In terms of poetic development, both the Sui Dynasty (589‚Äì618) early Tang poetry were both heavily indebted to the Six Dynasty poetry. Various influences of Six Dynasties poetry include both those in terms of formalistic style and in terms of content, such as historical references. Some of the importance of the Six Dynasty era to poetry includes poetry theory and aesthetic understanding. One example is Liu Xie's The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons.

G. Jolly (born 1 October 1926) is an Indian physician and Emeritus Professor of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. He is an internationally known expert in the field of blood transfusion, who pioneered the voluntary blood donation movement in India, and is regarded as the \\"Father of Transfusion Medicine in India\\". He spearheaded the campaign to prohibit sale and purchase of blood from professional donors in India, which was later incorporated into the National Blood Policy of India by the Government of India. He has generated awareness among the masses about the significance of blood donation programmes by observing \\"Blood Donation Day\\" on 1 October. This has helped in obtaining adequate quantity of quality blood from voluntary donors. His dedicated work has contributed magnificently to the development and excellence in professional service, research and teaching in the field of Transfusion Medicine in India. He was the founder of the Blood Bank Society, Chandigarh, founder President of Indian Society of Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology and made significant contributions to the development of Blood programme in India. As a result of his contributions, he represented India in numerous International Delegations as well as scientific conferences. During the course of these visits he got the opportunity of studying the blood transfusion programme in different parts of the world for revamping the organisational set up in India. On the completion of his assignment at the PGI, Chandigarh he joined SGPGI Lucknow to establish a department of excellence where he introduced postgraduate degrees in Transfusion Medicine for the first time in India. He then provided consultation to the Government Medical College, Chandiagrh. During the recent years, he has been concentrating his activities primarily towards the academic development of transfusion medicine and to provide free factors to haemophiliacs. He has also advocated \\"screening of parents and unborn babies for thalassaemia in India\\". He has emphasised the need for the provision of more and advanced facilities for the preparation of blood components in India. He has worked to meeting blood requirement during disasters. Being associated with the National and State Blood Transfusion Councils of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh he has continued his efforts in the development of Transfusion services in the region. He was also instrumental in setting up a department of Transfusion Medicine, having well established units for blood components at the newly established Government Medical College, Chandigarh. As an international expert on Blood Transfusion Medicine, he has reviewed Strategies for Safe Blood Transfusion for the World Health Organization, and has written over 100 scientific articles in international journals. As a result of his innumerable contributions in this field Dr. Jolly is recognised as the leader of blood banking in India. Among the numerous distinctions conferred on Dr. Jolly are the J. G. Mukherjee gold medal by the Lucknow University for distinguished research contribution (1958), Dr. B. C. Roy National Award for the development of the speciality of Blood Transfusion in India (1981), Philip Levine Memorial Award for national contributions in Transfusion Medicine (1993) and IDPL Diamond Jubilee IMA Oration Award (1996). He was also awarded by The Chandigarh Administration on the Republic Day of India for social service and illustrious achievements in the field of blood donation. The fact that the speciality of blood transfusion has begun to be recognised in India can be attributed to the sustained effort of Dr. Jolly. He has been accorded recognition by the World Health Organization, International Society of Blood Transfusion and World Federation of Hemophilia.

Its builders were the ancestors of the Tewa Pueblos who now (2011) reside in Santa Clara Pueblo and San Juan Pueblo. It has also been referred to informally as Turquoise Ruin, although there is no evidence that turquoise has ever been found in the area. Poshuouinge is situated upstream and due west of another Tewa Pueblo ancestral site, Tsama. Geography Poshuouinge was built on a high mesa, some above the Chama River, around 1400. There are two springs located about to the south of the ruins which are believed to have been the main water sources for the habitation. It is accessible by a United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service trail. This city, at its largest, consisted of about 700 ground floor rooms, most being two or even three stories tall. The city was laid out with two main plazas, and a large kiva near the center of the eastern courtyard. The barrow pits of Poshuouinge were planted with small stone grids in the basement. History The city is believed to have been occupied between 1375 and 1475. The site was abandoned around 1500, well before Coronado and the first Europeans arrived.

The actor successfully auditioned for the six-week recurring role of Kyle and he made his first on screen appearance on 26 November 2008. Milligan was later asked back every couple of months to do a few weeks filming. After eighteen months of playing Kyle on a part-time basis, Milligan was given a full-time contract deal and he and his character were promoted to the regular cast. Milligan said he was ecstatic about his promotion and looked forward to developing his character further. In August 2011, Milligan had to be written out of Neighbours temporarily, so he could recover from an injury he sustained off screen. Milligan chose to leave Neighbours in 2015 and Kyle departed on 8 April 2016. He made a brief return from 15 to 20 September 2016, and returned as a regular character from 2 April 2019. Kyle was initially portrayed as an immature bad boy, whose physical presence made him fall into the role of a bully. However, his low academic intelligence made him vulnerable to people smarter than himself. A traumatic accident and his struggle to secure employment changed Kyle's ways. The character has been described as a larrikin, good hearted and laid back. Following his promotion to the regular cast, the show's writers gave Kyle some character traits similar to Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan). Like Henry, Kyle becomes the handyman of Ramsay Street and he later opens his own business, which brings him into contact with many of the street's residents. Kyle's storylines have often focused on his various relationships and jobs. Kyle engaged in a brief relationship with Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) and developed a crush on Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He later entered into a casual relationship with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), which turned serious. Following Jade's departure, Kyle began dating Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele). Other storylines for Kyle have seen him blackmailed by a corrupt police officer and temporarily damaging his eyesight by looking at the sun during an eclipse. The character has been well received by critics and Milligan was nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards in 2012 and 2014. Casting On 20 October 2008, a reporter for The Courier-Mail announced Milligan had landed a recurring role on Neighbours. The actor won the part of Kyle following a successful audition. Milligan said securing the role had made moving away from his family and relocating to Melbourne worth the sacrifice. He made his first screen appearance as Kyle on 26 November 2008. In March 2011, Milligan revealed to TV Week that he initially had a six- week guest role as Kyle, but he was then asked back every couple of months for a few weeks filming. After eighteen months of playing Kyle on a part-time basis, Milligan was promoted to the regular cast and given a full-time contract deal. His promotion came as the show lost two male cast members; Erin Mullally and Scott McGregor. Milligan told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he was \\"ecstatic\\" when he heard about his promotion and quipped \\"Kyle had been a guest character for nearly three years so it's great to be full-time now and to be able to evolve the character.\\" On 9 August 2011, Milligan snapped his Achilles tendon while playing football and had to be written out of the soap. The actor took a break from Neighbours for around five weeks and the writers were forced to rewrite scenes which featured his character. Executive producer Susan Bower said \\"We've rewritten some scenes which explain Kyle's absence, and as a former nurse, I'll be monitoring his rehabilitation.\\" A few days later, it was announced Luke Pegler had joined the cast to fill in for Milligan and take over a planned storyline for his character. On 13 September 2011, a Channel 5 writer reported Milligan had returned to the set in time to film the final episodes of the 2011 season. Milligan was still using crutches and a writer for the Herald Sun said his injury would be worked into his storylines. Of his return, Milligan said \\"After a month of virtually sitting on the couch, I'm rapt to be back at work. I just have to pace myself a bit.\\" Development =Characterisation= When Kyle first joined Neighbours, he was an immature \\"bad boy\\", who often hung around with school bullies, Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey) and Shane Gregory (Ryan Bate). Channel 5 said Kyle's physical presence made him fall easily into the role of a bully and eventual group leader, but his low academic intelligence made him vulnerable to people smarter than himself. Following a traumatic rafting accident on a school trip and his struggle to find employment, Kyle decided to change as he did not want to be the same person anymore. Milligan said his character had a \\"good heart\\" and that he was forced to learn things for himself, as he had not had the right people around to show him the way. Kyle has been described as being a \\"trouble maker\\", a larrikin and \\"loveable-but-slightly-hopeless.\\" The official Neighbours website said Kyle was the \\"local hottie\\", who was hard to take seriously, though his heart was in the right place. Kyle was also a \\"good-time guy\\", who developed a thirst for adventure. Shortly before Kyle's promotion to regular character was announced, TV Soap reported the Neighbours writers were going to give Kyle some Henry Ramsay-like traits. Of this, executive producer Susan Bower explained \\"He was at school with the gang and he's been back and forwards quite a lot, and we certainly feel that he has a future for the show - in much the same way as Henry Ramsay was sort of the handyman around the place. We've got some good plans for him.\\" Kyle has been employed at both Charlie's and Erinsborough Motors, but he had dreams of opening his own handyman business. During an interview with Digital Spy in June 2011, Milligan revealed Kyle would eventually start his own handyman business, which would bring him into contact with all of the Ramsay Street residents. Kyle later became involved in a storyline that saw his business threatened by the development of a new shopping complex. Milligan said Kyle was \\"pretty laid- back\\" and would become an unexpected friend to some of the characters. In August 2011, Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, that Kyle was a guy with double standards, who \\"goes out and shags indiscriminately, but the girl he wants to marry has to be an angel.\\" She revealed the writers were going to challenge this aspect of the character. =Family= In May 2011, Milligan stated that it would be fun to see some of Kyle's friends and family introduced to the soap. Following an injury in early August, Milligan was forced to take a break from filming and Luke Pegler was brought in and cast as Dane Canning, Kyle's cousin. Dane arrives in Erinsborough to take over Kyle's room at Number 26 and look after his business, while he goes to care for his sick mother. Dane and Kyle have similar personalities and Pegler revealed that he spoke to Milligan about finding \\"some common ground\\" for their characters. Pegler stated that Dane and Kyle come from the same place and have developed the same habits. He quipped that they both have \\"bravado\\", while being softies underneath. Pegler later commented that Dane has \\"Canning DNA\\" and is just as oblivious to things around him as Kyle is. Milligan hoped that Pegler would return as Kyle's cousin as he was \\"fantastic to work with\\" and his character was popular with viewers. He added \\"Now the Canning family is expanding, hopefully that will include a cousin or two coming to stay.\\" In January 2012, new executive producer Richard Jasek revealed that Kyle's grandmother was being cast and it was later announced that Colette Mann had received the role of Sheila Canning. Sheila comes to Erinsborough to make a surprise visit to Kyle, but after she meets his neighbours and begins to like the life he has, she decides to \\"stick around to keep an eye on her beloved grandson.\\" Of Kyle's relationship with his grandmother, Milligan told a What's on TV writer \\"The Cannings are a very close, working-class family and his gran rules the roost. He adores her, but also knows that he needs to keep a tight rein on her when it comes to him making his own decisions. She is also quick to judge people.\\" Milligan said that Sheila does not approve of his relationship with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita) as she perceives her \\"independence as arrogance\\". Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported that Sheila adores her grandson and would do anything for him, which rubs Jade up the wrong way. She added \\"It's going to be a very tricky time for Kyle as he tries to please them both.\\" The Canning family was expanded again in late 2012 with the introduction of Kyle's cousin Harley (Justin Holborow). A Channel 5 website writer stated that Harley shares the same good looks as Kyle, but he does not share the same moral compass. Harley turns up in Ramsay Street in the back of a police car, which shocks Kyle. However, in a bid to show how responsible he has become, Kyle decides to take Harley in. He then learns that Harley has been in trouble with the law before and becomes determined to help him. Hill wrote \\"He realises someone needs to step in to straighten out Harley. But viewers will be left wondering whether Kyle has taken on too much.\\" =Relationships= Kate Ramsay In January 2010, Kyle goes on a date with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Kyle asks Kate whether she accepted his offer because she is trying to make Declan Napier (James Sorensen) jealous, but Kate denies it and tells Kyle she wants to get to know him better. Declan is not happy and when he sees Kate and Kyle together and he sabotages the date. In May 2011, Milligan revealed Kyle has always liked Kate because she is nice and is unlike the other girls he has dated in the past. Milligan said while Kyle like her, he would never push Kate into liking him. When Kyle sees Kate has been hurt by her ex-boyfriend, Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor), he feels protective towards her. Kyle worries about competing with Mark for Kate's affections, as he is not as intelligent and successful as him. Kyle also knows Kate is very smart, which further dents his confidence. When Mark learns Kyle is interested in Kate, he asks her out, but is later forced to postpone the date. Kyle decides to take advantage of the situation and invites Kate to spend the evening watching films with him. Kate accepts and enjoys the time she spends with Kyle. Mark later accuses Kate of trying to make him jealous and Kate decides to put him behind her, by agreeing to go on an official date with Kyle. When asked who he thought the right woman for Kyle is, Milligan said \\"That's a hard one. He and Kate would make a nice couple, but I think he needs someone who is going to challenge him.\\" Natasha Williams Following her split from Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith), Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) starts dating Kyle. The following month, she decides to dump him, but to her surprise, Kyle gets there first. TV Soap explained Natasha grows bored of Kyle's company, but Kyle also becomes bored with his younger girlfriend and he \\"wastes no time severing their ties.\\" Kyle's actions embarrass Natasha and he agrees to let her pretend that she dumped him. She then lies to Andrew that \\"she's kicked Kyle to the curb\\", instead of the other way around. Kyle fell in love with his housemate Jade Mitchell (played by Gemma Pranita). Jade Mitchell When asked who she would like to see her character, Jade Mitchell, find love with, Gemma Pranita suggested Kyle. Pranita thought Jade and Kyle's \\"contrasting personalities\\" would work together if they entered a relationship. She explained \\"I think the characters can learn a lot from each other. Jade is very worldly and smart and Kyle has a more simple and uncomplicated nature.\\" Kyle and Jade share a house together and on the night of their housewarming party they kiss, which thrills Jade. However, Kyle still sees her as a friend. Kyle and Jade later have sex together and Kyle suggests they engage in a friends with benefits arrangement, to which Jade agrees. During a feature on soap couples that should be together, Inside Soap said Kyle should give up lusting after Kate and realise Jade is \\"The One\\". The magazine opined that while neither of them has had a relationship for more than twenty-four hours, it does put them on an even playing field. When Jade was given a chance to work in the United States, she and Kyle began a long-distance relationship. Upon her return to Erinsborough, Jade invited Kyle to accompany her back to the US. However, after learning that Jade would be away for a year, Kyle made it clear that his life was in Erinsborough. A devastated Kyle then decided to break up with Jade, even though he still loved her. Georgia Brooks When Kyle supported Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) through a tough time at work, she began to question her relationship and future with Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich). When Georgia decided to spend the afternoon at a fundraising barbecue with Kyle, instead of being with Scotty she felt guilty. Hampele said Kyle was a distraction for Georgia. When Georgia has a good time at the fundraiser, she realised there was an attraction. When Georgia made a quick exit from the fundraiser, Kyle got confused and thought she had developed a crush on his house mate Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Believing that her feelings for Rhys would lead her to have her heart broken, Kyle urged Georgia to stay with Scotty. Hampele quipped that Georgia liked Kyle and thought he felt the same way, so it came as \\"a blow to her\\" when he pushed her away. Georgia and Kyle continued to hide their feelings for each other and Kyle dated Jana Noviac (Kyrie Capri). Milligan commented that Kyle did not go out looking for Jana, but she sort of appeared and made Georgia jealous. Georgia later ended her relationship with Scotty. When asked if Kyle would \\"step up to the plate\\", Milligan stated \\"I think he's almost scared by his feelings for Georgia. He's one of those guys that when he gets a girl he thinks is right, he wants to marry her.\\" When Kyle came to Georgia's place to fix the pool, she offered to put some sunscreen on his back and TV Week's Thomas Mitchell declared that \\"the electricity is off the grid!\\". However, Georgia's aunt, Angie (Lesley Baker), interrupted them. Georgia got back together with Scotty and they became engaged. However, when Kyle learned that Scotty had made sexual advances towards Chris Pappas (James Mason), he told Georgia the truth and Scotty left town. Milligan told an Inside Soap writer that Kyle had \\"a knack for finding the most complicated girls.\\" Kyle and Georgia eventually began dating when Kyle helped Georgia clear her name after she was accused of stealing drugs from the hospital. When they believed their relationship was in a good place, Kyle and Georgia had sex with each other for the first time. =Blackmail= When Kyle decides to hold a sale at the car yard to bring in extra revenue, it attracts the attention of Constable Wes Holland (Daniel Hamill). Wes demands money from Kyle in return for providing security for the event. Kyle is stunned and Milligan told Inside Soap that he does not know how to react. The actor explained \\"Holland makes it clear that if Kyle doesn't pay up, big trouble will come his way - and how do you respond to that?\\" Kyle is shaken up by the confrontation with Wes and he turns to Kate, who advises him to speak to Mark. Kyle is reluctant because of his history with the detective. However, when Kyle returns to the car yard to remove the sale signs, he gets another visit from Wes. The officer gets physical with Kyle and threatens to destroy his stock. Kyle then decides to go to Mark for help. Kyle explains the situation to Mark, but the story is not very believable. Milligan said \\"At first it isn't easy for them to work together because it's hard for Kyle to seek help off someone he's already had problems with, and he knows how Brennan feels about him - plus it's another cop, so he isn't convinced that Brennan will believe him.\\" Mark is under the impression Wes is a trusted colleague, so he decides to get proof before he believes Kyle. Mark finds the evidence he needs and he and Kyle confront Wes. When asked if the situation would be a turning point for Kyle and Mark, Milligan said that it was. He added while they would not become best friends, they would not be enemies either. =Temporary blindness= During a solar eclipse, Kyle looked up at the sun, which caused him to go temporarily blind. While enjoying a spa with Georgia, Kyle's dog, Bossy, stole his safety glasses and he decided to look directly at the eclipse. Kyle damaged his retinas and Georgia quickly rushed him to the hospital, where he was told that he had to wear eye patches. Kyle was then forced to rely on those around him, causing him to become frustrated. When Kyle started to miss his independence, his housemate, Chris invited him down to the car yard to help out. Milligan explained \\"He needs to get out of the house. Everyone is on his case trying to help him out, but Kyle pushes them away. Chris invites him down to the car yard, and Kyle will take anything to get out of that little bubble. Chris is being a good mate and trying to offer Kyle something to do. But even Chris gets to a point where he tells Kyle he needs to rest.\\" Realising Chris does not want him around, Kyle stormed off and put himself in danger by walking onto a busy intersection and into the path of an oncoming car. Chris managed to rescue Kyle in time and dragged him back to the pavement. =Departure and return= In April 2015, Milligan's co-star and partner Jenna Rosenow told Noel Murphy of The Weekly Review that she and Milligan were set to leave Neighbours later that year to pursue careers in Los Angeles. In March 2016, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) confirmed Milligan had left the show and added that Kyle would be on-screen for \\"a few more weeks.\\" Kilkelly also reported that Milligan filmed his final scenes at the end of 2015. Kyle made his final appearance on 8 April 2016. His exit storyline saw him reunite with Georgia, before being caught up in an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel. After surviving the disaster, Kyle decides to \\"put his own happiness first\\" and leaves Ramsay Street with Georgia, who has secured a nursing job in Europe. Kyle made a brief return from 15 September 2016. Milligan said that he always knew he would come back to finish Kyle's storyline off properly, before making the move to Los Angeles permanent. Kyle returns to Erinsborough for Sheila's 60th birthday, and to check that his father is \\"doing the right thing\\" by his sister. Xanthe is the first to realise that Kyle is back, after some of Sheila's gnomes go missing and she sets a trap for the thief. Sheila is delighted to see Kyle and have her family together again, but he is not pleased to see that Gary has been released from prison and welcomed back. After speaking with Toadie, Kyle is prepared to give his father a second chance. When Sheila asks him how long he is planning on staying for, Kyle makes it clear that he wants to leave before Amy returns. However, Kyle and Amy later come face to face, and she ends up \\"lashing out\\" at Kyle because he does not acknowledge how much he hurt her and Jimmy by leaving. Amy decides to move out of the Canning house, leading Jimmy to confront Kyle for disrupting their lives. =Reintroduction= Milligan later reprised the role full time, and he returned during the episode broadcast on 2 April 2019. Kyle returns to Erinsborough and interrupts his father proposing to his former girlfriend Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Cramond described the moment as \\"weird\\" and explained, \\"Kyle turns up out of the blue. No one knows he is coming, even Sheila ‚Äì who usually knows everything! Amy can tell that something is going on.\\" Kyle reveals that he has returned as Paul has offered him Amy's former job of overseeing the Robinson Pines housing development, which means they will have to work together during a handover period. Gary suspects that Paul wants to try and get Kyle and Amy back together, and Amy does not believe her father when he tells her that is not the case. Kyle also explains that he and Georgia have separated. Storylines =2008‚Äì2016= Shortly after moving to Erinsborough, Kyle befriends school bullies Justin Hunter and Shane Gregory.

Reception A writer for Holy Soap said Kyle's most memorable moment was \\"When he thought he had killed Zeke in the raft race disaster.\\" Of Kyle's early appearances, Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap observed \\"He's single, good-looking and employed ‚Äì plus he's got his own wheels. What more could a woman want from a fella?\\" A What's on TV reporter called Kyle a \\"lovable troublemaker\\", while a Channel 5 writer thought he was a \\"cheeky chappy.\\" A reporter from the Daily Record called Kyle a \\"wannabe- Romeo\\" during his pursuit of Kate. Another reporter said he was a \\"lovable idiot\\", which made him irresistible to Jade. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap wondered how long Kyle and Jade's friends with benefits deal would last until they saw what the rest of the world could. In October 2011, another reporter from the Daily Record praised Kyle's promotion to regular cast member, saying \\"whoever decided to bring him in on a permanent basis deserves a big pat on the back.\\" The reporter added that Kyle had been a breath of fresh air ever since he moved into Ramsay Street. Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun called Jade and Kyle's relationship \\"bumpy\\" and he praised Milligan for not letting his torn Achilles stop his character from hobbling around on crutches. In 2012, Milligan was nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. He received a nomination in the same category in 2014.

It operated under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Detroit.  History  = Initial attempt = When Father Louis Van Straelan arrived in 1879 as the new pastor he recognized the need for a Catholic school in the community. In September 1882 Sacred Heart opened its new schoolhouse to twelve students in grades one through eight. Father Van Straelan expected any pastor that followed him would continue his efforts, and that the school would grow with the community. Unfortunately when he was transferred the decision was to not replace him with a resident pastor. His departure ended his school program. = Second attempt = In 1918 another new pastor, Father Dennis P. Tighe, also recognized the educational needs of the community. He immediately had the church basement divided into classrooms, and hired three lay instructors. In 1920 he received permission to construct a new school, and contacted the Mother Superior of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM) for permission to have three nuns teach at the new school. In 1921, with the construction of the school building complete, the nuns began teaching 130 students in grades 1 through 8. The Archdiocese of Detroit Archives, and the IHM chronicles seem to accept 1921 as the date Sacred Heart School was established. In 1928 a ninth grade was added, in 1930 and 1931 10th and 11th grades were added respectively. The school remained at grades 1 through 11 until 1936 when the impact of global depression forced the elimination of the secondary (high school) grades. By the mid 1950s the economy and confidence in it had recovered enough that by 1955 enrollment in the elementary grades had grown to over 1,100 students. Ground was broken for a new high school and ninth grade classes began in September 1955. The school added grades 10, 11, and 12 over the next 3 years to accommodate the advancing students. Sacred Heart High School remained open until 1971 when mounting debt, and the passing of the pastor, Rev. Raymond Clancy, forced the parish to close the school at the end of the 1970-71 school year.

With approximately $24 billion in annual revenue, US Foods was the 10th largest private company in America until its IPO. Many of the entities that make up US Foods were founded in the 19th century, including one that sold provisions to travelers heading west during the 1850s gold rush. The company used the name U.S. Foodservice until 1993. US Foods offers more than 350,000 national brand products and its own ‚Äúexclusive brand‚Äù items, ranging from fresh meats and produce to prepackaged and frozen foods. The company employs approximately 25,200 people in more than 60 locations nationwide, and provides food and related products to more than 250,000 customers, including independent and multi-unit restaurants, healthcare and hospitality entities, government and educational institutions. The company is headquartered in Rosemont, Illinois, and is a publicly held company trading under the ticker symbol USFD on the New York Stock Exchange. On 9 December 2013, Sysco Corp announced it would buy US Foods for $8.2 billion ($3.5 billion plus $4.7 billion of debt),\\"Sysco to buy US Foods for $8.2 bln including debt\\", Reuters, December 9, 2013. but on June 24, 2015, US Federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the combined Sysco-US Foods would control 75% of the U.S. foodservice industry and that would stifle competition. On June 29, 2015, Sysco terminated its merger with US Foods. History =Early history= Several of the entities that comprised what is now US Foods started in the 19th century. Monarch Foods, for example, traced its roots to Reid-Murdoch Co., a Dubuque, Iowa, company founded in 1853 to provision wagon trains heading west. Reid-Murdoch was a major sponsor of The Teenie Weenies comic strip. John Sexton & Company began as a retail tea and coffee merchant in Chicago, Illinois in 1883. John Sexton soon discovered hotels and restaurants were his biggest customers. By 1887, Sexton closed his four Chicago retail locations to focus on his institutional customers. By 1891, Sexton began manufacturing private label pickles, salad dressings, preserves, and jellies as well as roasting coffee in downtown Chicago. In addition, Sexton established a food testing laboratory to guarantee that his products had a uniform high level of quality. He also developed an extensive national institutional sales force in all major metropolitan areas, and a catalog mail order grocery business. All national orders were shipped via rail or parcel post from Sexton's Chicago warehouse. Chicago deliveries were by Sexton horse and wagon fleet, and, after 1924, Sexton electric and diesel truck fleets. By 1930, Sexton dropped the catalog mail order business and concentrated on the institutional customers throughout the United States. In 1933, Sexton opened a warehouse and truck fleet in Brooklyn, New York to support the New York Sexton sales force. By 1949, John Sexton & Co. was operating branch warehouses and truck fleets in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Long Island City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to support the Sexton national salesforce. In 1962, John Sexton & Co. was listed as a public company on the Over the Counter Stock Market with $79 million in sales and $2 million in profits. In 1968, John Sexton & Co. had $90 million in sales, which represented 5% of the total institutional foodservice industry. In 1968, Sexton warehouses and truck fleets were located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco with a regional salesforce covering the majority of the United States. This gave Sexton a coast to coast distribution and sales network to service their 79,000 customers. In late 1968, John Sexton & Co. was purchased by Beatrice Foods for $37.5 million in Beatrice preferred shares and assumption of Sexton debt.\\"Beatrice: From Buildup to Breakup, Gazel, Neil (1990) Beatrice Foods operated Sexton as an independent division until 1983, when Beatrice sold Sexton to S.E.

M. Irwin. The partnership took over the small provision-pushcart business of Samuel Irwin, a civil war vet. who had lost his arm in the Battle of Winchester, Virginia. Parke started as a seller of coffee, tea and spices. The company grew to be a major institutional wholesale seller of canned goods and had five locations (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, DC, Albany, New York and Richmond, VA) by the time it sold out to Consolidated Foods in 1962. Donald Irwin Jr., President of Parke, became the first president of Monarch Institutional Foods at that time. Los Angeles-based S.E. Rykoff & Co. was established in 1911, and the Mazo and Lerch families started their business in Northern Virginia in 1927. Most of these wholesalers tended to specialize, selling items to local grocery stores. In the early 1930s, distributors, including Mazo-Lerch Company, began offering frozen foods, primarily frozen french fries and orange juice. =Post-World War II= Foodservice distributors served institutional clients that provided food away from home, unlike retail distributors, who sold to grocery stores. The first distinction between the two groups came about in 1951, with the formation of the Association of Institutional Distributors. With fighting going on in Korea, the federal government reinstituted price controls, including a 16 percent ceiling on food distributors' gross profits. About a dozen companies met in Chicago to respond to that action. Because it cost more to distribute to their institutional customers than to grocery stores, the distributors wanted to be considered separately from grocery wholesalers and to have their ceiling raised to at least 21 percent. They were successful in their lobbying efforts. The federal government also helped open up foodservice markets. Five years earlier, in 1946, the U.S. Congress passed the National School Lunch Act. Suddenly, large numbers of schoolchildren were eating cooked meals away from home, and school cafeterias became the first institutional mass market. One of the few distributors to focus on schools was the Pearce-Young-Angel Company (PYA) in the Carolinas. That same year, Consolidated Foods Corp., the precursor of Sara Lee Corporation, acquired Monarch Foods. By the late 1950s, most distributors had added frozen foods to their product lines. In 1958, Mazo-Lerch held the first food show, and was one of the first distributors to offer both custom-cut meats and beverage dispenser programs. The diversification trend continued over the years, as foodservice distributors provided disposable items such as paper napkins and tablecloths, followed by china and glassware, then light and heavy equipment. =The 1960s= In 1965, Americans spent just 20 cents of every food dollar for food away from home. Total distributor sales that year were an estimated $9 billion, and the average institutional distributor had an annual volume of $1.5-$2 billion. Institutional Distributor, in its first survey of the foodservice distribution industry, found that the average order size of respondents was $80.40, and the average number of customers was 572. The survey also found that nearly half of the respondents sold to both grocery and institutional customers. In 1962, John Sexton & Company went public and its shares traded on the Over the Counter Stock Market (NASDAQ) with $79 million in sales and $2 million in profits. =The 1970s= The decade of the 1970s saw the move to broadline, multi-branch organizations. Consolidated Foods bought the old Pearce-Young- Angel distribution network in 1971 and merged it with its Monarch Foods subsidiary to form PYA/Monarch. Sysco was established in 1970 by combining five independent wholesale grocery companies. Sysco went public in 1970 with $115 million in annual sales and shares were traded on the NYSE. Continental Coffee Company established in 1915 by the Cohn family (CFS Continental) went public in 1970. S.E.

Retrieved 8 February 2011. =The 1980s= The distribution industry went through a difficult period during the early 1980s, with companies under pressure as a result of inflation and economic slowdown. However, people still needed to eat, and much of the pressure was from competition. Speakers at national conferences focused on customer service, productivity, and professional development. Computers were playing a greater role in the business, enabling a distributor to provide customers with information to help control inventory, determine menu costs, and analyze profitability. As distributors became more professional, restaurant chains such as Marriott and Howard Johnson folded or reduced their self-distribution activities and focused on their restaurant operations. By 1982, institutional foodservice distribution was a $69 billion industry. The five companies considered \\"national distributors\\" were PYA/Monarch, John Sexton & Company,($360 million in sales) a division of Beatrice Foods, Sysco Corporation of Houston ($1 billion in sales), CFS Continental, Inc. ($1 billion in sales), and Kraft Foodservice. The five companies had a total of 168 distribution centers covering major portions of the country. Despite the geographical dominance, these five multi-branch distributors reported combined sales in 1982 of $4.8 billion ‚Äì 7 percent of the total foodservice industry. Over the next several years, the big distributors made major acquisitions. S.E. Rykoff & Co bought John Sexton & Company in 1983 for $84.5 million from Beatrice Foods, in what was then the largest acquisition in the industry. The renamed Rykoff-Sexton took fourth place among foodservice distributors with $800 million in sales. CFS Continental, Inc. purchase of Publix Fruit and Produce moved it into third place, with sales in the $1.1 billion range. Number one Sysco acquired B.A. Railton along with Pegler, increasing its volume to over $2 billion. Meanwhile, in Greenville, South Carolina, number two PYA/Monarch bought Fleming Foodservice of Austin, Texas, raising its 1984 sales volume to an estimated $1.3 billion. By the end of its fiscal year in June 1984, PYA/Monarch was serving some 70,000 foodservice operators, and its 22 distribution centers blanketed 60 percent of the United States. PYA/Monarch was one of the first distributors to compete as a provider of services as well as products. \\"The day of the distributor who merely warehouses, delivers, and takes orders for products a customer wants is over,\\" company management told Institutional Distribution in a 1984 article. PYA/Monarch's mission statement revealed its goal: \\"...to be a premier company in every area of operations, providing products and services that can enable a customer to run a more efficient and profitable business.\\" Using the largest computer in the industry, PYA/Monarch phased in a new state-of-the-art data processing system. Totally centralized, the system made it possible for headquarters to carry out data processing for each of the 22 branches, whose computers now gathered data. The 1980s saw a tremendous change in the eating habits in the United States. By 1986, Americans were spending one-third of every food dollar outside the supermarket, and the foodservice distribution had grown to a $78 billion industry. By April 1989, Sara Lee Corporation had decided to sell off the northern division of PYA/Monarch, citing dissatisfaction with its performance. Although the southeast division was the top food distributor in its region, overall PYA/Monarch ranked third behind Sysco and Kraft, and Sara Lee was committed to being first or second in each of its businesses. In June 1989, members of PYA/Monarch management incorporated a new entity, JPF Holdings, Inc. Two weeks later, on July 3, JPF Holdings acquired all the capital stock of the Sara Lee subsidiary, JP Foodservice Distributors Inc, including the mid-Atlantic and northeastern operations of PYA/Monarch Inc. Under the terms of the leveraged buyout, Sara Lee retained ownership of PYA/Monarch, now operating in the southeast, as well as 47 percent of the shares in JP Foodservice. Headed by James L. Miller, who had been executive vice-president of PYA/Monarch's northern division, the new company immediately sold three of its branches ‚Äì Los Angeles, Little Rock, and Paducah ‚Äì to Kraft Foodservice. The result was a major regional operation with nine distribution centers serving a territory from Virginia north to Maine and west to Nebraska. JP Foodservice Distributors passed the $1 billion mark in its first year, with sales for fiscal 1990 of $1.02 billion. That was a jump of more than 12 percent from the division's sales in fiscal 1989, and made the new company number five among the top 50 distributors selected by Institutional Distributor. But Miller and the other managers had borrowed over 95 percent of the $317 million they paid for the company. With that amount of debt, and with a soft economy, JP concentrated on building the lowest cost structure in the industry. The company invested primarily in improving facilities, adding a new $15 million replacement center between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and building an addition at its Allentown, Pennsylvania warehouse that doubled freezer and cooler capacity. It also used technology to cut costs and provide greater service to its customers. For example, a hand-held electronic device allowed JP customers to monitor their inventory and send information to the company. =The 1990s= In November 1994, five years after it was created, the company adopted the name JP Foodservice, Inc. and went public in November, listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol JPFS. Sara Lee Corporation now held 37 percent of JP common stock. The public offering raised $86 million, and JP restructured and paid off much of its debt. JP Foodservice had more than 21,000 customers in 25 states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Northeast regions of the country and was the sixth largest food distributor. It provided customers with a broad line of products, including canned, dry, frozen, and fresh foods, paper products, detergents, and light restaurant equipment. With its debt problems resolved, the company set a new growth strategy which, in addition to increasing internal growth, included acquiring smaller distributors. Its first purchases were Tri River Foods, Inc. and Rotelle Inc., two Pennsylvania distributors. JP's strategy also called for increasing its line of private label products, which included Hilltop Hearth breads, Cattlemen's Choice meats, and Roseli Italian foods. Foodservice distribution had grown to become a $124 billion industry, and the ten largest distributors accounted for 18 percent of the business. JP's business, which for fiscal 1995 reached $1.12 billion, was about 55 percent independent (hospital cafeterias, family-owned restaurants) and 45 percent chains. The increasing product demands and bigger menus of the chains and large restaurants were important factors fueling consolidation among distributors. Toward the end of 1995, the company and its former parent, Sara Lee Corporation, began talks about exchanging PYA/Monarch, Sara Lee's southeastern foodservice subsidiary, for JP stock worth about $946 million. Yet, the two companies failed to reach agreement on several factors, including valuation (JP's stock price had gone up in expectation of the merger), structure, and dilution of earnings to existing shareholders, and the deal fell through in February 1996. The experience left both sides bitter, and JP was expected to find a way to reduce Sara Lee's presence or end its investment in the company all together. That separation occurred before the end of 1996, when JP held a public offering involving the sale of all the common stock held by Sara Lee. On December 31, 1996, JP Foodservice moved to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol JPF. JP continued buying smaller companies, paying for them with $66 million raised by another stock offering. Acquisitions included Valley Industries of Las Vegas, Arrow Paper and Supply Company, based in Connecticut, Squeri Food Service of Cincinnati, and Mazo-Lerch Company, Inc., the 70-year- old food distributor based in northern Virginia that had held the first food fair in 1953. By the end of the fiscal year in June, net sales were up 17 percent to $1.7 billion, with acquisitions accounting for about six percent of the increase and the remaining 11 percent from internal growth. JP's growth was significantly higher than the three percent for the foodservice distribution industry. The JP Foodservice company credited its internal growth to sales training and promotions and to the expansion of its private and signature brands. U.S. Foodservice The name \\"US Foodservice\\" comes from United Signature Foods, Inc., a broadline distributor based in Wilkes- Barre, PA. US Foodservice Inc was formed in March 1992 by Unifax Inc specifically to acquire the White Swan Inc, a Dallas-based distributor. The merger with White Swan Inc was completed in October 1993. Via a share exchange (shares of White Swan were swapped for shares of US Foodservice), it created one of the largest broadline distributors in the country. The resulting combined entity had five operating subsidiaries: White Swan, Bevaco Food Service, Kings Foodservice Inc., Roanoke Restaurant Service and Biggers Brothers Inc, thus operating foodservice distribution centers in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Ohio, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Florida. Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., owned a controlling ownership in both White Swan and US Foodservice, by virtue of its funding each company's leveraged buyouts ‚Äì White Swan in 1988 and Unifax Inc in 1992. The US Foodservice management team will include Frank Bevevino, president and chief executive; Thomas G. McMullen and Peter Smith, vice presidents; David F. McAnally, vice president and chief financial officer; and William Griffin, vice president of administration. In 1995, US Foodservice of Wilkes Barre, PA was the 4th largest broadline foodservice distributor, according to Institutional Distributor Magazine, behind Sysco (#1), S.E. Rykoff/John Sexton (d.b.a. Rykoff-Sexton) (#2), and Kraft Foodservice (#3), and just ahead of JP Foodservice (#5), and PYA/Monarch (#6). Within the next 12-24 months, S.E. Rykoff/John Sexton would establish a solid hold of this #2 spot by acquiring Continental Foods of Baltimore, MD, H&O; Foods of Las Vegas, NV, and US Foodservice. Rykoff-Sexton management created the Rykoff-Sexton Funding Corporation to finance the acquisition of their near competitor US Foodservice, and by the end of 1996 the newly renamed and much larger corporation was now trading on the New York Exchange as Rykoff-Sexton Inc. US Foodservice had now become a division of Rykoff-Sexton Inc. The Rykoff-Sexton Inc. parent corporation was now operating a handful of divisions, a broadline foodservice distribution division (d.b.a. \\"US Foodservice\\" after combining with the S.E. Rykoff and John Sexton & Co distribution divisions), a private label manufacturing division (historical foodservice brands like John Sexton and SERCO), a foodservice contract and design division (historically known as Finegolds), and foodservice equipment and supply (second in size at the time to only Edward Don & Company). Rykoff- Sexton Inc management was not done yet; negotiations were already underway in 1997 to combine with JP Foodservice. Mark Van Stekelenburg, then chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Rykoff-Sexton Inc, and the former president and chief executive officer of G.V.A., Inc, the largest food service distributor in the Netherlands and a subsidiary of Royal Ahold N.V., had led the 2nd largest food distributor Rykoff-Sexton Inc. into the combination of the industry's #2, #4, and #5 largest corporations in less than 24 months. In early 1997, Mark Van Stekelenburg said, \\"Rykoff-Sexton Inc./U.S. Foodservice will be the number 1, number 2, or number 3 player in every market in which it serves the broadline foodservice distribution business.\\" In late 1997, JP Foodservice ($1.7 billion in revenues) jumped into second place among foodservice distributors with the consummation of a merger with rival Rykoff- Sexton Inc (with just under $5 billion in revenues) for $1.4 billion. Unlike previous acquisitions that JP Foodservice had undertaken, the merger with Rykoff-Sexton was much bigger. Sales were expected to triple, to $6 billion, and the number of JP Foodservice customers ballooned to 130,000. As a result, Standard & Poor's added JPF to the S&P; MidCap 400 Index. The merger also changed JP Foodservice from a major distributor in the East and Midwest into one operating coast to coast. New territories included the Southeast, the Sun Belt, and the West Coast. The reemergence of U.S. Foodservice Mark Van Stekelenburg in early 1998, now a director on the JP Foodservice Board, vice chairman of the JP Foodservice Board, and president of JP Foodservice, gave the reins of the corporation to Jim Miller, and returned to Royal Ahold N.V., (NYSE: AHO [ADR]), the leading international food provider with major operations in the US, Europe and Latin America. Shortly after the departure of Mark Van Stekelenburg, JP Foodservice changed its name to U.S. Foodservice. Thus the reemergence of the U.S. Foodservice corporation, previously privately held in 1995, as of Monday, March 2, 1998, the trading symbol was changed from \\"JPF\\" to \\"UFSD\\" and was now being traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. Acquisitions continued even as the new U.S. Foodservice (NYSE: UFS) worked to assimilate the Rykoff-Sexton operations, adding Sorrento Food Service, Inc., of Buffalo, Westlund, a Minnesota custom cut meat specialist and a number of other smaller foodservice companies. By mid-1998, Chairman and CEO Jim Miller was proud of the accomplishments, telling the Baltimore Sun, \\"We not only successfully completed the largest merger ever in our industry, tripling the size of our company, we did so achieving record earnings and meeting or exceeding virtually every goal set out in our merger plan.\\" In the 3rd quarter of the calendar year 1998, U.S. Foodservice announced it was selling the assets of its Rykoff-Sexton manufacturing division as part of its plan to shed its non-core operations. The successful integration of the larger Rykoff-Sexton company made U.S. Foodservice a favorite among analysts, and the company itself indicated it was still on the lookout for purchases in the highly fragmented foodservice industry. One year later, 1999, fiscal 2000, U.S. Foodservice is generating sales that exceed $7 billion and has caught the attention of Royal Ahold N.V. (NYSE: AHO [ADR]). Within the first quarter of calendar year 2000, Royal Ahold has filed a tender offer, filed by Ahold Acquisition, Inc. and Koninklijke Ahold N.V. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to purchase all outstanding shares of U.S. Foodservice. =The 2000s= March 20, 2000, U.S. Foodservice agreed to be acquired by Royal Ahold for $26 per share or $3.6 billion. To strengthen its presence in the southeastern United States, U.S. Foodservice acquired former sister company PYA/Monarch for $1.57 billion on December 5, 2000. The acquisition meant U.S. Foodservice's sales would now reach $12 billion annually. In November 2001, the U.S. Foodservice division of Ahold, acquired Alliant Exchange Inc., parent company of Alliant Foodservice. This greatly expanded the geographical range of its activities. In fact, U.S. Foodservice said Alliant would give it access to 21 new U.S. markets. This $2.2 billion purchase gives U.S. Foodservice distribution centers and food processing facilities in areas that are serving 100,000 customers‚Äîincluding independent and multiunit restaurant operations, hotels, contract foodservice operations and healthcare facilities. In 2000, Alliant Foodservice reported revenues of $6.6 billion. (Kraft Foodservice became Alliant Foodservice in 1996 after Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. purchased the Kraft Foodservice division from the Philip Morris Corporation). After the Alliant acquisition, U.S. Foodservice was now generating combined total revenues of approaching $14 billion. U.S. Foodservice growth was 600% over the last 6 years, from about $2 billion in revenues in 1995, to $14 billion in late 2001. The making of U.S. Foodservice reflects the trends of its industry: from retail to institutional customers; from specific products to a broadline of offerings; from single distribution centers to multi-unit branches; increased professionalism and customer service; and, most pronounced, the continuing and aggressive expansion through acquisition. U.S. Foodservice taken private by investment funds During 2006 there was much speculation as to which equity firm would acquire U.S. Foodservice from Royal Ahold. Ahold had refused to consider a spinoff of the subsidiary to the capital markets, and appeared to be headed toward an auction that JP Morgan would manage. This was consistent with many larger going concerns in the United States that appeared to be headed away from being publicly traded in what many believed was an attempt to avoid the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. After the internal accounting controls and procedures struggles that U.S. Foodservice had gone through over the past 3 years‚Äîthe very same that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address‚Äîone had to wonder if U.S. Foodservice being privately held was the proper path toward a transparent valuation of the company. On May 2, 2007, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. (CD&R;) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR) announced a definitive agreement to acquire U.S. Foodservice from Royal Ahold. Funds affiliated with CD&R; and KKR are equal partners in the transaction, valued at $7.1 billion. The Washington Post quoted Robert S. Goldin, an executive vice president at Technomic, a food consulting firm in Chicago, as saying, \\"When Ahold acquired U.S. Foodservice, the industry consensus was that it overpaid.\\" Industry analysts had previously estimated U.S. Foodservice could be worth $5.1 billion to $5.7 billion, the Post reported, adding that industry experts now agreed that Ahold got top dollar. \\"For Ahold this is a reasonably good end to what's been a pretty unsuccessful foray into U.S. food distribution,\\" Goldin continued. \\"It's been a sore spot for them. They overpaid for the business and never rationalized it. I would imagine they are pretty happy to put this one behind them.\\" The Post added that \\"Ahold was forced to restate more than $800 million in earnings after it came to light that U.S. Foodservice executives had inflated promotional rebates from suppliers to meet earnings targets. The scandal caused the parent company's shares to plunge.\\" \\"Ahold settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission two years ago and agreed to pay $1.1 billion to resolve shareholder lawsuits.\\" =The 2010s= On August 13, 2010, U.S. Foodservice announced that John A.

Khaled worked in Canada as a computer engineer, starting in 1995. According to the U.S. diplomatic cables, he was captured in April 2006, in Kandahar, spent over 18 months in US custody in Bagram.

Khaled was apprehended in Kandahar in the spring of 2006, according to a source who spoke to CBC News. According to the diplomatic cables, he was visited by Canadian consular officials eight months after his apprehension. The cables published by WikiLeaks revealed that Canadian officials were negotiating with US officials for Khaled's return to Canada. On September 27, 2011, CBC News reported that human rights experts question whether American officials had failed to inform Canadian diplomats in a timely manner, and this explained why it took eight months to make a consular visit to Ismail.

With a demissionary cabinet parliament decides which issues are controversial, which bars the cabinet from drafting legislation concerning them. A rump cabinet can take care of such issues but it does not have a majority in parliament and thus needs approval by opposition parties, which make it likely that the rump parliament will take great care dealing with controversial issues.

Listed at and , he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Biography Foley attended Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He played on each sport's freshman team, then was on the varsity of each squad for three years, earning a total of nine varsity letters; during his senior year, he was the captain of the football and baseball teams. An outfielder on the baseball team, he was signed by the New York Giants in June 1928, the same month that he graduated. Foley played in two games for the Giants during the 1928 season, his only major league appearances. His first appearance was on July 4, in the first game of a home doubleheader against the Brooklyn Robins. In the bottom of the seventh inning, with Brooklyn leading, 7‚Äì1, Foley pinch hit for pitcher Tiny Chaplin. With a runner on first base and no outs, Foley struck out facing Brooklyn pitcher Dazzy Vance. Foley did not play defensively, as he was replaced by pitcher Dutch Henry. On July 18, the Giants released Foley in order to add rookie pitcher Carl Hubbell to their roster. When Foley re-joined the Giants is unclear, as he made a second appearance on September 10, in the second game of a road doubleheader versus the Boston Braves. In the top of the seventh inning, with the Giants leading, 7‚Äì0, Foley again pinch hit, this time for catcher Shanty Hogan. With runners on second and third with one out, Foley drew a walk against Braves' pitcher Foster Edwards, loading the bases. Foley advanced to second base on a ground out, then scored on a single. He again did not play defensively, as he was replaced by catcher Bob O'Farrell. In January 1929, the Giants sent Foley to the minor league Bridgeport Bears of the Eastern League. However, Foley does not appear in the statistical summary of Bridgeport's 1929 season. By October 1940, Foley was married and working for the board of education in his hometown of Naugatuck, Connecticut. He was inducted to the athletics hall of fame at Catholic University in 1977. Foley died in March 1980 in Vero Beach, Florida, and was interred in Naugatuck. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.

Howard attending the annual Restoration Studies Symposium in April 2011. Richard P. Howard is an American historian emeritus of Community of Christ, having served as world church historian of that organization (previously named the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) from 1966‚Äì1994. He was the first professionally trained scholar to occupy that position.David J. Howlett, Barbara B. Walden, and John C. Hamer, Community of Christ: An Illustrated History, (Independence, Missouri: Herald Publishing House, 2010), 59. Howard has frequently been compared to Leonard Arrington, his counterpart in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).D. Michael Quinn, \\"On Being a Mormon Historian (and Its Aftermath),\\" in Faithful History: Essays on Writing Mormon History, George D. Smith (ed.), (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1992), 72. Both church historians are recognized as pioneering scholars of the New Mormon History. Howard's contributions include foundational work on Latter Day Saint scriptureMarvin Hill, \\"The 'New Mormon History' Reassessed in Light of Recent Books on Joseph Smith and Mormon Origins,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Fall 2002):122. and the professionalization of the history of the Reorganization and the Community of Christ. His research into the origins of Mormon polygamy helped change his church's official stance on the subject.Howlett, Walden, and Hamer (2010), 58. Education Howard earned an associate degree from Graceland College, a B.A. in education from the University of Kansas, and an M.A. in history from the University of California-Berkeley. He pursued further graduate studies at the University of Kansas, American University in Washington, D.C., and Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Missouri.Richard P. Howard, The Church Through the Years, Vol. 1: RLDS Beginnings to 1860 (Independence, Missouri: Herald Publishing House, 1992) About the Author. RLDS Church historian, 1966‚Äì1994 When Charles A. Davies retired as church historian of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1963, Howard succeeded him in that position, becoming the first professionally trained RLDS church historian.William D. Russell, \\"A Brief History of the John Whitmer Historical Association,\\" in The John Whitmer Historical Association: 2002 Nauvoo Conference Special Edition, by Joni Wilson (ed.) (Independence, Missouri: The John Whitmer Historical Association, 2002) 147. This change took place against the backdrop of a broader trend of professionalization in the history of the Latter Day Saint movement commonly known as the \\"New Mormon History\\". In the RLDS context, major participants in the New Mormon History included Howard, Robert Flanders, Alma Blair, Barbara Higdon, Paul M. Edwards, William D. Russell, and W. Grant McMurray. Howard's first major contribution was a study of the scriptures produced by Joseph Smith Jr., entitled Restoration Scriptures: A Study of Their Textual Development (1969).Richard P. Howard, Restoration Scriptures: A Study of Their Textual Development (Independence, Missouri: Herald Publishing House, 1969). In this work, Howard noted evolutionary changes in the Joseph Smith Translation or \\"Inspired Version\\" of the Bible and similar changes in the revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. More provocative was his comparison of the various texts of the Book of Mormon from the 1829 manuscript through the 1840 printed version. In noting the numerous changes in the text, Howard concluded that the composition process of the Book of Mormon could not have been a word for word \\"translation\\" that some of Smith's contemporaries reported. Howard's study received the \\"Best Book Award\\" from the Mormon History Association in 1969/1970. While serving as church historian, Howard contributed articles to the independent, progressive RLDS periodical, Courage: A Journal of History, Thought, and Action. Published quarterly between 1970 and 1973, Courage anticipated many of the progressive changes that would occur within the RLDS Church as it transformed into the Community of Christ.William D. Russell, \\"Courage: A Liberal Journal Foreshadows RLDS Doctrinal Shifts,\\" John Whitmer Historical Association Journal, vol. 28 (2008): 155‚Äì56. Howard's contributions included a study of the Book of Abraham in which he concluded with candor that \\"separate analyses of modern Egyptologists have established conclusive evidences that Joseph Smith's Book of Abraham (text and interpretations of the papyri drawings) is not even remotely related to the cultural reality behind the inscriptions and artwork on the Egyptian papyri brought to Kirtland.\\"Richard P. Howard, \\"The 'Book of Abraham' in the Light of History and Egyptology\\" Courage: A Journal of History, Thought, and Action Pilot Issue (April 1970): 45-45. Howard further suggested that \\"it may be helpful to suggest that the Book of Abraham represents simply the product of Joseph Smith Jr.'s imagination\\" because it is \\"neither a scholarly translation...nor any kind of 'inspired' translation.\\" Howard was one of the first three RLDS historians to join the Mormon History Association (MHA), and he was among the original fifteen founders of the John Whitmer Historical Association (JWHA) on September 18, 1972. He served as president of JWHA in 1985 and as president of MHA in 1990‚Äì91. Also among the founders of JWHA was Howard's assistant in the Church Historian's Office, W. Grant McMurray. McMurray later became a member of the church's First Presidency, rising ultimately to become prophet- president of the church. By the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional RLDS view that Brigham Young rather than Joseph Smith Jr. was the origin of Mormon polygamy had been called into question by scholars of the New Mormon History. In 1965, Robert B. Flanders, a professor of history at Graceland College published Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi. Flanders concluded that the traditional RLDS view was incorrect, asserting instead that the practice had indeed originated with Joseph Smith.Robert B. Flanders, Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1965), 272. In 1977, the First Presidency of the RLDS Church directed Howard to investigate the issue. Several years of careful study led Howard to generally agree with Flanders' conclusions. His seminal article on the topic, \\"The Changing RLDS Response to Mormon Polygamy: A Preliminary Analysis\\" (1983), opened the door to reassess the church's official policy.The article was published in The John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Vol. 3 (1983): 14‚Äì29, and Restoration Studies Vol. 3 (1986): 145‚Äì162. However, as Howard recalled decades later, this study was \\"heavily edited\\" and \\"watered down\\" at the direction of church leaders and Howard considered its final form to be \\"a painful compromise.\\"Newell G. Bringhurst, \\"RLDS Church Reaction to the LDS Doctrine and Covenants‚Äô Section 132: Conflicting Responses and Changing Perceptions,\\" in Newell G. Bringhurst and Craig L. Foster (eds.), The Persistence of Polygamy: Joseph Smith and the Origins of Mormon Polygamy, (Independence, Missouri: John Whitmer Books, 2010), 276‚Äì77. Among Howard's final accomplishments as church historian was the production of The Church through the Years, published in two volumes in 1992 and 1993. Volume 1 was subtitled \\"RLDS Beginnings to 1860\\" and Volume 2 was subtitled \\"The Reorganization Comes of Age, 1860‚Äì1992.\\" As Howard explains in his introduction, the work resulted from the desire of RLDS prophet-president W. Wallace Smith to have \\"a more legitimate history of the church\\" with the goal of producing \\"a more honest, less defensive history.\\"Richard P. Howard, The Church Through the Years: Volume 1: RLDS Beginnings, to 1860 (Independence, Missouri: Herald Publishing House, 1992), 9. In a review published in the John Whitmer Historical Association Journal, Mormon historian Glen Leonard (a member of the LDS Church) agreed that Howard had \\"written a less defensive (though still denominational) and more legitimate (though still faith-centered) history of the church through its formative years.\\"John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Vol. 12 (1992): 104. Retirement and Emeritus Historian, 1994‚Äìpresent Howard retired as church historian in 1994, becoming church historian emeritus. He was succeeded by Mark A. Scherer. Since his retirement, Howard has continued to publish new articles and to actively promote scholarship. More recent articles by Howard include, \\"The Quest for Traces of a Peace Gene in Restoration History\\"Richard P. Howard, \\"The Quest for Traces of a Peace Gene in Restoration History,\\" John Whitmer Historical Association Journal, Vol. 23 (2003): 45. and \\"The RLDS Church's Anti-Polygamy Stance Adapted/Canonized 1967‚Äì1972: The Specter of an Impending Schism\\"Presented at the 39th Annual Meeting of JWHA in Nauvoo, Illinois, on September 23, 2011. Since Ronald E. Romig retired as church archivist in 2009, Howard has served as a part-time volunteer in the Community of Christ Archives at the temple in Independence, Missouri. The John Whitmer Historical Association presented Howard with its \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" in 2003. On September 24, 2011, at the association's annual presidential banquet, outgoing president John C. Hamer announced that the association would sponsor an annual lecture series named the \\"Richard P. Howard Lecture\\" beginning in 2012.

It was finished in 1197 during the reign of the Grand Prince Vsevolod the Big Nest of Vladimir-Suzdal to the honour of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. Being an important component of the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal, the cathedral belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO. Currently, the cathedral is a part of the Vladimir-Suzdal open-air museum.  History  The Cathedral of St. Dmitrii in Vladimir, Russia was built by Vsevolod III in 1193-7. It was one of several large churches he had built which also include the much larger Cathedral of Dormition, 1158-60, also in Vladimir, Russia. The cathedral was dedicated to St. Dmitrii of Salonika (St. Demetrios of Thesseloinka in Greek). The Cathedral of St. Dmitrii was originally connected directly with Vsevolod‚Äôs palace and was for his personal use. The palace no longer exists and the church has been renovated many times since it was first built but it has kept is predominant features and iconographic program. The most extensive renovation was in 1832 when the some attached structures which used to connect it to the palace were removed. At that time, some of the exterior blocks were moved and some replaced with newly carved blocks.Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53  Exterior  The cathedral is masonry and made from local white limestone blocks. It is cubic in form similar to many earlier churches in Bogolyubovo especially the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl (1165).Hamilton, George Heard. The art and architecture of Russia. Penguin Books, 1983, page 62. It has four columns on the interior which supports drum and cupola. The exterior walls are separated into three bays each with the one in the middle larger than the others. Each bay contains a zakomara at the top. They are also separated at mid-level by a horizontal arcade frieze. One side of the cathedral contains an apse which is also separated into three parts. The windows and doors are deeply recessed with extensive carved ornamentation.  Carvings  King David surrounded by angels and chimeras. Cathedral of Saint Demetrius. Vladimir.

The source of the artisans and provenance for these carvings seems to be an amalgam of many influences. The most likely are earlier Bogoluiubovo churches, Balkan churches and Armenian churches.Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 52 Vladimir, at end of the 12th century, was a cosmopolitan and artistic center. Architects and artisans from both the east and west who resided there were used in the construction of the church. In addition, Vsevolod‚Äôs mother was a Byzantine princess and Vsevolod lived in Constantinople for several years during his childhood. Another source of inspiration may also have been portable carvings such as Byzantine ivories.Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 55-6 The carvings consist of animals and plants as well as figures in rows and scenes in the zakomary. Some carvings are also ornamental patterns. The patterns, plants and animals (both real and imaginary) might be based pagan beliefs and traditions,Kornilovich, K. (1967). Arts of Russia : From the origins to the end of the 16th century. Cleveland: World Pub, page 54 traditional Russia folkloreBrumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53 or Christian theological themes.Hamilton, George Heard. The art and architecture of Russia. Penguin Books, 1983, page 77. These types of carvings make of the majority of the decoration on the cathedral. In each zakomara, there is a figural scene. The most prominent, on the west fa√ßade in the central bay, is a scene featuring King David surrounded by angels and chimeras. King David is also featured on the south fa√ßade central bay surrounded by warrior saints. Other prominent figures, in addition to Christ and Mary, include Solomon, Alexander the Great, Hercules, warrior saints and churchmen. The final piece of this theme being the zakomara of the north fa√ßade left showing the donor, Vsevolod with his sons. In a time when power and territory were taken and held by military might, the building of churches and palaces which support the prince‚Äôs authority are important. This cathedral, not unlike the Cathedral of Dormition by its size and grandeur, by its iconographic program reinforces the prince‚Äôs authority by linking it to ancient kings and philosophers, biblical figures and military leaders.Brumfield, W. (1993). A history of Russian architecture. Cambridge ; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, Page 53  Interior  While a few carvings are still intact inside the cathedral, the most important original feature of the interior are a few frescoes above and around the west entrance that have survived since the late 12th century. The quality of the work varies. The best work in the faces of saints and angels in the Last Judgement scene are likely the work of Byzantine masters with their Russian pupils completing less important parts such as drapery and background. The lines and shading of the better parts is comparable to the best work in Greece and Byzantium. The icon of the Virgin of Vladimir was also known to be in the nearby Cathedral of Dormition at the time the frescoes were painted so was likely a source of inspiration and training.Hare, Richard.

The branding of the stranded service is distinctive both in the past and at present. Pre Children's BBC Prior to the launch of Children's BBC on 9 September 1985, BBC1 used some specialist branding for its children's strand. The origins of CBBC can be found in the \\"Children's Hour\\" of the original BBC Television Service, but prior to 1984, children's programmes received no special idents and continuity was done out of vision by the duty continuity announcer. However, between programmes, some special branding was put in use to reflect better the audience they were serving. In the 1970s, the programme caption was changed to a blue and yellow variation featuring the faces of a boy and girl, with references to other programmes: Zebedee from The Magic Roundabout, Scooby-Doo, and title cards and logos from Play School and Blue Peter. The slide was in fact coloured by the NODD system used to produce the globe at the time. The slide was later changed in 1981 to a group of children staring at the caption in excitement, following the change of globe. Promotions now featured slides of balloons, with the programme name in the centre, and occasionally accompanied by the official static captions. Just prior to the launch of Children's BBC, a BBC Micro B 3D Collage was introduced to generate computer generated stings for the children's strand. Such animations were used to introduce programme, such as a spider spinning down onto a detonator triggering the words Hello from BBC1, and to link into promotions for further programmes, such as a group of sky divers falling from a plane to spell out a 'Later' caption. However, despite the graphics, programmes were still directly introduced by the BBC1 globe symbol, albeit occasionally accompanied by a choice of two different 14-note synthesized tunes. Children's BBC =Original Logo= The first ident for Children's BBC once again made use of the BBC Micro B computer. The design featured the word 'Children's' on top of a large sprawled 'BBC' made up of the three colours red, green and blue. In ident, each letter of the BBC animated in to the four note electronic soundtrack, with the Children's scrolling across afterwards. It originally had a blue background, but this was changed to black after a few months. The letters were also all turned yellow in autumn 1986, and were set against a white background whenever programmes were broadcast on BBC2. From the launch of the branding, live in-vision continuity was generally broadcast by a dedicated team of presenters from a small self-op Presentation studio within the BBC1 network control area at Television Centre. The presenter would talk, interact with other characters, and view children‚Äôs pictures and letters, many of which would end up on the dressed back wall of the booth. They would also operate sound and vision mixers to partially direct their own links, although overall responsibility for transmission belonged to duty transmission staff in the adjacent network control room (NC1). For times when Children's BBC aired on BBC2, the presenter would appear in-vision from the network's self-op continuity studio, although this was not usually dressed with set branding and remained plain. A running joke would develop where the duty presenter (i.e. Phillip Schofield) would present their links in a dinner jacket because BBC2 was considered more highbrow. Promotions were of no particular style, with the. promotion usually voiced by the duty presenter and featuring only the programme name and title at the bottom of the screen. In 1987, the BBC Micro ident was replaced by one created using stop motion animation. In this ident, each of the letters of the word 'Children's' was allocated an image beginning with that letter. These images - a car, a horse, an ice cream, a lighthouse, a duck, a rocket, an elephant, a number nine and a ship - would all be drawn on screen by yellow wispy lines, which after drawing all the animals would animate out to draw the 'BBC' caption. This ident was played out from tape, as opposed to the live BBC Micro ident. These pictures also appeared on other Children's BBC items, such as stationery: letters sent from the Children's BBC office to children would have these images superimposed upon the background of the document. During this time, the presenters began to devise new ways of filling the time slots, with competitions and features taking precedence. Alongside these new additions, changes were being made to BBC Presentation, and the Broom Cupboard itself. In 1989, the continuity booth was equipped with NICAM digital stereo, and as a result, Children's BBC presentation was moved temporarily to a smaller studio, nicknamed the 'Boiler Room'. This was based in a reserve network control area (NC3) generally used between the two networks during maintenance or engineering work, from where the Broom Cupboard nickname had originated. On 4 September 1989, the new ident was generated live on air by an Acorn Archimedes computer. The new ident featured a glossy, gold version of the familiar stylised BBC text, with Pale green text for the 'Children's' caption and a dark green background superimposed with small stylised CBBC's in the same font as the main 'BBC' section of the logo. The ident formed up through the use of zig-zag lines and concentric circles, which continued to move around and between the letters. =Corporate Logo= On 16 February 1991, BBC1 and 2 both relaunched with corporate branding packages based on a Virtual Globe and the antics of a numeral 2. Both packages had a similar promotional design and both featured a large numeral above a BBC logo at the bottom of the screen. As part of this relaunch, Children's BBC also received its own symbol based on this design. It was implemented at the beginning of the academic year on 9 September 1991. The new symbol took the emphasis away from the 'BBC' and placed it firmly with the 'Children's' part of the name. This new logo featured a large neon style letter replacing every other letter in the 'Children's' name, with the exception of 'D' which had a neon strip curve around the letter. This appeared against a dark background of an assortment of colours and accompanied by an upbeat soundtrack accompanied in some versions by a voice saying phrases such as \\"Tell that aardvark it's a wrap\\" and \\"Essential viewing coming up\\". The original electronic beat music was seen as too slow and dull originally, and so was replaced soon after. Accompanied with the new look, the Broom Cupboard received a makeover with new neon signage matching the new logo as well as the presenters name in a similar style to the logo. In addition to this, Children's BBC also received a corporate styling for promotions, slides and menus. Promotions were kept the same as the channel they were broadcast on, however the menu and slide design was unique. The slide design, in line with BBC1 and 2, featured a sidebar down the left hand side of the screen, with the channel logo located in the top left hand corner of the screen, above a BBC corporate logo. The Children's BBC slides however, also had the Children's BBC logo inserted sideways into the sidebar, and images from the ident featured as the background to programme menus. These slides and menus were used prior to a start-up into Children's BBC, and for promotional use outside of Children's BBC itself, for example after the morning strand was completed. BBC Scotland had their version of the 1991 - 1994 ident which was the same as the network version but with the Scotland branding incorporated into the ident. These were used in the school holidays from the launch of Children's BBC Scotland in July 1991 - July 1994. This logo remained with Children's BBC until 1997, however the ident itself changed within half that time. In 1994, Children's BBC moved out of the soon-to-be- decommissioned network control area, bringing an end to the Broom Cupboard era, and into the larger Pres A studio which had been used for birthday slots, weekend and holiday strands. To mark the move, CBBC, as it was becoming increasingly known informally by the presenters, commissioned a new ident. Launched on 5 September 1994, the logo remained, however was rendered in 3D and set at a slight angle and formed in chunks. This was accompanied by a 3D BBC logo located in the bottom right corner of the screen, and set against a moving rainbow coloured background with bits of black on it. This was later replaced in 1996 by a version on a moving yellow background, with a 2D grey BBC logo. Throughout this era, a variety of logos were produced by BBC Manchester's Graphic design department for use, that featured computer- generated animations or cartoons and would include the Children's BBC logo in it somewhere, either as a whole or in part, and often accompanied by the BBC logo. These later logos and idents include: *Alien - A farmers field is shown, with an alien spaceship hovering above and a scarecrow standing in the fields. The scarecrow turns around to reveal an alien in its place, and the shot pans out to the field with 'Children's' inscribed in it, and the BBC logo on the spaceship. *Bee - A bumble bee encounters a venus fly trap, which it then swallows, before turning into the black and yellow BBC logo and the 'Children's' letters falling from above. *Boy - Letters from the 'Children's' jump out from his face in various orders, and when the boy opens his mouth, the 'Children's' can be seen on his uvula, dangling from the roof of his mouth, with the BBC logo on his tongue. *Christmas Rooftop - on a winter's night (with the flashing grey 'Children's' logo in the dark). Father Christmas twists a few times in a chimney (with the 'Children's' logo on the sack next to the chimney.) and brings up high into the sky, the reindeer stands in the chimney a few seconds and then Father Christmas crashes back into the chimney and the BBC logo appears on the grey paving slabs on the roof after the snow slides off the roof and the reindeer has a couple of giggles on the rooftop. *Christmas Tumble- Father Christmas strolls along in the snow and then brings out of sight when letters of the 'Children's' logo (and a couple of presents) fly in all directions, then Father Christmas gasps when he sees the 'Children's' logo electrocuting on the reindeer's antlers while the reindeer hold the BBC logo between his teeth. *Cow - Four cows are seen standing on small balls of grass, the last of which blows a bubble, containing the 'Children's' logo, with the BBC logo contained in three flowers. *Egyptian - In Egypt, a mummy walks past where the lizard sits on the coffin, a lid opens and bandage comes undone one by one the letters of the 'Children's' inside and a lizard dances an Egyptian dance. *Frankenstein - a sad monster looks out of the window, Thunder rumbles and lightning crackles as the machine contains the 'Children's' logo, The monster cheers himself up by pulling every lever of the machine whilst electrocuting himself. *Jazz - The Children's BBC logo is seen split vertically, and stretched directions, against a plain blue background and a jazzy version of the soundtrack. *Mechanical Dogs - Metal, mechanical dogs bark at letters of the 'Children's' raised on metal stilts above them, which come together to form the logo. The BBC logo is on one of the dogs. *Noddy - On the same moving rainbow coloured background with bits of black from the main Children's BBC ident from 1994-1996, Noddy (from the Noddy's Toyland Adventures TV series) walks into view with the BBC logo on a piece of card in his hands under the \\"Children's\\" logo. He stops and smiles at the camera for a quick second, then finally walks a quick pace to stop in the middle of the screen to wave at the camera. before finally taking a bow. *Oakie Doke - A ident featuring the titular character of the children's TV series Oakie Doke. *Otis the Aardvark Paint - A cartoon version of Children's BBC puppet Otis the Aardvark paints a picture and the logo is in the middle of the painting. *Otis the Aardvark Toffee - A cartoon version of Children's BBC puppet Otis the Aardvark eats toffees out of a tin and gets his nose caught in the tin. The CBBC logo is on the bottom of the tin. *Pig - A live piglet roams around an area with numerous 'Children's' imposed on the floor, and just as many BBC logos imposed on the back wall. Various shots of the pig end with the Children's BBC logo on the pig's rear. *Pingu - A 2D version of Pingu finishes building a snow park with a snowman in the middle (and the striped Children's letters on the top of the banderole with some snow at the top). The snowman gasps, then sneezes. Pingu comes out of the D and looks up at the sky giggling. A 3-D grey-and-black 1988-1997 BBC logo falls from above. *Princess & Frog - A princess kisses a frog, turning her into a variety of objects including a cow and a pair of pants, before becoming a frog. Another kiss turns both into the Children's BBC logo before the changes continue. *Sculptor - A man in a toga sculpts a block of stone with the BBC logo carved into it. However he hits too hard, resulting in the stone crumbling away to reveal the 'Children's'. Then, the man then himself crumbles into a delighted child. *Singing Duck and Fish - Two friends, duck and fish sing a short jingle about Children's BBC, while the other holds up the words. The Children's BBC logo appears on the back wall. *Space - A spaceship flies round planets, before crashing into a moon, leaving the Children's BBC logo to circle to wreckage. *Surfboard - A man surfs on a board, before falling off, sending a large wave into shore, which washes up the Children's BBC logo. *Teen's Bedroom - A teenager struggles out of a messy bedroom into the hall. While he is gone, the numerous letters of the logo, the 1988-1997 BBC logo, and the logo of the channel it is on all appear in different locations around the room. The same thing is repeated when he staggers back in, but with the BBC1 1991-1997 \\"1\\" and the BBC2 1991-2001,2014-2018 \\"2\\". *Underwater - A diver appears inside a fishbowl, only to reveal the bowl is underwater, inhabited by an Elvis fish. *William's Wish Wellingtons - A ident featuring William from the children's TV series William's Wish Wellingtons. In addition to these, some were used for certain programmes, such as Saturday Aardvark, which used bubbles with letters of the 'Children's' on them, and the Breakfast show. Originally this utilised a personalised TV screen with a CBBC ident displaying in the viewer but was later replaced by a cereal box that poured out Children's BBC logos, BBC logos and logos from some of the programmes. BBC Scotland also had their versions of the Children's BBC idents which were the same as the network versions but with the Scotland branding incorporated into the ident. These were used on weekday mornings in the school holidays from October 1994 - July 1997. The 1991 - 1994 ident, along with its accompanying Broom Cupboard theming, was re-used on September 9, 2015 as part of the anniversary special Hacker's Birthday Bash: 30 Years of Children's BBC. CBBC =Yellow animations= On 4 October 1997, the new BBC logo was launched by the corporation, and all of the BBC's channels and services received a makeover. CBBC was no different, with a new logo and idents package to match a newly refurbished set for TC9. The new logo was seen everywhere on every channel in near identical design, so that the BBC's output was centralised, and as a result CBBC's logo featured a 'C' added in front of the BBC blocks logo, with the name of the service added after, be it CBBC One, CBBC Two, CBBC Scotland, CBBC on Nickelodeon and CBBC Choice. Whereas before, CBBC tried to portray the end of one service, and the beginning of another, this look made it feel like CBBC was taking over that service. The new idents all featured a yellow and black colour scheme and featured a two-dimensional animation based around a surreal concept, an interesting design, or an adventure scene. Promotions for the service featured the same promotional style as the other services, with the CBBC logo at the bottom and the programme and channel details centred at the bottom for widescreen, which came later in mid-2000-2002. Also getting a makeover was the set in TC9. Again following the yellow and black theme, notable parts include large CBBC logos extending upright the columns, a large video wall made up of 12 televisions, and a desktop computer used to promote the CBBC website. *Blobs - Black blobs, similar to those found in a lava lamp object, are seen rising up the screen. *Cat and Bird - A bird pecks around in seeds and crumbs before finding a worm stuck down a hole. Pulling the worm free, the bird finds out it is a cat's tail, who promptly chases after the bird. *Cat and Mouse - The cat chases a mouse into its hole and lies in wait. The mouse emerges disguised under a leaf. The cat, impatient, sticks his head in the hole, allowing the mouse to get away. *Dragon - A dragon scrambles up on to a rock, prepares to take flight, only to fall down to the bottom. *Fish - A shoal of five fish swim across the screen, turn so they are only seen as thin lines emitting bubbles, before turning back across the screen. A longer version of this ident was produced. *Frog - A frog, sat on a lily pad, spots a fly above him, sticks his tongue out to catch the fly, only to be pulled off into the air. *Magician - A magician performs the act of pulling his own shirt off, as he attempts to pull something from his top hat (which unfortunately doesn't appear to be a rabbit at all), much to his embarrassment. *Man and Dog - A man walks his fluffy dog on a lead. The dog, however, gets caught on a rock and unravels into a single line, much to the owner's bemusement. *Mole - A mole digging a tunnel comes to the surface to clear his glasses, before continuing on. *Mouse - A mouse (out of breath) arrives on screen and comes up with the idea to take his ears off for wheels, his tail for handlebars and his nose for a seat, becoming a bicycle, then cycles quickly off the screen, the rest of his body looking like a bike racer. A still from this ident was used when they had technical difficulties at the time. *Octopus - An octopus swims into view, spots the viewer, and hides in his own ink, allowing him to get away. *Skunk - A skunk grabs a can of deodorant and sprays it on him. He is soon disgusted by the smell and throws the can into a bin where many of cans are. *Snail - A snail moves on, checks nobody is looking, and quickly scratches his back by lifting his shell off. *Space Girl - A girl flying a spaceship in the Japanese Manga style. *Spiral - Various swirls, spirals and circles all moving towards the screen. *Tiger - A tiger stalks and hides in a jungle environment, and surprises the camera. *North Pole - A CGI animation flies a snow trees to form a number 2. *CBBC Movie Premiere - Otis The Aardvark, sitting of chair, holding a popcorn and TV screen and eat. In addition to these idents, there was also idents for the programmes Saturday Aardvark and the CBBC Breakfast Show. BBC Scotland also had their versions of the CBBC idents which were the same as the network versions but with the Scotland branding incorporated into the ident. They were only used in the summer holidays from July 1998 until July 2000. Special idents were commissioned for Christmas, from 1997-1999 they consisted of a periscope type animation, with festive images appearing, and from 2000-2001 they were various idents with a small penguin and a snowman in various scenarios, and in summer, when the 'CBBC HOT' name was used. An animation was also introduced for the end copyright, originally a coin spinning and falling over before turning into a thick line , this later became numerous signs moving towards the viewer in mid-1999-2002. On Monday 3 September 2001, CBBC switched to widescreen and as a result, the branding was altered. Some idents were withdrawn entirely, while the rest were sped up or mixed in with others to form montages that were used instead. The music was also changed, with two versions now used: for CBBC's older viewers and for CBBC's younger viewers, in what would soon be called CBeebies. Additionally, the idents for preschool programming had clips from Tweenies mixed in. Special idents were made for CBBC on Choice before they started using the regular ones from 1998-2000. They were based on the first set of BBC Choice idents from 1998 consisting of three items with similar names, like boxer shorts, boxing gloves and a boxer dog. =The CBBC Bugs= On 11 February 2002, CBBC changed dramatically in both look and remit. The day marked the launch of the CBBC Channel, resulting in a new platform for the well-known brand. Also launched at the same time was the CBeebies channel and strand, resulting in CBBC's remit changing from 6‚Äì12 years of age, to 8‚Äì12 years. To mark both, a new identity was created for both to mark the occasion. Designed by Lambie-Nairn, the bug idents featured green moving bugs that contained the BBC logo as well as purple, textured 'C'. The bugs could split into others, and would often be depicted either fighting amongst themselves, or as being split or separated multiple times. In-vision was still used, with TC9 being used for links on BBC One and Two, and the CBBC channel using TC2, however the set was changed to vivid backgrounds with blob shapes on, often with the idents playing in the background. Promotions also changed so branding only occurred at the end, at which a wavy blue banner at the bottom would flow it with programme details on, usually with a blob looking in from the side of the screen. The new channel also had a DOG featuring the BBC logo, with a Blob containing the 'C' only in front. The DOG was not used on terrestrial links, although a clock was occasionally added for morning links, either on its own or located inside a static blob. The bugs themselves were closely related to those designed for CBeebies, and for the Canadian television station, owned by BBC Worldwide, BBC Kids. The traditional bugs were look lasted until 30 September 2005, when the blob concept was redesigned. A single blob was now used: it featured a larger and plainer 'C' letter and was turned into a three-dimensional object, which would zoom around a screen often accompanied by a ball from which many arrows could point and some crystal lines were flying about. The idents had also the CBBC stars in the purple background with various floating objects (such as the cash registers for Kerching!, the heart balloons for Tracy Beaker or the flying birds for Raven) inside the blob, including Dani Harmer, James Mackenzie, Nev the Bear, Basil Brush, Devon Anderson, Tendayi Jembere, Jamie Sweeney, Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood. This style was changed so that the end screen changed to a single shot of the bug with the programme name below, and the DOG was also updated. In-vision for the channel continued to be used, however, it was used less and less: CBBC moved out of TC9 in December 2006 to TC12, where the presenter would just stand in front of a bluescreen while only a fixed camera is used. =Stylised CBBC= CBBC relaunched again on Monday 3 September 2007, with a new logo revolving around the letters of CBBC, each in a different style. A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 stylised letters before coming together at the end. These scenes could involve cartoon figures (including the animated CBBC shows like Shaun the Sheep and Tracy Beaker), or stars of current CBBC programmes (such as Barney Harwood, Basil Brush, James Mackenzie, Daniel Anthony, Dani Harmer, Ed Petrie, Oucho T. Cactus, Mark Speight, Kirsten O'Brien, Richard Hammond, Sam Nixon, Mark Rhodes, Caroline Flack, Gethin Jones, Andy Akinwolere, Z√∂e Salmon and the cast of M.I. High). Numerous different styles were made involving the different scenes, and were added regularly to reflect programmes. Children could also make their own versions, the so-called Mash Up, on the CBBC website, and indeed some of these were added to the main set. At the end of this sequence, a two-dimensional cartoon style endboard was added that contained the CBBC logo animating into place, against a white background with the green zig-zag lines of the look animating around the edge of the screen. This was altered on 10 September 2010, when the CBBC logo was given a 3D glossy look, and as a result the end boards were changed to a fully formed CBBC logo moving around on the green bars on the screen. In 2013, they added new variations of the idents which mixed up a few idents, or at least changed ONE thing about it. Accompanying these idents at the end of the CBBC strand or Channel, were two cartoon characters. These, in the form of a dancing fox and a hairy monster, would point out additional CBBC services. This would normally consist of pointing out the CBBC website and, if currently broadcasting, the CBBC channel. Promotions consisted of the video with the CBBC logo, programme title and times appearing at the end on the green zig-zag lines that accompanied the channel. This was altered in 2010, so the video would shrink into a box contained within the white and green lines where the CBBC logo now originated at the end of the idents. The programme title would now be overlaid the white background, rather than be incorporated into the design. The DOG for the CBBC channel was also changed to the new logo, however it retained its green colour scheme, and would often animate, with the letters popping out and in at regular intervals. The new look was created by the Children's BBC marketing team, with Red Bee Media designing the new logo and idents, and Fallon, who created the new TV trails that were used prior to launch. =2014 Ident Update= On 13 September 2014, CBBC introduced a new set idents after seven years, whilst retaining the existing logo. The new idents featured various animated scenes containing references to the programming, like the previous look from 2007 to 2014. =Just Imagine= On 14 March 2016, CBBC rebranded with a new logo that was similar to BBC Three's, dropping the logo that had been used for the last eight years. New idents were introduced, a range of live action and animated which consists of everyday situations in the modern era. *Generic - Animated bright colours form the CBBC logo. Used for a variety of programming. *Bed - A boy with a headlamp reads a book on his duvet cover. Mainly used for serious programming and closedown. *Drone - A group of students walk to school with one bag being held by the drone. The logo is then formed by animated drones flying different segments of the logo in. Typically used for after-school programming. *Lights - A group of children move around glow sticks to form the logo. Used for entertainment programming. *Powder - A teenage boy jumps on a trampoline with powder of the different coloured logo segments flying around. A piece of stencil card is then held up to form the logo. Used for entertainment programming. *Slinky - A group of children in a gym place coloured slinkies on the treadmills to make an infinite loop. The camera pans to show the formed logo. Typically used for factual and entertainment programming. *Window - A boy and a girl throw coloured plastic toy animals such as frogs and spiders on a window to form the logo. Usually used for comedy programming. *Igloo - Children create an igloo shaped like the logo. First used in December 2016 as the Christmas ident; it was later edited to be part of the set. CBeebies CBeebies was launched with the CBBC Channel on 11 February 2002, with an original age range of pre- school children only. Following changes within the BBC Children's department, this changed to ages up to 6, with CBBC targeting ages 6 to 12.The idents for the channel, designed by Lambie-Nairn, are the same as at launch and consist of yellow blobs, the opposite to the green blobs launched with the CBBC Channel with a much younger feel, as befits the target audience. The yellow blobs would bounce around gently to each other in a brightly coloured and patterned environment, with the CBeebies logo located in the centre top of the screen. The soundtrack was also gentle, with children's voices calling out the channel name, and the whole look was deliberately meant to be parallel, yet completely different from their sister channel, CBBC. In addition to these idents, some idents were created featuring the presenters bouncing the CBeebies logo around like a beach ball, and some which featured the blobs taking part in time related idents, such as sleeping on the moon in the Bedtime Hour or drinking milk at Lunchtime or riding a bike in Big Fun Time. Some idents are specific to strands of programmes, such as Discover and Do. Contains videos of CBeebies idents, continuity, promotions and other aspects of CBeebies presentation.CBeebies, like CBBC before it, make use of in-vision continuity links, however these are not presented by the CBeebies directors, but are recorded rather than broadcast live. The presenters make use of a large, colourful space with smooth lines and everyday objects, which is again appropriate to the age range. Promotions originally featured a similar style as CBBC, with a patterned and coloured bar running across the bottom of the end of the promotion, featuring the title and CBeebies logo. Video containing CBeebies Continuity. This was changed in 2007 to three pattered hills overlapping each at the bottom of the screen. From 2009, the CBeebies logo and programme name would be contained within the center hill, with the left hill taken up by a yellow blob containing a clock with the time of the programme on, and the right occasionally containing details such as whether the programme was new. The channel also uses a DOG also known as Screen Bugs (and has done since its launch), in the form of the yellow CBeebies logo, which rotates during the weekday segments at regular intervals to reveal a symbol for the segment; for example, the symbol for Discover and Do features a bug looking up at a rainbow. In the past, the channel has used different rotating DOGs including a dancing bug to promote Boogie Beebies.

It is the largest Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle conversion deployment program in history. The program is partially funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) through the United States Department of Energy Clean Cities Coalition. Overview The Program is converting approximately 1,100 vehicles from gasoline to propane autogas and implementing more than twenty propane autogas fueling stations. The program is administered by Virginia Clean Cities and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and is partially funded by an $8.6 million grant from the ARRA. The Program's website states that \\"under this large-scale initiative, public and private fleet vehicles in Washington D.C. and nine southeast states ... will be converted to propane autogas in order to reduce vehicle emissions, displace gasoline consumption and create American jobs.\\" Program goals The Program's stated goals include: * The displacement of an \\"estimated 15.7 million gallons of gasoline\\" * Elimination of an \\"estimated 16,000 tons or more of airborne pollutants\\" * The creation of \\"dozens of jobs\\" in the region The program has several types of public and private fleet participants, including law enforcement, municipal, and transportation service fleets, that are converting anywhere between 5 and 300 of their fleet vehicles to propane autogas. The vehicles are equipped with the PRINS VSI system and are bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they can switch from propane autogas to gasoline. Some fleets estimate they will save more than $100,000 in fuel costs annually with propane autogas. Additionally, autogas is a cleaner-burning transportation fuel and up to 90 percent of the U.S. supply is domestically produced. Cost share requirement This program, as well as other Clean Cities projects funded by ARRA grants, had a strict 50 percent cost-share requirement from the grant recipient and partners. AutoGas was selected by the program administrators to provide vehicle conversion equipment and to supply autogas fueling to fleet participants. The cost share provided by Alliance AutoGas and other program partners is estimated to be over $11 million. Leadership The program was conceived under the Virginia Clean Cities leadership of Chelsea Jenkins. It was later lead primarily by the program director, Peter Denbigh, and the assistant program director, Jamison Walker.

His primary role was as a left-arm spinner, but was regarded as a reasonable batsman. Pascall was related to the Constantine family; he was the maternal uncle of Elias and Learie Constantine and was a possible coaching influence on the latter.Howat, p. 28. At the time he played, critics considered him the best left-arm spinner in the West Indies.James, p. 54. Pascall was born in Diego Martin, Trinidad, at some time in 1886. His parents were Yoruba from West Africa who were brought to South America as slaves. According to family legend, Pascall's father, Ali, escaped as a child and sailed to Trinidad. Ali lived to be around 100 years old and maintained some African traditions in the family.Howat, pp. 19-20. Pascall first played for Trinidad in 1906, making his first-class debut and taking a wicket in the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament. From 1909, he played regularly in the team and appeared in the Inter-Colonial tournament until 1927. In total, he played 24 times for Trinidad to score 513 runs at a batting average of 15.08 and take 102 wickets at a bowling average of 17.39. He twice played innings of over 50 runs and took more than five wickets in six innings. He first represented a combined West Indies team in 1913 when he took four wickets for 83 runs for West Indies against a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team which was touring the region. Then in 1923, he was chosen as part of the West Indies team which toured England. Pascall played 19 matches on the tour and took 52 wickets at an average of 24.30. His best figures were five for 67 against Cambridge University and six for 77 against MCC at Lord's Cricket Ground. His final appearances for West Indies came in 1926. In 22 games for teams styled \\"West Indies\\" or \\"West Indians\\", Pascall hit 268 runs at an average of 10.31 and took 59 wickets at 25.20. In all first-class cricket, he 859 runs at 13.63, with a top score of 92 against Barbados in 1922, and took 171 wickets at 20.09, with best figures of six for 26 against British Guiana, also in 1922. In Trinidad, Pascall represented the Shannon team and was used as the third bowler. The Shannon club was made up of members of the black lower-middle classes,James, p. 50. and contained several international players. The team played in a highly competitive manner and were passionately supported by their spectators and, according to C. L. R. James, socially \\"represented the great mass of black people in the island.\\"James, pp. 54-55. Shannon players took part in games in a serious manner and were not given to smiling on the field, but Pascall, while a formidable opponent, was more friendly.James, p. 55. The people of Trinidad regarded Pascall with great affection,James, p. 80. and James described him as \\"a most charming person and a great popular favourite with all classes\\" on the island.James, p. 103. On one occasion in 1921, Pascall bowled particularly effectively in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, which was held in Trinidad that year, and James wrote some comic verses about how good his bowling was; these were well received by the public.James, p. 89. Pascall died on 7 July 1930.

Baron Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot (7 January 1764, in Mamirolle ‚Äì 11 June 1843) was a French general and a Governor of the Ionian Islands and Martinique. He was the son of Fran√ßois Donzelot and Jeanne- Baptiste Maire and had a brother named Joseph. He became a general of the French army in March 1801. Months later, he signed the surrender of Egypt to British forces. He then returned to France where he served in various high- echelon positions in Napoleon's army. Subsequently, he was appointed to serve as the head of the French garrison in Corfu and the Ionian Islands from 1807 to 1814. As governor, he resided in Corfu, where his gentle demeanour and mild manners made him popular with the Corfiotes. In 1808, he was named Baron of the Empire. In 1815, he was a divisional commander of Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Waterloo, during the 100-day return of Napoleon. After the defeat at Waterloo, he lost his position and did not work until 1817 when he was appointed governor of Martinique. Early career and French Revolutionary wars Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot entered the French army in 1785 as a private in the R√©giment Royal-La-Marine. In 1792 he was promoted to 2nd lieutenant in the 12th Regiment of Cavalry. In 1793 he became a lieutenant in the 22nd Regiment of Chasseurs. The same year he was promoted to adjudant-general in command of a battalion and in 1794 of a brigade. During the French Revolutionary Wars Donzelot served in the campaigns of the Army of the Rhine under the command of Pichegru and Moreau. In 1798 Donzelot served in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, distinguishing himself at Cairo and Battle of Heliopolis and in 1799 he was made a temporary general de brigade, the rank made permanent in 1801. After his return to France he served on the staff of the minister of war, Berthier. In 1804 to 1805 he served n the Army of Italy. In 1806-1807 he served under Andr√© Mass√©na and in the Siege of Gaeta. On 6 December 1807 Donzelot was promoted to general de division. British blockade of Corfu In 1807, French general C√©sar Berthier with 17,000 men landed in Corfu and took over control of the Russian-backed Septinsular Republic, according to the Treaty of Tilsit. Soon after, Berthier was replaced by General Donzelot. By order of the French Emperor Napoleon, Donzelot was entrusted with overseeing the reinforcement of the many fortifications of Corfu in anticipation of the British blockade. The French garrison in Corfu consisted of approximately 20,000 men, who were put under the leadership of General Donzelot, who was acknowledged as an intelligent, charming and capable leader. Captain Moubray, a British naval officer in command of HMS Active, after the refitting of his ship, was ordered to participate in the blockade of Corfu. During the blockade, the British captain captured several French ships, one of which carried the personal library of General Donzelot. Donzelot himself fled the scene in another boat. The British captain seized the opportunity of the capture of Donzelot's library and used it as a diplomatic tool and a gesture of goodwill aimed at improving the relations between the two men by returning it to Donzelot, as well as other property which happened to be seized from the French. The gesture of the British officer had the intended effect on Donzelot who not only acknowledged his appreciation of Captain Moubray's gesture in writing but he also treated any captured British officer from then on as a guest, by reserving for him a seat at his table. After the fall of Napoleon, Donzelot did not surrender, hoping that the French would be able to continue reinforcing their fortifications and use Corfu as a waypoint to Malta. Only after Louis XVIII ordered Donzelot to leave from Corfu in 1814 did the French finally surrender conditionally to the British and with this surrender the blockade of Corfu by the British came to an end. After the departure of the French forces from Corfu, the British under Sir James Campbell's command seized control of the Ionian islands. Greek struggle for independence In 1809, Theodoros Kolokotronis approached Donzelot, then governor of the Ionian Islands, and told him that he was planning to ask Napoleon for help with his plans to unseat Ali Pasha and his son Veli Pasha. Donzelot offered to mediate with Napoleon and to provide Kolokotronis with military and financial assistance. He was able to deliver on his promises and his assistance enabled Kolokotronis to recruit 3,000 men to fight against Ali Pasha. The plans, however, did not pan out the way Donzelot envisioned because the British came into the scene and Kolokotronis formed an alliance with them. Waterloo During the Hundred Days, Donzelot was the commander of the 2nd Infantry Division in the Army of the North, returning to active duty for Waterloo after a 16-year hiatus that saw him in the administrative role of Governor of the Ionian Islands while his colleagues were fighting in campaigns all over Europe. Before Waterloo, his last battle engagement was sixteen years prior in his participation in the Battle of the Pyramids as a commander of about 1000 men. Before his engagement at Waterloo, his other experience included being chief-of-staff for generals Desaix, Augereau, and Mass√©na. Consequently, his military skills were definitely outdated by the time he went to Waterloo. At the start of the engagement at Waterloo, his division suffered heavy losses when they were frontally attacked by the British I Corps and decisively defeated by British heavy cavalry. At 16:00 hours, Donzelot managed to regroup and, subsequently with the aid of the 1st Division, managed to take La Haye Sainte, although his victory did not last. Martinique After the Waterloo campaign, Donzelot's next appointment to a government position was as Governor of Martinique from 1818 to 1826. In 1819, he was named Comte. As governor of Martinique, Donzelot attempted to implement a military colonisation programme to increase the white population of the French West Indies by bringing poor white workers and farmers from France. His plan, however, was met with resistance from the local Creole elite who feared that the underprivileged immigrant workers would intermix with the free local population of mixed race people and was never implemented. During his tenure as governor of Martinique, Donzelot was also involved in an incident which gave rise to British concerns over French policy in the Caribbean. At the time, the French fleet unexpectedly started receiving reinforcements without providing any explanation to the British. Around the same time, Donzelot provided naval support for Spanish troops being deployed to Cuba. Because of these two events, the British became alarmed and proceeded to make quiet diplomatic enquiries to the French. George Canning, however, bypassed diplomatic niceties and demanded answers directly from the French government in Paris. From the French side, Fran√ßois-√âtienne de Damas was very apologetic and reassured the British side that Donzelot acted on his own initiative. On the other hand, another French respondent by the name of Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le admitted that Donzelot acted, on orders from Paris, to help Spain with maintaining control of Cuba. Upon hearing this, Canning immediately demanded from Vill√®le an unreserved denunciation of the Paris directives, which he managed to obtain. The French actions caused the British to fear that the French, by helping Spain in Cuba, would gradually become deeply involved in the affairs of the island and exert influence there. Death After 1826, Donzelot retired and lived a quiet life until his death. His name is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.

In 1919, she returned to Germany on a Quaker war relief mission and was asked by her sister, who had founded a children's home, to help establish a school with it. She and her family founded a boarding school, the Landschulheim Herrlingen in 1926, with Anna Essinger as headmistress. In 1933, with the Nazi threat looming and the permission of all the parents, she moved the school and its 66 children, mostly Jewish, to safety in England, re-establishing it as the Bunce Court School. During the war, Essinger established a reception camp for 10,000 German children sent to England on the Kindertransports, taking some of them into the school. After the war, her school took many child survivors of Nazi concentration camps.

Her task was to convince mayors, teachers and school rectors to set up kitchens so that children could have a hot meal once a day. She also collected food and clothing. In 1912, using her dowry, her sister, Klara Weimersheimer, founded an orphanage in Herrlingen, where she cared for problem children, as well as those mentally unstable and retarded. In 1925, as her own children and many of the children in care came of school age, she got the idea to turn the orphanage into a Landschulheim (boarding school). Several members of the Essinger family became involved, paving the way for it to open a year later. The Landschulheim Herrlingen opened on 1 May 1926 as a private boarding school with 18 children ranging in age from 6 to 12. Anna Essinger became headmistress and her sister Paula (1892‚Äì1975), a trained nurse, became the school nurse and its housekeeper.  Educational reform  While in the United States, Essinger learned about and became influenced by progressive education, then a new pedagogy.Peter Morley, \\"Peter Morley - A Life Rewound\\" Part 1 (PDF) British Academy of Film and Television Arts (2006), pp. 5-6. Retrieved September 29, 2011 She ran Landschulheim Herrlingen like a Montessori program, placing high value on communal living, mutual respect and a shared sense of responsibility for the school. Each and every one, whether teacher or pupil, was to feel responsible to the community. The school was non-denominational, accepting children from all religions, coeducational and the pupils were on a first name basis with the teachers, who also lived at the school. Essinger was described as a \\"formidable figure\\",Harold Jackson, \\"Anna's children\\" The Guardian (18 July 2003).

Most staff and pupils called her \\"Tante Anna\\" (Aunt Anna) or just TA, for short. The children learned two languages from the first day of school on, with emphasis on the spoken, rather than the written word. Essinger believed that children should have physical exercise before breakfast. and great emphasis was placed on physical exercise. Learning was accomplished through living, whether from daily walks in the woods, from the tasks required of the children in and around the building, or at meal time, where there were \\"English\\" and \\"French\\" tables and those sitting at them would speak in those languages during the meal. The arts were also offered. In addition to painting, drawing, singing and drama,Walter Block reminscense Quakers in Britain. Retrieved September 28, 2011 the children learned to play music. In the evening, Anna Essinger read a story and then gave each child a \\"good night kiss\\" before sending them off to bed. A 1927 report by the Ministry of Science, Art and Education (Ministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft, Kunst und Volksbildung) described Essinger as \\"extremely competent\\" and her teaching as \\"skillful, fresh and stimulating\\".  Nazi era  Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the growing Nazi threat were viewed ominously by Essinger, who immediately went about quietly boycotting the Third Reich. All public buildings were ordered to fly the Nazi flag with its swastika on Hitler's birthday in 1933, so Essinger planned a day of hiking for the pupils, leaving the flag to fly over an empty building. Essinger said, \\"Atop an empty building, the flag can neither convey nor harm as much.\\"Biography of Anna Essinger Anna Essinger Realschule Ulm. Retrieved September 29, 2011 She was denounced within the Nazi Party and the Nazi authorities' attitude toward the school became increasingly negative. It was recommended that an inspector be installed at the school. Essinger, realizing that her school had no future in Germany, and encouraged by her father to leave the country, began to look abroad for a new home for the school. After looking in Switzerland and the Netherlands, she found a property in southern England. The children's parents were informed and gave their approval for Essinger and her teachers to take 66 children out of Germany. Essinger arranged a well-disguised trip for the group and on September 5, 1933, they arrived in southern England. Astutely, Essinger did not formally close the school, but turned it over to Hugo Rosenthal. It became a home for Jewish children and a center for Jewish life in southern Germany, with an enrollment of more than 100 children.Joseph Walk (ed.), Kurzbiographien zur Geschichte der Juden 1918‚Äì1945. The Leo Baeck Institute, Jerusalem. Munich: Saur, (1988) , pp. 151 and 316 (Hugo Rosenthal) An old manor house dating from the time of Henry VIII was found in the village of Otterden near Faversham, in the County of Kent. The house was large, with extensive grounds, making it ideal for a boarding school. Funds were meager, so work on the property was done by the staff and pupils, causing British education inspectors to view the new school unfavorably at the outset.Photos and short history of Bunce Court Town of Faversham website. \\"Bunce Court, Otterden\\" Retrieved September 28, 2011 In 1933, England was still secure and war had not yet broken out and people were not aware of what was going on in Germany and why Essinger and the school had left. Within a year or two, however, enough improvements had been made that local officials realized the school was quite special; Essinger won the respect of the local authorities and had advocates from all areas of public life. She sought English host families for children to visit on weekends; and at the school, held concerts, theatrical programs, sports contests and an annual \\"Open Day\\", involving the children in English life and the community with the school. After Kristallnacht, on 9‚Äì10 November 1938, Essinger was asked to set up a reception camp in Dovercourt for 10,000 German children who would be arriving on the Kindertransports. Essinger, then nearly 60 years old, worked with three teachers, her cook and six of the older pupils to establish the camp, taking some of them into her school. With this, she also sought out families and homes to care for refugee children. Local British committees sought out placements for the children and tried to match children with families where they would fit in. However, the manner in which it was done appalled Essinger, who likened it to a \\"cattle market\\", where attractive children were chosen, but less attractive ones were not, lowering morale.Veronica Gillespie, \\"Working with the Kindertransports\\" in: Sybil Oldfield (ed.), This working day world: women's lives and culture(s) in Britain, 1914-1945.

Essinger and about 100 children and teachers relocated the school to \\"Trench Hall\\" in Shropshire. They were not able to return to Bunce Court until 1946. Having finished her life's work, Essinger closed the school in 1948 and retired.  Later years  Over the course of 22 years, Essinger cared for and taught over 900 children. As the Nazis extended their reach, the children came first from Germany, then Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and England. The last years were particularly difficult. Her eyesight was failing, but more significantly, the last children to arrive at her school were Nazi concentration camp survivors who no longer knew what normal life was like, and sometimes found it very difficult to adjust to. After she closed her school, Essinger spent her remaining years living at Bunce Court, and maintained correspondence with her former pupils. She helped both children and adults in distress with her motto, \\"Give children a hand, give them a chance\\".  Legacy and honours  Commemorative plaque for Anna Essinger in downtown Ulm Many of Essinger's pupils went on to distinguished careers, including Frank Auerbach, Leslie Brent, Gerard Hoffnung, Frank Marcus, Peter Morley, and Helmut and Richard Sonnenfeldt. Bunce Court alumni returned at every opportunity while the school was still in existence; after it closed, they held reunions for 55 years. In 1959, in honour of Essinger's 80th birthday, Bunce Court alumni planted a grove of trees in Israel that was named after her. In 1990, a realschule in Ulm and a Kuhberg gymnasium (secondary school) were named for Anna Essinger. Some of her personal papers are archived at the Ida Seele Archive in Dillingen an der Donau. The archive is devoted to research of the history of education and social pedagogy.

The novel recounts the return of the shell shocked Captain Chris Baldry from the trenches of the First World War from the perspective of his cousin Jenny. The novel grapples with the soldier's return from World War I with mental trauma and its effects on the family, as well as the light it sheds on their fraught relationships. Though initially reviewed by critics, literary scholars treating West's work tended to focus on her later novels and dismissed The Return of the Soldier until the end of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty first. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1982, and later into a stage musical of the same name in 2014 by Charles Miller. Background The Return of the Soldier is Rebecca's West's first novel. It was published in 1918 during World War I. Plot summary The novel begins as the narrator, Jenny, describes her cousin by marriage, Kitty Baldry, pining in the abandoned nursery where her dead first son would have been raised. Occupied with the domestic management of the Baldry estate just outside London, the two are almost completely removed from the horrors of war. The only exception is that Kitty's husband, Chris Baldry, is a British soldier fighting in France. While Kitty laments in the nursery, Margaret Grey arrives at the estate bringing news to the two women. When Jenny and Kitty meet her, they are surprised to find a drab middle-aged woman. And even more to their shock, Margaret tells them that the War Office notified her of Chris's injury and return home, not Kitty and Jenny. Kitty dismisses Margaret from the estate trying to deny that she could have been the recipient of such information. Soon after, another of Jenny's cousins notifies the two women that he in fact has visited Chris and that he is obsessing over Margaret, whom he had had a summer fling with 15 years before. Soon after, Chris returns shell-shocked to the estate believing he is still 20, but finding himself in a strange world which had aged 15 years beyond his memory. Trying to understand what is real for Chris, Jenny asks Chris to explain what he feels to be true. Chris tells her the story of a romantic summer on Monkey Island, where Chris at the age of 20 fell in love with Margaret, the inn- keeper's daughter. The summer ends with a rash departure by Chris in a fit of jealousy. After Chris tells this story, Jenny travels to nearby Wealdstone to bring Margaret back to help Chris understand the difference between his remembered past and reality. She arrives at Margaret's dilapidated row-house to find her dishevelled and taking care of her husband. Jenny convinces Margaret to return with her to the estate to help Chris. Upon Margaret's return, Chris recognises her and becomes excited. Before returning to her home, Margaret explains that 15 years have passed since their Monkey Island summer and that Chris is now married to Kitty. Chris acknowledges this passage of time intellectually but cannot retrieve his memories and still pines for Margaret. Margaret continues to visit, and Jenny's initial dislike for the woman turns to friendship, gratitude, and eventually, near hero-worship as she realises that Margaret has an inner goodness that transcends her desperate appearance and class standing. Jenny recognises the artifice of the house she and Kitty have so painstakingly decorated for Chris is a poor substitute for the love and temporary home he finds in Margaret. Jenny spends a lot of the time lamenting her inability to be part of this Chris-Margaret inner sanctum. Jenny goes on at length describing the conflict between this grief over her lost closeness with her cousin and admiration for Margaret, Chris and their relationship. Meanwhile, Kitty continues to despair about Chris's memory loss and his attachment to Margaret. Unlike Jenny, she refuses to see Margaret and does not respect the truth that this new/old relationship is doing Chris some good. Truthfully, the only time Chris is happy is when he is with Margaret. Kitty is not satisfied that he cannot be cured and one day announces the impending arrival of a Dr Gilbert Anderson, a psychoanalyst. Dr. Anderson, expected to take a novel tack, arrives during one of Margaret's visits and questions the women. Margaret perceptively recommends a course of treatment: Margaret must confront Chris with the existence of his late son, Oliver, who died at age two, five years ago. Margaret knows Chris will not be able to deny reality if he has to deny his child. Jenny leads Margaret to the sad, well- maintained room where Oliver once lived. Margaret grieves for her own child whose death at the same age and time as Oliver's makes her feel a connection between the two. Amid this pain, Margaret and Jenny contemplate not \\"curing\\" Chris and instead letting him just be happy. But Jenny realises Chris will have no dignity if he has no truth and almost simultaneously, Margaret voices a similar thought. The final scene of the book has Jenny watching from the house as Margaret confronts Chris with the truth of Oliver. Impatiently, Kitty wonders what is going on. Jenny recognises, even from a distance, that Chris' whole bearing has changed and he is no longer trapped in his youth. He is a soldier again, or as Kitty exclaims \\"He's cured!\\" Jenny's silence on the subject leads us to reflect on whether this cure is really a good thing after all. He will lose the love of his life and have to return to the horrors of the war, and, if he survives, the superficial life he has had with Kitty and Jenny. Characters Chris Baldry is an upper class gentlemen who chafes against the upper class expectations he is supposed to meet. His amnesia- filled return reveals someone who has a suppressed \\"romantic sensibility\\" according to critic Carl Rollyson. As Jenny comments in the book, he \\"was not like other city men\\"; he had a \\"great faith in the improbable.\\"Rollyson 25‚Äì27 Throughout the novel, Chris is treated simply as the \\"soldier\\" and is often not given a full examination by Jenny as the narrator, thus his character is flat, an individual stuck in his masculine function in society. Kitty Baldry on the other hand, is neoclassical in her outlook. Instead of the romantic optimism which Chris exhibits throughout the novel, Kitty's life revolves around the \\"proper forms\\" of an upperclass performance. Obsessed with self- control, good breeding, manners and making life tidy and comfortable, Kitty creates a facade of happiness which she projects on Baldry Court. Margaret is a character cast in strong contrast with Kitty. Appearing like a worn out lower class woman, to whom the narrator Jenny initially feels hostility, Margaret reveals herself as both thoughtful and aware, both revealing the illusions in Baldry Court to Jenny and supporting and expanding Dr. Anderson's analysis of Chris's psychological state. As noted above, Jenny is the narrator of the story, the cousin (through marriage) to Kitty. Style West's style in her early novels, including The Return of the Soldier, is characteristic of other British Modernist novelists. She uses a limited point of view, a non- linear narration, and offers themes of memory, sexual desire and the importance of nuanced detail. Temporal displacement and uncertainty pervade most of the novel, especially in the way Chris's shell shock displaces him, and subsequently the reader, during his story telling. This additional shift beyond simply the period at war in France reinforces the idea that his trauma could be linked to his marriage with Kitty, or any number of other events. Additionally, Chris's sense of time is repeatedly broken throughout the novel and communicated through Jenny. The limited unreliable narrator in The Return of the Soldier is Jenny, who is cousin to Chris, the soldier whom the title evokes. As the novel develops, Jenny's sympathies and attention shift from Kitty to Margaret. This dual focus on Kitty and Margaret make the novel more about the women and less about Chris, the title character. Themes =Soldier's return= The title The Return of the Soldier embodies a common trope in Great War literature: soldiers return from war and interact with everyday life, confronting trauma sustained through the brutality of war. The Return of the Soldier is the first deliberate evocation of the returned soldier in literature. West's treatment of the returning soldier in The Return of the Soldier is deliberately distanced from the war. The trauma Chris suffers in The Return of the Soldier becomes an isolated piece of evidence of the war's effect on a society that appears to be otherwise functioning normally. This distance is very similar to the distance from war and its trauma in Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room. The successful treatment of the traumatised returned soldier is a fundamental element of The Return of the Soldier. Unlike Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and Dorothy L. Sayers' The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, other postwar novels which emphasise the lingering effects of war despite attempts at reintegration, The Return of the Soldier lends a certain optimism that the soldier can be reintegrated into society. West's novel depicts war trauma as curable. =Psychoanalysis= Freudian psychoanalysis and its tools for understanding the psychological state of an individual are important to the novel. Freud and the idea of psychoanalysis were popular during the time when West was writing the novel, and the focus on psychoanalysis is fundamental to the conclusion of the book. In the conclusion, Chris is miraculously cured after his subconscious is first analysed and then confronted by the doctor and Margaret. Despite West's expressing in 1928 that the novel is not focused on psychoanalysis, critics have paid close attention to it, often criticising the simplicity of the psychoanalytic solution to Chris's traumatic amnesia. The rapidity of the recovery, and the failure of the reader to witness the conversation between Margaret and Chris are often cited by several critics, especially Wolfe, Orel, Gledhill and Sokoloff. Literary scholars Cristina Pividori, Wyatt Bonikowski and Steve Pinkerton all seek to challenge the negative reception of the psychological tools in the novel. Bonowskie dissects the novel in light of the discussion of World War I proposed by Freud in \\"Thoughts for the Times on War and Death\\" and Beyond the Pleasure Principle and says that Freud and West came to similar conclusions on the effect of war on the human ego: that war shatter's the defence mechanisms which the ego has created to defend itself. Pividori argues that West has a more complex understanding of the human psyche than Freud does. Pividori argues that West doesn't believe that the soldier must relive the trauma to reconcile it within himself as Freud argues. In West's assessment of the situation, the soldier's desire to survive leads him to a search for love and life so that he may communicate the atrocities which he has witnessed. Pinkerton argues that the end of The Return of the Soldier points to Margaret as a character and individual who is extremely adept in analysing and in tune with Chris and that the actual event is plausible within current psychoanalytic theory. Pinkerton even goes so far as to suggest that the very nature of the trauma and kind of cure necessary to resolve Chris's trauma means that \\"The scene of Chris's cure, then cannot be written\\" because the resolution is simply unable to be described effectively. Critical reception In May 1918, Lawrence Gilman reviewed The Return of the Soldier in The North American Review as \\"The Book of the Month.\\" Amid his commentary on the elusiveness of any information about West from her or her publisher, Lawrence gave the book praise calling it \\"an authentic masterpiece, a one-act drama of [war] with music.\\" In his review, he praised her language and ability to provide realist level detail. Additionally, he applauded West for treating a romantic subject without becoming sentimental. Later literary critics neglected The Return of the Soldier until the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first. Earlier criticism was characterised by a negative response, often dismissing the novel on grounds of amateurishness of execution in both its style and use of thematic tools such as its use of Freudian psychoanalysis. The more recent critics have focused on the complexity of the novel, its expressing multiple themes, including feminist issues, the role of women in patriarchal society, war and trauma, and masculinity and war. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1928 it was adapted by the writer John Van Druten into a play of the same title which ran for 46 performances at the Playhouse Theatre in London's West End. The novel was made into a 1982 film starring Alan Bates as Baldry and co-starring Julie Christie, Ian Holm, Glenda Jackson, and Ann-Margret.

In a most recent publication, it alleged it had evidence linking Pres Bingu wa Mutharika and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to the arson attack of offices of the Institute for Policy Interaction (IPI) of activist Rafiq Hajat. Chasowa was also affiliated with the group, New Vision Youth Organization group that concerned itself with socioeconomic issues in Malawi and sought dialogue with the President. =Play= Prior to his death he co-wrote a play \\"Semo\\" with Thlupego Chisiza (son of Dunduzu Chisiza Jr) that was critical of the governments human rights policies. The play was performed at Lions Theater in Blantyre by Chisiza and this led to Chisiza's arrest. Death The week before his death, plain clothes police officers went to the Polytechnic University of Malawi, to question administrators on the existence of a political pressure group, YFD. The students called this move illegal and contrary to the Kampala Declaration which grants academic freedom. They arrested YFD members, including the President \\"Black Moses\\" who is still missing. On Saturday, September 24, 2011, Chasowa was found dead at the Polytechnic campus with a deep cut on his head and lying in blood. Police have ruled his death a suicide. Police say that Chasowa jumped from a five-story building on September 24, 2011. Inspector General of Police Peter Mukhito noted that he was identified by the leader of the student group, \\"Black Moses\\", as the author and distributor of anti- government newsletters which prompted him to commit suicide due to fear. Police say he left a note stating he was killing himself because \\"politics are dangerous.\\" His sister, family and activists however have noted that there says was a hole under his chin, and that the medical report reported no fractured limbs, only head injuries indicating wounds inconsistent with a fall from a 5 story building. =Funeral= Chasowa's funeral was held on September 26, 2011 and was attended by thousands of University of Malawi students from Malawi Polytechnic and Chancellor College (Chanco) student union representatives. It was also attended by fired university professor Dr.Jessie Kabwila-Kapasula and Dr. Edge Kanyongolo who gained notoriety in the academic freedom stand off. Dr. Kabwila-Kapasula was dressed in red with a cloth around her mouth to symbolize the silencing of voices of discontent. A red cloth was placed on his grave by Kabwila-Kapasula. Red is the color worn by protesters during the July 21, 2011 Malawi nationwide protests as a symbol of ‚Äúdiscontent‚Äù among Malawians against the deteriorating social, economic and political in Malawi under the Bingu wa Mutharika administration. The director of religious affairs for the People‚Äôs Party (PP), Reverend Malani Mtonga was in attendance. At the home of the Chasowa United Democratic Front (Malawi) national chairman and former Vice-President of Malawi Dr Cassim Chilumpha, deputy secretary general Hophmally Makande, UDF second vice president Humphrey Mvula, UDF director of campaign Davies Chester Katsonga were in attendance.

Andrews is the founder and president of the biotechnology company Sierra Sciences. In 1997, he led the team at Geron Corporation that was the first to successfully identify human telomerase. Early life and education Andrews was born on December 10, 1951, to television producer Ralph Andrews and Margaret Andrews. As a child, Andrews was told by his father that he should grow up to become a doctor and find a cure for aging. Andrews graduated from Cate School in 1971, from University of California, San Diego in 1976, and earned his Ph.D. in Molecular and Population Genetics at the University of Georgia in 1981. =Early career (1981‚Äì1999)= Andrews first worked at the biotechnology company Armos Corporation, which was later purchased by Codon Corporation, which in turn was purchased by Berlex Biosciences, now known as Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. In 1993, Andrews convinced Berlex to send him to an anti-aging conference at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where he met Calvin Harley of Geron Corporation. Harley gave a speech on the subject of telomeres and telomerase, their discovery in the organism Tetrahymena by Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and on the possible connection between telomeres and aging. Harley mentioned that no one had yet been successful in cloning telomerase in human beings. After the speech, Andrews approached Harley and told him that he could clone human telomerase for Geron in three months. Harley took him up on this offer and hired Andrews as Geron's Director of Molecular Biology. Three months and seventeen days later, Andrews' team successfully cloned the RNA component of telomerase (\\"hTR\\"). For this discovery, Andrews and members of his team were awarded second place for \\"National Inventor of the Year\\" in 1997 by the Intellectual Property Owners Association (first place having been awarded for the invention of protease inhibitors.) Andrews' team later co-discovered the protein component of human telomerase (\\"hTERT\\") as well. Further experiments by Geron Scientists demonstrated that the protein component of telomerase was inducible, and that when the gene for that component was inserted into normal human skin cells, they could divide past the Hayflick limit and essentially stopped exhibiting replicative senescence (Bodnar, Andrea G., et al. \\"Extension of life-span by introduction of telomerase into normal human cells.\\" science 279.5349 (1998): 349-352.), a likely cause of aging. Years later, these cells were deemed immortal. Typically, the only immortal human cells are our germline and most cancers. =Sierra Sciences (1999‚Äìpresent)= In 1999, Andrews founded Sierra Sciences in Reno, Nevada, to capitalize on his discoveries at Geron, with the specific goal of curing human aging. Underwritten by investors Richard Offerdahl and Pierluigi Zappacosta, Andrews assembled a team to search for a small molecule that would bind to the telomerase repressor, causing the body to constitutively express telomerase in the presence of that molecule. From 1999 to 2005, Sierra Sciences' focus was to identify the telomerase repressor protein, in the hopes that a drug could be specifically designed to bind to it. During this time frame, Geron Corporation discovered TA-65, a small-molecule telomerase activator derived from Astragalus membranaceus. Sierra Sciences tested its efficacy, and shortly thereafter, Andrews became the first paying customer to take the supplement. In 2005, Andrews shelved Sierra Sciences' efforts to identify the telomerase repressor protein, instead switching to the \\"brute force\\" strategy of developing assays to screen large numbers of semi-random chemicals to determine whether they induced telomerase. In November 2007, after nearly two years of screening, Sierra Sciences discovered the chemical C0056784, which induces approximately 6% as much telomerase as is found in the immortal cancer cell line HeLa. In 2008, using C0057684 as a positive control, Sierra Sciences developed a much more sensitive real-time PCR based high-throughput screening assay, the \\"hTERT RT-PCR assay,\\" with which they were able to screen 4,000 chemicals per week. In 2010, Andrews and Sierra Sciences entered into an agreement with John Anderson, founder of Isagenix International, to use this assay to screen natural ingredients for telomerase activity. A year later, based on the assay's results, Isagenix launched Product B, a telomere- supporting nutraceutical Personal life Andrews is an accomplished ultramarathon runner, frequently running races as long as 138 miles long. In 2008 and 2009, Andrews successfully completed the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile race through Death Valley in temperatures exceeding 120 ¬∞F (49 ¬∞C). Andrews is the subject of the 2014 documentary film The Immortalists.

It ran from via Redditch, Alcester and Evesham to . It was sometimes known as the Gloucester loop line of the Midland Railway. It opened in stages between 1859 and 1868, built by the Redditch Railway, the Midland Railway as its Evesham branch (from Ashchurch), and the Evesham and Redditch Railway. All these sections were affiliated to the Midland Railway and amalgamated with it. When complete, the line formed a useful route for goods services avoiding the congested and difficult route via the Lickey Incline. It became more important when a line from Stratford on Avon to Broom was opened in 1879, bringing through goods traffic to the route. Long-distance goods services were diverted away from the line over other routes after 1960, and the line declined steeply. It was closed south of Redditch in stages in 1962 and 1963. The short branch from Barnt Green to Redditch has enjoyed a revival of its passenger services in recent years. A very short length of the original line serves an MoD depot at Ashchurch, but the remainder of the line has no railway activity. Birmingham and Gloucester Railway The Evesham loop line in 1868The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway opened throughout in 1840. With the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, it formed a through route between the dominant manufacturing districts of the West Midlands, and the important port of Bristol. The principal objective of the promoters of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was to achieve a trunk route between those important centres, and in devising its route, they paid little heed to the agricultural districts of the Vale of Evesham, (\\"one of Britain‚Äôs richest\\"Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1981, 0 7153 8004 4, page 58) and other areas of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. Redditch Railway Redditch railway stationRedditch was an important town not far from the Bristol and Gloucester Railway route, but it was not until 23 July 1858 that the Redditch Railway was incorporated. The line was to leave the Midland Railway main line at Barnt Green and run to Brock Hill Lane, Redditch, a distance of about miles. Authorised capital was ¬£35,000 in ¬£10 shares, with the usual addition of loans of ¬£11,500. The line opened to passengers on 19 September 1859, and to goods traffic on 1 October of the same year. There was no other station, until Alvechurch was opened in November 1859. The line was leased and worked from the outset by the Midland Railway.Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 292Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 467 The take-up of the ¬£35,000 share issue was disappointing: only ¬£27,120 was taken. Worse, the actual cost of construction of the line amounted to ¬£54,574. The deficit on capital account was ¬£27,000, presumably partly supported by unauthorised loans. The Company went back to Parliament for authorisation for further capital, and an Act of 7 August 1862 allowed the Company to raise fresh share capital to the extent of ¬£15,000, and to take loans of up to ¬£5,000, and to create debenture stock in lieu of loans.John M Tolson, Birmingham and Gloucester Loop, in Railway Magazine, November 1964Leslie Oppitz, Hereford & Worcester Railways Remembered, Countryside Books, Newbury, 1990, , pages 31 to 33R J Essey, An Illustrated History of the Ashchurch to Barnt Green Line: The Evesham Route, Oxford Publishing Co, Hersham, 2002, , page 21 The company was merged with the Midland Railway in 1863; the change was ratified by the Midland Railway (Additional Powers) Act 1874. Ashchurch and Evesham branch The Evesham loop line in 1879The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened its main line through Evesham in 1852. The Midland Railway saw the potential of the town, and determined to build its own line to Evesham. It obtained authorisation of a ten-mile Ashchurch and Evesham branch, by the Midland Railway (New Lines) Act of 7 June 1861. It was opened to goods trains on 1 July 1864, and to passengers on 1 October 1864; the Evesham station was immediately adjacent to the OW&WR; station. On weekdays there were four trains in each direction on weekdays and two on Sundays. After a short time there were two trains running through to Gloucester. Evesham and Redditch Railway Evesham had two railway lines, but interested parties there saw the advantage of a direct connection to Birmingham, and they supported a proposed Evesham and Redditch Railway. The line was to be 17 miles in length. The Evesham and Redditch Railway was incorporated by the Evesham and Redditch Railway Act of 13 July 1863; authorised capital was ¬£189,600. The company was leased to the Midland Railway on incorporation.Carter, page 344Grant, pages 193 and 194 Part of the line, from Evesham to Alcester, a distance of nearly ten miles, opened to goods traffic on 16 June 1866. Colonel Yolland for the Board of Trade approved passenger opening, and passenger trains started running on 17 September 1866. Four trains ran daily between Alcester and Evesham, with two on Sundays, and after a short period these were combined with the Ashchurch trains, but the Gloucester through trains had been discontinued. This opening left 7 miles between Alcester and Redditch to be completed; there was a 330-yard tunnel under the southern end of the town at Redditch. The line was completed on 4 May 1868. The Redditch Railway's terminus station was closed and a through station was opened about a quarter of a mile to the south.Essery, pages 21 and 22 The new location was more convenient to the town centre. Between Redditch and Evesham the line comprised single track with passing loops; from Evesham to Ashchurch the track was double throughout. The company was vested in the Midland by the Midland Railway (Additional Powers) Act 1882. Working arrangements, and absorption The Evesham branch (from Ashchurch) was part of the Midland Railway; the other two companies forming the through route, the Redditch Railway and the Evesham and Redditch Railway, were worked from their respective openings by the Midland company. The Redditch Railway was absorbed by the Midland Railway from 1 January 1865 (under powers in the Midland Railway (New Lines and Additional Powers) Act of 21 July 1863). The Evesham and Redditch Railway was vested in the Midland Railway from 1 July 1882, and the company was finally dissolved on 25 June 1886. The Midland Railway had acquired a highly competitive access to Birmingham and to all parts of the country for the Vale of Evesham's fruit and vegetable products; at the same time the OW&WR; east-to-west route (by now GWR) had become less strategically important. The line from Stratford on Avon Broom Junction stationA line was built from Stratford-upon-Avon joining the Evesham Loop at Broom: the line was built by the Evesham, Redditch & Stratford-on-Avon Junction Railway. This railway was an extension of a line from Fenny Compton to Stratford-on-Avon, called the East and West Junction Railway. The E&WJR; aspired to carry Northamptonshire iron ore to South Wales via Stratford and beyond but had run out of money, and was in the hands of the receiver in 1879 when the Evesham company opened its line. The line ran from the E&WJR; at Stratford to connect with the Evesham Loop line at Broom, between Alcester and Evesham. Its authorising Act gave it running powers over the Midland Railway between Redditch and Evesham, although these were never exercised except for access to the station at Broom. The line opened on 2 June 1879, and was worked by the E&WJR.;R C Riley and Bill Simpson, A History of the Stratford-upon-Avon & Midland Junction Railway, Lamplight Publications, Banbury, 1999, , page 13Essery, page 28 The connection at Broom faced north, away from South Wales; at first the point of junction was in the middle of a Midland Railway staff section on the single line (Wixford to Salford Priors), a highly improper situation. This was rectified soon after the line opened. Broom station was an exchange station only, with no public access, until 1 November 1880. The ER&SoAJR; itself went into receivership in 1886. In 1909 those two companies merged to form the Stratford-on-Avon and Midland Junction Railway. Alcester Railway The Alcester Railway company, authorised on 6 August 1872, constructed a branch line from Bearley on the Stratford on Avon Railway to Alcester. In fact it made a junction with the Midland Railway a short distance north of Alcester station; the Alcester Railway had running powers into the Midland Railway station. The branch was opened on 4 September 1876; it was worked by the Great Western Railway. The Alcester Company was finally taken over by the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1883.Essery, page 29 Broom south curve The junction at Broom with the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway faced north. For a time the Midland Railway used the SoA&MJR; line as a through goods link between its system in Northamptonshire and the Gloucestershire network, but the poor facilities of the route and the necessity to reverse at Broom to continue the journey over the Evesham Loop line militated against it. Nevertheless, during World War II a heavy traffic over that route developed; the track and signalling on the Stratford line was greatly improved for the purpose. The trains still had to reverse at Broom, and the delays involved in doing so with heavy trains became intolerable. To relieve the situation a south curve was built at Broom, creating a triangle. It opened on 27 September 1942.Essery, page 76Riley and Simpson, page 49 Evesham connection The Midland Railway and the OW&WR; (later GWR) were alongside one another at Evesham, and for many years there was only an exchange siding connection between the two. In the 1950s a running connection was made, to enable Honeybourne ‚Äì Cheltenham services to be diverted that way to Ashchurch. Developments from 1960 A frequent regular interval passenger service was introduced between Birmingham and Redditch in April 1960. This greatly reduced the availability of paths for freight trains over the single- track section north of Redditch, and nearly all through freight traffic passing over this section was diverted to the main line via the Lickey Incline. Meanwhile there was an increase in the Woodford Halse to South Wales traffic from Broom Junction, and in 1960 a double-track east-to-south spur was constructed at Stratford on Avon. This enabled all the Woodford Halse traffic to be diverted to the Honeybourne route, leaving only local goods services, and the Oxford-South Wales freight trains running over the Evesham-Ashchurch section. Broom station was closed on 1 October 1962, a few months after the line from Broom West to Broom East had closed on 1 July 1962. On 1 October 1962 the Alcester-Evesham section was closed temporarily to all traffic without warning, because of \\"the unsafe condition of the line\\". Next the double-track Evesham-Ashchurch section was closed on 9 September 1963, because of the considerable expenditure necessary to maintain the track for heavy freight movements. The section between Evesham and Ashchurch soon followed, closing for passengers on 17 June 1963. Passenger services Passenger services between Redditch and Ashchurch have shown little variation over the years, normally consisting of four or five trains in each direction on weekdays at roughly three-hourly intervals. These were a mixture of through trains and trains between Redditch, Evesham and Ashchurch connecting with other services to and from Birmingham. In the early years there were 13 trains in each direction between Birmingham and Redditch on weekdays with an extra late train on Thursdays and Saturdays. After the Second World War, services were reduced, only nine trains running, with some unhelpful gaps. An hourly diesel service was introduced between Birmingham and Redditch on 25 April 1960. Peak-hour trains and through workings to Evesham and Ashchurch continued to be steam hauled. Closure In 1962, British Railways announced the intention of withdrawing passenger services on the 28-mile stretch between Redditch and Ashchurch. The proposals originally entailed the complete closure of Harvington and Ashton-under-Hill stations and the retaining of facilities for full wagon loads at Hinton, with all other stations remaining for freight and parcels traffic. But further developments caused all stations on the branch south of Alcester, except Evesham, to be closed completely from 1 July 1963.

He was elected to the Texas Senate in November 2016. Previously, Hughes was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 2003 through January 2017. In 2002, Hughes was elected as state representative for District 5, which includes Camp, Harrison, Upshur, and Wood counties in the northeastern section of Texas. Background Hughes was born in Quitman, the county seat of Wood County, but reared in a blue-collar family in nearby Mineola. He graduated in 1987 from Mineola High School and thereafter enrolled at Tyler Junior College. In 1992, he earned his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Texas at Tyler. Hughes was the first member of his family to receive a college education. In 1995, Hughes completed his Juris Doctor degree from Baptist-affiliated Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas. He clerked for the U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas William M. Steger of Texas. In 2003, he joined the Lanier law firm in Mineola. Legislative service Hughes was elected to the legislature in 2002, when he upset the incumbent Democratic Representative Bob D. Glaze (1927‚Äì2010) of Gilmer in Upshur County. Hughes polled 20,286 votes (52.4 percent) to Glaze's 18,451 (47.6 percent). In the 2004 general election, Glaze sought a rematch with Hughes but lost, 23,029 votes (38 percent) to the Republican's 37,529 (62 percent). In 2006, no Democrat filed against Hughes, as he defeated the Libertarian Timothy J. Carmichael, 26,286 (81.9 percent) to 5,795 (18.1 percent). Hughes was unopposed in the 2010 general election, when Republicans carried 101 of the 150 seats in the state House. In 2011, Hughes served on the House Agriculture and Livestock and the Human Services committees though his committee assignments have varied during his House tenure. Strongly pro-life, Hughes worked to secure passage in 2011 of the state law which requires women procuring abortions to undergo a sonogram to witness the development of the fetus prior to termination. On March 19, 2011, Hughes dedicated the Mineola Nature Preserve, a conservation project which began in 2002, the year he was first elected to the state House. The preserve includes nearly three thousand acres along the Sabine River, which are inhabited by almost two hundred animal species; the preserve also includes trails for visitors, an area of wetland, and locations for birdwatchers. The two-acre Pullen Pond is funded by Ozarka Brand Spring Water. On September 13, 2011, Hughes called upon then Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to investigate a new air pollution rule of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Abbott indicated that he is already checking into the issue raised by Hughes. According to Hughes, the rule if implemented had the potential of producing blackouts, increasing costs to consumers, and creating job losses. Hughes added that the directive would cause the Luminant utility company to shut down operations in his own district as well as across the state. Hughes continued, \\"I don't know what's going on in Washington, but here in the real world, money is tight, and families are struggling. . . . As if the job losses weren‚Äôt enough, these new rules will also raise electric rates ‚Äì in the middle of a recession.\\" Dispute with Speaker Straus Hughes initially pledged to support a second term for Republican Joe Straus of San Antonio as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. However, after the 2010 elections, Hughes withdrew his support for Straus on the grounds that Straus had punished intraparty conservative opponents with redistricting. Straus nevertheless retained the speakership and won an easy re-nomination in 2016. Hughes based his charge on a conversation with one of Straus' staffers, who allegedly notified Hughes that plans were already being laid to alter Straus' opponents' districts. Hughes said that he was informed that efforts were especially aimed at two East Texas members, then Representative-elect Erwin Cain of Sulphur Springs and Dan Flynn of Van. Representative Chuck Hopson of Jacksonville, a Democrat- turned-Republican and chairman of the House Ethics Committee, called upon Hughes to reveal the name of the informant. Hopson had received $42,000 in contributions from Straus.\\"Rep. Chuck Hopson, Who Chairs Ethics Panel Investigating Allegation Against Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, Received $42K,\\" Texas Watchdog, November 22, 2010 Chuck Hopson identified the informant as District 62 Representative Larry Phillips, an attorney from Sherman and a member of the Ethics Committee. Phillips removed himself as a committee member for the hearing and denied Hughes's accusation. The phone call was not recorded. The committee did not reach a judgment because of the lack of corroborating witnesses. Hughes was renominated in the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012. He polled 13,015 votes (77.7 percent) to 3,744 (22.4 percent) for his opponent, Mary Lookadoo. No Democrat opposed him the November 6 general election. After his 2012 renomination, Hughes announced that he would attempt to unseat Speaker Straus in 2013. However, in December after six months of attempting to line up needed commitments from colleagues, Hughes exited the contest. His conservative colleague and state Senate opponent in 2016, Representative David Simpson of Longview, then entered the contest for Speaker, with Hughes's full support. However, Simpson withdrew before the balloting for Speaker began, and Straus was reelected without opposition on January 8, 2013.Legislature opens; Straus re-elected\\", Laredo Morning Times, January 9, 2013, p. 10A 2016 Texas Senate election When the moderate Republican and former Tyler Mayor Kevin Eltife announced his retirement from the state Senate after thirteen years service, Hughes and Simpson entered the Republican primary to succeed Eltife. Eliminated in the March 1 primary was the two-star United States Army General James K. \\"Red\\" Brown of Lindale, who polled 28,285 votes (21.25 percent). Brown trailed David Simpson, the second- placed candidate, by 13 votes. Simpson received 28,288 votes (21.26 percent) in the primary. In fourth place was Mike Lee with 12,630 (9.5 percent). Hughes handily led the primary with 63,844 votes (48 percent) but short of a majority in a multi-candidate field. Hughes carried the backing of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the presiding officer of the state Senate. In the runoff election on May 24, 2016, Hughes defeated fellow State Representative David Simpson, 27,348 (69.3 percent) to 12,105 (30.7 percent). He faced no Democratic opponent in the November 8 general election. Two other Republicans, Cole Hefner and Jay Misenheimer, competed in the primary runoff for the District 5 seat that Hughes vacated. Hefner led the primary with 12,759 votes (46 percent); Misenheimer finished second in a five-candidate primary field with 7,524 votes (27.1 percent). Hefner then won the runoff, 6,989 (60.4 percent) to Misenheimer's 4,582 (39.6 percent). Like Hughes, Hefner faced no Democrat in the general election.
