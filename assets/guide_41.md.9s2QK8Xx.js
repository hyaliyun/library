Background The single was released on 7 December 1998, becoming the sixth overall single from the album. As an ode to the city of the same name in California, the song partly talks of Darren Hayes' experiences and observations. The lyrics of the chorus also make reference to novelist Norman Mailer. The cover art for the single was also used for two other releases: the 1998 re release of \\"I Want You\\" in the United Kingdom, and the release of \\"Tears of Pearls\\" as a single in Europe in May 1999.

(2011). Literature Circles in EFL: How they stimulate the social interaction. Retrieved September 24, 2011, from Literature Circles in EFL: http://eltdigest.com/literaturecircles  Introduction  English language learners often say that reading, which is a vital element of language learning, is boring and difficult. This problematic situation might be the result of not practicing EFL reading in the right way. So, is there an effective way of using literature in the EFL classroom? The issue, this article intends to investigate is, what language interactions and classroom discourse are taking place in 'Literature Circles' and how this might affect the language development of foreign language learners? The suggested idea is that, as a balanced element of the school curriculum, literature circles can provide an exciting way to promote student engagement in extensive reading by means of cooperative learning and collaborative work and offer the potential to promote reading for enjoyment. The main focus of the analysis has been the student-to-student interactions and classroom discourse taking place during literature circles discussions. The main concern was over how different variables affect the language development of English learners. The results show that, during the process of this research, the students were highly motivated for reading and in that way improved their interactional skills in English. They experienced a different atmosphere of practicing language. They had similar tasks as they had before but this time for a more realistic purpose and in a more authentic environment.  Overview  Nowadays, nearly all EFL coursebooks compete to include the most up-to-date and interesting texts for the target age group, while on the other hand the fiction literature has a treasure of themes which, relate more to our everyday lives. All this goes against what most English language learners and many English teachers as well believe: poems, short stories, and plays do not have a major role in classrooms aimed at developing communicative competence in English, and literary texts are only for advanced learners. In reality, most students often think that the study of English literature is boring and difficult. This problematic situation might be the result of not teaching literature in the right way. Most English learners think that studying literature is definitely not the right way to develop either language skills or interest into literature. Today, most of the foreign language teachers, are in search of specific learning approaches that have strong student centered components like cooperative and collaborative learning. In this article, the term 'literature circles' in the EFL classroom refers to; small groups of students reading the same piece of literature to accomplish different tasks like preparing questions, reporting challenging vocabulary, finding cultural items, determining the well written parts or making connections with the contemporary society. The members of the groups later come together in the classroom to have a discussion under the supervision of their English teacher on the piece of literature they covered. Being greatly influenced by the effect of these literature circles on L1 classes, a research was conducted at a high school in Sofia, Bulgaria to find out more about how teachers can increase the student interaction and adapt literature circles into EFL classes to increase foreign language competence. The main question arising from the problem at this stage was: Is there an effective way to use literature in the EFL classroom? The research also focused on how much the student interaction in an EFL class could be encouraged through literature circles.  Background  The idea of 'Literature Circles in EFL' initially came from the adult 'book clubs' defined as a group of people who meet regularly to discuss the specific book they have read and share their opinions, likes or dislikes about it. Similarly, as DaLieDaLie, S. O. (2001). Students Becoming Real Readers: Literature Circles in High School English Classes. In B. O. Ericson, Teaching reading in high school English classes (pp. 84-100). Urbana: NCTE. explains, a 'literature circle' is a students' equivalent of an adult book club in the L1 English classroom. The aim is to encourage student-choice and a love of reading in young people. According to DaLie, the true intent of Literature Circles is \\"to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers\\" in English as their native language. 'Literature Circles' are small groups of students who gather to discuss a piece of literature in depth. The discussion is guided by students' response to what they have read. Schlick Noe & JohnsonSchlick Noe, K. L., & Johnson, N. J. (1999). Getting Started with Literature Circles. Norwood, MA: Christopher- Gordon Publishers, Inc. further explain that, you may hear talks about events and characters in the book, the author's craft, or personal experiences related to the story. As a key element of the English L1 classes in US, DanielsDaniels, H. (2002). Literature Circles: Voice and Choice in Book Clubs and Reading Groups (2nd Edition ed.). Portland, Maine: Stenhouse explains 'Literature Circles' as a form of independent reading, structured as collaborative small groups, and guided by reader-response principles in light of current comprehension research. On the EFL side of the picture, Furr,Furr, M. (2004). How and Why to Use EFL Literature Circles. Retrieved September 24, 2011, from Welcome to EFL Literature Circles: http://www.eflliteraturecircles.com literature circles in EFL are magic in that they have the power to transform 'Foreign Language Learners' from passive, rather shy, reticent students into students who eagerly point at their texts in order to support their arguments while sharing their opinions in English!  Aims  Based on all the above-mentioned issues related to the difficulty of implementing literature in EFL classes, the initial aim with this research was to find out how literature circles stimulate the social interaction among language learners and promote the collaborative learning in the EFL classroom. Wendy C. KastenKasten, W. (1995). Literature Circles for the Teaching of Literature-Based Reading. In M. Radencich, & L. McKay, Flexible Grouping for Literacy in the Elementary Grades (pp. 66-80). Needham Heights, MA: Allyn and Bacon. believes that literature circles promote peer discussions, negotiation of ideas, and the expression of comprehension, which is a feature that is most common in literature circles. As it is clear that classroom interaction and social learning will appeal to teachers and researchers who have an interest in classroom discourse, this research tends to find out more about the extent and importance of literary discourse in foreign language acquisition and the need and importance of literary texts for a comprehensive attainment of higher levels of language skills. 'Literature Circles in EFL' study can be important on the grounds that, with greater needs on improving foreign language learning and skills development for general language competency and exam preparation, there is a need for a research into the process underlying the performance and literary materials used to stimulate the student interaction in foreign language classes through collaborative work on literature circles. As NunanNunan, D. (1992). Research Methods in Language Learning. New York, NY: CUP. states, this kind of research can provide guidance for teacher education, instructional materials, and curriculum development.  Research  The main issues the research intends to investigate and expects to find out are mainly focused on the responses and findings of the following major research questions: What language interactions and classroom discourse are taking place in literature circles and how might this affect the language development of foreign language learners? The intended research further aims to discover if teaching of literature or literary texts makes language acquisition more 'use-focused' instead of 'form- focused' and if it is beneficial to include literature or literary texts in EFL curriculum at all the stages of language learning in general. The primary research rationale suggests that, as a balanced element of the school curriculum, literature circles can provide an exciting way to promote student engagement in social interaction and improve foreign language learning by means of cooperative learning and collaborative work and offer the potential to promote reading for enjoyment. It is suggested by Schlick Noe & Johnson that 'Literature Circles' are easy to fit into a comprehensive literacy program as a way for students to apply what they are learning about reading and writing.  Methodology  Searching for a suitable research methodology for the project, Lemke'sLemke, J. L. (1985). Using Language in the Classroom. Geelong, Australia: Deaking University Press. statements were found the most helpful, where he embraces a social perspective on language that sees schools not as 'knowledge delivery systems' but as social institutions in which people affect each other's lives. He argues that classroom education is talk. \\"It is the social use of language to enact regular activity structures and to share systems of meaning among teachers and students\\". This research project mainly focuses on literature circles, which Daniels describes as a quite sophisticated and highly evolved part of the wider collaborative learning movement. Before making a distinction between cooperative and collaborative learning, we should know that, the act of learning takes place in social interactions through joint, collaborative activity. As Baquedano- L√≥pezBaquedano-L√≥pez, P. (2004). Literacy Practices across Learning Contexts. In A. Duranti, A Companion to Linguistic Anthropology (pp. 245-269). Malden, MA: Blackwell. states, learning takes place first at the social level which is 'the inter-personal level' and is later appropriated by the individual one which is 'the intra-personal level'. Daniels introduces a distinction between 'cooperative learning', which is mainly used to describe traditional skills- oriented school tasks assigned by teachers to student groups, and 'collaborative learning', which is preferred for more higher-order, student- centered and open-ended activities. To find the relation between literature circles and communicative and cooperative learning, we depart from Raphael and Gavelek'sRaphael, T. E., & Gavelek, J. R. (2001). Book Clubs for Children. In B. E. Cullinan, & D. G. Person, The Continuum encyclopedia of children's literature (pp. 97-99). New York: Continuum International. view that 'literature circles' can be traced to the idea of cooperative learning study groups where students work collaboratively on specific projects or tasks. As it is also mentioned by Ernst-Slavit, Carrison, & Spiesman-Laughlin,Ernst- Slavit, G., Carrison, C., & Spiesman-Laughlin, J. (2009). Creating Opportunities for \\"Grand Conversations\\" Among ELLs With Literature Circles. In J. Coppola, & E. V. Primas, One Classroom, Many Learners: Best Literacy Practices for Today's Multilingual Classrooms (pp. 91 - 118). Newark, DE: International Reading Association. literature circles provide opportunities for oral language and literacy growth for all students, including English language learners. Many teachers, however, are hesitant to use this instructional approach with students who are learning English. On the one hand, it is generally difficult to make a distinction between cooperative and collaborative learning methods at the beginning. When we consider the advantages of small group structure and active student participation in collaborative and cooperative tasks over passive, lecture based teaching, the two terms seem quite close in meaning. In both ways learning is supported by a discovery based approach. Both methods require group skills and come with a framework upon which the group's activity resides, but cooperative learning is usually more structurally defined than collaborative learning. On the other hand, experts define the differences between these methodologies as one of knowledge and power, as RockwoodRockwood, H. S. (1995a). Cooperative and collaborative learning. The national teaching & learning forum, 4 (6), 8-9. explains. It can be concluded that cooperative learning is based on foundational knowledge while collaborative learning is more on the constructionist's view that knowledge is a social construct. Cooperative learning requires the instructor as the center of authority and is usually more closed-ended and usually has specific answers. In comparison, collaborative learning does not entail the instructor's authority and requires small groups which are often given more open-ended, complex tasks. = Participants = The study was conducted on two groups of students at a private high school in Sofia, Bulgaria. The first group consisted of 34 (fourteen-year-old) teenagers in eight-grade and the second group included 33 (eighteen-year-old) young adults in twelfth-grade. The aforementioned high school is an English language profile school, where eight-grade is a preparatory year with 21 hours of English language instruction weekly, starting from elementary level up to the intermediate throughout the year. In the school, starting from the ninth-grade onwards, the language of instruction for math, physics, chemistry and biology is English as well. Twelfth-grade is the graduation year, when students study intensively to get ready for university entrance exams such as, State-Graduation-Exam, TOEFL, IELTS or SAT. Because of these reasons English language is the most crucial subject for those age groups. The school has a multicultural setting as there are many students from different nationalities and family backgrounds. The class sizes are rather small with an average of 15 students per class. = Data collection = The research was planned to explain how to increase student interaction which leads to better learning of foreign languages and the way language can be integrated into the activity routines of the classroom. So the data which is necessary for the research was planned to be collected by methods of analyzing classroom interaction which involves the analysis of classroom talk during the literature circles. To achieve this, a classroom observation form for the teacher was chosen which complies with Bales' Interaction Process Analysis System (IPA).Bales, R. (1999). Social Interaction Systems: Theory and Measurement. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers. Later, the data collected was interpreted according to (IPA) system and was exposed to conceptual theoretical work which led to further relevant data collection or writing conclusions for the research. About the choice of data collection during classroom observations, Nunan states that, although formal experiments are widely used to collect evidence on language learning and use, they are comparatively rare in genuine classrooms which have been constituted for teaching purposes, not for the purpose of data collection. On the other hand, as EllisEllis, R. (1990). Instructed Second Language Acquisition. Malden: Blackwell. describes the empirical research of L2 classrooms, he mentions that an ethnographic study of interaction would be suitable for the classroom interaction and L2 acquisition whose goal is to test a number of hypotheses relating to how interacting in the classroom contributes to L2 acquisition and to explore which types of interaction best facilitate acquisition. Considering all this, to decide on a method for the research, a flexible qualitative method which allows greater adaptation of the interaction between the teacher and the students seemed to be the best method for class observation among such a small participant group. In this way the teacher would be able to ask more open-ended questions when necessary and the participants would be free to respond in their own words instead of just saying simply 'yes' or 'no'. The source for the data was primarily collected via semi structured methods such as the video recordings of the literature circles, stimulated-recall sessions followed by interviews and questionnaires filled in by students and teachers notes on the discussions conducted in class. The two main variables being observed will be classroom activities like; activity type, participant organization, content, student modality and materials and classroom language like; use of target language, information gap, sustained speech, reaction to code or message, incorporation of preceding utterance, discourse initiation and relative restriction of linguistic form mentioned as the communicative orientation of language teaching by Nunan. In addition, because of the less formal relation between the researcher and participants, they responded more elaborately and in greater detail. The researcher also had the opportunity to respond immediately to what participants said by tailoring subsequent questions with the information the participant had provided. Related to this, it is believed that by conducting a qualitative research, some new ideas and a hypothesis may be generated for a later quantitative research. = Data analysis = The main focus of the analysis was the continuous observation of communication patterns in literature circles. The main concern was over how these variables affected the language development of foreign language learners. For the analysis of the collected data, Bales' Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) system was used especially to identify and record the nature of each separate act in ongoing group interaction. IPA is devised by Bales for the continuous observation of communication patterns in interactive groups. It is mainly based on the assumption that group success depends on both how well the group can solve its tasks (task function) and how satisfied it can keep its members (socio-emotional function). Bales identified 12 interactional \\"moves\\" in four categories: (1) socio-emotional positive (shows solidarity, tension reduction, agreement); (2) socio-emotional negative (shows antagonism, tension, disagreement); (3) task-related attempted solutions (gives suggestions, opinions, orientation); and (4) task-related questions (asks for suggestions, opinions, orientation). At least one rater observes each group member, and scores occurrences of each interactional \\"move.\\" This method has been used in a variety of settings, and is a reliable and useful way to analyze group interactions according to Antony S.R. Manstead.Antony S.R. Manstead, e. a. (Ed.). (1995). The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social Psychology. Oxford: Blackwell. After analyzing the classroom interaction during the reading circles according to Bales' IPA system and gathering the information from the interviews and questionnaires, it is clearly seen that literature circles stimulate the student interaction in terms of Bales' criteria in a dramatic way. This probably must have been the reason why Furr calls 'magic' to define literature circles. = Limitations = Some of the drawbacks that the research suffered from can be summarized as the limited number of students to be accessed. To provide enough detailed evidence for such a study, the number of participants was kept reasonably small. The reason for such a low number has been the fact that the participants were mainly chosen to provide an authentic classroom atmosphere to be observed and evaluated in relation to the determined criteria. The main variables observed can be listed under the 'classroom activities' and 'classroom language' headings which are explained in the methodology chapter in detail. Another drawback has been the limited control over the instructional process and observing the learning outcomes in relation to the broadness of the issue. As the study intends to observe the student interaction in a foreign language learning environment, teacher involvement has been kept at minimum not to interfere with the authentic atmosphere of student interaction during the discussions. The meticulous observation process has also been quite difficult taking all the related criteria into consideration. But still, considering all these drawbacks, we can say that the results reached with this study open a way for a future quantitative research over literature circles in EFL.  Findings  When the first half of the school year was over, a survey was conducted which consisted of four sections. The criterion for the choice of the questionnaires was Bales' Interaction Process Analysis system. For this purpose the \\"Literature Circles in Action - Lesson Plans\\" questionnairesErlendson, M., & Antifaiff, G. (2004, March 11). Literature Circles in Action - Lesson Plans. Retrieved January 20, 2011, from Journey Through Literature: were found the most appropriate. The four sections of the survey each focus on a different area of the study. These include questionnaires related to: self-assessment of the participants; assessment of discussion groups; evaluation of the literature circles; and an evaluation guide for the discussion group with two open-ended questions. While evaluating the results, the averages were calculated over 40 participants' responses. The first questionnaire was the \\"Self assessment of the Participants in Discussion Groups\\" which included ten statements. The participants preferred one of the three choices (very good, satisfactory, needs improving) to assess their performances in their discussions. The statements given are as follows: # I shared my ideas and offered my suggestions # I spoke clearly and slowly enough # I answered others questions # I remained on topic and helped the group stay focused # I encouraged others to participate # I disagreed without hurting others feelings # I summarized or repeated my ideas when necessary # I gave reasons for opinions # I listened courteously and effectively # I tried to understand and extend the suggestions of others The results of this questionnaire gave us an overview of the self-confidence level of the participants in discussion groups. It is apparent from these results that participants feel quite self-confident especially about answering others' questions, disagreeing kindly and listening courteously and effectively. They also feel safe about keeping focused on topic, summarizing their ideas when necessary, and extending the suggestions of others. But on the other hand, it is also significant that they need to improve their skills of encouraging others to participate, giving reasons for their opinions, offering their suggestion and speaking clearly enough. The second questionnaire was about the \\"Assessment of the Discussion Groups\\" which included five statements. The participants were asked to share their opinions (yes, no, sometimes) on these statements to assess the specific discussion group environment. The statements are as follows: # Everyone participates and shares in the discussion process. Communication is interactive. # The group is supportive of its individual members. Group climate promotes friendliness. # Group members often ask questions for clarification or elaboration. # The group discussion stays on topic, or on directly related issues. # The group is energetic and enthusiastic. The results of this questionnaire gave an understanding of the effectiveness of literature circles as discussion groups. Data from this questionnaire reveals that participants believe that the group members often ask questions for clarification and the group discussion stays on topic. There is also a shared idea that the members should participate more and that they should be supportive of each other by encouraging their friends in need. What is interesting about these results is that nearly one fourth of the participants believe that the groups are not energetic and enthusiastic. The third questionnaire was the \\"Literature Circles Evaluation\\" which gives a specific insight of the general values in literature circles. The participants chose one of the three responses (need to improve, do it, do it well) to assess the specific characteristics of the literature circles. The statements are as follows: # preparation work done in notebook # literature book at school, not at home # reading completed # ask questions to others # offer my own ideas # encourage and respect others' opinions # make eye contact with others # keep my voice at arm's length (not to disturb other participants) The results of the third questionnaire make the participant's performance qualities clear in literature circles. From this data it is apparent that most participants are careful about the literature circle materials like the books or the journals. We also see here that, nearly all participants read their parts completely and keep eye contact with others during the discussions. In contrast, it is clear that there is an urgent need to improve students' question asking skills. Similarly the participants do not feel at ease encouraging and respecting their group members' ideas and they also agree that they should lower their voices. The fourth questionnaire was the \\"Discussion Group Evaluation Form\\" which has two major open-ended writing tasks to find out what skills do participants believe that they are good at and most importantly, what skills do they think that are most crucial for literature circle discussions. The two open-ended writing tasks included are as follows: # My overall rating of myself is as follows: # I think the person who worked the hardest in my group is ... because: The results of this questionnaire shows us firstly, the areas or skills that students feel most confident about and secondly what skills do they most value during the literature circle discussions.  Conclusion  This study has researched a new method of using literature in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to stimulate the social interaction among language learners. A bottom up approach based on the observation of the classroom interaction and the conducting of a questionnaire survey has been presented, combining qualitative observation results with statistical information from the survey. The methods of using literature circles to practice foreign language show encouraging results for both teenagers and young adults and are efficient compared to other conventional techniques in EFL classrooms. The main rationale for this research was to find out the benefits of using literature circles in English as a foreign language learning environments. The study has set out to determine the effects of these student reading groups on language learning as most of the foreign language learners find extensive reading boring and those classes are the most challenging ones for the teachers as well. One of the significant findings to emerge from this study was, if the literature circles help language learning through stimulation of the classroom atmosphere by having the teachers and students focus on the interaction patterns during the book discussion sessions. The suggested ideas with this research was that, the literature circles as a balanced element of the school curriculum can provide an exciting way to promote student engagement in extensive reading by means of cooperative learning and collaborative work and offer the potential to promote reading for enjoyment. The main focus of the analysis part was the contrast in interactions and classroom discourse taking place in literature circles and regular alternative extensive reading classes. The main concern was concentrated on how these variables affect the language development of English learners. The main variables observed were 'classroom activities' like, activity type, participant organization, content, student modality and materials and 'classroom language' like, the use of target language, information gaps, sustained speech, reaction to code or message, incorporation of preceding utterances, discourse initiation and relative restrictions of linguistic forms. The results of the study presented in the findings chapter clearly show that the development of the classroom interaction assists language learning and literature circles is an effective way of bringing the classroom interaction to life. If we take the reflections of the student and the results of the observations into consideration, it is evident that the implication of literature circles is a rather different procedure compared to ordinary classroom instruction. Literature circles bring excitement and energy into the language classroom. During this study the participants enjoyed the sense of responsibility for their own learning and decided to improve their interaction skills to become better English language learners. As for the benefits in EFL classes, it is also observed that literature circles facilitate learning by giving students an opportunity to share opinions in a specially designed classroom atmosphere, practicing situations very similar to real life experiences. I believe that the effectiveness of this method is greatly dependent on the teacher's motivation. If the teacher manages to produce a collaborative learning environment with the suitable materials, I believe that the students will be readily eager to participate and support the shared experience and knowledge created in the classroom. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the students were motivated to reading and by this means improved their foreign language skills during the process of this research. They experienced a different atmosphere of practicing language. They did similar assignments as they did before but this time for a more realistic purpose and in a more authentic environment. The implications of this research for the EFL teachers would be appalling as the study promotes after class extensive reading and development of discussion skills through the encouragement of interaction patterns which many teachers are after. The limitations encountered during the study were the small number of participants in a real school environment which is not appropriate for an experimental quantitative study. That is why a qualitative study was preferred to build on observations and questionnaires. But the results derived from the classroom observations and participant questionnaires provide enough background for a further study. Other disadvantages were the high number of variables to be observed and again limited control over the instructional process and observing the learning outcomes in relation to the broadness of the issue. Although this study is based on the classroom interaction as the criteria to be observed in literature circles, future studies may focus on some other variables like the development of reading and writing skills, or even grammar and vocabulary improvement through literature circles. Moreover, by using some other research methods, the results of this study may be compared with the findings of those other studies which will use different research methods. It would increase the validity and reliability issues in the findings. In addition to these points, the research could further explore the development of materials and procedures appropriate for different purposes or levels of competency in foreign languages. This study has gathered supporting ideas related to the similar research projects. This impact will provide the language teachers to be interested in the subject more and try similar applications which will provide further evidence for future studies. As a result, it is clear that the teachers and learners have problems regarding the usage of literary texts in EFL classes and the solution requires a new point of view on the teaching of literature both by teachers and by textbooks. The results of such a study can motivate the teachers to use the literature resources more effectively encouraging real life interaction in the classroom. For instance, in accordance with the findings of the study, it can be suggested that teaching with the help of reading texts should not be limited to only fiction literature. As well as the novels and short stories, some other texts like fact files should also be adapted for the discussion groups. Originating from the results of this study further research can be done by collecting more quantitative data on the subject. Maybe, some experimental quantitative research designs would be suitable for this purpose. As teachers and educators, there are many questions waiting to be dealt with in front of us like, \\"Are there more opportunities we can provide our students with for a better learning environment?\\" or \\"What are the contemporary modals of professional teacher development?\\" I strongly believe that this study has put another brick on the literature circle studies in the field, contributing to the growth of this collaborative work.

Cannabis Corpse formed in Richmond, Virginia in 2006 under the Forcefield label. Since then, Cannabis Corpse has released five LPs and one EP. The band features members of Municipal Waste and Antietam 1862. Their name originates as a parody of the name of veteran death metal band Cannibal Corpse. While the Cannabis Corpse songs are fully original, their album and song titles are parodies of many other death metal bands' album and song titles (e.g. \\"Tube of the Resinated\\" vs Cannibal Corpse's \\"Tomb of the Mutilated\\"). History In 1999, bassist/guitarist Philip \\"Landphil\\" Hall coined the \\"Cannabis Corpse\\" name with his brother Josh \\"HallHammer\\" Hall. The original line up had Landphil on vocals and a recruit named John Gonzalez (of Nehema) on guitar.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1949 by the architect Arne S√∏rvig. The church seats about 400 people. History For a long time, the church on the island of J√∏a was located at Fosnes (along the Fosnav√•gen bay), where the Fosnes Chapel is now located. That church was at Fosnes from 1250 until 1896 when that church burned down. After that, there was much debate about where the church should be rebuilt. It was determined that the new parish church should be built in the village of Dun, in the middle of the island of J√∏a since that was more centrally located for the population. The first church built in the village of Dun was consecrated in 1900. It was shortlived, however, because on 10 July 1944 a lightning strike hit the church and it burned down.

These programs primarily served secondary school students, but also served adults returning for further education and training. In 1931 and 1952, vocational buildings were added onto the south side of Wichita High School East, and along adjacent Grove Street, to provide training in vocational and industrial arts. Between 1952 and 1968, about 600 students enrolled each year in various vocational courses there. In the summer of 1968, the District chose this site to open its Wichita Area Vocational-Technical School (WAVTS) \\"Vocational Technical Center\\" (by 1996, officially, the \\"Grove Campus\\" of the Wichita Area Technical College). This facility, under a separate administration, offered training in 18 different areas of trade and industry, to both students and adults.Davis, Nina (1978), updated 1996 by Sara Lomax, \\"School Histories,\\" Excerpts from A History of Wichita Public Schools Buildings, Wichita Public Schools / USD 259, retrieved April 30, 2017. In 1953, bowing to decades of pressure from West Wichitans, the District built the first high school in West Wichita - Wichita High School West, which, at its inception was primarily a vocational-technical school (initially, only 22% of West High graduates went on to college). Consequently, the West High curriculum initially emphasized vocational preparation, rather than academics. A large homemaking department taught students family budgeting, food preparation, child care and family relations. The school's business education department taught secretarial training, stenography, retail selling and business. An industrial education department taught woodworking, metalworking, auto mechanics, electrical work, printing, mechanical drawing and other trades. However, the school eventually became a regular academic high school, which it is today.

By 1973, the Wichita Area Vocational Technical School had become the largest public school in Wichita, with over 5,000 people enrolling in its classes each year. WAVTS had expanded its vocational training from rudimentary crafts, to include advanced industrial skills such as estimating, procurement, production line setup and production scheduling. Concurrently, traditional home economics courses were still being taught at secondary schools throughout the system, but had been expanded to provide professional food service skills.

Originally built to carry the Taff Vale Extension of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NA&HR;) across the Rhymney River, it is now part of National Cycle Route 47 Background During the Industrial Revolution, and the mass- extraction of coal from South Wales, there was a resultant growth in construction of railways into the South Wales Coalfield. The Taff Vale Railway so monopolised the trade of shipping coal to Cardiff Docks, that mine owners were desperate for competitor railway companies to both improve speeds of shipping, provide access to new markets, and hence reduce shipping rates. The London and North Western Railway had developed a route for the industrialised West Midlands and Northwest England, by controlling the Llanfihangel Railway and the Grosmont Railway's as feeder lines into the Hereford Railway, and hence onwards via the joint GWR/LNWR controlled Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. This allowed shipment of goods from Pontypool and the Ebbw Valley to Hereford. However, access to the productive Rhymney Valley and Rhondda Valley coalfields was at best restricted, through having to route trains south to Cardiff along the TVR, then along the South Wales Railway to Newport via the GWR, before being able to access LNWR controlled track. The UK Parliament hence approved an Act of Parliament on 3 August 1846, the construction of the Taff Vale Extension, which would connect Coedygric North Junction at Pontypool with the TVR/GWR at Quakers Yard, and hence allow direct and LNWR controlled access. The LNWR approved the required capital expenditure, and merged the existing three railways and the extension project in the new Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. Construction The route for the Taff Vale Extension required the construction of two significant viaducts across two major river valleys: one across the Ebbw River (the Crumlin Viaduct), and one further west across the Rhymney River, the Hengoed Viaduct. This would be the last major project for the NA&HR; to complete the Taff Vale Extension before the line was opened in 1858. Charles Liddell, the chief engineer of the NA&HR;, decided that while a stone bridge would be impractical at Crumlin due to the narrow valley sides and hence high winds, at Maesycwmmer all of the natural resources existed to build an effective stone viaduct. Having won the contract to design and provide the structure of the wrought iron bridge at Crumlin, it was natural for the Scottish civil engineer Thomas W. Kennard to win the design of the Hengoed Viaduct. Apart from spanning the Rhymney river, the viaduct also had to span the Brecon and Merthyr Railway's station on the south side, and curve slightly across the valley to initially form a junction with the B&MR; on its northern side, before entering the Bryn Tunnel (). With a stipulated completion date of 1 October 1854, Liddell engaged contractors Messrs Rennie and Logan, who began work on the masonry structure in mid-1853. Maesycwmmer was a quiet rural farming valley before 1846, but the first project of Messrs Rennie and Logan was to construct both a quarry, from which to extract stone to build the viaduct, and also a complete housing and social complex to house the workers and their families. The houses remain along the present main road, while the now-disused quarry lies in a field behind the houses of St Anne's Gardens. Liddell's design consisted of 16 arches, with the first effectively a separate bridge skewed across the low level B&MR;, to allow for crossing their Hengoed railway station. With a maximum height above the valley bottom of and a full length of , construction came at a cost of ¬£20,000 (equivalent to ¬£1,430,400 in 2003), with one fatal accident. Operations The line opened as a double track as agreed in 1858. Integrated as part of the Great Western Railway during the railway grouping in 1921, in 1928 the entire length of the Taff Vale Extension was downscaled to a single track. Through passenger and goods traffic ceased over the viaduct on 15 June 1964, and the line was completely closed and the track lifted later that year as part of the Beeching Axe. After the closure, Hengoed viaduct was offered for sale at a nominal sum of ¬£1. Today Inaccessible to the public for over 35 years, it was agreed for the viaduct to become part of the National Cycle Network. Integrated as part of the Celtic Trail within National Cycle Route 47, which provides a (mostly) traffic free cycle route from Quakers Yard to Newport, its ownership was transferred from British Rail to Railway Paths Ltd in 1999. Hengoed Viaduct was opened for public access in 2000. In April 2004, the Heritage Lottery Fund gave Caerphilly borough council a grant of ¬£870,000. This allowed a programme of refurbishment to take place, including repairing and repointing to the pier bases, parapets and arches; as well as repairs to the remains of Hengoed ‚ÄòHigh Level‚Äô Station at the western end of the viaduct. Works have improved public access and safety, with new fencing, viewing platforms and the installation of lighting. Finally, the site and route was added to by the addition of \\"Wheel o Drams\\" (locally known as \\"The Stargate\\") sculpture by Andy Hazell, an unusual piece of modern art formed from a circle of coalmining dram trucks to commemorate the industrial heritage of this locality within the history of the South Wales Valleys.

One of the large family of Austronesian languages, it is spoken by the Sakizaya people, who are concentrated on the eastern Pacific coast of Taiwan. Since 2007 they have been recognized by the Taiwan government as one of the sixteen distinct indigenous groups on the island.  History  After the Takobowan Incident of 1876, the Sakizaya people hid among the Nataoran Amis. Scholars mistakenly categorized the Sakizaya language as a dialect of Amis. In 2002, the Center of Aboriginal Studies of National Chengchi University in Taiwan corrected this error when they edited the indigenous languages textbooks. That year Sakizaya language was designated both as a Chilai and Amis sublanguage.

The song was originally written by Britney Spears; after she started working on her sixth studio album Circus (2008), Spears contacted Nicole Morier to write songs with her. Together, they wrote several songs. \\"Whiplash\\", which was produced by co- writer Greg Kurstin, failed to make the album. In 2011, Selena Gomez recorded the song with her band for When the Sun Goes Down. \\"Whiplash\\" is a dance song with influences of electro, relying heavily on the usage of synthesizers. The pre-chorus has a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers the lyrics in a thick British accent. \\"Whiplash\\" is musically different and much more aggressive than the rest of the album, and its lyrics speak of a blossoming romance; it has been compared to the work of Spears. \\"Whiplash\\" received mixed to positive reviews. While some critics called it one of the standout tracks of When the Sun Goes Down, others dismissed its rap sections and lyrics. Selena Gomez & the Scene performed the song on their We Own the Night Tour (2011). Background \\"Whiplash\\" was written and produced by Greg Kurstin, with additional writing by Nicole Morier and Britney Spears. The latter had recorded \\"Heaven on Earth\\", written by Morier and songwriting team Freescha, for her fifth studio album Blackout (2007). During an interview with On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Spears named the song her favorite from the album. When she started recording her sixth studio album Circus (2008), she contacted Morier to write songs with her. When the two were in the studio, they asked Kurstin to give them tracks. Among the songs they worked on were \\"Mmm Papi\\", \\"Rock Me In\\" and \\"Whiplash\\". Both wanted to do something that Spears had not done before. \\"Mmm Papi\\" and \\"Rock Me In\\" were included in Circus; however, \\"Whiplash\\" failed to make the cut. Morier explained, \\"There‚Äôs a couple songs we started that were great ideas but just incomplete. Maybe we‚Äôll hear them with fresh ears someday and put them out, but I usually just like to start anew.\\" On April 11, 2011, it was reported by MTV News that \\"Whiplash\\" would be recorded by Selena Gomez & the Scene for their third studio album When the Sun Goes Down. Lead singer Selena Gomez is a Spears fan, and after Kurstin played her the track for the first time, she \\"fell in love with it\\", unaware of Spears's contribution to the song. Gomez explained, \\"I came and sang and saw that she had co-written it, so I was very excited. [...] It was an honor and I'm completely stoked.\\" The song leaked online in early June 2011, several weeks prior to the album's release. Composition \\"Whiplash\\" is a dance song with influences of electro. It features a heavy usage of synthesizers, which were compared to those in Christina Aguilera's \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" (2010). During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent, before the pulsating chorus begins. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the key of D minor. The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B4. It is also musically different and a departure from other songs in When the Sun Goes Down which are more straightforward pop, such as \\"Who Says\\" and \\"Bang Bang Bang\\". Several critics compared the song to the works of Spears. James Dinh of MTV News said that \\"Gomez, who has gushed to us about her Spears fandom, shows off her best impersonation\\" in the song. While reviewing the We Own the Night Tour, Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the song \\"sound[s] as if it was ripped directly from Spears' catalog.\\" Blair Kelly of musicOMH compared it to the music of Circus, and more specifically to \\"Womanizer\\" (2008). It was also compared by Tim Sendra of AllMusic to the \\"electro glam\\" sound of Goldfrapp. The lyrics of \\"Whiplash\\" speak of a blossoming romance. Gomez sings in the chorus, \\"Come on and take me to the other side / I'm blown away, when I look into your eyes /I'm so in love, I think I'm going to crash / And get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash.\\" Critical reception \\"Whiplash\\" has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of AllMusic selected it as one of the 'track picks' of When the Sun Goes Down, calling it a \\"stomping jam\\" and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song \\"adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record.\\" In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that \\"Whiplash\\" was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying \\"what I can't figure out is why in the world would [Spears] give up this hot track\\". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that \\"the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt ‚Äî see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears.\\" Blair Kelly of musicOMH was divided in his review of \\"Whiplash\\", calling it one of the best uptempo tracks from the album, although dismissing its \\"horrendous rap sections\\", elaborating that \\"Selena Gomez should never be allowed to rap again, especially if she‚Äôs going to break into a horrific Queen's English accent midway through.\\" Some reviews of the song were negative, with Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stating that Gomez \\"brings nothing in the way of personality to her songs\\", adding that \\"the swaggering 'sex' song 'Whiplash' would be comical if it wasn't so tedious.\\" In another broadly negative review, PopMatters writer John Bergstrom suggested that Spears did not write any songs on Femme Fatale \\"to avoid the embarrassment of overwrought, fake-British-accent-flaunting would-be come-ons like 'Whiplash'. Live performances Selena Gomez & the Scene performed \\"Whiplash\\" on shows at the We Own the Night Tour (2011). The band performed the song after a medley of Britney Spears covers, including versions of \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Till the World Ends\\", and \\"I Wanna Go\\". After \\"Whiplash\\", the band continued with a performance of Gomez's \\"Tell Me Something I Don't Know\\" (2008).

Minnesota had eight seats in the House, apportioned according to the 1990 United States Census. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected served in the 107th Congress from January 3, 2001 until January 3, 2003. The election coincided with the 2000 presidential election and the 2000 U.S. Senate election. Except for DFLer David Minge of the 2nd congressional district, all other House incumbents from Minnesota who stood for reelection were reelected. Minge's seat came under the control of the Republican Party of Minnesota as a result of the 2000 election. DFL incumbent Bruce Vento of the 4th congressional district died in office less than a month prior to the election; however, he was not seeking reelection, and the DFL nominee running for election to replace him, Betty McCollum, was able to keep the seat in the DFL's hands.

Thus, Luther was forced to run in the new congressional district 2 in the 2002 election, while Kennedy ran in the new congressional district 6. Luther, who was first elected to Congress in 1994, was unchallenged in the DFL primary. However, in the general election race against Republican challenger John Kline, the more conservative composition of the new district worked against Luther. Luther's campaign was further harmed by political fallout that was created when Samuel Garst, a Luther campaign staffer, entered the race on the \\"No New Taxes\\" line in an attempt to use a false flag to split the conservative vote. In the end, Garst was only able to secure 4.33 percent of the vote, and the political damage to Luther contributed to Kline winning the election by a margin of more than 11 percent. =DFL primary= Candidates * Bill Luther, incumbent U.S. Representative since 1995 Results =Republican primary= Candidates * John Kline, retired Colonel (USMC) Results =General election= Results District 3 thumb Incumbent Republican Jim Ramstad, who was first elected in 1990, defeated DFL challenger Darryl Stanton, and won election to his seventh term in Congress, by a landslide 44.14 percent margin. =DFL primary= Candidates * Darryl Stanton Results =Republican primary= Candidates * Jim Ramstad, incumbent U.S. Representative since 1991 Results =General election= Results District 4 thumb Incumbent DFLer Betty McCollum, who was first elected in 2000, faced off against Clyde Billington of the Republican Party of Minnesota and Scott J.

The white, wooden chapel was built in a long church style in 1926. The church seats about 45 people. The church is not regularly used for services, but it is used for funerals at the adjacent cemetery. There is an annual worship service held at the chapel once each summer at Olsok. History For a long time, the church on the island of J√∏a was located at Fosnes (along the Fosnav√•gen bay), where the Fosnes Chapel is now located. That church was at Fosnes from 1250 until 1896 when that church burned down. After that, there was much debate about where the church should be rebuilt. It was determined that the new parish church should be built in the village of Dun, in the middle of the island of J√∏a since that was more centrally located for the population. After the new church was completed in 1900, there was another question about what to do with the cemetery at the old church site. In 1926, the present little chapel was built at the site of the old Fosnes church, next to the Fosnes Church cemetery which is still in use.

The existence of rhinoceroses in ancient China is attested both by archaeological evidence and by references in ancient Chinese literature. Depictions of rhinoceroses in ancient Chinese art are typically very accurate and lifelike, suggesting that they were modelled first-hand by the artist on living rhinoceroses rather than being based on legend or traveller's tales. The main species of rhinoceros that lived in China in ancient times has been identified as the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), more especially the Northern Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis) although the Indian Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) were also present. Nomenclature There are two ancient Chinese characters that have been interpreted as meaning 'rhinoceros': xƒ´ ÁäÄ; and s√¨ ÂÖï (the former character is used in the modern Chinese word for 'rhinoceros', xƒ´ni√∫ ÁäÄÁâõ). In the early 2nd century dictionary, Shuowen Jiezi, the xƒ´ is defined as \\"an ox occurring beyond the southern frontier. It has a horn on its nose and another one on the crown of its head; it resembles a pig\\"; and the s√¨ is defined as being \\"like a wild ox and dark-colored\\". In the Erya glossary, probably compiled during the 3rd century BC, the xƒ´ is said to resemble a boar, whereas the s√¨ is said to resemble an ox, but the commentary by Guo Pu (276‚Äì324) elaborates, stating that the xƒ´ is like a water buffalo, but with a large paunch, short legs, three toes on each foot, and three horns on a pig-like head, two on its forehead and one on its nose; and the s√¨ has a single horn. It is evident from these two sources that the xƒ´ refers to the two-horned Sumatran Rhinoceros, but it is not clear what exactly the s√¨ refers to. Some authorities suppose that the s√¨ refers to the one-horned Javan Rhinoceros, and some follow the definition given in the Ming Dynasty materia medica, Bencao Gangmu, that the s√¨ is the name for a female rhinoceros. On the other hand, many scholars believe that the s√¨ refers to a type of wild buffalo, or even that the si may have been used as a name for both the more common buffalo and the rarer rhinoceros. Species and distribution Warring States period bronze belt hook in the form of a two-horned rhinoceros, from the State of Ba (modern Sichuan). In prehistoric times, China was home to the gigantic one-horned Elasmotherium, which survived until the late Pleistocene, becoming extinct as late as about 20,000 years ago. It has been speculated that the Chinese \\"unicorn\\", known as the qilin or zhi is a cultural memory of the Elasmotherium. A wooden sculpture of a charging bull-like creature with a huge single horn, similar to modern reconstructions of the Elasmotherium, was discovered in a late Western Han (206 BC ‚Äì AD 9) tomb at Wuwei, Gansu in 1959. All three Asian rhinoceros once lived in China. Most depictions of rhinoceroses in Shang, Zhou and Han art show two distinct horns, and in some cases wrinkles around the eyes are also evident, which are features only found in the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Indian and Javan rhinoceroses only having a single horn). However, a few examples of sculptures showing one-horned rhinoceroses are also known, for example on a bronze cylinder supported by three rhinoceroses from the tomb of King Cuo of Zhongshan (late 4th century BC). Some historians have taken this as evidence that, in addition to the Sumatran Rhinoceros and Northern Sumatran rhinoceros which were more widely distributed within China, the one-horned Javan Rhinoceros was also present in ancient China. On the other hand, the posterior horn of the Sumatran Rhinoceros is often undeveloped and inconspicuous, so it is still possible that such examples of one-horned rhinoceroses may in fact also represent the Sumatran Rhinoceros. During the Shang dynasty the range of the rhinoceros may have reached as far north in Inner Mongolia as the territory of the Shang kings, in the Yellow River valley, but over time its range was reduced, and by the Han Dynasty it was no longer present in northern China, north of the Yangtze River and in Zhongyuan. It was thought the colder climate of northeast Asia caused habitat loss for the rhinoceroses. By the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) it was only found in an area south of the Yangtze River, such as in the modern southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), it was revealed that the demand for rhino horn caused the extinction of rhinoceros in central to northern China. One of the last outposts of the native Chinese rhinoceros was Sichuan, where rhinoceroses were reported to be living up to the late 17th century. The last native population of rhinoceros only became extinct in Yunnan province in the 20th century, although a small population of Southern white rhinoceroses (native to South Africa) were introduced in 2003. Rhinoceros hunting Several Shang Dynasty oracle bone inscriptions record the hunting of the s√¨, including one famous inscription that tells how an accident befell King Wu Ding's hunting party whilst in pursuit of a s√¨: > On the day Jiawu the king went to hunt a rhinoceros. The carriage of > courtier Chu broke its axis. A gelding tripped over stones and bolted away > from the king's carriage. Prince Yang also fell down. The Book of Songs, dating to the Western Zhou (c. 1046‚Äì771 BC), also describes the hunting of the s√¨: > We have bent our bows; > We have our arrows on the string. > Here is a small boar transifixed; > There is a large rhinoceros killed. > The spoil will be presented to the visitors and guests, > Along with the cup of sweet wine. ‚Äî Book of Songs no.180, trans. James > Legge (1814‚Äì1897) However, as discussed above, some scholars now believe that the s√¨ was a wild buffalo rather than a rhinoceros. The character for the xƒ´, which is universally agreed to refer to the rhinoceros, does not occur in oracle bone inscriptions, so there is no certain literary evidence that rhinoceroses were hunted during the Shang Dynasty. Nevertheless, there is some archaeological evidence, in the form of a tarsal bone and a carpal bone from a rhinoceros, that rhinoceroses were present in the region of the Shang capital Yin, and most historians accept that rhinoceroses probably were hunted during the Shang Dynasty. The earliest literary mention of hunting the xƒ´ rhinoceros occurs in the \\"Great Capture\\" chapter of the Lost Book of Zhou (Yizhoushu ÈÄ∏Âë®Êõ∏), where the results of a hunting trip on an enormous scale by the first king of the Zhou Dynasty, King Wu, are recounted: > King Wu hunted and netted 22 tigers, 2 panthers, 5,235 stags, 12 rhinoceri, > 721 yaks, 151 bears, 118 yellow-bears, 353 boars, 18 badgers, 16 king-stags, > 50 musk-deer, 30 tailed-deer, and 3,508 deer. In the Manshu (Tang dynasty) it states that rhinoceroses were hunted by the Nanzhao (in modern Yunnan) using pit traps, and that it was believed that killing one would always bring a thunderstorm. Rhinoceroses in captivity One of the earliest evidences for a captive rhinoceros in China comes from the tomb of Empress Dowager Bo (died 155 BC), a concubine of the first emperor of the Han Dynasty, where a complete rhinoceros skeleton was unearthed. It is thought that this was a specimen from the royal zoo. The Analects has this interesting saying which indicates rhinos were held captive even during the period of Confucius (500 B.C.E): \\"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?\\" (\\"Analects 16:7). During the Tang Dynasty a number of rhinoceroses were presented to the imperial court from south-east Asian countries, including Champa, Chinrap, and Kalinga, as well as Tibet and a country named as Persia. At least some of these rhinoceroses were specimens of the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). Performing elephants and rhinoceroses took part in the entertainments for Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (reigned 712‚Äì756). Rhinoceroses in early Chinese art Rhinoceros-shaped wine vessel dating to the late Shang Dynasty. The earliest, and one of the most impressive, examples of a rhinoceros in Chinese art is a bronze zun wine vessel unearthed in Shandong in 1843, and formerly in the collection of Avery Brundage, which is thought to date to the reign of the last king of Shang, during the first half of the 11th century BC. The vessel is in the form of a two-horned rhinoceros with a rotund body and splayed legs. Another bronze rhinoceros wine vessel, dating to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì AD 9), was discovered in Shaanxi in 1963 (shown at the top of this page). This one is even more lifelike and realistic than the Shang Dynasty example, and must have been modelled on an actual rhinoceros. It is also a more highly decorated piece of art, with complex cloud patterns inlaid into its skin with gold and silver wire. Laurence Sickman has noted that \\"[i]n its bony head, powerful shoulders, ponderous hindquarters, thick folds of skin, firmly planted hoofs, and stance with head lifted on the alert, the essential reality of a rhinoceros is present in a bronze of superlative quality\\". This rhinoceros has two horns and shows distinctive wrinkles around the eyes which are characteristic features of the Sumatran Rhinoceros. The lid of the vessel is in the form of a saddle, and straps attaching the saddle to the rhinoceros go around the belly of the animal, suggesting that the model for this vessel must have been a tame rhinoceros. Rhinoceros hide armour Drawing of rhinoceros hide and buffalo hide armour. During the Zhou Dynasty (1045‚Äì256 BC) rhinoceros hide was used for armour. The Rites of Zhou specifies: > The rhinoceros-hide armour was of seven folds or links, one over another; > the wild-buffalo's-hide armour was of six folds or links; and the armour, > made of two hides together was of five folds or links. The rhinoceros-hide > armour would endure 100 years; the wild-buffalo-hide armour 200 years; and > the armour of double hide 300 years. During the Warring States period, the southern State of Chu was renowned for its rhinoceros hide armour, and the philosopher Xun Zi from the northern State of Qi, who was an official in Chu for a short time, notes that \\"[t]he soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide as hard as metal or stone, and with pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or a scorpion\\". Rhinoceros and buffalo hide was also recorded to have been used for the inner coffin of the emperor, as it was supposed to preserve the body, similar in function to Han Dynasty jade burial suits. In the Manshu (Tang dynasty) it states that rhino and buffalo hide was used for saddles, armor and weapons of Nanzhao troops in Yunnan. Rhinoceros horn Mausoleum of the King of Nanyue. From an early date, rhinoceros horn was believed to have special properties, in particular that it would react by fizzing if it came into contact with poison, and so cups made out of rhinoceros horn were valued as a protection against poisoning. It is thought that rhinoceros horn cups developed during the Warring States Period or earlier, and rhinoceros cups (Chinese s√¨g≈çng ÂÖïËß•) feature prominently in pre-Han literature; they are, for example, mentioned in four of the 300 odes of the Book of Songs (nos. 3, 154, 215 and 292). Although there are no surviving examples of rhinoceros horn cups from this period, imitation rhinoceros horn cups are known, such as a version made of jade from the tomb of King Zhao Mo of Nanyue (reigned 137‚Äì122 BC). The earliest surviving examples of rhinoceros cups are examples held at the Sh≈çs≈çin treasure house in Nara, Japan, that date to the Tang Dynasty. During the Tang dynasty cups like these were used as presents for successful candidates in the imperial examinations. Cups made out of rhinoceros horn were very popular during the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing (1644‚Äì1912) dynasties, when they were used as libation cups for ritual purposes. Many examples of Ming and Qing rhinoceros horn cups are held in museums and private collections, and in recent years a number of rhinoceros horn cups have sold for large sums of money: * a 17th-century cup sold for ¬£80,000 in 2010 * a 17th-century cup sold for ¬£300,000 in 2011 * 5 cups were valued at $1m to $1.5m in 2011 In addition to cups, rhinoceros horn was also sometimes used to make other objects, such as medicine / snuff bottles, hair pins, belt hooks, and dress toggles. Due to high demand for rhinoceros horn medicine, rhinoceros horn carvings were ground down for medicine. Whilst the popularity of libation cups has aided their survival, it appears far fewer of these other examples have survived.

Career Jamieson is from New Zealand. Jamieson first entered the film industry with the New Zealand branch of Warner Bros. in 1977. He was later transferred to the United Kingdom. After his success publicizing Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Peter Yates' The Deep, he was named the International Publicist of the Year. He moved to the United States in 1984. During the 1980s, he was in charge of all the company's theatrical marketing in Latin America, the Far East, South Africa, Europe, Australia and New Zealand; he was later promoted to head of International Marketing and Publicity, which made him responsible for home video marketing internationally. He also collaborated with Stanley Kubrick to promote Full Metal Jacket; they continued to work together until Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's last film before his death in 1999. The Times Colonist called Jamieson a \\"respected film preservationist\\". In his work at Warner Home Video, Jamieson shepherded the restorations of numerous classical films. In 2002, Jamieson helped produce Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin, with Richard Schickel, which was shown at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Two years later, he collaborated with Schickel to reconstruct The Big Red One, by Sam Fuller. The two readded 47 minutes of previously cut material. The reconstruction won several awards, including the Seattle Film Critics Awards and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. He later released a reconstruction of Sam Peckinpah's 1969 film The Wild Bunch. By March 2006 he had opened his own production agency, Redwind Productions, and in 2007 released the company's first production, Cannes All Access, a look at the social impact of the Cannes Film Festival.

When Pierce (Chevy Chase) returns and asks to rejoin the group, Jeff resists, arguing they can be friends outside the study group. Abed (Danny Pudi) panics when he learns Cougar Town has been pushed to mid-season. In the group's first biology class, Professor Kane (Michael K. Williams) kicks Jeff out over his phone. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), seeking to improve Greendale, orders the removal of the monkey in the air vents using knockout gas. He confronts Vice Dean Laybourne (John Goodman) over the Air Conditioning Repair Annex's spending; Laybourne invites Pelton to his office later. Britta (Gillian Jacobs) shows Abed Cougarton Abbey, the inspiration for Cougar Town. Jeff searches for a new class for the group, but Annie (Alison Brie) uses Jeff's earlier speech to argue they do not have to take a class together. As Jeff leaves, Pierce announces he is now in biology. Abed realizes Cougarton Abbey only has six episodes and panics again. Jeff, feeling isolated, sees Chang (Ken Jeong) living in the vents and realizes he needs to rejoin the group. Pelton meets with Laybourne; Laybourne explains that his annex is highly successful and forces Pelton to stop interfering. Jeff asks Kane about rejoining biology; Kane tells Jeff to give up the phone and to stop closing himself off. Jeff, noticing a picture of Pierce, becomes convinced that Pierce bribed Kane. He grabs the photo to show to the group, but Chang steals it. Jeff follows Chang into the vents and is knocked out by the \\"monkey gas\\".

It also may provide indirect evidence of ovulation and fertility, although it does not predict the time of ovulation. Ferning occurs due to the presence of sodium chloride in mucus under estrogen effect. When high levels of estrogen are present, just before ovulation, the cervical mucus forms fern- like patterns due to crystallization of sodium chloride on mucus fibers.

The \\"Strip,\\" as called by the locals, begins at the eastern terminus of the Texas Street Bridge which connects Shreveport and Bossier City (the bridge was completed in the 1930s by then Governor O.K. Allen). The Strip was most popular as an entertainment destination between the 1940s and the 1970s.Bossier Parish, (Images of America: Louisiana) by Clifton D. Cardin (Jul 17, 1999) The Strip begins at the foot of the Texas Street Bridge and extends East to Louisiana Downs racetrack near Red Chute Bayou. The heart of the Strip, where the majority of clubs were located at the height of its popularity, was from the Texas Street Bridge to Swan Lake Road. Gambling was legalized in the state in 1990State of Louisiana Office of Addictive Disorders, 2002 Louisiana Study of Problem Gambling, P1, leading to the development of casinos along the Red River and the eventual decline of the Bossier Strip as a focus for entertainment. The Strip has been the home of bars and brothels almost since the incorporation of the city in 1907. From about 1930 through the late 1940s the Bossier Strip was as popular an entertainment destination as Las Vegas, having been around for many years prior to the establishment of Las Vegas as a gambling mecca.Las Vegas Casinos and Past Mob TiesThe Strip, it may be argued, continued with some interruptions east of Bossier City along U.S. Highway 80 to the Bossier- Webster Parish line. The Strip has been the object of political disputes too.

On December 11, 1941, Cuba and the United States of America, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Nicaragua declare war on Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. On January 14, 1942, the Cuban Secretary of State (Jos√© Manuel Cortina) indicates in a diplomatic message to the American Charg√© in Cuba (Ellis O. Briggs) the following \\"I take pleasure in advising you that the Government of Cuba, inspired by the lofty sentiments of cooperation and alliance which joins the Cuban Nation with the United States of America in the present war, engaged in the territorial defense of America and of every one of the American nations, as well as of the principles of democracy and of the liberty of the peoples, has accepted the suggestions of your Government which were transmitted by the Embassy in the above- mentioned notes.\\" The above-mentioned notes were two and included 5 specific points of suggestion including in part: Stationing of US Aviation Corps Detachments in certain airfields (i.e. La F√©, in the Province of Pinar del R√≠o; Rancho Boyeros, in the Province of Habana; and in Camag√ºey); Permission to use Cuban landing fields; Permission to take photographs of Cuban territory for aerial navigation charts, etc. On June 18, the United States established Naval Air Facility (NAF) La F√©, Cuba. The US NAVY Code Word for La F√© was HUMPBACK. U.S. Navy bases in Cuba fell under the command of the Gulf Sea Frontier headquartered at Miami, Florida (after a brief stint based at Key West). June 26, the United States established Naval Air Auxiliary Station (NAAS) (Lighter-than-Air), San Juli√°n, Cuba. This was in response to Nazi Germany announcing unrestricted submarine warfare off the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Specifically, the United States Navy recognized the need to augment antisubmarine patrols in the Yucat√°n Channel. NAAS San Juli√°n was established on the western tip of Cuba near Pan American World Airways' Isabel Rubio Emergency Landing Field. August 6, in Havana, Cuba the U.S. Secretary for State announced that negotiations had been conducted between Cuba and the United States for the establishment of the air base in San Juli√°n, Pinar del R√≠o Province. September 7, Cuba and United States sign a new Naval and Military Agreement of Cooperation. The strategic importance of Cuba for the air and maritime communications of United States and the importance of its production of sugar obliged them to reinforce the island. The Pinar del R√≠o area was considered ideally situated for further development and the Army began construction by expanding the existing Pan American airfield on November 1. :A second air base was negotiated between Cuba and the United States and known as San Antonio de los Ba√±os Airfield. The air base was also known as the Cayuga was built near a town of the same name in the Havana Province, by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the San Juli√°n Air Base in the Guanahacabibes peninsula in Pinar del R√≠o was also built. The United States flew patrols in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to hunt German submarines (U-boats). The USAAF flew out of San Antonio de los Ba√±os and the US NAVY used San Juli√°n. September 22, the USAAF began to organize the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFAC), using the I Bomber Command as its core for personnel and aircraft. The USAAF had been engaged in anti-submarine war for almost a year. During that time it had laid the basis for an effective organization and made plans for a larger anti-submarine force. The new AAFAC was constituted on October 13 and activated on October 15, 1942. Simultaneously, I Bomber Command was inactivated the same day. :The principal mission of AAFAC was to be \\"the location and destruction of hostile submarines wherever they may be operating\\". As a necessary means to this end it had the secondary mission of training crews and developing devices and techniques. The command was to be a direct reporting agency to the Commanding General, United States Army Air Forces, although its operations on the US NAVY Eastern and Gulf Sea Frontiers were to be conducted under the tactical control of US NAVY officials. The former I Bomber Command furnished the personnel, aircraft, and equipment for the new organization. November 20, AAFAC had organized the squadrons it had inherited from I Bomber Command into the 25th and 26th anti- submarine Wings with headquarters at New York and Miami respectively. = 1943 = January 1, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) set up postal operations for San Juli√°n using a non-descript number. They used Army Post Office, Miami with the address: 2754 APO MIA. Although the facility was under USAAF administration and operational control all air activities and operations were US Navy. April 1, USAAF transferred control of NAAS San Juli√°n to the Navy. The first Commander of the base was Lieutenant Commander Beckwith Havens, USN. The US NAVY likewise used a non-descript number for postal operations. They used Fleet Post Office, Atlantic located in New York City with the address: 301 FPO NY July 1, construction was completed and the new facility was re-designated Naval Air Facility (NAF) San Juli√°n. :The US Navy's Airship Squadron Twenty One (ZP-21) established a number of detachments at advance bases to provide ASW, rescue, escort and utility services in its area of operations, i.e. CARIB (Caribbean). These detachments were maintained throughout the war and located at: NAF San Juli√°n; Santa Fe, Isle of Pines, Cuba; NAS Banana River, Fla.; Meacham Satellite Naval Air Field, Key West, Fla.; NAS Houma, La.; NAS San Juan, Puerto Rico; NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and La Chorrera Army Airfield, Panama. October 1, the US Navy's Bombing Squadron One Hundred Twenty Five (VB-125) sent a three-aircraft detachment to NAF San Juli√°n for ASW patrols. =1944= May 1, VB-125 transferred from Boca Chica, Florida, to NAF San Juli√°n, joining the detachment sent there previously. The squadron was under the operational control of Fleet Airship Wing Twelve (FAW-12) and stayed in San Juli√°n until February 11, 1945 when they we relieved by VPB-145. Between mid-1942 until early 1944, seven Cuban ships were sunken by German submarines (U-Boats) in actions where more than eighty Cuban mariners and three Americans were killed. = 1945 = Many American squadrons trained in Cuba in navigation, bombing, air-to-air combat and close air support. A fighter squadron of P-39 Airacobras was placed in San Antonio for their defense. Towards the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945 intense training was conducted by the USAAF 509th Composite Group using B-29s. These were tests in preparation for dropping the Atomic Bomb on Japan. They trained in long-range over-water navigation from Cuba into the Caribbean in order to acclimate themselves to similar conditions in the Pacific Ocean. From Cuba the B-29s flew to the Marianas Islands in the Pacific, in June 1945. These same aircraft would carry atomic bombs to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Among them also was the Enola Gay. February 8, by means of Decree 409, the control of civil aviation is transferred from the Cuban Army to the newly created Commission of National Transportation. =Post-World War II= May 20, 1946 NAF San Juli√°n was disestablished. :Both airports were passed to the Cuban Army for the use of the Aviation Corps after the War during the government of President Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n. San Antonio de los Ba√±os Air Base was used by the military aviation at all times, however San Juli√°n Air Base was used to host the San Julian Aircraft Technical School for both military and commercial aviation. May 2, 1952 by Decree Law No. 41, the Civil Aeronautics Board (Direcci√≥n General de Transporte A√©reo) is created. June 1952 the Army Aviation Corps changes to Cuban Army Airforce (FAEC). December 22, 1954 the Commission of Civil Aeronautics is created by Law-Decree 1863. =Bay of Pigs Invasion= Early preparations for the invasion included the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front (FRD) on October 26, 1960 distributing its first Combat Order. In general terms, the order describes the logistics of an attack on the San Juli√°n air base. That plan calls for seizing the airfield and using it as an operational base for \\"our air and land force.\\" The order also describes how supplies will be obtained and communications handled during the operations. Planning for the invasion included targeting numerous military bases including San Antonio de los Ba√±os Air Base, the Campo Libertad Air Base, and the naval bases at Batabano and Nueva Gerona (on the Isle of Pines). San Juli√°n Air Base was placed on the primary target list.

It is a Grade I listed building. History and architecture Construction of the church began in the late 12th century. From this period date the tower, the north and south walls of the nave and the lower chancel, all of which were constructed with uncoursed stone and tufa rubble walls. The chapels on the north side were added in the 14th century. The steeply pitched roof is covered with clay tiles. 14th-century doorway on the north side of the nave The square tower is attached to the south side of the church at the junction between the nave and the chancel. It is buttressed on both faces of the external corners and has been extended vertically with a 16th-century timber weatherboarded belfry topped by a timber hipped roof and an octagonal timber spire. On the east side of the tower is a partly projecting stair tower and a blocked-in doorway. Small rectangular and lancet windows pierce the tower at each level; those on the stair tower dating from the 13th or 14th centuries. The short nave features a rubble walled windowless porch attached to the south side in the 19th century and a gabled west end rebuilt in the same century with a window of four lights in the 13th- century style. A two-lighted window on the north side is 13th-century and the two-lighted windows on the right and left sides of the porch are 14th- and 19th-century respectively. On the north side of the nave, a blocked-in doorway with a pointed arch surrounded by a carved rectangular architrave is 14th- century. The three windows on the south side of the chancel, the lancet window on its north side and the three-lighted window in the east end are all 19th- century, but in a 13th-century style. Attached centrally to the north side of the nave and chancel as a pitched-roofed extension, the chapels include three two-lighted windows, the one in the nave chapel being quatrefoiled. The roof to the nave is supported on three crown posts on unbraced tie beams. The roof to the chancel is 19th-century and boarded. Furnishings and monuments Internally, a 14th-century font is set on a chamfered base with a face, two calves' heads and a leaf. Monuments in the chancel are to Thomas Hendley (d. 1590), Levinus Buffkin (d. 1622), John Hendley (d. 1676), Thomas Fludd (d. 1688) and William and Dorothea Henley (d. 1762 and 1785). In the Chancel chapel are monuments to Elizabeth Hendley (d. 1697) and Bowyer Hendley (d. 1742). The churchyard contains two Grade II listed monuments.

KICS affords children of all nationalities an education similar to that offered by schools in the USA. The mission at KICS is to provide a Christ-centered, U.S. accredited primary and secondary education that challenges students to excel academically and live out a biblical worldview. The vision of KICS to impact the world for Christ by preparing servant leaders who choose character before career, wisdom beyond scholarship, service above self, and a lifestyle of participation over apathy. KICS serves over 300 students from around 27 different nationalities and is recognized as a leading international school in Kigali. KICS is a project of U.S. 501(c)3 ROC Partners. http://www.kicsrw.org KICS received two accreditations in 2012. One was from the Association of Christian schools International (ACSI) and the second was from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA). Kigali International Community School is located at Caisse Sociale Estates, Gaculiro, BP 6558, Kigali, Rwanda. It has been an Association of Christian Schools International Continuous Member since 2007.ACSI member list Kigali International Community School (KICS), is a community made of staff, students and parents dedicated to preparing servant leaders to impact the world for Christ. History The vision of Kigali International Community School (KICS) began in November 2005 as expatriate Christian families came together to seek answers for their children‚Äôs educational needs. As these families prayed and planned a vision was formed around the key principles of an English medium school using an American curriculum with a distinctly Christian philosophy. KICS was primarily established to meet the educational needs of the families of evangelical missionaries and Christian cross-cultural workers. The founders of KICS envisioned it to primarily be a support ministry for these families whose children would be more easily able to eventually transition back into American schools. While KICS still prioritizes the children of missionaries and expatriate Christians it serves a diverse student body. By January 2006 these families began several clusters of home school cooperatives. In September 2006 these clusters joined at a four-bedroom home of Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in Kacyiru. The founding board members at KICS were serving with the following organizations: Christ‚Äôs Church in Rwanda (CCR), World Relief, Opportunity Bank, Food for the Hungry International (FHI), Compassion International, and a USAID funded project. In November 2006, Rwanda Outreach Community Partners (ROC) was formed as 501c3 in the state of Oklahoma to purchase the Caisse Sociale school and hall located in the Vision 2020 Estate of Gaculiro on behalf of Christ‚Äôs Church in Rwanda (CCR). The property was purchased in February 2007. ROC Partners invited KICS to move into the school property in April 2007 as a partner in Christian education with ROC and CCR. In order for KICS to be financially sustainable Food for the Hungry International moved their office to the ROC property and stayed until August 2008. FHI and ROC investments enabled KICS to be sustained through its early days as it transitioned to its new environment with a growing patronage. Teachers initially came as volunteers seconded to KICS from Food for the Hungry, World Relief, and Christ‚Äôs Church in Rwanda. As Kigali experienced a rapid growth of expatriate personnel the need for a quality international school grew and there became conflicting visions for KICS that led to the beginning of a transition in the spring of 2009. These conflicting visions ultimately led to a solidified Christian ethos and re-commitment to serving missionaries and Christian cross-cultural workers while honoring our host country with a substantial portion of the enrollment going to national families. In September 2009 ROC Partners became the owner agency of KICS. This alignment of property and institutional ownership solidified KICS position as a legitimate institution in the eyes of KICS host nation. The KICS founding vision was also solidified by a renewable Memorandum of Understanding with Africa Inland Mission (AIM), and the merger of the former missionary home school coop, Jungle School, with KICS. AIM‚Äôs partnership and the Jungle School/KICS merger are a demonstration of the philosophy of unity and partnership among Christians serving in Rwanda. These partnerships and a unified mission for KICS have served to help make KICS a highly sought after education in Kigali with students having attended KICS from over 35 nationalities. In August 2010 KICS began its self-study for ACSI/MSA accreditation that became effective January 1, 2012. As part of that process KICS completed the construction of a Media Center/Library and Science Laboratory in July 2012. This was phase II of a three-phase development plan. Phase I was completed in the summers of 2010 and 2011 through modifications of the Primary building. Phase three was the anticipated need for facilities expansion although not defined specifically at this time. In 2013 KICS built a full-size basketball court giving it the potential to offer basketball and volleyball in addition to an already popular football program. In 2015 KICS had its midterm accreditation visit with a positive report from accrediting institutions thanks to being ahead of schedule in KICS‚Äôs Continuous School Improvement Plan. With KICS substantial institutional and academic growth it is poised to finish its first 7-year accreditation with high marks as it launches into the future. In 2016 KICS began its vision toward capital expansion on the current compound and built a new classroom building in conjunction with the addition of a PK and duel streaming of students in KG and G7. This growth reflects KICS plans for continued growth and development that will impact generations.

The species is endemic to South America.\\"Micrurus lemniscatus \\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile- database.org. Consulted 03 October 2014.  Description and Behavior  It is a thin and brightly colored species, adults measure 60-90 cm in length, the maximum previously reported was 145 cm, the front of the head is black and with a narrow white ring in front of the eyes, the eyes are small and the rest of the head is red. The body pattern consists of slightly broad red rings that are separated by 7 to 17 triads of 3 black and white rings, the tail has 2 black triads alternating with white rings. Like many coral snakes, it is nocturnal and terrestrial, digging loose soil or litter, it is not aggressive towards humans, although it can attack to defend itself. Breeding is Oviparous, having a litter of possibly 20 eggs. Limentation is mainly related to other snakes, lizards and invertebrates.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf Geographic range and Habitat M. lemniscatus is found in Argentina, northern Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, eastern Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, eastern Peru, Suriname, Trinidad, and Venezuela. It is a widespread species in South America, they live in humid forests and lowland lowland forests, in open savannas and gallery forests. It is also found in lowland floodplains, deforested areas or near human habitation, in humid areas or near places with a water source, it occurs near sea level, at an altitude of 1,000 m.  Venom  The venom of M. lemniscatus is a potent post- and pre-synaptic neurotoxin, which causes a potent and irreversible neuromuscular block in vertebrate. Lemnitoxin, a potent myotoxic PLA2 type toxin, isolated from the venom of M. lemniscatus induces local and systemic myotoxicity after intramuscular and intravenous injection in mice, which is antigenically related to Micrurus nigrocinctus nigroxin, Notechis scutatus notexin, mulgotoxin of Pseudechis australis and textilotoxin of Pseudonaja textilis.

It has given hip-hop artists the ability to create and share music at incredible rates. Through the constant influx of new music being posted online by artists, new styles and genres of hip hop have been created. Hip hop before the Web According to media analyst Kembrew McLeod, before hip-hop artists could upload music online to be shared with large audiences, they had to rely heavily on record labels, which agreed to sell an artist's music, under certain conditions which usually gave the record label more money from each sale than the artist. To this day, hip-hop artists still make only a small percentage of profit from the royalties of record sales. In some cases, creating and selling an album leaves an artist in debt, because they are responsible for funding the recording of the album, as well as the production of the music videos that are used to promote these albums. Some hip-hop artists end up only breaking even with record companies after they produce an album, because of all of the expenses that they pay to effectively market and produce their albums and the small percentage of royalties received. Impact of the Web on hip hop =Hip-hop artists' Web usage= At the beginning of the 21st century, record sales began to dip quickly, because of the rise of peer-to-peer file sharing. In order to offset the revenue lost to illegal downloading, record companies began restructuring the traditional deals. As a result, fewer record deals were offered to hip-hop artists, and those that were offered were even more favorable to record companies. A common deal offered to artists was the \\"360 deal\\", which gave the record company complete artistic and business control over their artist's music. Hip hop started out as an underground genre, with very little support from the general public. Over the years, it garnered massive mainstream success; and hip-hop artists, like artists of all genres, began to depend heavily on the record companies to get their music out. The Web provided artists with a new way to sell music, without dealing with record companies. The do-it-yourself ethic propagated by the Web encouraged many artists to produce and sell music on their own or collaboratively with other artists. =Impact of digitally released mix tapes= With the ability to share music with large audiences across the web, hip-hop artists began creating and distributing mix tapes on the web. In 2007, rapper Lil Wayne rose to fame for releasing hundreds of original songs online to the public. The songs were free downloads in the form of mix tapes, on which he built songs from the beats of other artists. An example of this was his double-mix-tape release Da Drought 3. All of his mix tapes were either unofficially leaked or posted on the Web. Although Lil Wayne did not profit directly from these free mix tapes he did benefit indirectly: the ideas and feedback that he collected while making the mix tapes helped him create his bestselling commercial album Tha Carter III. Released in June 2008, Tha Carter III sold nearly three million copies, making it the top-selling recording of the year in the United States. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album that year. Since then, hip-hop artists have followed in the same path as Lil Wayne, using freely released mix tapes to develop their skills and build popularity. =Impact of blogs= Modern-day hip hop has been greatly impacted by the availability of blogs on the Web. Various blogs, such as XXL, Thisis50, HotNewHipHop, Rap-Up and Raptology feature services for amateur artists to post their music to audiences on their website. These services usually have a rating system or comment section for the amateur artists to receive feedback about their submitted music. Record companies also rely on hip-hop blogs to promote the music of their artists, often leaking the songs off of their artist's albums in order to build momentum for their album releases. Rise of blogs The rise of the internet and blog culture caused the rates for print advertising to decline rapidly. Originally, few of these magazine publications were unwilling to make the jump fully from print to web-driven direction due to the lower rates for online advertising. However, more than and unlike other genres of music, hip-hop's 24/7 news cycle has a constant churn of news and music - diss tracks, radio freestyles, rumours, and illicit mixtapes that has long been the culture's hidden backbone. This market flourishes outside the market of radio singles and major label albums. Likewise, the nonstop drip-drip-drip of music leaks had become a flood. With the music industry helpless to stop up the dam, the genre had a massive, invested audience, a surplus of product, and no platform. This was the empty space a new generation of personalities and enthusiasts clambered to fill in 2009. And soon business was booming. As more and more readers shifted to the Internet for daily news and music, there was a huge opportunity to shape the conversation‚Äîand few magazines aggressively pursuing online audiences. In their place grew an ad hoc collection of independent hip-hop blogs, which rose in influence disproportionate to their small size, when compared with the fully staffed magazines that came before them. In 2008, while print media foundered, seven of the biggest brand names in hip-hop blogging came together to form the New Music Cartel, whose members became the gatekeepers in a new era for hip-hop media: 2DopeBoyz, RapCastle, YouHeardThatNew, Xclusives Zone, AllRapNews, Miss Info, DaJaz1, and the father of them all, Raptology. =Impact of social media outlets= In order to promote their music, both independent and mainstream hip-hop artists have begun to utilize social-networking sites. Independent artists rely heavily on social networking sites as a medium to give their fans music, and to get instantaneous feedback on it. For example, the former-underground rap group Odd Future relied on the social networking site Tumblr to release free mixtapes to their fans. Their Tumblr releases and mixtapes were met with such acclaim and positive feedback that they were able to start their own record label and go on a North American tour. Twitter especially has become a platform for hip-hop artists. Unlike any time before, artists now have the ability to remain constantly in contact with their fans through continual updates and new content, and to further grow their initial fan base on a massive scale. According to a hip-hop panel at the music festival South by Southwest called \\"From the Blocks to the Blogs\\", Twitter can be \\"used as a tool to connect to fans but also as a way to prove to labels and tastemakers that they actually do have a following.\\" Major artists also used social- networking sites to promote their music. For example, in the summer of 2010, mainstream hip-hop artist Kanye West used his Twitter page to announce that he would be giving out free music to fans via the G.O.O.D. Fridays series that he created, as well as using it to announce release dates and details about his future commercial releases. In a relatively short period of time, social media software, apps and sites have become another audience-building resource available to artists, allowing them to release music and sell products ‚àí without being forced to rely on often reluctant or short-sighted record label executives to do all this for them when they decide get around to it or find the funds. Today's social media-astute artist is no longer a record label's product or property as in the past. Instead, today's artist-entrepreneur can become master of his or her own brand on his or her own terms. With the widespread adoption of social media platforms, the veil of mystery that once served as a buffer between artists and fans has now been lifted. Through photos, videos and tweets, you can see what your favourite artists are doing day to day and hear their opinions on a variety of topics. It's a relationship that's become more than just the music. It's personal. Fans learn to appreciate the person behind the music. This strengthened connection between artists and fan fosters a new level of investment in artists. =Impact on Rap Beef= As a genre that was born from battling and competition, beef has always been at the backbone of hip-hop culture. However, as the Internet has completely revolutionized everything from how artists build buzz to how they promote and distribute their albums, social media in particular has changed how rappers argue with one another. In 2014, you are hard pressed to find a nice piece of rap beef that didn't play out at least partly over Twitter, Instagram, or Vine. There's the blatant Twitter call-outs that lead to in-song and online back-and-forths, the sub-tweets and sneak disses that take a conflict from 0-100 real quick, the confusing fight Vines, the ominous unfollows, the passive aggressive Instagram likes, and much, much more. With the millions of followers an artist has, there is no surprise how much attention their tweets get ‚Äì especially if it is a war of words against another rapper. Twitter and Instagram are both public arenas and when rappers are feuding, fans and other celebrities will also voice their opinions and take sides. The most talked about rap feud in 2015 was Drake versus Meek Mill. It all started when the Philly rapper insulted Drake on Twitter for allegedly using ghostwriters. After receiving no response from Drake, fans, other rappers, producers, and radio personalities quickly took sides on social media. The anticipation to hear from Drake was real. After a week of silence, Drake responded with the song ‚ÄúCharged Up‚Äù. And with the unenthused articles and tweets about the track, Drake hit back with ‚ÄúBack to Back‚Äù. Then came the memes, viral tweets and Instagram responses. When Meek released his ‚ÄúWanna Know‚Äù comeback, the conversation that ensued went viral and kept that status for weeks. Drake could not help but become a part of it and he ended up posting an Instagram response by uploading a caption-less photo of him laughing. On the positive side, arguments taking place largely over the Internet means the disputes are kept mostly on the e-streets and out of the real streets, avoiding the violence that has tragically plagued hip-hop in the past. On the other hand, the general ease and lack of accountability of social media mean these arguments are becoming incredibly common and extremely repetitive. Independent Web artists challenging old ideas Hip-hop music blogs and e-communities brought about the creation of new subgenres and styles within hip hop. An example of a new style coming into existence because of the Web is rapper Lil B, who is known for his unconventional use of flow-and-rhyme scheme in his rap music. Lil B's music is very different from most mainstream hip-hop music. However, he built a solid following partially because of his extensive use of social media sites, and also due to the constant controversial and thought provoking music, which he makes available for free online. In 2011, Lil B decided to challenge the hegemonic attitudes that the hip-hop community has towards homosexuality when he announced that his next album would be entitled I'm Gay (I'm Happy). Lil B's album title garnered caused so much outrage in the hip-hop community that he began receiving death threats. Once released, Lil B's album I'm Gay (I'm Happy) garnered positive feedback from critics and hip-hop artists alike. Successful mainstream rapper Lupe Fiasco went so far as to call the album \\"genius\\".

Currently, The Sons are composed of lead singer/main songwriter and guitarist/pianist Paul Herron, multi- instrumentalist and vocalist Steven Herron, guitarist and vocalist Stewart English, bassist Lee Blades, and percussionist Roger Millichamp. The band runs their own record label Cannon Fodder Recordings. History =Early days= The Sons' origins trace back to 1994, when Paul Herron met Ken Reeves while attending the University of Derby and the two of them, both aspiring singer/songwriters and guitarists, decided to form a band. Herron and Reeves soon recruited a bass player, Lee Blades, and a drummer, Matt Dewsnap, by hanging up posters around campus. When Herron and Reeves discovered that Blades lived only two doors down from their house on Uttoxeter New Road, Derby, the quartet adopted the name \\"New Road\\" as their band name. New Road continued to play local venues like The Garrick in and around Derby until Reeves left for southern England in 1996. Before Reeves‚Äô departure, New Road connected with Stewart English, the owner of Clostrophobia Recording Studios on Agard Street in Derby, and began recording one of the first of the band‚Äôs many demos. Unfortunately, English was later forced to close his studio, but quickly joined New Road ‚Äì though, soon after the addition of English, Dewsnap left the group due to friendly but creative differences, and was replaced by Matthew Paton. The change in line-up inspired a change in name ‚Äì from New Road to Sub-marine ‚Äì and the band continued to hone their skills by playing shows in their native Derby, London and France. =The Sons= In 2003, the band self-financed and released their first single \\"One Man Floats\\", followed by the four track EP1 in 2004. The release of \\"One Man Floats\\" required the band to settle on a permanent name, and after drawing up a list of possibilities, they settled on The Sons. =Visiting Hours and Popup-Records= After promoting several demos without being signed by a label, the band decided to produce and distribute their first album, Visiting Hours in 2007, followed by a seven-date British tour in the summer of 2008. =The Prime Words Committee and American release= The Prime Words Committee was recorded at Snug Recording Co. in Derby between May 2010 and February 2011. The thirteen tracks on the album were selected from nineteen completed tracks and the remaining six were set aside for future B-sides. At the special request of a Swiss fan that had previously seen the band at Gaswerk, The Sons flew into Zurich and played a private party at Portier in Winterthur on 10 September 2011. The Sons' Heading Into Land won the award for \\"Adult Contemporary Album\\" at The 2015 14th Annual Independent Music Awards.

(also M√°quina!) was a Spanish prog rock and psychedelic rock group from Barcelona. It was formed in 1969 and disbanded in 1972. They were pioneers of progressive rock in Catalonia and Spain and their first album Why? is widely considered one of the most memorable Spanish prog rock albums from the 70s. Overview M√°quina has its origins as a backing band called La Companyia, SL for singers and groups of the musical folk association Grup de Folk in 1968, collaborating with Jaume Sisa, Pau Riba, Miniatura and others. Grup de Folk disappeared as an association in 1968. After that, two of its members, Jordi Batiste and Enric Herrera, decided to electrify themselves and swap into rock music in 1969. This bunch of Catalan youngsters led by the Batiste-Herrera tandem became soon the most prominent and visible heads of the grassroots movement which shake the foundations of the city's musical world at the beginning of the seventies and which can be considered as the parting shot for progressive rock in Spain. Their first EP Lands of Perfection was released in August 1969 with Jordi Batiste (bass, lead vocals), Enric Herrera (hammond, piano, back vocals), Luigi Cabanach (guitar, back vocals) and Jackie Garc√≠a (drums). Their second Ep Earth's Daughter, was released at the end of the same year with a new drummer, Tapi Vilaseca. Why?, their debut album (1970, also known as the \\"croissant\\" LP) is widely regarded in and out of Spain as one of the best records ever to come out of Spain. A wah wah, fuzz & hammond feast by this talented pioneering crew. It was recorded by Jordi Batiste (bass, lead vocals, flute), Enric Herrera (Hammond, keyboard, piano), Luigi Cabanach (guitar, bass, back vocals), Tapi Vilaseca (drums) and Josep Maria Par√≠s (guitar). Batiste had to left the band before finishing the album to join the army in the compulsory military service that in those years lasted around 15 months. Par√≠s came as his replacement but it was Cabanach who got Batiste's role singing and playing the bass while Par√≠s became the lead guitarist. The only song in which the five musicians play together is in Why?. Maquina! never was a five-piece band. In September of the same year, Enric Herrera also had to leave the band for military service and Maquina! played for a while months as a trio. Keyboardist √Ålvaro Is, a friend of Par√≠s, joined the band to play Herrera's part. In January 1971, Luigi Cabanach left the band to do the military service leaving the band without any of their original members in the line-up. Soon after, √Ålvaro Is left the band to play in Sweden. Being reduced to two members, Par√≠s decided to give up the band and come back to Sweden, where he used to live before joining Maquina! Tapi would then make a new band (Tapiman) to play the gigs previously booked to Maquina. In early 1971, Enric Herrera, while doing the military service, decide to redo the band and try some different styles. The new line-up included three teenagers from the band Crac that refused a contract to make their first album to join Enric Herrera in his new project. The other members were constantly changing, except the German saxophonist Peter Rohr. Jordi Batiste declined to join the new line-up. They added the new influences of jazz-rock, blues, soul and funk to their style and the four-piece band became an eight-piece with brass players. One of the new members was a 16 years old Carles Benavent. This change was inspired by the success of bands as Blood, Sweat and Tears and Chicago Transit Authority. Maquina! might also be considered the first jazz-rock band in Catalonia and Spain. Their second and last LP, En directo, was recorded as a live concert in July 1972 with the collaboration of founder member Jordi Batiste as a singer.  Discography  *Why?

It was released on February 10, 1967. Rolling Stone listed it as number 476 in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Production Aretha Franklin (pictured in 2008) disappeared for weeks while recording \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\" was written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn. It was produced by Jerry Wexler. Franklin began recording the song in 1967 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, after completing \\"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\\". During the session, Franklin's then-husband and manager Ted White got upset over something trumpeter Ken Laxton said, and at the motel afterwards Rick Hall's attempt to explain things resulted in a fight between him and White. The following morning, it was found that Franklin and White had left with the song still unfinished. Penn recalled: Franklin disappeared for several weeks, later reappearing in New York City. She then finished the song with the help of her sisters Carolyn and Erma. Penn recalled: Composition At the beginning of the song, Franklin sings with a gospel-inspired tone, which continues through the bridge. Through overdubbing, Franklin plays both the piano and the organ. According to Bill Janovitz of Allmusic, \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\" contrasts the power of temptation and rewards of fidelity. He notes that its melody is \\"soothing\\". Patricia Hill Collins writes that it has a feminist message, urging African-American men to respect women as their equals and not follow the then-common belief that it is \\"a man's world\\" by using or abusing them; she also writes that the song urges men to be loyal, responsible, and \\"sexually expressive\\". Although the song is originally heavily inspired by soul, covers have different styles. For example, The Flying Burrito Brothers cover in 1969 was a \\"country-soul waltz\\". Reception \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\" spent 11 weeks on the charts, peaking at number 9. It was included on Franklin's album I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You and the single was released as the b-side to \\"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\\". It also reached number 37 on the R&B; chart. Wexler called it \\"perfection\\". In 2004, Rolling Stone selected \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\" as one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. As of the 2010 edition, it is ranked 476th. In the 1991 film Cape Fear, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) tries to seduce a teenage girl (Juliette Lewis) while dancing with her to the song.

From the first service of fewer than ten people in their living room in the city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe in 1995, this church has grown to more than 6000 in attendance on a single Sunday service. Due to the limitation of space, the current building can not take the number of people hence a total of ten services are carried out on a Sunday. Senior Pastors Colin and Sarah Nyathi are parents of five adult children. Colin was previously a financial director of a large engineering house in Bulawayo before becoming a full-time pastor. Sarah, an entrepreneur, was Miss Lux Zimbabwe and has been involved in much training of young entrepreneurs in her nation. Colin functions in the apostolic office and is an unapologetic church planter. He moves tremendously in the ministry of the Holy Spirit and his church has been known for unusual manifestations. They host a television programme dubbed \\"Open Heavens\\" which features in Southern Africa. Sarah runs \\"Maximised Lifestyle International\\", an arm of HHI Church that helps ladies within the church to be self-sufficient and grow spiritually and in real life. This couple offers spiritual oversight to all their pastors and elders as well as a number from other churches. Church Premises Currently, their services are held in ten different venues across the city centre with the new headquarters now situated at Corner 10th Avenue & George Silundika.

Drummond served as an officer in the French Army, but is perhaps best known for his participation in the Jacobite rising of 1745, during which he was one of the senior Jacobite staff officers in addition to leading the Jacobite Royal Scots, a regiment raised by him in France. Early life John Drummond was born in 1714 in France; he was the second son of James Drummond, 5th titular Earl and 2nd Duke of Perth, and Jane, daughter of George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon. His family were Catholics and committed Stuart loyalists: his grandfather the 4th Earl, the former Lord Chancellor of Scotland, had accompanied James II into exile in France before being created Duke of Perth in the Jacobite Peerage by James's son James Edward Stuart. John Drummond's father did not succeed to the earldom, having been attainted for participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715, though the Drummonds continued to style themselves using the family titles. John Drummond's father had preserved the family estates in Scotland by transferring them to his oldest son James before the 1715 rising. Both sons were brought up by their mother at Drummond Castle in Perthshire until their father's death in 1720, when they were sent to the Scots College, Douai. John was said to have shown a preference for military subjects; he subsequently joined the French army as an officer, eventually reaching the rank of Captain in the Irish Brigade's Regiment Roth, the lineal descendant of Dorrington's Irish Foot Guards. A return to Scotland during the 1730s rekindled his enthusiasm for the country.Corp, \\"The Scottish Jacobite Community at St-Germain\\" in Macinnes (ed) (2015) Living with Jacobitism, 1690‚Äì1788: The Three Kingdoms and Beyond, Routledge, p.34 Drummond was a prominent figure in the Jacobite exile community at Saint-Germain, living on the first floor of the chateau during the winter of 1743‚Äì4. Along with his brother James, he is supposed to have partly inspired Charles Edward Stuart's interest in Scotland: he presented Charles with a complete set of Highland weapons and his brother gave him clothing and a book of Scottish dances. Charles, however, seems to have found Drummond disrespectful and hard to get along with: in May 1745 he wrote to his father James claiming that \\"it is impossible [Drummond] can escape sooner or later from having his throat cut, for he is dayly affronting people and doing durty things\\".McCorry, Helen C. \\"RATS, LICE AND SCOTCHMEN: Scottish Infantry Regiments in the Service of France, 1742-62.\\" Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research 74, no. 297 (1996): 18 Drummond's quarrels with another of the Paris exiles, Sir Hector Maclean, required the intervention from Rome of James himself;Tayler (1948) A Jacobite Miscellany, Roxburghe Club, p.191 Jacobite agent Murray of Broughton later suggested Drummond harboured ambitions to be made the main Jacobite representative in France. The Regiment Royal-Ecossais While service as a mercenary abroad had relatively neutral connotations in the period,McCorry, 3 many Scots disliked serving in the Irish Brigade regiments, making recruitment difficult.Wemyss, A. (2003) Elcho of the '45, Saltire Society, p.46 The French government accordingly gave Drummond a commission to raise a Scottish regiment, the Regiment Royal- Ecossais or Royal Scots, with a view to its possible employment during a future invasion of Britain. A report written by the British agent \\"A.M.\\" or \\"Pickle the Spy\\", now thought to have been Alastair Ruadh MacDonnell of Glengarry, claimed that Sir Hector Maclean was originally intended to be Lieutenant-Colonel, but Drummond \\"got a stop to [his] obtaining the Commission\\".Maclean-Bristol, Nicholas. \\"JACOBITE OFFICERS IN THE SCOTS BRIGADE IN DUTCH SERVICE\\" Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research vol 82, no. 330 (2004), 102 An ordnance to raise the regiment was issued on 3 December 1743, France declared war on Britain in March 1744, and the regiment's first commissions were issued on 1 August. Drummond's kinsman, Lewis Drummond of Melfort, was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel while another relative, Viscount Strathallan, was given a captaincy. By December 1744 Drummond reported that the regiment had reached its full establishment: 12 companies of 55 men.Maclean-Bristol, 101 While many were Scots or, like Drummond, from Scots exile families, the Royal-Ecossais also included English and Irish deserters from the British Army. 1745 rising Drummond, the Royal Scots, the Irish Brigade picquets and a number of other French advisors and specialists were embarked at Dunkirk in late November 1745 to support the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Thanks to the Royal Navy blockade many were captured, but Drummond along with most of his regiment slipped past the blockade under the cover of a gale; the bulk landed at the Jacobite-held port of Montrose, with others reaching Stonehaven and Peterhead. On 2 December, Drummond issued a Declaration stating that they were \\"come to this Kingdom, with Written Orders, to make War against the King of England, Elector of Hanover, and all his Adherants\\";Jacobite Declaration of War, National Archives he took over from Strathallan as the Jacobite Commander-in-Chief in Scotland, in control of a force of around 3,000. The main Jacobite Army was by then approaching Derby on its march southward into England. Despite Charles's desire to press on towards London most of the army's senior leaders were troubled by the lack of visible support from English Jacobites or of a French landing in England and by news of two large government armies in pursuit. A message from Drummond confirming his arrival and promising further French reinforcement to come seemed to strengthen the argument for consolidating their position in Scotland, and on 5 December the Jacobite 'Council of War' decided to return there. At least one Jacobite memoirist, James Johnstone of Ogilvy's Regiment, later substantially blamed Drummond for the decision; \\"If Lord John Drummond [...] had advanced by forced marches, as he ought to have done [...] no-one of our army would have ever given his opinion of a retreat\\".Winchester (ed) (1870) Memoirs of the Chevalier de Johnstone, v.I, D. Wylie, p.50 Johnstone added that Drummond's report that ten thousand additional French soldiers were expected to follow was \\"inexcusable\\", as \\"this false information [...] greatly influenced us\\". Despite Charles's orders that he march to England and join the main field army there, Drummond insisted that the Jacobite forces meet in the central Lowlands, citing French instructions that government-held fortresses should be reduced first.Duffy, Christopher, \\"The 45 Campaign\\" in Pollard (ed) (2009) Culloden, Pen & Sword, Kindle edn, loc. 576. Copies of Drummond's written orders do not contain such an instruction, and it is unclear exactly what the French requested of him. In the interim he sent some of his regulars to assist Lewis Gordon against the government's Independent Highland Companies, scattering them at Inverurie in late December. The two Jacobite armies eventually joined up on 4 January, forming a total force of some 9,500 men.Duffy (2009), loc.576 Spey. For the remainder of the campaign Drummond, with the rank of Lieutenant-General, acted as one of the army's brigade commanders alongside his brother James and Lord George Murray.Reid, Stuart (2012) The Scottish Jacobite Army 1745-6, Bloomsbury, p.45 At Falkirk on 17 January he was appointed to command the Jacobite left, with Murray leading the right; his absence on reconnaissance at the start of the action may have impacted on the support available for Murray's attack, leading to mutual recriminations between the two afterwards. Despite this Drummond made a substantial personal contribution during the battle: he took several prisoners with his own hand, had a horse killed under him, and received a musket-shot in the right arm. During March Drummond was tasked with defending the line of the Spey against a government advance, establishing his headquarters at Gordon Castle near Fochabers.Aikman (ed) (2001) No Quarter Given: The Muster Roll of Prince Charles Edward Stuart's Army, N Wilson, p 88 Although personally courageous, Drummond was reputedly hot-tempered, arguing with both Murray and Charles himself. As a long-term exile he was occasionally insensitive to Scottish customs:Tomasson, K. (1958) The Jacobite General. Blackwood, p.178 when retreating through Aberdeen after Stirling, Drummond was said to have suggested hanging some Church of Scotland ministers \\"for examples\\".Blaikie, Walter (1916) Origins of the 'forty-five, and other papers relating to that rising, Scottish History Society, p.140 Johnstone also claimed to be unimpressed with his military abilities, stating he had \\"little knowledge in the art of war [...] so much the more extraordinary that he was a general officer in the service of France\\".Winchester (ed) (1870) pp.100-1 At Culloden Drummond commanded the centre regiments of the Jacobite line; during the battle Andrew Henderson recalled him walking across the front of the Jacobite lines \\"with a Fuzee in his Hand\\" to try and tempt the British troops into opening fire.Henderson, Andrew. (1753) The History of the Rebellion, 1745 and 1746, Millar, Owen, Reeve and Swan, p.326 Following the defeat at Culloden Drummond escaped Scotland on a French ship with several other senior officers, including his brother: James died on 13 May and was buried at sea. John Drummond was accordingly styled as 4th Duke of Perth afterwards, though a government act of attainder deprived him of the Drummond family's Scottish estates. On his arrival in France in June he travelled to Versailles, giving the French court the first reliable account of the defeat at Culloden.Wemyss (2003) p.128 Death Drummond died at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom on 28 September 1747 after falling sick with a fever. He had been Brigadier in command of the picquets in the trenches; shortly before his death he was promoted to the rank of Major-General. He was buried in the chapel of the English convent at Antwerp; the convent buildings were sold in the 1790s and a search in 1844 found his memorial had been lost.Clark (ed) (1851) The House of Lords: cases on appeals and writs of error, claims of peerage, and divorces, during the sessions 1848, 1849 and 1850, vol II, W H Bond, p.876 Successors Drummond had no children, and was succeeded as titular Earl and Duke of Perth by his uncle John, the son of James, first duke, by his second wife. - References Category:1713 births Category:1747 deaths Category:18th-century Scottish people Category:Earls of Perth Category:Place of birth missing Category:Dukes of Perth Category:Scottish Jacobites Category:People of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Category:Scottish expatriates in France Category:French Army officers ","title":"John Drummond, 4th Duke of Perth"},{"id":"33191799","text":"Kariandusi School Trust is a UK registered charity set up in 2003 for the advancement of education amongst children in rural Kenya by addressing the need for the construction of school buildings and the ongoing provision of school facilities and educational materials in and around those schools.

The GCTF‚Äôs mission is to diminish terrorist recruitment and increase countries‚Äô civilian capabilities for dealing with terrorist threats within their borders and regions. Currently co-chaired by Canada and Morocco, the GCTF has 30 founding members. The Forum works with partners around the globe to identify critical civilian needs to effectively counter terrorism, mobilize the necessary expertise and resources to address such needs, and enhance global CT cooperation. One of the key goals of the GCTF is to support and catalyze implementation of the United Nations (UN) Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and the UN‚Äôs CT work more broadly, including the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism that was presented to the UN General Assembly in January 2016. In pursuance of this goal, the GCTF works closely with UN bodies and with other relevant international and regional organizations, to reinforce, complement, and support multilateral CT and Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) efforts. The GCTF‚Äôs Coordinating Committee, which meets twice per year, oversees the activities of the six Working Groups and the Administrative Unit, and provides strategic guidance on how best to address the evolving terrorist threat.

All Working Groups seek to identify relevant civilian counterterrorism challenges and capacity gaps or needs; consider activities to address these gaps or needs; and mobilize political will, financial resources, and expertise to implement those activities. = Countering Violent Extremism = Co-Chaired by the United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom, the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Working Group focuses on diminishing radicalization and recruitment to terrorism through internationally-, regionally-, nationally- and locally owned and relevant approaches to CVE. The Working Group has joined with partners (states and organizations) to promote and advance the understanding of community engagement, community oriented policing, the roles of women and the community in CVE, and the role of religious education in CVE. It is also encouraging the implementation of relevant GCTF documents and tools, through supporting the development of National Action Plans (in line with the vision of the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Plan of Action on Preventing Violent Extremism) and through the promotion of joint initiatives with other GCTF Working Groups, including on strategic communications and de-radicalization and counter- narrative programs in prisons. = Criminal Justice and the Rule of Law = Co-Chaired by Egypt and the United States, the Criminal Justice and Rule of Law (CJ-ROL) Working Group focuses on the critical role played by the criminal justice sector in combating terrorism, and demonstrates the Forum‚Äôs commitment to support rule-of-law based and human rights compliant approaches. Working Group initiatives focus on developing and supporting good practices and capacity building initiatives for an effective and rule of law-based criminal justice sector response to terrorism. = Detention & Reintegration = Co- chaired by Australia and Indonesia, the Detention and Reintegration (DR) Working Group facilitates cooperation, capacity-building, awareness raising, information sharing, marshalling of resources to respond to emerging issues, and the development of good practices to help corrections and counter- terrorism officials integrate prisons into national counter-terrorism arrangements and better manage terrorist detainees. The Working Group focuses on understanding and addressing the issues that arise from the incarceration and eventual release of violent extremists, and the motivations behind violent extremist offenders, which often differs greatly from that of common criminals. The Working Group serves as a platform to discuss possible cooperation among countries on these issues, including strengthening the capacities of prison management systems through technical assistance and developing good practices to guide practitioners and policy-makers. 'If you'd like more information on this subject or the related GCTF documents please visit: www.thegctf.org = Foreign Terrorist Fighters = Co-chaired by Morocco and the Netherlands, the ‚ÄúForeign Terrorist Fighters‚Äù (FTF) Working Group addresses the ongoing and salient challenges presented by the FTF phenomenon. . The Working Group was established following an initiative led by Morocco and the Netherlands. It provides a critical platform for developing practical initiatives to help coordinate and build on the efforts at the national-, regional- and international-levels to stem the flow of FTFs and address the complex issues related to their return. 'If you'd like more information on this subject or the related GCTF documents please visit: www.thegctf.org = Horn of Africa Capacity-Building = Co-chaired by the European Union and Turkey, the Horn of Africa (HOA) Capacity-Building Working Group aims to build capacity to counter terrorism and violent extremism in the region, by identifying and bridging capacity-building gaps. It provides a forum for information exchange, networking, and cooperation among a variety of stakeholders to promote dialogue, understanding, sharing of analysis and lessons learned, and collaborative partnerships in the region and beyond. The Working Group has expanded its focus from anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, to include strengthening rule of law-based CT investigations and prosecutorial capacity, CVE, and the FTF phenomenon. = Sahel Region Capacity-Building = Co-chaired by Algeria and Canada, the Sahel Region Capacity Building (Sahel) Working Group promotes regional and international cooperation and provides a venue for experts to discuss capacity-building gaps specific to the Sahel region and identifying solutions. The Working Group border security, building criminal justice, legal and judicial cooperation, police cooperation, countering the financing of terrorism and countering violent extremism through increased community engagement as the priority areas for the period ahead.  Cross-Cutting Initiatives  The threat from terrorism is complex, dynamic and evolving, and the tools and measures we use to counter and respond to this threat must keep pace. That is why, in addition to the initiatives of the six GCTF Working Groups, the Forum is also focusing on a number of overarching and cross- cutting issues, including: = Border Security Initiative = In light of the challenges posed by porous borders, states recognize the importance of securing these borders and the need for cross-border cooperation that allows inter-agency, neighboring border security agencies and border communities to collaborate with one another in a holistic way. A multilateral, coordinated approach to border management is integral to addressing the myriad of threats and challenges each State faces individually. The Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre (UNCCT) jointly established the Border Security Initiative (BSI), co-led by the United States and Morocco which aims to assist UN Member States‚Äô implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Security Council resolutions including 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 2129 (2013), and 2178 (2014), and to address the overall challenges that permeable borders pose, in particular long remote green border areas between States. The activities held under the auspices of the BSI, which focused on two regions, namely Horn of Africa and the Sahel, provided the opportunity for experts to present lessons learned and effective mechanisms for border security management (BSM) and to identify the good practices in the area of cross-border cooperation and border community engagement. This led to the development of the Good Practices in the Area of Border Security and Management in the Context of Counterterrorism and Stemming the Flow of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, an outcome of this initiative, which will be presented for adoption at the Seventh Ministerial Plenary Meeting in New York in September 2016. These good practices are intended to inform and guide governments as they develop policies, programs, and approaches for effective BSM, cross-border cooperation, and border surveillance in a counterterrorism context. They can also be used to shape bilateral or multilateral technical or other capacity-building assistance provide in these areas. = International Counterterrorism/Countering Violent Extremism Clearinghouse Mechanism = Consistent with the GCTF‚Äôs founding vision to include a civilian-focused, capacity-building coordination and clearinghouse role for the Forum, at the Sixth Ministerial Meeting in September 2015, Turkey and the United States announced the launch of a two- year pilot program for an International Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism Capacity-Building Clearinghouse Mechanism (ICCM).  Partners and outreach  In addition to the contributions of its members, the GCTF‚Äôs strength lies in innovative, flexible partnerships and coordination with non-member states, UN bodies, other international and regional multilateral organizations and fora, and implementing partners. Relevant non- members states and other stakeholders are regularly invited by the relevant GCTF Working Group Co-chairs to participate in Working Group meetings or activities. = Inspired institutions =  GCERF  The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF), based in Geneva, Switzerland, is the first global effort to support local, community-level initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience against violent extremism in states where support is most needed. As a public-private partnership operating at the nexus of security and development, GCERF works with governments, civil society, the private sector, and the international community in beneficiary countries to support national strategies to address the local drivers of violent extremism. Approximately USD 15 million has already been committed to projects in the pilot states Bangladesh, Mali, and Nigeria. In 2016, GCERF has started working in Kenya and Kosovo. GCERF aims to raise more than USD 200 million over the next 10 years to provide grants to local, grass-roots organizations implementing CVE-focused projects. Twelve countries and the EU have already pledged USD 25 million, while other stakeholders have also provided in-kind support. GCERF serves as a platform for Pillar I by addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism More information about GCERF is available on www.gcerf.org.  Hedayah  Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, is a key operational delivery arm for the Forum‚Äôs CVE efforts. It is an essential partner in the development and implementation of the Abu Dhabi Memorandum on Good Practices for Education and Countering Violent Extremism, including through the ongoing GCTF-OIC initiative on CVE and religious education. In addition, Hedayah manages the Catalogue of FTF-related CVE and Returnee Programs under the auspices of the FTF Working Group, which serves as a living resource for interested states. Hedayah serves as a platform for Pillar I of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.  International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ)  The International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ), based in Valletta, Malta, has provided invaluable support to the GCTF, and continues to do so through the development and implementation of GCTF good practices and memoranda and other initiatives with criminal justice practitioners and experts, including support of the Neuch√¢tel Memorandum on Good Practices for Juvenile Justice in a Counterterrorism Context and the Recommendations Relating to Contributions by Parliamentarians in Developing an Effective Response to Terrorism. In 2016, the IIJ continued to promote implementation of the GCTF good practices, including training judges and prosecutors on how to address terrorism-related activities within a rule of law framework. The IIJ supports Pillar IV of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by developing curricula that emphasize respect for human rights and the rule of law as the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism.

It is a sequel to the 1995 film The Snow Queen and has some of the voice cast changed, including Julia McKenzie replacing Helen Mirren as the titular role of the Snow Queen. The animation production was done overseas at Fil-Cartoons in Manila, Philippines, formerly owned by American studio Hanna- Barbera. Vanquished in the first film, the evil Snow Queen returns to life, setting out to seek revenge on those who ruined her plans to freeze and rule the world. It is up to young Ellie and her best friends to stop her again. Plot The plot is picking up where the previous film left off. With the evil Snow Queen having been defeated, Dimly the flying reindeer returned to the village with Ellie, her brother Tom, and Peeps the sparrow. By now it is almost spring. Back at the Snow Queen's palace, her now uncontrolled three trolls, Eric, Baggy and Wardrobe, prepare for Dimly to take Freda back to the flying school and return for the trolls. As the trolls try to figure out where to go, the Queen's bats take her magic staff and place it in her hand, setting her free from her frozen form moments after Dimly returns. The furious Queen decides to kidnap Dimly so Ellie will come to her and she can get her revenge. She moves with Dimly and the trolls to the South Pole, as it is now too warm in the North Pole. The Snow Queen contacts Ellie, telling her that she has captured Dimly and daring her to rescue him. Ellie does not know where the Queen is now, so Peeps takes her to Brenda, a bird that is said to know everything. Meanwhile, the Queen reaches her palace set on a frozen volcano and locks Dimly away in a cell next to her ferocious reindeer, which attempt to break into his cell and eat him. Brenda takes Ellie and Peeps toward the South Pole. They stop at a restaurant for food, where the proprietor (a greedy humanoid pig) and her minions capture Brenda and try to cook her to serve as food. Ellie and Peeps stop them and escape, destroying the restaurant. The Snow Queen begins work on the final part of her plan, creating a flying magic monster she names Iceosaurus. Meanwhile, Ellie falls asleep and she and Peeps fall off Brenda and into the ocean, where they are picked up by a humanoid walrus, Clive and his partner Rowena, on a ship named the S.S. Quagmire. When Ellie and Peeps describe how they are on their way to the Queen's palace, they realize that she set the whole thing up to lure Ellie there. Clive and Rowena are revealed to be bounty hunters who plan to give Ellie to the Queen for a big reward, and imprison her and Peeps. When Brenda realizes that they have fallen off, she comes back and rescues them. Brenda, Ellie, and Peeps arrive at the South Pole, but Iceosaurus freezes Brenda. Ellie and Peeps discover a magic talisman that turns into a salt shaker which Ellie uses to unfreeze Brenda. Brenda separates from Ellie to find a high place to take off. Ellie and Peeps encounter Pearl and Elspeth, two humanoid penguins who clean the palace for the Snow Queen, and Ellie traps them inside a bubble using the device. They find Dimly and release him from his cell by turning the device into a key, and locking the Queen's reindeer inside. The group attempts to escape, but Dimly is too weak to fly at the moment. The Queen and Iceosaurus attack them, but Freda's device turns into a kind of shield that Ellie uses to deflect the ice beams the Queen shoots at her, causing one to hit Iceosaurus. It falls and crashes into the ground, creating a massive volcanic eruption. Brenda escapes the flood of lava and gets Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly to safety. The panicked Queen attempts to flee on feet, but is unable to escape her crumbling palace and falls down into the lava. As Brenda takes Ellie, Peeps, and Dimly back home, Eric, Baggy, Wardrobe, Pearl, and Elspeth watch as the Snow Queen's castle is destroyed, and walk off once the eruption is over. The final scene shows the Queen drifting through the river of molten magma, her body seemingly intact but now turned to stone, and still holding her magic staff. As at the end of the first film, her eyes glow ominously before the credits roll.

When Parliament re-convened in September 2011, the Minister of Justice introduced the Safe Streets and Communities Act, an omnibus bill of nine separate measures. The measures include replacing the pardon system with 'record suspensions', mandatory minimum sentences for certain sexual offences and mandatory minimum penalties for certain drug offences, making it illegal to make sexually explicit information available to a child, increasing prison sentences for marijuana offences, reducing the ability of judges to sentence certain offenders to house arrest, allowing immigration officers to deny work permits to foreigners who are at risk of being sexually exploited, and enabling Canadians to sue state sponsors of terrorism for losses due to an act of terrorism. A particularly contentious aspect of the bill was the proposed enhancement of powers given to government authorities to monitor online communications, but this proposal was abandoned after an online petition opposing those measures garnered over 70,000 signatures. One of the smaller bills incorporated into this legislation was Bill C-23B, formerly called \\"Eliminating Pardons for Serious Offences.\\" This section made significant changes to the country's pardon laws. Part 3 of the bill replaced the term \\"pardon\\" with \\"Record Suspension\\" and eliminated pardons for those with Schedule 1 criminal offences on their record or those with more than three offences each carrying a sentence of two years or more. The bill caused much controversy. While the Canadian Police Association said the bill would work towards keeping communities more safe, it added it was concerned about the cost. The Quebec government said it would refuse to pay for the bill, calling it a short-term \\"Band-Aid solution.\\" The Ontario government would also refuse to pay. Texan conservatives Judge John Creuzot, Republican Representative Jerry Madden, and Marc Levin also spoke out against the bill; according to Madden, \\"It's a very expensive thing to build new prisons and, if you build them, I guarantee you they will come. They'll be filled, OK? Because people will send them there.\\" References External links *Safe Streets and Communities Act from the Parliament of Canada website *LegalEase podcast discusses the Conservatives' Omnibus Safe Streets and Communities Act from a legal perspective Category:Canadian federal legislation Category:41st Canadian Parliament Category:2012 in Canadian law Category:Canadian criminal law Category:Omnibus legislation ","title":"Safe Streets and Communities Act"},{"id":"33192098","text":"FML Stephan Maria Mayerhoffer von Vedropolje Alt√°bornagy (FML) B√©la Mikl√≥s Lieutenant field marshal, also frequently historically field marshal lieutenant (, formerly Feldmarschallleutnant, historically also Feldmarschall- Lieutenant and, in official Imperial and Royal Austrian army documents from 1867 always Feldmarschalleutnant, abbreviated FML), was a senior army rank in certain European armies of the 17th to 20th centuries. It emerged as the rank of field marshal () came to be used for the highest army commander in the 17th century (having originally been the equivalent of a cavalry colonelDelbr√ºck, Hans. The Dawn of Modern Warfare. Lincoln, USA: University of Nebraska, 1985. p. 257). In German-speaking countries the commander-in-chief usually appointed an \\"under marshal\\" (Untermarschall) or \\"lieutenant field marshal\\" to support and represent the field marshal. Amongst his functions as the personal deputy to the field marshal, were the supervision of supply depots and routes, and inspection of the guards.  Development  The rank was used by the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire from the 17th century until 1806. It was also introduced to the Army of the Austrian Empire in the period 1804 to 1866, and the Austro-Hungarian Army from 1867 to 1918, where it was the second highest general rank after the various heads of arm - the general of infantry, general of cavalry and general of artillery - until the introduction of the rank of colonel general in 1915. On the re-introduction of the rank of field marshal, it fell back to third place in terms of seniority. Prince Montecuccoli, a field marshal himself in the Habsburg army gives the order of precedence in the Imperial Army as follows:Montecuccoli, Prince Raimondo. Writings: Military Writings, 2:210. Revised by Captain Alois Veltm, Vienna and Leipzig, 1899. Austrian State Archives. * Feldhauptmann (commander-in-chief) * General- Lieutenant or Feldhauptmann Lieutenant (lieutenant general) * *Feldmarschall (field marshal) *General der Kavallerie and General der Artillerie (general of cavalry and general of artillery) *Felmarschall-Lieutenant (field marshal lieutenant) *General-Feldwachtmeister (major general) In 1789, for example, the Emperor conferred the rank of \\"Lieutenant Field Marshal on the Major Generals Count de Harrach, Baron d'Alvinzi, Prince Christian de Waldeck, Baron de Levenehr and Baron de Wallisch...\\"The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol 65., London, 1789, p. 558. Subsequently, the order of precedence of general ranks in the Austro-Hungarian Army was as follows: *Feldmarschall - T√°rbornagy (field marshal) *Generaloberst - Vez√©rezredes, introduced in 1915 (colonel general) *General der Infanterie - Gyalogs√°gi T√°bornok, General der Kavallerie - Lovass√°gi T√°bornok and Feldzeugmeister - T√°borszernagy (general of infantry, general of cavalry and general of artillery) *Feldmarschall-Leutnant \\\\- Alt√°bornagy (field marshal lieutenant) *Generalmajor - Vez√©r≈ërnagy (major general) At that time, a field marshal lieutenant of the k.u.k. Army was equivalent to the Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) of the Prussian Army (today comparable to an OF7, major general or two-star rank). The normal assignment of a lieutenant field marshal was command of a division-sized formation. He was addressed by the honorific title of \\"excellency\\". In Austria the rank continued to be used after 1918 by the commander-in-chief (FML Adolf von Boog) of the so-called Volkswehr (People's Defence) until 1919. However, the Bundesheer of the First Republic adopted the designation, structure and sequence of the German ranks in 1920. In 1933, following national tradition, Austrian ranks, insignia and uniforms were reintroduced, including lieutenant field marshal. These ranks remained in use until the Anschluss in 1938. The equivalent of lieutenant field marshal in the Hungarian Army was the rank of alt√°bornagy. Today it is still in use as NATO OF-8, three-star rank corresponding to lieutenant general in English-speaking armed forces.

He studied at the Church of the East School in Nineveh (Mosul) under the tutelage of Yousip DeKelaita. He studied both church history and the Aramaic language.  Service to the Church  Toma was ordained as a deacon at a young age in 1956. Not long after the arrival of Mar Thoma Darmo to Baghdad, Iraq in September 1968, Toma was elevated to the rank of priest and assigned as a parish priest in Basra, Iraq. After the death of Mar Thoma Darmo in September 1969, Mar Narsai, alongside Mar Toma Gewargis, were elected to be ordained as metropolitans in the Ancient Church of the East. Both ordinations were conducted on 5 December 1969 by Mar Addai II, the Metropolitan of Iraq and Locum tenens of the Ancient Church of the East at the time. Mar Narsai, together with Metropolitan of Nineveh, Mar Toma Giwargis, consecrated Mar Addai II as Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East. The ordination took place on February 20, 1972 in Baghdad, Iraq. During his tenure, Mar Narsai placed an emphasis on education.

The episode depicts the aftermath of the third season finale in which Peter Bishop disappears from his timeline. In the new, altered timeline, Olivia Dunham is joined by FBI agent Lincoln Lee after the latter's partner is murdered. The two work to investigate his death, which revolves around shape-shifting technology. The episode was co-written by J.H. Wyman, Jeff Pinkner, and Akiva Goldsman. Joe Chappelle directed the installment. Wyman and Pinkner approached it as a new pilot and used the character of Lee to help introduce viewers to the series. As a result of Lee's inclusion, \\"Neither Here nor There\\" is the first episode to introduce his portrayer Seth Gabel, formerly a recurring actor, as a main cast member. Joe Flanigan guest-starred as his partner, Robert Danzig. The episode is also the first to briefly feature recurring actress Michelle Krusiec as Nadine Park. \\"Neither Here nor There\\" was originally broadcast on September 23, 2011 on the Fox network to an estimated 3.5 million viewers. It scored a 1.5/5 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49. Critical reception towards the episode was mixed, with several praising its special effects and Anna Torv's acting but criticizing elements of its story. Plot At the end of \\"The Day We Died\\", Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) uses the Machine to create a \\"bridge\\" between the prime and parallel universe allowing the two sides to work together to resolve the instabilities in both universes; but in doing so, Peter vanishes. Because of this, Observer September (Michael Cerveris) says Peter never existed. Despite this, the Observers are aware of changes in the original timeline, with echoes of Peter appearing. December (Eugene Lipinski) charges September with assuring that the last memories of Peter are wiped out. Both universes have created a secure airlock-like system around the shared room housing the Machine within the bridge. At the start of the episode, the two Olivias (Anna Torv), still somewhat distrusting of the other, help to share relevant Fringe files between the two universes. FBI agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and his partner of five years, Robert Danzig (Joe Flanigan), are pursuing an arms dealer; while Lee apprehends the man, his partner is killed by a second, mysterious man with translucent skin and seemingly superhuman abilities. The skin of Danzig's body also becomes translucent after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing their intentions. Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about the appearance of the killer, but are unable to identify him by name. Olivia agrees to bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows him that there have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious connection or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar. In examining the bodies, Walter discovers a bio-mechanical module similar to those they had previously seen in the shapeshifters that Walternate used. Olivia and Lincoln take the module to the Machine room. As Lincoln is stunned by the technology, Olivia gives the module to Fauxlivia, who promises to take it to Walternate to investigate. During the episode, Walter is shown to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia arranged his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled to wipe out the remains of Peter's existence. But at the last moment September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified. Production The episode was co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and consulting producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode \\"like a new pilot\\" to draw in viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee as a tool to acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, \\"You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you‚Äôve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while.\\" The showrunners had the episode center around the idea that \\"Peter no longer exists\\", and intended it to \\"set up the season arc from numerous characters' perspectives\\" to show viewers what to expect from the season. When discussing the season's arc, Fox and Warner Brothers wished to have Peter return as soon as possible, as they knew he was popular with fans. Pinkner and Wyman responded that to \\"really establish his absence [it] will take a little while\\", but knew that a longer wait would lead to audience frustration. The fourth season premiere was initially called \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", also the name of a song by rock band U2. The episode's opening credits featured a new amber-tinted sequence, which listed new fringe science terms like \\"Psychometry\\", \\"Gravitons\\", and \\"Existence\\". Pinkner said the new color of the credits \\"clearly [indicates] a universe without Peter in it.\\" \\"Neither Here nor There\\" marked the first appearance of recurring guest actress Michelle Krusiec. Her casting was confirmed in July 2011. The episode also featured a one-time guest appearance by actor Joe Flanigan, who played Lee's partner Robert Danzig. Flanigan shot his scenes in July 2011. In popular culture The scene in the diner where the Observers discuss Peter's existence featured \\"California Dreamin'\\" by vocal group The Mamas & the Papas. Other songs featured in the episode included \\"Rockin' Robin\\" by Bobby Day and \\"Cinderella in the Palace\\" by Sergei Prokofiev, the latter performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine. Walter later quotes a line from the 1963 John le Carr√© novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. Reception =Ratings= \\"Neither Here nor There\\" originally broadcast in the United States on September 23, 2011 to an estimated 3.5 million viewers. It scored a 1.5/5 ratings share among viewers 18‚Äì49, meaning that it was seen by 1.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. This ratings share was up 25 percent from the third season finale but down 21 percent from the season's premiere. Despite its low ratings, the episode was the highest-rated Friday premiere on Fox in six years. Among total viewers it came in fourth for the night but finished third among adults. =Reviews= Among the main cast members, Anna Torv received the most praise from television critics. Writing for The Onions The A.V. Club, Noel Murray gave the episode a \\"B\\", remarking that he \\"enjoyed the episode overall‚Äîlargely because it's just such a treat to have be back in this world with these people‚ÄîI'm not sure it was wholly successful in its attempt to play by the old rules.\\" He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia, the episode \\"settles into a fairly typical\\" Fringe formula involving a \\"villain of the week\\" and a freakish event. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times praised Anna Torv's two performances and believed \\"the containment built around 'the Machine'\\" may \\"have been my favorite part of the episode.\\" Den of Geek selected the episode's special effects as a positive element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. \\"As Fringe goes\\", the website explained, \\"this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on.\\" IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, \\"It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, has plenty of action, and the actors are great as usual. But it just doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does it strike me as a fantastic new direction for the season.\\" Richard Edwards of SFX gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing that it \\"chooses to mostly ignore exploring the implications [of Peter's disappearance] on the overall story arc in favour of a fairly run-of-the-mill (by Fringe standards, at least) case of the week. Even the potentially scintillating scenes between the alternate incarnations of the characters fail to materialise, aside from a couple of stilted encounters between the two Olivias.\\" Edwards did however praise the premiere for its special effects, and for doing an effective job presenting the characteristics of a world without Peter, especially highlighting Lincoln's newcomer role as a lens for the audience.

The former mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, proposed to provide a limited free meal service to the 30% of the impoverished children in Seoul, but the Democratic Party proposed to make the free meal service to every child in Seoul starting from younger elementary school children and gradually to middle school children. This has become the cause of Oh Se-hoon's action to make the final decision of the policy through a referendum. The referendum was later rejected due to the low voter turnout of 25.7%, significantly lower than the required turnout of 33.3%. The low voting rate contributed Oh Se-hoon's resignation from the mayoralty of Seoul. Issues * The Democratic Party called the referendum and Oh Se-hoon's action unjust because the free school lunch in Seoul for a year costs 69.5 billion won while the referendum costs around 12 billion won. * The Grand National Party, Oh Se-hoon's political party of affiliation, considered Oh's defeat in a different perspective.

It was formerly considered highly diverse, containing around 84 to 96 valid species, but taxonomic revision resulted in a major change in the contents of the genus, and today it is recognised as containing just four species. Description Hylarana are small to large-sized frogs. Males have an average snout-vent length of , while females range from . The nares (nostrils) are oval in shape and covered by a flap of skin. The tympanum is visible but is not covered by a supratympanic fold. Vomerine teeth and a pineal ocellus (parietal eye) are present. The toes are webbed, but the fingers are not. Distribution Former members of the genus Hylarana ranged from Sri Lanka to the Western Ghats of India, through Nepal and southern China and Taiwan, down to Southeast Asia to the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and tropical Africa. Following taxonomic revisions, the genus is actually restricted to Southern and southeast Asia. Taxonomy Hylarana belongs to the subfamily Raninae of the true frog family Ranidae. The generic name Hylarana derives from New Latin hyle (\\"wood\\" or \\"forest\\") and rana (\\"frog\\"). Hylarana was previously considered to be a subgenus of the genus Rana. It was recognized as a distinct genus in 2005. Several genera were further split from Hylarana in 2006, and then treated again as junior synonyms of Hylarana. In 2015, Oliver et al. performed a major taxonomic re-assessment of Hylarana. Their taxonomic reassessment left just four of the former 80‚Äì100 species within the genus Hylarana sensu stricto. The rest were transferred to Abavorana, Amnirana, Chalcorana, Humerana, Hydrophylax, Indosylvirana, Papurana, Pulchrana, and Sylvirana. =Species= Formerly, the genus consisted of around 84 to 96 valid species. Following a major re- classification, only four species are now recognised in the genus Hylarana: *Hylarana erythraea (Schlegel, 1837) \\\\- common green frog, green paddy frog, leaf frog, or red-eared frog *Hylarana macrodactyla G√ºnther, 1858 \\\\- Guangdong frog, three-striped grass frog, or marbled slender frog *Hylarana taipehensis (Van Denburgh, 1909) \\\\- two-striped grass frog *Hylarana tytleri Theobald, 1868 Following this revision, the genus assignment of several Hylarana species is now uncertain: *\\"Hylarana\\" attigua (Inger, Orlov, and Darevsky, 1999) *\\"Hylarana\\" celebensis (Peters, 1872) *\\"Hylarana\\" chitwanensis (Das, 1998) *\\"Hylarana\\" garoensis (Boulenger, 1920) *\\"Hylarana\\" lateralis (Boulenger, 1887) *\\"Hylarana\\" latouchii (Boulenger, 1899) *\\"Hylarana\\" margariana Anderson, 1879 *\\"Hylarana\\" montivaga (Smith, 1921) *\\"Hylarana\\" persimilis (Van Kampen, 1923) See also *Rana References Category:Amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of Asia Category:True frogs Category:Taxa named by Johann Jakob von Tschudi ","title":"Hylarana"},{"id":"33192277","text":"Heilan Equestrian Club () is an equestrian club located in Xinqiao Town, Jiangyin City in Jiangsu, China.

She received widespread acclaim for her poignant intimacy and social commentary. The weight of her themes stands in powerful contrast to her particular aesthetic and choice of delicate materials.  Early life and education  ≈†ejla Kameriƒá was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a child she lived in Dubai where her father was working for several years as a volleyball coach. Her family returned to Sarajevo in the wake of Yugoslav wars. When the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina started ≈†ejla Kameriƒá was just 16 years old with a successful career as a model for local and international fashion magazines and brands. She continued her modeling career during the early years of war. During the Siege of Sarajevo, she graduated from the High School for Applied Arts and enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts Sarajevo, graduating from the Graphic Design department after the war. Between 1994 and 1997, she worked with the design group Trio, group of young artists who (amongst other outstanding projects) designed a series of postcards Greetings from Sarajevo (1993) in order to draw international attention to the atrocious situation in the besieged Sarajevo. In 1997, she started to exhibit regularly in Sarajevo and internationally. During this period and until 2000, she was the art director of the advertising agency Fabrika. Since 2003 she was a member of the European Cultural Parliament. She was awarded with DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program Fellowship in 2007 and continued to live and work in Berlin as a freelance artist. In 2011, Kameriƒá received The ECF Routes Princess Margriet Award for Cultural Diversity. Today she lives and works between Sarajevo and Berlin.  Artistic practice  ≈†ejla Kameriƒá works with various media such as film, photography, objects or drawings. The all-pervading element in her work are her ‚Äì often uneasy ‚Äì memories. She is using them as a power source by sharpening the focus of the present through the burden past. Based on her own experiences, memories and dreams, her work takes us to glocal spaces of displacement and discrimination, insisting that the delicate and the sublime are not pushed aside by catastrophe or hardship. Rather, they exist simultaneously, revealing a complex, psychogeographic landscape and the tenacity of the human spirit. The sadness and beauty, the hope and pain that emerge are part of the stories we share. Dunja Bla≈æeviƒá in the catalogue of the exhibition ‚ÄúIn the Gorges of the Balkans‚Äù, Fridericianum Museum, Kassel, Germany, 2003 wrote: \\"What makes ≈†ejla and the entire group of ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù artists essentially different from other members of their generation is the meaning inherent in their works, as opposed to the materials they use. Furthermore, in pursuing her work without worrying about what art really is or isn't, she proves herself a member of that generation born in the age of mass-media, in which the main references are the media and the reality around them, and not the history of art.\\"  Exhibitions and screenings  In 1997, Kameriƒá exhibited her work for the first time at the annual exhibition organized by SCCA - Sarajevo Center for Contemporary Art and curated by its director and renown art historian Dunja Bla≈æeviƒá. In the following years, Kameriƒá worked closely with Bla≈æeviƒá and continued to collaborate with SCCA. In this period Kameriƒá started to exhibit internationally. In 2000, she was invited to Manifesta III (entitled Borderline Syndrom) in Ljubljana, Slovenia. For this occasion, she made the installation EU/Others which received international acclaim and later became part of the TATE Modern collection. Since then Kameriƒá has done numerous installations and interventions in public space: Closing The Border (2002); Bosnian Girl (2003); Pink Line vs. Green Line (2006); Ab uno disce omnes (2015), BFF (2015); SUMMERISNOTOVER (2014‚Äì2020).

Analysis of individual works  = EU/Others = ≈†ejla Kameriƒá, EU/Others, 2000. Installation view at Manifesta III, Triple Bridge, Ljubljana, Slovenia. EU/Others is an installation in public space conceived for the exhibition ‚ÄòBorderless Syndrome‚Äô Manifesta 3 - the European Biennial of Contemporary Art, held in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2000. The exhibition was curated by Francesco Bonami (Chicago, Turin), Ole Bouman (Rotterdam), Maria Hlavajov√° (Amsterdam, Bratislava) and Kathrin Rhomberg (Vienna). The public installation consisting of two double-sided light-boxes with inscription EU citizens on one side and Others on the other, challenged pedestrians as they crossed the famous triple bridges of Tromostovje in the center of Ljubljana. Signs above the walkway replicated the actual border control division of travelers. If one was to look back, however, they would realize the signs were double-sided, and any chosen path was absurdly opposite in the other direction. During these early years of the European Union integration process, two different signs were placed at the border crossings of member countries: EU Citizens and Others. At the time, Slovenia was not yet a member of the EU but was applying the same border control segregation rules. A few years later, the Others signs were replaced with the more politically correct one of non-EU citizens and Slovenia became a full EU member. The work EU/Others received critical acclaim due to its pertinent concept and lucid approach. The work was later exhibited worldwide, among others, in The Philips Collection (in partnership with the New Museum, New York), Washington DC; Das Haus der Geschichte √ñsterreich/The House of Austrian History in Vienna; ARTER, Istanbul and Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt/University of Klagenfurt. Artist Statement \\"As a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I can freely (visa-free) enter just a few countries in the world. When I wish to enter Slovenia, I need a visa which I can get only if I am on a business trip or if a friend invites me for a visit. At the Slovenian border, I enter Slovenia through an entrance with the sign OTHERS. When Slovenians are traveling to European countries, they also use the ‚ÄúOTHERS‚Äù entrance at a border crossing. Who are those ‚ÄúOTHERS‚Äù? What am I doing at the European Biennial of Contemporary Art (in Ljubljana??) as an ‚ÄúOTHER‚Äù? Borders are not just in our heads, they are FACTS. There is an ideal site for my work in Ljubljana; it is Tromostovlje, The Three Bridges in the center of the town. I would like to put signs for the European Union (EU) and OTHERS on the bridges. In such a way, casual passersby who are crossing the bridges will be in the same situation as those who are crossing real country borders. Both will be divided into those who are belonging to the EU and those who are OTHERS. Also, to underline this paradox, even more, I will put different signs on different sides of the bridge, so coming from different directions one will be a ‚Äúmember‚Äù of the EU or an OTHER. The reality that I am facing (together with many other OTHERS) will be moved from the border to the center of Ljubljana. ‚ÄúFree world, Europe without boundaries‚Ä¶‚Äù. IS THE BORDER THE PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD FIND OUT WHO WE REALLY ARE? Do the Slovenians (pedestrians) know who they are?...\\" Sarajevo, 1999 ≈†ejla Kameriƒá (from an email to manifesta III curatorial team) = Bosnian Girl = ≈†ejla Kameriƒá, Bosnian Girl, 2003, installation view at 4. Berliner Herbstsalon, Maxim Gorki Theatre, Berlin, October‚ÄìNovember 2019Bosnian Girl is an art work that started in 2003 as a public project consisting of postcards, posters, billboards, that is exhibited either as an intervention into public space or as a black and white photograph in various dimensions. It was done in collaboration with photographer Tarik Samarah. Denigrating phrases about Bosnian women are superimposed over a black and white photograph of the artist staring straight at the viewer. Taken from graffiti written by an unknown Dutch soldier in 1994/5, a member of the Royal Netherlands Army who, as part of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992‚Äì95, were responsible for protecting the Srebrenica safe area. The artist's gaze is unflinching, direct and challenges not just the words pushed onto her, and all Bosnian women, but invites us to see their new form of identity ‚Äì where victimhood and prejudice, the past and the future are intertwined in co- existing opposition. Originally a series of posters publicly displayed on the 2003 anniversary of the Srebenica genocide, this work has become iconic of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, a direct confrontation of war crimes committed against women and the prejudices that came during and after it. Part of the multiple permanent exhibitions and museum collections, Bosnian Girl is also on view as part of the permanent exhibition in the Memorial Centre Potoƒçari, Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. = 1395 Days without Red = ≈†ejla Kameriƒá, 1395 Days Without Red, 2011. Still Frame.1395 Days without Red was conceived, developed and filmed as a collaborative film project by ≈†ejla Kameriƒá and Anri Sala in collaboration with Ari Benjamin Meyers and produced by ArtAngel, London and SCCA/Pro.ba, Sarajevo. ≈†ejla Kameriƒá's film draws on the experience of the siege of Sarajevo and the trauma of the besieged citizens as they made their way through the city. The title refers to the common anecdotal notion during the siege that Sarajevians should not wear bright colours that could attract the snipers‚Äô attention. The woman, played by Spanish actress Maribel Verdu, is reliving the experience of the trauma of the siege. It is her individual journey in the collective memory of the city. Throughout the siege, the Sarajevo Symphony Orchestra continued to play. In the film, the orchestra rehearses Tchaikovsky‚Äôs 6th symphony, the Pathetique. The musicians stop and start, repeating different sections of the symphony, just as the woman stops and starts in the city. Hearing the music in her head, she finds the courage to carry on.

Raja participated at the annual Esala procession in Kandy for around 50 years and was the sacred casket bearer of the final Randoli perehera for 37 years. He was one of the most celebrated elephants in Asia during his lifetime, and was world famous for his noble behavior. On 20 August 1986 former Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene declared Raja as a national treasure, in recognition of his valuable services to the religion and culture of Sri Lanka. Early years It is believed that Raja was born in the jungles of Eravur in Batticaloa District circa 1913. He was captured by a group of men headed by Umaru Lebbe Panikkar in November 1925. Panikkar is a name given to the men who mastered capturing elephants in the eastern parts of the country. The young elephant Raja had been purchased by Tikiribanda Mampitiya Disawe of Giragama Walauwa in Kandy for 3300 rupees, a huge sum at that time, along with another young elephant named Skanda. With a permit issued by the British government, both the elephants were brought by train to the Kadugannawa railway station and then to the Giragama Walauwa on 11 December 1925. Arambegama Kirihamy was appointed as the mahout of the young elephants. He attached the young elephants to the female elephant he was looking after, who became the foster mother of young elephants. When the two elephants were around 24 years old, they were ceremonially gifted to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. A deed of transfer was drawn up and gifted to the Diyawadana Nilame by Mampitiya Dissawa on 22 August 1937. The Diyawadana Nilame of the Temple of the Tooth, at that time was T. B.Ratwatte. Authorities of Sri Dalada Maligawa were happy about this new elephant who not only had all the physical requirements, but also showed much promise. Thereafter both Raja and Skanda were trained for the responsibilities of the temple elephants and were given the experience of participating in the procession, in the same year. Noble tusker Diyawadana Nilame Neranjan Wijeyeratne with the Sri Dalada Maligawa elephants Raja, Skanda, Jaya Raja & a few more Raja possessed the rare Maha Gaja Lakshana physical characteristics that put him in the aristocratic caste of Sri Lankan elephants, Chaddhantha. After observing the great physical characteristics of the elephant and his obedient behavior, Raja was given the responsibility of carrying the sacred casket at the Esala Perahehra in 1950. Raja by then, had been fully trained and satisfied the authorities about its capabilities. He fulfilled his duties satisfactorily during the initial years, which cemented his place as the chief elephant of the procession for years to come. Raja never had any problems with his mahouts and was very obedient to them. He always respected Buddhist priests and also liked to be in the premises of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. right Most of the times Raja carried the sacred casket at the annual perahera in Kandy flanked by Skanda and another tusker elephant. Sometimes Skanda too carried the casket, but Raja was the casket bearer of the important final Randoli perehera. Even after the demise of Skanda, the fellow tusker elephant in 1986, Raja continued his responsibilities as the chief tusker of the Esala procession in 1987. After serving Buddhist processions for about 50 years, Raja died in July 1988 due to an illness and his death prompted the government to order a day of national mourning in Sri Lanka. A postage stamp was issued in its memory on 12 December 1989, and also the 1,000 Rupee bill, with Raja and the Muslim trainer Umar Lebbe Panicker from Eravur in Batticola. Raja's stuffed remains are presently kept in a special museum within the grounds of the Temple of the Tooth.

After passing out in Pat O'Connell's bar, he is taken home by his friend, police lieutenant Spencer, to his sister Penny, who is romantically involved with Spence. Penny has a tip on a story that could change her brother's life, but will reveal it only on the condition that Paul can go 24 hours without drinking. Hungover and shaking, Paul tries. He needs to be sober and alert at 7 p.m. when a fugitive criminal, Dutch Hayden, is supposed to show up at a restaurant. Spence has information that Hayden has undergone plastic surgery to alter his appearance and is about to leave the country. Paul makes it on time, but in rocky shape. An accident causes his clothing to be soaked in liquor. Hayden arrives with his stripper girlfriend, Flo Knapp, but just as Spencer's men shoot him dead, Paul spots the real Hayden, whose face has not been changed at all. It's a set-up. Every attempt made by Paul to persuade Spencer and Penny of the mistake goes for naught because they are certain that he was drunk. When he sets about proving Hayden is alive, Flo takes him captive at gunpoint. Only in the end does Spence realize that Paul was right all along.

She was the daughter of King Stephen Uro≈° III Deƒçanski of Serbia and her eldest half-brother was Serbian emperor, Stephen Uro≈° IV Du≈°an. She was the mother of two sons, Constantine Draga≈° and Jovan Draga≈°, and one daughter. She later became a nun adopting the name Evdokija (–ï–≤–¥–æ–∫–∏—ò–∞, gr.

It is found in woodlands in Europe and North America. Taxonomy The species was originally described as Agaricus portentosus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, before being placed in the genus Tricholoma by Lucien Qu√©let in 1872. At least three varieties have been described: var. album has an all white cap, var. lugdunense has a paler cap, and var. boutevillei has a very dark cap and is the form which grows with oak and beech. Description left It is a large, imposing mushroom, with a convex cap in diameter with a boss. The cap is sticky when wet and has an irregularly lobed margin. It is dark grey in colour with darker grey to blackish streaks perpendicular to the margins. The grey colour fades towards the margins and may be tinged with yellow or purple. The crowded adnate gills are white, and the solid stipe is white with a yellow tinge at the top. It measures high and wide. The spore print is white. It has a farinaceous smell and taste. Older specimens are often eaten by slugs, and the stem is recommended to be removed before cooking. It can be pickled. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies appear in late autumn in coniferous woodland in Europe and North America. Ectomycorrhizal, it is most commonly associated with Pinus sylvestris, but also sometimes oak (Quercus) or beech (Fagus) on sandy soils. It has been declining since the 1980s in the Netherlands and is now rare there, and uncommon in Britain but is common in France where it is sometime seen in wild mushroom markets. It is common in Estonia. Generally highly regarded as an edible mushroom, it is not recommended by some for its similarity to hazardous species. The inedible Tricholoma virgatum has a silvery-grey cap and grows in mixed woodland, and smells of damp earth and has a bitter taste. The poisonous Tricholoma pardinum has prominent grey scales giving the cap a shaggy or striped appearance.

Amarnath Ganguly is a party leader and wants to stage his own attempted assassination to garner the sympathy vote in the upcoming election. His colleague Shubhankar Banerjee (Biplab Chatterjee) hooks him up with Raja. Ganguly is killed by someone else. Police immediately surround the skyscraper. Raja is about the exit the building when there is a car accident with his car. Raja assumes that Joy has died in the accident. Raja goes to the top of the building with the police in pursuit. A passing train offers Raja an escape with a rope to land on the train. Raja meets Shibu (Atanu Mukherjee) who reveals that he ran away from his village, Ganganagar, when he was young; he is now returning to his village. The police site Raja but shoot Shibu. Raja escapes to Ganganagar. Shibhu's family believes Raja to be their son and accept him. A CBI officer, Salim Ali Khan (Sharad Kapoor) is investigating Ganguly's murder, believes that Raja is responsible, and comes across the Raja/Shibu connection. He tries getting \\"Raja's\\" fingerprints but is outsmarted. Clues implicate Joy. There is in Ganganagar a wedding of \\"Shibu's\\" niece, the CBI come to believe there has been a Raja/Shibu change, and Raga is a murder suspect. Raja flees, the CBI leave, and he returns to explain what is going on. The family shows no interest in helping Raja to find the real assassin but grandfather (Biswajit Chakraborty) gives Raja a gun. Raja calls Shubhankar Banerjee and demands to know who killed Ganguly. Banerjee refuses but Raja tells him that their conversation has been recorded, and Banerjee reveals everything. Joy killed Ganguly for Rs. 20 million. He faked his death by sending a drunkard in the car at the time of the accident. Raja leaves for the old church, where Joy is. Raja and Joy meet and Raja has the gun loaded before Joy. But the same policemen who killed Shibu barge in. Raja kills them all, including Joy. Raja gives the recording to the CBI officer. The CBI officer goes directly to Banerjee's office, tells him that he will hand him over to the police, and Banerjee tells him that he has no concrete evidence. The CBI officer reveals the recording is evidence enough for Ganguly's hot headed son, who has vowed vengeance for his father's death. Trapped without any recourse, Banerjee commits suicide. Raja released Shibu's ashes and the CBI officer lets him go to Shibu's family, where he stays forever.

The Times, Wednesday, August 24, 1955, Issue 53307, p.13. of Luton, England, to its automotive power steering system. Initially Hydrosteer manufactured the Ross-Link system for commercial vehicles from 1953 under licence from Ross Gear and Tool of U.S.A.Power Steering Gives Finger-tip Control. Commercial Motor, 4 September 1953. page 39. accessed 1 December 2019 Their own product available from 1961 was based on a cam and peg system and was characterised by its fully integrated design and variable steering ratio. This configuration provided automotive manufacturers with a fairly simple design modification to provide a power steering option for cars fitted with a conventional cam and peg steering box. It was fitted to several, mainly British, luxury automobiles of the era. Production continued up to 1973, with just over 105,000 units being produced. As a \\"first generation\\" assistance system, applications were somewhat varied in their tuning of the many system dynamics to the specific vehicle. The system fell out of use as powered rack and pinion steering systems gained in popularity. The 1960s Hydrosteer system should not be confused with Hydrosteer Pty Ltd, an Australian company established in 1981 as a provider of heavy truck steering technology in that country. Adoption The Hydrosteer power steering system was fitted to the following cars: Austin Westminster A110 (optional) Facel Vega II (optional) Humber Super Snipe Series V (optional) Humber Imperial Rover P5 3-Litre Mark 1a (optional) Rover P5 3-Litre Mark 2 Saloon and Coupe Rover P5 3-Litre Mark 3 Saloon and Coupe Rover P5B 3.5-Litre Saloon and Coupe Vanden Plas Princess 3 Litre Mk II (optional) Vanden Plas Princess 4-Litre R Wolseley 6/110 (optional) Operation Hydrosteer Powered Steering, article in Automobile Engineer, May 1960 The Hydrosteer system was based on a conventional cam-and-peg mechanism, except that the cam is surrounded by the skirt of a piston within the body of the steering box. Hydraulic power from the power steering pump is transmitted directly from the piston to the peg carrier. A spool type hydraulic valve moves along the axis of the cam in response to steering wheel movement, causing oil pressure to be applied to one side or other of the piston according to the direction the steering wheel is turned, and the load on the input and output shafts. The cam track is not a regular helix but varies in pitch angle and depth. The variation in steering ratio between straight ahead and full lock results from the variance in pitch angle of the track. The more the steering wheel is turned, the lower the steering ratio becomes. In the Rover P5B, for example,Rover 3 & 3.5 Litre Workshop Manual Saloon and Coupe, Rover British Leyland UK Ltd, the ratio of the power steering unit was 16:1 at the straight ahead and 11.3:1 at full lock. The effect of the variable ratio is to give very light and relaxed steering at the straight ahead, with increased reaction when cornering. The system was designed to be fail-safe, so that the driver should still be able to steer in the event of a failure of the power system. Benefits and drawbacks The major benefit of the Hydrosteer system is reduction in the amount of steering effort required of the driver, particularly at low road speeds or when a lot of turning is involved. Also, the Hydrosteer system was fully integrated into the steering box with no external jacks, giving it an advantage over earlier systems with external jacks, which needed more space and were heavier. Whilst advanced for its time, the Hydrosteer system did have certain drawbacks, in common with all variable ratio steering systems of the era. It was more complicated and expensive than a constant ratio power assisted system. The Hydrosteer system was also criticised for feeling far too light under most circumstances. An article in Car magazine in January 1968Rover 3 & 3.5 litre 1958-1973, road tests, Brooklands Books, on the Rover P5B was particularly scathing about the lightness and lack of feel of Hydrosteer steering. Similar criticism appeared in other contemporary road test articles on the Rover and Vanden Plas 4-Litre R. Much of the blame for this may lie with the cars' manufacturers, who would have instructed Hydrosteer what to supply in terms of number of turns lock-to-lock and degree of power assistance. Use of the Hydrosteer system in cars effectively died out with the generation of 1960s models to which it was fitted. For example, the Rover P6B 3500S that followed the Rover P5B used the Marles Varamatic variable ratio system, which was slightly heavier in most circumstances than the Rover P5 system and arguably had more road feel, although that system too failed to survive much beyond the 1970s.

The most prominent event of the day is gathering in the tomb of Cyrus, located in Pasargadae.  History of observance  Cyrus the Great Day is an invented tradition introduced in the early 2000s, on the internet and social networking websites. Based on some historical records, 29 October was the day when Cyrus entered Babylon. It is celebrated by Iranian nationalists and monarchists to pay homage to Iran's pre-Islamic history. The observance is unofficial, and is not designated on any official calendar, neither on the Iranian calendar nor on those of the UNESCO. There has been calls for the Iranian government to recognize it as an official state ceremony. In 2017, Bahram Parsaei, representative of Shiraz in the parliament voiced the demand.  2016 Cyrus the Great Revolt  Pasargadae on 28 October 2016 2016 Cyrus day occurred on 28 October (due to the overlap of leap years in the Iranian and Gregorian calendars) and fell on Friday (Iranian weekend). Pasargadae attracted thousands of people from across the country who celebrated the day and chanted nationalist slogans. Nomad people, tribesmen and ethnic minorities, including Kurds and Iranian Arabs were present in their traditional clothing. The attendance was unprecedented according to spectators, and the roads leading to the tomb reportedly saw a 30/40-kilometer traffic jam. An unofficial estimation puts the attendance figure between 15,000 and 20,000. = Political dimensions = The gathering turned into protests against the government. \\"No Gaza, no Lebanon, [we will only] sacrifice ourselves for Iran!\\", \\"Iran is our homeland; Cyrus is our father,\\" and ‚ÄúClerical rule is synonymous with only tyranny, only war,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFreedom of thought cannot take place with beards‚Äù were among the slogans in the amateur videos going viral on social media.

Australia is one of the most highly urbanised societies in the world. Continued population growth in Australian cities is placing increasing pressure on infrastructure, such as public transport and roadways, energy, air and water systems within the urban environment. Urban planning is undertaken at all levels of Government in Australia. However, the Federal Government is playing an increasing part in setting policy as part of an overall response to developing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The local government has also been engaging with the community to make decisions on urban planning designs that help to promote social cohesion. Over the past few decades Australians have developed a respect for urban heritage places and community groups have fought hard to stop developers from destroying them. History Urban planning in Australia has evolved since early British colonial settlement, and has been heavily influenced by contemporary planning movements in Britain, the United States of America and western Europe.Freestone 2007 p. 67 However, over the past century, distinctly Australian responses and solutions to Australian urban issues have developed. =The British Colonial Period (1788‚Äì1901)= Adelaide city centre was designed in grid pattern in 1837 The first examples of town planning in Australia occurred during the early phases of the Colonial era, where critical decisions locked in 'path dependency' for the future form of cities.Troy 1995 p. 15 Typically this involved colonial Governors undertaking surveying for land grants and subdivisions, and making executive decisions on the location and construction of roads, rail transport, water supply and other basic infrastructure to support early penal and military settlements. Primacy was given to the functional and practical needs of Colonial administration, as opposed to more lofty civic or aesthetic ideals.Freestone 2007 p.68 Despite these humble, utilitarian beginnings, there were places where clear planning and design for settlements occurred. One of the earliest forms of a planned settlement in Australia involved the work of Colonel William Light, a Colonial Surveyor and the Surveyor-General for the colony of South Australia, in planning and designing the original city centre grid for Adelaide in 1837. While Light's plan was not entirely realised, it is widely regarded as a fine achievement of colonial era civic design.Bunker 1997 p. 244 Rapid colonial expansion in the 19th century, matched by economic growth, resulted in Australia becoming one of the most highly urbanised nations in the world. For example, by 1861, 40% of Sydney's residents lived in suburbs.Steele & Gleeson, 2010 p. 305 This trend towards urbanisation was established early and continued into the 20th century. =Early 20th century= Australia's rapid urbanization meant urban planning became an increasingly important issue, with the early decades of the century characterised by political, civic and academic discussion around the coordinated planning and administration of rapidly growing metropolitan regions. Early town planners focused on the orderly planning of cities, closely following international contemporary town planning and urban reform movements (especially from the UK), where urban planning aimed to improve urban health, efficiency and aesthetics.Toon & Falk 2003 p. 4 Griffins triangle from his plan for Canberra This concern with civic improvement was expressed in many ways, with citizen groups forming in Australian cities to advocate healthier, more beautiful cities.Bonyhardy 2000 p. 21 In Sydney, this desire to improve planning found its expression through a Royal Commission into the Improvement of Sydney and its suburbs, which commenced in 1908, focusing on transportation, slum clearance, the future growth of Sydney, and aesthetics.Freestone and Ashton 2008 The Garden City movement, founded by Ebenezer Howard in the UK, was also influential and was adopted as a design strategy in several areas of Australian cities (such as in Daceyville in south eastern Sydney). One of the earliest international contributions made by Australia to urban planning theory and practice resulted from the international competition held to design Australia's new federal capital, Canberra, which was held between 1911 and 1912. The winning design was submitted by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, with the design reflecting state of the art planning concepts from the time. Whilst Canberra was actually constructed some time after the competition, it still represented an early international example of a planned city.  Urban Reform Movement  During this era there were two main approaches to urban reform: a movement towards the creation of a legal framework for town planning, and efforts towards creating large metropolitan governments, known as the 'greater city movement'.Minnery, John (July 14 2004). 'The wonderful possibilities of the future‚Äô: Political and administrative influences on urban planning in Greater Brisbane. International Planning History Conference Barcelona. The efforts of those advocating for legislative changes led to the establishment of town planning commissions in Sydney (1922), Melbourne (1923) and Perth (1928), and the enactment of the first planning legislation in Australia. These commissions were important developments in the history of Australian town planning, but were ultimately ineffective in achieving town planning objectives. The greater city movements of Australia led to the creation of a greater Brisbane (1925), with smaller and more limited successes in Newcastle (1938) and Perth (1914‚Äì1917). However, elsewhere the movement was entirely unsuccessful, and following World War II, progress towards metropolitan planning was achieved through the creation of statutory planning agencies under the direction of the state governments. Today, the idea of a single metropolitan municipal government coordinating development and infrastructure is seen as a largely discredited model of urban and regional planning. =The Post World War II period (1945+) = Australian cities and urban centres, particularly capital cities, experienced significant growth after World War II, which was largely driven by a combination of rapid economic expansion, high birth rates and unparalleled levels of immigration, particularly from western Europe and, from the 1970s, south east Asia. Furthermore, increasing ownership of the motor car, combined with cheap fuel, resulted in an explosion in the urban form of many Australian urban centres.Owen 2010 p. 143 Many cities were rapidly transformed from modest, medium density centres, supported by public transport, to a suburban, car dominated city with large, residential dormitory suburbs. As a consequence, population and land use become increasingly dispersed. For example, in 1840 40% of Sydney's residents lived in suburbs, while by the 1960s this figure had risen to over 70%.Steele & Gleeson 2010 p. 305 =Metropolitan planning= Public housing (on the left) and apartments in Sydney. Australia's long period of post war economic growth resulted in Federal and State governments developing metropolitan plans in an attempt to address some of the negative aspects associated with urban growth.Yiftachel 1989 p. 29 Typically, many capital cities engaged in creating metropolitan wide spatial plans to guide development over long periods of up to 20 years or more. Particular focus was given to land release on the Rural-urban fringe, establishing a hierarchy of urban centres, the construction of new public housing estates and a preference towards building car based infrastructure (such as new highways, etc.). Examples include the Sydney County of Cumberland Plan of 1948 (regarded as the first metropolitan plan for Sydney) and the Sydney Region Outline Plan of 1968. From the early 1970s the Australian Federal Government became directly involved in urban policy with the Whitlam Labour government establishing for the first time a federal Department of Urban and Regional Development.Freestone 2007 p. 79 Federal government involvement included taking care of sewage servicing backlogs in major metropolitan centres, the establishment of growth centres and new towns to foster de-centralization, funding infrastructure and public housing. Australian Planning Frameworks Urban planning in Australia is a distinct, defined profession, represented by a peak industry group called the Planning Institute of Australia. Similarly, urban planning activities in Australia are codified in law, with a significant body of legislation and case law guiding planning principles and decisions.Williams, 2007 p. 93 Australia's federal system of governance, the nationwide Australian Government, the six states and two territories have their own urban planning laws and procedures resulting in separate systems of planning and land use management, including separate administrative departments that oversee and regulate planning and land use activities.Farrier et al 2009 p. ix Consequently, there is no single urban planning system for Australia ‚Äì rather, there are a number of planning systems that operate largely independently of each other along state based lines.Williams 2007 p. 94 = Australian Federal Government = Urban planning is not specifically referred to in the Constitution of Australia as a Federal Government responsibility. Nevertheless, the Federal Government is increasingly playing a role in the urban planning process in Australia, mainly through the regulation of development on areas that are of national environmental significance, or through actual development activities on federal land. Examples of this are where the Federal Government has actively sought to provide strategic guidance and direction in urban policy, starting with the Whitlam Labour Government in the early 1970s, the Building Better Cities Program of the mid-1990s,Freestone 2007 p. 87 and, most recently, with the release of a National Urban Policy in 2011. The National Urban Policy was released by the Minister for Infrastructure in 2011 and establishes for the first time the Australian Government's overarching goals for the nation's cities and how to make them more productive and sustainable.DIT, 2011 The principal piece of Commonwealth legislation impacting urban planning decisions is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which establishes a framework for assessing impacts on threatened species of national significance, world heritage sites, nuclear actions, and national heritage places, amongst other considerations.DSEWPC, 2011 = New South Wales = Land use planning in New South Wales (NSW) is principally controlled under the provisions of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A; Act). The EP&A; Act establishes a number of key planning considerations in NSW, including: * The role of the Minister for Planning in NSW, as well as the administrative functions of the New South Wales Department of Planning; * Strategic plan making functions, either through a State Environmental Planning Policy, Local Environmental Plan or Development Control Plan; * Environmental assessment functions: and * The role of the Greater Sydney Commission.http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s53a.html In addition to the legislative framework governing land use and urban planning in New South Wales, the Minister for Planning, through the Department of Planning and Infrastructure, publishes a Metropolitan Plan for Sydney, along with Regional Strategies for the Far North Coast, Mid North Coast, Lower Hunter, Illawarra, Sydney to Canberra Corridor, and Murray regions. Whilst not provided for explicitly in the EP&A; Act, these strategic planning documents provide a basis for more detailed planning at the Local Government Council, and sub-regional levels (especially in the Sydney Metropolitan Area). Given that urban planning in NSW is codified through specific legislation, there is a dedicated Land and Environment Court of New South Wales to deal with urban planning disputes. Typically, these most urban planning cases heard by the Land and Environment Court deal with development assessment matters. =Western Australia= In Western Australia urban planning is primarily directed by the Western Australian Planning Commission, a statutory authority of the Government of Western Australia. and implemented by the Department of Planning, Lands & Heritage and local government authorities. Key legislation is the Environmental Protection Act 1986 and the Planning and Development Act 2005.  Challenges  = Population growth and demographic change = Population growth and demographic change is a key consideration for Australian urban planning. Data in the 2006 census in Australia indicates that over 75% of all Australians live in 17 cities each with a population size of over 100,000.DIT, 2010, p.28. The five largest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide contain the majority (60.8%) of urban Australians. According to projections from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of the Treasury (Australia) it is anticipated that Australia's population will continue growing and will reach 35 million by 2050. It is estimated that 72% of this growth will occur in cities. The Department of the Treasury produced an Intergenerational Report in 2010 which predicts that there will be 8.1 million Australians over the age of 65 years by 2050. This compares to 2.6 million in 2006. This prediction for an aging population in Australia is attributed to low fertility rates and increasing life expectancy.Hugo, 1974, p.24. At the same time it is predicted that households will increase from 7.4 million in 2001 to 10.2 million in 2026 while decline of household size is expected from 2.6 in 2001 to 2.3 in 2026. The composition and size of households varies across Australian cities. A significant proportion of population growth since 2000 has been attributed to overseas immigration to Australia. In 2007‚Äì08 the Australian Bureau of Statistics data records that migration contributed 60% of population growth.DIT, 2010, p.33. Long term migration to Australia has meant that 24% of the population was born overseas. The majority of these migrants live in the major cities.DIT, 2010, p.34. As well as overseas migration some cities are also experiencing internal movement. In 2007‚Äì08 New South Wales experienced a net loss of 19,831 whereas Queensland had a net gain of 18,388.DIT, 2010, p.36. The structure of households within urban cities in Australia has also changed. There is an increasing trend towards couple only, lone parent and single person households with only a marginal increase in parents with children.Randolph, 2004, p.484. Despite the trend towards smaller households Australian cities still showed growth in couples with children that was above the overall Australian average. Consequently, cities are still the place where the next generation Australian will be raised. These demographic changes, in particular the population ageing and increase in smaller households, is leading to a greater demand in urban planning for housing and also different types of housing overall. Some metropolitan areas are experiencing housing shortages, particularly with regards to the provision of affordable accommodation. It is also placing pressure on housing affordability where there is only a single income.Randolph, 2004, p.485. = Sustainability = Trends in population growth, transport emissions, energy usage, waste management, urban development, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events (such as droughts, heat waves, severe storms, bushfires, extensive flooding) are highlighting the need for increasing focus on sustainability in Australian cities.Council House 2, Melbourne. An example of sustainable design Transport emissions have been reported as one of strongest areas of emissions growth in Australia, which is a consequence of the distance separating many land uses, and of the underlying low density form of many Australian metropolitan areas. Private car use has continued to increase which is leading to greater levels of city congestion and urban air quality challenges.DIT, 2010, p.70 The cost of congestion to the Australia economy was estimated at $9.4 billion in 2005 with a prediction of a rise in cost to $20 billion by 2020 unless the issue is addressed. Research indicates that while the total levels of key pollutants in cities has fallen over the last ten years as a result of improved fuel and emissions standards, particulate air pollution and ozone levels remain above the national air quality standard.DIT, 2010, p.71 Rates of recycling nationally have increased, however waste generation has also increased over the period 2002‚Äì03 to 2006‚Äì07 by 31%. This exceeds the population increase of 5.6% over the same period. As a result, this has placed pressure on governments to adequate plan for landfill and associated waste management facilities in metropolitan areas. Data on rainfall patterns in eastern and southwest Australia, where the major cities are located, indicates a decline in the annual rate of rainfall per decade of up to 50 mm since 1950. This is providing challenges in terms of both availability and the quality of water supplies, particularly when combined with population growth. At the planning level basic aspects of sustainable housing design such as raising density, mixed use, promoting mixed use development, and encouraging transit oriented development to increase trips made by public transport have been progressively adopted as policy responses in Australian cities.Crabtree, 2005, p.333 Sustainable building codes such as the Victoria's Green Star (Australia) rating and New South Wales' BASIX sustainability assessment tool are being applied to new developments to improve energy and water conservation at the individual building scale. Further improvements in waste, water, energy and onsite food production are being progressively seen as a necessary and significant part of planning for urban sustainability in Australian cities.DSEWPC, 2002, p.4. = Water sensitive urban design = Water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) has evolved to become a framework for integrating the management of urban water within the practice of sustainable urban design in Australia.Wong, 2006, p.213. Water sensitive design aims to ensure that the management of urban water occurs with sensitivity towards natural water systems and the broader ecosystem that the water systems support.AGNWC, 2010 Within the frame-work planners consider: * protecting natural systems and water quality through filtration and retention and removal of pollutants close to their source;Melbourne Water, n.d. * integration of the potable drinking water covering both the piped system from catchments outside the urban area as well as water itself treated to drinking water standard; * sewerage which encompasses the pipe system for handling the collection and transport of wastewater to treatment plants; and * Integrated storm water drainage and treatment/re-use as part of the urban landscape.Wong, 2006, An Overview, p.2. WSUD incorporates planning and design as it relates to the building and landscape architecture on site and also in the context of wider local and regional initiatives.Wong, Water sensitive urban design, 2006, p.214. = Urban renewal and consolidation = Urban renewal and consolidation is changing the character of Australian cities. Planning strategies have focused on containing the outward physical sprawl of cities whilst at the same time emphasis has been placed on redeveloping the inner city and older employment zones as new residential spaces.Randolph, 2004, p.487 A new inner urban city middle class has emerged which has driven the renovation and restoration of the housing stock formally owned by older inner city working class communities. The transformation of these areas has predominantly seen the end of these areas being viewed as places of social disadvantage. Melbourne docklands development, 2009 In parallel to the renovation of the housing stock there has also been a revitalization of disused industrial and commercial spaces such as warehouses and docklands and these have been transformed into new residential, commercial and recreational spaces often with high density development. Examples include the Docklands development in Melbourne, Green Square, Victoria Park and Barrangaroo in Sydney and South Bank in Brisbane. High density living in Australian cities is limited to the inner urban cores of major metropolitan areas, and is substantially less dense than comparable cities in Asia and Europe. Typically most urban housing development focused on a single one level house (although this is changing) on a separate block of land. There has been a small amount of low rise apartments in inner city areas since the 1930s but this started to change since the introduction of Strata Title legislation in the 1960s.Randolph, 2006, p.474. The Strata Title legislation enabled individuals to own individual apartments in a multi-apartment block on a single piece of land. Before this apartment blocks were predominantly owned as a single property by landlords. The introduction of Strata Titles also enabled easier financing arrangements for individuals wishing to purchase a single apartment. Strata titles cover both apartments as well as attached dwellings such as town houses where these have been developed on a single title of land. Once introduced Strata Titling facilitated the redevelopment, particularly in valuable areas or often close to transport infrastructure, of older housing on larger pieces of land which were replaced with apartment blocks. Going forward this style of higher density housing is expected to play a large part in meeting housing needs for the changing demographics of an aging population and smaller households in Australian cities.Hugo, 2010, p.41. For example, the Sydney Metropolitan Plan 2036 has a growth target of 70% of all new housing to be in the existing urban footprint, with 80% of all housing to be within a 20-minute commute of a major centre. To facilitate this, the Minister for Planning in NSW released an Urban Renewal Planning Policy to specifically deliver urban renewal in key sites in the Sydney Metropolitan area. Several urban renewal projects are planned and underway in Sydney, with the NSW Government unveiling the Greater Sydney Region Plan in 2018 which identifies urban renewal corridors and a vision for three metropolitan cities. = Climate Change = Climate change is an important factor in the decision making process for urban planning in Australia because of the highly urbanised population prone to extreme weather patterns. Australia's urban areas are susceptible to changes in the climate because of the physical construction of the built environment, infrastructure, and its ecological correlation with the urban ecosystem.Bambrick et al. 2011, p.68S. Over 80% of the Australian population lives in the coastal area of Australia and many on the fringe of bush land and rivers making them vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These effects include sea level rise, increased storm surges resulting in coastal erosion, strong winds, intense rainfall causing flash flooding and bushfires due to increased temperatures.Norman, 2010 The Australian Federal Government is in the process of developing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies along with risk assessment analysis initiatives to urban planning. Historically urban planning has been the role of the state, regional and local governments but since December 2009 the Australian Federal Government has re-engaged in a strategic decision making process to prepare for climate change. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE) has developed adaption programs and risk assessments. A risk assessment has been calculated for possible effects on urban areas due to climate change and replacement values for transport, industrial, residential and commercial infrastructure runs into billions of dollars.DCCEE 2011 Therefore, avoidance of future risk is the most cost-effective approach to urban planning. The options for coastal and riverside management to deal with sea level rise and storm surges fall into three categories; \\"retreat\\", \\"accommodate\\" and \\"protect\\".Thom et al. 2009 \\"Retreat\\" entails relocating coastal and riverside infrastructure that are high risk of damage from extreme weather patterns, as well as designing buildings and infrastructures in new locations away from potential risk areas. \\"Accommodate\\" means adapting the existing built environments to effectively cope with the changing conditions such as Island raising through adding sand to beaches and raising infrastructure and buildings near the coast and riverside. \\"Protect\\" involves building sea walls and levees to prevent damage from storm surges and sea level rise.Walsh et al. 2004, p.595. There are a number of simple but effective adaptation options possible at a local scale to deal with intense rainfall and temperature rises. These include reducing impervious surfaces to allow for water infiltration, tree planting in urban areas to reduce the \\"heat island effect\\" and constructing transport facilities away from flood areas. Designing buildings with natural ventilation and building insulation will also help with increasing temperatures. While the only possible solution to bushfires might be to increase fire breaks between the houses and bush land. = Heritage and Conservation = The Rocks, Sydney, 2010. The Green Ban prevented development in this area. Politicians, planners and the community came to see the value of heritage buildings in Australia only recently in the 1970s.Freestone 1993, p.18. Laws and policies are now in place to conserve and protect historic buildings across Australia. The Green Ban is a key aspect in the initiation of these regulations especially the impact it had on proposed urban development in the city of Sydney.Burgmann M & Burgmann V 2011 The Sydney Opera House is included on the heritage list of Australia. In the early twentieth century there was no historic sense of preservation with regard to the built environment and people were happy to see the old replaced by the new. Then in the 1970s came the Green Bans movement imposed by builders labourers across Australia, being particularly prominent in Sydney. The Green Ban was created to defend the demolition of older style buildings that were to make way for new developments of skyscrapers, shopping precincts and luxury apartments. It was initiated by the builders labourers that were hired to construct these new buildings and was the first of its kind around the world. The key element of the movement came from the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation (NSWBLF) which consisted of over 100 union members that belonged to the Communist Party of Australia. The most famous union leaders of the NSWBLF were Bob Pringle, Joe Owens and Jack Mundey. Many critics of the union disputed that they were denying workers employment but the union responded that they wanted to build but in a way that enhanced the built environment, such as schools and houses for the everyday person not buildings based on developers' needs.Burgmann V 1993 Among the 40 green bans imposed in NSW, The Rocks in Sydney was the most significant areas saved. The green ban prevented the demolition of some of the oldest buildings in Australia and beautiful foreshore parks which were going to be replaced by concrete, glass office blocks. States and territories of Australia have since implemented heritage acts and have heritage frameworks in place to protect buildings and places of cultural significance. On a national scale in 1999 the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was introduced which outlines a National Heritage List (NHL).Freestone, Marsden & Garnaut 2008, p.158. The NHL is in place to protect \\"exceptional natural and cultural places that contribute to Australia's national identity\\".DSEWPC, 2011, National heritage Since then measurements of heritage have evolved and in 2011, there are 113 places listed of iconic heritage value to the whole of Australia, which include the Sydney Opera House, Melbourne Cricket Ground and Anzac Parade in Canberra.DSEWPC, 2011, Find places on the national heritage list Urban planning in Australia in the 21st century now has very strict guidelines to follow and heritage is of fundamental significance in the decision making process before any construction takes place. As developers now know there will always be people watching and ready to protect Australia's cultural history. = Community Participation = The Australian government has begun to see community engagement in the decision making process of urban planning of fundamental importance. Due to this engagement local governments have looked for ways to design urban infrastructure in a way that helps to encourage social cohesion. However, there is still room for developing a method that uses community involvement more effectively. Community participation has also created many barriers along the way by preventing urban planning projects from proceeding.Mahjabeen & Shrestha, n.d., p.21 Previously, urban planning in Australia quite often did not involve the community and projects went ahead to construct residential buildings that were crammed into small areas and did not provide space for recreation and socialising. Recently this approach has changed and planners have realised the importance of creating an urban environment that encourages social behavior among its residents.Department of Parliamentary Services, 2010 These new designs incorporate active living and recreational areas that provide for social connectivity and wellbeing. This new approach has come through feedback from the community showing the positive effects of their involvement. In 2008, the Australian federal government headed by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd inaugurated the Department of Infrastructure and Transport to work with the newly established Major Cities Unit (MCU)in an effort to involve the community to develop urban environments into more productive and sustainable places. From then on the MCU has been researching ways to develop policies that improve urban planning to make cities more socially inclusive and encouraging the community to actively participate in the decision making process.Urban Design Forum 2011 In May 2011, national urban new policies were released by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese which promised to: \\"enhance the livability of cities by promoting better urban design, planning and affordable access to recreational, cultural and community facilities.\\" Urban Analyst 2011 There is still a need to develop more effective participation from the community. Often the participants do not represent the views of the whole community and disadvantaged groups such as the poor and minorities do not get a fair say in the urban planning process.Mahjabeen, Shrestha, Dee 2008, p.168. = Integrating Land Use and Public Transport = Peak hour traffic in Melbourne Australia's urban transport system could become under increasing demand as the population grows and Australia moves to a more environmentally friendly urban system. Some of Australia's urban problems such as road congestion and pollution could be solved by the improvement of public transport, as it is a crucial aspect in creating a functional, sustainable city.Mees & Dodson 2011 The urban structure of Australian cities consists of dispersed suburbs and dense central building districts which creates immense planning challenges for decision makers. Urban planners now realise the need to integrate active and sustainable public transport with destinations accessible to alternative modes of transport such as cycling and walking to encourage people to reduce the stress of cars on the roads.Thinking Transport, n.d. Road transport contributes to 88% of all transport emissions and the cities of Australia are congested not only by automobiles but the parking lots they use.Tiwari, Cervero & Schipper 2011, p.394 In March 2006, 75% of adults in Australian cities travelled to work or study by private automobile in comparison to 19% that used public transport and 5% that walked or cycled.ABS 2009 Reducing private automobile dependence will improve the pollution problem and free up land to build more needed infrastructure such as schools, houses and hospitals. To encourage Australians to use public transport research suggests it should be more efficient (timely, reliable, and accessible) and affordable.Bambrick et al. 2011, p.71S The Australian Transport Council has found that the current networks of buses and trains in Australian cities need to be integrated with effective land use.ATC, 2003 At the moment buses and trains run along the same routes competing with each other. Ideally trains are used to travel long distances, with a high passenger capacity and avoid the traffic signals. Buses should be in place as an intermediary for fast inner city train networks and for passengers to access surrounding suburbs not suitable for trains. Land use integration would mean that urban planners design infrastructure around public transport to enable the public to have access to transport within close walking distance from their home or work. Some urban planners and policy makers think there is a need to remove car parks, build upon current transport infrastructure to create a more efficient system that facilitates urban regeneration.

It is in 5.8 hectares of deciduous forest on the western slope of Grafton Gully, by the corner of Symonds Street and Karangahape Road, and is crossed by the Grafton Bridge. The street (and by extension the cemetery) are named for William Cornwallis Symonds, a British Army officer prominent in the early colonisation of New Zealand. It has a Historic Place - Category I listing with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Maintenance and administration of the cemetery is provided by the Auckland Council. History Maungawhau / Mount Eden in the background Symonds Street Cemetery was the first official cemetery in Auckland, in use from 1842.. Originally it was divided into four sections for Anglicans, Catholics, Jews, and a shared Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and general section. By 1852, the shared section became Presbyterian, and an additional Wesleyan and general section was added. After the establishment of a new municipal cemetery in West Auckland at Waikumete, the Symonds Street Cemetery was closed for burials in 1886, other than to existing family plots. No new plots were sold. In 1909 the Auckland City Council took over management of the cemetery. Due to development of the Auckland Southern Motorway during the mid-1960s, more than 4,100 bodies were moved and re-interred into two memorial sites at the cemetery, and the land area was reduced by about a quarter. During the relocation, 2000 graves were found under 1200 headstones in the Anglican section, and 2100 graves under 400 headstones were found in the Catholic section. Many of Auckland's early colonists are buried here, including William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand and co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi. The New Zealand Herald columnist Brian Rudman has repeatedly criticised the state of disrepair, vandalism, and the presence of vagrants at the cemetery, and called for the city council to improve the maintenance. Although the Auckland City Council commissioned the Symonds St Cemetery Conservation Plan in 1996, only some of its recommendations have been carried out. The Council does employ a specialist stonemason to undertake gravestone restoration with a specialist stonemason, but as many of the restored gravestones have been subsequently vandalised the Waitamata Local Board admits the situation is much like \\"treading water\\". Security guards do patrol the cemetery at irregular intervals, but have proved largely ineffective in stopping further damage, in particular their inability to distinguish between vagrants and other members of the public have led to embarrassing situations, including the ejection of a heritage tour party on 25 September 2008. This tour was part of the Auckland Heritage Festival organised by Auckland City Council itself. In October 2012 more than 20 of the headstones were sprayed with antisemitic graffiti and swastikas. The vandalism occurred the night before a white nationalist celebration called \\"Flag Day\\". Three people were arrested, but in November the charges against one were dropped due to a lack of evidence.

The first known use of the term was in 1879. Over time, cycle rickshaws (also known as pedicabs or trishaws), auto rickshaws, and electric rickshaws were invented, and have replaced the original pulled rickshaws, with a few exceptions for their use in tourism. Pulled rickshaws created a popular form of transportation, and a source of employment for male labourers, within Asian cities in the 19th century. Their appearance was related to newly acquired knowledge of ball-bearing systems. Their popularity declined as cars, trains and other forms of transportation became widely available. Auto rickshaws are becoming more popular in some cities in the 21st century as an alternative to taxis because of their low cost of hire. Etymology (video) Various rickshaws for tourists in Asakusa, Japan (2015). Rickshaw originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha (, jin = human, riki = power or force, sha = vehicle), which literally means \\"human-powered vehicle\\". History =Origin= The first rickshaws were invented in France in the late 17th century, to fulfill, along with other types of carriages such as cabriolets and fiacres, the unmet demand for public transportation created by the 1679 cessation of Paris' first omnibus service. These vehicles, called \\"vinaigrettes\\" for their resemblance to the handcarts used by contemporary vinegar-sellers, were fully-enclosed two-wheeled carriages with space for a single person. Usually, they were moved by two people; one holding the bars at the front and the other pushing from behind.Mellot and Blancart (2006), p. 7. Rickshaws were independently invented in Japan circa 1869, after the lifting of a ban on wheeled vehicles from the Tokugawa period (1603‚Äì1868), and at the beginning of a period of rapid technical advancement in Japan. Inventor There are many theories about the inventor, with the most likely and widely accepted theory describing the rickshaw as having been invented in Japan in 1869, by Izumi Yosuke, who formed a partnership with Suzuki Tokujiro and Takayama Kosuke to build the vehicles, having been \\"inspired by the horse carriages that had been introduced to the streets of Tokyo a few years earlier\\". Other theories about the inventor of the rickshaw include: * Jonathan Scobie (or Jonathan Goble), an American missionary to Japan, is said to have invented the rickshaw around 1869 to transport his invalid wife through the streets of Yokohama. * An American blacksmith named Albert Tolman is said to have invented the rickshaw, or \\"man drawn lorry\\" in 1846 in Worcester, Massachusetts, for a South American bound missionary. * In New Jersey, the Burlington County Historical Society claims an 1867 invention by carriage maker James Birch, and exhibits a Birch rickshaw in its museum. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories: > Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be > Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers > the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention. =Description= The vehicle had a wooden carriage that rode on \\"superior Western wheels\\" and was a dramatic improvement over earlier modes of transportation. Whereas the earlier sedan chairs required two people, the rickshaw generally only required one. More than one person was required for hilly or mountainous areas. It also provided a smoother ride for the passenger. Other forms of vehicles at the time were drawn by animals or were wheelbarrows. The Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia, has had a rickshaw in its collection for over 120 years. It was made about 1880 and is described as: > A rickshaw, or jinrikisha, is a light, two-wheeled cart consisting of a > doorless, chairlike body, mounted on springs with a collapsible hood and two > shafts. Finished in black lacquer-ware over timber, it was drawn by a single > rickshaw runner. =Late 19th century= 19th century rickshaw in Hanoi. In the Late 19th century, hand-pulled rickshaws became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia. Peasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner. It was \\"the deadliest occupation in the East, [and] the most degrading for human beings to pursue.\\" Japan Edward, Prince of Wales, and his staff disguised as rickshaw men during his visit to Japan in 1922. He bought the clothes himself in Kyoto. Starting in 1870, the Tokyo government issued a permit to build and sell ‰∫∫ÂäõËªä (jinrikisha: rickshaw in Japanese) to the trio that are believed in Asia to be the rickshaw's inventors: Izumi Yosuke, Takayama Kosuke, and Suzuki Tokujiro. In order to operate a rickshaw in Tokyo, a seal was required from these men. By 1872, they replaced the kago and norimono, becoming the main mode of transportation in Japan, with about 40,000 rickshaws in service. At that time man-power was much cheaper than horse-power; horses were generally only used by the military. Some of the rickshaws were artistically decorated with paintings and rear elevations. In this time, the more exuberant styles of decorations were banned. If the families were well-off financially they might have their own rickshaw runner. Generally, runners covered in a day, at an average traveling speed of per hour. Japanese rickshaw manufacturers produced and exported rickshaws to Asian countries and South Africa. Singapore Singapore received its first rickshaws in 1880 and soon after they were prolific, making a \\"noticeable change in the traffic on Singapore's streets.\\" Bullock carts and gharries were used before rickshaws were introduced. Many of the poorest individuals in Singapore in the late nineteenth century were poverty-stricken, unskilled people of Chinese ancestry. Sometimes called coolies, the hardworking men found that pulling a rickshaw was a new opportunity for employment. In 1897, martial law was declared to end a four- day rickshaw workers' strike.

In China, the rickshaw was first seen in 1873 and was used for public transportation the following year. Within a year there were 10,000 rickshaws in operation.Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century Around 1880 rickshaws appeared in India, first introduced in Simla by Reverend J. Fordyce. At the turn of the century they were introduced in Calcutta, India, and by 1914 were a conveyance for hire. The rickshaw was also introduced to Korea in the late 19th century. =20th century= After World War II, there was a major shift in the use of man-powered rickshaws: > Hand-pulled rickshaws became an embarrassment to modernizing urban elites in > the Third World, and were widely banned, in part because they were symbolic, > not of modernity, but of a feudal world of openly marked class distinctions. > Perhaps the seated rickshaw passenger is too close to the back of the > laboring driver, who, besides, is metaphorically a draught animal harnessed > between shafts. The cycle rickshaw was built in the 1880s and was first used with regularity starting in 1929 in Singapore. They were found in every south and east Asian country by 1950. By the late 1980s there were estimated 4 million cycle rickshaws in the world. Africa An auto rickshaw (tuk-tuk) in Nairobi. Rickshaws were introduced to Durban, South Africa, and by 1904 there were about 2,000 registered rickshaw pullers. Rickshaws operated in Nairobi in the beginning of the 20th century; pullers went on strike there in 1908. In the 1920s, they were used in Bagamoyo, Tanga, Tanzania and other areas of East Africa for short distances.http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Zulu%20Ricksha.htm Asia The rickshaw's popularity in Japan had declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation like automobiles and trains. After World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary comeback. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in Kyoto and Tokyo's geisha districts. In the 1990s, German-made cycle rickshaws called \\"velotaxis\\" were introduced in Japanese cities, including Kobe. A row of rickshaws parked near a pier in Hong Kong, circa 1930s. In post war Hong Kong, rickshaws was one of the main transportation either for transporting goods or for transporting people during the Japanese invasion, known as the Battle of Hong Kong. Japanese military hired many rickshaw pullers to have them gathered and organize with other cooks and seamen for an underground armed team to enact the anti-British Colony clan. Tsai, Jung-Fang(2005). Wartime Experience, Collective Memories, and Hong Kong Identity. China Review International,2005,Vol.12(1),pp.233. http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P;=AN&K;=19013500&S;=R&D;=asn&EbscoContent;=dGJyMNLr40Sep7c4xNvgOLCmr1Gep7dSs6%2B4TLCWxWXS&ContentCustomer;=dGJyMOzprkmzqbVMuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA However, after World War II, other forms of transport such as pedicabs and streetcar became strong competitors of rickshaws, leading the business of rickshaws into stagnation. Chiuchow men formed a faction within the Canton rickshaw pullers union in the 1920s. In addition, the Chiuchow pullers could be identified by their hats which were rounded and flat at the top; while the rival Hoklo men had a cone-shaped headgear with sharp points at the top. However, rickshaw use began to decline in the 1920s as the new Communist government introduced the streetcar system in 1924. The number of rickshaw pullers had declined from 44,200 to 25,877 six months after the opening of the tramway. It had also caused the Beijing tramway riot in October 1929. A rough form of a rickshaw is sometimes used for hauling coal, building materials or other material. Both motorized and pedal-power cycle rickshaws, or pedicabs, were used for short distance passenger travel. There are still many rickshaws in many cities for either touring purposes (in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, with traditional Chinese rickshaws) or short range transportation in some counties. However, the new Communist government banned rickshaws in Canton in the early 1950s, leading to another low tide of rickshaws. In Singapore, the rickshaw's popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number had doubled by 1930. Cycle rickshaws were used in Singapore beginning in 1929. Within six years pulled rickshaws were outnumbered by cycle rickshaws, which were also used by sightseeing tourists.Suryadinata (1992). p. 40. Cycle rickshaw Bangladeshi Rickshaw in Sweden. In the 1930s, cycle rickshaws were used in Kolkata, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. By 1950 they could be found in many South and East Asian countries. By the end of the 20th century, there were 300,000 such vehicles in Dhaka. By the end of 2013, there were about 100,000 electric rickshaws in Delhi. North America Pedicabs were introduced in North America in 1962, where they were a means of transportation at the Seattle World's Fair in the state of Washington. =21st century= Velotaxis in Nagoya, Japan, 2005. The 21st century has seen a resurgence in rickshaws, particularly in motorized rickshaws and cycle rickshaws. Auto rickshaws, also called velotaxis, have resurged as they are about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of regular taxis. German velotaxis are three- wheeled, powered vehicles with a space for a driver and, behind the driver, space for two passengers. Cycle rickshaws are used in many North American, European, and Asian cities. They are increasingly being used as an eco- friendly way of short-range transportation, particularly in urban areas. Along with auto rickshaws, they are also used (particularly by Asian cities) for tourism, because of their \\"novelty value as an entertaining form of transportation\\". Africa In Madagascar, pulled cycle and auto rickshaws are a common form of transportation in a number of cities, especially Antsirabe. They are known as pousse-pousse, meaning push-push. Asia Macau still uses tri-wheeled bicycle rickshaw, or riquex√≥ in Portuguese, as Macau was a Portuguese colony in the past. This kind of transportation was very famous until the late 20th century, due to the fact of being a small city and few cars, not so many motorcycles, very bad public transport and no other transport such as train or subway. You can go around Macau peninsula and the twos island on rickshaw, and visit the Riquex√≥ Museum and see the evolution of rickshaws from the 18th century until modern times. Automated cycle rickshaws, called velotaxis, are popular in Kyoto and Tokyo, Japan. Their use is growing at a rate of about 20-30% a year in Japanese cities. The traditional rickshaws are still alive for travelers in some tourist places in Japan. Rickshaws are found in Hong Kong. In China, automated and pedal-power cycle rickshaws, or pedicabs, are used for short distance passenger travel in large cities and many medium-sized cities. Most Indian cities offer auto rickshaw service; hand-pulled rickshaws do exist in some areas, such as Kolkata (Calcutta) as a part of their transport system which also includes cycle rickshaws. Sri Lanka has over 1 million auto rickshaws registered in use as of 2018. Australia In Australia, cycle rickshaws or trishaws (3 wheels) are used in Melbourne and St Kilda. They are also seen in Cowaramup, Western Australia at Bakehouse '38. Europe Auto rickshaw located in Brighton Marina. Cycle rickshaws or trishaws (3 wheels) are used in some large continental European cities, such as: * Austria: Vienna * Denmark: Copenhagen and Odense * Estonia: Tallinn * France: Paris and Nantes * Germany: Lake Constance, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover and other cities. * Hungary: Budapest * Ireland: Cork and Dublin. * Italy: Florence, Milan, and Rome * The Netherlands: Amsterdam and in the Caribbean, Willemstad * Norway: Oslo * Poland: Krak√≥w and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ * Russia: Saint Petersburg * Spain: Barcelona * Switzerland: Bern Within the United Kingdom, pedicabs operate in: * London, mostly in Soho and other areas of central London. Their activity is not regulated by Transport for London, so there are no limits of the fees they can charge. * Edinburgh, where vendors are hired like taxis and provide tours. * Oxford. North America A cycle rickshaw (bicitaxi) in Mexico City, 2019. * In Canada there are pedicabs in operation in Victoria and Vancouver. They are regulated in Toronto and Vancouver. Pulled rickshaw rides are available in downtown Ottawa, with tours of historical Byward Market. * In the United States, San Diego and New York City each host hundreds of pedicabs; dozens of other North American cities also have pedicab services. In New York, human powered transport is used primarily by tourists due to its cost. In New Orleans, pedicabs have been utilized to transport French Quarter tourists since the summer of 2012. * In Mexico there are thousands of pedicabs. All drivers are in informal circumstances, and have precarious working conditions, long hours (11.3 hours a day), low wages (US$59.18 per week), and no social protections or benefits. 6.3% reported suffering from a disease, 49.5% corresponded to musculoskeletal conditions and only 11.6% were affiliated to any health system. 53.8% are owners of the vehicle and, although it does not seem to influence physical illness (P=0.03), it is related to the psychosocial ones (P=0.260). Types Types of rickshaws include: * a pulled rickshaw; a two-wheeled passenger cart pulled by a human runner * a cycle rickshaw, also called a pedicab * an auto rickshaw, also called a tuk-tuk, auto, mototaxi, or baby taxi * an electric rickshaw, also called e-rickshaw.

She made her first on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 September 2011. On 21 February 2013, Gumede announced she was leaving the soap at the end of her current storyline. She departed on 3 April 2013, after which her character Kirsty was sent to prison. Gumede has won several awards for her portrayal of Kirsty. Storylines While on a night out, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain) pays Kirsty to flirt with his friend, Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) who is single. Kirsty and Tyrone get on well and they exchange phone numbers. Tyrone later learns that Tommy paid Kirsty but she reveals that she is genuinely interested in him. When Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) parks Rita Sullivan's (Barbara Knox) car across Kirsty's, they argue and Tina accuses Kirsty of scratching Rita's car. However, Kirsty denies it, telling Tina that she is a police officer but dislikes Tina and starts causing problems for her, including getting her accused of suspected shoplifting at a shopping centre and breaking a bottle of her perfume. She accidentally has Rita stopped for speeding but gets the ticket cancelled as she thought Tina would be driving. When Tyrone overhears Kirsty admitting to Tina that she set her up and threatening her, he ends the relationship. When Tina refuses to let her see Tyrone, Kirsty follows them in her police car as she is convinced they are secretly dating, but Tina sees her and is driving to the police station when they are involved in a minor accident and all three are taken to hospital. Kirsty then learns that she is pregnant. Tyrone decides to give Kirsty a second chance but Tina reports Kirsty for harassment but is persuaded to drop the case. Tina, determined to get her out of Tyrone's life, gets Tommy to follow her and when they see her meeting a man, they assume that Kirsty is cheating on Tyrone but are disappointed when Kirsty tells Tyrone that she was meeting her cousin about a present for him and is so disgusted by the accusation of infidelity that she then leaves. Tyrone goes to the police station and apologises before proposing and she accepts. Kirsty threatens Tommy, warning him that no one will ever come between her and Tyrone and is not pleased when Tyrone lends Tommy some money, but agrees to help him investigate Terry Duckworth's (Nigel Pivaro) dealings with a local councillor. Tyrone and Kirsty go to the councillor's office, looking for evidence of corruption but get caught. The councillor is arrested for accepting bribes and Kirsty is sacked from the police force for breaking and entering so Tyrone gets her a job in packing at Underworld. Kirsty, however, is horrified and lashes out at Tyrone with a ladle. She apologises and Tyrone tells his friends that his injuries were accidental. Despite Kirsty insisting that she doesn't want any fuss for her birthday, Tyrone organises a surprise party and invites her parents. When her father learns she is pregnant and was sacked from the police force, he verbally attacks her and leaves, causing another argument between her and Tyrone. When he tries to walk away, she forces him up against a door. Tyrone walks out and when he returns, he finds Kirsty has packed a bag but Tyrone demands an explanation so Kirsty reveals that her father domestically abused her and her mother until she left home. Tyrone forgives Kirsty and she stays. Kirsty helps Tina when she and Tommy are hassled by Rick Neelan (Greg Wood), a loan shark. She uses her police connections to get Rick arrested and Tina thanks her. Kirsty later suffers Braxton Hicks contractions in the cafe and panics when she can't get hold of Tyrone. When she learns that he was fixing Fiz Stape's (Jennie McAlpine) boiler, she gets jealous and they argue again. She destroys plates and a picture of Tyrone and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) but apologises, blaming her pregnancy hormones. When Tyrone and Fiz organise a baby shower and Tyrone tells Kirsty that Fiz helped him pick out items for the baby, she gets jealous again and insists that Tyrone has no further contact with Fiz. Her anger is sparked again when she learns that he has given Tommy a payment holiday so he and Tina can visit his grandmother in Blackpool. This causes another argument and she hits him again, using an accessory from a vacuum cleaner, leaving him badly bruised. This time, Tyrone asks Kirsty to see a doctor about her anger issues but she leaves just before the appointment but Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) tells Tyrone this so they argue in the garden and angry, Tyrone pushes Kirsty away from him and she falls, cutting her head. Deirdre, having overheard the argument, asks Kirsty if she is okay and calls Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor), while Kirsty sends Tyrone to the pub so she can have a nap. When Tyrone returns, he finds Kirsty has packed her bags and she leaves, despite Tyrone asking her to stay. Tommy finds Kirsty at the hospital and asks her to come back, as Tyrone is suffering without her. Despite initially refusing, she returns a couple of days later and finds Tyrone talking to another woman while Dev chats to her friend. He asks her to stay and she agrees, angering Tina so she tells Tommy that Kirsty was abusing Tyrone and insists Tommy and Tina increase their repayments. She also causes problems by costing Tommy a security job and persuading Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) to buy Jason Grimshaw's (Ryan Thomas) flat, making Tina and Tommy homeless. They move into Owen Armstrong's (Ian Puleston-Davies) flat over the builder's yard. Kirsty goes past her due date, but when Tina pushes her into a table during a fight in The Rovers, they realise she is in labour. Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) deliver baby Ruby. After bringing Ruby home, Kirsty struggles and when Ruby won't stop crying, she trashes the house. Tyrone tells her that he does not trust her with Ruby so he is pleased when Kirsty's mother, Alison (Dawn Hope), visits, telling them that she has left Edwin (David Lonsdale). Kirsty reluctantly allows Alison to stay and appreciates her help but Edwin arrives and snatches Ruby briefly to make Alison go home. Kirsty blames Tyrone for her father's reappearance and throws a candlestick at him so Tyrone ends the relationship is over and tells her to leave but insists that Ruby will stay with him. However, Kirsty tells him that he has no legal right to keep Ruby as his name is not on her birth certificate, forcing him to change his mind. Instead, they agree that he will stay at home to look after Ruby, while Kirsty goes back to work. However, Fiz knows about Kirsty's abuse and she notices the change in Fiz's attitude to her. Wanting Tyrone and Ruby to get out and meet people, she asks Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) to take him to a mother and baby group, making Kirsty jealous again so she asks him not to go. When Fiz questions her about this, Kirsty is angered and in revenge, switches Fiz's sewing machine back on while she is trying to repair it, so she needs to go to hospital. Kirsty then takes charge of the first aid and takes Fiz to hospital so no one believes her when she insists Kirsty caused her injury. Realising she cannot trust Tyrone because of numerous texts from Fiz, Kirsty locks Tyrone in the house and takes his phone and keys with her. When Tyrone complains, she attacks him again but this time, shows no remorse and demands he apologize. Tyrone couldn't take any more, planning to run away with Ruby but Fiz and Tommy stop him and suggest he marry Kirsty so he will have parental responsibility. Tyrone and Kirsty make up and they begin planning the wedding. On Tyrone's birthday, Kirsty sees a card from Fiz and punishes him by slamming a door on his arm, injuring him. She apologizes again and they continue with the wedding plans but Kirsty becomes paranoid about Fiz and causes a fight by insulting her and her daughter, Hope. Shortly before the wedding, Kirsty finds Tyrone's secret phone that proves he and Fiz are now having an affair so she invites her to the wedding and during the ceremony, exposes the affair. Kirsty realises that Tyrone was only marrying her for custody of Ruby. At home, they argue on the stairs and when Kirsty tries to hit Tyrone, she loses her balance and falls. At the hospital, Kirsty tells the police that Tyrone has been hitting her for months so the police arrest Tyrone and Ruby goes into temporary foster care. However, he is released on bail. She suggests Tyrone come home and make a fresh start but he refuses, saying that he'll never forgive Kirsty for what she did so she tells Tyrone he can't see Ruby, leading him and Fiz to snatch her and run away. Kirsty is worried about her baby and reports her missing but Fiz knows they can't live on the run and calls the police so Tyrone is arrested. He is charged with assaulting Kirsty, much to her delight. Fiz tells Kirsty that the truth will come out. Fiz and Tina find Alison and tells her what has happened but she refuses to believe them. When she confronts Kirsty, however, she admits it and promises to tell the police everything but changes her mind when she sees Alison leaving Tina's flat. In court, she stuck to her statement, much to Fiz and Alison's disgust. Alison offers to move in with her and help with Ruby, on condition that she tells the truth but Kirsty refuses, telling Alison that she is not welcome. However, the truth comes out when she finds Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) looking after Ruby and angrily chucked her out, shouting at Julie for abandoning her and throws a plate at her. She immediately apologizes, blaming her stressful day. The next day, Ruby won't stop crying and Kirsty asks Dr. Carter for sleeping pills but storms out when he refuses. Julie, worried about what she saw, confronts Kirsty but she loses her temper and slaps Julie and gives her a bloody lip, so she runs out. Realising that now everyone will soon know the truth, she breaks down. When Ruby won't stop crying, she screams at her to shut up. Julie and Sean notice that Ruby has stopped crying and go to investigate, finding the house empty so Brian and Julie go to court but are told that Julie's complaint is not relevant to Tyrone's case and to go to the police if they want to make a formal complaint. Meanwhile, Kirsty and Ruby go into the courtroom and Kirsty admits that she is the monster, not Tyrone. Ruby was taken to social services, Tyrone ended up back in his cell and Kirsty was arrested. She admitted everything to the police and Tyrone was discharged from the court, and Ruby is returned to him. Kirsty sees Tyrone and Fiz walking away with her baby while she is taken to prison. The next day, Kirsty wants to see Tyrone. He visits her and tells her not to contact him or Ruby ever again and that he's not scared of her anymore. Kirsty admits that she is the villain and says that she will get help, but Tyrone has heard it all before. He is sympathetic when Kirsty pours her heart out about changing her story for Ruby. Tyrone tells her that she'll always be Ruby's mother and that she'll always love her. Tyrone then leaves and Kirsty is escorted back to the prison cells. On 11 April 2014, Tyrone receives a call, saying that Kirsty has been released from prison. He later starts receiving anonymous text messages from an unknown person named \\"K\\". Tyrone believes that this is Kirsty but it is later revealed that the culprit was Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie), in a bid to try and reconcile her relationship with him. The police later reveal that the text messages came from within the United Kingdom, and that Kirsty no longer lives in the UK, but could not disclose her whereabouts for legal reasons. Creation Casting for Kirsty was announced on 8 July 2011 with Gumede winning the part. On being cast in the role Gumede said, \\"From the moment I read the script, I knew I was going to love playing Kirsty and I can't wait to see how the story unfolds\\" adding, \\"This is a dream role for me and I'm looking forward to creating a huge storm in Weatherfield\\". Gumede filmed her first scenes in early July. Kirsty was introduced as a love interest for Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall). While interviewed on This Morning series producer Phil Collinson said that Kirsty's arrival marked the start of a \\"big storyline\\" for Tyrone. He added that Tyrone's involvement with Kirsty would not be a \\"smooth ride\\". Development Kirsty's character was seen to be manipulative and controlling, and a pregnancy storyline was written for the character with Kirsty and Tyrone discovering in January 2012 after splitting up with each other. After the character's controlling behaviour was seen on- screen, it was confirmed in March 2012 that Kirsty and Tyrone would become the centre of a domestic violence storyline; with The Sun reporting that Kirsty would \\"begin psychologically abusing Tyrone, culminating in many vicious, violent attacks\\". Upon hearing of the abuse storyline, Gumede and co-star Alan Halsall researched male domestic abuse charities such as ManKind \\\\- that support male victims of domestic violence, in order to portray the storyline as realistically as possible. She later told the Daily Record that \\"there isn't much from the female abuser's point of view to read up on, it was really a case of thinking about it from the victim's point of view.\\" She later said that she found it hard and \\"draining\\" to film scenes where she attacked co- star Halsall, and that although \\"it was all camera tricks, the place I had to emotionally go to was quite ugly.\\" After attacking Tyrone a second time, Kirsty attempts to leave him fearing that she is a danger to him. In an interview with Digital Spy, Gumede explained that Kirsty's violence stemmed from her childhood. She revealed that \\"Kirsty had an abusive childhood. Her father hit her on a regular basis up until her 18th birthday, when she left home. The inference is that she's had very little contact with her family since then.\\" In June 2012, Gumede revealed that she was \\"terrified\\" at the prospect of filming scenes in which her character gave birth. She explained that \\"artificial baby bump makes filming difficult, especially in the warm sunshine\\" and that the upcoming scenes would provide a \\"further challenge in her career.\\" Gumede told the Anna Mansell from the Lancashire Telegraph that \\"it has been really interesting how people have said they felt sorry for her\\" and that \\"viewers are intrigued to see what happens next as it‚Äôs a really complex story for a complex character.\\" Kirsty gave birth to a daughter, who she and Tyrone named Ruby. After bringing Ruby home, Kirsty struggles to cope with being a mother and when the baby does not stop crying, she trashes the kitchen. The neighbours are forced to alert Tyrone to the situation and he rushes to stop Kirsty. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star reported that Tyrone considers running away with Ruby to protect her. On 21 February 2013, Gumede announced that she would be leaving Coronation Street. Gumede stated that she had been touched by the support of the viewers, saying \\"The last 18 months have been incredible, thank you all so much!\\" The actress filmed her final scenes as Kirsty during the week commencing 25 February. She shot her scenes along with fellow departing actress, Shobna Gulati, who played Sunita Alahan. Reception For her portrayal of Kirsty, Gumede received the Best Newcomer accolade at The British Soap Awards 2012. She was later nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the TVChoice Awards and Most Popular Newcomer at the 18th National Television Awards. Gumede won Best Bitch at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards. In Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Kirsty's domestic abuse storyline with Tyrone won Best Storyline with 28.3% of the vote. Inside Soap's Kate White commented \\"Hurrah for Corrie's Ker-azy Kirsty! She's as mad as a March Hare hiding under the Mad Hatter's maddest hat.\\" At The British Soap Awards 2013, Gumede won \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" and \\"Villain of the Year\\" for her portrayal of Kirsty. She also won \\"Best Storyline\\" at The British Soap Awards 2013, alongside Alan Halsall and Jennie McAlpine, with the nomination being named, \\"Kirsty's abuse of Tyrone\\".

Fish eyes are similar to the eyes of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Birds and mammals (including humans) normally adjust focus by changing the shape of their lens, but fish normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer to or further from the retina. Fish retinas generally have both rod cells and cone cells (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some are sensitive to polarized light. Among jawless fishes, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots.N. A. Campbell and J. B. Reece (2005). Biology, Seventh Edition. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, California. The ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one. Fish vision shows evolutionary adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fish have eyes suited to the dark environment. Water as a visual environment Fish and other aquatic animals live in a different light environment from that of terrestrial species. Water absorbs light so that with increasing depth the amount of light available decreases quickly. The optical properties of water also lead to different wavelengths of light being absorbed to different degrees. For example, visible light of long wavelengths (e.g. red, orange) is absorbed in less water than light of shorter wavelengths (green, blue). Ultraviolet light (even shorter wavelength than violet) can penetrate deeper than visual spectra Helfman et al, 2009, pp. 84-87. Besides these universal qualities of water, different bodies of water may absorb light of different wavelengths due to varying salt and/or chemical presence in the water. Structure and function Diagrammatic vertical section through the eye of teleost fish. Fish have a refractive index gradient within the lens which compensates for spherical aberration. Unlike humans, most fish adjust focus by moving the lens closer or further from the retina.Helfman et al, 2009, pp. 84-87. Teleosts do so by contracting the retractor lentis muscle. Humans adjust focus by changing the lens shape Fish eyes are broadly similar to those of other vertebrates ‚Äì notably the tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals ‚Äì all of which evolved from a fish ancestor). Light enters the eye at the cornea, passing through the pupil to reach the lens. Most fish species seem to have a fixed pupil size, but elasmobranches (like sharks and rays) have a muscular iris which allows pupil diameter to be adjusted. Pupil shape varies, and may be e.g. circular or slit-like. Lenses are normally spherical but can be slightly elliptical in some species. Compared to terrestrial vertebrates, fish lenses are generally more dense and spherical. In the aquatic environment there is not a major difference in the refractive index of the cornea and the surrounding water (compared to air on land) so the lens has to do the majority of the refraction. Due to \\"a refractive index gradient within the lens ‚Äî exactly as one would expect from optical theory\\", the spherical lenses of fish are able to form sharp images free from spherical aberration. Once light passes through the lens, it is transmitted through a transparent liquid medium until it reaches the retina, containing the photoreceptors. Like other vertebrates, the photoreceptors are on the inside layer so light must pass through layers of other neurons before it reaches them. The retina contains rod cells and cone cells. The retina Within the retina, rod cells provide high visual sensitivity (at the cost of acuity), being used in low light conditions. Cone cells provide higher spatial and temporal resolution than rods can, and allow for the possibility of colour vision by comparing absorbances across different types of cones which are more sensitive to different wavelengths. The ratio of rods to cones depends on the ecology of the fish species concerned, e.g., those mainly active during the day in clear waters will have more cones than those living in low light environments. Colour vision is more useful in environments with a broader range of wavelengths available, e.g., near the surface in clear waters rather than in deeper water where only a narrow band of wavelengths persist. The distribution of photoreceptors across the retina is not uniform. Some areas have higher densities of cone cells, for example (see fovea). Fish may have two or three areas specialized for high acuity (e.g. for prey capture) or sensitivity (e.g. from dim light coming from below). The distribution of photoreceptors may also change over time during development of the individual. This is especially the case when the species typically moves between different light environments during its life cycle (e.g. shallow to deep waters, or fresh water to ocean). or when food spectrum changes accompany the growth of a fish as seen with the Antarctic icefish Champsocephalus gunnari. Some species have a tapetum, a reflective layer which bounces light that passes through the retina back through it again. This enhances sensitivity in low light conditions, such as nocturnal and deep sea species, by giving photons a second chance to be captured by photoreceptors. However this comes at a cost of reduced resolution. Some species are able to effectively turn their tapetum off in bright conditions, with a dark pigment layer covering it as needed. The retina uses a lot of oxygen compared to most other tissues, and is supplied with plentiful oxygenated blood to ensure optimal performance. Humans have a vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. In a similar manner, fish have a vestibulo-ocular reflex which stabilizes visual images on the retina when it moves its tail.Singh H.R. and Khanna S.S. (1994) Advances in fish biology, p. 235, Hindustan Pub. . Accommodation Accommodation is the process by which the vertebrate eye adjusts focus on an object as it moves closer or further away. Whereas birds and mammals achieve accommodation by deforming the lens of their eyes, fish and amphibians normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer or further from the retina. They use a special muscle which changes the distance of the lens from the retina. In bony fishes the muscle is called the retractor lentis, and is relaxed for near vision, whereas for cartilaginous fishes the muscle is called the protractor lentis, and is relaxed for far vision. Thus bony fishes accommodate for distance vision by moving the lens closer to the retina, while cartilaginous fishes accommodate for near vision by moving the lens further from the retina.Schwab, Ivan R. (2012) Evolution's Witness: How Eyes Evolved Page 82. Oxford University Press. . Stabilising images There is a need for some mechanism that stabilises images during rapid head movements. This is achieved by the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is a reflex eye movement that stabilises images on the retina by producing eye movements in the direction opposite to head movements, thus preserving the image on the centre of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. In many animals, including human beings, the inner ear functions as the biological analogue of an accelerometer in camera image stabilization systems, to stabilize the image by moving the eyes. When a rotation of the head is detected, an inhibitory signal is sent to the extraocular muscles on one side and an excitatory signal to the muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Typical human eye movements lag head movements by less than 10 ms. The diagram on the right shows the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex circuitry in bony and cartilaginous fish. * \\"Goldfish\\" shows the principal three-neuronal vestibulo- ocular reflex linking the horizontal semicircular canal with contralateral abducens (ABD) and ipsilateral MR motoneurons. * \\"Flatfish\\" shows that after 90¬∞ displacement of the vestibular relative to visual axis (metamorphosis) compensatory eye movements are produced by redirecting horizontal canal signals to vertical and oblique motoneurons. * In \\"Shark\\" horizontal canal/second order neurons project to contralateral ABD and MR motoneurons including ipsilateral AI neurons. 1¬∞, first order vestibular neuron; ATD, Ascending Tract of Deiter's. Ultraviolet Fish vision is mediated by four visual pigments that absorb various wavelengths of light. Each pigment is constructed from a chromophore and the transmembrane protein, known as opsin. Mutations in opsin have allowed for visual diversity, including variation in wavelength absorption. A mutation of the opsin on the SWS-1 pigment allows some vertebrates to absorb UV light (‚âà360 nm), so they can see objects to reflect UV light. A wide range of fish species has developed and maintained this visual trait throughout evolution, suggesting it is advantageous. UV vision may be related to foraging, communication, and mate selection. The leading theory regarding the evolutionary selection of UV vision in select fish species is due to its strong role in mate selection. Behavioral experiments show that African cichlids utilize visual cues when choosing a mate. Their breeding sites are typically in shallow waters with high clarity and UV light penetration. Male African cichlids are largely a blue color that is reflective in UV light. Females are able to correctly choose a mate of their species when these reflective visual cues are present. This suggests that UV light detection is crucial for correct mate selection.Carleton, K.L., H√°rosi, F.I., & Kocher, T.D. (2000), Visual pigments of African cichlid fishes: Evidence for ultraviolet vision from microspectrophotometry and DNA sequences, Vision Research, 40(8), 879-890. UV reflective color patterns also enhance male attractiveness in guppies and three-spined sticklebacks. In experimental settings, female guppies spent significantly more time inspecting males with UV-reflective coloring than those with UV reflection blocked.Kodric-Brown, A., & Johnson, S.C. (2002). Ultraviolet reflectance patterns of male guppies enhance their attractiveness to females, Animal Behaviour, 63(2), 391-396. Similarly, female three-spined sticklebacks preferred males viewed in full spectrum over those viewed in UV blocking filters.Rick, I.P., Modarressie, R., & Bakker, T.C.M. (2006). UV wavelengths affect female mate choice in three-spined sticklebacks, Animal Behaviour, 71(2), 307-313. These results strongly suggest the role of UV detection in sexual selection and, thus, reproductive fitness. The prominent role of UV light detection in fish mate choice has allowed the trait to be maintained over time. UV vision may also be related to foraging and other communication behaviors. Many species of fish can see the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, beyond the violet. Ultraviolet vision is sometimes used during only part of the life cycle of a fish. For example, juvenile brown trout live in shallow water where they use ultraviolet vision to enhance their ability to detect zooplankton. As they get older, they move to deeper waters where there is little ultraviolet light. The two stripe damselfish, Dascyllus reticulatus, has ultraviolet-reflecting colouration which they appear to use as an alarm signal to other fish of their species. Predatory species cannot see this if their vision is not sensitive to ultraviolet. There is further evidence for this view that some fish use ultraviolet as a \\"high-fidelity secret communication channel hidden from predators\\", while yet other species use ultraviolet to make social or sexual signals. Polarized light It is not easy to establish whether a fish is sensitive to polarized light, though it appears likely in a number of taxa. It has been unambiguously demonstrated in anchovies.Horv√°th G and Varj√∫ D (2004) Polarized light in animal vision: polarization patterns in nature p. 294, Springer. . The ability to detect polarized light may provide better contrast and/or directional information for migrating species. Polarized light is most abundant at dawn and dusk. Polarized light reflected from the scales of a fish may enable other fish to better detect it against a diffuse background, and may provide useful information to schooling fish about their proximity and orientation relative to neighbouring fish. Double cones Most fish have double cones, a pair of cone cells joined to each other. Each member of the double cone may have a different peak absorbance, and behavioural evidence supports the idea that each type of individual cone in a double cone can provide separate information (i.e. the signal from individual members of the double cone are not necessarily summed together). Adaptation to habitat Fishes that live in surface waters down to about 200 metres, epipelagic fishes, live in a sunlit zone where visual predators use visual systems which are designed pretty much as might be expected. But even so, there can be unusual adaptations. Four-eyed fish have eyes raised above the top of the head and divided in two different parts, so that they can see below and above the water surface at the same time. Four-eyed fish actually have only two eyes, but their eyes are specially adapted for their surface-dwelling lifestyle. The eyes are positioned on the top of the head, and the fish floats at the water surface with only the lower half of each eye underwater. The two halves are divided by a band of tissue and the eye has two pupils, connected by part of the iris. The upper half of the eye is adapted for vision in air, the lower half for vision in water. The lens of the eye changes in thickness top to bottom to account for the difference in the refractive indices of air versus water. These fish spend most of their time at the surface of the water. Their diet mostly consists of the terrestrial insects which are available at the surface. Mesopelagic fishes live in deeper waters, in the twilight zone down to depths of 1000 metres, where the amount of sunlight available is not sufficient to support photosynthesis. These fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most of them are visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light signals.Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 585 This adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them. For more sensitive vision in low light, some fish have a retroreflector behind the retina. Flashlight fish have this plus photophores, which they use in combination to detect eyeshine in other fish.McCosker JE (1977) \\"Flashlight fishes\\" Scientific American, 236: 106‚Äì115. Still deeper down the water column, below 1000 metres, are found the bathypelagic fishes. At this depth the ocean is pitch black, and the fish are sedentary, adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food and no sunlight. Bioluminescence is the only light available at these depths. This lack of light means the organisms have to rely on senses other than vision. Their eyes are small and may not function at all.Ryan P \\"Deep-sea creatures: The bathypelagic zone\\" Te Ara ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Updated 21 September 2007.Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 587 File:Dmawsoni Head shot.jpgDeepwater fishes, like this Antarctic toothfish, often have large, upward looking eyes, adapted to detect prey silhouetted against the gloom above. File:gigantura chuni.pngThe telescopefish has large, forward-pointing telescoping eyes with large lenses. File:Coccorella atrata.pngThe mesopelagic sabertooth is an ambush predator with telescopic, upward-pointing eyes. At the very bottom of the ocean flatfish can be found. Flatfish are benthic fish with a negative buoyancy so they can rest on the seafloor. Although flatfish are bottom dwellers, they are not usually deep sea fish, but are found mainly in estuaries and on the continental shelf. When flatfish larvae hatch they have the elongated and symmetric shape of a typical bony fish. The larvae do not dwell on the bottom, but float in the sea as plankton. Eventually they start metamorphosing into the adult form. One of the eyes migrates across the top of the head and onto the other side of the body, leaving the fish blind on one side. The larva loses its swim bladder and spines, and sinks to the bottom, laying its blind side on the underlying surface. Richard Dawkins explains this as an example of evolutionary adaptation > ...bony fish as a rule have a marked tendency to be flattened in a vertical > direction.... It was natural, therefore, that when the ancestors of > [flatfish] took to the sea bottom, they should have lain on one side.... But > this raised the problem that one eye was always looking down into the sand > and was effectively useless. In evolution this problem was solved by the > lower eye ‚Äòmoving‚Äô round to the upper side. File:Malacosteus.JPGMost deep-sea fish cannot see red light. The deepwater stoplight loosejaw produces red bioluminescence so it can hunt with an effectively invisible beam of light. File:Pseudopleuronectes americanus.jpgWhen the larvae of a flatfish grows, the eye on one side rotates to the other side so the fish can rest on the seafloor File:Auge einer Scholle.JPGThe European plaice is a flatfish with raised eyes, so when it buries itself in sand for camouflage it can still see Prey usually have eyes on the sides of their head so they have a large field of view, from which to avoid predators. Predators usually have eyes in front of their head so they have better depth perception. Benthic predators, like flatfish, have eyes arranged so they have a binocular view of what is above them as they lie on the bottom. Coloration Fish have evolved sophisticated ways of using colouration. For example, prey fish have ways of using colouration to make it more difficult for visual predators to see them. In pelagic fish, these adaptations are mainly concerned with a reduction in silhouette, a form of camouflage. One method of achieving this is to reduce the area of their shadow by lateral compression of the body. Another method, also a form of camouflage, is by countershading in the case of epipelagic fish and by counter- illumination in the case of mesopelagic fish. Countershading is achieved by colouring the fish with darker pigments at the top and lighter pigments at the bottom in such a way that the colouring matches the background. When seen from the top, the darker dorsal area of the animal blends into the darkness of the water below, and when seen from below, the lighter ventral area blends into the sunlight from the surface. Counter illumination is achieved via bioluminescence by the production of light from ventral photophores, aimed at matching the light intensity from the underside of the fish with the light intensity from the background.Countershading BBC: Science and Nature. Retrieved 28 September 2011. Benthic fish, which rest on the seafloor, physically hide themselves by burrowing into sand or retreating into nooks and crannies, or camouflage themselves by blending into the background or by looking like a rock or piece of seaweed.Fishy friends and fishy foes Preparation manual, Long Beach Marine Institute. While these tools may be effective as predator avoidance mechanisms, they also serve as equally effective tools for the predators themselves. For example, the deepwater velvet belly lantern shark uses counter-illumination to hide from its prey. File:Bluefin-big.jpgEpipelagic fish, like this Atlantic bluefin tuna, are typically countershaded with silvery colours File:Chaetodon capistratus1.jpgThe foureye butterflyfish has false eyes on its back end, confusing predators about which is the front end of the fish File:John Dory drawing.jpg The John Dory has a large eye spot in the middle of its body, confusing prey Some fish species also display false eyespots. The foureye butterflyfish gets its name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of each side of the body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eyespot. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.FishBase This can result in a predator thinking the fish is bigger than it is, and confusing the back end with the front end. The butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eyespot closer to the predator than the head. Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eyespot tricks the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. The John Dory is a benthopelagic coastal fish with a high laterally compressed body. Its body is so thin that it can hardly be seen from the front. It also has a large dark spot on both sides, which is used to flash an \\"evil eye\\" if danger approaches. The large eyes at the front of the head provide it with the bifocal vision and depth perception it needs to catch prey. The John Dory's eye spot on the side of its body also confuses prey, which is then sucked into its mouth.Walrond, Carl (2006) Coastal fish - Fish of the open sea floor, Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 28 May 2019. Barreleyes Barreleyes are a family of small, unusual-looking mesopelagic fishes, named for their barrel-shaped, tubular eyes which are generally directed upwards to detect the silhouettes of available prey. Barreleyes have large, telescoping eyes which dominate and protrude from the skull. These eyes generally gaze upwards, but can also be swivelled forwards in some species. Their eyes have a large lens and a retina with an exceptional number of rod cells and a high density of rhodopsin (the \\"visual purple\\" pigment); there are no cone cells. The barreleye species, Macropinna microstoma, has a transparent protective dome over the top of its head, somewhat like the dome over an airplane cockpit, through which the lenses of its eyes can be seen. The dome is tough and flexible, and presumably protects the eyes from the nematocysts (stinging cells) of the siphonophores from which it is believed the barreleye steals food.Researchers solve mystery of deep-sea fish with tubular eyes and transparent head Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, 23 February 2009. Another barreleye species, the brownsnout spookfish, is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror, as opposed to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes.Smith, L. (Jan. 8, 2009). \\"Fish with four eyes can see through the deep sea gloom\\". Times Online. Times Newspapers Ltd. Retrieved on March 14, 2009. It is unusual in that it utilizes both refractive and reflective optics to see. The main tubular eye contains a lateral ovoid swelling called a diverticulum, largely separated from the eye by a septum. The retina lines most of the interior of the eye, and there are two corneal openings, one directed up and the other down, that allow light into the main eye and the diverticulum respectively. The main eye employs a lens to focus its image, as in other fishes. However, inside the diverticulum the light is reflected and focused onto the retina by a curved composite mirror derived from the retinal tapetum, composed of many layers of small reflective plates possibly made of guanine crystals. The split structure of the brownsnout spookfish eye allows the fish to see both up and down at the same time. In addition, the mirror system is superior to a lens in gathering light. It is likely that the main eye serves to detect objects silhouetted against the sunlight, while the diverticulum serves to detect bioluminescent flashes from the sides and below. Sharks Eye of a bigeyed sixgill shark Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection. Other examples schooling together, small fish provide many eyes as a precaution against ambush, and can visually confuse predators if they do attack Small fish often school together for safety. This can have visual advantages, both by visually confusing predator fishes, and by providing many eyes for the school regarded as a body. The \\"predator confusion effect\\" is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel. \\"Shoaling fish are the same size and silvery, so it is difficult for a visually oriented predator to pick an individual out of a mass of twisting, flashing fish and then have enough time to grab its prey before it disappears into the shoal.\\"Moyle and Cech, 2004. The \\"many eyes effect\\" is based on the idea that as the size of the group increases, the task of scanning the environment for predators can be spread out over many individuals, a mass collaboration presumably providing a higher level of vigilance. Fish are normally cold-blooded, with body temperatures the same as the surrounding water. However, some oceanic predatory fish, such as swordfish and some shark and tuna species, can warm parts of their body when they hunt for prey in deep and cold water. The highly visual swordfish uses a heating system involving its muscles which raises the temperature in its eyes and brain by up to 15 ¬∞C. The warming of the retina improves the rate at which the eyes respond to changes in rapid motion made by its prey by as much as ten times.Helfman et al, 2009, pp. 95‚Äì97. Some fish have eyeshine. Eyeshine is the result of a light-gathering layer in the eyes called the tapetum lucidum, which reflects white light. It does not occur in humans, but can be seen in other species, such as deer in a headlight. Eyeshine allows fish to see well in low-light conditions as well as in turbid (stained or rough, breaking) waters, giving them an advantage over their prey. This enhanced vision allows fish to populate the deeper regions in the ocean or a lake. In particular, freshwater walleye are so named because their eyeshine.Johnson JA and Esser R (2009) \\"http://www.fishculturesection.org/Aquanotes/pdf/Aq_App_Note_1_April_2009.pdf Walleye Culture ‚Äì Habituation to Feed in the Dark\\" American Fisheries Society, Aquaculture Application Note. Many species of Loricariidae, a family of catfish, have a modified iris called an omega iris. The top part of the iris descends to form a loop which can expand and contract called an iris operculum; when light levels are high, the pupil reduces in diameter and the loop expands to cover the center of the pupil giving rise to a crescent shaped light transmitting portion. This feature gets its name from its similarity to an upside-down Greek letter omega (Œ©). The origins of this structure are unknown, but it has been suggested that breaking up the outline of the highly visible eye aids camouflage in what are often highly mottled animals. Distance sensory systems Blind cavefish find their way around by means of lateral lines, which are highly sensitive to changes in water pressure. Visual systems are distance sensory systems which provide fish with data about location or objects at a distance without a need for the fish to directly touch them. Such distance sensing systems are important, because they allow communication with other fish, and provide information about the location of food and predators, and about avoiding obstacles or maintaining position in fish schools. For example, some schooling species have \\"schooling marks\\" on their sides, such as visually prominent stripes which provide reference marks and help adjacent fish judge their relative positions.Bone & Moore, 2008, pp. 418‚Äì422. But the visual system is not the only one that can perform such functions. Some schooling fish also have a lateral line running the length of their bodies. This lateral line enables the fish to sense changes in water pressure and turbulence adjacent to its body. Using this information, schooling fish can adjust their distance from adjacent fish if they come too close or stray too far. The visual system in fish is augmented by other sensing systems with comparable or complementary functions. Some fish are blind, and must rely entirely on alternate sensing systems.Bone & Moore, 2008, p. 311. Other senses which can also provide data about location or distant objects include hearing and echolocation, electroreception, magnetoception and chemoreception (smell and taste). For example, catfish have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they \\"taste\\" anything they touch and \\"smell\\" any chemicals in the water. \\"In catfish, gustation plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food\\".Atema, Jelle (1980) \\"Chemical senses, chemical signals, and feeding behavior in fishes\\" p. 57‚Äì101. In: Bardach, JE Fish behavior and its use in the capture and culture of fishes', The WorldFish Center, . Cartilaginous fish (sharks, stingrays and chimaeras) use magnetoception. They possess special electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini which detect a slight variation in electric potential. These receptors, located along the mouth and nose of the fish, operate according to the principle that a time-varying magnetic field moving through a conductor induces an electric potential across the ends of the conductor. The ampullae may also allow the fish to detect changes in water temperature. As in birds, magnetoception may provide information which help the fish map migration routes.

Hosseini received his PhD in English from Washington University, Seattle in the United States. Having completed his tertiary education in his hometown, he continued his education at Shiraz University in Iran where he graduated with an M.A in English literature. Then he went to the United States, earning a PhD degree in English literature at Washington University, after which he came back to Iran in 1979. He was acclaimed by the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Guidance as the leading translator and critic of the year in 1997. (1376 Hijri) Hosseini's vast knowledge of Persian literature especially the works of Hafiz and the Modern Persian poets such as Sohrab Sepehri and his long association with notable literary figures such as Manucher Badiyee; Houshang Golshiri ; Feraidun Moshiri; Houshang Golshiri ;Ahmad Shamlu and other notable figures of Iran's literary society has resulted in him being one of the popular critics of Modern Iranian poetry and one of the advocates of the Persian language which is manifest in his translations. Hosseini's translations have been criticized as being too ponderous for the common reader; whereas being works of literature in their original form, Hosseini has always defended his unique translations with the statement that he has striven to create \\" an equivalent literary masterpiece in Persian\\" while remaining faithful to the original work. Among his notable works are1984 by George Orwell and the introduction of Brave New World translated into Persian by Sa‚Äôid Hamidian. He also translated To the Lighthouse (Virginia Woolf) and Heart of Darkness (Joseph Conrad) which are both great in source language and translated target language.

Life Hans Christian Lyngbye was born in Aalborg, Denmark, in 1782, the son of a teacher, Jens Michelsen Lyngbye. He attended the Latin school in Aalborg until 1802 when he took as his tutor a priest on the island of Vendsyssel. He studied botany and theology and graduated in 1812. He then worked with the botanist Niels Hofman Bang which awoke his interest in algae. He won a competition set by the University of Copenhagen and as a result, Hornemann paid for the printing of his work on algae, Tentamen Hydrophytologi√¶ Danica, which was published in 1819. It contained meticulous descriptions of 321 species of marine algae with illustrations of 70, including 7 new genera and 50 new species, and raised awareness of the algal flora of Denmark, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.Hans Christian Lyngbye He visited the Faroe Islands in 1817 and wrote a treatise on pilot whales and whaling. He was also fascinated by the old Faroese fables and ballads and made a collection of them, going so far as to learn the old Faroese language in order to be able to write them down. One of these was Loka T√°ttur, a rare depiction of Norse gods in folklore. From 1819, he worked as a priest, first at Gjesing and N√∏rager and later on the coast at S√∏borg and Gilleleje. Here he was able to pursue his studies of seaweed.Lyngbye, Hans Christian In 1836, he wrote a dissertation for a doctorate degree, but it remained forgotten in the pocket of the cloak worn by the messenger conveying it to the University of Copenhagen and it missed the deadline. He died the following year. The botanical part of the thesis was published in 1879. The genus of blue-green algae, Lyngbya, was named in his honour.

He won the Irish St. Leger for four years in succession (2001‚Äì2004) and was named European Champion Stayer in the Cartier Racing Awards for 2002. He also became known internationally for his three attempts to win the Melbourne Cup in which he finished fourth, second and eighth. He was officially rated the best stayer in the world on three occasions (2002, 2003, 2004). He was retired from racing in 2005 and is currently at stud in Templemore Co. Tipperary (Ireland) Background Vinnie Roe was bred in County Tipperary, Ireland by Virginia Moeran. As a son of the National Stakes winner Definite Article, he is a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Aside from Vinnie Roe, Definite Article has sired the winners of more than four hundred races including the Geoffrey Freer Stakes winner Lochbuie and a large number winners under National Hunt rules. Through Definite Article, Vinnie Roe is inbred to the Champion Stakes winner Lorenzaccio (see below). Vinnie Roe's dam Kayu, an unraced twin, was a successful broodmare, producing at least five other winners. As a foal, Vinnie Roe was sent to the Goffs November sale and bought for 48,000 gns. A year later, he was sent to the Goffs Orby sale, where he was sold for IR¬£50,000 to Dermot Weld on behalf of the film director Jim Sheridan, who named the horse after his nephew. Sheridan owned the horse in partnership with Antonio Balzarini, and over the course of his career, Vinnie Roe was variously described as being owned by Sheridan, Balzarini or both. Vinnie Roe was trained throughout his racing career by Dermot Weld at the Curragh and was ridden in all but one of his races by Pat Smullen. He was an easily recognisable runner, usually racing in blinkers and a sheepskin noseband. Because of the differences in breeding seasons between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Australian sources often describe Vinnie Roe as being a year older than his \\"official\\" age. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Vinnie Roe made a winning debut in a maiden race at Leopardstown in June, staying on strongly to get up on the line and beat the filly Affianced by a head. In October, he was stepped up to Group Three class and finished third behind two Aidan O'Brien-trained runners in the Beresford Stakes at The Curragh. On his final start of the year, he returned to Leopardstown to record his first important win in the Listed Eyrefield Stakes, beating the future Tattersalls Gold Cup winner Rebelline by one and a half lengths. =2001: three-year-old season= Vinnie Roe was campaigned over middle distances in the early part of his three-year-old season. He finished behind Galileo in the Ballysax Stakes, the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and the Irish Derby and was also sent to Rome, where he finished fourth to Morshdi in the Derby Italiano. He was then moved up to staying (Extended) distances and was unbeaten in his remaining four races. Three weeks after his run in the Irish Derby, he was driven clear in the closing stages to win the Listed Challenge Stakes at Leopardstown by four lengths. A month later, he stayed on to take the Ballycullen Stakes at the Curragh by a head from the John Oxx-trained favourite Pugin, who was receiving three pounds. The race illustrated Vinnie Roe's aptitude for longer distances, as Pugin had finished three lengths in front of him at level weights in the Irish Derby. In the Irish St. Leger in September, he faced a strong field headed by the 2000 English St Leger winner Millenary, the future Arc winner Marienbard and the double Champion Stayer Persian Punch. Pat Smullen held up Vinnie Roe in the early stages as Persian Punch set the pace from Millenary before making his challenge in the straight. Millenary took the lead, but Smullen brought Vinnie Roe through to overtake him inside the final furlong and win by two lengths. Vinnie Roe was then sent to Longchamp for the Prix Royal-Oak and secured his second successive Group One win, this time over two miles. Smullen took him into the lead two furlongs out and he won by two and a half lengths, despite hanging to the right in the closing stages. Dermot Weld decided not to send Vinnie Roe for the Melbourne Cup in 2001, as he believed that the journey would be too difficult for the three-year-old. =2002: four-year-old season= Vinnie Roe began 2002 by taking his fifth race in succession, winning the Listed Saval Beg Stakes \\"easily\\" by four lengths. He was then sent to race in England for the first time and was made favourite for the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup. He made a strong challenge in the straight to briefly take the lead, but although he stayed on \\"gamely\\" he was headed again in the closing stages and beaten a neck by the gelding Royal Rebel in what the BBC described as a \\"thrilling\\" race. Two months later, he won the Listed Ballyroan Stakes at Leopardstown, holding off Millstreet by half a length while carrying a weight of 10-0 (140 pounds). In September, he won his second Irish St. Leger, beating Pugin by one and a half lengths, with Millenary and Warrsan among the beaten horses. After the race, Dermot Weld called him \\"a very brave horse, one of the toughest I have ever trained.\\" Vinnie Roe was then sent to Australia for the Melbourne Cup. He was allotted a weight of 59 kg, three kilograms more than any other runner, but was nevertheless made favourite at 9/2. According to The Age, he was the \\"centre of attention\\" before the race and impressed observers including Bart Cummings with a \\"brilliant\\" exercise gallop. In the race, he settled well and was moved up to take the lead two furlongs out, but was then challenged and overtaken by his stable companion Media Puzzle. He ran on under pressure, but was passed by Mr Prudent and Beekeeper in the closing stages to finish fourth. Weld described the performance as \\"a big run on a track that was too firm for him\\" and added, \\"he'll be back.\\" =2003: five-year-old season= After his run in Melbourne, Vinnie Roe was off the course for nine months. He returned in August 2003 to win his second Ballyroan Stakes, winning by a head from Carpanetto, who was receiving seventeen pounds. In his attempt to win a third Irish St. Leger, he was opposed by five runners including the English St Leger winner Bollin Eric and the improving Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old Powerscourt. Vinnie Roe was sent into the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and stayed on to win by a length from the English four- year-old Gamut. Although there was much speculation about a return to Australia, Vinnie Roe was sent to Paris, rather than Melbourne, for his remaining two starts of 2003. He moved back down to one and a half miles for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and finished fifth behind Dalakhani, then was fourth to Westerner when favourite for the Prix Royal-Oak. =2004: six-year- old season= In the Saval Beg Stakes, the outsider Windermere was allowed to open up a huge lead (\\"a furlong\\" according to RT√â), and Vinnie Roe, the odds- on favourite, was only able to close the gap to four and a half lengths by the finish. In August, he stayed on strongly in the closing stages of the Ballyroan Stakes but was beaten a neck by the English-trained Foreign Affairs. In the Irish St. Leger, which was run in cold, wet conditions, he was made 7/2 joint favourite with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Brian Boru the winner of the 2003 English St Leger. Smullen tracked the leaders before moving into the lead at the start of the straight. Vinnie Roe went clear and stayed on through driving rain to win by two and a half lengths. His performance was greeted with loud applause throughout the final furlong and he was given a \\"hero's welcome\\" as he returned to the winner's enclosure. Smullen commented that Vinnie Roe had \\"annihilated them\\" and that \\"he loves it when there is a bit of cut in the ground.\\" He returned to Flemington for a second attempt at the Melbourne Cup in November and, as in 2002, he was given top weight. On this occasion, he was given 58 kg, which required him to give at least 2.5 kg to the rest of the field, which included the 2003 winner Makybe Diva. Before the race, Weld expressed concern that the conditions would be too firm but decided to run after heavy rainfall softened the ground. Smullen produced Vinnie Roe with a strong run in the straight and took him into the lead a furlong out, but he was almost immediately overtaken by Makybe Diva racing on the inside and finished second, beaten by one and a quarter lengths. After the race, Weld said that the conditions had been ideal for his horse but that \\"the weight just caught him out.\\" =2005: seven-year-old season= Vinnie Roe began 2005 by winning a second Saval Beg Stakes at the Curragh in May before being sent to England for a second attempt at the Gold Cup, run that year at York as Ascot was being renovated. He ran prominently but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished third of the seventeen runners behind Westerner. Both Weld and Smullen felt that the two and a half mile distance had been slightly too far for Vinnie Roe. He finished third in the Ballyroan Stakes and then attempted to win a fifth Irish St. Leger, despite having his preparation interrupted by a minor injury. He took the lead in the straight but could find no extra in the closing stages and finished third, beaten a length behind the English challengers Collier Hill and The Whistling Teal. On his final start, Vinnie Roe made a third attempt at the Melbourne Cup. Again he was given top weight, although on this occasion he was joined on 58 kg by Makybe Diva. His task was made more difficult after he endured a \\"nightmare\\" journey, having to receive veterinary treatment for colic on the flight and there were the usual fears about the possibility of firm ground. In the race, he was settled in the middle of the field before staying on strongly in the straight, but could never reach the leaders and finished eighth of the twenty-four runners. After the race, Smullen, who knew that it would be Vinnie Roe's last run, said that the horse \\"ran his heart out\\" and that it was \\"the end of an era.\\" Before his run at Flemington, Vinnie Roe was bought by the Coolmore, and after the race he was retired to his new owners' stud. Assessment In the 2001 International Classification, Vinnie Roe was rated the third best horse in the world in the Extended distance division with a rating of 120.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc02/EndMaterial2002.pdf A year later, he was rated the best horse in the world in the Extended distance division with a rating of 120.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc03/EndMaterial2003.pdf and was named European Champion Stayer in the 2002 Cartier Racing Awards. In the 2003 and 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Vinnie Roe was rated the equal-best horse in the world in the Extended distance division with a rating of 119.http://www.horseracingintfed.com/resources/Ratings_All_04.pdfhttp://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc05/2005WorldRankings.pdf In 2005, he was rated the fifth best horse in the world in the Extended distance division with a rating of 116.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc06/2006WorldRankings.pdf Stud career Vinnie Roe stands as a stallion at Longford House Stud in Templemore Co.Tipperary. He is marketed as a National Hunt sire with a stud fee for 2016 ‚Ç¨3000 Pedigree * Through his sire Definite Article, Vinnie Roe is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Lorenzaccio. This means that Lorenzaccio appears in two separate place in the fourth generation of his pedigree. Lorenzaccio is best known for his defeat of Nijinsky in the 1970 Champion Stakes.

The series consists of twenty five films produced by Eon Productions featuring the James Bond character, a fictional British Secret Service agent. The most recent instalment is the 2015 film Spectre, which was released in UK cinemas on 26 October 2015. There have also been two independently made features, the satirical Casino Royale, released in 1967, and the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. Whilst each element has not appeared in every Bond film, they are common threads that run through most of the films. These motifs vary from integral plot points, such as the assignment briefing sessions or the attempts to kill Bond, to enhancements of the dramatic narrative, such as music, or aspects of the visual style, such as the title sequences. These motifs may also serve to enhance excitement in the plot, through a chase sequence or for the climax of the film. Some of these‚Äîsuch as \\"Bond girls\\" or megalomaniac villains‚Äîhave been present in all of the stories, whilst others‚Äîsuch as Q's gadgets or the role of M‚Äîhave changed over time, often to shape or follow the contemporary zeitgeist. These elements are formulaic and the Bond films tend to follow a set pattern with only limited variety, often following within a strict order. A number of the elements were altered or removed in 2006 with the reboot of the series, Casino Royale. Some of the elements involved are a result of the production crew used in the earliest films in the series, with the work of Ken Adam, the original production designer, Maurice Binder, title designer, and John Barry, composer, continually updated and adapted as the series progressed. Opening sequences =Gun barrel sequence= The alt=The figure of silhouetted man points a gun straight at the camera. All of the Eon Bond films feature the unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, which has been called by British media historian James Chapman \\"the trademark motif of the series\\". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through the barrel of a gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual .38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the \\"James Bond Theme\\", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes. After Maurice Binder's death in 1991, Daniel Kleinman was responsible for the gun barrel sequence up to and including Casino Royale. Design house MK12 supervised the graphics for Quantum of Solace. Chapman has suggested that the sequence is a significant part of the James Bond mythos because it \\"foregrounds the motif of looking\\" that is central to the spy film genre. The gun barrel imagery sometimes carried over to the film posters used to promote Bond films, including as a familiarising element on the introduction of Timothy Dalton for The Living Daylights. The sequence was traditionally placed at the start of each film until the 2006 instalment Casino Royale, where it appears after the cold open and is incorporated into the plot; in the 2008 film, Quantum of Solace, the sequence was placed at the end of the film and incorporates the film's title in its design. For Skyfall, director Sam Mendes had wanted to return the gun barrel to the start of the film but in editing realised that the sequence was similar to his opening shot of the film. Because of this, the sequence was placed at the end of the film fading into a 50th Anniversary logo. In Spectre the sequence returns to the start of the film and also returns to the classic Binder design. This time the barrel fades into a title card that reads \\"The Dead Are Alive\\" (a sentence which seems to be explicated by the fact that the picture starts during the Day of the Dead, but can be later explicated by the presence of the seemingly deceased character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld). =Pre-title sequence= In the first film of the series, Dr. No, the gun barrel sequence is followed by the main titles, but starting with From Russia with Love and in all subsequent films, the titles are preceded by a pre-title sequence or \\"teaser\\". The contents of the sequence can relate to the main plot of the film in a number of ways, including being not at all related (as in Goldfinger), loosely connected (as with The World Is Not Enough) or fully related to the plot (as can be seen in Licence to Kill and On Her Majesty's Secret Service). From Thunderball through to Die Another Day, the gun barrel sequence segues into the pre-title sequence by having the opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is two to three times the length of most others. =Title sequence= alt=A woman's body with \\"Starring Sean Connery\\" projected on it; women alongside a cocktail glass with the Union Jack in it with \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" written underneath; a woman's open eyes and red smoke, with \\"Live and Let Die\\" written over the image; and a diamond necklace with \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" written over it The main title sequences incorporate visual elements that often reflect each film's theme, often showing silhouettes of nude or provocatively clad women set against swirling images. For example, the 1965 film Thunderball features scenes of deep-sea diving and this is reflected in the associated opening sequence; similarly the opening sequence for the 1964 film Goldfinger shows clips from Bond films projected onto the gold-painted silhouette of actress Margaret Nolan: the titles have been described by Bond scholars Smith and Lavington as \\"Gorgeous, iconic, seminal.\\" The concept for the titles came from designer Robert Brownjohn, who worked on From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, before he fell out with producer Harry Saltzman and left the series. In creating the titles, Brownjohn was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema; he was also influenced by constructivist artist L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy projecting light on to clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn also used the effect in the poster he created for Goldfinger. Designer Maurice Binder, who had worked on the first Bond film, Dr. No, had been unable to work on either From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but returned for Thunderball, where he retained Brownjohn's concept for the titles. Binder eventually worked on thirteen Bond films and after his death in 1991, the opening credits were done by Daniel Kleinman. This changed for Quantum of Solace, with the studio MK12 taking control. Kleinman returned to direct the Skyfall title sequence, and the title sequence for Spectre. A contemporary artist usually sings during the title sequence and an instrumental version of the main track may also be featured as a leitmotif during the film, which repeats in various moods. Writing for Rolling Stone, Andy Greene says that \\"James Bond title songs, as a rule, have the name of the movie in the chorus,\\" though he notes that this is not always the case. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has an entirely instrumental credit sequence, though the film features an alternate theme, \\"We Have All the Time in the World\\", sung by Louis Armstrong. Until the Daniel Craig era, only \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" and \\"All Time High\\" served as an opening theme without sharing a title with the movie. John Barry provided the title song music on ten of the eleven films for which he composed the musical score. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song and become pop hits, including Paul McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die\\", Carly Simon's \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" (for the film The Spy Who Loved Me), and Sheena Easton's \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" with Adele's \\"Skyfall\\" and Sam Smith's \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" eventually winning the award. Plot elements =Flirting with Moneypenny= alt=Sean Connery and Roger Moore alongside Lois Maxwell, Pierce Brosnan with Samantha Bond and Timothy Dalton with Caroline Bliss; an office filled with paintings is behind Connery, Moore and Brosnan, while a lab is behind Dalton With the exception of the first two Daniel Craig films, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, every Bond film has a sequence in which Bond interacts with Miss Moneypenny, the personal assistant to M, Bond's superior. Lois Maxwell was the first to portray Moneypenny and did so for fourteen Eon-produced Bond films from Dr. No in 1962 to A View to a Kill in 1985 opposite Connery, Lazenby, and Moore. She was followed by Caroline Bliss, Samantha Bond and Naomie Harris, who played opposite Dalton, Brosnan and Craig respectively. The four have arguably divergent interpretations of Moneypenny's personality, as do the six actors who have played Bond. A running joke throughout the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and a wedding ring out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine. =Receiving assignment from M= Judi Dench has played M seven times, the only woman in a role previously played by two men in the Eon films. Early in most plots Bond is called in to see M, the head of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond receives the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued state of agitation over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions. The first actor to portray M was Bernard Lee, who appeared in all eleven Bond films from Dr. No in 1962 to Moonraker in 1979. With Lee's illness from stomach cancer in 1980‚Äì1981, he was unable to appear in his scenes for For Your Eyes Only; he died on 16 January 1981 and, out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role for the film. Instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence. Lee was replaced for four films between 1983 and 1989, by Robert Brown who had previously appeared in the series as Admiral Hargreaves. Judi Dench took over the role of M from 1995's GoldenEye until 2012's Skyfall. In Skyfall, Gareth Mallory, played by Ralph Fiennes, takes over as M at the end of the film after the death of Dench's character. In the books, \\"Universal Export\\" (later \\"Transworld Corporation\\") serves as a cover for the British Secret Service. In the films, \\"Universal Exports\\" or variations thereof are used, such as the abbreviation \\"UnivEx\\" in From Russia with Love, a brass name plate in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and Bond's helicopter in For Your Eyes Only. Academic Paul Stock argues that M's office‚Äîand Universal Exports by extension‚Äîis a metonym for England, whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness. =Technical briefing with Q= Desmond Llewelyn played Q seventeen times, the only actor to play opposite five different Bonds. After getting his assignment, Bond is often sent to Q Branch for the technical briefing in which he receives special equipment to be used in his mission. The pre-mission briefings quickly became one of the motifs that ran through the Bond series. Dr. No provided no spy-related gadgets, although a Geiger counter was used. Industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attach√© case shown in From Russia with Love, which he described as \\"a classic 007 product\\". The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film Goldfinger and the film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films. Starting with From Russia with Love, the briefings with Q branch involve various gadgets and technology, although Boothroyd is not referred to in the credits as Q until the third film, Goldfinger. Each Bond film thereafter up until Die Another Day contains a technical briefing of some kind, usually given by Q, with the exception of Live and Let Die, in which Q does not appear and On Her Majesty's Secret Service in which Q does not brief 007 but is demonstrating to M. Q is sometimes shown joining Bond in the field, taking with him a portable workshop and his staff. These workshops are established in unusual locations, such as an Egyptian tomb in The Spy Who Loved Me and a South American monastery in Moonraker. On three occasions, in Octopussy, Licence to Kill and Spectre, Q takes active roles in Bond's missions. For the 2006 Casino Royale reboot and the subsequent instalment, Quantum of Solace, the character of Q was, like Moneypenny, dropped, and although Bond still receives a supply of mission equipment, no technical briefing is shown on screen. The technical briefings resume, under the tutelage of Q, in Skyfall and Spectre. There are several running jokes throughout the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how his equipment is often lost, damaged or destroyed by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is in the lab (\\"Now pay attention\\") as Q rattles off details about the use of the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response (\\"I never joke about my work\\"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes full advantage of the tools supplied. Desmond Llewelyn played Q in seventeen Bond films, appearing in more Bond films than any other actor, where he worked with the first five James Bond actors. Llewelyn's first film was the second in the Eon series, From Russia with Love, after the actor who played the part in Dr. No, Peter Burton, was unavailable for the filming schedule. (Burton's character was not yet called Q, but \\"the Armourer\\", Major Boothroyd, who instructed Bond on a new firearm, the Walther PPK.) After appearing as Q's assistant in The World Is Not Enough, John Cleese appeared as Q in Pierce Brosnan's last film, Die Another Day. For Daniel Craig's third film, Skyfall, the character was re-introduced, with Ben Whishaw playing the part. =Guns, cars and aircraft= ;Guns The first Bond film, Dr. No, saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which the film Bond used in eighteen films. Since Tomorrow Never Dies, Bond's main weapon has been the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol. The alt=A silver vintage car ;Cars Bond has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citro√´n 2CV to an AEC Regent III RT bus, amongst others. Bond's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in Goldfinger; it later featured in Thunderball, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, Casino Royale, Skyfall, Spectre, and No Time to Die. The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,090,000 to an unnamed European collector. The features of the original DB5, as featured in Goldfinger, included an ejection passenger seat, operated by a pushbutton concealed in the shift lever; a metal pop-up shield in the rear; rotating licence plates; an on-demand oil slick; rotating blades concealed in each wheel hub that could be extended to shred an enemy's tyres; and a tracking device, with a dash-mounted display, that predated the modern GPS tracker. Some features were referenced in later films, such as Skyfall, in which M (Judi Dench) asked Bond, What are you going to do, eject me? ;Aircraft Bond also shows his taste for aircraft: a gyrocopter‚ÄîLittle Nellie‚Äîfeatures in You Only Live Twice, a Cessna 185 Seaplane in Licence to Kill, an Acrostar Jet in Octopussy, the Space Shuttle in Moonraker and an Aero L-39 Albatros in Tomorrow Never Dies. =Meeting allies= Once in the field, Bond frequently meets up with a local ally upon arrival. These can be his foreign counterparts like Tiger Tanaka in Japan or CIA operatives like Felix Leiter, or his own staff in a secret location. Such characters can also be female, some of whom succumb to Bond's charms. Often these allies will provide Bond either with information to complete his mission, or with additional gadgets from Q. Some allies recur through a number of instalments, such as the Western-friendly KGB chief, General Gogol, Sir Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defence and Ren√© Mathis. Felix Leiter One of Bond's closest allies in both the novels and films is CIA operative Felix Leiter. Fleming wrote twelve novels, of which Leiter appears in six; in the second book, Live and Let Die, Leiter was attacked by a shark and lost his right arm and half his left leg and his subsequent appearances were with prosthetics. For the film series the shark attack occurred in Licence to Kill, the fifteenth instalment in the series. Following Licence to Kill, Leiter did not appear until the reboot of the franchise with Casino Royale. In total Leiter appears in nine Eon Bond films: four out of the six Connery films, one film with Moore, both Dalton instalments and none with Brosnan (where Bond's CIA contact is Jack Wade), but returned for Craig's; he is also not in George Lazenby's sole Bond film. In the Eon series, there were no Leiter film appearances between 1973 and 1987 and no Leiter appearances between 1989 and 2006. Although other recurring characters in the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors have played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey in one of the non- Eon films, Never Say Never Again. =Chase scenes= alt=Daniel Craig running a staircase upwards, Roger Moore on the staircase of Eiffel Tower, Sean Connery driving a car, and Timothy Dalton alongside Maryam d'Abo sliding down a snowy hill in a cello case Keeping with the greater Hollywood tradition, every Bond film features chase scenes, usually more than one per film. Bond and his allies evade their pursuers in a wide variety of vehicles, including custom air- and watercraft, to trucks and even tanks and moon-buggies. Although most chase sequences feature Bond getting chased by the villains, such as the Aston-Martin DB5 in Goldfinger and the ski sequence in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, some feature Bond chasing the villains, such as the tank pursuit in GoldenEye and all sequences in Casino Royale. As the Eon series has progressed, the chases have repeated themselves with some variations and have all increased in extravagance. Among the more unusual chase sequences include the gondola sequence from Moonraker, which leaves the canals of Venice to continue on land, and the cello case chase in The Living Daylights, as well as a double-decker bus in Live and Let Die. International locations Countries James Bond has visited in the filmsalt=World map, with countries visited by the James Bond film crew coloured both dark and light blue, countries in which the films are set but were not filmed actually there in purple, and other countries in grey Bond's adventures have taken him to over sixty countries, as well as outer space, in locations mostly described as attractive and exotic. These locations are primarily real places, though on occasion‚Äîsuch as San Monique (Live and Let Die) and Isthmus (Licence to Kill)‚Äîthe destinations have been fictional. The locations used for filming have often altered because of the effects of Bond's presence: Scaramanga's hideout on Ko Tapu () in The Man with the Golden Gun is often now referred to as James Bond Island both by locals and in tourist guidebooks. Similarly, the revolving restaurant, located atop the Schilthorn near the village of M√ºrren used in On Her Majesty's Secret Service has retained the name Piz Gloria since filming took place there. Klaus Dodds has noted that there is a geopolitical aspect to the locations used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. Characters =Larger-than-life villains= For the series of Bond novels, Fleming realised that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films. Whilst Bond scholar Glenn Yeffeth argues that there are only three Bond villains of note‚ÄîDr. No, Auric Goldfinger and Ernst Stavro Blofeld, fellow scholar Kerstin J√ºtting has identified a path of development of villains, all of whom adapt to a contemporary zeitgeist: * Ernst Stavro Blofeld (1963‚Äì2015)‚ÄîModel megalomaniac facing 007 seven times *Francisco Scaramanga (1974)‚Äîthe first \\"freelance\\" villain *Aristotle Kristatos (1981)‚Äîthe first false ally *Franz Sanchez (1989)‚Äîthe first villain with the already fulfilled operation *Alec Trevelyan (1995)‚Äîthe first MI6 villain *Elliot Carver (1997)‚Äîthe modern megalomaniac *Elektra King (1999)‚Äîthe first villainess *Raoul Silva (2012)‚Äîthe first attack on M Many of Bond's adversaries are characterised by an unusual physical deformity; for example, Le Chiffre suffered haemolacria, causing his tear ducts to weep blood. Not all of the villains have unusual physical traits; Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene was depicted without such characteristics, instead being inspired by Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy. Many of the henchmen employed by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her thighs during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2\\") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses and his ability to feel pain. Many of Bond's adversaries meet their deaths at the hands of Bond who often uses his environment or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod. =Bond girls= At some point on the mission, Bond meets the principal Bond girl, a character portraying Bond's love interest or one of his main sex objects. There is always one Bond girl central to the plot, and often one or two others who cross his path, helpful or not. They may be victims rescued by Bond, or else ally agents, villainesses, or henchwomen. Many partner with Bond on the assignment, while others such as Honey Ryder are solely passive participants in the mission. More generally, the degree to which Bond girls are pivotal to propelling the plot forward varies from one film to the next. Five of the Bond girls are \\"bad\\" girls (or at least working for the villain) who turn \\"good\\" (or switch sides) usually due to Bond's influence. Bond has fallen in love with only Tracy di Vicenzo in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, but both of them die at or near the end of the respective films. Roald Dahl, a screenwriter of You Only Live Twice, said he was given a formula to work to for the film: \\"you put in three girls ... Girl number one is pro-Bond. She stays around roughly through the first reel of the picture. Then she is bumped off by the enemy, preferably in Bond's arms.\\" The next girl is anti-Bond and normally captures him, but Bond will save himself by using his charm and sexual potency: she is normally killed midway through the film. Girl number three will survive and end the film in Bond's embrace. Academic Kimberly A. Neuendorf notes that James Bond promotes stereotypical, sex-typed male attitudes, especially when interacting with women and in doing so demonstrates Western society's patriarchal, individualistic culture. Academic Tricia Jenkins, meanwhile, sees that Bond as \\"hyperheterosexual\\", as he is \\"more masculine, more sexually desirable, more heterosexual than the others around him\\". Bond girls became a major theme in many Bond film posters, beginning with Dr. No; the suggestiveness of the images used had to be toned down in some countries. Bond girls often have highly suggestive names, including Goldfinger Pussy Galore, which the American censor refused to allow on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently referred to as \\"Miss Galore\\" or \\"Goldfinger's personal pilot\\"; however Honor Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning her character's name. Other double entendre names included Holly Goodhead from Moonraker, Mary Goodnight and Chew Mee from The Man with the Golden Gun, Honey Ryder from Dr. No, Plenty O'Toole from Diamonds Are Forever, Xenia Onatopp from GoldenEye, and Christmas Jones from The World Is Not Enough. Humour One of the elements used throughout the Bond series is humour, particularly 'one-liners', delivered by Bond, either when killing an enemy, or at the end of the film when with a woman. The humour was present in the first film in the series, Dr. No, with Bond leaving a corpse in a car outside Government House and asking the Duty Sergeant to make sure he didn't get away, whilst in Goldfinger, Bond electrocutes a man in a bath, before commenting, \\"Shocking, positively shocking\\". During Sean Connery's Bond films, the humour was delivered by Connery to soften a violent situation, such as the electrification, or his shooting a villain with a spear gun and saying \\"I think he got the point\\". The humour changed towards innuendo and self-mockery during the Roger Moore films, with his jokes delivered with what media historian James Chapman considered to be a \\"wink at the audience\\", with the suggestion that the violence was all a joke. This was shown in Live and Let Die when he threw the villain, Tee Hee, out of a train, removing his prosthetic arm in the process, Moore commented that he was \\"Just being disarming, darling\\". When Timothy Dalton took the role, the humour was downplayed, bringing the character more in line with that of the novels. The humour returned for the Brosnan films, with Bond admitting between kisses that he \\"always enjoyed studying a new tongue\\". Similarly, Moneypenny called Bond a \\"cunning linguist\\" after she interrupted his lesson with his Danish-language teacher. Brosnan was not happy with some of the humour in the films, particularly the \\"stupid one-liners ‚Äî which I loathed ‚Äî and I always felt phony doing them\\". The films often include a one-liner, often of a sexual nature, at the d√©nouement. At the close of The Spy Who Loved Me, Roger Moore's final line when caught with a woman, was that he was \\"Keeping the British end up, Sir!\\", something that Chapman considered to have \\"plumbed new depths of banality\\". Similarly, Moonraker closes with a distracted Q answering M's question of \\"What's he doing?\\" with \\"I think he's attempting re-entry, sir\\"; a line described by Barnes and Hearn as \\"sheer magnificence\\". The films also contain elements of visual humour: when Jaws is dropped into a shark pool in The Spy Who Loved Me, it is Jaws who bites the shark. The following film, Moonraker, sees Bond in a comic chase scene with a gondola that becomes a hovercraft, a continuation that Bond author Raymond Benson considered \\"so dumb that one wonders at what age group the film was really aimed.\\" The music and sound effects are also used for comic effect in the films: the laboratory of Hugo Drax is opened by touchtones that play the tune of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whilst when Bond and Anya are seen walking across the desert in The Spy Who Loved Me, the theme from Lawrence of Arabia is heard. D√©nouement =Protracted attempt to kill Bond= In most of the films, the main villain often captures Bond and, rather than kill him quickly, attempts a slow and protracted death, from which Bond always escapes. This will often also come with a scene of the villain explaining his master plan to Bond. Goldfinger chained Bond to a nuclear bomb in the vault, while Alec Trevelyan tied an unconscious Bond to a helicopter that was programmed to fire its own missiles at itself. Francisco Scaramanga gave Bond lunch and then proposed a duel in his \\"fun room\\", while Hugo Drax trapped Bond beneath the exhaust of a rocket to burn to death. This convention within the Bond canon has been lampooned in spoof films, including the Austin Powers series. =Climax= The climax of most Bond films is the final confrontation with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair. The villain's retreat can be a private island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let Die), a ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)‚Äîamong other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene. =Ending= In the first twenty two films of the Eon Bond series, only On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Casino Royale, have ended with the central Bond girl deceased. In all other films, except Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, Bond is kissing her, making love, or implying that he will do so. Sometimes an embarrassed M catches Bond during his embraces. Most endings feature a double entendre and, in many of the films, the Bond girl purrs, \\"Oh, James.\\" Until A View to a Kill, the title of the next film to be produced was also usually named, in the format \\"James Bond will return...\\" or \\"James Bond will be back\\", although these were sometimes incorrect: The Spy Who Loved Me promised James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only, but after the success of Star Wars, the producers decided to make Moonraker instead and For Your Eyes Only followed in 1981. Quotations An \\"infamous line\\" in cinema. alt=Video clip from the film, set in a casino. A woman at the table, wearing a red dress, asks \\"Mister...\\" and a man in a suit answers \\"Bond, James Bond\\" as he lights his cigarette. The first Bond film, Dr. No, included the introduction of the character of James Bond. Bond was introduced in an exchange near the beginning of the film in a \\"now-famous nightclub sequence featuring Sylvia Trench\\", to whom he makes his \\"immortal introduction\\". It was Sean Connery's second line in the film. Following the release of Dr. No, the quote \\"Bond ... James Bond\\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \\"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\\". In 2001 it was voted as the \\"best- loved one-liner in cinema\\" by British cinema goers. On 21 June 2005, the line was honoured as the 22nd historically greatest cinema quotation by the American Film Institute, in its 100 Years Series. Not all the films contain the introduction, Quantum of Solace, for example and in others it is often mocked by others‚Äîin Thunderball, the villainous character Fiona Volpe mocks him by saying it to him while with Mr. Big in Live and Let Die interrupts Bond's introduction with: \\"Names is for tombstones, baby... waste him!\\" Likewise, in Goldfinger, Tilly Masterson cuts him off as he's offering his name by asking him to carry her luggage. Bond usually evinces a preference for vodka martinis and his instruction on how it must be prepared quickly became another catchphrase. The instruction was honoured by the AFI as the 90th most- memorable cinema quotation. In order to distance his version of Bond from Sean Connery's, Roger Moore did not order a martini. The martini was present in the first Ian Fleming novel, Casino Royale, where Bond eventually named it \\"The Vesper\\", after Vesper Lynd. The same recipe was then used for the 2006 film of the novel, with the martini ordered by Daniel Craig's Bond.

It took place mainly in the eastern region of the island where most Afro-Cubans were employed. After a widespread massacre of Afro-Cubans by the Cuban Army and the intervention by the U.S. military the rebellion was brought an end in a matter of weeks. The leaders of Afro-Cuban rebels, Evaristo Estenoz and Pedro Ivonnet, were killed during the rebellion and their political movement, the Independent Party of Color, was dissolved. Background =Social conditions= Conditions in Cuba were poor for the black inhabitants, most of whom were employed in the sugarcane industry. Evaristo Estenoz led a movement to better these conditions which had begun in 1895 during the war for independence from Spain. Veterans of that war, primarily officers, organized the Independent Party of Color in 1908. Under the leadership of Estenoz, the party quickly gained the support of a large number of Afro-Cubans in opposition to Cuban President Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez. G√≥mez ordered the party disbanded under the Mor√∫a law, which outlawed political parties based on race. By 1912 the Independent Party of Color had regrouped to stage another rebellion. =US Marines in Cuba= In early 1912, the United States government sent a detachment of 688 US Marines, officers and enlisted men, to Guantanamo Naval Base, while, Estenoz and his followers were preparing a rebellion. Though they were lightly armed, the rebels numbered several hundred men, mainly peasants. History =Beginning= On 20 May, Estenoz and his men confronted the Cuban Army. Fighting took place mainly in Oriente Province, where most African Cubans lived, while there were also a few minor outbreaks of violence in the west, particularly in Las Villas Province. Initially the rebels were successful in engaging the Cuban forces, which included soldiers and militia. On 23 May, President G√≥mez requested aid from U.S. President William H. Taft, who sent additional marines. The first reinforcements arrived on 28 May, landing at Deer Point, Guantanamo Bay, to link up with Major Thorpe's battalion. Colonel Lincoln Karmany was in command of this new force, designated the 1st Provisional Regiment of Marines. It numbered 32 officers and 777 enlisted men. =Cuban official response= The Cuban government and press responded by demonizing the rebels with heavy racism. The Cuban President called on the Cuban people to fight for \\"civilization\\" against \\"ferocious savagery\\". The President also invoked the image of a \\"raped teacher\\" which turned out to be from a fake news story from a conservative newspaper. The conservative newspaper \\"El Dia\\" argued that Cuba should copy Jim Crow Laws in the United States where\\"blacks are mistreated and society is segregated\\" concluding that \\"dominated races do submit\\". Afro-Cuban politicians became worried and angered over the rise the racism during the rebellion. The racial demagoguery angered Juan Gualberto Gomez, former Cuban independence leader, such that he published a manifesto condemning it. =Arrival of United States forces= The 2nd Provisional Regiment of Marines with 1,292 officers and men under Colonel James E. Mahoney was also en route. Most arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 7 June, while one battalion was landed at Havana on 10 June. USS Mississippi landed her detachment at El Cuero on 19 June. Of the 1,292 men who landed at Guantanamo, only one battalion was deployed. Colonel Karmany took command of all the unassigned troops. Together, the American forces in Cuba totaled 2,789 officers and men and were organized into the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. About half of them were sent to occupy towns and cities in eastern Cuba. The rest remained at the naval base. In June Estenoz rapidly began losing control of his territory to the Cuban military, which was dispersing large bands of the rebels and bystanders. Rebel forces had once numbered at least 3,000 men, but by June there were an estimated 1,800 left alive, although some sources cite 6000 exterminated. =Suppression= The Marines were assigned to protect the American-owned sugarcane plantations and their associated properties, as well as copper mines, railroads and trains. The Afro-Cubans attacked the Marines only once, at El Cuero, but were repulsed without casualties on either side. President G√≥mez offered amnesty to any of the rebels who surrendered by 22 June, but Estenoz continued to fight with a few hundred men, though most of the rebels surrendered. By the end of June the majority had returned to their homes. Estenoz was killed by government forces who shot him in the back of the head at Miraca on 27 June. Estenoz's death splintered the rebel army into small factions which were soon defeated. The most important faction was that of Pedro Ivonnet, who led his forces into the mountains to wage a guerrilla war, but he was driven out by the middle of July. Ivonnet surrendered on July 18, 1912, but was killed, reportedly while \\"trying to escape\\". Aftermath Following Ivonnet's surrender, G√≥mez announced that the American Marines were no longer needed and they began to withdraw, first to the naval base at Guantanamo and then to stations in the United States. The last Marines to leave Cuba embarked on the USS Prairie on 2 August. The Afro-Cubans suffered between 3,000 and 6,000 casualties, both combatants and non-combatants, and the results of the rebellion were disastrous. The Independent Party of Color was dissolved and conditions in Cuba remained unchanged.

Established during the 1885 gold rush, Granite Creek townsite is now a ghost town in the Similkameen region of British Columbia, Canada. Early years A cowboy and sometimes prospector named Johnny Chance discovered gold in Granite Creek in 1885. The discovery of gold led to the creation of a mining settlement, sometimes informally called \\"Granite City\\", in 1885. The federal Post Office named \\"Granite Creek\\" was opened on May 1, 1886. It remained open with only one temporary closure, until March 31, 1918. Granite Creek lay deep in the remote Tulameen country of southern British Columbia. By 1886 Granite Creek contained 300 European prospectors and 100 Chinese. On April 21, 1886 the newspaper called the Victoria Colonist reported Granite City(sic) had \\"9 general stores,14 hotels and restaurants,2 jewelers,3 bakers,3 blacksmiths,2 livery stables,a shoemaker, butcher, chemist, attorney, doctor and 8 pack trains owned in the city. 200 buildings occupy the two main streets - Government and Granite.\\"  year = 1885,1886,1887. Annual report of the Minister of Mines. Granite Creek was mistakenly regarded as one of the largest cities in British Columbia. The town never contained a school, church nor a local governing body. The jail did not have bars on the windows. The windows were one foot square. Gold production dropped sharply by 1889 causing many people to leave, and there was a major fire on April 4, 1907. Granite nevertheless survived for some years after that. In 1910 Columbia Coal and Coke Company opened their offices there, but with the building of Coalmont in 1912 there was less reason for the town to exist. Still, the Granite Creek Post Office didn't close until March 31, 1918. Over the next few decades Granite Creek became slowly abandoned and eventually overgrown but there were still people living there in 1925.http://www.granitecreekbc.ca/history.html The 1930s By 1915 the gold rush was over and Granite Creek lay deserted. The depression of the 1930s brought drifters to Granite Creek area hoping to eke out a living on the placer gold creeks of the past. By the time the depression came to an end only a handful of miners lived at what was the former gold rush boom town called Granite Creek. By the 1960s the last of these miners in Granite Creek had passed on and the townsite became a ghost town of British Columbia. Only a very few partial log buildings stand on the original site. Lost platinum cache British Columbia Historian Bill Barlee reports the story of a Scandinavian by the name of Johanssen. Johanssen recovered a reported 300 ounces of platinum from Granite Creek, British Columbia. Johanssen is reported to have buried his cache of platinum in a bucket south of his cabin and visible from the cabin door. Granite City(sic) was destroyed by a fire in 1907. Johanssen's cabin was levelled by the fire. With the cabin lost so was the location as to where the cache was. The platinum cache is reported to still be there, close to $50,000 in platinum buried somewhere in Granite City(sic). This legend should be lightly regarded as, other than N.L. Barlee's story, there is no evidence supporting this legend or of such a cache. In pop culture Granite Creek was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, Season 1, Episode 11.

Early life Hicky was born in Ireland around the year 1740. While young, he moved to London to apprentice with William Faden, a Scottish printer. However, Hicky never took his freedom from the printers' guild, and instead secured a clerkship with an English lawyer, Sarjeant Davy. At some point Hicky quit his career in law, and, after a brief attempt practising as a surgeon in London, he boarded an East Indiaman as a surgeon's mate bound for Calcutta in 1772. Upon landing in Calcutta, Hicky practised as both a surgeon and a merchant, shipping and trading goods along India's coast. But, by 1776, his shipping business collapsed as his vessel returned to port with its cargo badly damaged. Unable to reassure his creditors, Hicky entered debtors' prison in October 1776. James Augustus Hicky's Bill to the East India Company for a printing job While in jail, Hicky acquired a printing press and types and by 1777 began a printing business from jail. In 1778, Hicky hired Lawyer William Hickey (who, confusingly, was not related to Hicky) to get rid of his debts and free him from jail. Hicky's Bengal Gazette Front page of Hicky's Bengal Gazette, 10 March 1781, from the University of Heidelberg's archives. Hicky began publication of Hicky's Bengal Gazette on 29 January 1780. Hicky first maintained a neutral editing policy but after he learned that other men were about to bring a rival newspaper, The India Gazette, to market, he accused an East India Company employee, Simeon Droz of supporting the India Gazette's editors because he had refused to pay a bribe to Droz and Marian Hastings, Warren Hastings' wife. In retaliation for Hicky's accusation, Hastings' Supreme Council forbid Hicky from mailing his newspaper through the post office. Hicky claimed Hastings' order violated his right to free expression, and accused Hastings of corruption, tyranny, and even erectile dysfunction.Jane Borges, The journalist who accused Warren Hastings of erectile dysfunction, Mid-Day India, 6 May 2018. Hicky also accused other British leaders in Calcutta of corruption, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, Elijah Impey, and the leader of the Protestant Mission, Johann Zacharias Kiernander. Hicky's editorial independence was short lived as Hastings and Kiernander sued him for libel. After four dramatic trials in June 1781, the Supreme Court found Hicky guilty and sentenced him to jail. Hicky continued to print his newspaper from jail, and continued to accuse Hastings and other of corruption. He was finally shuttered when Hastings instituted fresh lawsuits against him. Hicky's Bengal Gazette ceased publication on 30 March 1782 when its types were seized by an order of the Supreme Court. Later life Hicky was freed from jail about Christmas 1784, when Warren Hastings, about to embark to England to face impeachment, forgave his debts. Little is known about Hicky's later life, except that his health was ruined after three years in jail, and that he lived in poverty. Hicky died on a boat to China in October 1802. Legacy Although his newspaper was disliked by the then Governor-General of India, Warren Hastings, Hicky paved the way and influenced multiple Indians to start newspapers. Hicky's printing office was the training ground for many later printers who went on to found their own newspapers, leading to a vibrant newspaper scene in Bengal. Abhijit Ganguly, Raging Against The Raj: The First Newspaper in Asia, Business Economics Magazine, 30 June 2014. No images of Hicky survive to this day. However, his signature and handwriting can be found on old documents.

Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during runtime. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users. In this way, feature flags can be used to implement targeted rollouts of features to specific subsets of users, a practice known as feature gating. Continuous release and continuous deployment provide developers with rapid feedback about their coding. This requires the integration of their code changes as early as possible. Feature branches introduce a bypass to this process. Feature toggles are an important technique used for the implementation of continuous delivery. The technique allows developers to release a version of a product that has unfinished features. These unfinished features are hidden (toggled) so they do not appear in the user interface. This allows many small incremental versions of software to be delivered without the cost of constant branching and merging. Feature toggles may allow shorter software integration cycles. A team working on a project can use feature toggle to speed up the process of development, that can include the incomplete code as well.  Implementation  Feature toggles are essentially variables that are used inside conditional statements. Therefore, the blocks inside these conditional statements can be toggled 'on or off' depending on the value of the feature toggles. A block of code which has been toggled 'off' is similar to it being commented out. This allows developers to control the flow of their software and bypass features that are not ready for deployment. The main usage of feature toggles is to avoid conflict that can arise when merging changes in software at the last moment before release, although this can lead to toggle debt. Toggle debt arises due to the dead code present in software after a feature has been toggled on permanently and produces overhead. This portion of the code has to be removed carefully as to not disturb other parts of the code. There are two main types of feature toggle. One is a release toggle, which the developer determines to either keep or remove before a product release depending on its working. The other is a business toggle, which is kept because it satisfies a different usage compared to that of the older code. Feature toggles can be used in the following scenarios: * Adding a new feature to an application. * Enhancing an existing feature in an application. * Hiding or disabling a feature. * Extending an interface. Feature toggles can be stored as: * Row entries in a database. * A property in a configuration file. * An entry in an external feature flag service. = Feature groups = Feature groups consist of feature toggles that work together. This allows the developer to easily manage a set of related toggles.  Canary release  Another benefit of feature flags is canary launches. A canary release (or canary launch or canary deployment) allows developers to have features incrementally tested by a small set of users. If a feature's performance is not satisfactory, then it can be rolled back without any adverse effects. Martin Fowler states that a feature toggle \\"should be your last choice when you're dealing with putting features into production\\". Instead, it is best to break the feature into smaller parts that each can be implemented and safely introduced into the released product without causing other problems. Feature-toggling is used by many large websites including Flickr, Disqus, Etsy, reddit, Gmail and Netflix, as well as software such as Google Chrome Canary.

History The idea for an International Congress on Fracture dates to 1961 and a meeting at MIT when an ‚ÄúInterim International Conference Committee‚Äù was established under the Chairmanship of Takeo Yokobori. ICF1 was then organised in Sendai, Japan in November 1965 and it was at ICF2 in Brighton, England that ICF was formally founded in April 1969 with statutes and by-laws, a Council and Executive. Thereafter ICF organised a major conference every four years. ICF also organised ‚Äúinterquadrennial‚Äù conferences, the first of which was in Beijing, China in November 1983. ICF established national organisations in their member nations, one of the first being the ‚ÄúAustralasian Fracture Group‚Äù founded in 1971. ICF became more than a conference organiser and rather a society for the broad field of structural integrity, fracture, fatigue, creep, corrosion and reliability ‚Äì from biological to geophysical materials: metals, alloys, ceramics, composites, electronic and natural materials. The scope evolved through ICF1-1CF12 from nano to macro scales, from basic science, engineering and mathematics to practical technology and systems modelling for safe design. At an ICF Interquadrennial Conference in Anaheim, USA May 2011 ICF was renamed ‚ÄúICF: The World Academy of Structural Integrity‚Äù. Structure ICF-WASI is governed by a Council which comprises members from each member nation, with one nation one vote. The Council meets once every four years at each ICF-WASI Quadrennial. Council delegates the management of ICF-WASI to a President and an Executive Committee. Since ICF6 the Treasurer has acted as the de facto CEO working closely with the President and Secretary-General. Council elects Fellows every four years who are now termed ‚ÄúAcademicians‚Äù (50). ICF-WASI in its widest sense consists also of the ‚ÄúAssociates‚Äù who comprise the whole community of the up to 10,000 delegates who have attended Quadrennial and Interquadrennial conferences.

Exhibition  The Saarbr√ºcker Abenteuermuseum, founded by the globetrotter, artist, author, and filmmaker Heinz Rox-Schulz, was an institution of the capital of Saarland. In the course of his trips to Africa, Asia, South America, and New Guinea, he brought curiosities and cultural objects like shrunk heads from Jivaro-Indians, hand axes, swords, rhino heads, sculptures, and Tibetan skull cups. The ethnological treasures include such as a corn mummy and a life-size figure in full gear of a warrior of the Tuareq from the Sahara. On his travels, Heinz Rox-Schulz battled his way as an artist and gymnast. Later, he became a cameraman at Saarl√§ndischen Rundfunk. His adventures and experiences can be found in his books \\"Die Abenteuer des Mr. Rox: Ohne Geld in die Welt\\" or \\"Himmel und H√∂lle Indien\\". He died a few days after his eighty-third birthday in the march of 2004. Until the end he guided school classes through his museum to promote respect for other cultures.  Closure and reopening  In October 2004 the museum within the \\"Alten Rathaus am Schlossplatz\\" has been closed because the city canceled the grants for the personnel costs. It's stocks has been stored in boxes in rooms of the city of Saarbr√ºcken since September 2005. On 10 February 2009, the city council or Saarbr√ºcken refused the proposal to host the museum in two rooms in the former Saarbr√ºcker Deutschherrnschule. The city council decided to locate an ethnological collection, which should take the remaining stocks of the \\"Abenteuermuseum\\". Since November 2013, pieces of the collection can be found in the Krimicafe \\"Baker Street\\", which is located at the Mainzer Stra√üe in Saarbr√ºcken. In addition to the permanent exhibition the booster club \\"Freunde des Abenteuermuseums\\" wants to keep up the memories of Rox-Schulz by arranging regular special exhibitions.

Initially horse-drawn, she was later, from around 1939, towed by a tractor. Towed vessels on the Saar were designated Penichen. Until 1992 there were towpaths along the waterways (Treidelpfad or Leinpfad in German). After these were eliminated the Anna Leonie was unable to be used any longer, because she remained without her own drive motor. In any case, she had lain tied up since the 1960s alongside the Congresshalle in Saarbr√ºcken. The Anna Leonie was ordered from the shipyard of the Gebr√ºder Sch√§fer in V√∂lklingen on order from the boatman Johann Kind. He lived on board with his family, and named the ship after his two youngest daughters. His son continued to live on the ship until his death in 1987. By 2006 the Anna Leonie was the last of its kind and it was determined that it should continue to be maintained.

At the age of 15 years he went to sea like most Faroese did and sailed with fishing boats for four years and took a compulsory exam in Torshavn in 1923. In 1924, he went to Denmark where he attended Karise Folk High School and in 1929 he received a teaching degree from Jonstrup's Seminar. He then returned to his birthplace, Toftir, where he was an assistant teacher from 1929 to 1931, secondary teacher from 1931 to 1933, and school director from 1934 to 1953. H√∏jgaard had been a choir in Toftir and Torshavn and has composed numerous Faroese songs and hymns. H√∏jgaard's great significance for Faroese music life is partly due to the skill and stimulating enthusiasm with which he as a teacher and choreographer has continued and refined the korsang tradition that existed before the time in the Faroe Islands, and his lush business as a song composer. H√∏jgaard's songs are distinguished by their fresh and uromantical singability as well as their originality. They have their own style that often brings memories of the peculiar tones that characterize the old Faroese quadrals and hymns. He was an honorary member of Harbors Song Event in 1978.

It was written and produced by Bj√∂rk herself, while programming and beats were made in collaboration with Matthew Herbert and the English dubstep band 16bit. \\"Mutual Core\\" is an uptempo experimental song. Its music includes Pipe organ, electronica-tinged sounds and features the Choir Graduale Nobili, the choir featured on Biophilia. The song's lyrics are a metaphor for human relationships, compared to the structure of the Earth and Plate tectonics. The song was well received by contemporary music critics, who praised its production and beats, moreover appreciating Bj√∂rk's voice on the track. As with all the songs on Biophilia, an app was made for the song, which features a video game in which the player have to move geological layers as an accordion to play chords. Though the song wasn't released as a single, a music video was produced, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang. The video was critically applauded and received further attention when it got projected for one month in Times Square in 2013, and then across the 7 continents. Bj√∂rk promoted the song by performing it throughout her Biophilia Tour. Three remixes by Matthew Herbert, 16bit and These New Puritans were released as part of Biophilia Remix Series. The Matthew Herbert's and the These New Puritans remixes were later included on bastards (2012). In July 2012, the online music store Beatport announced a fan contest in which \\"Mutual Core\\" had to be remixed, to be released afterwards on a remix package. Background Matthew Herbert provided beat and programming for the song which he also remixed. At the end of 2010, Bj√∂rk confirmed she was working on a new album. In an interview published on Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞, the singer stated that the project was midway through the completion and that she hoped to go on tour before the end of 2011. The project was officialised in March 2011, with the announcement of Bj√∂rk performance at Manchester International Festival. The project, called Biophilia, comprises a series of live performances, a new website, a documentary and a series of apps, besides the release as a music album which is partly composed on an iPad. The Biophilia Tour was said to be touring eight cities for three years and to be including a series of workshops for children in collaboration with local schools. The first details about \\"Mutual Core\\" came regarding its app, which was described to allow users to \\"arrange geological layers to form chords\\". \\"Mutual Core\\" was written and produced by Bj√∂rk, while the beat of the song was made in collaboration with Matthew Herbert and 16bit. The song was engineered by Damian Taylor and Sveinn Kjartansson, with mixing provided by Taylor and Bj√∂rk. \\"Mutual Core\\"'s lyrics were inspired by human relationships and by Bj√∂rk's family decisions, who had to decide where her daughter, √çsad√≥ra, would go to school between New York City and Reykjav√≠k. Bj√∂rk felt that the song is \\"the most personal [on the album] for me\\". David Fricke of Rolling Stone noted that \\"Bj√∂rk likens the human emotions ‚Äì love, physical obsession, changing moods, violent hurt ‚Äì in songs such as \\"Mutual Core\\", \\"Moon\\" and \\"Virus\\" to natural phenomena: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, lunar phases and contagious disease\\". Three official remixes of the song have been released. The first one was released on Biophilia Remix Series VI on 25 June 2012, and it is a remix by long time- collaborator Matthew Herbert. Bj√∂rk stated about Herbert's remixes: \\"He has taken it full on and made it into his version but still true to the heart of the song and, more than once, improved it\\". RJ Cubarrubia of Rolling Stone commented that the remix \\"builds slowly with background bleeps and opaque textures before erupting into a cacophonous rumble\\". The second one is a remix by 16bit, which was released as part of Biophilia Remix Series VII on July 9, 2012. This version had already been released as part of a promo for Icelandair flights, playing the song in flights to Iceland during Bj√∂rk's concert residency in Reykjavik in Summer 2011. Other two remixes of \\"Crystalline\\" and \\"Sacrifice\\" were played. The last remix by These New Puritans has been on November 12, 2012 on Biophilia Remix Series VIII. The remix includes samples from the Traditional composition \\"Funeral Song (Solomon Islands 1978)\\", as extracted from the album Spirit of Melanesia by David Fanshawe. On October 8, 2012, the track list for bastards was announced, and the Matthew Herbert's and the These New Puritans remixes were included. On late July 2012, Beatport announced a contest in which the participants had to remix \\"Mutual Core\\". The winner would have their remix released on One Little Indian Records in a remix package to be sold on the website. The winner was announced on 18 September 2012, as \\"Breakwave\\". This remix, later renamed \\"Waxx Crooks Remix\\", was released on December 10, 2012. Composition \\"Mutual Core\\" is an uptempo experimental song, which displays elements from electro, techno, glitch, breakcore and ambient, and includes also a choral part during the chorus. The rhythm of the song can be roughly divided into two distinct parts: the verses, which feature moderately sparse electronic beats and a time signature of 5/4, and the choruses, which display more upbeat sounds and a 2/4 time signature. According to Mark Diver of BBC Music during the shift from the verse and the chorus the song \\"slips from blissful ambience into bombastic electronic percussion, leaving the senses reeling, only to fade back into a comforting lilt\\". The instrumentation of the verses includes a pipe organ. Sound designer David Paterson described the way Bj√∂rk wanted the music on \\"Mutual Core\\": \\"Bjork described the sounds she wanted in a way that left it very open to interpretation. With the track \\"Mutual Core\\", for example, she described how it was about magnetic attraction ‚Äì which doesn't really have a sound that springs to mind\\". Luke Turner of NME noted that \\"[Bj√∂rk's] voice cracks against the increasing, insistent power of the electronic rhythms, as if recognising our human insignificance in the face of geology\\", citing the verse \\"As fast as your fingernail grows / The Atlantic ridge drifts\\" as an example, and, on a similar note, Odile De Plas of T√©l√©rama found the singer's voice \\"strong, acrobat, guttural and [...] crystalline\\". The musical shift occurs when the singer pronounces the words \\"Core\\", during which, as described by Nikki Debben in her essay included in the Manual Edition of Biophilia, the \\"modality switches from minor to major\\". The lecturer noted that \\"the close, dark sound of the verse is partly due to the minor mode which has a flattened third degree, compared to the brighter sound of the chorus in the major mode which has the \\"normal\\" third degree of the chord\\". This part of the song uses a Plagal cadence, which involves a movement \\"from a chord built on the fourth degree of the scale to one built on the first degree of the scale\\". The chorus of the song features a vocal crescendo performed by the choir, which juxtaposes with breakcore-influenced beats, which display elements from dub. Chris Chafin of Capital compared the sound of the chorus to the work of The Chemical Brothers and stated that tracks like \\"Crystalline\\" and \\"Mutual Core\\" recall previous works from Bj√∂rk's discography, especially Post (1995) and Homogenic (1997). Critical reception The song was generally well received by music critics, who cited it as a highlight of the album. According to Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork, the song \\"may be the album‚Äôs best track overall\\", citing \\"its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk\\", while giving the album an average review; on a similar note, Arnold Pan of PopMatters defined the song as \\"the album‚Äôs most viscerally powerful number\\" citing that \\"that‚Äôs music that sounds just as at home in the sacred place of a vast cathedral as it is in the virtual vacuum of cyberspace\\". Gareth James of Clash praised the album and stated that \\"when the machine-gun beats do break through on \\"Mutual Core\\", they're augmented by a hymnal organ riff and a soaring, unprocessed and unleashed vocal which will leave you breathless\\". \\"Mutual Core\\" was described as \\"best\\" and \\"climactic\\" by Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, which elected Biophilia as the CD of the Week, and \\"literally volcanic\\" by Heather Phares of Allmusic. Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal stated that the track is \\"earthbound\\". According to the Daily Mirror review, the track \\"adds angry rebuke and glitchy distorted power chordings to the shimmering, ringing percussion and natural awe that feature on the astonishing tracks \\"Virus\\" and aptly named \\"Crystalline\\"\\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the composition of the album and stated \\"There‚Äôs something audacious and impressive about the way \\"Hollow\\" attempts to strike a weird balance between menace and calm, the vocals as lulling as the staccato backing is unsettling. Or \\"Mutual Core\\"‚Äôs repeated shifts from a wheezing keyboard ‚Äì it was doubtless built in a laboratory by the provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor Brian Cox, but it sounds like a 13th-century portative organ ‚Äì to electronic bombardment\\". M√∂hammed Choudhery of Consequence of Sound analysed the use of Bj√∂rk's voice in the album, stating: > Her unique utility of the English language gives her words a quirky, > idiosyncratic edge, allowing lines like ‚Äúif you forget my name, you‚Äôll go > astray/ like a killer whale‚Äù to ring somehow striking. Said masterstrokes > and quirks are well intact here, as is evident in the asteroid-bass volley > of \\"Mutual Core\\" and lead single \\"Crystalline\\"‚Äòs apocalyptical breakbeat > coda. Biophilia‚Äòs finest moments are its most subtly captivating, many of > which are (admittedly) almost forgettable on first listen. The > aforementioned \\"Mutual Core\\" and \\"Crystalline\\" can be assured a spot on any > and all future Best of Bj√∂rk compilations, compelling in how they blend > archaic instrumentation with blistering electronica. Despite this, some critics dubbed the song as \\"tedious\\" and \\"interesting but not surprising\\". Andy Gill of The Independent gave a negative review of the album, praising only the choral elements, stating that: \\"they‚Äôre a constant delight as she reflects upon her desire for the \\"dangerous gifts\\" of elemental nature, the lightning-flash of creative inspiration (\\"Thunderbolt\\"); muses about being a bead threaded upon a DNA chain (\\"Hollow\\"); explores the ethically neutral, natural attraction of parasite to host (\\"Virus\\"); admires the creative force of volcanic energy (\\"Mutual Core\\")\\". App A still from the \\"Mutual Core\\" app As with all the songs on Biophilia, \\"Mutual Core\\" was released as an app for iPhone or iPad. \\"Mutual Core\\" app features a video game in which the player arranges geological layers in the same way as an accordion to play chords. During the verses, the player tries to unite the hemispheres, because the energy keeps them apart while during the chorus the app shifts to a cutaway of a planet, and the player can touch the layers of the planet's interior to open it up and touch the core. The player may also change the resistance of the chords to increase the difficulty. The app was released on October 10, 2011, along with the rest of the apps from Biophilia. On January 17, 2012, Bj√∂rk uploaded a video tutorial explaining the app on her official YouTube channel, commented also by Biophilia app designer Scott Snibbe. As Bj√∂rk explains on the video: > This app is called 'Mutual Core' and it's about taking the tectonic plates > and pushing them together with effort until you create a mutual core beneath > them. In musicology-wise this is to teach you about chords, and you can use > [..] the tectonic plates, the strata inside them, and it sorta operates like > accordion so you can change the chords and push them together and [...] > create a mutual core. =Credits= * Bj√∂rk ‚Äì creative director * John Simon, Jr. ‚Äì creative director, software engineer Credits taken from \\"Mutual Core\\" app. Music video =Background and development= A music video for the song was commissioned by the director of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Jeffrey Deitch. The video was first revealed to be in the making in the September 2012 issue of Dazed & Confused, in an interview with director Andrew Thomas Huang. Huang was revealed to be chosen as the director for the video by Bj√∂rk herself, marking this the first of several future collaborations. Huang said about the making process: > \\"There's a lot of volcanic and earthy stuff in the video, we put Bj√∂rk in > quite a few uncomfortable set-ups when we were filming, but she was game for > anything. She was a lot of fun and just very warm and trusting.\\" The director also hinted at a parallelism between the video and its short film Solipsist, which was released weeks before the shooting of \\"Mutual Core\\" video: \\"[The song] is a metaphor between earth‚Äôs crust and two people converging, and the effort that it takes, that was also what Solipsist was about, so working together made sense\\". The video was shot in Reykjav√≠k in over two days. The director wrote the initial treatment for the video after visiting museums in London. The video features a mix of CG pictures and real natural elements, gathered by the team from different location in Iceland. The floating rocks in the video are made from foam and covered in plaster, fossilized barnacles and various textiles, the rock's tongues and the sand are computer animated; for this reason, the post-production lasted two months. Bj√∂rk's face motion was tracked in CG for the video, in which it appears to be melt in the rocks. Her costumes were inspired by Thai and Indonesian costumes, while the substance which resembles magma that she appears to spit in the video was a computer-modified mixture of ketchup and cake batter. A teaser trailer has been released on 5 November 2012. The teaser shows Bj√∂rk stuck in a bed of quicksand, wearing a blue wig. The video was premiered at an exclusive screening at the MOCA Grand Avenue on November 12, 2012. It was digitally released on November 13, 2012 on MOCA YouTube's channel, MOCAtv, as part of a series of music videos called ART+MUSIC which features collaborations between artists and musicians. The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day. The video features glimpses of filming and an interview with the director of the video, who explains the filming process. =Synopsis= A screenshot from the music video where Bj”ßrk sings surrounded by rocks under a rain of ashes. In the beginning of the video, soil crumbles down, as Bj√∂rk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Bj√∂rk, while strata emerges from them. In the end of the first verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Bj√∂rk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Bj√∂rk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Bj√∂rk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Bj√∂rk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Bj√∂rk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash. The video shifts again to Bj√∂rk buried in the sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Bj√∂rk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the floating rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During this part of the video, images of Bj√∂rk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Bj√∂rk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Bj√∂rk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke. =Reception and accolades= The video was heavily praised by critics. Bob Boilen of What Matters commented that the video is \\"a bit weird and smartly done\\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum stated that the video is \\"a beguilingly strange vision\\" and that \\"as the song unfolds, the images reach an explosive conclusion that resembles a fucked-up metal album cover\\", on a similar note, Gregory Adams of Exclaim! cited the video as \\"groundbreaking\\". A poster on The Huffington Post wrote that the video, which he billed as \\"hypnotic\\", \\"takes viewers on a strange spirit quest gone awry\\". Jonah Bayer of Myspace opined that \\"Bj√∂rk is a true artist, and her new video for ‚ÄúMutual Core‚Äù is ample evidence of that\\". Likewise, Sam Byford of The Verge stated that \\"Bj√∂rk has a history of stunning music videos, but she may have outdone herself with this latest effort\\", while Gary Pini of Paper billed the singer as a \\"master of both art and music\\". Judy Berman from Flavorwire found the video \\"a precise yet still poetic evocation of the track\\", while CraveOnline's Johnny Firecloud opined that \\"In her new video for \\"Mutual Core\\", Iceland's queen of bizarre takes her latest single from Biophilia and turns it into an intimate hallucinatory mingling of the elements\\". Chris Martins of Spin compared the video to the TV series Nova, stating that the video \\"might be the weirdest NOVA pilot ever created\\", later adding that Bj√∂rk \\"reinvents herself as the freakiest geology teacher the world's ever seen\\", an expression used also by io9 blogger George Dvorsky, who commented that \\"this stunning new video for \\"Mutual Core\\" makes us wish we had Bj√∂rk for a geology teacher\\". Brett Warner of Ology praised the director's work stating that \\"director Andrew Thomas Huang's gorgeous visuals will adeptly manage to both confuse the hell out of you and absolutely take your breath away\\". Abdullah Saeed of The Atlantic compared the video to her previous works and commented: > Back when she first began experimenting with electronic producer Mark Bell > on Homogenic, Cunningham style complemented her music perfectly for videos > like \\"All is Full of Love\\" Now, a decade and a half later, her music > explores biology, a discipline naturally interpreted by Huang‚Äôs visual > sense. [\\"Mutual Core\\"] represents a new level of quality and ingenuity from > Huang, who seems to be building on his now established visual style. On 24 December 2012, the video received two nominations at the 2012 Antville Music Video Awards in the categories of Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects. It went on to win the latter. The video was nominated for the Music Video of the Year category at the 19th Icelandic Music Awards, but lost to \\"Glow\\" by Retro Stefson.

The video received two nominations at the 2013 UK Music Video Awards for Best Visual Effects in a Video and Best Art Direction in a Video, winning none. However, Huang was nominated for his work in the video as Best New Director and went on to win the award. =Global projections= In March 2013, an edited version of the video was shown every night as part of a synchronized program on over 15 of the largest digital signs in Times Square, three minutes before midnight, as part of the Midnight Moment, a presentation of the Times Square Advertising Coalition (TSAC) and Times Square Arts. This Midnight Moment presentation is part of the New York City launch of Streaming Museum's Nordic Outbreak, an internationally touring exhibition of leading contemporary Nordic artists. Following the one-month exhibition in Times Square, a series of public programs and exhibitions took place across the city through 6 April at Scandinavia House, One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, Manhattan Bridge Archway, Big Screen Plaza, Tisch School of the Arts, and an event in the Sky Room at the New Museum. On July 1, 2013, it was announced that the projections would go global, with planned projections to take place throughout the 7 continents, including a screening in the only cinema of Antarctica. Also on tour is a film by David Bates, Jr. that show the projection of the video across the billboards in Times Square. Commenting on the choice of bringing Bj√∂rk's video projection worldwide, Nina Colosi, founder and creative director of Streaming Museum, stated: > In the music video Mutual Core directed by Andrew Thomas Huang, Bj√∂rk is > organically part of nature and universe. The human connection to nature is a > theme that underpins most of her artistic output. It‚Äôs particularly > meaningful to bring Bj√∂rk‚Äôs vision to 7 continents because of its relevance > to all cultures. =Credits= * Bj√∂rk ‚Äì starring role * Andrew Thomas Huang ‚Äì director * √Årni Bj√∂rn Helgason ‚Äì producer (Reykjav√≠k unit) * August Jakobsson ‚Äì director of photography (Reykjav√≠k unit) * Gus Olafsson ‚Äì production designer (Reykjav√≠k unit) * Frida Maria Hardardottir ‚Äì hair & makeup artist (Reykjav√≠k unit) * Laura Merians ‚Äì director of photography (Los Angeles unit) * Hugh Zeigler ‚Äì production designer (Los Angeles unit) * David Lyons ‚Äì visual effects executive producer * Michael Ranger ‚Äì lead CG supervisor * Lindsey Fry ‚Äì lead compositor * Nico Sugleris ‚Äì FX technical director * LARK Creative ‚Äì director representative Credits taken from the official music video on YouTube. Live performances Bj√∂rk premiered Biophilia's songs during the Manchester International Festival with a residency commissioned by the Festival itself. The singer played in a circular stage which included custom-made instruments like computer-controlled Pendulum Harps and a Tesla Coil, an instrument called Gameleste, an hybrid between a gamelan and a celesta, and a pin Barrel organ called Sharpsichord. The stage also included a circle of projection screens. During the \\"Mutual Core\\" performance, the screen projected images of moving tectonic plates, which Alan Pedder of the website Wearsthetrousers likened to \\"J√≥ga\\"'s music video, while the choir performed a sort of choreography, which included huddling at center stage during the verses and dancing during the chorus. The song was performed on every date of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance was well received by critics, which praised the whole show and project, which was called \\"ambitious\\". While reviewing Bj√∂rk's show at the New York Hall of Science, Will Hermes of the website PembrokeMayball stated that \\"during 'Mutual Core', she sang of tectonic plates under a circle of projection screens illustrating the phenomena, and licked her lips after a line about how 'the Atlantic ridge drifts' like she could feel that motion tingle beneath her skin\\". \\"Mutual Core\\" was added to the Vulnicura Tour set lists beginning with Bj√∂rk's headlining appearance at the Governors Ball Music Festival in New York on 6 June 2015, adding strings to the organ and choir parts of the original arrangement. The song also found its way onto Vulnicura Live, a collection of Bj√∂rk's favorite performances from her 2015 tour.

The museum was constructed by archaeologist Alfonso Kolling, who also led the archaeological excavations at the site. Current director is Klaus Kell. Exhibits The Museum shows the remains of a Roman vicus (country town) of approximately 2000 inhabitants which existed from the time of the birth of Christ until its destruction by the Alemanni in 275 A.D. Visitors can view the excavated buildings, grounds, roads and culverts. In the adjoining 18th century villa and the reconstructed houses of the vicus important finds from the everyday life of the Roman population are exhibited, found either at the settlement itself or in the surrounding area. At the front steps of the villa stand life- size replicas of Roman equestrian statues which were discovered in 1887 in nearby Breitfurt. The originals stood for many years at the entrance of the Historical Museum of the Palatinate in Speyer, but they were removed and placed in the courtyard of the museum under a canopy, since they were heavily weathered due to environmental factors. Villa Schwartzenacker Villa The early 18th Century (c. 1725) villa was designed by Jonas Erikson Sundahl. Besides the Roman exhibits, the villa also contains paintings by Johann Christian von Mannlich and other period painters of the region. The villa has a landscaped garden in the Baroque style, which was created following the excavation of the vicus.

As a contemporary composer, he has founded four different musical projects, including compositions for a symphony orchestra, rock drums, and piano.  Education  Havasi first played the piano at the age of 4. In 1996, at the age of 21, he was already a teacher at Weiner Le√≥ Conservatory. He then went on to study at Franz Liszt Academy of Music. His professors included then rector S√°ndor Falvai and Jen≈ë Jand√≥. During his years at the Academy of Music, Havasi won first prize at a piano competition of Yamaha Foundation of Europe. His musical development and career arc has been compared to Elton John.  Early albums (2000-2005)  In 2000, Havasi signed a five-year exclusive record contract with EMI. During the term of his EMI contract, he produced two soundtrack albums. Havasi did not extend the contract, instead establishing his own record company. Between 2005 and 2008, Havasi self-released the four solo piano albums Piano, Seven, Infinity, and RED.  The Unbending Trees  Havasi founded the band The Unbending Trees with singer-lyricist Krist√≥f Haj√≥s in 2006. The band was offered its first record contract by British record publisher and producer Ben Watt, and soon released its first album called Chemically Happy (Is The New Sad). Haj√≥s wrote lyrics to the music of Havasi on the album. The Unbending Trees made its debut in London in 2007 and its first four-song EP was called \\"The First Day\\". Later, their song \\"You Are A Lover\\" was reworked by British singer Tracey Thorn. The Guardian newspaper said of the collaboration that they found it \\"utterly beguiling\\". Their second album titled Meteor was released in 2013. Havasi Symphonic Production At his concert held in Dubai in May 2008, Havasi met musical producer Csaba Marjai, and the two began to collaborate on creating the Havasi Symphonic Production, which made its debut in the Grand Hall of the Hungarian Academy of Music in 2009. The production featured nearly 100 artists, Dohn√°nyi Symphony Orchestra and Budapest Academic Choir Society, together with almost 20 soloists of world music. At the premiere Havasi hit the same piano key 498 times in a single minute, surpassing the previous world record of 200. Verified by high definition camera, Guinness World Records Board awarded Havasi the title The Fastest Pianist of the World. The Havasi Symphonic Production has eleven platinum records. The Association of Hungarian Record Companies nominated the Havasi Symphonic album to the award 'Domestic Contemporary Classical Music Album of the Year'. As a part of his performances, he has collaborated with artists including Lisa Gerrard, Lebo M, Karl Jenkins, Leona Lewis, Ronan Keating, and Youssou N'Dour. Cultural Bridge Project In 2010, Havasi launched a large-scale cultural project, to pay tribute to his grandparents and build a cultural bridge between China and Europe. It debuted in Budapest in 2011. Led by Havasi, European and Hungarian musicians gave a joint artistic performance with Yunnan Art Group from China. About 150 entertainers appeared on stage at the same time.  Drum&Piano;  Havasi launched the Drum&Piano; Project with his friend, percussionist Endi Kiss.

Description The biological form of Typha minima is hemicryptophyte hydrophyte, meaning that they are plants with submerged overwintering buds, adapted to living in aquatic environments. Vegetative propagation takes place by means of a short 5 to 8 millimeters thick rhizome, that grow up to 20 cm deep in the ground. Typha minima is the smallest of the cattails. It reaches on average in height,Pignatti S. - Flora d'Italia ‚Äì Edagricole ‚Äì 1982. Vol. III, pag. 634 with a maximum of . The stem is erect and simple. The leaves are blue-green, linear, very narrow and not shiny. They reach up to in length and in width. Close-up of a seed spike of Typha minima These plants are monoecious, with the male and female reproductive structures borne on the same plant but packed into two separate inflorescences. The minute flowers are unisexual and wind- pollinated. Male (staminate) flowers are yellowish, while female (pistillate) flowers are greenish. The female inflorescence is brownish, ellipsoid, long, with an hairy rachis after the fall of the flowers. It is separated from the male inflorescence by a naked stem section, about long. The male inflorescence is thinner and longer, at the top of the vertical stem. The female flowers have one stalked ovary, surrounded by a thick fringe of hair. The three individual stamens of the male flowers are surrounded by just a few hairs. At the end of blooming the male flowers disperse, leaving the top of the stem naked, while the female inflorescence turns into a brown round seed spike. The main flowering period lasts from May through June. Another flowering period may occur in August. Distribution This rare plant is widespread in temperate Europe and Asia. The distribution is limited to the rivers of the Alps and the Apennines and to the Balkans, the Danube region and the mountains of central Asia. Habitat Typha minima is a light-loving plant and cannot tolerate shade. It grows on periodically flooded banks of slow flowing, cool and pure waters, along lake margins, in marshes, ponds and swamps, at an altitude of above sea level.

As of late December 2019, the company possesses 3,500 employees and a market cap of $565.4 million.  History  Sapiens grew out of an initiative, dubbed DB1, undertaken by a group of scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science during the 1970s to develop a novel object- oriented application generator for use with mainframe computers. One of the driving forces behind the initiative was Tsvi Misinai, a graduate of the Technion, who in 1972 spearheaded the project. He teamed up with Shai Sole, Shmuel Timor and Eli Raban. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Weizmann team, partnered with a local Israeli company, Advanced Automated Applications (AAA, which was founded by Tuvi Orbach), began marketing DB1 to large domestic organizations. Subsequently, the company started marketing its product overseas. In 1984, the Weizmann team established its own company, which was later merged with AAA and joined by entrepreneurs Ron Zuckerman and Shaul Shani. The company severed itself from the Weizmann Institute and was incorporated under its new name: Sapiens. One of Sapiens‚Äô first overseas clients was a UK-based international infrastructure firm in 1986. In 1992, shares of Sapiens began trading on the NASDAQ exchange. By 1993, Sapiens had 900 workers employed at 33 branches around the world and a market cap of $340 million.

The remake takes place in Detroit, Michigan in 1968 during the Motown era. The film stars Jordin Sparks, Derek Luke, Whitney Houston, Mike Epps, Cee Lo Green, Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, Tamela Mann and Omari Hardwick. Sparkle features songs from the original film written by soul musician Curtis Mayfield as well as new compositions by R&B; artist R. Kelly.‚ÄòSparkle‚Äôs‚Äô Brely Evans Says Give the Remake a Chance  EURweb This film is the debut of R&B;/pop singer and American Idol winner Jordin Sparks as an actress. Sparkle also marks Whitney Houston's fifth and final feature film role before her death on February 11, 2012, three months after filming ended. The film is dedicated to her memory. Plot Detroit, Michigan, 1968: A nightclub MC named Red (Terrence J) introduces a local singer Black (Cee Lo Green) who performs his song \\"I'm a Man\\". While Black performs Stix (Derek Luke), an aspiring record label executive is watching from the crowd. Meanwhile, 19 year old, Sparkle Anderson (Jordin Sparks) talks with her older sister, Tammy \\"Sister\\" Anderson (Carmen Ejogo), before she goes onstage. After performing Black encounters Sister and Sparkle backstage, attempting to flirt with Sister, but instead of accepting his advances, teases him by slitting the side of her mini-dress above the thigh, before walking on stage. Stix spots Sparkle and is instantly attracted to her. Sister does a solo performance singing a song Sparkle wrote titled \\"Yes I Do\\". Stix tries to get Sparkle's attention as she and Sister leave the club and rush home. As Sister and Sparkle arrive home, their sister Delores/Dee (Tika Sumpter) opens the door and they sneak upstairs to their room to avoid having their mother hear them come in. Emma (Whitney Houston), the girls' mother, walks into the girls' room and notices Sparkle, Sister and Dee in bed together, and demands that Sister and Sparkle prepare for bed and be ready for church in the morning. The next morning while at church Stix along with his cousin Levi (Omari Hardwick) spot Sister and Sparkle sitting in the choir. Levi tells Stix that Sister and Sparkle are siblings with musical talent, and Levi is interested in meeting Sister. After church Stix and Sparkle meet and talk for a while, as Emma notices and looks on disapprovingly. Ms. Waters (Tamela Mann) Emma's friend points out that Emma's oldest daughter Sister is almost 30, and due to a bad situation in New York City was forced to move back to Detroit to live with Emma. Later that night, Emma hosts a Bible study at her home in which both Levi and Stix are present. However, Levi takes the time to make a date with Sister who is uninterested and not participating in her mother's Bible study. After Emma and everyone leave the house, Stix secretly stays behind and notices Sparkle playing an original song that she wrote on a piano. Stix tries to encourage Sparkle to sing. A few nights later Stix comes to Sparkle's home to take her on a date at a nightclub. On the way home while sitting in front of Sparkle's home Stix tries again to encourage Sparkle to pursue a music career and tries to convince her to form a group with her sisters. Sparkle tells Stix that her mother was a singer, but almost died pursuing her dream. One day after church, Stix tries to convince Dee and Sister to form a music group with Sparkle. Sparkle becomes angry feeling that Stix has used her to speak with Dee and Sister about his plan. Dee explains that she will take part in order to make enough money for medical school, then will quit, while Sister is undecided as she will be starting a new job working at a department store. While at Emma's boutique, Ms. Waters shows Sparkle old photos of Emma with Sparkle's father and photos of Emma with Dee's father, explaining how different Emma was when she was with Sparkle and Sister's father. Sparkle leaves and goes to a record store where she sees Stix again. The two make up. While on a date Levi expresses his love to Sister, and hands her a small ring box which only contains a picture of a ring, as Levi promises to one day give Sister a real engagement ring once he could afford it. Moments later comedian Satin Struthers (Mike Epps) comes into the diner with his entourage, noticing Sister and Levi and begins to insult Levi for not being able to afford a real ring to give Sister. Sister has an immediate attraction to Satin. Satin photographs Sister as she exits the diner with Levi. After receiving her first paycheck from her new job which only amounts to $96, Sister is convinced by Sparkle that if they enter this local talent show they could win hundreds of dollars, which would finally help Sister move out of Emma's home. With Stix as their manager the three sisters enter the competition, and Sister wows the crowd with her sexually seductive lead performing \\"Hooked on Your Love\\". Satin watches Sister perform and is mesmerized as Levi becomes uncomfortable noticing the attention Sister is getting. The sisters become a popular act and are invited back to perform at clubs throughout Detroit. A montage of the sisters performing \\"Jump\\" at different clubs is shown. Sister, Sparkle, and Dee sit in a dressing room as Stix and Levi come to congratulate them on their performance. Levi hands Sister flowers, but Satin soon comes in giving Sister a ring which she accepts. Levi sees this gesture and becomes enraged and attempts to fight Satin, but is pulled away by Stix. Afterwards Levi confronts Stix about not sticking up for him during the fight with Satin. Emma invites her minister Reverend Bryce and friend Ms. Waters over for dinner after church, but the dinner is interrupted when Sister brings Satin whom she is now engaged to. Satin makes insulting and rude remarks at the dinner and Emma makes her dislike for him known to everyone at the table. In response, Sister lashes out at Emma criticizing her for having her as a teen then forcing Sister to raise Sparkle and Dee as Emma was out getting drunk and trying to pursue a music career. Emma responds that Sister isn't telling the whole story, and tells her that if she leaves with Satin she is never to come back. Sister packs her bags and leaves with Satin. Dee, Sparkle, and a visibly high Sister rehearse for a performance at Satin and Sister's home, until Satin comes into the room and interrupts wanting Dee and Sparkle to leave.

Sparkle and Dee realize that Satin has been beating Sister. Sparkle also notices that Sister has begun using cocaine.

After their performance, Stix introduces the girls to Columbia Records executive Larry who offers to sign them as a group. Dee and Sparkle try to get Sister to come home with them and leave Satin, but as they leave Sister spots Satin and goes back to him. At home Emma scolds Sparkle about her trying to pursue a career in the music industry, going as far as throwing a book which Sparkle has written song lyrics in the trash. Emma gives Sparkle an ultimatum that if she wants to continue living with her she must give up pursuing a music career. Satin is performing at a club, but his jokes are ill-received. Levi, who is sitting in the audience with a new woman, begins to mock him, to which an angered and annoyed Satin tries to attack Levi. Levi sees Sister walking out of the club and makes a remark to her. Satin and Sister run to Satin's car and drive home. At home Satin chases Sister through the home, beating her. Dee, Sparkle and Sister have a meeting with Columbia Records, Dee and Sparkle arrive and can't find Sister, but soon find her in a backroom beaten and looking for a cocaine fix. After hearing rumors that Sister is now an abused junkie, the rumors are confirmed when Stix, Larry, and Columbia executives find the sisters in the backroom and notice Sister beaten with cocaine in front of her. At Satin and Sister's home, Dee and Sparkle try to get Sister to leave and get help for her cocaine problem, but Satin shows up demanding Dee and Sparkle leave. When Dee and Sparkle insist they're not leaving without Sister, Satin punches Sparkle. Dee, Sister, and Sparkle all jump on Satin fighting him. Dee strikes Satin in the back of the head with a fire iron as he attempts to hit Sparkle again. Satin falls unconscious, and Dee tries to administer CPR, but the sisters realize Satin is dead. Sister orders Sparkle and Dee to leave the house. When the police arrive Sister is arrested and charged with manslaughter. As Sister's arrest makes newspaper headlines, Emma leads her church choir in a performance of \\"His Eye is on the Sparrow\\". After church Emma arrives home to find Dee packing up to leave. Dee tells Emma that she was accepted to Meharry Medical College, and must leave at that moment in order to start research for scholarships which will pay for her schooling. A proud Emma hugs Dee. Stix tries to get Sparkle to leave with him and get married. Sparkle however turns down Stix's proposal. Sparkle visits Sister in prison in which she tells that her and Stix broke up. Sister tells Sparkle not to visit her anymore as she doesn't want Sparkle to see her like that. Soon after Sparkle moves out of Emma's home renting her own apartment. Sparkle shows up at Columbia Records everyday until she gets a meeting with Larry. She convinces Larry to give her a shot, but she must first put on a musical showcase to seal the deal. Sparkle reaches out to Stix to help her set up her first solo concert. Sparkle goes back to her mother's home to invite her to see her show, but Emma seems uninterested. As Sparkle rehearses for her show Stix gives her a cupcake and a candy ring. Sparkle insists that he propose to her again. Sparkle performs \\"Look Into Your Heart\\" with Stix. Emma goes to visit Sister in prison, in which Sister states that Emma appears tired and worn out.

Pictures in 1976, starred Philip Michael Thomas, Irene Cara, Lonette McKee and Mary Alice, with songs and score composed and produced by Curtis Mayfield. One song from the Sparkle soundtrack, \\"Something He Can Feel\\", became a hit single for both Aretha Franklin (in 1976) and En Vogue (in 1992). =Production= In the mid-1990s, BrownHouse Productions, run by Whitney Houston and Debra Martin Chase (One of the producers of the film) secured the rights to a Sparkle remake from Warner Bros. Houston had intended to cast R&B; singer Aaliyah in the lead role as Sparkle, but due to Aaliyah's untimely death in August 2001, before the film went into production plans to remake the film was put on hold. In 2005, it was revealed Raven-Symon√© was cast in the leading role. Following the 2011 release of their first feature, Jumping the Broom, Salim Akil and Mara Brock Akil, the creative team behind the TV series The Game and Girlfriends, took on Sparkle as their next project, with Houston executive producing and starring as the mother of the three girls. Production for the film began on October 10, 2011, in Detroit. Filming wrapped up in early November 2011, with a release date scheduled for August 17, 2012. The official trailer for Sparkle was released on April 2, 2012, and premiered on TodayWhitney Houston shines in exclusive clip from final film 'Sparkle' - TODAY EntertainmentSparkle Official Trailer #1 - Whitney Houston Movie (2012) HD - YouTube with the release of the trailer the films producer Debra Martin Chase said she had mixed emotions with the trailer's release \\"On the one hand, I'm so excited about the movie and we're really happy with how it turned out,\\" she said. \\"(But) just to have it said yet again that this is Whitney's last performance, it's hard. It's hard.\\" Howard Rosenman, the original's producer-writer and executive producer of the 2012 version of Sparkle, reported that novelization rights of the movie were sold to Simon & Schuster. The book, written by Denene Millner, was published on August 7. 2012. Rosenman said Houston was influenced by the original movie as a girl and once went to see it every day for a week when she was a teenager. It apparently helped plant the dream in her to become a singer. When the new version was coming together, Rosenman approached her to play the girls' mother. She has two musical numbers in the film and on the soundtrack. Rosenman plans to team with director Joel Schumacher, one of the screenwriters of the original 1976 movie, to add five new songs to those by Curtis Mayfield (in the original) and R. Kelly (in the 2012 version) for a Broadway musical of Sparkle. Release In December 2011, Sony announced the United States release date for Sparkle would be set for August 10, 2012. This was later pushed back by a week to August 17, 2012, due to Whitney Houston's death.Release Date For \\"Sparkle\\" Remake Gets Pushed Back  Shadow and Act Reception The film got mixed to positive reviews. Sparkle received an A on Cinemascore. Critic reviews for Sparkle so far have been generally mixed to positive, receiving a 58% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and a critical consensus stating: \\"While undeniably melodramatic and old-fashioned, Sparkle transcends its formulaic trappings thanks to Salim Akil's empathetic direction and strong performances from a committed cast\\", based on 92 reviews with an average rating of 5.7/10. Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 25 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Critical praise has been particularly been given to Carmen Ejogo's performance. Film critic Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film 3 stars, claiming Ejojo \\"steals the film not only in her sultry singing numbers but in her violent marriage to a snaky, evil comedian named Satin.\\" While giving the film a negative review, The Globe and Mail critic Courtney Shea stated Ejogo, in comparison to Sparks' performance, was \\"in fact more dynamic, sexy and, dare we say, Bootylicious than the real thing ‚Äì plays hardened vulnerability to perfection, so much so that you wonder (given her 38 years) where Hollywood has been hiding her.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle went as far as to suggest in his review that Ejogo's performance might place her under serious consideration for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. LaSalle comments: \\"...very few people will walk out of Sparkle talking about either Sparks or Houston, at least not at first.

This music festival began in 1993 on an early summer weekend, and has continued to occur on the same weekend every year since. The festival has taken place in Pentecost since 2016. This is the most visited jazz festival in all of Germany. History The music festival is based on the Jazz Rally of Brussels and was initially held during June 25 to 27 of 1993 under the name Brussels Jazz Rally. [1] [2] The ninth edition of the D√ºsseldorfer Jazz Rally lasted from June 25 to July 1, 2001. During this specific edition of the music festival, the concerts began taking place partly outdoors, despite intermittent rains the festival had 280,000 people in attendance. [3] In recent years, the number of visitors is regularly a quarter of a million of people of more. [4] =Sparda Jazz Award= Since 2012, a Jazz Award has been annually awarded to a young, talented, jazz musician aged 18 to 28 years old. The sponsor of this award is the Foundation for Arts, Culture and Social Affairs of Sparda Bank West. [5] The three top finishers will receive, in addition to a live performance during the rally, a cash prize of $3435.97 for first place and a cash prize of $1717.99 for both second and third place. The panel of judges consists of either 4 or 5 judges that are generally musicians, jazz producers, music journalists, or the board of the Sparda-West-Stiftung. There are two permanent members of the judges panel and they are patron Klaus Doldinger and board of the foundation member, Ursula Wi√üborn. This competition has had several celebrity hosts, including: pianist Sebastian Gahler in 2013, jazz producer Rudiger Herzog in 2014, and WDR music journalist Karsten M√ºtzelfeldt in 2014. Initially, this competition was intended to last for three years, but it was extended for two years until 2018. [5] Additionally, it will begin on June 6, 2019 and end on June 9, 2019.

Transportation is an additional cost, so most people travel by foot. The quick foot travel was the inspiration for the Rally portion of the festival's name. Although the festival is predominately geared toward Jazz, it features a variety of music genres, ranging from pop to rock. [6] Ticketing Information Visitors of the festival are able to see several concerts for free during each day of the festival. The festival requires a single ticket for an entire day of concerts, this is referred to as Tagesticket or a one-day ticket. Festival-goers are also welcome to purchase the Jazz Rally Button, which consists of a 3-day ticket and free transportation via the VRR.

Staged, since 1953, in Frankfurt-am-Main, it is the oldest German Jazz Festival and it is the oldest continually-held jazz festival in the world. History The festival was first organised by the German Jazz Federation as an exhibition aiming to showcase the best that Germany had to offer in jazz, as explained by Olaf Hudtwalcker at the opening of the first festival (3 May 1953). In fact, there was no significant German musician that has not played at the Frankfurt Festival. The festival was in the 1950s the annual jazz event in West-Germany and provided the main impetus for German jazz. With the advent of other festivals in the 1960s, the festival had to take more into account the international scene. Most significant German musicians, however, were away from the everyday routine, collaborating with prominent jazz musicians from Europe and non-European countries, especially in North America. The festival allowed the meeting of Volker Kriegel with Alan Skidmore (1972), Heinz Sauer with George Adams (1978), Peter Giger with Archie Shepp (1980), Alfred Harth with David Murray (1995) and Eberhard Weber with Pharoah Sanders (1997). Caterina Valente, Theo J√∂rgensmann, Markus Stockhausen, Lauren Newton, Christof Lauer, Michael Sagmeister, Torsten de Winkel and Christopher Dell all started out at the festival as \\"newcomers\\". In the course of its existence, the central organization of the festival has changed: The German Jazz Federation no longer belongs to the organizers; unlike its first decades it is no longer organised by Lippmann and Rau. 1984 saw the local broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk becoming the organizer of the festival, and since 1990 the City of Frankfurt itself has acted as a solid partner. The festival is now fully broadcast on the radio. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the event was held every two years. Since the early 1990s, it is again being held annually, just as it was in the first decade of its existence. Sources * J√ºrgen Schwab: Der Frankfurt-Sound. Eine Stadt und ihre Jazzgeschichte(n).

While women such as Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald were famous for their jazz singing, women have achieved much less recognition for their contributions as composers, bandleaders and instrumental performers. Other notable jazz women include piano player Lil Hardin Armstrong and jazz songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. History =United States= With women‚Äôs suffrage at its peak with the ratification of the United States Nineteenth Amendment on 18 August 1920 and the development of the liberated flapper persona, women began to make a statement within society. In the \\"Jazz Age\\", women took a greater part in the workforce after the end of the First World War, giving them more independence. There were many more possibilities for women in terms of social life and entertainment. Ideas such as equality and freer sexuality began to spread and women took on new roles. The 1920s saw the emergence of many famous women musicians including African-American blues singer Bessie Smith (1894‚Äì1937), who inspired singers from later eras, including Billie Holiday (1915‚Äì1959) and Janis Joplin (1943‚Äì1970).Ward, Larry F. \\"Bessie\\", Notes, Volume 61, Number 2, December 2004, pp. 458‚Äì460 (review). Music Library Association. In the time of the 1920s, women singing Jazz music was not common but women playing instruments to jazz music was even less common. Mary Lou Williams, known for the talent of playing the piano is deemed as one of the mothers of jazz due to the contributions of the new tones she provided by singing while playing the piano. Lovie Austin (1887‚Äì1972) was a piano player and bandleader. Pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong (1898‚Äì1971) was originally a member of King Oliver's band with Louis Armstrong and went on to play piano in Armstrong's band the Hot Five and then his next group, the Hot Seven.Borzillo, Carrie, \\"Women in Jazz: Music on Their Terms--As Gender Bias Fades, New Artists Emerge\\", Billboard 108:26 (29 June 1996), pp. 1, 94‚Äì96. Valaida Snow (1904‚Äì1956) became so famous as a trumpet player that she was known as \\"Little Louis\\".Richard Williams, \\"Trumpet queen\\" (review of Valaida by Candace Allen), The Guardian, 14 February 2004. It was not until the 1930s and 1940s that many women jazz singers such as Billie Holiday were recognized as successful artists in the music world. Billie Holiday‚Äôs music rose to fame following the Great Depression. She, along with several male artists, added a new flavor to the sounds of jazz that become known as swing music. This music brought in heavier use of a band of instruments as well as many artists then began playing music in addition to already singing. These women were persistent in striving to make their names known in the music industry and lead the way for many more women artists to come. While jazz songwriting has long been a male-dominated field, there have been a few notable women jazz songwriters. Irene Higginbotham (1918‚Äì1988) wrote almost 50 songs, her best- known being \\"Good Morning Heartache\\".Ted Gioia, \\"Five women songwriters who helped shape the sound of jazz\\", OUP Blog, 12 March 2013. Accessed on 15 October 2015. Ann Ronell (1905‚Äì1993) is known for her 1932 hit song \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" and the 1933 Disney song \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\". Dorothy Fields (1905‚Äì1974) wrote the lyrics for more than 400 songs, some of which were played by Duke Ellington. She co-wrote \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" with Jerome Kern, which won the 1936 Oscar for Best Song. She co-wrote several jazz standards with Jimmy McHugh, such as \\"Exactly Like You\\". \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" and \\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\\". Lil Hardin Armstrong's a most famous song, \\"Struttin‚Äô with Some Barbecue\\", has been recorded 500 times. Her other notable songs are ‚ÄúDoin‚Äô the Suzie Q\\", \\"Just for a Thrill\\" and \\"Bad Boy\\". While Billie Holiday is best known as a singer, she co-wrote \\"God Bless the Child\\" and \\"Don't Explain\\" with Arthur Herzog, Jr. and she penned the blues song \\"Fine and Mellow\\". Activism Within the early industry of jazz, possessing masculinity was viewed as a preference that made women in jazz struggle for recognition. Many musicians began taking the discussion of inequality from the musical aspect and applying those same concepts in becoming an activist. Several women in jazz were activists either for gender equality or racial equality and often both. Once jazz music transitioned from the 1920s to the ‚Äô50s, many black female artists began singing more in the style of R&B; blues as well as folk jazz. Nina Simone was hailed as setting a prominent precedent for other artists as she modeled what was called the new style of jazz. Her style was also around the time of the popular Civil Rights Movement that peaked in the late 1950s and continued through the '60s. In 1964, Simone performed at Carnegie Hall in front of an all-white audience. One of the songs she chose to sing was \\"Mississippi Goddam\\", which expounded on the racial injustice of blacks living in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Although those listening were an all- white audience, many responded with interest and concern rather than criticism which added another layer to the culture of jazz within the civil rights era. Jazz became a unifying concept among contrasting races and cultures and Simone‚Äôs popular anthems continued to be a product of the issues surrounding the Civil Rights Movement and the injustices that were displayed. Billie Holiday was another prominent female jazz singer who provided an effective notion to the Civil Rights Movement in her song \\"Strange Fruit\\". Through an emotional and metaphorical narration, Holiday's song depicts the vision and harsh reality of blacks being lynched as a result of racism. Holiday performed the song nearly every night she went on stage, thus shaping the song to become a popular melody. This melody slowly began to be associated heavily with civil rights protests and was often used by well-known activists such as Malcolm X. Role of women Historically, women performers in jazz have been mostly singers, among them Ella Fitzgerald (1917‚Äì1996), Billie Holiday, Baby Esther, Carmen McRae (1920‚Äì1994), Dinah Washington (1924‚Äì1963), Sarah Vaughan (1924‚Äì1990), Betty Carter (1929‚Äì1998), Anita O'Day (1919‚Äì2006), Abbey Lincoln (1930‚Äì2010), Nancy Wilson (1937-2018), Diane Schuur (born 1953), Diana Krall (born 1964), and Gretchen Parlato (born 1976). However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders: *Toshiko Akiyoshi (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Melissa Aldana (tenor saxophone, and bandleader) *Lil Hardin Armstrong (piano, composer, arranger, and bandleader) *Lynne Arriale (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Dorothy Ashby (harp, composer, and bandleader) *Lovie Austin (piano and bandleader) *Sweet Emma Barrett (piano) *Carla Bley (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Jane Ira Bloom (soprano saxophone, composer, and bandleader) *Joanne Brackeen (piano, composer] *Jane Bunnett (saxophone, flute, piano, and bandleader) *Judy Carmichael (piano, bandleader, and vocalist) *Terri Lyne Carrington (drums) *Barbara Carroll (piano, bandleader) *Regina Carter (jazz violin) *Anat Cohen (clarinet, tenor and soprano saxophones, and bandleader) *Alice Coltrane (harp, composer, and bandleader) *Roxy Coss (saxophone, flute) *Blossom Dearie (piano, vocalist, and bandleader) *Dena DeRose (piano, vocalist) *Dorothy Donegan (piano, vocalist) *Eliane Elias (piano, vocalist, composer, arranger) *Mary Fettig (saxophone, flute) *Linda Fredriksson (composer, bandleader, saxophones) *Mimi Fox (guitar, and bandleader) *Scheila Gonzalez (saxophones, woodwinds) *Mary Halvorson (guitar, and bandleader) *Jutta Hipp (Piano) *Holly Hofmann (flute) *Shirley Horn (piano) *Bobbi Humphrey (flute) *Margie Hyams (piano, and vibraphone) *Ingrid Jensen (trumpet) *Dolly Jones (trumpet) *Yoko Kanno (composer, arranger, and bandleader) *Grace Kelly (saxophone) *Joelle Khoury (piano and composer) *Jeanette Kimball (piano) *Kristin Korb (bass, vocalist, bandleader, and composer) *Diana Krall (piano, vocalist, and bandleader) *Katia Labeque (piano) *Melba Liston (trombone, arranger, composer, and bandleader) *Marilyn Mazur (drums, percussion) *Marian McPartland (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Mary Ann McSweeney (bass, composer,and bandleader) *Myra Melford (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Linda Oh (bass, composer, and bandleader) *Mary Osborne (guitar, and bandleader) *Nicki Parrott (bass, vocalist, and bandleader) *Ann Patterson (saxophones, woodwinds) *Billie Pierce (piano) *Terry Pollard (piano, vibraphone, and bandleader) *Vi Redd (alto saxophone, and bandleader) *Emily Remler (guitar, and bandleader) *Renee Rosnes (piano, composer, arranger, and bandleader) *Stacy Rowles (trumpet) *Patrice Rushen (piano, composer, arranger, and bandleader) *Adele Sauros (composer, bandleader, saxophones, flute) *Maria Schneider (composer, arranger, and bandleader) *Hazel Scott (classical piano, singer, and actor) *Nina Simone (piano, vocalist, and bandleader) *Esperanza Spalding (bassist, vocalist, and composer) *Katie Thiroux (bass, vocalist) *Hiromi Uehara (piano, composer, and bandleader) *Mary Lou Williams (piano, arranger, bandleader, composer) *Deanna Witkowski (piano, composer, and bandleader0 *Krzysia G√≥rniak (guitar, composer, arranger, bandleader) *Sacha Boutros (composer, songwriter, vocalist, producer, piano and bandleader) There have also been all-female jazz bands, such as The International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Factors contributing to lower participation and recognition According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London‚Äôs The Independent, women musicians are \\"too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\\", and they face pressure \\"to look sexy onstage and in photos.\\"\\"Classical music's shocking gender gap\\", CBC Music, 19 March 2014. Duchen states that while \\"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\\" According to the UK's BBC Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being a bandleader.Jessica Duchen, \\"Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end\\", The Guardian, 28 February 2015. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process. \\"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\"\\"In Search of Women In American Song; A neglected musical heritage\\", Parlor Songs. According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the \\"lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage.\\" Women \\"struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th-century Tin Pan Alley. Prior to 1900 and even after 1900, it was expected that \\"women would perform music, not make music.\\" In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote Women In Music, in which he argued that \\"women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music\\" due to \\"biological predisposition\\". Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field \\"to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\\" The \\"secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women.\\" In the mid-19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including Faustina Hasse Hodges, Susan Parkhurst, Augusta Browne and Marion Dix Sullivan. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but \\"many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials\\" to hide the fact that they were women. However, in recent times, women have employed jazz music as creating movements and awareness of the sexism and misogyny within the jazz industry. A group of women called ‚ÄúWe Have a Voice Collective‚Äù aims to bring attention and appreciation for the women associated with jazz music past and present.

It has been the terminus of line S 11 of the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn (now part of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn) since 1 June 1975. This service now runs via Cologne, Neuss and D√ºsseldorf to D√ºsseldorf Airport Terminal station. It also includes the city‚Äôs freight yard. The section of the S√ºlz Valley Railway between K√∂ln-M√ºlheim station and Bergisch Gladbach is electrified. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 6 station. The station has eight operable tracks, one with a platform and overhead wiring for S-Bahn traffic, the rest serve the freight yard. Other tracks in the freight yard and sidings are no longer needed and have been dismantled or are no longer used. The station entrance is controlled by a historic mechanical signal box, which has been in use since 1911 and is now a heritage-listed building. Adjacent to the S-Bahn platform is a bus station with 14 bus bays, which is served by 20 bus lines during the day and 6 night bus lines. History The station was opened in 1868, together with the K√∂ln-M√ºlheim‚ÄìBergisch Gladbach line. In 1870, a line was built from the entrance of Bergisch Gladbach station to Bensberg, requiring trains running to Bensberg to reverse in the station. Due to the increased size of the station a signal box was opened in 1890 at the station entrance on the island between the line to K√∂ln-M√ºlheim, the line to Bensberg and the Tannenbergstra√üe level crossing. From 1912 until 1960 there was a connecting curve at Gronau junction so that reversal at the station could be avoided. During the establishment of the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn, the S√ºlz Valley Railway between K√∂ln-M√ºlheim and Bergisch Gladbach was electrified in 1974-75. Electrification in Bergisch Gladbach station itself, however, was limited to the track serving S-Bahn platform and one other track, which has since been closed.

For a long time it was an opportunity for a German audience to learn about the latest developments not only in the U.S. but also in different parts of Europe and the former Soviet Union.

The OffsideOpen International New Music Festival Gelderland, also known as Offside Festival, was a jazz festival in the German- Dutch border region. It was founded by Burkhard Hennen in 2007, and then took place again in 2008. The three day festival in August was organizationally supported by the cities of Geldern, Straelen, as well as the dutch city of Arcen. The festival was financed by donations from private donors. Burkhard Hennen, founder and artistic director of the Moers Festival from 1972 to 2005, had a vision for a new type of festival. For example, instead of having fast food stands, like at the Moers Festival, volunteers served food from the Lower Rhine region. The 200+ volunteers help with the infrastructure and logistics of the festival, which helped Hennen in making his decision to support this specific festival out of all other initiatives. Offside Festival 2008, Mars Williams Quartet From the 17th to the 19th of August, the festival took place on three different stages. More than 200 international musicians took part in the cross-border concert. A special attraction was the 40 or so membered Shibusashirazu Orchestra from Japan, who Henne had discovein Yokohama. The ensemble started off their European tour at the Offside Festival, additionally they stayed in the area for 5 days and held concerts, including one at a local school. Hennen asked for the next festival to take place at a later date, because he was having difficulties with the finances. However, the other organizations were in favor of a yearly festival. For this reason, Hennen stepped down from his position of artistic director in July 2008, so Rainer Hannsen was appointed to fill this position. They then changed the name from OffsideOpen (Hennen's name) to Offside. Offside 2008 took place from 22nd to 24th of August on Holl√§nder See with Gunter Hampel, Klaus Doldinger, Jazzkantine, Mars Williams, among many other musicians. The festival was no longer able to continue the following years due to many sponsors dropping out.

Folia Litteraria Polonica, vol. 26, issue 4, 2014, pp.149-160 (in Polish) *Quote: Jego pierwsza prezentacja nastƒÖpi≈Ça rok wcze≈õniej [1934] w \\"Czytance dla II klasy szk√≥≈Ç powszechnych miejskich\\" opracowanej przez . It is about a little black boy called Bambo, who lives in Africa. The poem is sixteen lines long, arranged in eight rhyming couplets. It tells the story of Bambo, a young black African child, who diligently studies in an African school. When he returns home, he fools around and is told off by his mother. He reacts by frowning. When offered milk by his mother, he runs off and climbs a tree. His mother tells him to have a bath, but he is afraid that he will whiten. His mother loves him though. The poem ends by saying that it is a pity that \\"black, happy Bambo\\" doesn't go to school with us. Meaning of Murzynek The poem refers to Bambo as Murzynek, the diminutive form of Murzyn. Murzynek can be translated into English in a variety of ways, such as \\"black child\\" or \\"little Negro\\". The word \\"Murzyn\\", which in the opinion of many Poles, including academics, is not offensive, is seen by some black people as discriminatory and derogatory. The word was derived from borrowing the German word Mohr, which derived from Latin maurus, similar to the English word 'moor'. Analysis The poem is familiar to the most of Polish childrenCzy \\"Murzynek Bambo\\" obra≈ºa Afrykan√≥w?, Gazeta.pl (in Polish).

The phrase Murzynek Bambo is often used in children's name-calling when the target is a black child. Others argue that the poem should be seen in the context of its time, and that commentators should not go overboard in analysing it.Murzynek Bambo dla licealist√≥w? , Colemi.pl (in Polish) A journalist Adam Kowalczyk says that he \\"did not become a racist\\" because of reading the poem.Huckleberry Finn a Murzynek Bambo, Debata.olsztyn.pl (in Polish) A reader of Gazeta Wyborcza, Ewa Trzeszczkowska, describes in a letter how she identifies with Bambo: \\"For me, this work was and is a cheerful story about a naughty boy from a distant, exotic country, that, although so distant ‚Äì both the country and the boy ‚Äì is also similar to me.

The article deals with the series' main and recurring characters.  Main characters  = Peter \\"Pete\\" Lattimer = = Myka Ophelia Bering = = Arthur \\"Artie\\" Nielsen = = Leena = = Daniel Dickinson = Daniel Dickinson (Simon Reynolds) was the Deputy Director at Secret Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Prior to Pete and Myka's reassignment to Warehouse 13, he is their boss. He is not happy about losing two of his best agents to some bizarre warehouse in South Dakota, unaware of its importance, and is initially determined to get them back, especially after facts about Artie's past come to light. Eventually, he sees his former agents are committed to their new positions, and they part ways. In the Season 2 episode \\"Vendetta\\", he is murdered for his knowledge about Artie's past. = Claudia Donovan = = Steven \\"Steve\\" Jinks = Steven Jinks (Aaron Ashmore) is a former U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent who was recruited by Irene Frederic after having been told by Artie the nature of Warehouse 13. Jinks was intended to be Agent Bering's replacement, but after she returned to the Warehouse Agent Bering and Agent Lattimer resumed working as a team out in the field while he does any fieldwork with Claudia Donovan if multiple artifacts need to be retrieved at one time. Agent Jinks also has the perfect ability to tell when someone is lying; even if the person lying is a master of deception, he would still be able to tell. However, certain artifacts, such as Richard Nixon's shoes, could nullify the ability. This power has other limitations: Steve seems to be unable to sense general deception, only baldfaced lies; in some ways this makes his power more limited and easier to bypass than Pete Lattimer's vibes or Leena's aura-reading ability. Someone aware of this limitation can use it against him, as Sally Stukowski did. Steve's power seems to need some concentration in order to work; it is active rather than passive. As revealed in \\"The New Guy\\", Steve is a Buddhist. The centeredness this gives him apparently makes it possible for him to work the Feng Shui Spiral as Leena did; it is unknown whether any other current Warehouse employee can also successfully do this. In \\"Trials\\", Steve revealed to Claudia that he is gay after Claudia thought he was hitting on her. In \\"Love Sick\\", Steve revealed to Pete and Myka that he is gay, while Pete & Myka were in a state of drunkenness brought about by contact with W.C. Fields' juggling balls, they inadvertently lured Steve into the bronzing chamber, and temporarily bronzed him. After recovering from their drunkenness, they retraced their movements in the Warehouse and ultimately debronzed Steve. In \\"Queen For A Day\\", it was revealed that Steve had an older sister named Olivia Jinks. Steve's older sister Olivia, who frequently got him out of trouble when he was a kid, was killed at the age of twenty by a stray bullet. Her death is the reason Steve joined ATF, and Claudia reminds Steve of her. In \\"The 40th Floor\\", Pete, Myka, and Steve were sent to apprehend Sally Stukowski. After successfully captured, Stukowski was interrogated first by Artie and then by Mrs. Frederic. During the interrogation, Mrs. Frederic employed a dark artifact to extract information. Steve protested the use of torture on Stukowski and attempted to dissuade Mrs. Frederic from continuing to use the artifact. When she refused, Steve drew his service pistol, and in the ensuing confrontation, Stukowski managed to escape from custody. As result of his insubordination, Mrs. Frederic fired Agent Jinks. In \\"Insatiable\\", Steve is shown in a bar, where he attempts to purchase a drink but is refused due to his credit card being burned out. Marcus Diamond shows up and offers to pay off Steve's bar tab. He then proceeds to try to get Jinks to join A to Z Technologies. Steve eventually acquiesces. In \\"Emily Lake\\", it was revealed that Jinks was working undercover for the Warehouse all the time, his \\"firing\\" and \\"defection\\" being part of a plan conceived by Jane Lattimer and Mrs. Frederic, but he ended up dead at the airport due to an \\"undetected heart defect\\" in the end, presumably caused by the same lethal injection that was used to kill Sally Stukowski. In \\"An Evil Within\\", Steve was brought back to life using Johann Maelzel's Metronome, with the help of Claudia and Jane. He had no recollection of being dead and was unaware of his death until he notices the metronome. Angry and confused, he heads towards the patio where he sits and talks with Claudia about how he has trouble dealing with what just happened. Later on in the episode, it is decided that since the side-effects of the metronome are currently unknown, Steve is to be placed under constant supervision. He is last seen going to dinner with the rest of the agents. In \\"Personal Effects\\", he discovers the side effect of using the metronome is that injuries he sustains will impact Claudia rather than himself. In \\"There's Always a Downside\\", Steve reveals to Myka his potentially dangerous connection with Claudia and the metronome, and how he hasn't yet told Claudia about it. Myka urges him to start looking for a solution that doesn't involve him taking himself off of the metronome - advice which he takes, suggesting to Artie at the end of the episode that he would like to take some time away from missions, processing information about the metronome. In \\"Fractures\\", Steve finally reveals to Claudia the connection that the metronome has given them, after Claudia feels the pain of a stab wound that Steve received protecting Artie. Claudia doesn't seem surprised to receive the news, but says that Steve should've told her. Claudia gets upset when Steve says that he wanted to disconnect himself from the metronome before telling her, and says that now that she knows, they can work as a team to figure out what to do about the connection. In \\"Second Chance\\", Steve and Claudia travel to Steve's hometown to visit his mother and see about getting him off the metronome. It is revealed that Steve and his mother have a complicated relationship, but the only way to get him off the metronome is for him to perform a complete act of love towards her. He ends up throwing the metronome against the fireplace, shattering it in a burst of light, and miraculously, starts breathing on his own. In \\"Runaway\\", Steve's (presumably most recent) ex-boyfriend is revealed to be Liam Napier, a U.S. Marshal who assists the team in covering up the involvement of an artifact in an Arkansas jailbreak. During Claudia's birthday party, he admits that he said a really good goodbye to Liam. Claudia, Pete, and Myka eventually find out that he 'slept' with Liam and congratulate him happily. Jinks' status in the Warehouse computer is currently listed as \\"Un- Deceased.\\" The QR code shown in 'Personal Effects' reads verbatim: \\"Steven Jinks (W13 Agent NXN43772632-30032). Murdered by Walter Sykes. Revived.\\"  Recurring warehouse personnel  = Warehouse agents =  Helena G. Wells   James MacPherson  James MacPherson (Roger Rees) is a former Warehouse Agent who was Artie Nielsen's partner. According to his backstory, he and Artie had a falling out, fifteen years previously, when MacPherson used the \\"Phoenix\\" artifact to rescue his wife, Carol Augustine (Lynne Cormack), from a fire that killed five firefighters (whenever the Phoenix is used to save a life, at least one other person must die). MacPherson went to prison, but he escaped two years later and disappeared. He returns in Season 1 as Artie's nemesis. He is acquiring and selling Warehouse artifacts to release them back into the world. He demonstrates a great wealth of knowledge of paranormal artifacts, which he uses to accomplish his goals. Though numerous attempts have been made to capture him over the years, he remains at large until the Season 2 premiere, \\"Time Will Tell\\", when he is killed in the Warehouse. In the following episode, his ghost seems to haunt the Warehouse but is seen only by Artie. His ghost's last act is to lead Artie to his room at Leena's‚Äîduplicated and stored in the Warehouse like all former agents‚Äîto show him a pocket watch that the two of them had apparently argued over; the watch is accompanied by a note willing it to Artie. We learn in the Season 4 premiere, \\"A New Hope\\", that the watch is the key to the location of a device having the power to reverse the destruction wrought by Walter Sykes, in the Season 3 finale. In the Season 3 episode, \\"The Greatest Gift\\", Pete accidentally uses a Christmas artifact to create a parallel timeline where MacPherson is in charge of the Warehouse, Artie has been banished from the Warehouse and imprisoned, and Myka and Claudia were never recruited into the Warehouse. Pete, as the only one who remembered the original universe, gathered his team together to fight MacPherson. MacPherson killed Artie in the same way he himself died in the original universe, moments before Pete erased the alternate universe and restored the original timeline.  Hugo Miller  Hugo Miller (Ren√© Auberjonois) was a computer genius and Warehouse Agent in the late 1970s. In his quest to create a virtual artificial intelligence (AI), he attempted to use an artifact to copy his mind into the Warehouse software, which failed. He did succeed in transferring (not copying) half his mind, causing him to be committed to a mental hospital. In Season 2, when the dormant AI emerged and took control of the Warehouse, Artie and the team used the artifact to reverse the process and restore Hugo's mind. He reappears in the Season 3 episode \\"Love Sick\\" to help Artie when an artifact-enhanced computer virus begins to infect people, leading to the cellular degeneration of their bodies and eventually death. It is revealed in the same episode that he had a relationship with Vanessa Calder when they were both active Warehouse Agents.  Rebecca St. Clair  Rebecca St. Clair (1929‚Äì2010) (Roberta Maxwell), was a former Warehouse Agent under an unknown last name (although she is called Agent St. Clair in the episode \\"3... 2... 1\\"). Her years of service are unknown, though it is established she was already an agent in 1961. She left Warehouse 13 after the disappearance of her partner and lover, Jack Secord. She changed her last name and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1965, where she worked as an elementary school teacher until retirement. She twice assists Agents Lattimer and Bering in solving various cases (episodes \\"Burnout\\" and \\"Where and When\\"). Stricken with terminal cancer, she dies while going back in time to 1961, using H.G. Wells' Time Machine to spend her final moments with Jack. The young Rebecca (Alex Paxton-Beesley) appears in flashback in the episodes \\"Where and When\\" and \\"3... 2... 1\\".  Jack Secord  Jack Secord (Chad Connell), was a former U.S. Marine and Secret Service Agent; it was said that he received \\"vibes\\" similar to later Warehouse Agent Pete Lattimer. He was recruited by the Warehouse in 1955 and went missing in 1962. In the episode \\"Burnout\\", his body is found sealed up in an abandoned cellar, an act of self-sacrifice to entomb a dangerous artifact that had attached itself to his body. He was romantically involved with his partner Rebecca (St. Clair). Jack's character is seen in flashback in the episodes \\"Where and When\\" and \\"3...2...1.\\" = Warehouse Caretakers =  Mrs. Irene Frederic  Mrs. Irene Frederic (C. C. H. Pounder) is the director of the Warehouse program, and Caretaker of Warehouse 13. A shadowy figure who suddenly appears and disappears, she is Artie's immediate superior, and answers to the Regents. As the Caretaker, some sort of mental link exists between her and the Warehouse, giving her, among other advantages, a full mental inventory of all artifacts in Warehouse 13. Another result of this is that her life and the Warehouse's life are linked; if one dies, both die. As such, she is immune to natural death, resulting in her appearance never changing in spite of her advanced age. In the \\"Pilot\\" episode, Dickinson's research uncovers that she worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s. It is revealed in the season 2 episode \\"Where and When\\" that she has been in charge at the Warehouse since at least 1961. Mrs. Frederic had at least one child, a son, but in the season 4 episode \\"No Pain, No Gain\\" we learn that she has long outlived him. She maintains a current relationship with her grandson, who is now an elderly man. In the Season 3 finale, Mrs. Frederic dies because of the Warehouse's destruction, her body aging into a skeleton to indicate her long life. In the Season 4 premiere, Artie uses Magellan's astrolabe to reverse time, restore the Warehouse, and undo her death. Because of Artie's behavioral change regarding H.G. Wells, Mrs. Frederic suspects that Artie has \\"done something\\" hinting that she may know that he used the astrolabe. She shows Artie that one of the braids in her hair is now silver, enhancing her suspicions. Mrs. Frederic begins to teach Claudia how to be a caretaker, showing her an artifact being born when a woman is wounded saving a baby during a store robbery. But she also shows the downside of the position by visiting a nursing home where Mrs. Frederic's grandson (who appears to be in his 60s) resides, showing the consequences of a long life.  Paracelsus  Paracelsus (Anthony Stewart Head) is an incarcerated \\"bronzed\\" alchemist, whom Nick tricked Claudia into releasing. He is the brother of Sutton, and the reason for his family's immortality. He was a former director of the Warehouse program, and the Caretaker of Warehouse 9. He is stated as being the creator of the Philosopher's stone. After he is debronzed, he pieces together the two halves of the stone and makes Sutton, Nick, and Charlotte mortal once again. He escapes before Myka and Pete can stop him and goes to San Francisco. He heals cancer patients with the stone, only to sacrifice them once again in order to achieve immortality. He could \\"see\\" people through their eyes, namely their health. = Warehouse regents =  Benedict Valda  Benedict Valda (Mark Sheppard) was the most frequently seen Regent through the series' first two seasons. The Regents are the executive board of the Warehouses. Valda first appeared in the season 1 episode \\"Breakdown\\", in which the Regents question Artie about his capability. This was Artie's first meeting with the Regents. Valda appeared more frequently in season 2; in \\"Beyond Our Control\\", he joins Mrs. Frederic in an attempt to remove MacPherson's energy from Leena's brain using a combination of artifacts, while in \\"Around the Bend\\", he is introduced to Pete, Myka, and Claudia, and becomes the target of Pete's temporary insanity. In the season 2 episode \\"Buried\\" Valda is revealed to be the Regents' expert on Warehouse 2. He sacrifices himself in the Warehouse's Hallway of Death trap to allow Pete, Myka, and Helena to move on. His voice is briefly heard when Artie watches Leena's statement (that all employees of the Warehouse record upon joining, stating they understand the risks of the job), interviewing her.  Adwin Kosan  Adwin Kosan (Faran Tahir) is the highest ranking Warehouse Regent and the primary decision-maker for personnel matters. Kosan approved the reinstatement to active duty of Helena G. Wells and Myka Bering. In Season 3, he is one of the few Regents to survive the attacks orchestrated by Walter Sykes. When meeting with other Regents, he uses a business card with the name \\"Diana K Snow\\", which is an anagram for Adwin Kosan.  Theodora Stanton  Theodora Stanton (Paula Boudreau) is a Warehouse Regent who appears in the episodes \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Trials\\", and \\"The 40th Floor\\"; she is also the proprietor of Ted's Restaurant in Univille. She is one of the Regents who approved Myka Bering‚Äôs reinstatement to the Warehouse following her temporary leave. Using the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire doorknob, Sally Stukowski (Ashley Williams) tortures and kills her during Walter Sykes' reign of terror. While under duress, she gives up the location where three fellow Regents are sheltered.  Lok Archer  Lok Archer (name of both character and actor) is a Warehouse Regent who appears briefly in the episodes \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Trials\\", and \\"Shadows\\". In the later episode he is seen only as a corpse after having been murdered by Walter Sykes. It is from Archer that Sykes learns of the ancient regent sanctum and the portal into Warehouse 13.  Jane Lattimer  Jane Lattimer (Kate Mulgrew) is a Warehouse Regent and the Guardian. She is also the mother of agent Pete Lattimer. She has kept many secrets about Warehouse 13, which, at first, left Pete feeling he does not really know her. They take a trip back to memory lane in the episode \\"Shadows\\", which helps him to understand she was only trying to protect him. All Regents are selected for their areas of expertise; Jane's is dealing with children. In \\"The 40th Floor\\", she becomes the Guardian of Warehouse 13 and is entrusted with the Remati Shackle, which is the last line of defense for Warehouse 13 in the face of disaster.  Mr. Keeler  Mr. Keeler (Jeffery R. Smith) is a Warehouse Regent who appears in the episodes \\"Emily Lake\\", \\"A New Hope\\", and \\"Endless Wonder\\". He is the manager of the Valu-Mart in Elk Ridge, South Dakota, which is a cover for the Regent Vault that once safeguarded the Janus Coin containing the essence of Helena G. Wells. Keeler also has a Master of History degree from the fictional South Dakota University, Rapid City, where he has access to a private Regent Library. Keeler, along with Leena (Genelle Williams), plays an important role in decoding the location of the alidade to Ferdinand Magellan's astrolabe. He and Leena also research the artifact, Gandhi‚Äôs dhoti, used to defuse Walter Sykes' bomb. He is killed by Benedict Valda (from Paracelsus' alternate timeline, not the real Valda) in an Endless Wonder. = Other personnel =  Dr. Abigail Cho  Dr. Abigail Cho (Kelly Hu) is introduced in the Season 4 episode \\"The Sky's the Limit\\" as the new proprietess of Leena's Bed and Breakfast. She is a former Warehouse psychologist whom the regents brought out of retirement to help Artie deal with his grief over Leena's death and, more generally, to assess and aid in the mental well-being of all Warehouse 13 personnel. She is officially revealed to be \\"The Keeper\\", a failsafe of all classified information regarding the entire history of the Warehouses 1‚Äì13.  Dr. Vanessa Calder  Dr. Vanessa Calder (Lindsay Wagner) is the official Warehouse physician and, as a cover, works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Artie, who is attracted to Vanessa, was using an artifact to regrow his appendix every year for Vanessa to remove, until he was emboldened by Pete's advice to ask her on a date. Vanessa and Artie have feelings for each other, which they finally admit at the end of the \\"Love Sick\\" episode. Vanessa was also called upon in the episode \\"Buried\\" to care for Mrs. Frederic when her brain was being eclipsed by Warehouse 2; she was prepared to transfer the status of Caretaker from Mrs. Frederic to Claudia, but this was resolved when Warehouse 2 was shut down. Dr. Calder also appears in the Alphas episode \\"Never Let Me Go\\", establishing that, along with Eureka, Alphas takes place in the same continuity as Warehouse 13.  Other recurring characters  = Family members =  Joshua Donovan  Joshua Donovan (Tyler Hynes), Claudia Donovan's older brother who also possesses unusually high IQ. He is a long-time friend of Arthur Nielsen and formerly the prot√©g√© of Professor Reynolds (a pseudonym for MacPherson). In college, he conducted experiments with teleportation using Rheticus' Compass, attempting to use it before finding all of the instructions and was believed dead after activating the device. Claudia and Artie discovered that Joshua had been suspended in inter-dimensional limbo and carried out the final instruction to bring Josh back to the corporeal realm.

He is regarded as the founder of the Cotton Belt Route, a major railroad system connecting Texas and Arkansas north to St. Louis, Missouri. Douglas' parents Alexander and Margaret Douglas moved their family from South Carolina to Talladega, Alabama in 1838 and then to Texas in 1847, settling in Tyler in 1848. After his father died in 1854, Douglas supported the family by working as a school principal while reading law. In 1859 he purchased half-ownership in the Tyler Reporter newspaper (now the Tyler Courier-Times) and became its editor.Texas State Historical Society, The Handbook of Texas Online, article \\"James Postell Douglas\\" accessed 2011-09-24 After the Civil War broke out, Douglas helped raise a battery of artillery and became a first lieutenant. The only battery of Texas artillery to serve east of the Mississippi River, the First Texas Battery saw action throughout the war. Douglas was promoted to captain in July 1862. The battery was paroled in May 1865 in Mobile, Alabama and Douglas returned to Texas. Douglas returned to being a newspaper editor. In 1870 he was elected to the Texas Senate, where he was a strong opponent of Reconstruction. Railroad ventures Douglas owned farms and canneries around Tyler (as well as possibly the first peach orchard in East Texas) and was interested in finding better outlets for his produce. Douglas petitioned the Texas legislature for a railroad charter in 1870, and the legislature granted one at the end of 1871. After many difficulties in raising sufficient funds in Reconstruction Texas, construction finally began in 1875 and the railroad began operation in 1877. This was the Tyler Tap, basis of the later Cotton Belt Route. Douglas was still unable to pay off his investors, and so he organized a new venture with businessmen from St. Louis, the Texas and St. Louis. The Texas and St. Louis was to extend the Tyler Tap to Texarkana to connect more directly to eastern markets. Douglas served as the first president of the Texas and St. Louis from 1879 to 1880, before becoming involved with a different railroad scheme. In 1880 Douglas became the first president of the Texas and Gulf Short Line Railroad, which proposed to connect Tyler to Sabine Pass on the Gulf of Mexico. The company shortened the task by purchasing an existing horsecar line which had track running to Rusk, Texas. Douglas remained president until 1883, at which point the railroad had 61 miles of track. All three railroads came under the control of Jay Gould around 1890 and were organized into the Cotton Belt Route or St. Louis Southwestern Railroad.80 Years of Transportation Progress: A History of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway In 1889 Douglas and some associates organized a smaller scale enterprise - the Tyler Street Railroad Company. By 1891 the company had about 3 miles of track and 4 mule-drawn cars. The line apparently shut down in 1894, perhaps a victim of the Panic of 1893.\\"East Texas Tales: First street cars mule powered\\", Kelly Gooch, Tyler Morning Telegraph, June 22, 2014 Family and legacy Douglas married twice. He married his first wife, Sallie Susan White, on March 24, 1864; she died August 22, 1872. They had four children together. He married his second wife Alice Earle Smith on July 7, 1874, and they had six children. She survived him by many years, dying June 28,1955.Website with biography of Texas Senate district 6 officeholders In 1952 she was presented with a special 75 year service pin by the president of the Cotton Belt Route, in memory of her husband's part in the founding of the line. The Tyler branch of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is named in his honor, as is the Douglas Elementary School in Tyler. Further reading Douglas's Texas Battery, CSA (ed.

The name \\"Hyatt 10\\" was coined because the press conference where the concerned officials announced their resignation was held at the then-Hyatt Regency Hotel (now Midas Hotel) in Pasay City. The group continues to be influential in Philippine politics, with several members having joined the government of President Benigno Aquino III, Arroyo's successor. Members There were originally ten members of the Hyatt 10: *Corazon \\"Dinky\\" Soliman, Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development *Emilia Boncodin, Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management *Florencio Abad, Secretary of the Department of Education *Cesar Purisima, Secretary of the Department of Finance *Rene Villa, Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform *Juan Santos, Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry *Imelda Nicolas, Lead Convenor of the National Anti-Poverty Commission *Guillermo Parayno, Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue *Alberto Lina, Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs *Teresita Deles, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process It is believed however that there are more than ten members in the Hyatt 10: Soliman once claimed in 2006 that not only was the Hyatt 10 \\"intact\\", but that the group included \\"more than 200 other persons who had filed or signed impeachment complaints against Ms. Arroyo\\". Several members of the Hyatt 10 have since returned to government service under the administration of President Benigno Aquino III, appointed because he believed it would be \\"liberating\\" for them to do what they wanted to do in their respective offices, which he claimed they could not do under the previous administration. Corazon Soliman, Cesar Purisima, Alberto Lina and Teresita Deles had since been reappointed to the posts they occupied before resigning in 2005. Florencio Abad served as the Secretary of Budget and Management, Imelda Nicolas was chairwoman of the Commission on Filipinos Overseas, and Rene Villa was appointed to the board of directors of the Local Water Utilities Administration, replacing Prospero Pichay, Jr. Criticisms There have been recent criticisms against several members of the Hyatt 10.

The displays include a collection of naval models which dates back to late 17th century. The museum is based in S√∏kv√¶sthuset, a former naval hospice which overlooks Christianshavn Canal. The museum is a branch of the Museum of Military History which also includes the T√∏jhus Museum at Slotsholmen and two museum ships, the frigate HDMS Peder Skram and the submarine HDMS S√¶len, both located at Holmen. History The museum traces its history back to the foundation of the Royal Model Collection which dates back to the 17th century when it became common practice to build accurate models of ships, or detail models of components of them or their fittings, as part of the ship building process. In 1773 the collection was installed at Gammelholm but later passed into oblivion. The 1830s saw a renewed interest in ship models, both the historic ones and of new ships, and the collection was finally installed once again in 1862. In 1894, a new building for the Royal Model Collection was constructed at Holmen. In 1940, the collection was evacuated and put in storge out of fear that it would be destroyed in the event of a German attack on the Danish Navy. After the Liberation in 1945, its building had been taken into use for other purposes. The museum was founded 1957 at the initiative of Vice Admiral A.H. Vedel and found a temporary home in St. Nicolas Church. In 1974 a branch of the museum opened at Valdemars Castle on the island of T√•singe which mainly focussed on the naval hero Niels Juel who had owned the estate in the middle of the 17th century. In 1984 the temporary premises at St. Nicolas' closed and the exhibition moved to a building at Christianshavn Rampart at Christianshavn. In 1884 the south wing of S√∏kv√¶sthuset was put at the disposal of the museum which reopened at its new premises on 4 October 1989. Building The wing with the Naval Museum The building was designed by J. C. Conradi and completed in 1755 as the home of the Royal Orphanage (da. Det Kongelige Opfostringshus) which had been founded a few years earlier and took care of the upbringing of sons of single parents from poor backgrounds. In 1775 the institution moved to new premises in Store Kongensgade and the building was instead converted into a new home for the Royal Naval Hospice which had until then been located at Sankt Ann√¶ Plads. The wing toward B√•dsmandsstr√¶de, which now houses the Naval Museum, was built in 1781 by the mason J. B. Schottmann (1734-1786). The long building stands in yellow-dressed masonry with light grey pilasters. The rounded pediment is decorated with war trophies. Exhibition A model of Phoenix =Model Collections= The oldest ship in the Model Collection is an unnamed vessel from the 1660s with a bust resembling Niels Juel decorating its Transom. The collection consists of several hundred large and small models, ranging from fully rigged ships of the line to over model docks to various detail models. A common trait of the models is that they display fine craftsmanship and an immense richness of details. The models served as a sort of \\"blue prints\\" and are therefore crafted in accurate scale. The museum has also acquired several modern models of contemporary naval vessels, including a model of a flixible support ship of the Absalon class. =Artifacts, marine painting and maps= Old Dock, not far from the current museum building (c. 1750) The exhibitions also comprise a vast number of weapons, uniforms and artifacts such as navigational equipment and tools. The museum also holds a large number of artworks which depict naval history. Represented artists include Christian M√∏lsted, Anthon Melbye and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. =Dioramas= Apart from the collections, the museum also use diorama of important naval battles and mock-ups to present the history of the Danish Navy. Children's museum Historic ships at Holmen The museum also takes in three decommissioned naval ships of the Cold War era which are docked at Nyholm. They can only be visited during the summer months (June-August) and on limited opening hours. During opening hours visitors are free to walk around the largest of the ships, FDMS Peder Skram, a Peder Skram class frigate, while the two others, HDMS S√¶len, a submarine, and HDMS Sehested'', a Willemose- class missile boat, can only be visited on tours. They start every 30 minutes during opening hours and are available in English. The opening hours for the ships are: June: S√¶len and Sehested: Weekends from 11.00 am - 5 pm.

It is a rebranded variant of iOS, the operating system used by Apple's iPhones, renamed to reflect the diverging features of the two product lines, particularly the iPad's multitasking capabilities and support for keyboard use. It was introduced as iPadOS 13 in 2019, reflecting its status as the successor to iOS 12 for the iPad, at the company's 2019 Worldwide Developers Conference. The current version is iPadOS 14.1, released on October 20, 2020.  History  The first iPad was released in 2010 and ran iPhone OS 3.2, which added support for the larger device to the operating system, previously only used on the iPhone and iPod Touch. This shared operating system was rebranded as \\"iOS\\" with the release of iOS 4. The operating system initially had rough feature parity running on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, with variations in user interface depending on screen size, and minor differences in the selection of apps included. However, over time, the variant of iOS for the iPad incorporated a growing set of differentiating features, such as picture-in-picture, the ability to display multiple running apps simultaneously (both introduced with iOS 9 in 2015), drag and drop, and a dock that more closely resembled the one in macOS than the one on the iPhone (added in 2017 with iOS 11). Standard iPad apps were increasingly designed to support the optional use of a keyboard. To emphasize the different feature set available on the iPad, and to signal their intention to develop the platforms in divergent directions, at WWDC 2019 Apple announced that the variant of iOS that runs on the iPad would be rebranded as \\"iPadOS\\". The new naming strategy began with iPadOS 13.1, in 2019. On June 22, 2020, at WWDC 2020, Apple announced iPadOS 14, with compact designs for search, Siri, and calls, improved app designs, handwriting recognition, better AR features, enhanced privacy protections, and app widgets. iPadOS 14 was released to the public on September 16, 2020.  Features  Many features of iPadOS are also available on iOS; however, iPadOS contains some features that are not available in iOS and lacks some features that are available in iOS. = Home Screen = Unlike previous versions of iOS, the icon grid displays up to five rows and six columns of apps, regardless of whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation. The first page of the home screen can be configured to show a column of widgets from applications for easy access. Spotlight Search is no longer part of the widgets but can still be accessed by swiping down from the center of the home screen or pressing Command + Space on a connected keyboard. = Multitasking = iPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS, with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously. Double-clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces. Each space can feature a single app, or a Split View featuring two apps. The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time, or swipe left/right with four fingers. While using an app, swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock, where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over. Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View, which will allow both apps to be used side-by-side. The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill-shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app. If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app, it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen. A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen, and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it. Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows. A pill-shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over. The user can now have several instances of a single app open at once. A new Expos√© mode has been added which allows the user to see all of the instances of an app. In many applications, a notable exception being YouTube, videos can be shrunk down into a picture-in-picture window so the user can continue watching it while using other apps. This window containing the video can be resized by pinching and spreading and can be docked to any of the four corners of the screen. It can also be hidden by swiping it off the side of the screen and is denoted by an arrow at the edge where the video is hidden and swiping it will bring it back onscreen. = Safari = Safari now shows desktop versions of websites by default, includes a download manager, and has 30 new keyboard shortcuts if an external keyboard is connected. = Sidecar = Sidecar allows for an iPad to function as a second monitor for macOS, named in reference to articulated motorcycles. When using Sidecar, the Apple Pencil can be used to emulate a graphics tablet for applications like Photoshop. This feature is only supported on iPads that support the Apple Pencil. However, earlier versions of iPadOS 13 allowed all iPads compatible with iPadOS 13 to work with Sidecar. = Storage = iPadOS allows external storage, such as USB flash drives, portable hard drives, and solid state drives to be connected to an iPad via the Files app. The iPad Pro (3rd generation) connects over USB-C, but the Lightning camera connection kit also works to connect external drives with previous iPads. = Mouse and trackpad support = Mouse and trackpad support was added in version 13.4. = Scribble = Introduced in iPadOS 14, Scribble converts text handwritten by an Apple Pencil into typed text in any text field.

Completed in 1971, it consists of four separate blocks linked together by walls and courtyards.\\"Can Lis\\" , Dansk Arkitectur Center. Retrieved 24 September 2011. History Utzon visited Majorca in 1966 when returning from Australia after disagreements with the authorities about how to complete his iconic Sydney Opera House. He was enchanted by the island and decided to build a summer residence there. The basic concept of the villa is similar to the design for the house Utzon had intended to build in Sydney: a number of pavilions arranged to serve the different functions of the building. \\"Can Lis and Can Feliz in Mallorca\\". Stories of Houses. Retrieved 24 September 2011 Architecture Loggias provide shade from the sun Located on the top of a cliff on the island's south coast, the house is built in the area's yellowish- pink sandstone, known locally as mar√©s stone, making it blend into the landscape. The concrete roof is capped with of yellow tiles while the gables are crafted in the Chinese style, like those of the Fredensborg Houses. The four separate blocks are linked together with walls and courtyards. From west to east, the first block houses the kitchen, dining room and study, the second the living room, the third the bedrooms and the fourth contains a guest suite.Kenneth Frampton, \\"The Architecture of J√∏rn Utzon\\" , Pritzker Architecture Prize. Retrieved 27 September 2011. All face the sea with slightly different orientations following the line of the cliffs. Utzon prepared preliminary sketches and drawings but these were underwent changes as the building grew. The result is a house that makes optimum use of light and views. Utzon's approach is reminiscent of the experience he had gained in Finland where he saw how Alvar Aalto had built the Villa Mairea, altering the design along the way. The light in Majorca is sharp and bright. Can Lis has a number of areas where loggias and projecting roofs provide the necessary shade. The window frames, mounted on the exterior surface of the walls, stimulate the effect of light inside the house. Most of the furniture is also made of stone, sculpted into shelving, tables, chairs and benches. In his extensive monograph on Utzon, Richard Weston considers Can Lis to be \\"one of the finest houses built in the twentieth century.\\" He further comments: \\"Uniting mental and physical order, geometry and building, Utzon has made a house unmistakenly modern in technique and sensibility yet seemingly as natural and ordinary as the sun, stone and sea whose intercourse it celebrates.\\"Richard Weston, Utzon: Inspiration, Vision, Architecture, Hellerup, Denmark, Edition Bl√∏ndal, 2001, Page 388. Later developments The Utzons kept Can Lis as their Majorca residence for almost 20 years, living there for extensive periods as they grew older. They finally decided to build a second house on the island, Can Feliz, at a more remote location, as they were increasingly bothered by the continual pounding of the waves, the glare of the sun, and intrusions by tourists and architecture enthusiasts who wandered through the site.\\"J√∏rn Utzon, 2003 laureate, Biography\\", PritzkerPrize.com.

Built in 1880, it was renamed after Rani Sylvia Brooke, wife of Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke, in 1925. During the 1960s, the fort housed the District Office and the District Court House, and later the Resident‚Äôs Office when Kapit Division was formed in 1973. In May 1997, the Sarawak state government gave approval for the monument to be managed by the Tun Jugah Foundation and to set up a museum within the fort itself. The Tun Jugah Foundation was given the responsibility of conservation and renovation works, which commenced immediately and was completed by December 1998. History To prevent further Iban migration upriver in the Rajang River basin, which was creating conflicts with the Orang Ulu, Rajah Charles Brooke built Baleh Fort at Nanga Balleh, the confluence of the Rejang and Baleh rivers between Kanowit and Song in late 1874. Rajah Charles Brooke nearly drowned here in 1877 when his boat capsized in the dangerous currents. He abandoned the fort in 1878, and replaced it with a new fort located lower down the river in 1880. The new Kapit Fort was built entirely of ‚Äòbelian‚Äô (ironwood) timber with thick walls to withstand attacks. On 16 November 1924, a peacekeeping ceremony between the Iban, Kayan, Kenyah and Kajang was held here in the presence of Rajah Charles Brooke. In 1925, Kapit Fort was renamed Fort Sylvia after Rani Sylvia Brooke. During the 1960s, the fort housed the District Office and the District Court House, and later the Resident‚Äôs Office when Kapit Division was formed in 1973. Museum The Tun Jugah Foundation converted Fort Sylvia into a museum and fountain of history in Kapit town. It consists of many sections listed as below. =History= This section depicts the history of Kapit, history of Fort Sylvia, and the colonial days. The exhibits include photographs and copies of documents relating to the section. Some of the photographs on display are the 1924 Peace-Making ceremony; a group photograph of Sir Charles Vyner Brooke together with Ranee Sylvia Brooke, Temenggong Koh and Tedong ak Barieng; a photograph of Domingo de Rozario; a group photograph taken outside Fort Sylvia; and a photograph of Temenggong Koh, Malcolm MacDonald and TunJugah anak Barieng. =Community Wall of Fame= It is a display of the photographs of community leaders or famous historical figures of various community groups including Iban, Orang Ulu, Malays and Chinese. Among the Iban leaders are Tun Jugah anak Barieng, Temenggong Koh ak Jubang, Temenggong Sibat ak Buyong, and Temenggong Jinggut ak Attan. Among the Chinese community are Kapitan Ah Wai, Tan Guan Hock and Tan Sit Leong. Among the Orang Ulu are Penghulu Hang Nyipa, Penghulu Puso Abun and Matu Puso. Malay leaders include Radin Yusop bin Radin Salleh. Datuk Abang Abdul Gapor bin Abang Tek, Datu Abang Ahmad bin Datu Abang Abdul Gapor, and Datuk Abang Indih bin Datu Abang Gapor. =Tun Jugah Gallery= This gallery displays photographs and mementos of the late Tun Jugah anak Barieng. Among the mementos are uniforms, medals, sword, and other personal possessions of the late Tun Jugah. To complement the gallery, there are other exhibits like plates and ceramics, jars, and canons. A bronze bust of Tun Jugah is also displayed on the first floor. =Iban Costumes and Textiles= A selection of pua‚Äô kumbu‚Äô pieces, in silk and cotton are on display here. Among the pieces is a silk piece entitled \`Kara‚Äô jangkit‚Äô woven by an accomplished weaver, Gading ak Mayau from Sungai Kain, Kapit. Iban costumes are also on display here. =Mural Painting of the Iban World= The largest exhibit in the Museum is a mural painting, depicting the Iban way of life. =Hall of Fame= To show the past contributions of the community and other people who has served and are still serving in Kapit Division, the museum has put up four pieces of brass plaques listing the names of District Officers, Residents, Community leaders, Penghulus, Sarawak Rangers, First Malaysia Rangers, other Regiments, and Iban Trackers. =Amber Gallery= Located at the ground floor of the building, the gallery is a joint effort between the Tun Jugah Foundation and the Geological Survey Department in Kuching. The exhibits consist of raw Sarawak amber, polished Sarawak amber, and amber carvings. The raw amber is supplied by Global Minerals Sdn. Bhd., obtained from the Merit Pila Coal mine near Kapit and were selected by the Geological Survey group. The polished amber pieces were done by Mr. James Loh, from the Geological Survey department. The amber carvings were done by Mr. Kojan Kabeng, a local carver and artist from Punan Bah. One of the world‚Äôs largest amber deposits was discovered recently in the Merit-Pila Coal Field along the Batang Rejang. The largest piece of amber in the world was found here. The amber is derived from fossilised resin. Based on geological evidence, the age of the amber is estimated to be Miocene (approximately 20 million years old). Many fossilised insects were observed in Sarawak amber, trapped approximately 20 million years ago when the resin was initially accumulated and perfectly preserved to this day. So far, the insects found in amber were spiders, ants, mosquitoes, centipedes, wasps and beetles. The colours of amber vary from black to whitish and sometimes with shades of orange, red, yellow and brown. They can be either opaque or transparent. =Weaving / Handicraft Workshop= One of the objectives of the Tun Jugah Foundation is to preserve and promote the development of the indigenous ikat weaving of the Iban. Right behind the Reception on the Ground Floor is the ruai where there are exhibits on Iban weaving. On display are weaving tools and implements; and raw materials for making pua kumbu. Opportunities are given to organisations like Sarakup Indu Dayak Sarawak in Kapit who wish to conduct weaving workshops, exhibitions and competitions. A number of weavers from Kapit are affiliated to the Tun Jugah Foundation. They are Gading ak Mayau, Bidah ak Unjong, Tegok ak Sabut and Anchang ak Tun Jugah. Puan Siah ak Tun Jugah is a consultant at the Tun Jugah Foundation on adat and rites relating to pua. Another corner is allocated for those who wish to conduct other handicraft workshops like bead-work, basketry and carving. =Other Rooms= There is a Conference Room located on the ground floor which can accommodate about 30 people to conduct scholarly discourse on arts and culture. On the first floor, there is an adjoining Discussion and Function Room, which can by used for receiving important officials and academics, and at the same time provide a venue for discussion and meetings. The Ranee Suite is used as a venue for recording of oral research. One of the objectives of the Tun Jugah Foundation is to collect, transcribe and publish Iban oral literature. There is also a Reader‚Äôs Corner located at the first floor where a collection of books on the Brookes, Sarawak history, crafts, books written in Iban, oral literature and other publications are provided as reading materials. Among these are books published by the Tun Jugah Foundation. Most of the Foundation‚Äôs forthcoming publications are also available for readers once they are printed.

It is found mainly in Southern Ontario. Toronto pork packer William Davies, who came to Canada from England in 1854, is credited with its development. The name \\"peameal bacon\\" derives from the historic practice of rolling the cured and trimmed boneless loin in dried and ground yellow peas to extend shelf life. Since the end of World War I, it has been rolled in ground yellow cornmeal. Peameal bacon sandwiches, consisting of cooked peameal bacon on a kaiser roll and sometimes topped with mustard or other toppings, are often considered a signature dish of Toronto, particularly from Toronto's St. Lawrence Market. Description and name alt=black frying pan on black stovetop, with eight slices of peameal bacon Peameal bacon is a type of unsmoked back bacon. It is made from centre-cut pork loin, trimmed of fat, wet-cured in a salt-and-sugar brine and rolled in cornmeal. It can be sliced and cooked on a grill, griddled or fried; or roasted then sliced and served. The brining process makes it nearly impossible to overcook. The low fat content keeps it juicy, and the cornmeal gives it a crispy edge. Cooked peameal bacon has a mild salty-sweet flavour and tastes more like fresh ham (when compared to smoked back bacon or side bacon). The cooked slices have been described as resembling small pork cutlets. It is eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner, served in slices or as an ingredient in a pork dish. The name peameal comes from the dried yellow peas that were ground into meal and packed around the meat to preserve it in the Victorian era. This has since been replaced by cornmeal, but the original name remains. Peameal bacon is rarely found outside of Southern Ontario, and is often simply referred to as \\"back bacon\\". Similarly, a peameal bacon sandwich is often called \\"back bacon on a bun\\". Some Americans refer to peameal bacon as Canadian bacon. However, this should not be confused with Canadian-style bacon or Canadian back bacon, which are terms used by the US-based North American Meat Institute for an American style of smoked back bacon. This may be sold in US supermarkets as \\"Canadian bacon\\", though it is not in any way Canadian. Americans use these names to differentiate from what they call American bacon, a US term for side bacon ( streaky bacon). History William Davies Company stall at St. Lawrence Market. Peameal bacon was associated with the Toronto-based William Davies Company. The origins of peameal bacon have not been firmly established. Curing pork with brine has been practiced for centuries, in many parts of the world. Peameal bacon has been linked to pork- packer William Davies and the Toronto-based William Davies Company, though it is uncertain if the process was invented by Davies, an employee, or if it was otherwise acquired by the company. Davies immigrated to Canada from Britain in 1854, and set up a shop in Toronto's St. Lawrence Market. According to Toronto's oral history, Davies sent a side of brine-cured pork loins to relatives in England. To help preserve this shipment, he packed it in ground yellow peas. This was well received and Davies continued rolling cured loins in pea meal to extend shelf life. The William Davies Company expanded, forming Canada's first major chain of food stores, and becoming the largest pork exporter in the British Empire. By the early 1900s, the company's Front Street plant processed nearly half a million hogs per year. This contributed to Toronto's longstanding nickname of \\"Hogtown\\". Following World War I, cornmeal replaced the pea meal crust, due to the former's availability and improved refrigeration practices. Sandwiches In the 1960s, customers of Joe Hoiner's St. Lawrence Market butcher shop opted for the centre cut of cured peameal loins, leaving him with the ends. He partnered with Elso Biancolin, who ran a bakery shop at the market, and they sliced and fried the bacon ends and sold them on buns. Biancolin's sons, Robert and Maurice, expanded the family's Carousel Bakery during the market's 1977 renovation, and their featured peameal bacon sandwich on a fresh kaiser roll received national and international attention from food critics and TV chefs. It is noted in many tourist guides and visiting chefs often seek it out. Slices of peameal bacon served on a soft roll bun The Carousel Bakery's peameal bacon sandwich is simple, without complicated sauces, toppings or layers. It is composed of slices of peameal bacon cooked on a griddle long enough to crisp, drizzled with honey mustard, served on a soft fresh roll. There are options to add an egg or side bacon. It was served at the inaugural Canadian Comedy Awards in 2000. In 2016, the peameal bacon sandwich was named Toronto's signature dish. This was announced by Mayor John Tory at a local food festival with several versions offered. Peameal bacon sandwiches were included in a wager between Tory and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf during the 2019 NBA Finals. Nutrition Because peameal bacon is lean, it compares favourably to side bacon and is less processed than turkey bacon. While turkey bacon has a healthier image, popular brands have higher sodium and carbohydrates from added corn syrup. Nutritionist Theresa Albert compared samples (about 4 slices of side bacon or turkey bacon, and 2 thick slices of peameal bacon): *turkey bacon: 382 calories, 2,285 mg of sodium, 3.1 g of carbohydrates and 28 g of fat *side bacon: 541 calories, 1,717 mg of sodium, 1.4 g of carbohydrates and 42 g of fat *peameal bacon: 157 calories, 904 mg of sodium, 1.7 g of carbohydrates and 7 g of fat In 2018, a laboratory analysis was conducted on Carousel Bakery's peameal bacon sandwich. It found the sandwich to have 499 calories, 2,520 mg of sodium, 49 g of carbohydrates, 8 g of fat, and 57 g of protein. Dietitian Shannon Crocker felt the calories and protein would make it a satisfying meal, but the sodium was 10% above the maximum recommended daily limit.

All three work at a department store, where Janie has been made treasurer of the employee league. Lem (Perkins), a scoundrel in the apartment building, recommends a bet that Janie cannot resist, and she uses some of the league dance money to place her wager. Mame's creative ideas have mistakenly been credited to Bill and he is given a chance to be a window dresser at the store. When Mame leaves on vacation, Bill and Janie try window dressing together, with disastrous results: Janie seduces Bill. Meanwhile, Mame returns early to find Bill kissing her sister.

He taught at the University of Kansas from 1960 until 1971 and then at the University of Connecticut until his retirement in 1996, after being diagnosed with Waldenstrom‚Äôs macroglobulinemia. After his death in 2009, a set of papers on army ants were published in Insectes Sociaux in memory of his work. Personal life Rettenmeyer was born in Meriden, Connecticut, to his parents Frederick and Gertrude; he had one sister. He first met his wife Marian at a summer school at the University of New Hampshire in 1951 and married her in 1955. She had been interested in insects from an early age and Rettenmeyer \\"knew she was a woman I had to keep track of\\"; she would become his lifelong assistant. Together they had a son and a daughter. In 1996 he was diagnosed with Waldenstrom‚Äôs macroglobulinemia, a form of lymphoma and expected to die within a few years. Although he retired the same year, a new drug developed soon after his diagnosis kept the disease in check, allowing him to continue to work, despite often having to use a wheelchair due to his frailty. He continued to correspond with other army ant researchers with enthusiasm after retiring. Education Rettenmeyer attended Swarthmore College as an undergraduate, majoring in Biology and graduated in 1953. Whilst in his junior year he was contacted by Theodore Schneirla, an acquaintance of his professor. Schneirla was studying the behaviour of army ants and needed an assistant to work for six months on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama, which Rettenmeyer accepted. Schneirla was interested in army ants behaviour as he thought that by studying it he could understand how it would be possible for humans to fight wars more effectively. They spent many nights observing army ant trails and it was at this time that Rettenmeyer first noticed that other animals lived on the ants. a subject that continued to fascinate him throughout his life. After graduating he studied a PhD in entomology at the University of Kansas under the supervision of Charles Duncan Michener, which he completed in 1962. During his PhD Life magazine approached him asking him to accompany a photographer to BCI to photograph army ants. Rettenmeyer says that this was his \\"lucky break\\" and during nine weeks spent on BCI he collected thousands of specimens, including 147 species of mite found living on the ants. Upon his return to Kansas he was encouraged by faculty members to apply for funding so he could return to study army ants in the rainforest. Through his career he went on over 20 expeditions to Panama, Ecuador and Costa Rica. Research A trail of the army ant Eciton burchellii which Rettenmeyer studied Rettenmeyer studied a broad range of topics related to army ants, publishing on general army ant biology, chemical communication and foraging behaviour. His work also inspired other researchers to investigate such diverse areas as avian ecology, social insect symbioses, tropical phenology and conservation biology. He presented at many conferences and published over 50 papers during his career. In 1963, Rettenmeyer rediscovered the army ant Neivamyrmex sumichrasti, which was first described by Fran√ßois Sumichrast in the 1860s but then not studied further. In 2003, he helped another expedition find the species again, and also tried to find a species of beetle associated with it. However, Ecitosius robustus, the robust army ant beetle, is almost impossible to distinguish physically from the host ant, and Rettenmeyer was unable to find it among the samples collected. He was one of the first biologists to visit Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica, which is now a major center for Neotropical research. In 1975 he reported in Science the first recorded case of mass recruitment in army ants. He found that when worker ants encountered a food source that was too large for them to kill or carry themselves, they can communicate with other workers via chemical and physical signals to recruit them to assist. Working with his wife, Rettenmeyer identified 557 species of animals associated with Eciton burchellii, the greatest number of animals known to associate with any single animal species. Although many of the associations are likely to be opportunistic, over 300 species are thought to be reliant on the ant to survive. As well as these species, Rettenmeyer collected many thousands of specimens that have not been identified. He spent his later years examining samples from 1600 army ant colonies he had collected and in total found 45,000 mites. Of these mites, only 3% have been studied and whilst doing so, three new mite families were identified as well as over 100 new species. Those identified often have inconceivably strange lifestyles. One species (Macrocheles rettenmeyeri) only lives on the feet of one particular species of ant (Eciton dulcius) acting like an extension to the foot, whilst sucking the blood of the ant. This was regarded by E. O. Wilson and Bert H√∂lldobler in Journey to the Ants as the most extraordinary parasitic adaptation among ant parasites. Another mite only lives on the eye of another species and Rettenmeyerius carli lives on the base of worker's mandibles. Scientists are continuing to study the specimens Rettenmeyer collected during his life and one researcher told the BBC that she expected that the number of associated species could potentially double once the work is completed. After his death a set of papers on army ants were published in Insectes Sociaux in memory of his work. In 2016, a grant was awarded to create an online database of the Rettenmeyer's collection of over two million specimens. Photography Rettenmeyer was known for his ability to photograph previously unseen aspects of army ant behaviour and his photographs appeared in National Geographic, the Audubon Encyclopedia of Wildlife, National Wildlife Federation, and Smithsonian magazine. Among his accomplishments was photographing army ants mating for the first time, as well as estimating the longevity of the queen by recapturing a specimen. Overall his photographs appeared in over 100 publications. In 2006 he published a self-produced DVD titled Astonishing Army Ants using footage that he had collected over 35 years. It was reviewed as being extremely information rich and a \\"must-see for ant enthusiasts\\" but so full of facts it is exhausting to watch. In January 2009 he was still working on another DVD titled The World‚Äôs Largest Animal Association documenting the hundreds of animals he found associated with E. burchellii. Teaching From 1960, during the later years of his PhD he began to teach at the University of Kansas, until he moved to the University of Connecticut in 1971. There he taught biology, social insects and photography for biologists. As well as this he was responsible for resurrecting the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History which he was the founding director of. Although the origins of a natural history museum at the University of Connecticut existed as early as 1881, Rettenmeyer was the force behind establishing a proper museum to house the university's specimens which opened in 1985. He continued as the director until his retirement. References External links *Carl W. and Marian E. Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection at the University of Connecticut.

The GEAR campaign urged UN Member States and the UN Secretariat to move swiftly forward to create a new UN gender equality entity. GEAR also urgeds the UN to set up a transparent process now for recruiting the best qualified Under Secretary- General to head this agency. The United Nations must move without further delay to implement changes that it has repeatedly recognized as critical to fulfilling its mandate of working for gender equality as a crucial component of development, human rights, peace, and security. Background In 2006, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan convened a High- Level Panel to explore how the UN system could be strengthened in terms of coherence and coordination in the areas of development, humanitarian affairs and the environment. After women from around the world pressured the UN to better address gender equality in the reform process, Kofi Annan asked the Panel to include gender equality as its mandate. The Panel's report included recommendations on strengthening the gender equality architecture (GEA), and was endorsed by the current Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki- Moon in March 2007. Campaign In March 2007, the Women's Environment & Development Organization (WEDO), together with the Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL) convened a meeting of 50 women activists from around the world, to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted strategy for global, regional and national action to gain the UN General Assembly's approval of a stronger and single, fully resourced women's entity at the UN. As a result of that meeting and the continued need for women's collaborative advocacy on this issue, WEDO and the CWGL, along with hundreds of activists spanning all regions, launched the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign in February 2008, to mobilize women's groups and allies to push for the adoption of the new UN entity for gender equality and women's empowerment. Regional groups such as the African Women's Development and Communication Network were mobilized to support the campaign. On June 14, 2010, Charlotte Bunch, on behalf of the GEAR Campaign, spoke at the UN Millennium Development Goals Informal Interactive Hearings. The audience at these hearings included the UN General Assembly, civil society organizations and the private sector. Bunch spoke about the urgency in establishing the new gender entity and articulated the linkages between gender equality, human rights and the MDGs in an effort to address the gaps on the ground in implementing promises that have been made by governments and the UN. The meeting was convened in order to provide input to the preparatory process for the \\"MDG summit\\" (High-level Plenary Meeting) on September 20‚Äì22, 2010. Results On June 30, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly resolution was agreed to and subsequently formally adopted by the General Assembly on Friday, 2 July, to establish \\"UN Women\\", the new gender equality entity at the UN.

They are currently in the permanent collection of the Mir√≥ Foundation in Barcelona. Description This print series can be considered a forerunner to Mir√≥'s 1941 oil series Constellations. These black and white lithographs depict deformed images of animal and human figures. The pictures were a reaction to the Spanish Civil War, which was being waged at the time they were created. Even prior to the war, Mir√≥ had painted figures which expressed the pain of the forthcoming conflict in his Wild Paintings, such as in Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement. Here he used the printing skills he had been experimenting with since the 1930sBarcelona Series, Mir√≥ Foundation, accessed September 2011 to create a series that can be interpreted as either 50 individual pieces of art or as only one. Mir√≥ includes distorted ogres who are impotent. The ogres could represent Franco and his generals, but are known also to be based on the fictitious dictator, Ubu Roi, who was created by Alfred Jarry in 1898. The printing of these lithographs during the war required 350 sheets of paper. It is thought that the limited availability of paper led to the print run being limited to a total of just seven sets. After the publication of these prints Mir√≥ went to Paris in 1947, again taking a leading place in an exhibition of Surrealist Art, confirming his important position within that movement. Provenance The images were created between 1939 and 1944 by the artist. They were printed at Miralles, a small printer in Barcelona, in 1944, after Mir√≥ returned from his self-imposed exile in France. Only five sets were created of the series, together with two artist's proof sets. Today only the location of two of these series is known. One set is in the Joan Mir√≥ Foundation and a second set is owned by the descendants of Joan Prats. Because of the censorship in Spain under General Franco following the civil war, it was impossible to exhibit these pictures. Mir√≥ at the time was in internal exile in Mallorca.

It is an analogue of the Schwartz space on a real vector space, and is used to define the space of tempered distributions on a semisimple Lie group. Definition The definition of the Schwartz space uses Harish-Chandra's Œû function and his œÉ function. The œÉ function is defined by : \\\\sigma(x)=\\\\X\\\\ for x=k exp X with k in K and X in p for a Cartan decomposition G = K exp p of the Lie group G, where X is a K-invariant Euclidean norm on p, usually chosen to be the Killing form. . The Schwartz space on G consists roughly of the functions all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing compared to Œû. More precisely, if G is connected then the Schwartz space consists of all smooth functions f on G such that : \\\\frac{(1+\\\\sigma)^rDf}{\\\\Xi} is bounded, where D is a product of left- invariant and right-invariant differential operators on G .
