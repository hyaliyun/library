Early life and education Du Bois was born in New York City on October 26, 1903, to Mattie Schreiber Du Bois and Jean Du Bois, immigrants to the U.S. from Switzerland. She spent most of her childhood in New Jersey, where she graduated from high school in Perth Amboy. She spent a year studying library science at the New York Public Library and then attended Barnard College, graduating with a B.A. in history in 1927. She earned an M.A. in history from Columbia University in 1928. Encouraged by an anthropology course taught by Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas at Columbia, Du Bois moved to California to study anthropology with Native American specialists Alfred L. Kroeber and Robert Lowie. She received her Ph.D. in anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1932. Early work In part due to prejudices against women academics, she was initially unable to find a university position. She remained at Berkeley as a teaching fellow and research assistant from 1932 to 1935. She conducted salvage ethnography on several Native American groups of northern California and the Pacific Northwest, including the Wintu Indians of northern California. She published The 1870 Ghost Dance in 1939, a study of a religious movement among Native Americans in the Western U.S. In 1935, Du Bois received a National Research Council Fellowship to undertake clinical training and explore possible collaborations between anthropology and psychiatry. She spent six months at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, now the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, and six months at the New York Psychoanalytic Society. In New York she worked with psychiatrist Abram Kardiner, who became her mentor and collaborator for several projects in cross-cultural diagnosis and the psychoanalytic study of culture. Du Bois also taught at Hunter College in 1936‚Äì1937 while developing a fieldwork project to test their new ideas. Work in Indonesia and OSS From 1937 to 1939, Du Bois lived and conducted research on the island of Alor, part of the Netherlands East Indies, now Indonesia. She collected detailed case studies, life-history interviews, and administered various personality tests (including Rorschach tests), which she interpreted in collaboration with Kardiner and published as The People of Alor: A Social- Psychological Study of an East Indian Island in 1944. One of her major theoretical advances in this work was the concept of \\"modal personality structure\\". With this notion she modified earlier ideas in the Culture and Personality school of anthropology on \\"basic personality structure\\" by demonstrating that, while there is always individual variation within a culture, each culture favors the development of a particular type or types, which will be the most common within that culture.Christina Toren, \\"Culture and Personality\\" in Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology (London: Routledge, 1996) Her work strongly influenced other psychiatric anthropologists, including Robert I. Levy, with his person-centered ethnography, and Melford Spiro. Like many other American social scientists during World War II, Du Bois served as a member of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) working in the Research and Analysis Branch as Chief of the Indonesia section. In 1944 she moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to serve as chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command. For her service to the country in the OSS, Du Bois received the Exceptional Civilian Service Award from the United States Army in 1946. The Thai government honored her with the Order of the Crown of Thailand in 1949 for her efforts during the war on behalf of Thailand. Later work and Harvard career She left the OSS after World War II and from 1945 to 1949 was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research. In 1950, she declined an appointment to succeed Kroeber as head of the anthropology department at Berkeley rather than sign the California Loyalty Oath required of all faculty members. Du Bois worked for the World Health Organization in 1950‚Äì1951. In 1954, she accepted an appointment at Harvard University as the second person to be the Samuel Zemurray Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe Professor at Radcliffe College. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1955. She was the first woman tenured in Harvard's Anthropology Department and the second woman tenured in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. She conducted research between 1961 and 1967 in the temple city of Bhubaneswar in the Indian state of Orissa, where a number of graduate students in Anthropology and Social Relations conducted fieldwork. Du Bois was president of the American Anthropological Association in 1968‚Äì1969 and of the Association for Asian Studies in 1969‚Äì1970, the first woman to be allowed that honor. In 1970 she retired from Harvard but continued teaching as Professor-at-large at Cornell University (1971‚Äì1976) and for one term at the University of California, San Diego (1976). Most of her research materials and personal papers are held in the Tozzer Library at Harvard University. Some are in the Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago. Personal life Du Bois met Jeanne Taylor, another OSS employee, in Ceylon. There she began a lesbian relationship with her. They lived together as a couple and in the mid-1950s they visited Paul and Julia Child in Paris. Du Bois' obituary in The New York Times called Taylor \\"her longtime companion.\\" Du Bois and Taylor, according to her Harvard Library biography, \\"enjoyed an active social life\\" together.

Features It has an extra-low dispersion lens which zooms from 37.5 to 150 mm, and an 11-point autofocus system. The camera is almost entirely automatic, but it does allow spot metering, 6 flash modes and infinity focus. It has an infra red sensor to allow it to be used with a proprietary remote control. It also has a self- timer. The manufacturer claims an all weather design, and this is written on top of the camera, by this they mean it is splashproof. It is still vulnerable to damage from direct sunlight and extremes of temperature (below -10 and above 40 degrees Celsius). It has a sliding lens cover, which acts as an on/off switch. It also blocks the viewfinder when closed, so the viewfinder can only be used when the camera is on and the flash charged, meaning the battery is being drained. It accepts film speeds between ISO 50 and 3200 using DX coding. Non DX-Coded-film is set at ISO 100. It uses one lithium battery size 123A. =Exposure Modes= It has the following Exposure Modes: *Auto Exposure - Automatically sets the correct exposure. *Spot Metering - For use when taking pictures when the subject is in front of a high-contrast environment. *Infinity Focus - The camera sets the working distance at infinity =Special Features= It has the following special features: *Self- Timer - After setting the timer the indicator lights for 10 seconds then flashes for 2. After this the shutter will release. *Camera Shake Indicator - When the green and orange lamps blink, this means that the camera is shaking, and the picture may blur. When the lamps stop blinking the camera is held steady and is ready to take a picture. *Remote Control - Simply press the button on the remote, the indicator starts blinking and the shutter fires after 3 seconds. =Flash Modes= It has the following flash modes: *Auto Flash - low-light, backlight and fluorescent light. *Red-Eye Reduction - This mode uses a series of low power pre-flashes rather than a separate bulb. *Flash Off - This will cause the camera to automatically use a slower shutter speed necessitating the use of a tripod or similar *Fill-in flash - Provides just the right amount of additional light shadow or fluorescent light. *Night Scene Flash - This also uses a slow shutter speed and is incompatible with spot-metering mode *Red-Eye Reduction Night Scene Flash =Flash distances= The manufacturer claims the following flash effective distances: *At ISO 100: **Wide Angle: 0.6 to 4.6 metres (2.0 to 15.1 ft) **Telephoto: 0.8 to 1.8 metres (2.6 to 5.9 ft) *At ISO 200: **Wide Angle: 0.6 to 6.5 metres (2.0 to 21.3 ft) **Telephoto: 0.8 to 2.5 metres (2.6 to 8.2 ft) *At ISO 400: **Wide Angle: 0.6 to 9.2 metres (2.0 to 30.2 ft) **Telephoto: 0.8 to 3.6 metres (2.6 to 11.8 ft) =Date Function= There is also a quartz date model (QD).

Doyel, Tucson & London: The University of Arizona Press The purpose of the foundation was to conduct archaeological research in the American Southwest and surrounding areas. Beginning Harold S. Gladwin was a New York City stockbroker who left his position there and moved to Santa Barbara, California. There he met his future wife Winifred and William North Duane who introduced Gladwin to his cousin, archaeologist A.V. Kidder. Gladwin spent two field seasons with Kidder in northern Arizona. It was at that time when Gladwin's passion and curiosity for the Southwest grew and inspired him to start Gila Pueblo.Emil Walter Haury, May 2, 1904‚ÄîDecember 5, 1992  By Raymond Harris Thompson, Caleb Vance Haynes, Jr., and James Jefferson Reid  Biographical Memoirs Research With the backing and funding of Gladwin Gila Pueblo was able to do excavations and research throughout the Southwest. One of the most important contributions made by people working for Gila Pueblo was defining the Hohokam culture. One of the people involved in this definition was the young Emil Haury. In 1930 Haury became the assistant director of Gila Pueblo. Another accomplishment made by Gila Pueblo was the defining of the Cochise Culture.Sayles, E.B., and Ernst Antevs (1941) The Chochise Culture, Medallian Papers: Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona In 1950, Gila Pueblo shut down and donated its collection to the Arizona State Museum, located on the University of Arizona campus.

It opened as Great Casterton Secondary Modern School in 1939. The catchment area is the eastern part of Rutland including Cottesmore, Empingham and Ketton but the college attracts many of its students from Stamford, across the Lincolnshire boundary. Prior to academy conversion, the school had been rated as ‚Äòoutstanding‚Äô in 2010. In December 2014, Ofsted rated the college as ‚Äòrequires improvement‚Äô in all areas (teaching, behaviour, leadership and achievement). The then principal Victoria Crosher defended the fall in rating as partly due to changes in the \\"C\\" boundary at GCSE. With the withdrawal of the Tresham Institute from providing post-16 education in Rutland, CBEC in 2010 took over responsibility for Rutland College which was renamed Rutland County College. In 2015 it consulted on moving its entire sixth form from Oakham to its Casterton site. However, in March 2017, the college announced that the sixth form would be closing as not enough students showed interest to study there.

Biography Jones entered Cornell University in 1909, majoring in mechanical engineering. He showed little initial promise in track, not making the team until his last year and not impressing until his last race. An extremely popular and handsome man, Jones worked long hours on his studies, played basketball and tennis in the summer and ran as a pastime. As a senior, he was selected for membership in the Quill and Dagger society. But he worked and trained hard as a runner and had the most successful coach of the era, Jack Moakley. Initially a cross country runner, he won the freshman intercollegiate championships easily and in the fall of his second year won the IC4A cross country championship. On May 27, 1911, Jones ran in the IC4A championships at the Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium in Allston, Massachusetts in front of 12,000 spectators. Entered in the mile, Boyle of Penn State led at the quarter in 59 followed by his teammate Wilton Paull. Jones hung back in fifth place. Hanavan of Michigan State led at the half-mile mark with a 2:08, with Paull in second and Jones in third. Paull grabbed the lead at 1,000 yards, but Hanavan regained it for a lap. Then, Jones lengthened his stride and passed Paull and Hanavan, winning by 10 yards. His time: 4:15, a new amateur world record, finally surpassing Thomas Conneff's 4:15 set 16 years earlier. However the time was inferior to the professional record of 4:12 set by Walter George in 1886. Jones was not done for the day. He additionally ran and won the 880 yards to give Cornell the IC4A championship. He spent the summer playing baseball and tennis, won the IC4A cross country championship again in the fall, then tied for first in the mile with a 4:20 at the 1912 IC4A. He won the 880 in a collegiate record time of 1:53. =1912 Olympics= He had no desire to compete in the Olympics, but was talked into it and made the ship shortly before it departed for Stockholm. The 1912 Olympic 1500 metre competition featured the greatest field of mile/1500 m runners ever assembled to that point. Besides Jones, the 1908 Olympic champion Mel Sheppard was entered, as was the speedy Arnold Jackson of Britain, and the promising miler Norman Taber from Providence, Rhode Island. Additionally, American Abel Kiviat, who held the world record in the 1500 m, was in the field. Jones was not as prepared as he could have been as he could not train on the ship across the Atlantic, so Kiviat, who had set his 1500 m record of 3:55 only on 26 May of that year, barely missing Jones' mile record in the process, was favored. In the end, Jackson prevailed in the final, held July 10, with Kiviat and Taber so close an official camera needed to be consulted to determine who won silver. Jones finished fourth. He also participated in the 800 metres event but he was eliminated in the first round. At the same Olympics he competed in the baseball event which was held as demonstration sport. Jones, out of the medals, won his third IC4A cross country championship that fall, then ran an indoor mile in 4:19 early in 1913 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. =Second mile record= On 31 May, Jones ran again in the IC4A championships in Cambridge, and was up against Olympic 1,500 m silver medalist Taber in the mile. Taber led at the first three quarters, in 61.6, 2:09.3 and 3:16.1. But Jones launched into his drive as the bell for the final lap sounded and Taber couldn't respond. He crossed the finish line in 4:14, a new world amateur record, and the first mile record to be recognized by the new governing body of track and field, the IAAF, known then as the International Amateur Athletics Federation. Jones subsequently lost his next race, the 880 yd, and this proved to be his final race. He graduated from college and retired from the sport.

Synaptic gating is the ability of neural circuits to gate inputs by either suppressing or facilitating specific synaptic activity. Selective inhibition of certain synapses has been studied thoroughly (see Gate theory of pain), and recent studies have supported the existence of permissively gated synaptic transmission. In general, synaptic gating involves a mechanism of central control over neuronal output. It includes a sort of gatekeeper neuron, which has the ability to influence transmission of information to selected targets independently of the parts of the synapse upon which it exerts its action (see also neuromodulation). Bistable neurons have the ability to oscillate between a hyperpolarized (down state) and a depolarized (up state) resting membrane potential without firing an action potential. These neurons can thus be referred to as up/down neurons. According to one model, this ability is linked to the presence of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. External stimulation of the NMDA receptors is responsible for moving the neuron from the down state to the up state, while the stimulation of AMPA receptors allows the neuron to reach and surpass the threshold potential. Neurons that have this bistable ability have the potential to be gated because outside gatekeeper neurons can modulate the membrane potential of the gated neuron by selectively shifting them from the up state to the down state. Such mechanisms have been observed in the nucleus accumbens, with gatekeepers originating in the cortex, thalamus and basal ganglia. Gated synapse model Bipolar junction transistor which can be used as a model for synaptic gating. B would represent the gatekeeper neuron that regulates the transmission of the signal from C to E. The model for gated synapses was originally derived from the model electronic circuit, in which the gatekeeper serves as a transistor in a circuit. In a circuit, a transistor can act as a switch that turns an electrical signal on or off. In addition, a transistor can serve to amplify an existing current in a circuit. In effect, the gatekeeper neuron acts as the transistor of a gated synapse by modulating the transmission of the signal between the pre-synaptic and post- synaptic neurons. In a model gated synapse, the gate is either open or closed by default. The gatekeeper neuron, therefore, serves as an external switch to the gate at the synapse of two other neurons. One of these neurons provides the input signal and the other provides the output signal. It is the role of the gatekeeper neuron to regulate the transmission of the input to the output. When activated, the gatekeeper neuron alters the polarity of the presynaptic axon to either open or close the gate. If this neuron depolarizes the presynaptic axon, it allows the signal to be transmitted. Thus, the gate is open. Hyperpolarization of the presynaptic axon closes the gate. Just like in a transistor, the gatekeeper neuron turns the system on or off; it affects the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron. Whether it is turned on or off is dependent on the nature of the input signal (either excitatory or inhibitory) from the presynaptic neuron. Inhibition =Modulation of interneurons= Gating can occur by shunting inhibition in which inhibitory interneurons change the membrane conductance of an excitatory target axon, thereby diffusing its excitatory signal. A gating signal from the gatekeeper triggers these inhibitory interneurons in order to prevent one set of neurons from firing even when stimulated by another set. In this state, the gate is closed. Examples of this kind of gating have been found in visual cortical neurons and areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in primates that may be responsible for suppressing irrelevant stimuli. Studies suggest that this kind of inhibition can be attributed in part to GABA receptor-mediated synapses. In order for these inhibitory interneurons to act upon their targets, they must receive input from a gatekeeper signal that stimulates them. This input can be either intrinsic, extrinsic or both. Extrinsic input comes from an area of the brain anatomically and functionally distinct from a given circuit, while intrinsic input is released from parts if the circuit itself. Generally, this input occurs in the form of neuromodulatory substances, such as hormones, neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters that have been released from incoming neurons. These signals then converge on the gatekeeper, where they are integrated and directed toward the target. Depending on the circuit, gate signals may arrive from different brain areas. For example, studies have shown that the entorhinal cortex may gate areas of the medial PFC, thereby inhibiting them from projecting to other brain areas. Additional research has shown that the thalamus can also act as a source for gating signals. In the pathway between the PFC and the hippocampus, stimulation of mediodorsal thalamic neurons, as well as stimulation of ventral tegmental area neurons inhibited PFC neuron firing. These inhibitory effects were shown to be modulated by various dopamine receptor antagonists, which implies some role of dopamine as a neuromodulatory agent in this circuit. =Role in spatial attention= Due to the brain's limited capacity to process information, it becomes necessary that the brain have the ability filter out unnecessary information, and select important information. Input, especially to the visual field, competes for selective attention. Models for gating mechanisms in the process of attention have been explored by many groups of researchers, however, a consensus on the role of synaptic gating in attention has not been reached. =Role in working memory= Gating mechanisms in the basal ganglia have been linked to our ability to filter irrelevant information and access relevant information from working memory. In this instance, the gatekeeping function is the responsibility of the thalamus. It opens the gate between two areas in the cortex, allowing for the influence of stimuli in working memory. The thalamus, however, is tonically inhibited by the basal ganglia. Activation within the basal ganglia will allow for the disinhibition of the thalamus and thus, the opening of the gate. Permissive gating The firing of an action potential, and consequently the release of neurotransmitters, occurs by this gating mechanism. In synaptic gating, in order for an action potential to occur, there must be more than one input to produce a single output in the neuron being gated. The interaction between these sets of neurons creates a biological AND gate. The neuron being gated is bistable and must be brought to the up state before it can fire an action potential. When this bistable neuron is in the up state, the gate is open. A gatekeeper neuron is responsible for stimulating the bistable neuron by shifting it from a down state to an up state and thus, opening the gate. Once the gate is open, an excitatory neuron can cause the bistable neuron to further depolarize and reach threshold causing and action potential to occur. If the gatekeeper does not shift the bistable neuron from down to up, the excitatory neuron will not be able to fire an action potential in the bistable neuron. Both the gatekeeper neuron and excitatory neuron are necessary to fire an action potential in the bistable neuron, but neither is sufficient to do so alone. An example of this type of gating may occur in the nucleus accumbens. Studies have shown hippocampal neurons may gate the transmission of signals between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Stimulation of the prefrontal cortical neurons has a very small chance of eliciting an action potential in the nucleus accumbens while those neurons are in the down state. Likewise, stimulation of hippocampal neurons fails to produce action potentials in the nucleus accumbens; however, these hippocampal neurons have been shown to switch their targets in the nucleus accumbens to the up state. As long as these neurons remain in the up state, stimulation of prefrontal cortical neurons has a much higher likelihood of producing action potentials in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, the hippocampus serves as the gatekeeper for information flow from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens, such that its action permissively gates these synapses. Synaptic gating involves a variety of mechanisms by which the efficacy of neuronal activity is modulated. Additional studies demonstrate the permissive properties of synaptic gating. In certain instances, membrane depolarization will cause an opening of the gates that previously had an inhibitory effect on the neuron they were gating. This permissive gating is more than a matter of simple summation, however. Summation is the convergence of many EPSPs at the axon hillock (either from a single neuron firing at a high frequency or from many neurons firing at once) that depolarizes the membrane potential to the point of threshold. The membrane depolarization caused by the opening of synaptic gates causes an additional increase in intracellular calcium that facilitates the release of neurotransmitters; thus, it is able to selectively distribute information from the presynaptic cell. Disease =Comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety= Studies of children diagnosed with ADHD have shown considerably higher scores on the Anxious/Depressed scale of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, which implies a comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety. It has been suggested that impaired synaptic gating processes in the nucleus accumbens are the underlying cause of this comorbidity. This defect causes a reduction in synaptic gating of dopamine input from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on the nucleus accumbens. One theory supposes that this defect reduces the individual's ability to selectively inhibit fear responses from the amygdala, leading to anxiety. There are several theories, however, on how this impairment ultimately affects those with ADHD. In studies with rodents, the prefrontal cortex, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the processing of information lasting from milliseconds to several seconds, while the hippocampus has been implicated in the processing of information for longer time scales ‚Äì such as minutes to hours. Damage to both these areas in people with ADHD seems to illustrate why they exhibit inattentiveness and impulsiveness. Nucleus accumbens neurons are bistable and thus can be selectively gated to either an \\"up\\" ‚Äì depolarized state or a \\"down\\" ‚Äì hyperpolarized state. Nucleus accumbens neurons are gated by hippocampal and amygdala input and this creates a depolarized accumbens neuron that is more receptive to innervation from input from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, in patients with ADHD not only is the input from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens reduced but in addition the gating input from the hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens is also reduced leading to a reduction in activation of the nucleus accumbens neurons. Individuals that take medication such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) will increase their dopamine (DA) output along many of these synapses helping to compensate in the loss of synaptic activity generated from the pathophysiology of ADHD. Taking methylphenidate can increase DA projections to the nucleus accumbens, which can not only act to increase synaptic activity between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (improving memory) but also act as a reward system as the nucleus accumbens is part of the mesolimbic pathway. Moreover, it is possibly why individuals on Ritalin have a ‚Äúneed‚Äù and ‚Äúdesire‚Äù to learn as it acts as a positive reinforcer in the brain. In addition, this reward circuitry activation is most likely a reason why methylphenidate is highly addictive and carries great dependence. In conclusion, synaptic gating illustrates a plausible mechanism by which ADHD medication like Ritalin modulates synaptic activity and memory. =Schizophrenia= People who suffer from schizophrenia often exhibit an inability to illustrate context-dependent memory, an inability to show affective valence ‚Äì proper emotions, and an inability for attentional and temporal processes. Synaptic gating seems to illustrate why all of these inabilities develop. In particular, hippocampal input into the nucleus accumbens, a region of the basal ganglia, acts as a gate creating a more depolarized up state within the accumbens neurons allowing them to be more receptive to innervation from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, amygdala input, in much the same way, acts as a gate creating a more depolarized state within the accumbens neurons although this depolarized state is much more transient. All in all, nucleus accumbens neurons are bistable. People with schizophrenia have damage to the hippocampus and amygdala illustrating improper gating and resulting in nucleus accumbens neurons being in the down position. This is why people with schizophrenia display an inability for context-dependent memory and their inability to show proper affective valence. In addition, because accumbens neurons are in the down position they are not as receptive to PFC stimulation and therefore people with schizophrenia show problems with attentional deficits. The gating theory of schizophrenia posits a bistable nucleus accumbens neuron that when gated improperly leads to a wealth of behavioral and memory deficits. Current and future research Current research now has shed light on the fact that the bistability of a neuron may be part of a larger bistable neural network. Evidence of a bistable network has been shown with the interneurons of the auditory cortex. The stable states of this auditory cortex network are either synchronous or antisynchronous, which illustrates its bistable nature. When auditory interneurons were coupled with electrical and chemical inhibitory synapses, a bimodal firing pattern was observed. This bimodal pattern illustrates the bistability of the network to fire at either a synchronous or antisynchronous state. These two states could be modes by which an individual perceives different frequencies in sound waves. Future research is looking into whether this bistable network embodies many of the properties of a bistable neuron, and if there is a larger gatekeeper modulating the network as a whole. It has been shown that nucleus accumbens neurons are capable of being gated because they are bistable. Recent evidence has shown that neurons in the cortex are also bistable, and thus also able to be gated. There appear to be three different types of gating circuits ‚Äì one that is controlled by the cortex, one that is controlled by the association nuclei in the thalamus, and one that is controlled by circuits spanning the basal ganglia, cortex, and the thalamus. Strong evidence has concluded that gating from thalamus impacts the prefrontal cortex response from the hippocampus. This is seen as either an enhancement or a suppression illustrating the bistability of the process. It has been proven that nucleus accumbens neurons act as a gate yet do the neurons in the cortex act in the same manner? Future research will look at similarities between the two sets of bistable neurons. In addition, the mechanism of shifting the bistable neurons to their ‚Äúdown‚Äù state needs to be expanded upon. This state leads to inhibition and thus are their inhibitory interneurons that modulate this shift and if so are inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA involved? Lastly, neurons capable of modulating gates such as hippocampal and thalamic neurons can contact many different areas of the brain. With increasing research saying that neurons in the cortex, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum are all able to be gated, can the hippocampus modulate the signals for all of these and if so can it connect these different brain areas into a much larger neural network capable of being modulated all at once? These are the questions at the heart of synaptic gating in the future.

It is on the southeast edge of the Forest of Compi√®gne, northeast of Paris, between Villers-Cotter√™ts and Compi√®gne. The Ch√¢teau de Pierrefonds includes most of the characteristics of defensive military architecture from the Middle Ages, though it underwent a major restoration in the 19th century. History In the 12th century, a castle was built on this site. Two centuries later, in 1392, King Charles VI turned the County of Valois (of which Pierrefonds was part) into a Duchy and gave it to his brother Louis, Duke of Orl√©ans. From 1393 to his death in 1407, the latter had the castle rebuilt by the court architect, Jean le Noir. View of the ruins before the 19th-century restoration In March 1617, during the early troubled days of Louis XIII's reign, the castle, then the property of Fran√ßois-Annibal d'Estr√©es (brother of the beauty Gabrielle d'Estr√©e), who joined the \\"parti des m√©contents\\" (party of discontent) led by Henri II, Prince of Cond√©, was besieged and taken by troops sent by Richelieu, the secretary of state for war. Its demolition was started, but not carried through to the end because of the enormity of the task. The exterior works were razed, the roofs destroyed and holes made in the towers and curtain walls. The castle remained a ruin for more than two centuries. Napoleon I bought it in 1810 for less than 3,000 francs. During the 19th century, with the rediscovery of the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages, it became a \\"romantic ruin\\": in August 1832, Louis-Philippe gave a banquet there on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Louise to L√©opold de Saxe-Cobourg Gotha, first king of the Belgians. Among other artists, Corot depicted the ruins in several works between 1834 and 1866. The Ch√¢teau de Pierrefonds has been classified as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1848. Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (later Napoleon III of France) visited the castle in 1850. As emperor, he asked Viollet-le-Duc in 1857 to undertake its restoration, which was continued by Maurice Ouadou and then Juste Lisch until 1885. There was no question of a simple repair to the habitable parts (the keep and annexes): the \\"picturesque\\" ruins in front were to be kept for decor. In 1861, the project grew in scale: the sovereign wanted to create an imperial residence, so the castle was to be entirely rebuilt. The works, which would cost 5 million francs, of which 4 million were to come from the civil list, were stopped in 1885, six years after the death of Viollet-le-Duc. The departure of Napol√©on III had halted the reconstruction and, through lack of money, the decoration of rooms was unfinished. Inside, Viollet-le-Duc produced more a work of invention than restoration (polychrome paintings). He imagined how the castle ought to have been, rather than basing his work on the strict history of the building. On the other hand, with the exterior he showed an excellent knowledge of the military architecture of the 14th century. Castle today Ch√¢teau de Pierrefonds has been a monument historique since 1862. It is now managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux. Media The castle has often been used as a location for filming including Les Visiteurs, Le Capitan, Highlander: The Series, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and the 1998 version of The Man in the Iron Mask. The castle was used as the setting for Camelot in the BBC series Merlin; a cut scene of this castle was used to portray Wiz Tech Academy in Disney's TV series, Wizards of Waverly Place. In 2017, the castle was used for filming during the Canal+ and Netflix series Versailles.

The day had a religious importance, as being the St. Elijah's Day (Eastern Orthodox calendar). The Montenegrin Army was led by the two Montenegrin dukes, Ilija Plamenac and Marko Miljanov, who had about 5,000 troop under their direct command. Ottomans had strength of 40,000. Days before the battle, a Montenegrin Muslim, Ma≈°o-Had≈æi Ahmetov revealed Ottoman plans to Marko Miljanov, so that Montenegrins knew where the attack was going to come from. The Ottomans advanced from the Southwest towards Kuƒçi, planning their final attack for 3 August. But, since Montenegrin commanders knew of their plans, they counterattacked a day before. Most of the fighting occurred at the bottom of Heljam hill, where Ottomans were defending from the trenches. While Marko Miljanov was in the front lines, Ilija Plamenac was commanding the Montenegrin army from the back, developing a strategy. After the victory was secured, Montenegrins captured the Ottoman leaders, put them in a house and burned it to the ground. The rest of Montenegrins chased the remaining Ottomans southward, forcing them into a fast retreat. The exact number of Montenegrin casualties is unknown, but it is certain that Ceklin battalion suffered the greatest losses. The most successful part of the Montenegrin Army was Martiniƒái battalion, which killed 2,000 Ottomans, and captured 6 enemy flags. Novak Vujo≈°eviƒá from Kuƒçi tribe was the biggest hero of the battle, killing 28 enemy soldiers; he later received an award from the Russian emperor. After the battle, Montenegrins sent a \\"gift\\" to Mahmud Pasha - a live wolf, as a symbol of Montenegrin pride and freedom. Marko Miljanov, one of the two Montenegrin commanders, was awarded the best captured sword and a house in Medun, which is today a museum. After the battle, Kuƒçi clan was awarded a medal for bravery by King Nicholas I. The importance of this Montenegrin victory was that it stopped the Ottoman advance, and secured Montenegrin victory in the Montenegrin‚ÄìTurkish War of 1876‚Äì1878. Notes  Sources  *William H.

Their funding is provided by private supporters, including individuals, corporations, and other nonprofit foundations. The organization's mission is to \\"Honor Marines by Educating Their Children.\\" Work Since its founding in 1962, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation has provided more than 40,000 scholarships, valued at over $125 million. Their scholarships provide access to affordable education for the children of Marines and Navy Corpsmen attending post-high school, undergraduate, and career technical education programs. The Scholarship Foundation's scholarship reports that: ‚Ä¢ 45% of recipients majors in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and health science majors (compared to 33% nationally) ‚Ä¢ 50% are first-generation college students (compared to 33% nationally) ‚Ä¢ 90% of recipients graduate or are on track to graduate (compared to 53% nationally) In addition, the Scholarship Foundation has been recognized by the Better Business Bureau for satisfying 20 out of 20 standards for charity accountability, transparency, and sound financial management. The Scholarship Foundation's awards are primarily need-based. Qualified applicants must be the child of a Marine or Navy Corpsmen, and their maximum family income must not exceed that of the current pay scale of a sergeant major. The Scholarship Foundation cites the mounting toll of the War on Terror, the rising costs of education, and the maturation of a new generation of Marines as an urgent call for increasing support. Scholarship applications are accepted January 1 - March 1, annually, via the Scholarship Foundation's website: www.mcsf.org Origin The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation began by helping one child. In New York City in 1962, a group of service-minded Marines, led by Brigadier General Martin F. Rockmore, learned that a Marine World War II Medal of Honor recipient could not afford to send his child to college. Concerned, General Rockmore and his peers organized a charity ball that December, which raised $1,500 (1962 dollars); at the Ball, these funds were awarded as a scholarship to a single student. The annual charity ball, known as the New York Leatherneck Ball, continues to this day, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2012. The original event has inspired numerous balls, galas, golf tournaments, and other fundraisers across the country. Today, the Scholarship Foundation, with the assistance of volunteers across the country, hosts more than 35 fundraising activities annually. Special Commitments Through its \\"Heroes Tribute for Children of the Fallen\\" and \\"Heroes Tribute for Children of the Wounded\\" scholarship programs, the Scholarship Foundation has made special commitments to the sons and daughters of Marines and Navy Corpsmen whose parent has been killed or wounded in combat.

Biography He was born in Brooklyn, New York and educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, then at the Columbia University School of Mines. He left without a degree and in 1879 joined his brother, E. B. Castner, as a consulting chemist. He left this business around 1884 and worked to devise a process for manufacturing aluminium by reducing aluminium chloride with sodium. Sodium was relatively expensive at that time and Castner devised a process of producing it by the reduction of caustic soda with carbon, a much cheaper process. He failed to interest American industrialists and travelled to England in 1886. () In 1887 his process helped to lead to the formation of the Aluminium Company in England which produced aluminium of high purity. However, in 1889 it was rendered obsolete by a much cheaper electrochemical process. Castner's only asset then was his cheap sodium and he worked to develop uses for this, including the manufacture of sodium peroxide, a bleaching agent, and sodium cyanide which was used in the gold mining industry. In 1890 Castner devised a new method for producing very pure caustic soda by the electrolysis of brine in a rocking cell containing mercury. This process also produced the useful by-products, chlorine and hydrogen. When Castner came to patent his process he found that a similar patent had been lodged by Karl Kellner in Germany and that this had been made over to the Solvay Company in Belgium. In order to avoid litigation, Castner's Aluminium Company combined with the Solvay Company to form the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company and they built a large works in Runcorn, Cheshire. The Castner- Kellner process is still in operation in Runcorn today. Castner suffered from tuberculosis and died, unmarried, in 1899 in Saranac Lake, Franklin county, New York state.

Master plan Mesa del Sol's master plan called for development over a 40-year span that would cover 9,000 acres of the 12,900-acre site. The remaining 3,200 acres was proposed for parks and open space. The project expected to house 100,000 people, with a downtown area, 37,500 homes, of office space, for residential and supporting retail, for schools including university branches. The master plan also included a new interchange providing access to Interstate 25 that would be financed as part of the development. History Mesa del Sol was approved as part of a public- private partnership strategy with the New Mexico, Albuquerque and University of New Mexico. It has been in planning stages since the 1980s. In 2002, after an open bid process, the New Mexico State Land Office selected Forest City Enterprises as the developer of Mesa del Sol. The project broke ground in 2005 with University Boulevard extended to the community. Forest City Enterprises and Covington Capital Partners were the initial developers. On March 17, 2011, Forest City announced that on March 28 it would break ground on the first phase of its residential development. Forest City plans to build 250 homes and models in the first phase, including infrastructure, and has selected four home builders including Rachel Matthew Homes, RayLee Homes, Paul Allen Homes and Pulte Homes. Builders estimate by early 2012, homes will be available for residents. The homes will range from in size and will cost between $100,000 and $300,000.Master planned development to have homes by 2012 In September 2015, a state audit showed a default judgement against approximately 2,700 acres of the undeveloped community and the land was placed in receivership. In December 2017, with approximately 250 homes having been built, the Mesa Del Sol owners appealed to Albuquerque's Environment Planning Commission for changes to the master plan that might encourage more home building. =Aperture Center= Architect and New Mexico native Antoine Predock designed the Aperture Center building which opened in late 2008 as the centerpiece of Mesa del Sol. It is a LEED-certified environmentally friendly building clad in a glass curtain wall inspired by the shape of bone cells. The $11 million town center building has retail shops and restaurants on the ground floor and offices above. In 2016, the Aperture Center was purchased from Mesa Town Center Building 1 LLC by SC3 International which would relocate its headquarters to the building. At that time, the other tenants were the offices of Mesa Del Sol and the University of New Mexico's New Energy and Industrial Technology and Development Organization (NEDO). In 2018, Guzman Construction Solutions signed a lease for 17,000 square feet of space.  In popular culture  The television show Breaking Bad (filmed in Albuquerque) utilized Mesa del Sol for most of the show's desert shoots and many notable scenes. Albuquerque Studios, located in the Mesa del Sol development, served as headquarters for the Breaking Bad film crew, as well as for the films The Avengers, The Lone Ranger, and The Book of Eli.

Stakeholders  The forces of the Rajput alliance had 12,000 Rathore cavalry, 6,000 Kachwaha cavalry, 7,000 Mughal Cavalry and 30,000 infantry with 129 Pieces of Artillery.Herbert Compton, A particular account of the European military adventurers of Hindustan, page 54 Ambush by the Marathas At dusk, Rajputs and their allies, retired to their respective camps. The Maratha army however held its positions at the mouth of the pass. The real battle however precipitated in the evening by an unforeseen skirmish. Some Maratha Pindaris from the left wing of Maratha lines, managed to seize animals that were a part of Ismail Beg's contingent. This inevitably led to a small skirmish with Ismail Beg's men. General de Boigne then directed his guns on Ismail Beg's contingent.Herbert Compton, A particular account of the European military adventurers of Hindustan, page 60 Caught on unaware, the murderous fire of Maratha guns proved to be deadly. Gopal Bhau and de Boigne, sensing victory, went for the kill. Marathas descended upon enemy camps. Taken aback by the suddenness and the ferocity of the Maratha attack, Rajput resistance capitulated, many were slaughtered in their sleep while others were too intoxicated to fight. The only event worth noting was the Rathor charge on the Maratha right wing. The 4,000 strong Holkar contingent was saved by swift reinforcements sent by Gopal Bhau. The Jaipur Nagas were forced in their positions by the two battalions sent by Boigne. De Boigne after routing the centre and left wing of the alliance, turned all of his forces to the right. The Rathors were soon surrounded and routed, resulting in heavy losses and the death of the Jodhpur general Gangaram. The Gwalior army did not lose any officers apart from two wounded.A History of Jaipur: C. 1503-1938 By Jadunath Sarkar p.294-296 The victory at Patan destroyed the armies of the two most powerful Rajput kingdoms of India and forced them to pay heavy tributes to the Scindias. Ismail Beg's army was also reduced to a few hundred men and was forced to flee. This victory also showed the whole subcontinent that Maratha power had not faded after Panipat and helped consolidate Maratha rule in northern India. The aftermath Pitted against European armed and French trained Marathas, Rajput states capitulated one after the other. Marathas managed to conquer Ajmer and Malwa from Rajputs. Although Jaipur and Jodhpur remained unconquered. Battle of Patan, effectively ended Rajput hopes for independence from external interference. Sir Jadunath Sarkar notes: > From the day of Patan (20th June 1790) to the 2nd of April 1818 when Jaipur > entered into protective subsidiary alliance with the British government, lay > the gloomiest period in the history of Jaipur kingdom. His victory increased Scindia's influence with the Peshwas (Maratha Prime Ministers) in Pune, the seat of Maratha government and firmly established Maratha influence in Rajputana.

Miljus was most likely the first American Serb to play in professional baseball. Early life Miljus was born in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh. He attended Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh. While in school, he worked in the steel mills and played college football and baseball. He also played on local semi-pro teams, which occasionally faced Negro league teams like the Homestead Grays. He graduated as a doctor of dentistry but never practiced. Miljus served in the United States Army during World War I, in France, as part of the 320th Infantry. His wartime bunkmate was Joe Harris. The two of them would later be reunited as members of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Miljus was wounded in action at the Battle of the Argonne and was to be sent home. Instead he chose to rejoin his unit and return to action after leaving the hospital. Career After toiling in the minors, this lanky 178 pounder spent six seasons in the major leagues as a pitcher. Miljus reached the majors in 1915 with the Pittsburgh Rebels of the outlaw Federal League, spending one year with them before moving to the Brooklyn Robins (NL, 1920‚Äì21), Pittsburgh Pirates (NL, 1927‚Äì28) and Cleveland Indians (AL, 1929). More than a dependable pitcher, he filled several roles coming out from the bullpen as a closer or a middle reliever, and as an occasional starter as well. Miljus is probably best remembered as the pitcher who served up a ninth-inning wild pitch that escaped Pirates' catcher Johnny Gooch and allowed the New York Yankees to sweep the 1927 World Series. In Game Four, after striking out Lou Gehrig and Bob Meusel, and with two strikes on Tony Lazzeri, the next Miljus pitch rolled far enough away for Earle Combs to score the winning run. In a seven-season career, Miljus posted a 29‚Äì26 record with 166 strikeouts and a 3.92 ERA in 457‚Öì innings pitched, including 45 starts, 15 complete games, two shutouts, and five saves. As of , Miljus has one of the lowest ERA (3.92) of any major league pitcher coming out of University of Pittsburgh with more than 100 innings, behind Bob Malloy (3.26), Doc Medich (3.77) and Steve Swetonic (3.81).

It was produced and distributed by Warner Bros.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1931-40 by The American Film Institute, c.1993 The film is currently available on DVD in the Forbidden Hollywood series. Plot Vincent Day (Warren William) is a prosecutor who is on the fast track to success. When a man he zealously prosecuted all the way to the electric chair is found to have been innocent, he becomes distressed and quits his job. At the suggestion of a friendly bartender (Guy Kibbee), he decides to switch teams and become a defense attorney specializing in the representation of gangsters and other unsavory people. He will use any tactic to get his clients acquitted, up to and including drinking a slow-acting poison from a bottle of evidence to prove that the substance isn't lethal. The jury acquits the man not knowing that immediately after, Day rushes into a mob doctor's office for a pre-arranged stomach pump. Celia Farraday (Sidney Fox) is a young secretary recently arrived in the city from a small town in Kentucky. When Day makes play for her, she spurns his advances, loyal to her fianc√©, Johnny (William Janney). When the fianc√© is framed for a crime committed by one of Day's clients, Day's affection for Celia not only prompts Day to defend Johnny by implicating his client in the crime, but to reconsider his life of getting criminals out of jail sentences. However, his associates send him a message that his departure will not be allowed. He lets them know that he has all of their secrets in a safe-deposit box, along with instructions for the bank to forward the contents to the District Attorney in the event of his unnatural death. They call his bluff and he is shot while leaving his office to attend Celia's wedding. On the way to the hospital, he tells his faithful secretary that the criminals were wrong to call his bluff and that the information will be on the way to the DA. The movie leaves it ambiguous whether Day, shot several times, will survive his wounds.

Possibly the single most influential work of 17th century French literature, L'Astr√©e has been called the \\"novel of novels\\", partly for its immense length (six parts, forty stories, sixty books in 5399 pages) but also for the success it had throughout Europe: it was translated into a great number of languages and read at every royal court. Even today, this novel is regularly republished, both in full and in abridged edition, and even in comic book form. The first three parts were published in 1607, 1610 and 1619; after Honor√© d'Urf√©'s death in 1625 the fourth was completed by Balthazar Baro, and a fifth and sixth were supplied in 1626 by Pierre Boitel, sieur de Gaubertin.The attribution to \\"Borstet\\" is a frequent mistake caused by a misprint in Lenglet Du Fresnoy's De l'usage des romans (1735). The last two are often counted as one. The plot is immensely complex, but the main thread of the storyline is the perfect love between a shepherd and shepherdess of fifth-century Forez, the heroine Astr√©e (named after Astr√¶a) and her lover C√©ladon (who gave his name to the ceramic). The perfidies and political ambitions of the other characters, which result in many misadventures for the couple, occupy the greater proportion of the novel, which is frequently interrupted by digressions into stories that are strictly unrelated but which serve to flesh out the world in which they live. D'Urf√©'s descriptions of Forez are sufficiently detailed for many locations to be identified without ambiguity. Visitors to Bo√´n can today follow the chemins de l'Astr√©e (\\"paths of Astr√©e\\") by visiting the Grand Pr√© in the grounds of d'Urf√©'s old estate. The most important editions are those of 1733, 1925 and 2006. A film version, Les Amours d'Astr√©e et de C√©ladon, by √âric Rohmer, was made in 2007. An opera by G√©rard Pesson was performed in 2006 at the Stuttgart Opera, and in 2009 in Paris. In his work The social destiny of man: or, Theory of the four movements, Charles Fourier discussed celadony (l'amour C√©ladonique), describing it as purely spiritual love embodied by C√©ladon in L'Astr√©e.Beecher, Jonathan (1990).

Until 1938, the Manchester Fire Brigade had been part of the Manchester City Police and its members attested as police constables, a common practice in the early 20th century. In 1938 it became an independent organisation, but firemen who had joined before that time continued to be police constables and answerable to the Chief Constable in disciplinary matters. The Chief Constable also continued officially to be the Director of the Fire Brigade. The Barnsley-born Greenfield was an experienced First Class Fireman who had been a member of the brigade for some years and was therefore an attested police constable. As such, he was not permitted to join the FBU or any other trade union. However, he took an interest in the welfare of his fellow firemen and particularly of the wartime members of the Auxiliary Fire Service, whose conditions were often extremely poor. He was one of the four members of the board of representatives, the body which had replaced the Police Federation in the fire brigade after 1938. He urged the AFS members to join the FBU, which, not being police officers, they were entitled to do. On 5 November 1940, Greenfield wrote to John Horner, General Secretary of the FBU, informing him of these conditions and enclosing 28 membership application forms from members of the AFS. However, Horner had recently moved and the letter was returned to sender on 9 November. Greenfield had listed his return address as \\"Fire Station, Manchester 10\\", his own station, but the letter was returned simply to \\"The Fire Station, Manchester\\" and delivered to headquarters. On 19 November 1940, Greenfield was summoned before John Maxwell, the Chief Constable of Manchester, and charged with three disciplinary offences: acting in a manner likely to bring discredit upon the force; unauthorised communication with a person not connected with the fire brigade; and divulging to that person fire brigade matters. Maxwell listened to his explanation of his conduct, and then dismissed him on the spot. Greenfield appealed, as was his right, to the Watch Committee, the police force's governing body. However, after making his appeal he was asked to leave the room while they deliberated; Maxwell was allowed to stay while the committee deliberated an appeal against his own decision. Unsurprisingly, the appeal was dismissed. The FBU demanded the return of the letter and membership forms, but Maxwell refused. In response, the FBU took him to court, demanding the return of their property and damages for its wrongful detention. The case, described as \\"unique in legal history\\",\\"Chief Constable to Return Documents: Successful Action by Trade Union\\", The Times, 27 February 1941 was heard in Manchester County Court on 26 February 1941 before Judge Thomas Bowes Leigh. Donald McIntyre appeared for the union and D. P. Dingle, Deputy Town Clerk of Manchester, for the Chief Constable. Dingle made much of the fact that Greenfield had headed his letter \\"Dear Comrade\\", implying that this showed communist sympathies. The judge found in favour of the FBU. He ordered that the letter and forms be returned immediately and that the Chief Constable pay ¬£5 damages for their detention. He also awarded costs against the Chief Constable on the highest possible scale. Greenfield was invited to speak at the annual conference of the FBU in London later that year and was greeted with massive applause. After being dismissed he had obtained a position (and a promotion) as Fourth Officer with Barnsley Borough Fire Brigade. As this was a civilian brigade, he was entitled to join the FBU, and was later elected to the Executive Council. The Greenfield case strengthened the rights to join a trade union and was one of the final nails in the coffin of the system of police-controlled fire brigades.

It is encoded by the LEMD3 gene and was first identified after it was isolated from the serum of a patient with a collagen vascular disease. Structure The protein is 82.3 kDa and has a 40 amino acid long LEM domain located at its amino-terminal region. In its carboxyl end it has a RNA recognition motif (RRM). The LEM domain is also common to two other integral proteins of the INM: lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) and emerin. The LEM segment enables LEMD3 to attach to the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), and therefore, indirectly interact with the chromatin. LEMD3 also has several implications in regulating the cytokine family such as the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) and bone morphogenic protein (BMPs). The RRM domain in its carboxylic region attaches to the SMAD (protein) proteins, which is involved in mediating TGF-Œ≤ cellular signalling. Consequently, LEMD3 indirectly regulates downstream genes. LEMD3 seems to play an important role in regulating the expression of several fundamental genes. LEMD3 and disease LEMD3 has been associated with laminopathies as well as osteopoikilosis. Mutations in the LEMD3 gene have been linked to several genetic diseases such as osteopoikilosis, melorheostosis and Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome.

Epifanio Gonz√°lez Villamil is played by Puerto Rican comedian, special education teacher, choreographer and dancer V√≠ctor Alicea, while Jesusa (Susa) Cruz Avil√©s is played by Puerto Rican singer and comedian Carmen Nydia Vel√°zquez. Susa y Epifanio have hosted the radio program Prende El Fog√≥n on WSKN-AM in San Juan, and the weekday television program El Fog√≥n TV on WORO-TV in Carolina. They also make frequent personal appearances all through Puerto Rico. The duo made a cameo appearance in the 2005 feature film El Sue√±o del Regreso. Epifanio Gonz√°lez Villamil =Fictional background= Don Epifanio was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico sometime near 1945, and claims to having been raised in an upper class subsection of town called \\"La Rambla\\" (named after La Rambla in Barcelona, Spain, a city after which many of Ponce's features and landmarks have been modeled). In reality, according to their one-time producer, Luisito Vigoreaux, Don Epifanio was born on the coastal sub-section of La Guancha, which is a working-class neighborhood. Since ponce√±os (the inhabitants of Ponce) have a reputation for being very fond of their hometown at best -and have a rather snobbyish attitude about it at their worst, in a way that reminds people of the civic pride of Texans with long-term genealogical ties to the state (Ponce is named after Juan Ponce de Le√≥n's family) have about it-, Don Epifanio considers Ponce to be heaven on Earth, and is a constant promoter of the phrase: \\"Ponce es Ponce y lo dem√°s es parking\\" (\\"Ponce is Ponce, and the rest ‚Äìof Puerto Rico- is parking). However, he has since reluctantly moved to Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he lives. Epifanio is a merchant, usually owning kiosks, small eateries or clubs. Due to his age, Epifanio's hair is grey, although reportedly because of a toup√©e he wears to conceal his baldness. Most often he wears a red guayabera shirt with long sleeves. More character traits are explained later in the article. =Character's origin= V√≠ctor Alicea has repeatedly stated that he mainly modeled Epifanio Gonz√°lez Villamil after his own father, with added characteristics from daily observations of real people. The character was born within El Derecho de Lavar, a comedy spoof on a particular radio (later television) telenovela, El derecho de nacer, whose basic format has been followed as a formula for almost 70 years in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other Latin American media. The \\"Taller de Actores Puertorrique√±os\\" (Puerto Rican Actors' Workshop), of which Alicea was a member, set up an entire story behind the parody, as to make it resemble the original but exaggerating its main story line as to make it absurd enough to have a comedy made out it. At the initial stages of the character, Don Epifanio had a laundromat, something that was unbecoming of his avowed origins. His sister was also his partner in the laundry's administrative duties, and constantly had to bring Epifanio to his senses, since his rather caustic sense of humor and constant anger tended to rub the laundry's patrons off. Epifanio had never married and his sister was divorced (she shared a bit of his misanthropy and had a hard time having and keeping a partner). Therefore, when they once found a baby girl inside a trash can in front of their laundromat, they raised her as their \\"niece\\". The girl, Chachita, turned to be a pretty, short, shrill-voiced teenager, who befriended Papo Tennis, a tall, unemployed young man who wore basketball garb and constantly went to the Laundromat to clean his tennis shoes using the laundry's equipment. Epifanio hated Papo for many reasons: his tennis shoes would break the equipment up and Epifanio would use this as an excuse, but the real reason was their perceived social class differences. Epifanio, whose skin isn't \\"fair\\" by any means, would be openly racist towards Afro-Puerto Rican Papo. He would attempt to sabotage any of Chachita's efforts to go out with Papo, and for this he would put his considerable talent as a miser to good use. Most of these attempts would inevitably backfire (or would somehow hint Chachita of her lineage, something that, according to the story, would have to remain a secret forever given the circumstances of Chachita's adoption), and hence, would make the plot of the story each day, since \\"El Derecho de Lavar\\" was a daily 20-minute section within a daily variety show (then aired on WLUZ-TV, San Juan's former Channel 7) The format proved to be too rigid to sustain over time, so some of the logic behind the novela spoof was relaxed in a newer inception, \\"Epifanio's Laundromat\\", which was more centered on Epifanio himself. His attempts to attract clientele and sustain the laundromat would almost always have disastrous results. The owner of WLUZ-TV, Tommy Mu√±iz, grew tired of the constant struggles he faced to sustain his television channel, and as a result, sold the station to foreign owners, who changed the station's format drastically. As a result, much of the station's talent (including Alicea) were forced to migrate elsewhere. Alicea then joined Luisito Vigoreaux's production company, and for close to twelve years starred in Vigoreaux's best-rated television comedies. One of these paired him with Vel√°zquez, starting a partnership that has remained strong ever since. =El Viejo Da√±a'o= On the character's newer plot lines, Epifanio was still a misanthrope and was less racist than before, but would also turn out to be a geriatric sex addict, who would constantly attend the nearby \\"El Pocito Dulce A-Go-Go Girl Bar\\", and hence would almost always be broke after spending his money in lap dances or the dancers themselves. Most often than not he would befriend \\"La Canita\\", a dumb blonde stereotype character played by Puerto Rican comedian Waleska Seda, who would live off Epifanio and get him into financial trouble. This penchant for promiscuity earned Epifanio the moniker \\"El Viejo Da√±a'o\\" (from \\"da√±ado\\", which literally translates to \\"The Damaged Old Man\\"). The epithet \\"viejo da√±a'o\\" has since become a common synonym in Puerto Rico for \\"viejo verde\\", the Spanish phrase used to depict \\"dirty ol' men\\". Given more physical space to act (since the WLUZ-TV's studios were rather small) Alicea then incorporated physical comedy elements to the character, some of which can be directly attributed to Groucho Marx and Charlie Chaplin, were somehow lost in the translation to Spanish of these comedians' work, and were therefore innovative in Puerto Rican comedy. Epifanio would also throw things on purpose and deliberately missing the target, a technique used by Cuban-born comedic actor Leopoldo Fernandez, Jr., who was very popular in Puerto Rico at the time. =¬°¬°Cat√≥lico y Popularrrrrrr!!= Epifanio would also acknowledge a stronger affiliation to the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD in Spanish), to the point of becoming an unofficial symbol for the party. The character has acted as comic relief on party rallies and fundraisers, and constantly dresses in red, the party's color. Alicea, who is actually a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, again used his father as a basis for this. He builds upon the traditional loyalty of older members of the PPD to Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, which borders in the near-religious. As a result of these cultural nuances, Epifanio would describe himself as \\"¬°¬°Cat√≥lico y Popularrrrrrr!!\\" (Roman Catholic and PPD member), trilling the last \\"r\\" for emphasis (as the character often does). When reminded that Roman Catholics aren't supposed to be as sexually \\"damaged\\" as he is, he either changes the subject rather obviously (very rarely) or claims that there is no reason for his proclivities to impede on his affiliations. Already militantly partial to both the PPD and his hometown of Ponce, when the mayor of Ponce, Rafael Cordero Santiago, became a strong leader of the PPD, Epifanio incorporated more references to Ponce and its mayor in his lines. He had to slightly minimize these after Cordero's untimely death from a stroke. =Popular y soberanista= After years of ambiguously identifying with the PPD as a movement instead of a political ideology, Epifanio's character sided with the soberanista faction, which in the past had included prominent Ponce Mayor, Rafael \\"Churumba\\" Cordero. This wing is considered the party's most liberal one, pursuing to promote Puerto Rico beyond territory status by replacing the current territorial clause with a pact based on the sovereignty of both Puerto Rico and the United States, while conserving some current aspects including citizenship, coin and defense. This posture was revealed while he worked as Epifanio in a play titled ¬°Coge Cambio! from 2009 to 2011, and was made official with a \\"welcome card\\" issued by prominent soberanistas Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, Luis Vega Ramos and Carlos \\"Charlie\\" Hern√°ndez. While performing in character, Alicea became more vocal to this belief following February 2010, when an ailing William Miranda Mar√≠n, one of the most outspoken soberanistas in the history of the PPD, pronounced a speech urging all Puerto Ricans to look beyond personal interests to find the convergence needed to push Puerto Rico into the future. From this point onwards, Epifanio's posture remained clear and unchanged, even after the ¬°Coge Cambio! tour had concluded. Susa Cruz In the 1990s, Epifanio was paired with Susa Cruz, setting up a comedic duo that would greatly rely on the acknowledged sexual and political tension between the two. Jesusa Cruz Avil√©s was born in Las Mar√≠as, Puerto Rico. Nicknamed \\"Susa\\", she jokingly claims to be a distant relative of Tom Cruise, whose last name is a homophone of \\"Cruz\\" (and who has no relation with Puerto Rico at all). She is well known for being the best \\"fritolera\\" (fritter cook) in Puerto Rico, having a reputation for having invented the \\"alcapurrias bisexuales\\" (bisexual alcapurrias), named as such by Epifanio due to their ambiguous shape. As many cooks in rural Puerto Rican eateries do, Susa constantly wears a hair mesh. Susa is known for being good natured, naive at times, not too-well educated (words with more than three syllables give her trouble), for speaking atrocious English, and yet for being a New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (PNP, in Spanish) supporter (as many pro-statehood Puerto Ricans are). She is single by choice, since her standard in men have to resemble either Cruise or PNP leader Pedro Rossell√≥, something that is rather difficult to find in Puerto Rico. She is also a good \\"j√≠baro\\" singer (which gives away on Vel√°zquez's own talents as a singer), and is considerably more street-smart than Epifanio. Her trademark phrase is \\"¬°Fuera, catarro!\\" (\\"Cold bug, go away!\\"), usually said as a wish for something unpleasant to go away (and particularly, referring to Epifanio). Character portrayal =Mutual relationship= Susa somehow manages to continue a business relationship with Epifanio, who has always been abusive towards her. At the beginning, he was blatantly racist against Susa (due to her darker skin color), and called her a \\"monita\\" (monkey). Audience protests and complaints from Afro-Puerto Rican community leaders have only diminished Epifanio's rants, and he blames her troubles on her being \\"prieta, bruta y penep√©\\" (black, dumb and PNP member). Susa almost always counters this by hitting Epifanio with her by-now legendary handbag when insulted, something that inevitably causes Epifanio considerable physical pain. Later on, Epifanio became an occasional sexual harasser of Susa's, parodying Puerto Rican relatively lax community standards on the practice. Her mild (and sometimes supportive) reaction towards this somehow hinted that she had at least a passing physical attraction towards Epifanio. Epifanio would constantly make passes at her, asking her to join him at \\"las latas\\" (\\"the cans\\", or warehouse space, at the back of his establishments), and pinching her, to the battle cry of \\"¬°Te pic√≥ el juey!\\" (\\"The crab just pinched you!\\"). She would then either verbally humiliate him in front of other people as retaliation, or would physically assault him to keep him at bay. At times, though, sparks would fly between the two, something which they would deny when asked about it. Somehow this blatantly antagonistic relationship would be sustained without either deteriorating further (or being consummated sexually, on the other hand) over their mutual programs' seasons. Susa would actually attempt to bring some sense into Epifanio's financial and personal life, with very little success. Epifanio would then claim he needed Susa, at least as a verbal target. Puerto Rican disc-jockey and television presenter Antonio S√°nchez, \\"El Gangster\\", would make constant reference to a fabled (some say infamous) motel in Caguas, Puerto Rico, \\"La Hamaca\\" (\\"The Hammock\\") in his radio and television programs. Some television comedy characters in Puerto Rico would make occasional references to La Hamaca, and as a consequence of this, a vaudeville comedy play, called \\"Amor en La Hamaca\\" was written and produced (by Vigoreaux and his partners) to capitalize on the reference. The first installment of the play was successful, and a second run, having little to do with the first play, was written with Susa and Epifanio in mind. This would make good use of Vel√°zquez's singing and Alicea's dancing skills (he was a choreographer for Iris Chac√≥n once). In it, Susa and Epifanio would at last consummate their physical relationship, not without some absurd situations thrown in for comedy. \\"Amor en La Hamaca II\\" would become the longest-running play in Puerto Rican history, playing over 4 consecutive years. After their \\"night at the latas\\", Susa and Epifanio would hint on having had additional nights together, but would tend to be discreet about it (or at least Susa was; Epifanio would give away details to her sheer horror). While acting as Epifanio, Alicea has become a constant promoter of Puerto Rican artists and acts, covering the full spectre of the Puerto Rican humanities' scene. He now voices his political opinions openly and vehemently, championing animal rights, drama and music classes on Puerto Rican public schools, gay and lesbian rights, better living conditions for the elderly, the HIV positive and children, and other liberal causes. This has somehow rehabilitated Epifanio's image among Puerto Ricans, dismissing his \\"viejo da√±a'o\\" antics in favor of a more tolerant, less grumpy image. He still uses risqu√© humor to refer to women he physically likes, which he calls \\"potrancas\\" (young mares), and make the occasional pass to Susa. Radio and television program runs Susa and Epifanio would star in various inceptions of their show on Puerto Rican television: \\"Susa y Epifanio\\", \\"La Taberna Budweiser\\", \\"El Kiosco Budweiser\\" and \\"Caf√© Teatro El Fog√≥n\\", over various Puerto Rican television stations. They would also be featured constantly in Puerto Rican patron saint feasts, honoring the founding of each of the island nation's municipalities. On their live shows they would sing parodies of Puerto Rican song standards ridiculing each other, and would make fun of each other, particularly over that fateful night at \\"La Hamaca\\". They have also recorded a Christmas record together. Vel√°zquez tried her hand at entrepreneurship, and opened a night club in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico; she would try to cater to every segment of the local market: from family comedy afternoons on Sundays to male stripper shows on Tuesdays. Susa Cruz would sometimes guest on some of the shows. The night club was forced to close after four months due to licensing restrictions (and some controversy from the club's neighbors). When most Puerto Rican television stations opted to reduce local programming in favor of syndicated shows produced elsewhere, Alicea and Vel√°zquez started a radio program, \\"Prende El Fog√≥n\\", on WSKN-AM (later moved to WIAC-AM). On this program they would comment the news (Susa would sometimes sing a d√©cima commenting a particular item), and open the phone lines. Susa and Epifanio would ridicule each other's political views, but more often they would ridicule the Puerto Rican political scene, something they claim would fit right into Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's fictional town of Macondo in his book One Hundred Years of Solitude. The program has proven to be an audience favorite. It also opened a community service vehicle for Alicea and Vel√°zquez, and particularly for Alicea. Susa and Epifanio have also taken their \\"Fog√≥n\\" format into television. On their current television program, \\"El Fog√≥n TV\\", they attempt to interview political figures using humor to disarm them. Puerto Rican governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° was their first guest. Susa and Epifanio have also recorded various radio and television advertisements, particularly for products and services catering to the aged, including supplementary health plans and audiology services.

James Fentress) is a 1993 book by Umberto Eco about attempts to devise an ideal language. The writing is essayistic and uses the myth of Babel as a paradigm for connecting linguistic and social practices. Emphasizing that the quest for a perfect language has never been devoid of ideological motivation, Eco outlines some objections to the idea and suggests that an International Auxiliary Language, such as Esperanto, is a more realistic project. He points out that the impossible quest has had some useful side effects (taxonomy, scientific notations etc.) but dwells mostly on exotic proposals. Lengthy passages are devoted to Dante, Lull, Kircher, various 17th century authors and a few less well-known names from later times. The contemporary project for a politically and culturally unified Europe provides the perspective for a more serious consideration of the theme.

Laying down portable tracks, the bandits take the train off the main line, hide it in an abandoned mine shaft, steal the gold, and eradicate their makeshift tracks, leaving a mystery in their wake. Part owner of the mine, Potter Hood, and the railroad president, Horace Moore, search for the mysteriously disappeared train and gold. They are unaware, however, that the criminals are working secretly for Sam Slater, the other partner in the gold mine, who wants to sabotage mine operations enough that he can take over completely. Potter's son, Tom Hood, arrives home from college and determines to solve the mystery with the aid of his pal Bob Collins. They board the gold-shipment special train on its next run.

The story is based on a 1938 novel by Cecil Day-Lewis, writing as Nicholas Blake, The Beast Must Die. A widower, obsessed with revenge after his only son is killed in a hit-and-run incident, tracks down and seduces the driver's mistress who was in the car at the time but his efforts to kill the driver misfire. The film had a total of 1,092,910 admissions in France. Plot A sports car races through the countryside. A young woman is in the passenger seat. It enters a small village at high speed. It hits Charles Th√©nier's nine-year-old son, who is returning from the beach, and drives on without stopping. Charles vows to have his revenge, keeping a journal of his thoughts. The police investigation is fruitless. Charles thinks the guilty party may run a garage, since there is no record of a car going in for repairs. By chance, while pursuing this hunch, he discovers that the actress H√©l√®ne Lanson was the passenger in a car that was damaged on the day of his son's death. Adopting a pseudonym, he seduces her and discovers that the driver was her brother-in-law Paul Decourt. He arranges a trip with H√©l√®ne to visit her sister's family in Brittany. Charles discovers that Paul is detestable, cruel to his wife and hated by his teenage son Philippe. He has conflicting thoughts as to whether or not he will kill Paul. He rescues him from a cliff-fall. Philippe confides to Charles his own desire to kill his father. H√©l√®ne confesses that she once slept with Paul. Charles presses her to explain more of her anxiety about Paul, but she refuses to add anything. Charles decides to kill Paul in a staged sailing accident and buys a boat for that purpose. However, while at sea, Paul pulls a gun on him and reveals that he has read Charles' journal and passed it to his solicitor to take to the police should something happen to him. After returning to the harbor, Paul throws Charles out of his house. Charles appears to abandon his plan to murder Paul and drives away with H√©l√®ne. In a roadside restaurant, a television announcer reports Paul's death from poisoning and appeals for Charles and H√©l√®ne to return, which they do. Charles argues to the police that it would be foolhardy for him to kill Paul when he knew the journal would reach them. They contend that Charles has planned to use this argument to deflect their suspicions, and arrest him. However, Philippe enters and confesses to the murder. Back at their hotel, Charles is weary and promises to tell H√©l√®ne the entire story the next day. She wakes to find his note explaining that Philippe has confessed falsely to the crime Charles himself committed. He tells her to share his confession with the police and that he will punish himself and never be seen again. He is seen sailing oceanward.

In 1423, some namesake streets existed, but in different boroughs. There were two or three High Streets, Carpenters' Street, Butchers' Street, Shoemakers' Street and some more. The reason for that lies in the fact that streets were named after the shops and businesses operating in them. San Nicol√°s was home to the oldest streets, since Navarrer√≠a had been totally destroyed during the War of the Boroughs (1276), and San Cernin did not go unscathed either, with many buildings, streets and churches ruined.

Next to it there was a shepherds' settlement. When the Ottoman army arrived in these areas from Lefkara, during 1570, it attacked the settlement with cannons, which the Ottomans were trying out for the first time. They started firing against the houses with stone shells and the settlement was destroyed along with the church. The inhabitants that survived took refuge in Lympia village. The day that \\"Agia Marina\\" was destroyed was a Tuesday and ever since then the region was named \\"Kakotriti\\" (Bad Tuesday). The church of Saint Marina was rebuilt, while signs of caves can still be found in the area of the settlement. 2007 Recycling Plant Conflicts In 2007, citizens of the village reacted to government plans to build a Recycling Plant (referred to as 'Chita - XYTA') in a neighbourhood called 'Coshi'.

Prelude By the mid of June 1947 the Nationalists had given up any attempt to reinforce Northeast China by sending the 43rd Division of the 94th Army. Instead, the 43rd Division was deployed to the south of Tianjin along with other Nationalist units, including the 16th Army, the Reorganized 62nd Division and the 142nd Division of the 92nd Army. In the region north of Baoding, the Nationalists had six divisions and two regiments, including the Independent 95th Brigade, the 2nd Security Division and the 3rd Security Division stationed at Baoding. For the region along the railway from Gaobei Hotel (Gao Bei Dian, È´òÁ¢ëÂ∫ó) to Xushui (ÂæêÊ∞¥) and the regions of Yi (Êòì) county and Laishui (Ê∂ûÊ∞¥), the garrisons were from the 5th Division and 121st Division of the 94th Army, the 7th Security Division and a regiment of the 109th Division of the 16th Army. The Communists decided to launch an offensive against the Nationalists in the region north of Baoding in accordance with the Communist Summer Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle: *The 16th Army stationed at Baoding *The 94th Army **The 5th Division **The 43rd Division **The 121st Division *The Independent 95th Brigade *The 2nd Security Division *The 3rd Security Division *The 7th Security Division *Local Security Regiments Communist order of battle: *The 2nd Column *The 3rd Column *The 4th Column Campaign On June 25 the Communist 2nd Column attacked the town of Xushui (ÂæêÊ∞¥), and the bulk of the Communist force of the 3rd Column attacked the town of Solid City (Gu Cheng, Âõ∫Âüé) and Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, ÂåóÊ≤≥Â∫ó), while the majority of the Communist 4th Column attacked the region of the Source of the Cao River (Cao He Tou, ÊºïÊ≤≥Â§¥) and the region of Xu River Bridge (Xu He Qiao, ÂæêÊ≤≥Ê°•). Meanwhile, detachments from the Communist 3rd and 4th Columns were deployed to stop any Nationalist reinforcements. By the evening of June 26 the Communist 2nd Column succeeded in taking Xushui (ÂæêÊ∞¥) and completely annihilated the local garrison consisted of a regiment of the 109th Division of the 16th Army. In addition, Nationalist strongholds along the railway from Xushui (ÂæêÊ∞¥) to Tian's Village Shop (Tian Cun Pu, Áî∞ÊùëÈì∫) had fallen into enemy hands. On June 27 the Communist 4th Column succeeded in taking regions that included Twenty-Mile Shop (Er Shi Li Pu, ‰∫åÂçÅÈáåÈì∫), Source of the Cao River (Cao He Tou, ÊºïÊ≤≥Â§¥), Xu River Bridge (Xu He Qiao, ÂæêÊ≤≥Ê°•) and Sun's Village (Sun Zhuang, Â≠ôÂ∫Ñ), badly mauling the local garrison that consisted of the 2nd and 3rd Security Divisions in the process. The Communist success forced the Nationalists to send out reinforcements: the 16th Army and the 43rd Division of the 94th Army reached an area south of Liang Township (Liang Xiang, ËâØ‰π°) via the Beijing‚ÄìHankou railroad, and the 5th Division and the 121st Division of the 94th Army reached the region of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, ÂåóÊ≤≥Â∫ó), from Dingxing (ÂÆöÂÖ¥). Little did the Nationalists know that the enemy was waiting to ambush them. On June 28 a portion of the 6th Brigade of the Communist 2nd Column and the 7th and 8th Brigades of the 3rd Column stopped the Nationalist reinforcements at Shiwuji (ÂçÅ‰∫îÊ±≤), the region south of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, ÂåóÊ≤≥Â∫ó), while the bulk of the 6th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column attempted to outflank the reinforcements from behind. After being ambushed from the flank, the Nationalists immediately withdrew to the north of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, ÂåóÊ≤≥Â∫ó), thus successfully avoiding besiegement, but in doing so their attempts to reinforce were doomed. As a result, by the evening of June 28 the Communist 3rd Column took Solid City (Gu Cheng, Âõ∫Âüé); the local garrison of the town, consisting of a regiment of the 121st Division of the 94th Army, was completely annihilated. In addition, in a stretch from the region of Tian's Village Shop (Tian Cun Pu, Áî∞ÊùëÈì∫) to the region of Northern River Hotel (Bei He Dian, ÂåóÊ≤≥Â∫ó), all Nationalist strongholds along the railway had fallen into enemy hands. In order to lure out the Nationalists in Baoding for an ambush, from July 4‚Äì6 the Communist 4th Column took regions including Horse Factory (Ma Chang, È©¨ÂéÇ), Xie's Village (Xie Zhuang, Ë∞¢Â∫Ñ), Northern and Southern Strange Villages (Nan ‚Äì Bei Qi Cun, ÂçóÂåóÂ•áÊùë) west of Baoding, and wiped out the 1,000 Nationalist reinforcements, consisting of security regiments from Full City (Man Cheng, Êª°Âüé) and Completed County (Wan Xian, ÂÆåÂéø). The Nationalists in Baoding refused to be lured out and the campaign thus concluded with a Communist victory. Outcome The defeated Nationalists suffered more than 8,200 casualties and the critical communication / transportation line of the Beijing‚ÄìHankou railroad was cut by the enemy as a result.

Most of his poetry is about romance, nature, feelings.SOSREALƒ∞ZM Bƒ∞Z∆è N∆è VERDƒ∞? - Elchin Afandiyev (non- English) Despite this, he soon became one of the slandered and criticized poets in the Union of Soviet Azerbaijani Writers, and soon afterwards, Mushfig was arrested and executed by Soviet authorities at the age of 30 during the Stalinist purges in the USSR. In 1956, he was exonerated posthumously. Nikita Khrushchev era of de-stalinization has resulted in Mushfig's poetry being famous in Azerbaijani society. Life and poetry Mushfig museum close to Xƒ±zƒ±. Mikayil Mushfig was born in the city of Baku of Baku Governorate in 1908. His father Mirza Abdulgadir Ismayilzade was a teacher and a poet. He lost his parents in early childhood, so was brought up by the relatives. He received his elementary education at Russian-language School in Baku. After the establishment of the Soviet regime in Azerbaijan in 1920, he studied at Baku Teacher's School and in 1931, he graduated from the Department of Language and Literature of the Baku State University. Mushfig married Dilber Akhundzade in 1933. Mikayil started his professional career as a school teacher. While being involved in teaching he started writing poems. His first poem Bir G√ºn (\\"The Day\\") was published in the Ganj fahla newspaper in Baku in 1926. At about this time, he adopted the pen name Mushfig (Perso-Arabic for \\"tender-hearted\\"). Along with Samad Vurgun and Rasul Rza, Mikayil Mushfig became one of the founders of new Azerbaijani Soviet poetic style in 1930s. He translated a number of poems from Russian as well. Mikayil Mushfig was active propagandist of traditional Azerbaijani musical instruments, which had been forbidden at that time.–ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤-—á–ª–µ–Ω–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –Æ–ù–ï–°–ö–û –ø—Ä–∏–µ–º–ª–µ–º—ã–º–∏ In his poetry, Mushfig glorified the work of industrial workers and peasants and lauded the construction of industrial enterprises in Baku and other cities. According to Mushfig's wife, Dilbar Akhundzadeh, Mikayil welcomed the transition from the Perso-Arabic script to the Latin script that took place in Azerbaijan in 1927. His excitement was expressed in the following verse:Farid Alakbarov, \\"Poet Mikayil Mushfig,\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 10:3 (Autumn 2002), pp. 50-51. :And at parting, :My soul wants to tell you: :\\"Goodbye! Your last day has come, :Wretched old alphabet!\\" When Stalin and Mir Jafar Baghirov decreed that traditional Azerbaijani musical instruments, including the tar, were to be banned, Mushfig wrote a poem in response titled \\"Sing Tar, Sing\\". The popularity of his poem with the public convinced the authorities to rescind the tar ban. Arrest and execution In late 1930s, as confessed by writer Mehdi Huseyn in one of the Ilyas Afandiyev's memories, it was very common among poets and writers to slander each other and accuse each other of nationalism or spreading religious propaganda. The reasons of such slanders were generally connected with personal problems and bitter rivalries between certain poets and writers.Agalar Memmedov - an interview with Heydar Huseynov Mushfig also came under the barrage of criticism in the Azerbaijani Writers' Union along with some other literary figures of the era such as Huseyn Javid, Ahmed Javad and Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli by some of the literary figures who were serving the interests of Stalin's regime in the USSR branded Mushfig as a \\"chauvinist\\" and a \\"petit-bourgeois poet\\".Dilbar Akhundzadeh, \\"My days with Mushfiq\\", Baku, 1968 He was arrested in 1937, charged with treason as \\"the enemy of the state\\", and executed in 1939 in the Bayil prison near Baku. He was later officially exonerated. Even though Mushfig wrote poems about Joseph Stalin, during the de-Stalinization policy of the USSR he was portrayed as an \\"anti- Stalinist\\" poet. On May 23, 1956, under the decision of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of USSR, Mikayil Mushfig was acquitted after his death. A working group consisting of the members of National Academy of Sciences, the ministries of Health and Culture, besides other relevant authorities was set up under the instruction of the President Ilham Aliyev in October 2018 in order to investigate recently spread information about the unearthed remains of the poet.

Biography Millico was born at Terlizzi, near Bari. In 1754, he came to Naples. In 1757 in Rome, he had his first performance as a singer. From 1758 to 1765, he worked in Russia, and then returned to Italy. In 1769, Gluck adapted the role of Orpheus in his Orfeo ed Euridice for Millico to perform at Parma -- the original role, composed for the alto castrato Gaetano Guadagni, was transposed up for Millico's soprano voice and the whole opera turned into an act of the celebratory work Le feste d'Apollo.Hayes In 1770, Millico sang, in the Vienna revival of Alceste, the originally tenor role of Admetus, which Gluck had specially rewritten for him, and created the role of Paris in the same composer's Paride ed Elena, the last in the trilogy of his Italian reform operas. \\"Gluck and Millico became firm friends, and Gluck entrusted the musical education of his beloved niece [Marianna] to Millico's care‚Äîno small tribute to the singer's musicianship\\".Howard, p. 71 After interpreting the role of Rinaldo in Antonio Sacchini's Armida, which was given at Milan's Teatro Regio Ducale during the 1772 Carnival season, Millico decided to partner the composer in his moving to London, in order to serve as the \\"primo musico\\" (principal castrato) at the King's Theatre. Here he performed the leading male roles in the first London operas by Sacchini (Il Cid and Tamerlano, both in 1773).DiChiera, p. 114 He was also involved in a failed attempt to counteract \\"the progressive watering-down, pasticcio- fashion,\\" of Gluck‚Äôs Orfeo which had been initiated in London in 1770 with the active participation of Guadagni.Eve Barsham, Orpheus in England, in Patricia Howard, p. 63 et seq. Taking advantage of the availability at the King‚Äôs Theatre of both Parma main performers, Millico and Antonia Maria Girelli Aguilar,Croll; Alessandra Cruciani, Girelli, Antonia Maria, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 56, 2001, Treccani on-line an original Gluck version of Orfeo and Euridice in one act was billed in summer 1773, but it turned out to be a complete fiasco and was dropped after only two performances. Georges Sauv√©, Antonio Sacchini 1730-1786 - Un musicien de Marie-Antoinette - Br√©viaire biographique, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2006, p 39 (). On his way back homeward in 1774, Millico called on Gluck in Paris and, as the French version of Orfeo ed Euridice was in laborious rehearsal, the composer would give two private test performances \\"at the house of the Abb√© Morellet in which the tenor role of the French score was sung by Millico (with Gluck's niece Marianne taking both Eurydice and Cupid, and with Gluck at the harpsichord)\\". After performing at Venice, Florence, Rome and Milan, Millico returned to Naples in 1780, where he became highly popular as a composer and teacher.Croll and Brandenburg He taught singing to the Bourbon princesses Maria Teresa and Luisa Maria, and to Emma Hamilton, not yet the lover of Lord Nelson. During this time at Naples, he composed eight operas that are confirmed as being his work, nearly all of which premiered in Naples -- two to libretti by Metastasio and one to words by Ranieri de' Calzabigi, Gluck's librettist for all three of his Italian reform operas. The published score of Millico's opera La piet√† d‚Äôamore includes a message of support for Gluck's attempted reforms of opera seria. Millico also composed eight cantatas, a Salve regina, 23 arias and 22 duets unattached to a dramatic work, and 82 canzonets. These works are usually composed for harp accompaniment and were extremely popular at the time; many of them were published, both individually and as a part of collections. A collection of his keyboard compositions, Musical Trifles: a Collection of Sonatine, was published in 1791 in London. He remained at Naples, where he died.

GRIN-Global Web v 1.9.4.2: Taxonomy of Vanilla planifolia It is cultivated and harvested primarily in Veracruz, Mexico, Tahiti, Indonesia, and Madagascar. Description Like all members of the genus Vanilla, V. planifolia is a vine. It uses its fleshy roots to support itself as it grows. =Flowers= Vanilla planifolia, flower Flowers are greenish-yellow, with a diameter of 5 cm (2 in). They last only a day, and must be pollinated manually, during the morning, if fruit is desired. The plants are self-fertile, and pollination simply requires a transfer of the pollen from the anther to the stigma. If pollination does not occur, the flower is dropped the next day. In the wild, there is less than 1% chance that the flowers will be pollinated, so in order to receive a steady flow of fruit, the flowers must be hand-pollinated when grown on farms. =Fruit= Fruit is produced only on mature plants, which are generally over 3 m (10 ft) long. The fruits are 15‚Äì23 cm (6‚Äì9 in) long pods (often incorrectly called beans). Outwardly they resemble small bananas. They mature after about five months, at which point they are harvested and cured. Curing ferments and dries the pods while minimizing the loss of essential oils. Vanilla extract is obtained from this portion of the plant. Chemistry The major chemical components from the pods are vanillin, vanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.Reinvestigation of vanillin contents and component ratios of vanilla extracts using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. Scharrer A and Mosandl A, Deutsche Lebensmittel-Rundschau, 2001, volume 97, number 12, pages 449-456, Contact dermatitis Illustration of allergic contact dermatitis When propagating vanilla orchids from cuttings or harvesting ripe vanilla pods, care must be taken to avoid contact with the sap from the plant's stems. The sap of most species of Vanilla orchid which exudes from cut stems or where pods are harvested can cause moderate to severe dermatitis if it comes in contact with bare skin. Washing the affected area with warm soapy water will effectively remove the sap in cases of accidental contact with the skin. The sap of vanilla orchids contains calcium oxalate crystals, which appear to be the main causative agent of contact dermatitis in vanilla plantation workers.

Even more overt is the script which features lines like, 'A racetrack is like a woman...a man weathers so much banality in pursuit of the occasional orgasmic moment.' What distinguishes Genuine Risk is the offhandedness of its violence, where people are beaten or die painfully, abruptly and without reason in stagings that capture the disturbing tone of videotapes of real events from surveillance cameras. It also has some wryness and novelty in its plot and casting, most notably Terrence Stamp as a 60's British pop star turned petty mobster.\\"Alain Silver, Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, \\"Genuine Risk\\", P.421‚Äì422 Voss himself said, \\"Genuine Risk was a movie with Peter Berg and Terence Stamp that was done as part of the noir wave of the time.

Anders ‚Äì who is best known for directing the award winning 1992 indie cult classic Gas Food Lodging ‚Äì and Voss consider this to be the final film in their rock n' roll trilogy, which includes the 1987 flick Border Radio, a snap shot of the LA punk scene starring real life rockers John Doe from X and Dave Alvin from The Blasters, and the 1999 film \\"Sugar Town\\", which stars John Taylor from Duran Duran as an aging rocker.\\" During the production, cast and crew drove into the high desert, where they shot an improvisational scene in Room 8 at the Joshua Tree Inn to perform a seance for country-rocker Gram Parsons, who died there. The on-camera tributes and interactions were spontaneous and raw.Steve Appleford, Los Angeles Times, \\"Allison Anders and Kurt Voss Keep the Music Playing\\", April 13, 2013, P.D3\\"It's real vomit in the movie when the kids are sick from drink at the strip club,\\" noted Voss of the mostly young cast. \\"They carried on like little hellions.\\" Arte-TV called the film \\"...Pure Punk Rock.\\"Florian Kummert, Tracks, Arte-TV, November 2, 2012. Hollywood Reporter said: \\"Anders and Voss are greatly helped in their effort by a fresh-faced and talented cast, led by (Flannery) Lunsford, whose quiet desperation always has the undertones of a guy almost ready to explode, with Elyse Hollander and Sara Ashley delivering charming supporting turns as friends trying to keep him just on the right side of crazy.\\" In July 2012, Voss and Ashley attended the Munich Film Festival for the world premiere of Strutter. The couple also took the film to Pop Montreal Film Festival in Quebec, Canada. In October 2012, the pair again represented the film, this time before the Japanese press, at the Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurt and Sara next surfaced in July, 2014 with a musical project entitled Sadistic Hands, releasing debut single and video, \\"So Low\\".https://vimeo.com/102313687 Strutter was released theatrically in Japan on September 14, 2013. It awaits digital distribution in the U.S., although as recently as July 2014 it has screened at repertory theaters, often with Voss and Anders in attendance to discuss the film's production methods and the viability of crowd source financing. Anders and Voss also co-wrote Things Behind The Sun (2001), which was awarded a Peabody Award in 2002.  Music  In addition to his film work, Voss is a founding member of the West Coast punk band The Hindi Guns, an outfit which produced three albums.David Fricke, Rolling Stone Magazine, March 4, 2004, P.65 Of the debut album, \\"The Hindi Guns\\" (2004, French Fan Club Records), Rolling Stone magazine's Senior Editor David Fricke wrote, \\"I've already found one of my favorite new bands of the year: a rough, bewitching four-piece from Portland...'I Don't Want To Drink Mercury' is your best ticket into these ten tracks: a bluesy crawl set in dub- like darkness, like early Hole produced by Lee Perry.\\" Early vinyl pressings of the album found their way into the hands of the late and legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ, John Peel, who put three of the album tracks into rotation on his BBC program.BBC RADIO ONE - home page - Peel Tracklistings http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/tracklistings/peel_archive_shtml.shtml?20040302 The album was supported by a West Coast tour which was filmed for a short tour diary. The Hindi Guns second album, Rarities (2009), was a collection of EP material, B-sides and studio outtakes. The album was reviewed in Record Collector by British punk critic Kris Needs, who gave the record four stars:Kris Needs, Record Collector Magazine, Sept 2009, p. 84 \\"Anyone who dedicates a song to 'Instant Karma and The Peel Sessions' must have their heart in the right place. The late DJ was a fan and it's not hard to see why.\\" After the departure of original singer Dee Dee Cheriel, the founding members of Hindi Guns made a third album, entitled Do Or Die (French Fan Club Records, 2009). The CD featured a photo of a sword-wielding Yukio Mishima; the back cover of the record depicted a photo of the author's severed head. The album received college radio play, and an honorable mention in the annual roundup of \\"Year's Best\\" by ex-Times pop writer Kevin Bronson.Hindi Guns in Buzzbands, 2009 http://www.buzzbands.la/2009/12/22/popular-with-me-2009-my-favorite- albums/ In July 2014, Kurt Voss announced via his Google page that he and Sara Ashley were commencing upon a music project entitled Sadistic Hands. The pair released a series of internet singles followed by a full-length album in January 2015, available on cdbaby and iTunes. Personal life From 1990 to 1993, Kurt Voss was married to British actress Sammi Davis, with whom he made the film Horseplayer. The couple married in Las Vegas.Soren Anderson, Tacoma News Tribune, \\"Expatriate: Sammi Davis glad to be out of England and in LA,\\" July 5, 1991 Davis said Voss had her face tattooed on his upper arm when they said, \\"I do.\\"Lorelei Lewis, Star Magazine, \\"Homefront star's hubby has her face drawn on his arm\\", May 5, 1992, p. 5 \\"He told me that if we got divorced, he'd have it made into a horse.\\"Lorelei Lewis, Star Magazine, \\"Homefront star's hubby has her face drawn on his arm, May 5, 1992, p. 5 Voss married actress Sara Ashley in May 2012. The two met while on set of Strutter, in which she acted. The two debuted a new band,Sadistic Hands, in the Spring of 2014.

It was announced in March 2007, by Phil Harrison at the Game Developers Conference. The game includes user-generated content allowing users to create their own levels. The game received critical acclaim from critics and has been praised for its presentation, including its graphics, physics, and audio, along with its gameplay and large array of customisable costumes and online features. Additional praise was given to its scope and future potential based on user-created content; minor criticism was reserved for specific elements of the gameplay mechanics and level creation facilities. LittleBigPlanet has won a number of awards. A PSP version of the game was released in November 2009, featuring new levels. The game was offered by Sony as a free download as part of their 'Welcome Back' program, following the PlayStation Network outage of 2011. A sequel, LittleBigPlanet 2, was released in 2011. Gameplay The game revolves around the player's control of a small character, known as a \\"Sackboy\\", in a variety of platforming levels. Though the game features a set of pre-built levels for the player to explore, the game's customisable nature is equally important, from altering the player's character and personal space, to building entirely new objects and levels, and sharing and playing them online with other players as part of the LittleBigPlanet community. Sackboy can run and jump and grab certain objects. Grabbable objects can have the designation of being purely for mobility, such as swinging, or they can be pushed, pulled, switched, or operate in other manners. The player uses these abilities in several ways: to play and explore the environments that come with the game, which feature platforming elements such as jumping, pushing, grabbing and running, and which make use of the game's robust physics engine; to create their own content, such as placing stickers into levels, in addition to using the level editor to create, destroy, edit and manipulate levels; and to share creations, by publishing items such as levels and objects with the online community, and play these creations online with others. These three modes are described by the title's tagline: Play. Create. Share. Through the \\"pod\\", a personal space, the player can access the three modes of gameplay, and decorate the room with stickers and decorations. Initially, only the Play mode is available and the player must complete the first area of the game and some tutorials, narrated by Stephen Fry. Once the basics are mastered, the player is free to play the rest of the game. The Play section of LittleBigPlanet consists of a number of levels that have been created by Media Molecule, and are based around different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations and events, such as medieval European castles (the Gardens), dry African savannah (the Savannah), the Day of the dead in Mexico (the Wedding), dry Mexican deserts (the Cannyons), New York City streets (the Metropolis), Japanese gardens (the Islands), Indian palaces like the Taj Mahal (the Temples), and icy Russian stages (the Wilderness). By completing the levels available to them (by reaching the scoreboard), the player may advance the story and play further unlocked levels. The story mode comprises eight themed areas, with each area containing three or four main levels, and some of these levels in turn contain collectable keys to unlock bonus mini-levels. The main story mode comprises more than 50 pre-built levels in total. A screenshot from the Savannah level \\"Swinging Safari\\". To control their Sackboy character, the player moves by using the analogue sticks, jump with varying degrees of height depending on the pressure applied to the action button, and grab onto objects to either move or swing on them. In addition to regular left-and-right movement, and despite the 2D look of the game, levels consist of three levels of depth‚Äîthe foreground, middleground and background‚Äîand may be traversed between either automatically by the game itself, or by the player's command. The player can opt to emote their Sackboy by applying varying degrees of delight, fear, sadness, and rage, control each arm independently through the analogue sticks, slap other players by jerking the arm movement with the analogue sticks, and use the Sixaxis motion-sensing functionality to animate the character's head and body. The player can access the Popit menu at any time during the game by pressing the square button. A large variety of pre-built objects are present in levels which may be interacted with. Those, along with objects that have been constructed out of simple shapes can be given specific materials, which act in a manner physically similar to those they represent. Examples include soft sponge, gripping rubber, and tough wood. Objects that are built with mechanical components, such as motors, pistons, jets, wires and springs also act appropriately. Along with these objects, levels contain dangers that the player must avoid. Examples include objects or platforms that have been set on fire, and explosives that can damage the player's Sackboy if he strays too close. Explosives can also be used to blow up sections of the level. The player's Sackboy can also be crushed to death if trapped under or between heavy items and drown in water. As the player progresses through the level, they encounter checkpoints - points from which the player can resume upon death. Each level contains a number of \\"score bubbles\\", which may be collected in order to increase the player's score to beat their own, and other players', high scores. Users may collect larger bubbles known as \\"prize bubbles\\" which contain collectable items. Many of these bubbles are hidden or are in hard-to- reach places, and contain items such as new stickers and decorations, or new materials and objects that may be used in the Create mode for the user's own levels. Certain stickers, when placed properly, trigger events. Special clothing and accessories for the player's Sackboy is obtained by completing a level without losing a life, also known as acing a level. In addition to the prize bubbles, collectable keys found in main levels unlock new mini-levels with unique goals, such as skipping a spinning pole or bouncing to grab bubbles. There are also unlockable time trial levels such as bobsleigh racing. Throughout the story mode, players collect prize bubbles which unlock materials, objects, stickers, decorations, sound effects and music tracks which can be used in Create mode. =Content creation= A demonstration of the character customisation available in LittleBigPlanet. The player may customise their character in a range of ways. They are able to select a base colour and texture for their Sackboy from a range of materials and designs along with giving them pre-made items including clothes, masks, swords and capes. By placing stickers and decorations on their Sackboy, it is possible to make new kinds of costumes. The game also features items based on other PlayStation franchises, such as a Helghast soldier from Killzone 2; and character models based on Kratos, Medusa, and the Minotaur from the God of War series; Nariko from Heavenly Sword; Old Snake, Raiden, Meryl, and Screaming Mantis from Metal Gear Solid 4; Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII; a Chimera from the Resistance series; as well as Ryu, Guile, Chun Li, and Zangief from Street Fighter; characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise; and Ezio from Assassin's Creed II. Although the Create aspect does include minor tweaks to existing levels whilst they are being played, such as placing stickers and decorations in levels, the main focus of this mode is the level editor. The editor incorporates a large number of editing facilities to create levels from a low to a high degree of complexity. The player may create new objects by starting with a number of basic shapes, such as circles, stars and squares, and \\"painting\\" a shape into the level using one of the many materials. Objects may be glued to each other or to the level. More mechanical features are also available, such as connecting objects together with string, using bolts to spin objects, or using various kinds of triggers. Rocket motors can be attached to objects to propel them across a level. After creating custom objects, the player may save their creation to a library for later use, and share their object by placing it inside a prize bubble in their level, so that other players who play the level can collect it and may use it in their own levels. In order to facilitate the creation process and to accommodate any mistakes made, the editor features a manipulatable time system, whereby the player may \\"rewind\\" the editor, which acts as an undo feature, or pause the editor, which temporarily halts objects that run under the physics engine, such as gravity acting on falling or rolling objects. In addition to his narration for other parts of the game, Stephen Fry provides the voice-over for the large number of video and interactive tutorials that accompany the create mode, a number of which must be completed in full before unlocking a new set of objects for use. User-generated content is not limited to the player's region, but is available worldwide. Although the feature was initially announced with the game, the ability to use create mode with other players online was not included in the final release. This functionality was added to the game through a software patch in November 2009 following a public closed beta test. Users are able to invite up to three people from their PlayStation Network Friends list to join them and create levels together. =Online community features= A large part of LittleBigPlanet is the global community features through the PlayStation Network for the player to interact and share their \\"patches\\"‚Äîlevels and other modifications‚Äîas well as online play. As of September 2011, more than 5 million user-created levels have been published. The main focus of the Share component is the ability for level creators to publish their levels and objects to the online community for other people to play. Once a custom level has been played through, the player is able to tag the level with a list of predefined words, and may cycle through the word choice to find the most appropriate. This allows other players to quickly find their level of choice. The player can search by a specific tag such as \\"Beautiful\\". The player has a \\"heart\\" feature available to them, which allows them to specify which levels, stickers and decorations they prefer; in this way, people can heart to show appreciation for other people's creations, and visit their online friend's hearted items, or visit the creator of a hearted item, then view his or her hearted items, and so on. An official community website called the LittleBigWorkshop complements the in-game sharing features. Logging on with their PlayStation Network IDs, users are able to create blueprints for level designs, view in-depth tutorials and take part in challenges. It is additionally the home of the official forums. Among its other features, the website allows users to upload in-game videos and photos. LittleBigPlanet features a range of multiplayer options. Levels can be played online with up to four players, locally with up to four players or with a mixture of up to four online and local players. Up to four local users can play together in Create mode, whilst the ability to create levels with up to four players online has been added in an update. The way in which users undertake the level is dependent on the design of the level and how the users choose to play, allowing the players to choose whether they play cooperatively or battle against each other to get to the finish line first, or collect the most bubbles. In the weeks following the game's release, some users reported on community forums that levels they had created had been taken down for \\"moderation\\", and were no longer available to play. A representative from Sony stated that once a level is flagged by players using the in-game Good Grief system, levels were reviewed by a moderator and only removed if deemed inappropriate. On 11 November 2008, SCE confirmed that around 200 levels ‚Äîless than 0.5 percent of levels published ‚Äî had been removed, the majority of which contained obscenity, while the rest were removed due to copyright violations. Media Molecule acknowledged there were issues with the moderation system and released an update in December to help rectify them. In addition to an on- screen message, users are notified with a PSN message when a level they have published is removed, along with information on the reason for its removal. They are able to play and edit the level themselves whether on or offline. The developers have clarified the rules regarding what is and is not appropriate and have made several changes \\"behind the scenes\\" which they hope will \\"alleviate most of the issues that creators have experienced.\\" Web-based portal and API LBP.me allows people to search for levels from a web browser. In May 2009, Alex Evans revealed that a new community website was in development that will serve as a web-based portal to help users promote their levels. Shortly before the release of LittleBigPlanet 2 a new community website was launched with the aim of enabling users to find and share in-game creations more easily. LBP.me allows players to search and browse community- made levels from both LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2. Every level is allocated a unique URL which users can copy and share with other people. When signed into the website with their Sony Entertainment Network account, users may add levels to their 'Queue' enabling them to find the level quickly when they are in the game and connected to the game's servers. Website owners may use a selection of widgets to add live data from the game to any website. A public API is also available but access to it is provided by the game's developers on a case-by-case basis. =Interface= The game's main interface is based around the player's \\"pod\\" and three planets, each of which is focused on the three areas of the game; \\"Play\\", \\"Create\\" and \\"Share\\". These are accessed using the \\"pod computer\\". The main Play planet is the \\"LittleBigPlanet\\". This is where users access the main story levels and also serves as the main gateway to user-created levels. The LittleBigPlanet features an interface into the PlayStation Store where users can access and purchase downloadable content. The Create planet, called \\"My Moon\\", is where players save and access levels they have created or copied. Each crater on the moon holds one or more levels. The Share planet, or \\"Info Moon\\", is where players can access their friends list, gameplay statistics and their hearted levels and creators. The user can select a person on their friends list to view their published levels, hearted levels and hearted creators. The \\"Popit\\" is a menu which provides access to costumes, decorations, stickers, materials, editing tools, and messaging features. It is contextual and displays certain sets of options, depending on whether the user is playing a level, editing a level, or in their pod. Stickers and decorations can be plastered onto any surface in the game world, and can be used to decorate something, or to activate certain switches. Stickers may be created by the player, either using an in-game camera (allowing them to take pictures of in-game scenarios), or they can use the PlayStation Eye. However, the ability to import images from the player's console hard drive has not yet been implemented, and is not planned. Plot LittleBigPlanet is set in a world full of creations made by Creator Curators. One of the Curators, a rogue Creator called \\"the Collector\\", is stealing the other Creators' creations and not sharing them with the world (sharing is one of the core elements of LittleBigPlanet). Play starts at the \\"Gardens\\" level, where the player meets the King, one of the Curators; the Queen; Little Xim; Big Zam and Dumpty. The player is taught the basic gameplay at this stage: running, jumping, and grabbing. The next setting is the \\"Savannah\\", where the player accidentally breaks one of the ruler's creations. In return for forgiveness the player must investigate what's scaring the ruler's buffalo. Further adventures involve finding Meerkat Mum's son and a Bridegroom (a story arc with a Day of the Dead theme). After the wedding play moves to the \\"Canyons\\", where the player must rescue Uncle Jalape√±o and defeat the evil Sheriff Zapata. After completing this the player is taken to the \\"Metropolis\\" and gets a car for a race scenario. The next adventure takes place on the \\"Islands\\", where the player is trained in martial arts and must defeat the Terrible Oni. From there the player goes to the \\"Temples\\", to get a flame-throwing cat. Here they meet the Great Magician, who tells them to defeat the Collector in his \\"Wilderness\\". After the final battle the Collector is revealed to be a little, lonely man who kidnapped everyone because he did not have any friends. Everyone, including the player, offers to be his friend and he accepts, ending his being evil. Development LittleBigPlanet's origin lies in a conversation between Media Molecule co-founders Mark Healey and Dave Smith after a cinema visit to see Howl's Moving Castle. Healey and Smith discussed a game that had character controls similar to their previous game, Rag Doll Kung Fu, that would be playable on a console. Healey and Smith left Lionhead Studios in December 2005 along with other Media Molecule co- founders Alex Evans and art director Kareem Ettouney, and managed to arrange a meeting with Phil Harrison, the then-head of development for SCE Worldwide Studios. They created a prototype of their idea, a game called Craftworld, a physics-based, 2D side-scrolling game, with a place holder character called Mr. Yellowhead. Mr. Yellowhead's arms were controllable with the right analogue stick of the PlayStation 2 controller that Media Molecule had connected to their PC, whilst his legs were controlled with the left stick. The object of the game was to guide Mr. Yellowhead past a number of obstacles by grabbing onto objects and pushing or rolling them around. A screenshot of the early prototype, Craftworld, depicting Mr. Yellowhead dragging blocks from water. They chose to pitch their idea to Harrison using their own software, rather than PowerPoint, which allowed for bullet point information as in standard presentations, but also for live, controllable movement of game characters. By their own admission, the pitch was vague and they had deliberately toned down the creative aspect of the game‚Äîwhich they felt may have appeared as \\"weird\\" for a console game‚Äîfor fear of negative reception of their pitch by Sony. They presented the prototype purely as a playable game, and only briefly mentioned the user created content aspect; Evans relates that Harrison actually picked up on the creative side, and had asked them why they had chosen not to explore this element further. The meeting, which had been scheduled to last 45 minutes, eventually lasted 3 hours at the end of which, Sony agreed to fund the project for six months. After some further development, the team were asked to present what they had done to Sony in what Healey describes as a \\"Dragons' Den style scenario\\". Following this, Sony gave them a deal to develop LittleBigPlanet for the PlayStation 3 in exchange for exclusivity and ownership of the intellectual property. Media Molecule became incorporated as a company in February 2006. Despite backing from Sony, Media Molecule were unsure about exactly what direction they were going to take the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule were aware of the fact that Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game‚Äîmuch more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated. The game was less than one year into development, when it was first shown at GDC 2007. Evans remarked that this public approach to the game's development meant they had been able to react to feedback from the community, and the game had been specifically designed to allow them to easily implement further developments in the future, based on demand from players. In the game players can earn an in-game costume of Mr. Yellowhead by completing the last level in the Story Mode without losing a life. =Marketing= Both Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule undertook a large-scale marketing campaign in the run-up to the game's release. In North America, SCEA partnered with several major online retailers to offer unique bonus gifts to customers pre-ordering the game from the selected retailers. These gifts include codes to access additional in-game costumes, a sticker book, a burlap pouch and an official game guide. In the UK, SCEE partnered with online retailers to offer downloadable costumes, such as the Nariko character from Heavenly Sword, to customers who pre-order the game. A temporary shop in the UK was set up in Manchester city centre, where people were able to play the game before its release. The shop moved to central London in October. In addition to a chance to play the game, it offered such activities as T-shirt making. To market the game to an online audience, a website campaign to \\"reclaim Pluto as the ninth planet\\", Proposition Pluto, was released as a marketing tool several weeks before the game's release. On 17 December 2009, LittleBigPlanet content including virtual clothing and furniture was released for PlayStation Home. Users are also now able to meet players and launch into an online LittleBigPlanet game from within PlayStation Home with advanced options. On 13 May 2010, a LittleBigPlanet Game Space was released in PlayStation Home called the \\"LittleBigPlanet PlayGround\\". It features a mini-game called the King's Snap Happy Photo Challenge where users find the target, snap a shot, and unlock Home rewards. There's also a sub-space called \\"The Creator\\" where users can create their own wallpapers for their PS3's XMB and coming soon is the LittleBigPlanetDerby which will be a carnival style mini-game. In addition to the Game Space, a personal space was released that users can purchase called the \\"LittleBigPlanet Pod Penthouse\\" which is designed after the Pod in LittleBigPlanet. =Release/Re-release = A demo version of the game was planned for release on the PlayStation Network in the fourth quarter of 2007, but was delayed until 2008. The demo was again delayed until 11 September 2009, when it was released alongside the Game of The Year Edition. Original announcements pointed to a full release early in 2008, but Sony later said the game had been delayed until September 2008 in the UK. During the Sony PlayStation Day on 6 May 2008 in London, Sony announced the game would be delayed for one month, but also confirmed release dates for 21 October 2008 in North America, 22 October in Europe, 24 October in the UK and Ireland, and 30 October in Japan. (Translation ) Originally intended for a release in mid-to- late October, a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack delayed the game's release worldwide. It was released in North America and Japan at the end of October 2008, and in Europe at the beginning of November 2008. On 17 October 2008, SCEE instigated a worldwide recall of LittleBigPlanet and announced the game's release be pushed back after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licensed songs in the game included passages from the Qur'an and could therefore be offensive to Muslims. However, no actual complaints regarding the music were made. To: Sony Computer Entertainment & Media Molecule While playing your latest game, \\"LittleBigPlanet\\" in the first level of the third world in the game (titled \\"Swinging Safari\\"), I have noticed something strange in the lyrics of the music track of the level. When I listened carefully, I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran. You can listen to part of the track here: mt14.quickshareit.com/share/p...lip22503c0.wav The words are: 1- In the 18th second: \\"ŸÉŸÑ ŸÜŸÅÿ≥ ÿ∞ÿßÿ¶ŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ™\\" (\\"kollo nafsin tha'iqatol mawt\\", literally: 'Every soul shall have the taste of death'). 2- Almost immediately after, in the 27th second: \\"ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸäŸáÿß ŸÅÿßŸÜ\\" (\\"kollo man alaiha fan\\", literally: 'All that is on earth will perish'). I asked many of my friends online and offline and they heard the exact same thing that I heard easily when I played that part of the track. Certain Arabic hardcore gaming forums are already discussing this, so we decided to take action by emailing you before this spreads to mainstream attention. We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our Holy Quran deeply offending. We hope you would remove that track from the game immediately via an online patch, and make sure that all future shipments of the game disk do not contain it. We would also like to mention that this isn't the first time something like this happened in videogames. Nintendo's 1998 hit \\"Zelda: Ocarina of Time\\" contained a musical track with islamic phrases, but it was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations. Last year, Capcom's \\"Zack & Wiki\\" and Activision's \\"Call of Duty 4\\" also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games, and both companies thankfully removed the content. We hope you act immediately to avoid any confusion and unnecessary controversy, and we thank you for making such an amazing game. Regards, yasser The song, entitled \\"Tapha Niang\\", was by Malian artist Toumani Diabat√©, himself a devout Muslim. The game was patched twice, the day before its release for players who had received the game early, before its intended release date. The first update did not affect the song, and was released to patch online issues, modify jetpack controls, and add further costumes, whilst the second updated the game to remove the vocals from the track, leaving only an instrumental. Some American Muslims responded to the recall and stated that they were offended by the restriction of freedom of speech. M. Zuhdi Jasser M.D., head of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, was quoted as saying, \\"Muslims cannot benefit from freedom of expression and religion and then turn around and ask that anytime their sensibilities are offended that the freedom of others be restricted.\\" SCEA announced new versions of the game that would be shipped to North American retailers the week commencing 27 October 2008. On 20 October 2008 an SCEE press release stated LittleBigPlanet would start to appear in stores in the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, Australia and New Zealand no later than the week commencing 3 November 2008 on a country-by-country basis. Later the same day SCEE confirmed the UK release date as 5 November. Beta phases A public beta version of the game was previously scheduled for the summer of 2008, but it was later announced that only private beta testing would take place; a public demo was mentioned as a \\"possibility\\". However, in a later interview, Alex Evans, Co-Founder of Media Molecule, said a beta would be released in September 2008 describing it as \\"a public beta, but limited at the same time\\". The first beta became playable on 23 September 2008, when gaming website Eurogamer began offering beta codes to its members on the same date, with a total of 5,800 codes available; the website quickly buckled under the influx of visitors, with many unable to load the site. Subsequently, several other gaming websites including 1UP.com and GameSpot offered beta codes to their users. Players were able to play the beta until it ended on 12 October. Although Sony had originally planned to erase all levels created by players during the beta period, an official poll was held to let the players decide their fate; the players voted to keep the levels. These levels were carried over to the final game, although save game data and progress made in the beta was not. =Future developments and downloadable content= A feature the title lacks, but was included in demonstrations, is the ability to create stickers by importing images from the console's hard drive. When initially asked about the missing feature, Alex Evans replied that its removal was due to time constraints, and that a patch before Christmas would enable the feature. A later forum post from a PlayStation official countered this by stating image import would not be appearing \\"for a variety of reasons\\". Further speculation arose when Media Molecule posted an image to their Flickr page after both statements were made, showing the image import tool in action, and a television advert for the game demonstrated family photographs in a custom level. It was originally intended that players would be able to use the content creation mode with other players online however this feature was dropped before the game's release. Online Create was added to the game via software update 1.21 . In a demonstration at the 2009 Tokyo Games Show, footage of LittleBigPlanet being played with PlayStation Move was shown. This led to many people to believe that a PlayStation Move DLC pack would be released, allowing the creation of Move levels. It was later revealed that the footage was from a spin-off game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves, and a Move pack was later released for the sequel, LittleBigPlanet 2. Major updates and downloadable content packs On 23 December 2008, weapons were introduced into the game with the release of a Metal Gear-themed game pack titled \\"Metal Gear Solid Level Pack\\". A paintball gun power-up, called the \\"Paintinator\\", can be used to activate \\"Paintinator Switches\\", can destroy certain enemies, and can be picked up similarly to a jet-pack (which is by simply touching it). The player can also add the Paintinator to custom levels. The game pack includes new Metal Gear Solid-themed stickers, music that can be placed in user-created levels, and various character costumes. In April 2009, Media Molecule released a free software update dubbed \\"Cornish Yarg\\", the first major update for the game. New features that were introduced with this update include the ability for the user to play their own music from the PlayStation 3's hard drive whilst in their Pod or in \\"Create\\" mode, the ability to turn a prize collection in user-created levels on or off and improvements to the character customisation process. Changes were also made to some creation tools including the ability to hide mechanical objects such as bolts and pistons. Shortly after this update, Creator Pack 1 was released as a downloadable content pack for free. This pack added new Create mode tools including a new type of checkpoint which provides the player with an infinite number of lives for a given section, a tether-less version of the jet-pack (allowing the player to hover around more freely) and a power-up removal marker which forces the player to drop any power-ups such as the Paintinator or jet-pack. The update also included a tool to allow the creator to trigger changes in the entire level's lighting and other environmental settings, when the player passes a certain point or performs an action. In addition to characters from other franchises appearing in LittleBigPlanet, Sackboy has also appeared in other video games. In March 2009, an add-on was released for Everybody's Golf 5 which made Sackboy available as a playable character. Sackboy is also in Rag Doll Kung Fu: Fists Of Plastic, a game released on the PlayStation Network based on the 2005 PC game, Rag Doll Kung Fu by LittleBigPlanet creator, Mark Healy. Sackboy has also appeared in ModNation Racers and 3D Dot Game Heroes. A \\"Game Of The Year Edition\\" was released only in North America on 9 September 2009. The Game of the Year Edition includes many downloadable content packs, along with new levels made by various LittleBigPlanet community members. (See the Game of the Year Edition section.) In August 2009, Media Molecule announced that a future update would add water to the game. Eventually, it was revealed that the water would be released as part of a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed downloadable content pack that arrived on 22 December 2009. Much like the Metal Gear Solid pack, the premium downloadable content pack contained six new levels and also unlocks new Creator tools allowing users to use the new mechanics in their levels. It allows the user to add water to their levels, and these tools include a Global Water Object allowing users to trigger changes in the water properties of their levels as well as a water- activated switch, a scuba-gear pick-up and a bubble machine. The pack also features Pirates of the Caribbean-themed stickers, decorations, music, backdrops, objects and materials. Whilst users are required to purchase this pack in order to create levels with water and water-related items, users are able to play levels utilising the features whether they purchase the pack or not. =Game of the Year Edition= A Game of the Year Edition of LittleBigPlanet was released in North America on 8 September 2009. This version included all of the content from the original game, as well as exclusive levels from 18 members of the LittleBigPlanet community (along with short videos of each of them explaining the levels). The re-release also includes the \\"Metal Gear Solid\\", \\"Monsters\\", and \\"History\\" costume and level packs and the \\"Animals\\" costume pack. A limited number of copies of the game also included a code, giving the player access to a beta of ModNation Racers. Initially there were no plans to release the Game of the Year Edition in Europe, however a European version was eventually announced for release on 16 April 2010. The Korean language version of the Game of the Year Edition is available in South Korea. Reception =Previews= The unveiling of LittleBigPlanet at GDC 2007 elicited numerous positive reactions. In his BBC News blog, technology editor Darren Waters wrote, \\"LittleBigPlanet is perhaps one of the most dazzling demos I've seen in the last 10 years\\". IGN described the game as \\"beautiful\\" and reported that \\"even in the presence of Home, Sony's impressive new community software, LittleBigPlanet stole the show at Phil Harrison's Game 3.0 practice conference, and was the thing that everyone was talking about.\\" 1UP wrote that \\"There are plenty of questions remaining about LittleBigPlanet ‚Ä¶ but it's clear from the reaction to the game so far that it has already won over many fans and that this could be something very special.\\" Slashdot Games editor Michael Zenke suggested the game could be the PlayStation 3's killer application. Even Reggie Fils-Aime, the president of Nintendo of America, praised the product, but was unsure how the game would fare on Sony's platform. =Reviews= LittleBigPlanet has received wide critical acclaim from reviewers. The first major publication to review LittleBigPlanet was the UK edition of PlayStation Official Magazine. In their November edition they gave the game a score of 10/10 calling it \\"a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand\\". Eurogamer scored the game 9/10. Reviewer Oli Welsh commented specifically on the game's \\"unforgettable visuals\\" and that the accurate lighting was \\"as total a realisation of high-definition as you'll see anywhere in games this year\\". He similarly praised the multiplayer gameplay as \\"a loosely-structured scrum of competition, collaboration and sheer, joyful mucking around\\". Speaking of the game's comprehensive creation and community tools in contrast with its classic platforming gameplay, he calls the game \\"the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one\\". IGN (U.S.) scored it 9.5/10 and said the game was an \\"instant classic\\". The reviewer, Chris Roper, also suggested that the game may even be a reason to purchase a PlayStation 3; \\"If you own a PlayStation 3, you cannot miss this. If you don‚Äôt have a PS3 yet, this is the reason to get one.\\" GamePro scored the game 5/5 and said that the real strength of the game \\"is the tremendous sense of freedom and creativity that it instils in you.\\" Edge gave it a 10/10 and said \\"It's a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both.\\" Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamer's review stated that the jump timing sometimes feels \\"off by a fraction of a fraction of a second\\" and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In IGN's review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay \\"left a few corners on what should have been a razor-sharp control scheme\\". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration \\"isn't as quick as it could be\\" but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that \\"there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb.\\" This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that \\"The Z [axis] movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right. There's times when it annoys me actually.\\" He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended \\"in a somewhat disappointing manner\\" and the story as a whole doesn't make sense. =Awards= LittleBigPlanet has been given numerous awards. It won in eight categories out of ten nominations at the AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards including \\"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction\\", and \\"Outstanding Innovation in Gaming\\", and was judged \\"Family Game of the Year\\", \\"Console Game of the Year\\", and \\"Overall Game of the Year\\". LittleBigPlanet was also given the Award for Artistic Achievement at the 5th British Academy Video Games Awards. It was dubbed Game of the Year by several gaming websites and publications including GamePro, Edge, and Eurogamer whose editors felt that while the single-player experience was nothing special, the multiplayer gameplay brought the game into its own and were impressed by some of the user-created levels which inspired \\"gasps of wonder\\". It also received various other awards from gaming websites in 2008 including Best New IP and Best Platform Game from IGN and Most Innovative Game from GameTrailers. LittleBigPlanet was judged Best PlayStation 3 Game at the 2008 Spike Video Game Awards and was given the awards for Best New Debut, Best Game Design, Best Technology, and the Innovation Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards. =Sales= In the UK, the game entered the ELSPA video game charts at number four, then fell to number 19 in its second week of sale. By 29 November 2008, the game was at number 32 and had sold between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the game sold 356,000 units during October and November placing it fourth amongst all PlayStation 3 software sales for that period. It entered October's all-platform video game chart at number eight before falling out of the top 20 by the end of November. Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said \\"In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so you have to put the chart in context.\\" Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, LittleBigPlanet was released mid-week and as a result, its first week performance indicators are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, LittleBigPlanet sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009. In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3 million unique users playing LittleBigPlanet. As of March 2010, the game has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. SCEE President Andrew House announced at Gamescom 2010 that the game has now sold over 4.5 million worldwide. Sequel Media Molecule and Sony initially indicated that there were no plans to create a traditional sequel to LittleBigPlanet. Alex Evans said he didn't want to ship a traditional sequel because of the \\"huge emotional investment\\" users have made in LittleBigPlanet. Game creators focused on \\"expand[ing] the game without partitioning the audience\\" to preserve the user-generated content from LBP. In May 2010, Media Molecule announced that recent rumours of a full sequel were true and that LittleBigPlanet 2 was in development, and that users would be able to use all the DLC released for LittleBigPlanet and all its user- generated content. Games magazine Game Informer revealed the first details of LittleBigPlanet 2 in its June 2010 edition. The sequel was released in January 2011. PSP game In a February 2009 press release, Sony announced a version of LittleBigPlanet for the PlayStation Portable would be developed by SCE Studio Cambridge in conjunction with Media Molecule. LittleBigPlanet for the PSP was first shown publicly at E3 2009 and it was released in November 2009.

The name of the village translates to \\"watch-house of the vineyard\\", reflecting the town's fame for the quality of its grape vines.Asser, Martin. Inside a Palestinian refugee camp.

Stephanie was the maternal grandmother of John Aleman, and in 1249 he transferred land, including Beit Jann, Sajur, Nahf and Majd al-Krum to the Teutonic Knights.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 78‚Äì79, No. 100; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p.308, No. 1175; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 254. =Ottoman era= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Majd al- Krum appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Sanjak Safad. It had a population of 85 households and five bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olives or fruit trees, cotton, and goats and/or beehives; a total of 16,560 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 191.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. The modern historian Oren Yiftachel, writing in the 1990s, noted that Majd al-Krum was \\"founded centuries ago by Muslim Arabs\\". A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as El Megd El Kouroum.Karmon, 1960, p. 166. In 1838, Majd al-Krum was noted as a Muslim village in the Shaghur subdistrict, which was located between Safad, Acca and Tiberias.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 133 In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited and described Majd al-Krum as being divided into three quarters, each with a different sheikh. The total population was 800 Muslims,Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 437-438, 444 while in 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described it as a village built of stone and surrounded by olive trees and arable land, inhabited by 600‚Äì800 Muslims.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 150. A population list from about 1887 showed that Majd al-Krum had 1,075 inhabitants, all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 173 =British Mandatory period= Tegart police fort in Majd al-Krum, 2008 In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Majd al-Krum had a population of 889, of which 885 were Sunni Muslim, three Shia Muslims and one Christian.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 36 In the 1931 census, Majd al-Krum had 226 occupied houses and a population of 1,006 Muslims.Mills, 1932, p. 101 In the 1945 statistics, Majd al-Kurum had 1,400 inhabitants, all Muslims.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 4 They owned a total of 17,828 dunams of land, while 2214 dunams were public property.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 40 During the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt against British Mandatory rule and increased Jewish settlement in Palestine, Majd al-Krum was one of the first villages in the Galilee to participate in the revolt with a resident, Abu Faris, claiming he was the first individual to take up arms in the Galilee during the revolt and the first to have his house demolished by the British as punishment for his participation. Abu Faris became the second-in-command of the revolt in Galilee until 1938 when he refused an order to assassinate a Palestinian Arab supporter of the Peel Commission partition plan for Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Abu Faris later left Palestine for Lebanon after a major political leader of the revolt, Amin al-Husayni, ordered his assassination.Swedenburg, 2003, pp. 164‚Äì165. =1948 War and aftermath= Majd al-Krum and some of its residents soon after the village was captured by Israeli forces, 1948‚Äì1949 Majd al-Krum was captured by Israeli forces in October 1948 during Operation Hiram. A unit of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) that had been stationed there withdrew from the village upon the Israelis' approach. As he was departing, the ALA's Iraqi commander assembled the inhabitants around the village well and suggested that they not flee the village, but rather stay and surrender to Israeli officers that they knew. Accordingly, a group of Majd al-Krum's residents contacted Haim Auerbach, an Israeli intelligence officer based in Nahariya (who a group of villagers had previously defended from an attack near Acre). Auerbach arranged for Majd al- Krum's surrender and pledged no harm would come to the village.Cohen, 2010, pp. 105‚Äì106. However, on 6 November, an Israeli Army unit, unaware of the village's surrender, entered the village and confronted the other Israeli unit already present in the village. The two sides realized their mistake after a brief exchange of fire, and the latter unit was replaced by the incoming unit. The new unit ordered the residents to hand over their weapons within 30 minutes despite having already surrendered their arms a week prior. Before the deadline was reached, the commanding Israeli officer ordered the demolition of a home and gathered five residents, blindfolded them and executed them by gunfire to demonstrate their seriousness. They gathered another five residents to execute, but were stopped by a known Palestinian Arab informant from al- Damun, Shafiq Buqa'i. Buqa'i requested the Israeli officers free the residents by explaining to them the earlier agreement made between the villagers and Auerbach. During the 1948 War, the village of Sha'ab was largely depopulated and most of its residents settled in Majd al-Krum, some permanently and others temporarily.Cohen, 2010, p. 100. Many people who fled Majd al-Krum settled in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon.Peteet, 2011, pp. 113-114. A former fighter from the village, Abed Bishr, leased a small plot of land outside Beirut and founded the Shatila refugee camp and gathered other refugees from Majd al-Krum to settle there. According to historian Julie Peteet, the role of Majd al-Krum and its refugees \\"was foundational in its [the camp's] establishment.\\"Peteet, 2011, p. 114. According to Yiftachel, Majd al-Krum \\"experienced tremendous upheaval\\" during the 1948 war, with about half of its inhabitants becoming refugees in Lebanon, while becoming home to about 300 people from nearby villages. =State of Israel= Prior to the 1948 war, Majd al-Krum's land area consisted of 20,065 dunams (20.07 hectares), 69% of which was expropriated by the Israeli state between 1948 and the mid-1970s.Yiftachel 1995, p. 140. The majority of the land was expropriated on the basis of the 1949 Absentees' Property Law from refugees who fled during the war, the remainder for \\"public purposes\\" or on the basis of lacking formal title (communal land as designated by Ottoman-era land laws). Jurisdiction over expropriated lands subsequently came under the Israel Land Authority (ILA), which, because of a 1960 law prohibiting the sale of state lands, began a process of land exchange with Majd al-Krum's remaining inhabitants.Yiftachel 1995, p. 141. Accordingly, many residents of Majd al-Krum exchanged agricultural land they owned for expropriated land within the village proper, i.e. areas designated for residential use, in lieu of purchasing lands expropriated from the village. The typical exchange rate entailed the residents' transfer of five dunams of their agricultural lands for one dunam of land within the residential areas of the village, and the ILA would normally keep a 10‚Äì25% ownership stake in the residential parcel. The ILA minority ownership stake was not explicitly marked in surveys, thus guaranteeing the ILA control over the residents' right to build on their newly-acquired parcels. The process of land exchange was particularly active between 1965 and 1980, during which 15,860 dunams were transferred to the ILA in exchange for 3,010 dunams transferred to Majd al-Krum's residents.Yiftachel 1995, p. 142. Majd al-Krum was made a local council in 1963. Members of the council are elected and the council is responsible for basic municipal services, although local planning has remained in the jurisdiction of the Central Galilee Local Planning Committee appointed by the central government of Israel.Yiftachel 1998, pp. 53, 60. In 1964 about 5,100 dunams of land were expropriated by the state for the construction of the Jewish town of Karmiel, whose establishment was declared as an effort to Judaize the Galilee by Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. In 1966, efforts for a master plan began and were completed in 1978. However, the master plan was not approved by the authorities and while the population grew from 4,000 to 6,700 between 1966 and 1990, no new land was allocated to Majd al-Krum to cope with population growth.McDowall, p. 138. Beginning in the 1970s, the Jewish Agency launched efforts to build around sixty small Jewish communities, then known as mitzpim (observation points), in between Arab villages in the Galilee to monitor and check Arab building activity.Yiftachel, 1995, pp. 142‚Äì143. Among these Jewish communities were Lavon, Tuval, Gilon and Tzurit, which all border Majd al- Krum. Several hundred residents of Majd al-Krum took part in the Land Day demonstrations of 1976, which protested another round of the state's expropriation of Arab-owned land, in which 2,100 dunams from Majd al-Krum were transferred to expand Karmiel.Yiftachel, p. 152. Six Arab protesters were killed in nearby Arab towns and since then, mass expropriation of Arab-owned land by the state has virtually ended. In 1977, large anti-government demonstrations were held in Majd al-Krum and nearby villages to protest the demolition of a house in Majd al-Krum built near the road between Safed and Acre. One person was killed and several others injured as police attempted to disperse protesters. The incident prompted mayor Muhammad Manna to leave the Labor Party and join Hadash. Manna was subsequently reelected in 1986.Reiter, p. 79. Tawfiq Ziad, a member of the Knesset, declared \\"as long as there are stones in the Galilee, we shall use them to stone those who try to destroy our homes.\\"Reiter, p. 82. The protest and the response of the state led to more assertive opposition by Israel's Arab community toward state policies. In 2003 Majd al-Krum and the nearby local councils of Deir al-Asad and Bi'ina merged to form the city of Shaghur.Gutterman, Dov. Local Council of Majd el-Kurum (Israel). Flags of the World. During the 2006 Lebanon War, over 40 Katyusha rockets landed in the vicinity of Shaghur, with the nearby city of Karmiel being the apparent target.

History The school was founded in 1989 by Harry Chaucer, a former high school science teacher, based on his experiences with running the Chaucer house at the Champlain Valley Union High School in Hinesburg, Vermont. Dr. Chaucer followed the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools as he designed the curriculum, placing a special emphasis on finding original sources, using those sources to develop a thesis, and then testing that thesis.Position Statement, The Gailer School, February 9, 2001, page 3 During its first year, the Gailer School operated out of Chaucer's living room. From 1990 to 1998, it rented an unused school building in Middlebury, Vermont, from the Catholic diocese. It drew its student body primarily from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties and hosted a number of international students, primarily from Indonesia. During the 1997-1998 school year, the school had its highest enrollment, with over 80 students. In 1998, Gailer was quietly evicted from this location because the diocese wanted to restart its Catholic grammar school and needed its building back. During the summer of 1998, Gailer moved from Middlebury to Shelburne, Vermont, where it would rent a space from 1998 through 2006. At this time the Board of Trustees was controlled by parents from the greater Burlington area who did not want their own children to be inconvenienced by a long commute. Chaucer also believed at the time that replacing the less affluent Rutland County segment of the school population with more affluent students from greater Burlington would guarantee a steady source of revenue for the school. Analysis of a student and staff phone list from this time shows that approximately 1/3 of staff and students each came from Addison, Chittenden, and Rutland counties.Gailer School phone list, 1997-1998 However, a report penned by Chaucer and the Board from this time claimed that over 75% of their students were traveling from the Burlington area in 1997-98.Position Statement, The Gailer School, February 9, 2001, page 1 As a result of the move, Gailer's student and staff turnover was over 50% per year in the period between 1998 and 2000.Gailer School phone list, 1998-1999Gailer School phone list, 1999-2000 At the end of the 1999-2000 academic year, the school lost over half of its students and approximately half of its staff.Gailer School phone list, 2000-2001 In 2006, the Board of Trustees looked at student demographics, costs, and local competition from other progressive schools, and decided to move the school back to its original home in Middlebury. In the spring of 2009, the school purchased the building at 54 Creek Road in Middlebury. However, this upswing was short-lived. After several consecutive years of being unable to generate sufficient tuition revenue in a bad economy, the school ceased operations in May 2012, after 23 years. Curriculum Harry Chaucer named the school's educational program for Leonardo da Vinci. The original curriculum was history-based, beginning with the origin of the universe and extending to contemporary times.The Gailer School Planning Committee Report & Recommendations, November 12, 2001, page 8 The \\"da Vinci\\" curriculum stressed interdisciplinary learning, encouraging students to see the interconnectedness of science, history, mathematics, language and the written word. Classes included seminar-based discussions, lectures, student presentations, field work and group projects. Each student also took a weekly \\"master class\\", allowing the in-depth study of a chosen subject. Students also were required to perform community service to encourage and understand their connectedness to their community. Gailer was one of the first schools in Vermont to introduce community service into its curriculum. The school aimed to foster the development of skills necessary for students to succeed in college and the world: *Communication: written, artistic and oral communication skills essential for reasoning and expression of complex ideas. *Mathematics: fundamental knowledge and skills; ability to imagine and solve complex problems; history of mathematics. *Science: understanding the scientific process; history of science; scientific information, skills and theories. *Technological Literacy: expertise in gathering and assessing information; proficiency in common computer operations. *Cultural Fluency: understanding and appreciating a variety of cultural experiences, including geography, language, the arts, political and religious philosophies. *Learning to Learn: ability to formulate questions, see connections among academic disciplines, solve problems and engage in lifelong learning. *Ethics: sensitivity to ethical issues; understanding the importance of individual, institutional and corporate accountability; respect for self, others, the learning process and environment. *Teamwork and Leadership: comfort with team situations, group problem-solving and decision-making in both supportive and leadership roles. *Organization and Responsibility: effective organization of time and materials necessary for learning; habits of responsibility, punctuality and accountability for decisions and performance. Further curricular details and rationale can be found in the text, A Creative Approach to the Common Core Standards - the Da Vinci Curriculum (Rowman and Littlefield, 2012).

After earning his doctorate from Harvard University, where his dissertation was supervised by Talcott Parsons, he had held faculty positions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the City University of New York. He is a key figure in the establishment of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Leadership Forum and the Center for Puerto Rico Studies at the City University of New York. Early life and education Bonilla was born in New York City in 1925. His parents were both from Puerto Rico and had moved to the United States early in their lives. His mother emigrated to the United States in hopes of attending college, and his father had been a cigar maker and had served in the U.S. Cavalry. They were on the same boat going to the United States, and it was there where they met and began their courtship. Bonilla was raised around East Harlem, a neighborhood full of diversity of culture and race. He said that children were very often exposed to multiple languages at an early age and that they became bilingual to interact with people in their day-to-day lives. Bonilla spent his first years of high school attending a Franciscan high school in Illinois, where he showed academic and leadership skills. His favorite subjects were classical Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, and German. He was also elected President of his class. Bonilla then transferred to Morris High School (Bronx, New York). Career After he graduated from Morris High in 1943, he was drafted and assigned to a weapons platoon. Bonilla was taught to be a mortar gunner and was assigned to the 290th Infantry Regiment, 75th Infantry Division. =World War II service= The 290th Infantry Regiment, 75th Infantry Division was involved in the Battle of the Bulge. Bonilla served in this battle at the front of the line for nearly a month. After serving at the front lines, Bonilla sustained an injury and had to be hospitalized in France. After a brief three week hospitalization, Bonilla was reassigned to a replacement depot in France. It was there that he was invited to join the Puerto Rican National Guard near Frankfurt and assigned as the company clerk. He soon realized that the Puerto Rican soldiers had a divide. The Puerto Rican soldiers raised in the United States were looked down upon by those who had grown up in Puerto Rico, and referred to the emigrated Puerto Ricans as \\"American Joes\\". Bonilla said of this experience, \\"The military experience helped to consolidate my sense of being Puerto Rican and also a sense of wanting to study and be a scholar.\\" =Post-war career= Bonilla returned to the United States after he was discharged from the military and made use of the educational benefits of the G.I. Bill to attend the College of the City of New York. He graduated cum laude in 1949 with a B.A. in business administration. He went on to pursue a master‚Äôs degree in sociology from New York University, which he earned in 1954. He attended Harvard University and received a doctorate in sociology soon after. In 1965 his name appeared on a list of academics involved with Project Camelot.Behavioral Sciences and the National Security: Report No. 4, Together With Part IX of the Hearings on Winning the Cold War: The U.S. Ideological Offensive by the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, December 6, 1965 For 20 years, he directed CUNY's Center for Puerto Rican Studies, where he served as founding director until his retirement in 1995. He also played a key role in the formation of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Leadership Forum to help manage the needs of Puerto Ricans in New York. Bonilla also co-founded the Inter-University Program for Latino Research at the City University of New York, a consortium for research that includes over 20 universities. =Legacy= The Frank Bonilla Public Intellectual Award was created in his honor by the Latin American Studies Association (LASA). The award is offered every other year. Death He died on December 28, 2010. He is survived by two daughters, a son, and five grandchildren.

She was the daughter and the only known child of Cleomenes I, King of Sparta (r. 520‚Äì490 BC) during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. She was the wife of King Leonidas I, Cleomenes' half-brother, who fought and died in the Battle of Thermopylae. Gorgo was also the mother of King Pleistarchus, her only son with co-King Leonidas I. She is also noted as one of the few female historical figures actually named by Herodotus, and was known for her political judgment and wisdom. Her birth date is uncertain, but based on Herodotus' dating, it is most likely to have been between 518 and 508 BC (Histories 5.51). Family background Her father, Cleomenes, was the eldest-born son of the previous Agiad king, Anaxandridas II. He succeeded his father at his death; however, he had three paternal half-brothers, of whom the eldest, Dorieus, would cause him some trouble. The other two half-brothers were Leonidas I and Cleombrotus. All four were sons of Anaxandridas II, one of the dual kings of Sparta of the Agiad house. According to one version (Herodotus's Histories, 5.4), Gorgo's grandfather Anaxandridas II was long married without children and was advised to remarry (i.e. take a second wife) which he did. His second wife gave birth to the future Cleomenes I who was thus his eldest son; however, his first wife also became pregnant, and eventually had three sons, including Leonidas I, Gorgo's future husband. Other versions imply that Cleomenes was either born by the king's first marriage or by a non-marital alliance. Most historians favor Herodotus because he is the earliest source. In either case, there appears to have been some tension between the eldest son and his half-brothers. This tension was only resolved by Cleomenes' death (or murder) and accession of Leonidas I (Cleomenes' half-brother and son-in-law). Marriage and reign Looking forward to Cleomenes' death, his only surviving child Gorgo became his sole heiress. She was apparently already married by 490 to her half-uncle Leonidas I. King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo would have at least one child, a son, Pleistarchus, co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 459 BC/458 BC. Arguably, Gorgo's most significant role occurred prior to the Persian invasion of 480 BC. According to Herodotus's Histories, Demaratus, then in exile at the Persian court, sent a warning to Sparta about Xerxes's pending invasion. In order to prevent the message from being intercepted by the Persians or their vassal states, the message was written on a wooden tablet and then covered with wax. \\"The Spartans\\", presumably the ephors, Gerousia or the kings, did not know what to do with the seemingly blank wax-tablet, until Queen Gorgo advised them to clear the wax off the tablet. She is described by David Kahn in his book The Codebreakers as one of the first female cryptanalysts whose name has been recorded. According to Plutarch, before the Battle of Thermopylae, knowing that her husband's death in battle was inevitable, she asked him what to do. Leonidas replied \\"marry a good man who will treat you well, bear him children, and live a good life\\". Children She had at least one son by Leonidas I, Pleistarchus, co-King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 458 BC. Her son was a minor at his father's death, so his uncle Cleombrotus (died 480 BC) and his first cousin and heir Pausanias (r. 480‚Äì479 BC) acted as his regent. It was Pausanias who was the architect of the combined Greek victory at the Battle of Plataea (479 BC).See Herodotus The Histories Book 9 (all), and Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War I.126‚Äì139 After Pausanias fell into disfavor and was accused of plotting treason, Leonidas's son Pleistarchus ruled with the other king of Sparta, Leotychidas II (and then his grandson Archidamus) until his death 459/458 BC. Historical mentions There are sections where she is present at court or in council and gives advice to the king or the elders. Two events in Herodotus show Gorgo give council to her father Cleomenes I and the Spartans. Herodotus says that Gorgo, aged around eight years old, managed to stop her father, Cleomenes I, being bribed by Aristagoras of Miletus to help out in the Ionian Revolt. The second event that Gorgo aided Sparta was when the Spartans were sent a tablet by Demaratus, who was at the time in Susa, that was hiding a secret message. To which Herodotus says Gorgo was the only person to uncover the hidden message and instructed the Spartans to ‚Äúscrape the wax away‚Äù to find the secret message. This indicates either that Gorgo was highly thought of by Herodotus, who often left out the names of the female figures he included in his books, or that as the wife of Leonidas I, her actions and counsel were all the more noteworthy. Plutarch quotes Queen Gorgo as follows: \\"When asked by a woman from Attica, 'Why are you Spartan women the only ones who can rule men?', she said: 'Because we are also the only ones who give birth to men.'\\" Another version has this as, \\"...some foreign lady, as it would seem, told her that the women of Lacedaemon were the only women in the world who could rule men; 'With good reason,' she said, 'for we are the only women who bring forth men.'\\" (Plutarch's Lives: Lycurgus)  In popular culture  In the 1962 film The 300 Spartans, Queen Gorgo was portrayed by Greek actress and future politician Anna Synodinou. In the novel Sacred Games, by Gary Corby, Gorgo appears as a major character. The character makes a minor appearance in the 1998 comic series 300 by Frank Miller, who was heavily inspired by the aforementioned film. In the 2006 motion picture adaptation of the comic, 300, English actress Lena Headey plays Gorgo. In this version, she is more politicaly involved and has a prominent role in the events preceding and during the war with Persia. Headey reprised her role in the 2014 sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire. Helena P. Schrader has published the first book in a three-part biographical novel on Leonidas and Gorgo. The first book, Leonidas of Sparta: A Boy of the Agoge, focuses on Leonidas's boyhood in the notorious Spartan agoge, but books two and three will give prominence to Gorgo too. In the strategic video game Civilization VI, Gorgo is one of the two leaders of Greece, alongside Pericles.Official Sid Meier's youtube channel video of Gorgo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syS-SFtr-44Official Sid Meier's youtube channel video of Pericles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCTlpEM9Vw Notes References Sources *A Profile of Gorgo from a website. *Herodotus's Histories Book VII \\"Polymnia\\" where Gorgo is mentioned in Section 239 (7.239) advising the Spartan elders after Thermopylae. * For a number of essays on Leonidas and Gorgo visit Helena Schrader's website Sparta-Leonidas- Gorgo Further reading * Blundell, Sue.

The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout.  Designations  The Kinnickinnic River is officially designated as a Class I trout stream by the WI DNR, indicating it is a \\"high quality\\" trout water that has sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carrying capacity.http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/trout/streamclassification.html The Kinnickinnic is also designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) by the WI DNR both above State HWY 35, and below the Powell Falls Dam, however, the stretch of the Kinni through the City of River Falls is not included in this designation where the river is impounded into two reservoirs which do not support a fishery. This ORW designation indicates the Kinni provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities.http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/surfacewater/orwerw.html This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an ‚Äúantidegradation‚Äù policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality ‚Äì especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.  Name  The city of River Falls, Wisconsin, which was named after the historic Junction Falls waterfall on the Kinnickinnic River, is situated on the river where the main branch of the Kinnickinnic River and the South Fork of the Kinnickinnic River have their confluence. The name Kinnickinnic is a word from the Ojibwe giniginige, and refers to tobacco mixed with other plant material for smoking.  History  The first settler of European descent along the Kinnickinnic River was Judge Joel Foster. He first settled in the area over the winter of 1848-1849 in a walled-in cave overhang at the confluence of the main channel and the South Fork of the Kinnickinnic River. Foster wrote about the two Native American tribes inhabiting the region‚Äîthe Sioux and the Chippewa. He noted that both placed such value on the St. Croix River Valley that neither claimed it for themselves. Two brothers, Nathaniel N. and Oliver Stanley Powell, also claimed land in the vicinity in 1849. They built the first commercial structure in the City of River Falls in 1852 along the banks of the Kinnickinnic River. Foster built a sawmill and dam in 1854 which was later expanded to include a feed store and was located on the south bank of the Kinnickinnic River. Later that year, the firm of Crossman & Hart constructed a brickyard on the southern edge of the growing community along the Kinnickinnic. Four flour mills with dams in the Kinnickinnic River were established in the City of River Falls. The first was built in 1855 by C.B. Cox, who later built another mill known as the Prairie Mill, located on the west side of North Main Street.http://www.riverfallsjournal.com/content/beauty-kinnickinnic-beckoned- foster-found-settlement-here  Geography  The Kinnickinnic River rises from springs in St. Croix County and flows in a southwesterly direction before emptying into the St. Croix River in Kinnickinnic State Park. The Kinnickinnic is composed of two types of river. Above River Falls, the river flows slowly, with a sandy/silty bottom and a narrower bed. Below River Falls, the bed is wider and is generally composed of stone rather than sand or silt. A substantial amount of silt and sand are deposited in the delta, enough that that section of the St. Croix is known as the \\"Kinnickinnic Narrows.\\" The water is slightly colder above the City of River Falls than below by about 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The difference in water temperature is possibly due to the two hydroelectric dams remaining in the river and their impoundments, both of which are silted in to very shallow depths, allowing the river water to stagnate and warm prior to continuing downstream. Both impoundments also experience extreme eutrophication during the warm summer months leading to significant algae blooms.http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/common/opennat.asp?fileID=13552307 The differences in the stream make for differences in the fish population. The upper section of the river contains very high numbers of trout that are of smaller size. The warmer water below River Falls supports more minnow and crustacean life, which can support larger trout, though in fewer numbers. The extreme case of this is near the delta, where the water becomes even warmer, and the river supports warmer-water species such as smallmouth bass. The Kinni watershed is characterized by scenic bluff lands, rare oak savanna, original prairie, farm land, white pine forest, wooded coulees, sedge meadows, rare and endangered plant species, beautiful stands of white pines and plenty of open space and scenic vistas. Its feeder creeks are cold and clean, containing wild native brook trout, important spawning areas, wetlands, and many springs arising from under picturesque limestone outcroppings.  Dams  The River Falls Municipal Utility owns and operates the Powell and Junction Falls dams as a hydroelectric project licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under docket #P-10489. In February 2018, the River Falls city council unanimously approved a plan to decommission and remove the dams. The plan as passed has a target date of 2026 for removal of the Powell Dam, and a target date range of 2035 to 2040 for removal of the Junction Falls Dam.  Recreation  The main recreational opportunity on the upper portions of the Kinnickinnic River is trout fishing. Nearer to River Falls downtown, walking, hiking, running, mountain biking along the trails beginning in Heritage Park and continuing across the swinging bridge and connecting to extensive trails below the lower dam in River Falls is a major attraction. The City is also a Bird City and attracts a number of birders along the river. Kayaking along the lower stretches of the river has become popular, with three businesses shuttling kayakers to the launch point below the lower dam and picking them up at the takeout at the County F bridge near Kinnickinnic State Park. Local s also launch kayaks north of the City at several points and take out in Heritage Park just before the upper dam. Access is limited on the stretch of the Kinnickinnic River below the City of River Falls. Public access on the lower river is mainly gained at three spots immediately downstream from the Glen Park dam within the River Hills neighborhood, and downstream from the County Highway F bridge at Kinnickinnic State Park two miles above the mouth of the river.

The cricket club plays a large role in village community life. While the greatest moment of popular fame must be the victory in the final of the National Village Championship at Lord‚Äôs in 1985 (against a Surrey side, to give it added relish), the fact is that the standard of play, and equally importantly, of opposition, has increased steadily since that time. In the 1970s, virtually all games were friendlies against other village clubs, with the occasional friendly against one of the ‚Äúbig clubs‚Äù from Edinburgh; the club looked on these as major cricketing occasions, while the opponents thought them to be more of a social day out. Today, Freuchie Cricket Club meet these teams on a very competitive basis. Two of the present ‚Äúhome- grown‚Äù players have played for Scotland‚Äôs first team, while others have played at other representative levels. The 2006 season exemplified this rise in standards when the club began the year by winning the Media Sixes Indoor Six- a-Side tournament and went on to win the SNCL Division II championship with a game to spare. Meanwhile, the Second XI gained promotion from East League Division II, so this coming year sees the club competing in the first divisions of both the Scottish National (SNCL) and the East of Scotland (ESCA) leagues.

It was re-issued in 2004 following the popularity of the Suite Fran√ßaise notebooks discovered in 1998. David Golder was first published in France in 1929 and won instant acclaim for the 26-year-old author. Plot summary The novel opens with Golder refusing to help his colleague of many years, Marcus. As a result of this, Marcus, bankrupt, commits suicide. Following the funeral, Golder travels to Biarritz where he has a huge, opulent house. His wife and daughter reside there in luxury, spending Golder's cash like water. On the train, he suffers a heart attack. Seriously ill, he is forced to re-evaluate his life. Major themes David Golder is a self-made man. From humble beginnings as a Jew in Ukraine selling rags, he is now a cold, ruthless businessman. It is suggested by his wife, Gloria, that Marcus is not the only casualty of Golder's brutal dealings. However he has an Achilles heel, well hidden: his feckless daughter, Joyce. It is this weakness that eventually ruins him. Now 68 and dying, he realises that his wealth has not brought him happiness; simply a grim satisfaction that, as \\"a good Jew\\" he has provided for his uncaring family. Gloria and Joyce are portrayed as grasping and selfish, barely showing concern or interest in Golder except when they need more money for jewellery, furs, cars and cash for their lovers. The novel is an astonishing portrayal of a businessman and his family in the years leading up to the Great Depression. It also introduces characters of great depth, like Soifer, the old German Jew who \\"walks on tiptoe\\" to save shoe leather; he is Golder's only connection with the old world from which he himself came. His wife, Gloria, (Havke is her Yiddish name) is as beautiful, cold and hard as the jewels she so treasures. But it is Joyce, Golder's 18-year-old daughter, who is central to the story. It is she who ultimately causes his ruin. Adaptations In 1930 the novel was made into a film David Golder directed by Julien Duvivier and starring Harry Baur as the title character. In March 2010 the book was dramatised in five episodes on BBC Radio 4, with David Suchet as David Golder. It was directed by Peter Farago.

In 1964, during the period of intercommunal violence after the Bloody Christmas of 1963, the whole of the village's Turkish Cypriot population fled to Turkish Cypriot enclaves in Lefka, Angolemi, Kazivera and Elia. In 1968, some Turkish Cypriots returned to the village though their numbers were extremely small, only 23 were reported in 1971. Following the killing of two Turkish Cypriots by Greek Cypriot militants in 1974 after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the returned Turkish Cypriots also left for Northern Cyprus. There, Turkish Cypriots of Peristerona were resettled all over the territory but were mainly concentrated in Katokopia. Peristerona was used to resettle Greek Cypriot refugees, mainly from Morphou and surroundings. Turkish Cypriot houses were mostly used to house these people and a modern housing development was constructed between 1975 and 1982, housing 500 people in 1982. The church, St. Barnabas and Hilarion Church,Artist photos has five domes on the roof arranged in the shape of a cross, a feature only seen on one other church in the island.PlanetWare.com > Peristerona Tourism It was built in the Byzantine period. The Peristerona Mosque was constructed in the 19th century, during the Ottoman era. It has tinted windows and sculptured parts. It is next to the church and the two were used in stamps in the British period as a symbol of Greek-Turkish coexistence. Of note is that there are two further villages with the same name in Cyprus one in the district of Paphos and one in Famagusta.

Admissions The Academy is split over two sites, with the Upper academy located in the centre of Doncaster (in the Town Fields area) and the Lower academy in the north of Bessacarr, near the Dome. Hall Cross Academy has specialist status as a Science College. The total number of pupils who attend the Academy is over 2000. It features as an integral part of the community, providing access to facilities for many primary schools, which also form part of its large catchment area. The headteacher of the Academy is Mr Simon Swain. It is named after the Hall Cross on Hall Cross Hill, on the opposite side of the main road through Doncaster. The Library and Christchurch House The library building is the oldest building on the Town Centre site, it was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and was built in 1869. Downstairs it features a plaque which can still be seen to this day, dedicating the building to Queen Victoria. The library is a classic example of Victorian Gothic Revival, featuring a large Hammerbeam roof decorated with flowers cut into the massive oak beams which may, in fact, be stained pine. The building also features a tower at one corner. Inside, the library features two massive Gothic-style glass windows at either end, one of them being stained glass, designed and executed by former pupil C. Rupert Moore, which was unveiled in 1938 as a tribute to \\"Old Boys\\" from the school who died in World War I. The library features a large number of Victorian plaques, dedicated to past headteachers of the school, men from the school who died in both wars, and other various things. The one added most recently commemorates the visit by Prince Charles to the school in 1989. By number of books, the library is the biggest school library in Doncaster and is largely used by the 6th form. Christchurch house is the school's equivalent of a \\"6th form block\\". It is a large detached Victorian Townhouse which overlooks the local church that the house is named after. The house features a grand wooden staircase, stained glass skylights, and a statue of the Venus de Milo which originally resided in the Girls' School, built in 1918. When the school was disbanded, the statue was moved to Hall Cross Academy. Remembrance Day Remembrance Day is one of the most important days in the academic calendar. The Academy has held a ceremony every year since 1918 to remember those who attended the school and died in battle. The service begins at 9am. Speeches are made by the Head Teacher who gives thanks to those who died as a result of conflict. Two poppy wreaths are then carried down the corridor to the library by the Head Boy and Head Girl. They are then laid by the World War One and World War Two plaques respectively, while the Last Post is played on the trumpet, with the sounds carrying through to the library.

Laborers for Justice 1997-2006. also known as the Uptown Crew,United States of America vs Arthur Coffey June 2004. is a powerful crew within the Genovese crime family. In the early 1960s, Anthony Salerno became one of the most powerful capos in the family. Salerno based the crew out of the Palma Boys Social Club located 416 East 115th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the 116th Street Crew had absorbed and initiated many former members of the vicious East Harlem Purple Gang, an Italian-American murder for hire and drug trafficking gang operating in 1970s Italian Harlem and acting generally independent of the Mafia. History =The 116th Street Mob= In the early 1890s, a group of four brothers (Giuseppe Morello, and his half- brothers Nicholo, Vincenzo and Ciro Terranova) arrived in New York City from Corleone, Sicily.GangRule.com - The Morello Gang: Early Years (1900-1910) The Morello-Terranova brothers soon started taking over the growing Little Italy in East Harlem, by using the black hand technique of extorting small business and running illegal gambling operations. The group became known as the 116th Street Mob (or Morello gang). With their increasing power the Morello's sought to control Lower Manhattan's Little Italy. The Little Italy in lower Manhattan was under the control of Ignazio \\"Lupo the Wolf\\" Saietta,Herbert Asbury. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld. Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. Before a gang war erupted, the two sides decided on joining forces. Giuseppe Morello became the Capo di tutti capi (or boss of bosses), but before long he and Ignazio Saietta were arrested and charged with counterfeiting in 1910.David Critchley. The Origin of Organized Crime: The New York City Mafia, 1891-931. New York, Routledge, 2008.Mike Dash. The First Family: Terror, Extortion and the Birth of the American Mafia. London, Simon & Schuster, 2009. Nicholo Morello took over and became embroiled in the Mafia-Camorra War.GangRule.com - The Struggle for Control 1910‚Äì1918. This conflict was between the Sicilian Morello-Terranova family and Brooklyn Camorra gangs led by Pellegrino Morano. Each side wanted to completely control all the Italian gangs in New York City and across the United States. On September 7, 1916 Nicholas Terranova was murdered, giving the Camorra gangs the advantage. The next leaders of the Morello family were brothers Vincenzo and Ciro. They continued the war and within months police began arresting top members of the Camorra gangs. This allowed the Sicilians to maintain dominance and control over New York City and the remaining Camorra gangs joined forces with Sicilian gangs. Vincent continued operating from Brooklyn, and Ciro continued expanding his operations in East Harlem and The Bronx. =The Artichoke King= Ciro \\"The Artichoke King\\" Terranova controlled the 116th Street Crew during the prohibition era. In his later years, after being \\"encouraged\\" by younger gangsters to retire in 1935 and subsequently declaring bankruptcy and losing his Pelham Manor home to foreclosure, Terranova and his wife moved into the building long owned by the Morello-Terranova family at 338 East 116th Street (the headquarters of the Ignatz Florio Co-operative Association). =Coppola's policy racket= Michael \\"Trigger Mike\\" Coppola, was a top lieutenant in the 116th Street Crew of Ciro Terranova. He took over the crew sometime between 1932 and 1936, after Terranova was \\"put on the shelf\\" (i.e. forced into retirement) by the new Luciano-Genovese-Costello regime of the Luciano crime family. Coppola was also supervising the illegal numbers racket that was once controlled by Dutch Schultz before his murder. The numbers racket controlled bookmaking and illegal gambling throughout Harlem and The South Bronx, making thousands of dollars a year. When boss Vito Genovese was imprisoned in the late 1950s, various influential members began running the crime family through a ruling panel/committee. The panel consisted of acting/front boss Thomas \\"Tommy Ryan\\" Eboli, underboss Gerardo \\"Gerry\\" Catena and consigliere Michele \\"Big Mike\\" Miranda, while others served in the advisory capacity. Mike Coppola, an influential capo, also helped the panel. In the early 1960s, Mike Coppola was imprisoned on tax evasion charges and followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Ciro Terranova, being put on the shelf after his release from prison in 1963. Coppola later moved to South Florida and effectively retired. His crew, with his vast illegal interests went to Anthony Salerno. =Palma Boys crew= Anthony Salerno Anthony \\"Fat Tony\\" Salerno, started as a soldier in the 1930s under capo, Michael Coppola. As years went by, Salerno worked his way up the ranks of the crew and the crime family, controlling his own lucrative gambling and loansharking operations. In the early 1960s, his capo Coppola was imprisoned on tax evasion charges and demoted in rank. The crew then split, allowing Coppola's top lieutenants to break up his vast illegal interests that included his numbers empire. Salerno based the 116th Street Crew from the Palma Boys Social Club located at 416 East 115th Street in East Harlem. Salerno, and his brother Cirino (known as \\"Charles\\" or \\"Charlie Speed\\") led the crew, operating in Italian Harlem and the Bronx. The Salerno brothers oversaw a multimillion-dollar gambling racket based in East Harlem that expanded into the South Bronx. Salerno's gambling empire included numbers, bookmaking and floating dice games. Even when the East Harlem neighborhood went from a predominantly Italian to a predominantly black neighborhood, Salerno managed to hold onto their interests and employ over 200 people in their street rackets. Salerno was a highly respected and feared gangster, and a well-known New York Mafia powerhouse who continued to rise through the ranks of the Genovese crime family becoming consigliere from 1972‚Äì75, underboss in 1975, and eventually the acting‚Äìfront boss from 1981-86. In the late 1970s, the FBI managed to place a listening device in his East Harlem headquarters, the Palma Boys Social Club. By the early 1980s, Salerno had been caught on the bug discussing crime family affairs and business with various members, including top underlings such as capo Matthew \\"Matty the Horse\\" Ianniello, Salerno driver and right-hand-man Vincent \\"Fish\\" Cafaro, and even Lucchese crime family boss Anthony \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo, whose own Jaguar, where Corallo conducted much of his affairs had also been bugged. In February 1985, the information obtained through the FBI bug was used to eventually indict Salerno and the bosses of New York's Five Families, who sat on The Commission. The Mafia Commission Trial began in September 1986 and ended in November. Tony Salerno, along with five other New York bosses were convicted under the RICO statute and sentenced to 100 years in prison in January 1987. =Bellomo era= Liborio \\"Barney\\" Bellomo took over the crew in the early 1980s, operating in Harlem and the Bronx. In the early 1990s, Bellomo was promoted to street boss for imprisoned boss Vincent \\"The Chin\\" Gigante. On July 27, 1992, former capo Anthony Salerno died in prison. Bellomo was imprisoned, and various acting leaders such as Frank \\"Farby\\" Serpico and Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Muscarella controlled the crew.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from to , most notably for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Baseball career Born in Smyrna, Tennessee, Gooch began his professional baseball career in 1916 at the age of 18 with the Talladega Tigers of the Georgia‚ÄìAlabama League. He didn't play professionally in 1917 or 1918 as he returned to help on the family farm after his oldest brother had died in a drowning accident and his second oldest brother had been called into military service during World War I. Gooch was also called into military service and was aboard a train heading to the service when news of the Armistice broke. In 1918, Gooch tried out to play for the New Orleans Pelicans but didn't make the team. Despite this setback, the eager Gooch continued to show up for the team's practices. His eagerness to play finally convinced the Pelicans to sign him to a contract. He was sent to play in Cleveland and then to Mobile, where he was released. The Birmingham Barons then signed him after The Barons‚Äô manager, Carlton Molesworth, remembered his dedication during one of his team's visits to play in Mobile. It was in Birmingham where Gooch first played with future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Pie Traynor, and the two men developed a lifelong friendship. In 1920, he posted a .288 batting average in 136 games for the Barons. Gooch made his major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 9, 1921 at the age of 22. Gooch had his best season offensively in 1922 when veteran catcher Walter Schmidt, held out for more pay and didn't play until August. He posted a career-high .329 batting average in 105 games, and collected an extra-inning six-hit game, two four-hit games, and eight three-hit games. He also had 102 assists defensively, third best in the league. In 1925, he played as a backup catcher to Earl Smith while posting a .298 batting average along with 30 runs batted in to help the Pirates win the National League pennant. The Pirates then went on to defeat the Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series. He appeared in three games of series and went hitless in 3 at bats. Gooch played in 101 games in 1927 and had a career-high 48 runs batted in, as the Pirates once again won the National League championship. However, they faced the powerful New York Yankees led by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the 1927 World Series and were defeated in four straight games. In 1928, the Pirates acquired future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Burleigh Grimes, who was the last pitcher allowed to throw the spitball in the major leagues. Pirates manager, Donie Bush chose Gooch to be Grimes' personal catcher, due to his previous experience at catching the tricky spitball. After spending six and a half years with the Pirates, Gooch was traded in June 1928 along with Joe Harris to the Brooklyn Robins in exchange for Charlie Hargreaves, as the Pirates were seeking a right-handed batter. It was also reported that he had fallen out of favor with the Pirates because of a salary dispute during the off-season. News reports surfaced in January 1929 that Gooch wasn't happy in Brooklyn after having spent so many years in Pittsburgh, and was contemplating retirement. That April, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Val Picinich. He experienced a rejuvenation by hitting for a .300 batting average in 92 games for the seventh-place Reds. After one more season with the Reds where his batting average dropped to .243, he was traded to the Nashville Volunteers in the Southern Association for Joe Cicero. He posted a .334 batting average in 117 games during the Volunteers' 1932 season. In January 1933, he returned to the major leagues when his contract was bought by the Boston Red Sox. Gooch's playing time was diminished when the Red Sox acquired catcher Rick Ferrell in May. He appeared in 37 games for the Red Sox and played in his final major league game on September 12, 1933 at the age of 37. Career statistics In an eleven-year major league career, Gooch played in 805 games, accumulating 662 hits in 2,363 at-bats for a .280 career batting average along with 7 home runs, 293 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .342. He had a career fielding percentage of .973. Managerial and coaching career Gooch was hired by the Cincinnati Reds to be a player-manager for the Durham Bulls of the Piedmont League in December 1935. He was credited with helping young pitcher Johnny Vander Meer cure the wildness of his pitching. Vander Meer went on to become the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to pitch two consecutive no hitters. Gooch was then hired as the manager for the Mount Airy Reds of the Bi-State League. In January 1937, the Pirates hired Gooch to be their pitching coach, at the urging of his old friend, Pie Traynor, who was then managing the Pirates. In October 1939, the Pirates released him as a coach, then immediately rehired him as a scout. The Pirates then named him to be the manager for their minor league affiliate, the Hutchinson Pirates of the Western Association for the 1941 season. His final year in baseball was 1942, as a player-manager for the Bluefield Blue-Grays in the Mountain State League. Later life After retiring from baseball management, Gooch opened a baseball bat factory in Nashville. In 1972, Gooch was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Gooch died on May 15, 1975 in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 77.

As one of the first board wargames (and the first one about the Eastern Front of World War II) it was extensively played and discussed during the early years of the wargaming hobby. Description Despite its title, Stalingrad covers the entire campaign between Germany and the Soviet Union from June 1941 to May 1943. Often criticized for lack of realism, Stalingrad is the granddaddy of the many eastern front games that have since been published. Germany wins the game by occupying the cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad and holding them for two turns simultaneously or eliminating all opposing units. The Soviets win by avoiding the German victory conditions or eliminating all German units. The game is played on a 22x28 inch mounted hex grid map of the eastern front with a scale of about 30 miles per hex. Cardboard counters represent military units (generally army corps); each game turn represents one month. Key terrain features include major cities, rivers, rough terrain and swamps. Defenders can gain advantages in battle by occupying cities, rough terrain and defending behind rivers. Variable weather effects in fall, winter and spring months affect the movement rate of combat units. Except for some Italian and Hungarian units, there are no reinforcements in the game. The armed forces of both sides are replenished by replacements. Replacements are eliminated units, which are returned to the game. The production capability of the Soviets is reflected in the replacement rate, which rises during the game. The sequence of play and combat resolution in Stalingrad are similar to other Avalon Hill games published in the 1960s, including Afrika Korps and D-Day. In each turn, a player moves his forces, and then executes attacks. In some situations, the attacker may advance a hex after combat. The combat results table of Stalingrad is identical to the other two games. Players of Stalingrad are encouraged to use ‚Äúsoak-off‚Äù attacks, which give the attacker a good chance of eliminating an enemy unit, in return for the likely sacrifice of a friendly unit. There are several criticisms of the game. Although the game is very competitive, it is not a good simulation of the campaign. The exploitation of breakthroughs by mechanized forces is absent as the opponent moves directly after combat, allowing him a chance to plug any holes in the line, and pull units out of threatened positions. A component of blitzkrieg warfare, tactical air power, is missing from the game. The time frame of Stalingrad covers parts of three years. During that time, the organization and order of battle of both armies changed significantly, but the game does not reflect any changes. In the numerous eastern front games that have followed after Stalingrad, game designers have addressed these and other issues of realism and playability. Reception Lewis Pulsipher comments: \\"While the company name lives on as an imprint at Hasbro, Avalon Hill's legacy is more substantial. It provided the foundation for the entire hobby gaming industry, and of Avalon Hill's many groundbreaking early titles, Stalingrad is the best.\\" References External links * Category:American board games Category:Avalon Hill games Category:Board games introduced in 1963 Category:World War II board wargames ","title":"Stalingrad (wargame)"},{"id":"9917851","text":"The 53rd Street Crosstown Line was a surface transit line in Manhattan, New York City, United States, running along 53rd Street in Midtown, between Sixth Avenue and Ninth Avenue. It served as a connection between north-south lines during the times that they were not affiliated with the 59th Street Crosstown Line. The street is no longer used by buses, which now use 59th Street to make the crosstown connection. History The tracks in 53rd Street were added in 1894, when the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, a cable car line, opened. However, the Metropolitan had a lease on the Central Park, North and East River Railroad, the owner of the 59th Street Crosstown Line, and used 59th Street as a connection in the Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line.Stuart Charles Wade, A Birds-eye View of Greater New York and Its Most Magnificent Store, 1898 After the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line was converted to electricity in 1901, those cars were also moved to 59th Street, and a new service - the 53rd Street Line - was added. The route began at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street and traveled north on Sixth Avenue for three blocks, west on 53rd Street to Ninth Avenue, and north on Ninth Avenue to 54th Street.Carl-Axel Rheborg, Pocket Guide to New York, 1906 Effective August 6, 1908, the CPN&ER; was separated from the bankrupt Metropolitan, and three lines - the Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue Line, Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, and Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line - were placed on 53rd.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac, 1916 The Ninth Avenue Railroad, which owned the trackage on 53rd Street between Seventh and Ninth Avenues,Harry James Carman, The Street Surface Railway Franchises of New York City, 1919 was split from New York Railways, the Metropolitan's successor, in 1919. The Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue Line and Sixth and Amsterdam Avenues Line were discontinued, while the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line remained, using trackage rights over the Ninth Avenue's trackage on 53rd Street and Ninth Avenue south of Broadway to reach Columbus Avenue. The Ninth Avenue Railroad brought back the old 53rd Street shuttle to Sixth Avenue. On February 12, 1936, New York City Omnibus Corporation buses replaced the trolleys on the Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line, ending use of the 53rd Street tracks. The replacement bus - now the M7 - used 54th Street eastbound and 55th Street westbound until after the 59th Street Crosstown Line was replaced by buses.

It is located 45 kilometers north from Sofia and is part of the Svoge municipality. According to the 2011 census 114 people live in the settlement. Several places of interest are located nearby including the Seven Altars monastery, Izdremets peak and a section of the Kom‚ÄìEmine long-distance footpath.  Etymology  One of the theories is that the name of the village comes from the specific stones - liska () - which could only be found in this area. This local stone was used as a foundation material for the local houses. The other theory is that Leskov comes from the Bulgarian word leska () which means hazel tree. The Bulgarian word dol is translated in English as small valley. There are two ways of writing the village's name - Leskov dol or Leskovdol, although nowadays many people have adopted the merged version. Also on most of the maps and in official documents the name is written Leskovdol.http://www.nsi.bg/nrnm/show2.php?sid=57572&ezik;=bul&e;=8093  History  It is believed that the village was founded somewhere between the years 1000 and 1300. The legend about the founding of the nearby monastery states that 7 brothers from Bessarabia settled in the mountains around the monastery and brought their families with them. One of the brothers settled in the lands of Leskovdol with his family and thus founded the village. This is just a legend http://www.pravoslavieto.com/manastiri/sedemte_prestola/index.htm History of the Seven Altars monastery & of the villages around it (in Bulgarian) but so far no evidence about the village's history have been found. =Berilova vodenitsa fortress= Memorial plaque Historians confirm http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/giliev/bov/bov_1_2.htm Historical data of the region around Svoge (in Bulgarian) that around the time of khan Krum on the northern hills above the village was located a fortress called Berilova vodenitsa. It is not known when exactly the fortress was built but it is known that it was renovated during the time of khan Krum for his march to conquer Serdica. Today on the meadows above Leskovdol, near Izdremets peak, one can see numerous scattered stones and rocks. An ancient Roman road from Vratsa to Serdica also passed nearby. =Wars between 1912 - 1918= 20 people from Leskovdol perished in the wars that took place between 1912 and 1918. Their names are inscribed into a memorial plaque on one of the walls of the village church. =Area= The entire territory of Leskovdol - with all of its hamlets, forests and meadows - is a little over 26,2 square kilometers.  Nature and landscape  Redinska river The landscape is steep, typical for the Western Balkan mountain region. Leskovdol is situated from 700 to 1300 meters above sea level with Vratnitsa being the highest located hamlet at around 1300 meters. Dirt roads link Leskovdol with its neighbouring villages of Bukovets, Brezovdol, Redina (to the south), ≈Ωelen (to the west) & Bov (to the north). Wide mountain meadows make up to 39,8% of Leskovdol's territory and are mainly located in the higher parts of the village.http://www.svoge.bg/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/Obshtinski_plan_za_razvitie_na_obshtina_Svoge_2014-2020.pdf Data from the Svoge Agricultur–µ Department, February 2014, page 30 (in Bulgarian) Redinska is the main river which flows through the territory of the Leskovdol. =Flora & fauna= Forests cover a large percentage of the territory - around 55%.http://www.svoge.bg/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/Obshtinski_plan_za_razvitie_na_obshtina_Svoge_2014-2020.pdf Data from the Svoge Agricultur–µ Department, February 2014, page 30 (in Bulgarian) The conifers are mainly pines, spruces and firs, while the broad- leaved trees are well represented by multiple species including birches, fraxinus, tilias, fruit trees, hornbeams, walnut trees and beeches. The fauna in this region is typical for the Western Balkan mountain area. Wolves, wild rabbits, wild boars and hedgehogs inhabit the higher territories and the abandoned hamlets of the village which are not influenced by human activity. Domestic animals such as sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, cattle, cows and donkeys can be seen in the populated hamlets. A small part of Leskovdol's territory is under the protection of Natura 2000. Map of the protected territories in Bulgaria under Natura 2000  Division  The village is divided into a number of hamlets, although the largest portion of the population is concentrated in the hamlets Selishte, Popov kladenets, Vratnitsa, Kokeleni babki, Svinove and Dobrolevo bardo. Lozeto () bus stop on the bus route Svoge - Leskovdol marks the border between the territory of Leskovdol village and that of its neighbouring Redina village.http://wikimapia.org/#lat=42.964229&lon;=23.4030649&z;=19&l;=11&m;=b Lozeto bus stop marking the border between Redina & Leskovdol  Education  The Hristo Botev elementary school There is a single school named after Hristo Botev which shut down years ago. The local children go to the nearby town of Svoge to continue their education. The first village school was built on the banks of Redinska river but was destroyed in the 1940s. Soon after the existing school was founded in Selishte hamlet. = Culture = Nowadays the village has no functioning schools or chitalishta. Years ago Leskovdol had a folklore ensemble which performed national dances & songs from Bulgaria and from the Svoge region. The traditions in the village are close to the ones typical for the Svoge and Sofia regions.  Demographics  At the beginning of the 20th century the population was at least 800 people and continued to enlarge.http://www.nsi.bg/nrnm/show9.php?sid=2754&ezik;=bul Data by the National Statistical Institute The migration towards the cities and the lowering fertility rate are the biggest problems that kept Leskovdol from growing. The unemployment is high due to the location of the village in a mountainous region. In summer a lot of people, mainly from Sofia, come to their villas for the typical summer break. =2011 census= Radova livada hamlet According to the census held on the 01.02.2011 114 people declared to live in the village. Official data from the census Only 36 from them are officially retired. =Buildings= Houses, residential and non-residential buildings cover only around 5% of the entire village territory.http://www.svoge.bg/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/Obshtinski_plan_za_razvitie_na_obshtina_Svoge_2014-2020.pdf Data from the Svoge Agricultur–µ Department, February 2014, page 30 (in Bulgarian) Most of the old houses in the village were built using adobe, rocks and wood. In the late 1960s people, mainly from Sofia, bought parcels in the village's hamlets and started building a second type of houses - villas and bungalows - which they used as a residence for their summer vacations. The villas are built with modern building materials and thus create a mixed look of the village with both typical and new houses forming the background. According to the 2001 census there were 128 local houses, 26 of which abandoned, and 619 other buildings, including villas & barns.  Economy  Woodcutters can sometimes be seen in this area, especially during late summer. Agriculture and animal breeding are developed in the populated areas. There is a small bar and a shop next to the village hall. They are open every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  Religion  The church of Saint Elias The entire population consists of Christians. There are three cemeteries - one nearby the village hall, one in Dabeto hamlet and another one in Selishte hamlet, where the village's church is also located. It has an outdoor semantron and was built during the period between the two world wars. It bears the name of Saint Elias. There are no serving priests since the 1970s.  Transport  The road to Leskovdol diverts from the main road Sofia - Mezdra just before entering Svoge. It is 8 kilometers long and is mostly in good condition but only reaches the center of Kokeleni babki hamlet. Apart from that all others roads in the village are dirt roads. There are two charter buses to the village from Svoge every day - one in the morning and another in the afternoon. On Thursday there is an additional bus around noon.http://svoge.eu/viewpage.php?page_id=9 (in Bulgarian)  Infrastructure  Almost all of the houses have electricity and water supply. There are no telephone lines except a telephone post in the village hall. The postal code is 2268 although the post is delivered only to the village hall. The TV and radio tower is located in Popov kladenets hamlet. All three Bulgarian mobile operators have complete coverage in Leskovdol. The village hall shut down in the summer of 1999 due to the continuing diminution of the population.http://www.nsi.bg/nrnm/show2.php?sid=20002473&ezik;=bul&e;=20011938 (in Bulgarian)  Gallery  File:Leskovdol-view.jpgLeskovdol viewed from Visokata chukla peak File:Old-barn-leskovdol.jpgAn old barn build from timber, leska' stones' & adobe File:Leskovdol-bus.jpgBuses to Leskovdol at the Svoge bus station File:White-adobe-house.jpgAbandoned adobe house File:Leskovdol-sunset-view.jpgView over the village from Vratnitsa hamlet  External links  References ;Notes Category:Villages in Sofia Province ","title":"Leskovdol"},{"id":"9917911","title":"List of United States senators in the 86th Congress by seniority"},{"id":"9917939","text":"Eliran Elkayam (; born October 30, 1976) is an Israeli football player.

Its area, after April 1, 1938, was 31 656 km¬≤ (see: Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on April 1, 1938). The landscape was flat. Forests covered only 11.4% of the area, compared to the national average of 22.2%, as of January 1, 1937. Population According to the 1931 Polish census, the population was 2 460 900. Poles made up 88.3% of population, Jews - 9.7% and Germans - 1.6%. The Jews and the Germans preferred to live in the cities and towns, especially in Warsaw itself. In Warsaw, in 1931, only 70.7% of population was Polish, with 28.3% Jews. In the whole Voivodeship, 21.8% of the population was illiterate as of 1931. Industry The Voivodeship's biggest industrial center was the city of Warsaw, together with towns in its suburbs (≈ªyrard√≥w, Pruszk√≥w, Piaseczno). Warsaw was one of key centers of Polish industry, with numerous factories of various kinds. It was also the biggest city of the country. The Voivodeship's railroad density was 5.2 km. per 100 km¬≤ (with total length of railroads 1 548 km.)l Cities and administrative divisions Warsaw Voivodeship in mid-1939 consisted of 22 powiats (counties), 53 cities and towns and 293 villages.

Despite its common name, it is not closely related to the true honeysuckle. Description An erect, scrambling shrub, it grows to in height and a similar width. Normally evergreen, it may lose its leaves in colder climates. In certain habitats it may scramble, meaning that it shoots out long growth tips which lean on the stems and branches of other plants, as well as boulders, trellises, fences and walls; this can lead to the plant appearing untidy. The leaves are up to long. They are opposite, slightly serrated, green to dark-green, and pinnate with 5 to 9 oblong leaflets. The flowers are tubular, narrow, about long, and are produced at different times throughout the year. They are grouped in long terminal clusters. The flower colour ranges from orange to orange-red to apricot. Distribution The species occurs naturally in South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique. It is cultivated in other areas of the world, such as in South-east Asia, Hawaii and California. It can be considered invasive in remote islands such as the Azores (as seen at the island of S√£o Miguel, near Ponta Gar√ßa). Cultivation Tecoma capensis has been in cultivation for many years and is often used for hedging, as it is a scrambling shrub. It can be propagated from cuttings or by removing rooted suckers during the active growth phase. It can be planted in semi-shade to full sun. Tolerating temperatures down to , it can be grown in mild temperate areas with the protection of a warm wall. Otherwise it can be grown in a container and taken indoors through the winter months. To keep this shrub clean and tidy, it must be pruned back in late winter to promote new growth and flowers. The application of a balanced fertilizer after pruning will enhance the growth and flowering. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Ecology Tecoma capensis is an excellent plant to use in a wildlife garden in Southern Africa, since it is popular with sunbirds and certain insects due to its nectar. As a scrambler, it can be quite dense (if pruned) and as such can be utilised as a nesting site by a few bird species. The larvae of the death's head hawkmoth (Acherontia atropos) and the fulvous hawkmoth (Coelonia mauritii) eat the leaves of this plant.

Buckie High School on Scottish Schools Online The school serves the coastal communities of Portgordon, Buckie, Portessie, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen. History =Rathven School Board= There has been a secondary school in Buckie since 1875.William Barclay, The schools and schoolmasters of Banffshire, Educational Institute of Scotland, Banff, 1925 The opening followed the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, which made education compulsory between the ages of 5 and 13 and put education in the charge of 895 school boards. Rathven School Board covered the Buckie area and built Buckie Public School in West Church Street, at its junction with Pringle Street. The first entry in the school's log book on 14 January 1876 records that there were 100 pupils enrolled in the charge of a rector, and two pupil teachers. The curriculum consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar and composition, history, geography, singing and religious knowledge, with Latin for some pupils. The Latin in the school motto translates as 'with oars and sails' - and suggests doing things with all the effort and power one can muster. School Board records show that by 1881 mathematics and domestic economy had been added to the curriculum and the roll had risen to 400, with a rector, two assistant teachers and six pupil teachers. In 1896, the school had nineteen staff and 850 pupils. The curriculum had been widened and now included Greek, French, cookery, industrial work, drawing, military drill, German, science and shorthand. The first mention of national examinations was in 1894 when the school log in June noted that \\"the Leaving Certificate Examinations interfered with work\\", but in 1895 the Inspectors' report noted with commendation, \\"there were gained 53 Leaving Certificates ‚Äì 18 at the Higher Grade.\\" For many years after 1876, school attendance followed a seasonal pattern depending on the herring fishing. At this time many families travelled with the fishing fleet as they followed the herring around the coast of Britain. In September 1880, for example, the school opened with 83 in attendance. In the next two weeks attendance rose to 183 and then 255, but by July it had dropped to 65. School log books refer to the herring fishing, lifting potatoes, pupils \\"jooking\\" and the problem of pupils \\"forgetting what they have been taught\\". =Banffshire County Council= In 1919, control of the school moved to the newly formed Banffshire County Council.James Scotland, The History of Scottish Education, Vol 2, London University Press, 1969 By this time there had been several extensions to the original Buckie Public School building and the pupil roll was well over 1,000. The school log notes the existence of a \\"Supplementary Course\\" for pupils who did not wish to pursue academic studies and also that pupils were achieving success in the Aberdeen University Bursary Competition. The Bursary Competition was the yardstick of success at this time. Navigation was introduced to the curriculum as it was becoming important for Board of Trade examinations. By 1921, the old school building was inadequate and it was decided to build a new secondary school, at a cost of ¬£30,000, on its present site in West Cathcart Street. It was opened in 1927, by which time there was a staff of 36 (including seven principal teachers) and sport and music began to play an important part in the life of the school. This new stone-built building, now known as the Old Building, is still in use today and houses four subject departments. All primary classes, technical education and cookery remained in the original Buckie Public School building in West Church Street. In 1937, it was decided to build a new building for the primary department for Buckie Public School immediately opposite the secondary department in West Cathcart Street. The building was, however, too small even before it opened, so classes continued to use the original building in West Church Street into the 1960s. The Banffshire Education Committee decided to make the primary department a separate school in 1969. It was known as Buckie Primary School for a decade until it was renamed Cluny Primary School. After the Second World War, the welfare state provision led to the opening of canteen facilities, provision of free books and travel when required, and to the provision of courses which, in the catchphrase of the day, \\"were suitable to the age, aptitude and ability of the pupil\\". Ordinary and Higher Grade exams were introduced after 1962. The raising of the school leaving age to 16 in 1972-73, and the introduction of comprehensive education, led to an urgent need to expand what was by now known as Buckie High School.\\"SCOTLAND (SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAMME)\\", Hansard, 26 November 1969, (HC Deb 26 November 1969 vol 792 cc573-84) Banffshire Education Committee planned to build a new block at Buckie High School and to close the junior secondary schools in Portgordon, Buckpool (St.Peter's), Portessie, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen. =Grampian Regional Council= Regionalisation transferred the school to Grampian Region in 1975. Buckie High School's \\"New Building\\" was completed in 1974, allowing it to cater for all secondary age pupils in the coastal area between Cullen and Portgordon. It was now a comprehensive school aiming to meet the needs of all pupils in the west of Banffshire. The old building in West Cathcart Street continued to be used to house the Music Department until around 1983 before its sale and conversion into flats known as Pringle Court. The adjacent School Cottage in Pringle Street, which had in past years housed the school caretaker and compulsory officer was sold in the mid 1990s Parish: Census of Scotland 1901 Rathven; ED: 5; Page: 40; Line: 18; Roll: CSSCT1901_116327 The school became fully inclusive when Clochan Special School was integrated into the High School in 1986. Grampian identified Buckie High School as one of its six \\"social priority\\" schools following the downturn in fishing and related industries. The new Standard Grade exams were phased in during the late 1980s and Buckie High became a front runner in developing the curriculum for these new courses. A new reception and community wing was added in 1990 and the school became known locally as Buckie Community High School. Buckie High School =Moray Council= Buckie High School was transferred to Moray Council in 1996 and is now one of eight secondary schools in the Moray area. Its associated primary schools are Portgordon Primary School, St Peter's Primary School, Cluny Primary School, Millbank Primary School, Portessie Primary School, Findochty Primary School, Portknockie Primary School and Cullen Primary School. Learning and achievement Examination results are broadly in line with those of young people with similar needs and backgrounds in other schools.Report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIe),13 January 2009 HMIe report that in addition to Scottish Qualifications Authority examinations, large numbers of young people are participating in a range of activities which develop skills and confidence. These include a wide range of sports,\\"Surfing offered as school sport\\", BBC News, 29 June 2007 music\\"Kerry follows in famous footsteps\\" , Northern Scot, 2008 and theatrical productions as well as regular residential and overseas visits, college courses, enterprise activitiesJean McLeish, \\"Winning ways with technology\\" , TESS, 21 March 2008 and Times Educational Supplement, 28 July 2008 and an annual activities week. Young people's skills are recognised through a range of awards including awards from the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network (ASDAN), Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme, Sports Leadership awards, Youth Achievement awards, John Muir Awards and Dynamic Youth Awards. Football Buckie is proud of its football teams, especially the senior team. The team won back-to-back League and League Cup titles in the 2011/12 and the 2012/13 seasons. In 2013/14, the team once again reached the League Cup final but was defeated, which cost them the league also. However, the team won the North of Scotland Cup when they beat a Stornaway side 3-1. This was the first time Buckie High had won the trophy since 1960, when they beat Dornoch Academy 5-3 under lights at Telford Street Park in Inverness. Curriculum =Courses= School inspectors report that the school provides a very good range of courses and activities to motivate young people and to meet their needs in innovative ways.HMIe report 2009 As well as the full range of school-based Scottish Qualifications Authority courses, vocational courses at Moray College\\"Buckie pupils at Moray College\\" , Aspire North and Banff and Buchan College are widely used to complement the in-school curriculum. In addition, some pupils each year work towards a vocationally orientated Scottish Group Award. In 2006, pupils on this course teamed up with Springfield Properties, an Elgin-based building company, to build their own house in the school grounds.Jean McLeish, \\"This is the house that Scott built with Willie, Shauni, Chloe\\" , TESS, 30 June 2006, and Times Educational Supplement, 12 May 2008 Buckie High School also enriches the curriculum with a wide range of enterprise and citizenship activities including young enterprise companies, fair trade and Africa weeks, and enterprise challenges.

Innovative strategies have been used to help older pupils support younger ones in their learning.\\"Reciprocal teaching\\" , Learning & teaching Scotland Based on the notion that the best way to learn something is to teach it, cross-age tutoring has been used to teach pupils specific skills.\\"Forward thinking helps to retrain pupils\\", The Scotsman, 1 June 2005 Fourth year maths classes have, for example, paired up with a second year class for pupils to teach fractions. Fifth and sixth year students have paired up with younger students to learn about HIV. This cross-age tutoring in relation to HIV has also involved teachers and pupils from Buckie High School's partner school in Tanzania. In 2007-2008, music, drama and art were used to inspire better performance in mathematics.\\"It's maths, and all that jazz\\" , TESS, 23 May 2008 The Scottish Arts Council provided funding to allow artists to work alongside mathematics teachers in classrooms. Finding new ways to help pupils understand key concepts such as volume continues to be central to Scotland's emerging Curriculum for Excellence. Buildings The main school building is separated into three sections - the old building, the \\"new\\" building and the new performing arts facility, opened in 2010. The old building has two floors, the ground floor consisting of the English department and some of the modern languages department. Upstairs is mainly mathematics, with two modern languages classrooms. In the \\"new\\" building, there are some recreational areas on the ground floor which include reception, the snack bar, and the social area with vending machines. There are also the medical room, senior leadership team offices and the janitors' office. There are classrooms for P.E. (connected to the swimming pool), business education, art and design, computing/ICT and \\"Successmaker\\". On the second floor, there are home economics, the library, the prefects' common room, history, the staff room and another business education classroom. On the top floor are biology, physics, chemistry, geography and the technicians' base. The new extension consists of two RME classrooms, three music classrooms, a suite of music practice rooms and a state-of-the-art performance space, with bleacher seating for 240 people. There is also a technical block which consists of woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing rooms.

The hypothesis was intended to explain the constant (age independent) extinction probability as observed in the paleontological record caused by co- evolution between competing species; however, it has also been suggested that the Red Queen hypothesis explains the advantage of sexual reproduction (as opposed to asexual reproduction) at the level of individuals,Bell, G. (1982). The Masterpiece Of Nature: The Evolution and Genetics of Sexuality. University of California Press, Berkeley, 378 pp. and the positive correlation between speciation and extinction rates in most higher taxa.  Origin  leftLeigh Van Valen proposed the hypothesis as an \\"explanatory tangent\\" to explain the \\"Law of Extinction\\" (known as Van Valen's law), which states that the probability of extinction does not depend on the lifetime of the species (or higher-rank taxon), instead being constant over millions of years for any given taxon. However, the probability of extinction is strongly related to adaptive zones, because different taxa have different probabilities of extinction. In other words, extinction occurs randomly with respect to age but nonrandomly with respect to ecology. Collectively, these two observations suggest that the effective environment of any homogeneous group of organisms deteriorates at a stochastically constant rate. Van Valen proposed that this is the result of an evolutionary zero-sum game driven by interspecific competition: the evolutionary progress (= increase in fitness) of one species deteriorates the fitness of coexisting species, but because coexisting species evolve as well, no one species gains a long-term increase in fitness, and the overall fitness of the system remains constant. The phenomenon's name is derived from a statement that the Red Queen made to Alice in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass in her explanation of the nature of Looking-Glass Land: Van Valen coined the hypothesis \\"Red Queen\\" because under this interpretation, species have to \\"run\\" or evolve in order to stay in the same place, or else go extinct.  Examples  = Positive correlation between speciation and extinction rates (Stanley's rule) = The \\"law of extinction\\": The linear relationship between survival times and the logarithm of the number of genera suggests that the probability of extinction is constant over time. Redrawn from Leigh Van Valen (1973).Palaeontological data suggest that high speciation rates correlate with high extinction rates in almost all major taxa. This correlation has been attributed to a number of ecological factors, but it may result also from a Red Queen situation, in which each speciation event in a clade deteriorates the fitness of coexisting species in the same clade (provided that there is phylogenetic niche conservatism). = Evolution of sex = Discussions of the evolution of sex was not part of Van Valen's Red Queen hypothesis, which addressed evolution at scales above the species level. The microevolutionary version of the Red Queen hypothesis was proposed by Bell (1982), also citing Lewis Carroll, but not citing Van Valen. The Red Queen hypothesis is used independently by Hartung. Genome Parliaments and Sex with the Red Queen. In: Alexander, R.D., Tinkle, D. W., Eds. Natural Selection and Social Behavior: Recent Research and New Theory. New York: Chiron Press, 1981, 382-402 and Bell to explain the evolution of sex, by John Jaenike to explain the maintenance of sex and W. D. Hamilton to explain the role of sex in response to parasites. In all cases, sexual reproduction confers species variability and a faster generational response to selection by making offspring genetically unique. Sexual species are able to improve their genotype in changing conditions. Consequently, co-evolutionary interactions, between host and parasite, for example, may select for sexual reproduction in hosts in order to reduce the risk of infection. Oscillations in genotype frequencies are observed between parasites and hosts in an antagonistic coevolutionary way without necessitating changes to the phenotype. In multi- host and multi-parasite coevolution, the Red Queen dynamics could affect what host and parasite types will become dominant or rare.Science writer Matt Ridley popularized the term in connection with sexual selection in his 1993 book The Red Queen, in which he discussed the debate in theoretical biology over the adaptive benefit of sexual reproduction to those species in which it appears. The connection of the Red Queen to this debate arises from the fact that the traditionally accepted Vicar of Bray hypothesis only showed adaptive benefit at the level of the species or group, not at the level of the gene (although the protean \\"Vicar of Bray\\" adaptation is very useful to some species that belong to the lower levels of the food chain). By contrast, a Red-Queen-type thesis suggesting that organisms are running arms races with their parasites can explain the utility of sexual reproduction at the level of the gene by positing that the role of sex is to preserve genes that are currently disadvantageous, but that will become advantageous against the background of a likely future population of parasites. Further evidence of the Red Queen hypothesis was observed in allelic effects under sexual selection. The Red Queen Hypothesis leads to the understanding that allelic recombination is advantageous for populations that engage in aggressive biotic interactions, such as predator-prey or parasite-host interactions. In cases of parasite-host relations, sexual reproduction can quicken the production of new multi-locus genotypes allowing the host to escape parasites that have adapted to the prior generations of typical hosts. Mutational effects can be represented by models to describe how recombination through sexual reproduction can be advantageous. According to the mutational deterministic hypothesis, if the deleterious mutation rate is high, and if those mutations interact to cause a general decline in organismal fitness, then sexual reproduction provides an advantage over asexually reproducing organisms by allowing populations to eliminate the deleterious mutations not only more rapidly, but also most effectively. Recombination is one of the fundamental means that explain why many organisms have evolved to reproduce sexually. Sexual organisms must spend resources to find mates. In the case of sexual dimorphism, usually one of the sexes contributes more to the survival of their offspring (usually the mother). In such cases, the only adaptive benefit of having a second sex is the possibility of sexual selection, by which organisms can improve their genotype. Evidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by the comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for kinases and immunoglobulins in the immune system with genes coding other proteins. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster. Further evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long‚Äêterm dynamics and parasite coevolution in a mixed sexual and asexual population of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). The number of sexuals, the number of asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once-plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time. In 2011, researchers used the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a host and the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens to generate a host‚Äìparasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the mating system of C. elegans, causing populations to mate either sexually, by self- fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the S. marcescens parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of C. elegans were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites, while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis. Currently, there is no consensus among biologists on the main selective forces maintaining sex. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex have been reviewed by Birdsell and Wills.Birdsell JA, Wills C (2003). The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models. Evolutionary Biology Series >> Evolutionary Biology, Vol. 33 pp. 27-137. MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer. Hardcover , Softcover . = Evolution of aging = Predator-prey relationship between rabbits and foxes following the principle of the Red Queen hypothesis. The rabbit evolves increasing its speed to escape the attack of the fox, and the fox evolves increasing its speed to reach the rabbit. This evolution is constant, in case one of the two stops evolving, its extinction will occur. The Red Queen hypothesis has been also invoked by some authors to explain evolution of aging. The main idea is that aging is favored by natural selection since it allows faster adaptation to changing conditions, especially in order to keep pace with the evolution of pathogens, predators and prey. =Interspecies arms race= * A number of predator/prey couple where the weapon involved is the running speed. \\"The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner.\\" AesopDawkins, Richard. The Selfish Gene:30th Anniversary Edition. Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 250. The predator-prey relationship can also be established in the microbial world, producing the same evolutionary phenomenon that occurs in the case of foxes and rabbits. A recently observed example has as protagonists M.xanthus (predator) and E.coli (prey) in which a parallel evolution of both species can be observed through genomic and phenotypic modifications, producing in future generations a better adaptation of one of the species that is counteracted by the evolution of the other, thus generating an arms race that can only be stopped by the extinction of one of the species.Nair, Ramith R.; Vasse, Marie; Wielgoss, S√©bastien; Sun, Lei; Yu, Yuen-Tsu N.; Velicer, Gregory J. \\"Bacterial predator-prey coevolution accelerates genome evolution and selects on virulence-associated prey defences\\", Nature Communications, 2019, 10:4301. * The interactions between parasitoid wasps and insect larvae, necessary for the parasitic wasp's life cycle, are also a good illustration of an arms race. Indeed, some evolutionary strategy was found by both partners to respond to the pressure generated by the mutual association of lineages. For example, the parasitoid wasp group, Campoletis sonorensis, is able to fight against the immune system of its hosts, Heliothis virescens (Lepidopteran) with the association of a polydnavirus (PDV) (Campoletis sonorensis PDV). During the oviposition process, the parasitoid transmits the virus (CsPDV) to the insect larva. The CsPDV will alter the physiology, growth and development of the infected insect larvae to the benefit of the parasitoid. Court jester hypothesis A competing evolutionary idea is the court jester hypothesis, which indicates that an arms race is not the driving force of evolution on a large scale, but rather it is abiotic factors. Black Queen Hypothesis The Black Queen Hypothesis is a theory of reductive evolution that suggests natural selection can drive organisms to reduce their genome size. In other words, a gene that confers a vital biological function can become dispensable for an individual organism if its community members express that gene in a \\"leaky\\" fashion. Like the Red Queen Hypothesis, the Black Queen Hypothesis is a theory of co- evolution.  Trivia  Van Valen originally submitted his article to the Journal of Theoretical Biology, where it was accepted for publication. However, because \\"the manner of processing depended on payment of page charges\\", Van Valen withdraw his manuscript and founded a new Journal called \\"Evolutionary Theory\\", in which he published his manuscript as the first paper. The journal \\"Evolutionary Theory\\" was produced in Van Valens office on a photocopy machine under the motto \\"substance over form.\\" Another noteworthy detail is Van Valen's acknowledgement to the National Science Foundation: \\"I thank the National Science Foundation for regularly rejecting my (honest) grant applications for work on real organisms, thus forcing me into theoretical work\\".

A transponder working on a radio-frequency identification (RFID) basis is attached to the athlete and emits a unique code that is detected by radio receivers located at the strategic points in an event. Prior to the use of this technology, races were either timed by hand (with operators pressing a stopwatch) or using video camera systems.  Transponder systems  Generically, there are two types of transponder timing systems; active and passive. An active transponder consists of a battery-powered transceiver, connected to the athlete, that emits its unique code when it is interrogated. A passive transponder does not contain a power source inside the transponder. Instead, the transponder captures electromagnetic energy produced by a nearby exciter and utilizes that energy to emit a unique code. In both systems, an antenna is placed at the start, finish, and in some cases, intermediate time points and is connected to a decoder. This decoder identifies the unique transponder code and calculates the exact time when the transponder passes a timing point. Some implementations of timing systems require the use of a mat on the ground at the timing points while other systems implement the timing points with vertically oriented portals.  History  RFID was first used in the late 1980s primarily for motor racing and became more widely adopted in athletic events in the mid-1990s upon the release of low cost 134 kHz transponders and readers from Texas Instruments. This technology formed the basis of electronic sports timing for the world's largest running events as well as for cycling, triathlon and skiing. Some manufacturers made improvements to the technology to handle larger numbers of transponders in the read field or improve the tolerance of their systems to low-frequency noise. These low-frequency systems are still used a lot today. Other manufacturers developed their own proprietary RFID systems usually as an offshoot to more industrial applications. These latter systems attempted to get around the problem of reading large numbers of transponders in a read field by using the High Frequency 13.56 MHz RFID methodology that allowed transponders to use anti-collision algorithms to avoid tags interfering with each other's signal during the down-link between transponder and reader. Active transponder systems continued to mature and despite their much higher cost they retained market share in the high speed sports like motor racing, cycling and ice skating. Active systems are also used at high-profile events such as the Olympics due to their very high read rates and time-stamping precision. f By 2005 a newer RFID technology was becoming available, mostly for industrial applications. The first and second generation (UHF) transponders and readers that were being developed followed a strict protocol to ensure that multiple transponders and readers could be used between manufacturers.Class 1 Generation 2 UHF Air Interface Protocol Standard \\"Gen 2\\" Much like the HF tags, the UHF tags were much cheaper to produce in volume and formed the basis in the next revolution in sports timing. Currently, many of the largest athletic events are timed using disposable transponders either placed on the back of a race number or on the runner's shoe. The low cost meant that transponders were now fully disposable and did not need to be returned to the organizers after the event.  Usage  Very large running events (more than 10,000) and triathlons were the first events to be transponder (or chip) timed because it is near impossible to manually time them. Also for large runs there are delays in participants reaching the start line, which penalize their performance. Some races place antennas or timing mats at both the start line and the finish line, which allow the exact net time to be calculated. Awards in a race are generally based on the \\"gun time\\" (which ignores any delay at the start) as per IAAF and USA Track and Field rules. However, some races use \\"net time\\" for presenting age group awards. In the past the transponder was almost always worn on the athletes running shoe, or on an ankle band. This enabled the transponder to be read best on antenna mats because the distance between the transponder and readers antenna is minimized offering the best capture rate. Transponders may be threaded onto the shoe laces for running. For triathlon a soft elastic ankle band holds the transponder to the leg and care is taken to ensure the transponder is in the correct orientation or polarity for maximum read performance. Transponders have also been placed on the race bib. In the past 5 years the newer UHF systems use transponders placed on the shoe lace, or stuck to the race number bib. In both cases, care must be taken to ensure the UHF tag does not directly touch a large part of the skin as this affects read performance. Despite this, UHF Systems have read performances as good (if not better) than the conventional low and high frequency systems. Because these UHF tags are made in huge volumes for industrial applications, their price is much lower than that of conventional re-usable transponders and the race does not bother to collect them afterwards. As of 2015, many UHF timers use a combination of ground antennas with panel antenna(s) mounted on a tripod at the side of the race course. Disposable bib with two passive timing chips at the back Back side of disposable RFID tag used for race timing All RFID timing systems incorporate a box housing the reader(s) with peripherals like a microprocessor, serial or ethernet communications and power source (battery). The readers are attached to one or more antennas that are designed for the particular operating frequency. In the case of low or medium frequencies these consist of wire loops incorporated into mats that cover the entire width of the timing point. For UHF systems the antennas consist of patch antennas that are protected in a matting system. The patch antennas may also be placed on stands or a finish gantry pointing towards the oncoming athlete. In most cases the distance between reader and antennas is restricted. Also more equipment is needed for events that require multiple timing points. Wider timing points require more readers and antennas. For active systems a simple wire loop is all that is needed since the transponder has its own power source and the loop serves as a trigger to turn on the transponder, then receive the relatively strong signal from the transponder. Therefore, active systems need less readers (or decoders) per timing point width. All systems utilize specialized software to calculate results and splits.Fister, I. Jr., Fister, I., Mernik, M., Brest, J. Design and implementation of domain-specific language Easytime. Computer Languages, Systems & Structures, 37(4), 151-167, 2011. This software usually resides on a separate PC computer that is connected to the readers via serial or ethernet communications. The software relates the raw transponder code and timestamp data to each entrant in a database and calculates gun and net times of runners, or the splits of a triathlete.Fister, I. Jr., Mernik, M., Fister, I., Hrnƒçiƒç, D. Implementation of EasyTime formal semantics using a LISA compiler generator, Comput. Sci. Inf. Syst., vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 1019-1044, 2012. In advanced systems these results are instantly calculated and published to the internet so that athletes and spectators have access to results via any web enabled device.

His ideas had a profound influence on the art of Fra Angelico who entered the order through him. But he once encountered difficulties becoming a friar due to a speech impediment that his superiors believed would rule him ineligible for both profession and the priesthood. Dominici became a noted theologian and preacher and was tireless in establishing monasteries and convents in cities such as Fiesole and Lucca. He attempted to resign his cardinalate in 1415 during the Council of Constance after he succeeded in convincing the pope to abdicate in order to end the Western Schism. But the Council refused to accept his resignation though he had resigned from the archbishopric that he held. He spent the remainder of his life as a papal legate for Pope Martin V until he died in Buda. He had been first named as a Blessed since 1622 though he had not been recognized as such until he was beatified on 9 April 1832. Life Giovanni Dominici was born in Florence in 1355 to the poor but devout Domenico Dominici (a silk merchant) and Paola Zorzi. His father died while his mother was pregnant with Giovanni. In his childhood he spent hours in the Dominican-run Santa Maria Novella church. If someone needed to see him his mother directed them to the church and said: \\"There he spends all his houses\\". It therefore stood to reason that in 1370 he sought admission into the order. But he suffered from a severe speech impediment which - combined with a lack of formal education - made the friars doubt his vocation to their order. They refused him admission a number of times until 1372 and even insisted that he should remain home to care for his mother. But his mother insisted that Dominici should follow his calling for it was not for her to stand against his religious calling. He was then accepted and began his novitiate with the friars there and he began his studies in Pisa and Florence. The friars were surprised to see that he had a sharp mind with a good grasp of the complexities of theological and philosophical subject so much so that he was sent to the college in Paris to further his studies. On his return from Paris when he completed his theological studies his speech impediment became the problem which the authorities of the order had feared from the beginning. Preaching was an expected part of each friar's life which would prove to be problematic for Dominici. He sought the intercession of the Dominican secular Saint Catherine of Siena and he was cured of this impediment. Dominici was ordained to the priesthood in 1380. He was then appointed as a professor and preacher and held that post for over a decade in Venice. Dominici became the prior for the order's house at Santa Maria Novella in 1381 and retained the position until serving as the prior from 1386 to 1387. He was teaching at San Zanipolo in Venice from 1388 until 1389 when he left. In 1392 he was appointed as the Vicar Provincial for the Roman province of the order in 1392. It was a time of disorder for the Dominicans for the order had suffered major losses in membership through a great plague. The convent in Venice had lost 77 friars in a matter of months as an example. The Master General Raymond of Capua authorized Dominici to establish priories of strict observance in Venice (1394) and Fiesole (1406). It was in the latter that the talented artists and brothers Giovanni and Benedetto entered the order around 1407. Giovanni would later be known as Fra Angelico. Dominici also founded the Corpus Domini convent in Venice for the Dominican nuns of the strict observance; an account of his life was found in the chronicle and necrology of that place after Bartolomea Riccoboni discovered it. He also corresponded with Chiara Gambacorti and advised her on how to restore discipline to Dominican nuns. Dominici received into the order on 4 August 1405 four men which included the future Archbishop of Florence Antoninus after the latter heard him preach once. The two worked together in Fiesole. Vincent Ferrer was once preaching in Genoa when an invitation was extended for him to preach in Florence. But Ferrer said he would not since a saint (Dominici) was among their number and was preaching. Dominici was sent as the Venetian representative to the papal conclave of 1406 in which Pope Gregory XII was elected. He soon became the counsellor and confessor for the pope who on 26 March 1408 appointed him as the Archbishop of Ragusa. In mid-1408 the pope named him as a cardinal and sent him as ambassador to the Hungarian kingdom to secure the adhesion of Sigismund to the pope. On 26 March 1408 he was sent with Giacopo del Torso to negotiate with Antipope Benedict XIII in an attempt to secure the latter's abdication though this was unsuccessful. Dominici was present at the Council of Constance (which he convinced the pope to convoke) on 4 July 1415 when he read the resignation letter that the pope had written. Dominici had advised the pope to abdicate as the surest means of ending the Great Schism which had arisen to divide the Church. It was also at that point that he tried to resign his cardinalate to make clear to all that he had no desire to advance through his accomplishment. But the Council rejected that resignation and he remained as a cardinal. It had been before this that he tried to convince Antipope John XXIII to abdicate though that proved useless. Pope Martin V (who sometimes sought his counsel) appointed him as the papal legate to Bohemia on 19 July 1418 but he accomplished little with the followers of John Hus owing to the timid King Wenceslaus IV. But he had been present when Hus was burnt at the stake back in 1415. On 23 July 1409 he was named as the abbot commendatario for the Santi Andrea e Saba convent while named provost commendatario for the Santa Maria dell'Isola Tremici convent. On 1 January 1411 he was appointed as a legate to both Genoa and Milan. He later was named as the abbot commendatario for the Benedictine convent of Santi Vito e Salvo on 13 January 1411. Dominici died at Buda on 10 June 1419 from a fever and he was buried in the Saint Paul the Hermit church there. His tomb became a site of miracles and his remains were venerated until the destruction of the church during a Turkish invasion. Antoninus of Florence later wrote a memoir on Dominici. =Beatification= Dominici's holiness had been renowned during his life and he was venerated soon after his death with miracles being reported at his tomb. Pope Gregory XVI beatified Dominici centuries later on 9 April 1832. Published works Dominici was a prolific writer on spiritual subjects but he was also a graceful poet; his vernacular songs or Laudi show his tact as a poet. His Regola del governo di cura familiare, written between 1400 and 1405 is a pedagogical work which treats (in four books) of the faculties of the soul as well as the powers and senses of people. He also touched on the uses of material goods and the education of children. His Lucula Noctis (which he addressed to the Chancellor of the Florentine Republic Coluccio Salutati) is the most important treatise of that time on the studies of the pagan authors. Dominici did not condemn classical studies outright though did express strong criticism of some humanist tendencies such as the use of rhetoric in politics and the rise of the professional politician. There is now an Open Access revised edition of Hunt's 1940 critical edition of the Lucula provided on The Manipulus/Lucula noctis Project website.

First as Prior Provincial of Lombardy and then as Master General of the Order, Raymond undertook the restoration of Dominican religious life. For his success in this endeavor, he is referred to as its \\"second founder\\".Catholic Online Raymond worked also for the return of the papacy to Rome and for a solution to the Western schism. The important mystic and author, Catherine of Siena, accepted him as a spiritual director because of his burning passion for the Church and for the revival of religious life. He was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1899. Life He was born \\"Raymond della Vigna\\" about 1330 in Capua (then part of the Kingdom of Naples), a member of a prominent family of that city, and was a descendant of Pietro della Vigna (a figure mentioned in Dante's Divine Comedy). In 1350, while a student of law at the University of Bologna, he entered the Dominican Order. For the next twenty-five years he worked as a spiritual director or as a teacher in various communities of the Order. Raymond was first assigned to Montepulciano, where he served as a chaplain to a monastery of nuns of the Dominican Second Order. He was the first biographer of their venerated former prioress, Agnes of Montepulciano, who had died about fifty years earlier. He was then stationed in Rome, to serve as the prior of the friars at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Later he was sent to Siena, where he was assigned by the Master General to be the spiritual director and confessor to the noted Dominican tertiary, Catherine of Siena. Raymond spent the next six years advising her and hearing her confidences. While there, Raymond gradually learned to trust her holiness and her judgment. This was sealed when he became involved in nursing victims of a plague in 1374. When he contracted the disease himself and lay near death, Catherine came and sat at his bedside until he recovered. Knowing how close he was to death, Raymond credited his recovery to her prayers. By 1374 Raymond had come to the attention of Pope Gregory XI, then living in Avignon, as a result of his connection to Catherine, and also for his novel ways of confronting issues like the Crusades in the Holy Land, the return of the papacy to Rome, and the general reform of the Church. He was well known for his ability to pass seamlessly from dealing with spiritual and supernatural considerations to the more mundane matters of practical politics. For four years Raymond accompanied Catherine in her journeys, and went to Avignon to act as an intermediary between her and the pope. Catherine had such faith in the commitment of the pope to the cause of a Crusade, that she sent a personal letter to the infamous English pirate, John Hawkwood, asking him to re-direct his efforts to the service of God in this cause. Pope Gregory would finally return to Rome in 1377, but he died in 1378. The refusal of the French cardinals to accept the election of his successor, Pope Urban VI, led to the Great Western schism that lasted 39 years, with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon. This schism divided Europe. Raymond, like Catherine, supported the Roman papacy and defended its legitimacy. In 1379 by command of Pope Urban VI Raymond was examined by Fra. Giacomo Altoviti who promoted him to the grade of Master of Theology. In the year 1380, Catherine died and Raymond was elected Master General of Dominican Order. He then divided his time between Italy and Germany. In the Caterinian spirit of reform, he gave a new spiritual vitality to the Order. Raymond favored the development of a new interpretation of \\"observance\\", for which he drew upon the Franciscan example. In this work he gained the designation of being the second founder of the Order of the Preachers. Veneration Raymond was buried first in Nuremberg (now Germany) where he died, but his body was later moved to Naples, to the Church of San Domenico Maggiore. In 1899 Pope Leo XIII beatified him on the 500th anniversary of his death. Modern Editions and Translations *Legenda maior, ed.

The organization was founded by Gary Hickling, a musician and expert on Lehmann. Hickling was also the founder of the Lotte Lehmann League. Inception and history Founder Gary Hickling had met Lotte Lehmann in the early 1960s when he was a double bass player at university, observing the private voice lessons Lehmann gave at Orplid, her home in Santa Barbara. He later observed her master classes at the Music Academy of the West, which she had helped found in 1947. Hickling became a noted expert on Lehmann's career and work, compiling a Lehmann discography in 1987. He continued to compile and collect material and memorabilia relating to her career, which now forms a significant part of the Lotte Lehmann Archive in Santa Barbara. The foundation's precursor, the Lotte Lehmann League, published a newsletter from 1989 to 1994; the league was later re-established as a website in 2011. Hickling founded the Lotte Lehmann Foundation in 1999. In the early years of its existence, he was solely responsible for maintaining it. Operations of the foundation were transferred from Hawaii, where Hickling lived, to New York City in 2003. The composer Daron Hagen was chosen as the newly configured foundation's president, and an entirely new board of directors was chosen at that time. Mezzo soprano Linn Maxwell was elected president in 2007. Larry Smith was president beginning in 2010. Hickling retired from the foundation in 2005 and became an emeritus member of the Board of Directors. As of 2016, the foundation is in hiatus.Lotte Lehmann \\"Afterlife\\", lottelehmannleague.org Since 1988, Hickling has hosted a weekly program on art songs on Hawaii Public Radio, initially titled Great Songs, and from 2011 titled Singing and Other Sins. Information and listenable archives of the program are hosted on the Lotte Lehmann League website. Activities The Lehmann Foundation was a respected non-profit musical foundation in the United States. Its activities included two competitions, the first of which, the internet-based CyberSing vocal competition occurred every two years and solicited recordings from singers the world over. Entrants submitted recordings of appropriate literature, including a song written expressly for the competition by a distinguished composer. These songs were commissioned from composers such as Ned Rorem, Libby Larsen and Dan Welcher. Winners were chosen solely on the basis of their recorded submissions. Laureates of the 2006 competition included sopranos Debra Stanley and Danielle Talamantes and baritone Andrew Garland. The ASCAP/Lotte Lehmann Foundation Song Cycle Competition, which occurred in alternating years with CyberSing, solicited compositions by young composers resident in or native of the United States; winners received commissions to compose individual songs or, in the case of the first prize recipient, a song cycle. Winners of the 2005 competition included Scott Gendel and Mark Buntag. Gendel's prize-winning commission, the song cycle The Space Between was published by E. C. Schirmer and premiered by soprano Martha Guth and pianist Bradley Moore on 24 February 2007 at the Bruno Walter Auditorium in New York under the auspices of the Joy in Singing Foundation. VoxNova Media was another aspect of the foundation's activities. The mission of this division was to produce media in a variety of forms, including audio recordings, video recordings, printed materials. VNM plan was to reissue historical audio recordings by Lehmann and her colleagues, present new recordings of contemporary vocal repertoire and of the vocal art of contemporary interpreters. In addition to these programs and activities, the foundation presented an annual World of Song Award which alternated among composers, singers, and collaborative pianists and served to recognize those who have devoted their creative lives to this enriching form of music.\\"World of Song Award\\", lottelehmannleague.org Recipients include pianist and educator John Wustman, composers Dominick Argento and Ned Rorem, pianists Dalton Baldwin and Graham Johnson, tenor Hugues Cu√©nod, mezzo soprano Janet Baker, and baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. The foundation also published SongScape, a biannual newsletter edited by board member Craig Urquhart and featuring news of the foundation's activities.\\"League & Foundation Newsletters\\", lottelehmannleague.org References External links *Lotte Lehman League, includes material on Lehmann's career and extensive material on art song Category:Arts foundations based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in California ","title":"Lotte Lehmann Foundation"},{"id":"9918183","text":"T-Street is a beach in San Clemente, California a short distance south of the town pier.

This condition may result from allostatic responses of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid feedback control, dyshomeostatic disorders, drug interferences, and impaired assay characteristics in critical illness. The classical phenotype of this condition is often seen in starvation, critical illness, or patients in the intensive care unit. Similar endocrine phenotypes are observed in fetal life and in hibernating mammals. The most common hormone pattern in nonthyroidal illness syndrome is low total and free T3, elevated rT3, and normal T4 and TSH levels, although T4 and TSH suppression may occur in more severe or chronic illness. This classical pattern results from type 1 allostatic load, i.e. a stress response resulting from lacking energy, oxygen, and glutathione. An alternative phenotype with a largely inverse hormonal pattern is seen in several physiological and pathological conditions, including pregnancy, obesity, endurance training, and psychiatric diseases. It is typically associated with high-T3 syndrome, increased plasma protein binding of thyroid hormones, and an elevated set point of the homeostatic system. It represents a response to type-2 allostatic load.  Classical phenotype (type 1 thyroid allostasis)  =Causes= Causes of classical euthyroid sick syndrome include a number of acute and chronic conditions, including pneumonia, fasting, starvation, anorexia nervosa, sepsis, trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass, malignancy, stress, heart failure, hypothermia, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, cirrhosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, surgery, infection, brain injury, shock, cancer, and HIV. Outside the hospital setting, euthyroid sick syndrome (nonthyroidal illness syndrome - NTIS) has been assumed closely related with a series of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, an NTIS-like phenotype can be present in major depressive disorder, as well as overexercise. =Pathophysiology= In critical illness, the activity of different deiodinases is altered. Humoral and neuronal inputs at the level of the hypothalamus may adjust the set point of thyroid homeostasis. This may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the central component of thyroid allostasis in critical illness, tumors, uremia and starvation (TACITUS). In addition, both illness and medication (e.g. salicylates and heparin) may impair plasma protein binding of thyroid hormones, resulting in reduced levels of total hormones, while free hormone concentrations may be temporarily elevated. Euthyroid sick syndrome probably represents an overlap of an allostatic response with pathologic reactions and drug interferences. Allostatic overload may result in wasting syndrome and myxedema coma. Thyroid storm, though, represents allostatic failure, where the organism is unable to develop NTIS in the situation of thyrotoxicosis.  Deiodinases  D1, D2, and D3 regulate the levels of T4, T3, and rT3. Three primary deiodinases are responsible for thyroid hormone conversion and breakdown. Type 1 (D1) deiodinates T4 to the biologically active T3, as well as the hormonally inactive and possibly inhibitory rT3. Type 2 (D2) converts T4 into T3, and breaks down rT3. D3 produces rT3 from T4, and breaks down T3. The balance of D2 and D3 is important for overall T3/rT3 balance. In NTIS, the concentrations of these deiodinases are altered, although whether NTIS is the cause or effect of this in peripheral tissues is unclear; in some studies, the alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations occurred before the changes in deiodinase activity. Typically, peripheral D1 and D2 are downregulated, while peripheral D3 is upregulated; this is associated with lower T4 and increased rT3.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis downregulation  Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) neurons in the hypothalamus integrate global signals about the body's energy state. They may be stimulated by signals such as leptin, alpha- MSH, and catecholamines; and inhibited by glucocorticoids, neuropeptide Y, and agouti-related peptide. The HPT Axis. In critical illness, inflammation increases tanycyte D2 in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, leading to local tissue hyperthyroidism. There may also be decreased central D3. This causes negative feedback on the HPT axis, and therefore reduced TRH gene expression in the PVN. This is exemplified by the common NTIS phenotype of low TSH even in the face of peripheral hypothyroidism.  Cytokines  Illness can cause inflammation, which often involves an increase in cytokines such as TNFa, IL-1, and IL-6. Cytokines are implicated in NTIS. IL-1Œ≤ has been shown to decrease liver D1, as well as thyroid hormone receptor (THR) levels. IL-6 and TNFa downregulate D1 and suppress TSH, are negatively correlated with fT3, and are positively correlated with rT3. NF-Œ∫B also inhibits D1, and decreases the expression of Thyroid receptors Œ± and Œ≤. IFNy inhibits thyroid and Tg release, and also inhibits the upregulation of TSH receptors.  Thyroid hormone receptors  In chronic liver and renal (kidney) failure, increased THR expression occurs. In contrast, in acute illness such as sepsis and trauma, decreased THR expression occurs.  Thyroid hormone transporters  During NTIS, alterations arise in the concentrations of thyroid hormone transporters such as MCT8 and MCT10, although whether the levels are increased or decreased depends on the study. The altered concentrations are thought to be a result of NTIS, rather than a cause; a study in rabbits showed that administering thyroid hormones normalized transporter expression.  Binding proteins  Decreased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) occurs following bypass surgery, and in chronic illness, a less effective form of TBG with lower affinity for thyroxine is synthesized. Reduced quantities of bound thyroid result, leading to decreased total thyroid measurements. Decreases in total thyroid may be more severe than alternations in free hormone levels.  Drugs  Dopamine and corticosteroids, commonly given in the hospital setting, can suppress TSH and suppress conversion of T4 to T3. Other drugs such as estrogen, contraceptives, salicylates, and phenytoin can alter the binding of TBG to TH, resulting in different TH concentrations. Additionally, lithium disrupts thyroid function, and thyromimetic endocrine disrupters may downregulate the HPT axis. = Fasting = Fasting is a common response in inflammation and critical illness. Originally, selenium deficiency as a result of malnutrition was thought to reduce D1 catalytic activity, but this theory has not been supported as a cause of NTIS.A fasting response is common in critical illness. NTIS as a result of fasting may be regarded as a healthy and adaptive mechanism that reduces energy expenditure. Fasting in healthy, euthyroid people causes reduced T3 and elevated rT3, although TSH is usually unchanged. Even moderate weight loss can lower T3. This may be primarily via reduced levels of leptin (the satisfaction hormone). Low leptin levels can downregulate hypothalamic TRH neurons and cause a reduction in TSH. Œôn fasting animals, administering leptin reverses NTIS symptoms and restores thyroid hormone concentrations. In obesity, increased leptin increases TSH and T3, and lowers rT3, possibly as an attempt to increase energy expenditure and return to weight set point. Other signals associated with hunger also affect the HPT axis. Insulin and bile acids, which are elevated after a meal, lead to increased D2 activity, therefore increasing T3 and reducing rT3. Low leptin increases NPY and AGRP (associated with appetite), which inhibit TRH gene expression; this effect is enhanced by ghrelin (the hunger hormone). a-MSH stimulates TRH gene expression in the PVN. This is enhanced by leptin, and inhibited by low leptin. a-MSH is also antagonized by AGRP.  Alternative phenotype (type 2 thyroid allostasis)  An anti-NTIS phenotype is observed in some circumstances, wherein TSH, T3, and T4 are generally elevated rather than suppressed. This can occur during pregnancy, obesity, cold adaptation, stay in high altitudes, endurance exercise, acute psychosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder. According to newer theories, elevated concentrations of TSH and thyroid hormones in type 2 allostasis result from an up-regulated set point of the feedback loop, which ensues from increased TRH expression in the basolateral amygdala and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in response to stress. High-T3 syndrome in thyroid carcinoma may result from autonomous thyroid hormone secretion or overexpression of type 2 deiodinase in cancer cells rather than from type 2 allostasis.  Conditions with mixed phenotypes  = Psychiatry = Stress suppresses TSH, and alterations in thyroid hormone levels may arise in psychiatric illness. In major depressive disorder, an NTIS-like phenotype may be observed, with reduced T3 and increased rT3. T4 may be elevated, and TSH is usually normal, although TSH's normal circadian rhythm may be disrupted. Bipolar 1 and PTSD can exemplify an anti-NTIS phenotype, with upregulation of the HPT axis and increased T3. This may also occur during acute schizophrenic episodes. = Exercise = After exercise, a transient increase occurs in TSH, T4, and T3, but this is thought to be due to increased blood concentration as a result of dehydration. The effects normalize after rest. After long-term heavy strain, levels of thyroid hormones decrease. This is exacerbated by other stressors such as undernutrition and lack of sleep, such as in a military training setting. During endurance exercise, before exhaustion, elevated thyroid hormone levels may happen due to increased expected energy demand (type 2 allostatic load). = Environmental conditions = Cold exposure and stay at high altitude may lead to type 1 or type 2 phenotype, depending on duration and other boundary conditions (which determine whether or not stress is associated with energy deprivation). Diagnosis Affected patients may have normal, low, or slightly elevated TSH depending on the spectrum and phase of illness. Total T4 and T3 levels may be altered by binding protein abnormalities, and medications. Reverse T3 levels are generally increased, while FT3 is decreased. FT4 levels may have a transient increase, before becoming subnormal during severe illness. Correspondingly, in the majority of cases calculated sum activity of peripheral deiodinases (SPINA-GD) is reduced. Generally the levels of free T3 will be lowered, followed by the lowering of free T4 in more severe disease. Several studies described elevated concentrations of 3,5-T2, an active thyroid hormone, in NTIS. 3,5-T2 levels were also observed to correlate with concentrations of rT3 (reverse T3) in patients with euthyroid sick syndrome. NTIS is a component of a complex endocrine adaptation process, so affected patients might also have hyperprolactinemia and elevated levels of corticosteroids (especially cortisol) and growth hormone. NTIS can be difficult to distinguish from other forms of thyroid dysfunction in the hospital setting. Both NTIS and primary hypothyroidism may have reduced fT3 and fT4, and elevated TSH (which is common in the hospital, during the recovery phase of NTIS). Prescribing thyroxine to treat this may lead to lifelong thyroid overtreatment. Hyperthyroidism may be assumed due to decreased TSH and a transient fT4 increase. In some cases, this can be distinguished from NTIS by a thyroid ultrasound, which is commonly available in the hospital intensive care unit. NTIS looks similar to central hypopituitarism; both frequently have reduced TSH and thyroid hormone levels. Treatment Debate is ongoing as to whether NTIS is an adaptive or maladaptive mechanism in response to physiological stress. Some sources indicate that NTIS is beneficial as an acute-phase response, but detrimental during the chronic phase of illness. Several trials have investigated a possible therapy for NTIS, but they yielded inconsistent and partly contradictory results. This may be due to the heterogeneity of investigated populations, and to the lack of a consistent definition of NTIS. Administering exogenous T3 and T4 has variable results, but overall seems to confer no improvements to health outcome. Administering TRH to patients with chronic illness, however, seems to normalize thyroid levels and improve catabolic function, although whether this is beneficial is unclear. When NTIS is caused by the normal fasting response to illness, early parenteral nutrition has been shown to attenuate alterations in thyroid hormone (TSH, T3, T4, rT3) levels, whereas late parenteral nutrition exacerbates it. Late parenteral nutrition, though, also reduced complications and accelerated recovery in one study.  History  In 1968, a reduced T4 half-life in athletes was discovered. This was the first awareness of thyroid hormone concentration alterations that were not a result of thyroid gland or pituitary dysfunction. In 1971, they also found a transient increase in T4 during bicycle training. In 1973, Rothenbuchner et al. discovered that starvation is correlated with reduced T3 concentration. Following this, a similar phenotype was noted in patients with critical illness, tumors, and uremia. The alternative phenotype of type-2 thyroid allostasis was first predicted in 1968, when John W. Mason expected the concentrations of thyroid hormones to rise in situations of psychosocial stress. Mason's postulate was later confirmed by numerous studies.

The inscription on the plinth The inscription on the plinth reads as follows: > This monument records the names and commemorates the valour and devotion of > XI [11] officers and CCCXVIII [318] non-commissioned officers and men of the > LXVI [66th] Berkshire Regiment who gave their lives for their country at > Girishk Maiwand and Kandahar and during the Afghan Campaign MDCCCLXXIX > [1879] ‚Äì MDCCCLXXX [1880]. > \\"History does not afford any grander or finer instance of gallantry and > devotion to Queen and country than that displayed by the LXVI Regiment at > the Battle of Maiwand on the XXVII [27th] July MDCCCLXXX [1880].\\" > Despatch of General Primrose. Close-up of the lion The regiment lost approximately 258 men out of 500 (reports of the number vary, see the statue inscription total above) at the battle of Maiwand, having faced an Afghan army ten times larger than the British contingent. Eleven of the men, protecting the colours, made such a brave stand before their deaths that the Afghans who fought them reported it with great respect. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his character Doctor Watson on the regiment's Medical officer, Surgeon Major A F Preston, who was injured in battle. The sculptor was George Blackall Simonds, a member of a Reading brewing family from Simonds' Brewery. The sculpture took two years to design and complete, and the lion is one of the world's largest cast iron statues. Rumours persist that Simonds committed suicide on learning that the lion's gait was incorrectly that of a domestic cat. In fact, he made careful observations on lions and the stance was anatomically correct. He also lived for another 43 years, enjoying continuing success as a sculptor and later creating a statue of Queen Victoria (1887) and a statue of George Palmer (1891). He retired from sculpting in 1903 and worked in the family business, eventually becoming its chairman in 1910. In 1922 he temporarily came out of retirement to build the Bradfield war memorial, commemorating the deaths in the First World War of those in the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers, which included his son. The Maiwand Lion features on the front page of one of the local newspapers, the Reading Post, and also on the Reading Football Club crest. Its face featured on the medal given to the 15,000 finishers at the Reading Half Marathon race in 2016. A 3D Scan of the Lion The statue is made of cast iron and weighs 16 tons. It was cast by H. Young & Co. of Pimlico in 1886 and was originally supported on a terracotta pedestal. This was replaced with granite when the terracotta showed signed of cracking under the statue's weight. The rectangular pilastered plinth carries tablets recording the names of the dead, together with inscription above. The whole monument is listed grade II by English Heritage. The Loddon Brewery, located in Dunsden Green close to Reading, brew an IPA called Forbury Lion.

The -long route connected Highway 3 in downtown Windsor with Highway 2 south of Belle River, travelling along the southern shoreline of Lake St. Clair. Highway 39 was established in 1934. In 1961, the Pike Creek Bypass was opened and Highway 39 was rerouted along it. However, the entire route was renumbered as Highway 2 in 1970, retiring the designation from the provincial highway system. Highway 2 was itself decommissioned along the former route of Highway 39 on January 1, 1998 and transferred to Essex County and the City of Windsor. It was subsequently redesignated as Essex County Road 22\\\\.  Route description  Highway 39 began in downtown Windsor at the intersection of Ouellette Avenue and Riverside Drive, which was also the terminus of Highway 3B, Highway 18 and Highway 98\\\\. Highway 3B, Highway 98 as well as Highway 2 (which continued along Riverside Drive to the Ambassador Bridge) travelled concurrently south along Outlette Avenue to Tecumseh Boulevard. There, the designations split, with Highway 3B branching west and the others branching east. At Howard Avenue, Highway 2 and Highway 98 branched south, while Highway 39 continued east along Tecumseh Boulevard out of Windsor. At Banwell Road, Highway 39 jogged south from Tecumseh Boulevard to the Pike Creek Bypass, now Essex County Road 22, which it gently curved east onto. It followed that modern route south of Pike Creek, through Puce and Belle River, then curved south to end at Highway 2  History  = Reroutings = The road originally travelled along what is now Essex County Road 2 (Tecumseh Road), where it led straight into Windsor along today's Tecumseh Road. In 1961, the two-lane limited-access Pike Creek Bypass was created (and would eventually link up with the E.C. Row Expressway once it was built), that allowed traffic to avoid travelling down the busy County Road 2 (Tecumseh Road) between Puce and Tecumseh. Highway 39 was then re-routed along the new Pike Creek Bypass, deleting the other roads as provincial highways. The new routing of the road led it along its old path towards Puce, but then diverged along the Pike Creek Bypass towards Manning Road (Essex CR 19). It then turned right (north) for around 2 km, where it met up with Tecumseh Road (CR 2, its old alignment) in Tecumseh. It then turned left and travelled along Tecumseh Road, to its terminus with Highway 3B (Oullette Avenue). In 1970, Highway 2 was re-aligned along its path, eliminating Highway 39 from the system. Highway 2 would be decommissioned in 1998, however, and redesignated as Essex County Road 22. Aside from a brief segment east from Manning Road for about 1 km, the road is entirely 2-lanes and without store and house accesses (it was built as a two- lane expressway and only has access at intersections, with no adjacent properties or driveways). Due to the huge housing boom in western Lakeshore, the road has become extremely congested, and many people have desired the road be widened to four lanes, or even a divided highway or freeway, but due to the narrow right of way, the road is being widened to four lanes as a new Super- Arterial road or even a Super 4, with the possibility of an interchange at Manning Road. In 1970, Highway 2 was re-routed along all of Highway 39's path, thus deleting it. The Pike Creek Bypass was still in provincial control (as Highway 2) until 1998, when it, too was deleted. It is now known as Essex County Road 22.

He previously served as a Marine reservist, and was involved in a controversy about access to campus for military recruiters at Columbia University. In March 2007, Sanchez was awarded the first \\"Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award\\" at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In the early 90s, Sanchez performed in gay pornographic films as Pierre LaBranche and Rod Majors. He was involved in the Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy, as a source. Marine Corps service and inquiries In 2003, Sanchez joined the United States Marine Corps and was trained as a refrigeration mechanic with the rank of corporal. On March 16, 2007, John Hoellwarth, a staff writer for Military Times Media Group, reported that Sanchez was the subject of a Marine Corps inquiry about his appearances in gay pornographic videos and related allegations. Of concern was whether \\"Sanchez had enlisted prior to the end of his film career,\\" \\"if Reserve Marines were prohibited from doing porn when not in a drilling status,\\" and \\"how the current 'don't ask, don't tell' policy might apply.\\" In an article published April 1, 2007 by the Marine Corps Times, Hoellwarth wrote that the Marine Corps was also investigating reports that Sanchez had \\"wrongfully solicited funds to support [his] purported deployment to Iraq.\\" According to the article, a Marine investigator accused Sanchez of \\"coordinating a $300 payment from the New York City United War Veterans Council and $12,000 from U-Haul.\\" Sanchez told the newspaper that the charges were \\"demonstrably false,\\" and that he never collected any funds from the listed organizations. Political activism at Columbia University In 2005, while a junior at the Columbia University School of General Studies, Sanchez said he was harassed by students during the Fall 2005 \\"Activities Day\\" while manning the table for the Columbia Military Society. According to Sanchez, he was approached by members of the International Socialist Organization, an anti-war campus group who told him he was stupid for serving in the military. According to Mark Xue, president of the military society who was at the table with Sanchez, \\"They were telling him that he was stupid and ignorant, that he was being brainwashed and used for being a minority in the military.\\" Sanchez made a series of formal complaints to the university, which upon investigation found no grounds for punishing the three accused students. The accused dispute Sanchez's account of the events. In a Columbia Daily Spectator editorial, \\"The Conservative Witch Hunt,\\" Zach Zill wrote that while he did make clear that he found on-campus military recruitment offensive, he had done so without the use of epithets and derogatory language. Monique Dols, another of the accused Socialists, stated the complaint was false and \\"a discrediting campaign against us.\\" Sanchez and others in the student group MilVets, an organization for on-campus veterans, had also voiced their frustration at what they perceived to be a lack of regard for veterans on the campus. In February 2006, the university amended its non-discrimination policy to include \\"military status\\" for protection from harassment. According to the University, this was not a policy change, but merely a \\"semantic clarification,\\" as the words \\"military status\\" replaced \\"disabled or Vietnam era veteran.\\" Media coverage and CPAC On December 4, 2006, Sanchez wrote an opinion piece for the New York Post, titled, \\"Diversity Double-Talk: Ivy's 'Inclusion' excludes Military,\\" which led to his being invited onto various conservative talk shows in January 2007 to discuss the incident. On March 2, 2007, Sanchez was awarded the Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A featured speaker at the conference, Ann Coulter, made controversial remarks at the event, indirectly referring to presidential candidate John Edwards as a \\"faggot\\". In an article for Salon.com, Sanchez discussed how a photograph of him taken at the conference with Coulter brought him to the attention of bloggers, one of whom recognized him as a former pornographic gay film star. In the same article, Sanchez stated that bloggers had compared him to Rich Merritt, author of Secrets of a Gay Marine Porn Star, and Jeff Gannon, a conservative journalist who was outed as a gay escort. Commentary Matt Sanchez provided commentary and reports for WorldNetDaily and Foxnews.com, including as an embedded reporter in Afghanistan.Foxnews.com His work has appeared in the National Review Online, The Weekly Standard, and Human Events. Sanchez was a source associated with criticism of Scott Beauchamp's \\"Baghdad Diarist\\" writings which appeared in The New Republic. The story became nationally known when military bloggers (milbloggers) and Weekly Standard editor Michael Goldfarb raised doubt about the validity of the reports of the \\"Baghdad Diarist\\". Selected filmography In the early 1990s, Sanchez performed in gay pornographic movies, appearing as Pierre La Branche and Rod Majors. However, in a 2007 interview, Sanchez commented that \\"I don't like porn, it reduces the mind, flattens the soul\\" and that he considers his pornographic career an identity outgrown. { style=\\"width:100%;\\"  ; As \\"Rod Majors\\" * Jawbreaker, 1994 (Catalina Video) * Idol Country, 1994 (HIS Video)  ; As \\"Pierre LaBranche\\" * Call of the Wild, 1992, (Kristen Bjorn Video) * Montreal Men, 1992, (Kristen Bjorn Video) } References External links * Category:1970 births Category:American bloggers Category:American male pornographic film actors Category:Activists from California Category:Columbia University School of General Studies alumni Category:Living people Category:American actors in gay pornographic films Category:People from San Jose, California Category:United States Marines Category:American LGBT military personnel Category:American male journalists Category:LGBT journalists from the United States Category:Gay writers Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:LGBT pornographic film actors Category:LGBT people from California Category:Pornographic film actors from California Category:Journalists from California Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male bloggers ","title":"Matt Sanchez"},{"id":"9918417","text":"Houston Ballet‚Äôs Ben Stevenson Academy is a ballet training school affiliated with the Houston Ballet.

History It was founded as a daughter house of Strata Florida Abbey, Ceredigion. Llantarnam Abbey took its place among the Welsh Cistercian abbeys as the revival of political power supported the growth of the Order during the twelfth century. Although various dates are suggested for the year of its foundation, it can be safely attributed to have been founded in the last quarter of the twelfth century. It was to remain active for over three hundred and fifty years before the suppression of 1536 finally closed its doors on 27 August 1536. Later that century, the abbey's vast tracts of lands, including the immediate abbey environs, were sold into the hands of the Morgan family.(Ibid: 149) The landscape associated with the abbey stayed largely intact until the development of Cwmbran new town in 1949. After its dissolution in 1536, William Morgan of Pentrebach bought the property in 1554 and he later became a Member of Parliament (MP) and High Sheriff. The abbey may have been built by his son Edward Morgan, also an MP and High Sheriff, who was repeatedly fined for his recusancy. His son, Sir Edward Morgan, 1st Baronet was a noted Royalist during the Civil War. The second baronet, also Edward, sheltered the Jesuit priest who was executed at Usk in 1679, Saint David Lewis. The house was only intermittently occupied from then until it came into the hands of Reginald Blewitt. He rebuilt it in Tudor Revival style to the designs of Thomas Henry Wyatt in 1834‚Äì36. The renovation supposedly cost ¬£60,000 and that expense, coupled with the collapse of his finances, forced Blewitt into exile from 1851 to 1868. After his death a decade later, the nephew who inherited the property sold the abbey in 1895 to Sir Clifford Cory, colliery owner, shipping magnate and Liberal politician, who lived there until his death in 1941.Horace A. Laffaye, Polo in Britain: A History, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2012, p. 12 After his death, it became a depot for the American Army during the Second World War. In 1946 it became again a monastic institution, in the hands of the Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy. The main abbey building was Grade II* listed on 6 June 1962 \\"as an early and very elaborate Tudor revival country house.\\"Llantarnam Abbey, Llantarnam, britishlistedbuildings.co.uk. Historiography Llantarnam Abbey's first historical study of note was researched by Joseph Bradney in his multi-volume A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time. Bradney's work gives a detailed account of its setting within the landscape while giving as complete a historical account as possible through his available sources at the time. A lot of his work concentrated on the post medieval period including the pedigrees and heraldic coats of arms concerning the major families connected to the abbey. Also covered by Bradney are histories and observations on the granges and associated lands. These include Cwmbr√¢n, Pentre-bach, Ty Coch, St Dials and Llandderfel, with detailed notes on the parish church of St Michaels. The work is still used as a primary source by the Gwent Glamorgan Archaeological Trust when researching planning decisions on land associated with the abbey and its granges. In 1979 Sr Teresa Mahoney privately published ‚ÄòLlantarnam Abbey 800 years of History‚Äô. Historical records from Llantarnam Abbey and its granges are embellished with historical records from many other Cistercian sites around Britain and Europe. Compiled into a single volume, this culminates in an account which is probably the most complete history of the abbey that embraces an overall European Cistercian perspective. Although Mahoney's study takes into account the Welsh political problems that were associated with Llantarnam through its initial patronage, it also addresses the overall British situation that arose through the dissolution of the monasteries. The most prolific historian for the Llantarnam Abbey site itself is David H. Williams, who read as a historical geographer at Cambridge. After his initial 1964 article on Cistercian Abbots in Medieval Gwent, further publications included the work Llantarnam Abbey (1967); White Monks in Gwent and the Border; The Welsh Cistercians I & II; The Cistercians in the Middle Ages and Catalogue of Welsh Ecclesiastical Seals as known down to AD 1600; Atlas of Cistercian Lands in Wales; Catalogue of Welsh Ecclesiastical Seals in the National Museum of Wales I. Gwent Seals: VI. In 2001, both of Williams‚Äô 1984 volumes were published as one book. In contrast, research by Madeleine Gray has used a multi-disciplinary approach predominantly concentrating on the outlying granges on Mynydd Maen, Mynyddislwyn and the Rhondda valley. This included experimental archaeology, which retraced a long and arduous pilgrimage route from Llantarnam Abbey, through the granges of St Dials and Llandderfel, before arriving at Penrhys in the Rhondda; A post medieval survey of Henry the Earl of Pembroke's manor of Mynyddislwyn which includes many aspects of medieval land use deducted from the survey. Gray also examines the political situation in south Wales regarding the establishment of land endowment and the foundation of granges in south east Wales. Toponymy The study of the place-names relating to Llantarnam has resulted in general agreement across different studies, although there a few anomalies. Bradney proposes that Llantarnam has its origins in Nant Teyrnon and that Nant has evolved into Llan similar to Llancarfan (Nant Carfan) and Llanthony (Nant Honddu). From a c.1175 deed Bradney suggests that Emsanternon [was] ‚Äòdoubtless intended for‚Äô Ynys nant Teyrnon ‚Äì ‚Äòthe island by the brook of the Teyrnon‚Äô, while providing a footnote warning that ynys is often used for land situated next to a brook. The personal name Teyrnon, from the Mabinogion, is described as ‚Äòa Lord of Gwent Iscoed and the best man in the world‚Äô, while the translation of the full name, Teirnyon Twryf-Vliant is ‚ÄòTeyrnon of the rustling fine linen‚Äô. Lastly, Bradney mentions that the place name Ddeuma had been associated with the monastery being dedicated to St Deuma. This suggestion was mentioned in a footnote by the editor of a poem by Lewi Glyn Gothi to David ap Watking ap Henry. Although dismissing the possibility of a dedication to St Deuma for the monastery, Bradney suggests that the original dedication of the parish church may have been firstly dedicated to St Deuma before changing to St Michael at a later date. Osbourne and Hobbs' interpretation of Emsanternon suggests that it derives from the Welsh ynys for ‚Äòwater meadow‚Äô, nant ‚Äì ‚Äòvalley‚Äô which in turn evolved into meaning ‚Äòstream [running through the valley]‚Äô, and the personal name Teyrnon, an early ruler of Gwent. No interpretation of Deuma is proposed but the further place name Vallium, mentioned in 1244, is derived from the Latin for ‚Äòvalley‚Äô. Further toponymical work on some of Llantarnam's granges has been carried out by Osbourne and Hobbs (1999: 46-47; 2005: 22-24) and Osbourne (2008: 4-6). Morgan suggests Emsanternon as a mixture of both Bradney's and Osbourne and Hobbs understanding where Ynys is elevated to a ‚Äòraised area in a water-meadow‚Äô, while Teyrnon is reduced to Teyrn meaning ‚Äòprince‚Äô. Morgan points out that it was not until 1272 that the Latinised Lanterna was instructed to be used in the official lists by the Cistercian General Chapter rather than Vallium which had been recorded in 1244. Vallium is proposed as ‚Äòspurious‚Äô which could have been derived from a misinterpretation of Carlium [Caerleon]. Williams gives a comprehensive synopsis of the various place-names taking into account the recorded place- names that others have omitted.

Life and fame Sadig was born to a poor family of a watchman in Shusha. As a teenager, he took vocal lessons but lost his voice at the age of 18. He then took up pipe, kamancheh and eventually tar. By his mid-20s he was already a well-known tar player in South Caucasus and the neighbouring regions.

Axtar.az Developing the Azerbaijani tar During the early 1870s, Sadig used the traditional Persian tar to develop the new version of this instrument, which later became known as the Azerbaijani tar or the Caucasus tar. The Persian tar has 6 steel strings in 3 double-courses (the low one in octave). The Azerbaijani tar invented by Sadig has further one extra bass-string on the side, on a raised nut, and usually 2 double resonance strings via small metal nuts halfway the neck. All these strings are running next to the main strings over the bridge and are fixed to a string-holder and the edge of the body.Atlas of Plucked Instruments - Middle East Overall the Azerbaijani tar has 11 strings and 17 tones. Early tar players held the instrument to their knees. Sadig developed a new manner by reducing the size of the instrument, and for the first time presented the play on a tar nestled to the chest.

His feast day is observed on December 2. Name The name Nonnus was a Levantine one, with eight of the nine Nonni listed in the Acts of the councils of Chalcedon and Ephesus from that area. Some claim it to be a latinization or hellenization of an Egyptian title equivalent to \\"saint\\". Legend A hagiography of St Pelagia attributed to James or Jacob (), deacon of the church of Heliopolis (modern Baalbek), states that Nonnus was \\"a perfect monk\\" from Tabenna or \\"Tabennesum\\" in Egypt who, \\"by reason of his virtuous life\\", became bishop of Heliopolis, converting \\"all its inhabitants\\" and baptizing Arabs. A church council in Antioch was passed by the entourage of the town's most famous courtesan Margarita (\\"Pearl\\"), which caused Nonnus to condemn his audience and himself for taking less care of their souls than she had of her body. She appeared at his next Sunday sermon and Nonnus's sermon on hell prompted her to repent. She wrote him a letter and was permitted to see him with other witnesses; convinced of her sincerity, he took her confession and baptized her by her birth name Pelagia. After being pursued by the devil for a few days, she donated the property from her former employment to the church and lived with the deaconess Romana before departing for Jerusalem to disguise herself as a male hermit under the name Pelagi _us_. The story significantly omits dates and (on 8 occasions) the name of the archbishop under whom Nonnus served. History The historical St Pelagia ‚Äî mentioned by St AmbroseAmbrose, De Virg., III, 7, 33.Ambrose, Ep. xxxvii. ad Simplic. and in two sermons by John ChrysostomChrysostom, Hom. in Matth. lxvii. ‚Äî was an Antiochene virgin who committed suicide to avoid rape during the Diocletianic Persecution. St Marina ‚Äî the Latin equivalent of \\"Pelagius\\" ‚Äî was another bride who disguised herself as a monk to escape an unwanted marriage. Aspects of their stories were apparently combined with apocryphal accounts of Mary Magdalene, Biblical accounts of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and of Jesus and various women in the New Testament, and even with Greek myths regarding AphroditeHermann Usener to create the story of the harlot Pelagia. Chrysostom's sermon also mentions an anonymous (but apparently famous) actress and prostitute \\"from a wicked city in Phoenice\\" (possibly Heliopolis) who seduced \\"the empress's brother\\" but converted \\"in our own day\\". Constantius II's wife Eusebia had two brothers, Eusebius and Hypatius, joint consuls in 359, who both lived for many years in Antioch. In his account, attempts were made to lure her back to her former life by the Roman prefect and some of his soldiers, a role played by Satan in the hagiography. The mention of a meeting of the Syrian bishops is unhelpful for dating, as more than thirty Synods of Antioch were conducted in late antiquity. John of Ephesus records a persecution of Baalbek's pagans as late as 580 and no record apart from copies of Pelagia's hagiography lists a Nonnus as a bishop of Heliopolis, although his story is sometimes conflated with the Nonnus known to have been a bishop of Edessa in Mesopotamia and who attended the 451 Council of Chalcedon. This Nonnus has been further conflated with the contemporary poet Nonnus of Panopolis, but this is probably a mistake. Another Nonnus present at Chalcedon was the bishop of Zerabenna in Arabia, which lay under the jurisdiction of Antioch.

For this service the talent agency negotiates a packaging fee. Instead of collecting the usual 10% fee from individual clients, the agency receives the equivalent of 5% of what the studio or network pays the production company; 5% of half of any profit the production company earns; and 15% of adjusted gross (syndication revenue minus costs the network does not pay). Packaging can be much more lucrative for agencies than the usual 10% fee; in 1989 The New York Times reported that a major agency could earn $21,000 to $100,000 for each episode of a network show. Packaging is frequently done by the major talent agencies Creative Artists Agency, ICM Partners, United Talent Agency, and William Morris Endeavor. Although packaging has existed since the Golden Age of Radio, in the late 1970s Michael Ovitz of CAA was the first to package movies. WGA West estimated that 87% of TV shows were packaged during the 2016-2017 season. Packaging as a practice has been criticized by several writers, directors, and actors as inherently causing a major conflict of interest between the agency and its clients. In 2019, David Simon published a letter detailing how packaging incentivized his agents to work against his best interests on the deal for Homicide: Life on the Street. Simon's letter eventually led to a breakdown between the WGA and the Association of Talent Agents (ATA), the group representing the major agencies, when the sides were unable to negotiate a \\"Code Of Conduct\\" agreement that addressed the concerns of packaging, resulting in the mass firing of talent agents by all WGA members on April 15, 2019. On April 17, 2019, the two Writers Guild of America groups, WGA East and WGA West, sued the \\"big four\\" packaging agencies, claiming that packaging fees are an ‚Äúegregious conflict of interest‚Äù that ‚Äúconstitute unlawful kickbacks‚Äù from the studios to the agencies. The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against the four dominant Hollywood talent agencies: William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners. Approximately 95 percent of WGA members voted \\"in favor of a code of conduct that would cease packaging fees.\\" References Category:Film and video terminology Category:Film production Category:Product management ","title":"Movie packaging"},{"id":"9918651","text":"John Roundell Palmer, 4th Earl of Selborne (born 24 March 1940), is a British peer, ecological expert, and businessman.

Biography Born near Rignano sull'Arno, not far from Florence, he was chiefly a book merchant, or cartolaio, and had a share in the formation of many great libraries of the time. When Cosimo de' Medici wished to assemble the Laurentian Library of Florence, Vespasiano advised him, and sent him by Tommaso Parentucelli (later Pope Nicholas V) a systematic catalogue, which became the plan of the new collection. In twenty-two months Vespasiano had 200 volumes made for Cosimo by twenty-five copyists. Most of them were, as typical of the era, books of theology and liturgical chant. He had performed important services for the diffusion of classical authors when Nicholas V, the true founder of the Vatican Library, became pope. He devoted fourteen years to collecting the library of Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, organizing it in a more modern manner; it contained the catalogues of the Vatican, of San Marco, Florence, of the Visconti Library at Pavia, and Oxford. Vespasiano had a limited knowledge of Latin, and he is one of the few writers of the time who acknowledged it. Untrained as a writer, but with a discernment and intelligence in the appraisal of important figures, he left a collection of 300 biographies that is a major source of shrewd observation and reliable facts for the history of 15th-century humanism: Vite di uomini illustri del secolo XV.Published as Vite di uomini illustri del secolo XV by Ludovico Frati, Bologna, 1892-93; a translation was reprinted as The Vespasiano Memoirs: Lives of Illustrious Men of the XV Century (Renaissance Society of America Reprint Texts) 1997. He retired in 1480, disheartened by the advance of the printing press that was displacing the beautifully illuminated manuscripts that were his stock in trade and his love. He was not an erudite philosopher or historian such as Machiavelli and Guicciardini proved in the next generation, but he depicts the atmosphere of the period and its intellectual life. His accounts plunge the reader into the social world of Florence; they contain delicate pictures of manners, charming portraits, noble female figures, of which last point it is possible to judge by reading the biography of Alessandro Bardi (ed. Mai, 593). The general tone is that of a moralist, who shows the dangers of the Renaissance, especially for women, warns against the reading of the novels, and reproaches the Florentines with usury and illicit gains. Vespasiano is a panegyrist of Nicholas V, the great book-lover; he is severe to the point of injustice against Pope Callistus III, the indifferent lender of books, which, however, he did not give over to pillage, as Vespasiano accuses him of doing. His manuscripts, which he thought of as rough notes for a more polished series of Latin Vitae, remained unknown until they were discovered by Cardinal Angelo Mai, who first published them in 1839. A reading of them in Mai's edition in 1847 inspired Jacob Burckhardt to commence his magisterial Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860).Noted by Myron Gilmore, in his introduction to a 1963 edition of Bisticci by Harper Torchbooks, republished in 1997.

The Konwakiton is the most frequently visited of Shasta's glaciers, since the standard climbing route up Avalanche Gulch skirts along its western edge above Thumb Rock saddle, with the boot track often only a few feet (about a meter) from the bergschrund at the glacier's head. In 2002, scientists made the first detailed survey of Mount Shasta's glaciers in 50 years.

Early life and career The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Beutler, Sally Phipps was born Byrnece Beutler in Oakland, California on May 25, 1911. She attended Tamalpais High School and was a sales girl in a department store in San Francisco before she began acting. She was only three years old and the veteran winner of several beautiful baby contests when she appeared under the name Bernice Sawyer as the Baby in the film Broncho Billy And The Baby, made at the Niles, California, Essanay Studio in late 1914. She made two more Broncho Billy westerns there in early 1915, The Western Way and The Outlaw's Awakening. Fox studio gave her the name Sally Phipps in 1926, when she was 15. Until 1929, she was a Fox Film star who appeared in well over 20 films, including a cameo in F.W. Murnau's classic Sunrise. She was originally discovered by director Frank Borzage while still attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, California. She began her work at the studio starring in two-reel comedies. Her first was Light Wines And Bearded Ladies (1926). Other comedies, both in 1927, were Girls and Gentlemen Prefer Scotch. Her first role in a feature was in Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl (1926). Soon after, she was selected as one of the 13 1927 WAMPAS Baby Stars. Her first starring role in a feature was Love Makes 'Em Wild (1927). A May 4, 1927 review in the Appleton Post-Crescent complimented her skill as a performer in Love Makes 'Em Wild: > Miss Phipps is one of the most charming actresses we have had the privilege > of seeing in many a day. She has a personality which is distinctly > individual, to say the least, and flirts across the silver sheet with a > grace which would become an actress of many more years experience. In August 1927, she signed a five-year contract with Sol M. Wurtzel, personal secretary to William Fox. Fox sent Wurtzel to supervise West Coast productions for his studio in 1917. Phipps' Fox Film contract for October 1927 stipulated she was bound to the studio for a period of five years. She would be paid a starting wage of $125, which would rise to $600 a week for the last six months before expiration. Phipps starred in the very popular High School Hero, with leading man Nick Stuart, which opened in late 1927. She was also the female lead for the 1928 Fox features Why Sailors Go Wrong, News Parade, and None but the Brave. Her co-star for the first two films was Nick Stuart. The other co- starred Charles Morton. The News Parade is about the life of a Fox News cameraman and the daughter of a camera-shy millionaire. The motion picture was filmed in New York City, Lake Placid, New York, Palm Beach, Florida, and Havana, Cuba. Her last screen appearance at Fox was in the 1929 two-reel comedy talkie Detectives Wanted, starring Clark and McCullough. Two years later, she appeared on Broadway in the Kaufman and Hart comedy spoof of Hollywood, Once In A Lifetime (1930-1931), playing Susan Walker, the movie- struck ingenue. While on Broadway, she appeared as the female lead to Joe Penner in his 1931 Vitaphone two-reel comedy, Where Men Are Men. In it, she played Nancy Carter, a Western comedy vamp. In 1935, she again played a movie- struck ingenue in another Broadway comedy, Knock On Wood, by Allen Rivkin. Personal life On June 6, 1931, she married Gimbels department-store heir Benedict Gimbel Jr. (the grandson of Adam Gimbel and father of Ted Nathanson), and moved to Philadelphia; they divorced in 1935. In 1941, she married New York musician Alfred Marion Harned in Coyoacan, Mexico; they had two children, Maryanna and Robert, both born in Des Moines, Iowa; they divorced in 1956.  Death  Phipps died in Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, New York on March 17, 1978, at the age of 66.  Papers  In the summer of 2019, The Sally Phipps Archive was accepted into the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences in Hollywood, California. The Archive, now known as the ‚ÄúSally Phipps Papers‚Äù, consists of extensive pictorial material, including hundreds of scene stills from her films made at Fox, Essanay Niles, and Warner Brothers Vitaphone; from her two Broadway shows; publicity and pinup photos; and also 16mm prints of a couple of her films, lobby cards, posters, glass slides, theater programs, and heralds.

Culture La F√™te des Fleurs √† Beckfayya or the Festival of Flowers has attracted tourists since 1934 when Maurice Gemayel started the festival to attract attention to the mountainous town.

Church historian, the German historian Roehinger, proved that the Christian peoples‚Äîlater known as al-Marada‚Äîhave dwelled in this area and built BasKinta, Bikfaya, and Bhersaf starting around the year 679; a short time before building Ehden in north Lebanon. Historians mention as well that Bikfaya and Bhersaf were the headquarters of the Maronite Emirs and Bishops starting from the 7th Century A.D. and the most distinguished of these was Emir Semaan who resided in Bhersaf in the 11th century. The residents of the old Keserwan (which included at the time the Metn area and its surroundings) supported the Crusaders who remained in Lebanon from 1099 to 1291. When the Crusaders withdrew from their last strongholds, the Mamlukes led their first campaign in revenge under the leadership of prince Pedra in 1292 against the citizens of Keserwan who were diverse early on forming pockets of Shia Muslims and Maronites. However, the harsh mountains proved resistant to Mamluk soldiers who led a second campaign in 1293 which ended in the death of their leader and the slaughter of most of their soldiers. In retaliation, the Mamluk gathered an army of fifty thousand warriors and attacked Kesrwan in 1305. They destroyed villages, burned temples, cut trees and wiped out all traces of construction and killing everyone they could find. Only a few of the residents survived the onslaught and fled to the mountains of North Lebanon. As such, Bikfaya and its surroundings remained uninhabited until the 16th century. Bikfaya during the era of the Assafiyeen Emirs Feudalism in the Mamluk era was granted by the sultan in return for military services provided by individuals to the state. The Mamluk granted the Turkuman (known as Assafiyeen) control over the north (Lubnan Fi al-Tarikh- Dr Philip Hitty- Dar al ‚ÄìThakafa- Beirut, 1959) with the mission to safeguard the shoreline against intrusion by occidentals and early natives. The Assafiyeen inhabited areas they called after their notables and then moved to Ghazir. During the era of prince Mansour al-Assafy, with security spreading in the Kesrwan area, some members of the Bikfaya families‚Äîwho had survived in 1305‚Äîstarted to return to their hometown in 1540 (Sheikh Edmond Bleybel). It seems that prince Mansour decided to befriend the Christians after destroying the Shiites in his area who had plotted to kill him. The Gemayels came from Jaj in 1545 and met him. He honored them and granted them control over Bikfaya and its northern suburbs and sent them immediately to it. It is told that the Gemayels came to Bikfaya carrying the picture of Mar abda. With them came to Mhaidseh the Maalouf family and the two families became even closer when a member of the Maalouf family (today known as Klink) married the sister of father Antoun Gemayel and was blessed with two children, one of whom became a priest. In 1587 father Antoun sought to build a church in Bikfaya, so he donated one thousand Kobrosy to this cause. However, this sum was not enough and the number of inhabitants of Bikfaya was little, so father Antoun resorted to his brother-in-law and nephew for help and unified the efforts of the two towns and implemented his project next to an old oak tree. The tree is estimated to be around 1000 years old and its trunk still remains visible until our present day. Antoun set in the south-eastern side of the church an altar in the name of Mar Abda for the Maronites and another in the north‚Äìeastern side in the name of Our Lady for the Greek Orthodox (Bleybel). Dweihy says in his book: the history of the Maronites page 181 :‚Ä¶and in the year 1587 (996H) father Antoun of Gemayel family built the church of Mar Abda in the village of Bikfaya and had it illustrated by Elias al-Hasrouny. He spent on it 1000 Kobrosy in addition to donations by the residents of Bikfaya and other philanthropists‚Ä¶ then Patriarch Sarkis followed in the steps of his predecessors and raised father Antoun to Archbishop as a reward for his efforts. Historians believe that Bikfaya was the consecrated shrine of the Phoenician deity Baal.Bikfaya It was also the capital of the Christian Cancimat of Lebanon (1840‚Äì1860).

Biography Before becoming a professional musician, Fairweather was a librarian and has retained an interest in jazz bibliography and archiving. He led his first band, Dig's Half Dozen, in 1971 and recorded in 1973 with Alex Welsh. Four years later he was a member of the band Velvet with Ike Isaacs, Len Skeat, and Denny Wright, then a member of the Midnite Follies Orchestra and the Pizza Express All-Stars. In the early 1980s, he started a band that performed music by Nat Gonella. He worked as a sideman for George Chisholm, Alex Welsh, Tiny Winters, and Brian Priestley. In the 1980s and '90s he led the Jazz Superkings, the Great British Jazz Band, and the Half Dozen. During the 1990s he was a teacher, a broadcaster on BBC Radio and Jazz FM, and part of the Salute to Satchmo. Fairweather and Stan Barker started the Jazz College charity to introduce improvisation in schools. He established the Association of British Jazz Musicians and the National Jazz Foundation Archive. He wrote Jazz: The Essential Companion (1987) with Brian Priestly and Ian Carr. In 2000 it was renamed The Rough Guide to Jazz. Fairweather's musical style has been influenced by Louis Armstrong, Ruby Braff, Billy Butterfield, Bobby Hackett, Red Nichols, and Gonella. Digby's Half Dozen toured and recorded with singer George Melly in the later years of his career (2003‚Äì2007). Fairweather's band toured with singer Paul Jones in their presentation Rocking in Rhythm in 2007. Apart from his playing and group leading, Fairweather has long pursued a parallel career as a jazz broadcaster and writer. From 1985 to 1988, he worked and recorded with Brian Priestley's Special Septet and Tony Milliner's Mingus Music, and wrote the book How to Play Trumpet. By 1990 he had embarked on a dual vocation as broadcaster for BFBS, BBC World Service, Jazz FM (1991‚Äì92) and BBC Radios 2/3 (1992‚Äì98), including occasionally deputising for Humphrey Lyttelton on his show Best of Jazz and successively presenting Jazz Parade and Jazz Notes. In 2016, Fairweather founded The Jazz Centre (UK), a registered charity (no. 1167421) whose aim is to promote, preserve and celebrate the culture of jazz in all its forms.

Mrs. Strong offers hand-engraving to its clients. Mrs. Strong's bespoke products display a range of crafts which are rarely used by others in the industry, including hand engraving of dies in steel, hand-stamping of dies, hand-mixing of custom varnish inks, hand- beveling and bordering, and hand-lining of envelopes. Mrs. Strong creates its own 100% cotton archival quality papers in its signature color \\"Strong's Vanilla\\" based on Mrs. Strong's original formulas. History Mrs. John L. Strong (n√©e Flora Feldstein) established her eponymous firm in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929. Joining forces with her sister, the owner of a luxury trousseau shop called Bournefield Linens, Mrs. Strong began selling wedding and social papers to New York's elite from Bournefield's location at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Strong's business soon outstripped the space at Bournefield, and she moved her location twice, first to 714 Madison Avenue, and later to the landmark 699 Madison Avenue, originally built as a New York home for the firm Fortnum & Mason, where the firm remains with a fifth floor atelier for private clients and a duplex ground floor boutique. Mrs. Strong joined the \\"Street of Shops\\" on the first floor at Henri Bendel's in the 1950s. Mrs. Strong also sold through Gump's Department store in San Francisco. From her locations Mrs. Strong created papers for the Duke of Windsor and Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor, Barbara Hutton, the Rockefeller, Astor, Vanderbilt, and DuPont families, as well as Bette Davis, Diana Vreeland, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, Barbara Paley, and other icons of style. After the death of Mrs. Strong in 1979, the firm was sold by Strong's heirs to Robert and Joy Lewis.

It is a common native to the Eastern United States and Canada, widespread from Nova Scotia to Florida, west as far as Texas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Manitoba. It is also called agueweed, feverwort, or sweating-plant. It was introduced to American colonists by natives who used the plant for breaking fevers by means of heavy sweating. It is nearly always found in low, wet areas.  Description  E. perfoliatum can be recognized from its perfoliate leaves Eupatorium perfoliatum grows up to tall, with leaves that clasp the stems. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny white flower heads held above the foliage. Eupatorium perfoliatum can form hybrids with other species of the genus Eupatorium, for example Eupatorium serotinum. Phytochemistry and safety E. perfoliatum leaves and roots contain mixed phytochemicals, including polysaccharides (containing xylose and glucuronic acid), tannins, volatile oil, sesquiterpene lactones, sterols, triterpenes, alkaloids, and various flavonoids, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and caffeic acid derivatives. E. perfoliatum and several of its related species are listed on the Poisonous Plants Database of the US Food and Drug Administration, with E. perfoliatum described as an \\"unapproved homeopathic medicine\\" with unknown safety by the US National Library of Medicine. Holistic health companies marketing fraudulent supplement products that contained E. perforliatum with claims of benefit against COVID-19 were warned by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2020 about making illegal health claims and scamming consumers from their money. = Traditional medicine = Eupatorium perfoliatum (also called boneset) was used in traditional medicine by Native Americans who applied extracts for fever and common colds. Possible effects of E. perfoliatum for these uses remain undefined by adequate scientific research, and are unconfirmed by high-quality clinical research. If consumed in large amounts, its tea made from leaves may cause diarrhea.  Butterflies  Eupatorium perfoliatum is a specific butterfly food and habitat plant. It provides nectar for butterflies in the adult life cycle stage, particularly the white M hairstreak and the bronze copper butterfly.

Lee).Abbott, Dorothea E. \\"The Land of Maria Syphax and the Abbey Mausoleum.\\" Arlington Historical Magazine. October 1984, p. 64‚Äì79. The Spyhax family sold the land to John Dormoyle in 1901, who then sold it to Frederick Rice in 1924. Much of the rest of the land beneath Henderson Hall was part of the Arlington Estate as well. In 1941, the federal government built a temporary warehouse on this land, calling Federal Office Building No. 2.

A Headquarters and Service Company was organized on March 1, 1942, and a Women Marine Company (part of the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve) organized as part of the headquarters unit on April 1, 1943. To house both companies, the Marine Corps began acquiring, through purchase, easement, eminent domain, and other means, property to the west and northwest of the Navy Annex Building. This included most of the Syphax land, except for that already purchased by Abbey Mausoleum. Henderson Hall was built on this property in September 1943 to house both companies.

Characteristics The Essex, in its traditional form, was a smallish pig with 'pricked' ears and a black ground colour, with a broad band of white 'sheeting' across the shoulders. History Essex boar at the 1843 Royal Agricultural Show in Derby Like other old British pig breeds, the ancestor of the Essex may have originated in the county of the same name from selective breeding of local wild pigs. It was originally a smallish, \\"coarse\\" black-and- white pig that was noted for being easy to keep and cheap to feed, qualities that ensured its popularity with smallholders. The Old Essex, as it came to be known, was deliberately \\"improved\\" in the mid 19th century by crossing it with imported pigs.Wiseman, J. The pig: a British history, Duckworth, 2000, p.45 In the early nineteenth century, while travelling in Italy, Charles Western, 1st Baron Western obtained Neapolitan pigs to cross with his Essex sows. One of his tenants, Fisher Hobbs, bred the resulting Neapolitan-Essex boars with his \\"coarse\\" Essex sows and established the Improved Essex. In 1840 an Improved Essex boar and sow, both bred by Hobbs, each took first prize in its class at the second show of the Royal Agricultural Society at Cambridge. The Essex pig remained locally popular until as recently as the mid-1950s, and had actually increased in numbers during the Second World War and immediately afterwards, based on its reputation for hardiness and its ability to feed itself by foraging.The Decline of Traditional Breeds, British Pig Association, accessed 23 February 2010 In 1954, 488 Essex boars (2% of the total British stock) were still licensed, and 3,716 sows registered. The position of the Essex breed changed markedly after the publication of a 1955 report by the Advisory Committee on the Development of Pig Production in the United Kingdom, chaired by Sir Harold Howitt.Development of pig production in the United Kingdom: report of the Advisory Committee on Development of Pig Production in the United Kingdom, HMSO, 1955 The report, issued after the end of wartime rationing, expressed concern that the UK's pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European and Scandinavian pork and bacon producers, particularly those of Denmark, and identified that the wide variety of local breeds still used in the UK hampered development. It was therefore recommended that pig farmers concentrate on three breeds: the Welsh, the Landrace, and the Large White, and as a result the Essex pig went into a steep decline. While the breed societies of the Wessex (another breed featuring a black ground colour and white shoulder markings, although with a different origin) and Essex pigs had amalgamated as early as 1918, the formal end of the Essex pig came in 1967, when the stud books were also amalgamated with the intention of merging the two breeds into the British Saddleback. This was intended to improve the breed's characteristics, produce hybrid vigour, and prevent inbreeding in the remaining small herds. For many years the Essex pig was considered to have become extinct in 1967, although it was thought a few pure-bred individuals might survive on small farms. Re-creation of the breed Later research showed that one farmer, John Croshaw, had refused to amalgamate his herd of Essex pigs (the \\"Glascote Herd\\"), which retained a pure Essex bloodline despite being officially registered as British Saddlebacks: Croshaw had carefully managed his stock to avoid inbreeding.Essex Pig Society , accessed 23 February 2010 The Essex Pig Society was formed in 1997, and since that time Jimmy Doherty and Michaela Furney of Jimmy's Farm have made further efforts to publicise and re-establish the breed.

The film features Ignacio Toselli as Hern√°n, Mariana Anghileri as Pato, and Oscar Nu√±ez as Venancio, Pato's manipulative father, among others.. The film was partly funded by INCAA. Plot This black comedy is about average people who live in Gonz√°lez Cat√°n, a working-class suburb southwest of Buenos Aires, and are having a hard time making a living. In the beginning, Hern√°n helps his brother and his wife get ready for a their big move to Spain. His parents are forced to leave Argentina in order to escape the ravages of the country's economic crisis. Hern√°n is left alone in the Buenos Aires suburbs. He works at an agency delivering messages on a small motorcycle. One day, at a gas station, he meets Pato, an attractive woman working the pumps. Hern√°n invites Pato to rent the room his brother vacated. Pato is a mysterious young woman. She realizes Hern√°n likes her and she decides to go along in returning his advances. Yet, Hern√°n is quite surprised when he comes home one night. Pato's parents and her young daughter have moved in without giving Hern√°n a warning. The father, Venancio (Oscar Nu√±ez), a slick character, thanks Hern√°n, who thinks the move-in is temporary. However, it seems that Pato's parents have come to stay. Dispossession laws in Argentina can be quite lengthy and costly. Venancio and his wife turn the kitchen into a small bakery making churros that are sold on the streets. Nothing that Hern√°n does to get rid of Pato's family who occupy the house. That is until he takes matters into his own hands and scares Pato's family. Pato, who is not able to have a relationship with Hern√°n, is being pursued by a handsome young man, Jose Luis, a client at the gas station. Pato realizes her chance when she discovers that Jose Luis is much wealthier than Hern√°n. Venancio, his wife, and the young girl appear at Jose Luis' building. In the next scene, Venancio is seated at the dinner table thanking Jose Luis with the same speech he used to thank Hern√°n.

Critical reception Deborah Young, film critic for Variety magazine and reporting from the International Film Festival Rotterdam, liked the film and wrote, \\"Argentina's economic crisis furnishes fertile background material in Buena Vida (Delivery), a clever social drama spiked with black humor...Well-written and acted, pic vividly conveys the country's dire straits with clenched-teeth humor and compassion for all. It should benefit from the growing aud for Argentine product...From a low-key naturalistic drama, pic turns into an ironic comedy that catches the viewer up in seemingly unsolvable social and personal problems.\\"Young, Deborah. Variety, February 19, 2004. Last accessed: February 17, 2008. Film critic Ed Gonzalez, who writes for Slant Magazine, liked the film and the way director Leonardo Di Cesare approached the material and wrote, \\"Nostalgia sweetly and sensitively tinges the sobering film's emotional politics, as it does in Leonardo Di Cesare's Buena Vida Delivery, the story of a female gas station employee, Pato (Mariana Anghileri), who moves in with a young man, Hern√°n (Ignacio Toseli), whose parents leave Argentina in order to escape the ravages of the country's economic crisis. Infinitely more charming than Daniel Burman's self-obsessed Lost Embrace, the film is a romantic comedy that accommodates the dejected mood of the country's people...where Lost Embrace worried only for its main character, Buena Vida frets for an entire nation.\\"Gonzalez, Ed. Slant, film review, 2005. British film critic K.H. Brown liked considered the film deeply ironic and wrote, \\"Making black comedy out of national economic disaster, the title of this Argentine drama can only be understood as deeply ironic. No one is being delivered a particularly good life. Rather, everyone is struggling to get by, doing what they feel is best for them and theirs...Straightforward, unflashy direction ‚Äì one suddenly notices the previous absence of music when a few ominous chords signal the beginning of act three, for instance ‚Äì is counterbalanced by well-observed and nuanced performances and a satisfactorily bittersweet resolution. If Buena Vida Delivery probably won't put film-maker Leonardo Di Cesare up there with the likes of Walter Salles and Gonzales Innaritu at the forefront of current Latin American cinema, it's a pleasing enough way to spend 90 minutes.\\"Brown, K.H.

Synopsis The film's plot alternates between two stories, both set in the drought-stricken sert√£o of Northeastern Brazil in 1963. In one storyline a holy man urges a group of peasant pilgrims to follow an ox deemed as sacred in hopes that their devotion to it will bring an end to the drought. The other storyline follows a group of soldiers who are sent to the region to thwart the attempts of impoverished civilians to plunder a storehouse for food owned by the wealthy mayor of the small town of Milagres, Bahia. Guerra filmed The Guns in a triptych of styles. The pilgrims appear as an anonymous mass in their devotion to their project, while the hungry peasants are given a more documentarian treatment. By contrast, the soldiers are more individuated, with long swaths of time devoted to showing their boredom in their task at hand. One soldier, Mario, becomes smitten with a young woman named Luisa who is reluctant to return his affection because she does not trust the soldiers. Meanwhile a hotheaded soldier named Pedro shoots and kills a local peasant while he was out walking with his goat, after which he and his fellow soldiers cover up the incident to avoid persecution. Tensions come to a head when the charismatic truck driver and former soldier named Gaucho becomes frustrated by the peasants' inability to change their situation. After he sees a father reacted apathetically to death of his child from hunger, Gaucho takes up arms and engages in a firefight with the occupying soldiers who eventually kill him. In the end, the peasants assuage their hunger by defying the holy man and slaughtering and eating the sacred ox. Production Director Ruy Guerra originally conceived on the story in 1958 and planned to film it in Greece with a plot revolving around a band of soldiers trying to defend a village from a pack of hungry wolves because a government ordinance prohibits the villagers from carrying firearms for fear of popular revolt. In Guerra's original story, tensions between the villagers and the visiting soldiers escalate into conflict, and a soldier kills one of the locals. In the end, the villagers drive the soldiers out, leaving themselves vulnerable to attack from the wolves in the surrounding forest. This version of \\"The Guns\\" was never made because Greek officials denied Guerra permits to shoot it. Guerra enlisted the help of his friend Miguel Torres to reconfigure the story, and in 1964 Guerra produced The Guns, filming it in the northeastern state of Bahia and adapting its screenplay to incorporate elements of Brazilian culture. Both story lines were generated out of an incident that occurred in 1924 when a group of soldiers shot and killed a sacred ox. Though Guerra had a firmly defined structure for the film's plot, he used a good deal of improvisation on set depending on what and who was on hand. Reception The Guns was entered into the 14th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize. The New York Times called it \\"exceptionally good\\". Legacy Along with N√©lson Pereira dos Santos' 1963 drama,Vidas Secas (\\"Barren Lives\\"), and Glauber Rocha's 1964 film Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (known in English as \\"Black God, White Devil\\"), The Guns is part of Brazil's \\"Golden Trilogy\\" of Cinema Novo and regarded as one of the key films that brought worldwide attention to Brazilian cinema.Ruy Guerra - A autenticidade do cinema brasileiro, acesso em 31 de julho de 2016.Os Fuzis, de Ruy Guerra A Hora e a Vez de Augusto Matraga, de Roberto Santos, acesso em 30 de julho de 2016.

He was born in Cremona. Called to Spain in 1529 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he was appointed Court Clock Master and built the Cristalino, an astronomical clock that made him famous in his time. Philip II of Spain named him Matem√°tico Mayor. He worked and lived in Toledo, where he built the Artificio de Juanelo, an engine that, driven by the river itself, lifted water from the Tagus to a height of almost 100 meters, to supply the city and its castle (Alc√°zar). Turriano is attributed as the creator of the \\"Clockwork Prayer\\", an automaton representing a monk manufactured in the 1560s based on a commission from Philip II of Spain. Following the recovery of his son, and in the belief that Didacus of Alcal√° had in some way intervened on his behalf, King Philip II of Spain commissioned Juanelo Turriano, mechanic to Emperor Charles V, to build a clockwork model of Didacus. The model would perform a number of set actions, including the beating of the breast which accompanies the Mea culpa prayer. An automaton of similar age, functions, and appearance is in the collections of the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution]. Another automaton associated with Turriano is a figure of a lady playing a lute housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. He died at Toledo in 1585.  Bibliography  * Zanetti, Cristiano.

They were discovered by Shintaro Suzuki's group, when they used PCR to find new members of the cadherin family. The PCR fragments that corresponded to Protocadherins were found in vertebrate and invertebrate species. This prevalence in a wide range of species suggested that the fragments were part of an ancient cadherin and were thus termed \\"Protocadherins\\" as the \\"first cadherins\\". Of the approximately 70 Pcdh genes identified in mammalian genomes, over 50 are located in tightly linked gene clusters on the same chromosome. Until recently, it was assumed that this kind of organization can only be found in vertebrates, but Octopus bimaculoides has 168 genes of which nearly three- quarters are found in tandem clusters with the two largest clusters compromising 31 and 17 genes, respectively.  Classification  In mammals, two types of Pcdh genes have been defined: the non-clustered Pcdhs which are scattered throughout the genome; and the clustered Pcdhs organized in three gene clusters designated Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ which in mouse genome comprises 14, 22 and 22, respectively, large variable exons arrayed in tandem. Each exon is transcribed from its owner promoter and encodes: the entire extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short and variable intracellular domain of the corresponding Pcdh protein which differs from the Cadherin intracellular domain due to lack of attachment to the cytoskeleton through catenins. Moreover, these clustered Pcdh genes are predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system and since different subsets of Pcdhs genes are differentially expressed in individual neurons, a vast cell surface diversity may arise from this combinatorial expression. This has led to speculation and further to the proposal that Pcdhs may provide a synaptic-address code for neuronal connectivity or a single-cell barcode for self-recognition/self- avoidance similar to that ascribed to DSCAM proteins of invertebrates. Although vertebrate DSCAMs lack the diversity of their invertebrate counterparts, the selective transcription of individual Pcdh isoforms can be achieved by promoter choice followed by alternative pre-mRNA cis-splicing thus increasing the number of possible combinations.  Function  =Homophilic interactions and intracellular signaling= Clustered Pcdhs proteins are detected throughout the neuronal soma, dendrites and axons and are observed in synapses and growth cones. Like classical cadherins, members of Pcdhs family were also shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion in cell-based assays and most of them showed to engage in homophilic trans-interactions. Schreiner and Weiner showed that PcdhŒ± and Œ≥ proteins can form multimeric complexes. If all three classes of Pcdhs could engage in multimerization of stochastically expressed Pcdhs isoforms, then neurons could produce a large number of distinct homophilic interaction units, amplifying significantly the cell-surface diversity more than the one afforded by stochastic gene expression alone. As for cytoplasmic domain, all the three classes of clustered Pcdhs proteins are dissimilar, although they are strictly conserved in vertebrate evolution, suggesting a conserved cellular function. This is corroborated by a large number of other interacting proteins including phosphatases, kinases, adhesion molecules and synaptic proteins The cytoplasmic domain also mediates intracellular retention, a property which distinguishes the clustered protocadherins from the related classical cadherins. Furthermore, it was shown that Pcdhs are proteolytically processed by Œ≥-secretase complex, which releases soluble intracellular fragments into the cytoplasm which might have a broad range of functions as acting locally in the cytoplasm and/or even regulate gene expression similarly to other cell-surface proteins such as Notch and N-cadherin. Since these molecules are involved in so many developmental processes like axon guidance and dendrite arborization, mutations in Pcdhs genes and their expression may play a role in Down, Rett as well as Fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases The cytoplasmic domain of Pcdh-alpha can be divided into two specific types. Both of them enhance homophilic interactions. They associate with neurofillament M and fascin respectively.

She was particularly notable in the sub-genre known as girls with guns. Biography From age 6 to 12, Lee lived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan with her father, who had business there. She attended Youchang Elementary School. During her stay in Taiwan, she learned Mandarin Chinese and developed her piano and dancing expertise. As a result, she often had performances. When Lee first returned to Hong Kong to attend middle school, her Cantonese was not perfect and she was sort of rustic. At age 15, Lee was accidentally discovered by a television director, , during a school dancing performance. She was recommended to play a role in a television series Fatherland. Since the series did not require too much of her time and she could still study at school, her parents agreed to let her act. In the series, she was a country girl by the name of A Mun, who looked just like Lee. Ever since then, people liked to call her A Mun. Her performance in the series was so impressive that she began her career as an actress. Since she has been practicing dances from her childhood, it was easy for her to perform action movies with her agile and flexible movements. After her first martial arts movie in ancient costumes (Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain), she has not left the stage of action movies. At 18, after graduating from high school, Lee signed contracts with both Asia Television and Golden Harvest. When she was sent to Japan to make an advertisement for Mitsubishi, the company asked her to pick an English name, and she chose \\"Moon\\" as the pronunciation of Mun in Cantonese is close to the English word, Moon. She played in many television series, exceeding 400 episodes. Subsequently, she focused her efforts wholly on movies, mostly action movies. In the late 1990s, she gradually left the movie field and was passionately involved in the promotion of the art of dance and established a dancing school to cultivate talented dancers. Her students won excellence awards in Hong Kong dance competitions. Stunt accident While performing the final stunt in Devil Hunters (1989), Lee sustained a third degree burn. Lee was supposed to jump off a window from a second story building to evade an explosion. Due to bad timing by the pyrotechnicians, she was engulfed in flames before she jumped down, resulting in severe burns to her hands and face. The epilogue of the film accounts the details about the accident, along with a message of commendation from the director for her courage and hardwork.Áç®ÂÆ∂ÂÖ¨ÈñãË¢´ÁÇ∏ÂÇ∑ÁúüÈù¢ÁõÆ Filmography =Films= * To Sir with Troubles ‰∫§ÂèâÈõ∂Ëõã (1981) * Winners and Sinners a.k.a. 5 Lucky Stars Â•áË∞ãÂ¶ôËÆ°‰∫îÁ¶èÊòü (1983) * The Champions a.k.a.

On 1 January 1976 the aircraft operating the flight was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 81 people on board. The bombers were never identified.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a Boeing 720-023B (serial number 18020 and serial 165). Its first flight was on 23 September 1960. The aircraft was registered as N7534A and was delivered to American Airlines on 10 October the same year and received flight number 534. In July 1971, American Airlines sold the aircraft for repair. On 3 March 1972, the aircraft was sold to Middle East Airlines where it was re-registered as OD-AFT. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney JT3D-1-MC7 turbofan engines with water cooling and a thrust of 17,000 pounds each.  Bombing  Flight ME438 was an international passenger flight from Beirut, Lebanon to Muscat, Oman, with a stopover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With 15 crew members and 66 passengers (other sources stated that there were 67 passengers) on board, flight 438 departed from Beirut. In the predawn twilight, the airliner was en route from Beirut to Dubai when at 05:30, 1 hour and 40 minutes after departure, a bomb exploded in the front section of the cargo hold. The aircraft broke up at an altitude of and crashed 37 km (23 mi) northwest of Al Qaysumah, Saudi Arabia. The crash was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Saudi Arabia at the time, and is now the sixth-deadliest. It is also the second-deadliest aviation disaster involving the Boeing 720, behind Pakistan International Airlines Flight 705.  Investigation  According to several reports, the bomb was planted on board by Omani militants. At the same time, the bomb timer was set so that the bomb exploded after landing at Muscat airport, that is, the killing of passengers was not the goal of the militants. Flight 438 was originally going to be operated using a Boeing 747, but a technical malfunction was revealed, requiring the Boeing 720 to be used instead. Boarding and baggage loading delayed the flight, causing the bomb to explode early while the aircraft was still cruising.

History Sialkot became a part of the Muslim Sultanate of Delhi when the Afghan noble Sultan Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Ghauri conquered Punjab in 1185. He was unable to conquer Lahore but left a garrison in Sialkot. Later, Sultan Khusro Malik tried to capture the city but failed to do so. Sialkot then became a part of the Muslim Mughal Empire which was of Central Asian origin. The Mughal commander, Usman Ghani Raza, advanced towards Delhi by way of Sialkot which capitulated to his armies. In 'Babur Nama', Zaheer-ud-Din Muhammad Babur records: During the era of the Mughal Emperor, Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar, the present district of Sialkot formed a part of the Rachna-Bar Sarkar of the Lahore province. Under the reign of the Mughal Emperor, Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Shah Jahan, Ali Mardan Khan held the charge of Sialkot. At the end of the Mughal dynasty, the suburbs and the outlying districts and areas of Sialkot were left to themselves. Sialkot, itself, was appropriated by powerful families of Pashtuns from Multan, Afghanistan and Swat, the Kakayzai and Sherwani, and another family from Quetta. In 1748, the four districts of Gujrat, Sialkot, Pasrur and Daska were given to the Afghan Pashtun ruler, Ahmed Shah Durrani, and the area was amalgamated into the Afghan empire. After 1751, Ahmed Shah Durrani left his son, Taimur, to rule Lahore and these districts. During that time, Raja Ranjit Deo of Jammu expanded his domination over the peripheral areas, but the city of Sialkot was not included in it. Afterwards, the city was held strongly by a Pashtun clan till the occupation of the Sikhs who ruled for a period of about 40 years. The Pashtun presence is still considerable to this day and continues to attract newer Pashtun migrants and workers from Pakistan's tribal areas. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied Sialkot. The Muslims faced restrictions during the Sikh rule.

He is credited with providing an impetus to the revival of literary Latin, and is characterized as an early humanist. He was influenced by his teacher, the Paduan poet and proto-humanist Lovato Lovati. Mussato influenced many humanists such as Petrarch. A native of Padua and a member of its council, Mussato acted as an ambassador between Padua and Emperor Henry VII.\\"Albertino Mussato\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 1 March 2015. He is a member of a group of Latin Paduan poets called the cenacolo padovano. Mussato is renowned for his Latin play Ecerinis,Also rendered Eccerinus or Eccerinis which was based on the tyrannical career of Ezzelino III da Romano. It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times. Thus, it is considered to be the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work.Neoclassic Critics Ecerinis is not only significant for its historical information, but is modeled after the Senecan tragedy and is an indication of the early revival of classical works and their form ‚Äì a characteristic of the humanist movement. Mussato received the poet laureate honour as a result of the literary and political qualities of his play. He was one of the first to receive this designation after the classical age.Concetta Carestia Greenfield, Humanist and Scholastic Poetics, 1250‚Äì1500. (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1981), 79. Mussato's other works are a corpus of letters, poetry, and historical works including a chronicle of Henry VII's actions in Italy. In addition to his prolific writings, he was also a champion of poetry which he defended in a 1317 polemical exchange of letters with a Dominican friar, Giovannino of Mantua.Patricia Zupan, \\"Dante's Ulysses: Toward Recovering A Primordial Language\\" Biography =Youth and early career= Albertino Mussato was born in Padua in 1261 in the district of Gazzo, at around the time of year when the grapes are harvestedMarino Zabbia, \\"Mussato, Albertino,\\" Treccani L'Enciclopedia Italiana. Istituto Dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 2012. 28 February 2015. http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato_(Dizionario- Biografico)/. ‚Äî which is typically between September and November.\\"Veneto\\" Banfi Wines, 21 March 2015. http://www.banfiwines.com/region/italy/veneto/. Much of the information on Mussato's life is chronicled in his autobiographical poem written in 1317: De Celebratione Suae Diei Nativitatis Fienda Vel Non (Whether His Birthday Ought to Be Celebrated or Not). He is the oldest of his siblings, having two younger brothers and one younger sister. His father was Giovanni Cavalieri, a court messenger, but there were rumours that Mussato is the illegitimate son of an adulterous union between Viviano Muso and Cavalieri's wife. These rumours arose because Mussato adopted the last name Muso in his early years, probably, though, as tribute to Viviano Muso, who provided protection to the Cavalieri family and stood as godfather to Mussato. By 1276‚Äì7 Viviano Muso had died leaving Mussato and his family in a state of poverty. The responsibility of providing for the family came to rest upon Mussato and he became employed in book copying for students. Later on he transitioned to working in the Paduan law courts with his first notarial document being done for Amerina Muso ‚Äì Viviano Muso's widow. However, he lacked a formal education and was unable to become a judge and was confined to remain a notary. Around this time, it is possible that Mussato began his tutorship under Lovato Lovati. Throughout the 1280s and 1290s Mussato continued his notary work, eventually receiving recognition and prestige for performing all his notarial duties with great ability. However, he himself remarks in De Celebratione that he felt he did not deserve such praises. Nevertheless, due to his recognition, Mussato was knighted and became a member of the Consiglio Maggiore of Padua and was nominated to become a miles pro commune in 1296, at the young age of 35. In 1294, he married Mabilia Lemici, daughter of Guglielmo Dente Lemici (or illegitimate daughter according to Giovanni da Nono). He eventually moved to the area where the Lemici Palazzo was located and he became the legal guardian of Guglielmo II when Vitaliano, son of Guglielmo Lemici, died in 1310. =Padua and diplomacy= Ambassador to Boniface VIII Mussato first known role in politics was in 1297 when he became Podest√† of Lendinara. But his first notable role in politics was around the year 1300 and his first mission was as an ambassador to Pope Boniface VIII, most likely to try and influence the Pope to control the Inquisition that was happening in Padua at the time. During Mussato's mission to Pope Boniface VIII the previous abbot of Santa Giustina, Renaldo, died resulting in a disputed election for the ecclesiastical position. Mussato used his time as ambassador to Boniface to influence his decision over the election by promoting his brother, Gualpertino, for the role. Vitaliano Lemici, simultaneously, spent a fortune in promoting Gualpertino for the position. The issue was finally resolved on February 17, 1300, when Boniface announced in a letter that Gualpertino was the new abbot of Santa Giustina. In April 1301 Mussato was sent to Florence as Esecutore degli Ordinamenti di Giustizia (Executor of Judicial Ordinances) for a period of 6 months. Ambassador to Henry VII Mussato was later sent on four ambassadorial missions to Henry VII. On the first mission Mussato travelled as part of the Paduan representatives to the coronation of Henry VII in Milan in early January 1311. On his second journey to the Henry VII Mussato was assigned as chief ambassador and tasked with negotiating the independence of Padua. Certain conditions were placed before Padua as part of the negotiations: Padua was to have an Imperial Vicar, replacing the city's Podest√† and to be nominated by the Emperor himself; Padua was also required to make occasional monetary tributes to the Emperor and his imperial court. However the Paduans were upset with these conditions and fearful of the favour given to Cangrande della Scala of Verona during these meetings, whom they saw as being the next Ezzelino III da Romano. The Paduans rejected these conditions and rallied the city into a state of defence. Vicenza, which had been under Paduan dominion for some time, took this opportunity to ally with della Scala and break free from Paduan supremacy on April 15. Fearing for their independence and possible retribution by the Emperor the Paduans decided that the conditions presented to them were favourable and again sent Mussato and colleagues to meet with the Emperor resulting in compensation for those who suffered private losses in the Vicentini revolt and Padua officially attaching itself to the Holy Roman Empire on June 16, 1311. Mussato's last ambassadorial mission to Henry was to resolve the issue of property disputes between the Paduans and the Vicentini but he soon left the camp of the Emperor with only a rescript regarding the matter due to the Emperor's campaign to Rome stalled and continued to drag on with no end in sight. =Exile and death= In April 1314 there was a violent uprising against the rulers of Padua and Mussato was forced to flee to the village of Vigodarzere, but he was soon reconciled and allowed to return. Mussato wrote at the time that the conflict was between the Carraresi and the Altichini, however Giacomo da Carrara wrote to a nearby commune that the conflict was between him and Mussato. Mussato was later exiled in the spring of 1318 when Niccol√≤ da Carrara attacked Gualpertino. Gualpertino fled first to the Lemici palazzo and then to the castle of Treville with his brother, Mussato, where a better chance for security was offered. Mussato was banished permanently in 1325 by the Carrara family and died four years later in Chioggia on the 31 May at the age of 68. Politics =Ideological development= As he grew older Mussato's political stature grew substantially, not only with his fellow Paduans, but also with many individuals across Italy, and more specifically his peers. Often viewed as a patriot, Mussato was a prominent pre-humanist, who, fearing tyranny preferred a republic and became an influential political writer in his later adulthood. Born in Padua, Mussato was greatly influenced by his mentor and fellow Paduan Lovato Lovati. Lovati was influential in creating Mussato's political ideals that were based upon Lovati's personal experiences he built while living in Padua throughout Ezzelino da Romano's tyrannical reign as the leader of Padua. These experiences greatly affected Lovati's perspective, which in turn influenced Mussato to express his personal opinion on signorial monarchies. Through the teachings of Lovati, Mussato played a major role in influencing his friend Marsilius of Padua, the political philosopher. During Mussato's time in Padua he and his peers gathered regularly to discuss their ideals and help to spread the word of the humanists across Italy. This helped to solidify humanism as an important moral and political system in Padua and many other regions of Northern Italy during the early 14th century. Upon retiring from his legal career as a lawyer, Mussato began to focus on political life. He held multiple positions in the Paduan government and eventually served in the Consiglio Maggional (great council) of Padua. Mussato was also involved in numerous other diplomatic missions during his time in government as well as a part of multiple delegations for the city of Padua including the coronation of Henry VIII in Milan in 1312. =Mussato and contemporaries= Mussato, drew upon fellow scholars from across Italy to dissect multiple opinions and carve out his own political perspective. As Mussato developed his political agenda his writings became more politically driven, which increased his ability to persuade his fellow scholars to follow his beliefs. Mussato, along with a number of other political writers expressed a great deal of doubt in signorial monarchies during their regular council meetings. More than half a century after Ezzelino da Romano's reign ended, Mussato and other peers associated with pre-humanism still feared the threat of another potential tyrant in Cangrande della Scala and attempted to save the communal government of Padua. Mussato repeatedly equated the attempts of his fellow citizens to uphold their \\"res publica\\"(republic) in defense of liberty of their community against the challenge the della Scala family presented. =Political effects of his works= Mussato produced many works over his career including multiple pieces on influential people in his life (Lovati, Marsilius). He wrote various historiographical works with subtle political influence (e.g. Augusta de Gestis de Henrici VII), and incorporated political tragedies from the past (Seneca) to further cement his political arsenal. All of the works created by Mussato were minor in their political efforts in comparison to Ecerinis. After gaining inspiration from his incarceration, experiences and previous writings, he wrote Ecerinis. The most famous of Mussato's works contained writings of immense political magnitude that targeted Cangrande and angered the della Scala family. The remarks in Ecerenis eventually brought about Mussato's exile in 1325. Ecerinis was viewed as a clever means to undermine Cangrande and was actually quite successful at reaching its goal. Mussato's use of politically biased information is exemplified in Ecerinis when the messenger returns with the news of Ezzelino's gruesome death. This garners the following response from the Chorus: ::Young men, together let us pay thanks befitting the giver of such great blessings‚Ä¶. :: May God, born of a Virgin, show his approval to the vows have addressed to him.Albertino Mussato. The Tragedy of Ecerinis, trans. R.W Carruba et al (University Park: Penn. State University Press, 1972 (Studia Classica, 1) ll. 521-22, 535‚Äì36. This statement clearly uses his death to vilify Ezzelino and warn citizens of Padua to avoid letting tyranny return with Cangrande. The whole structure of Ecerinis left little doubt of its political approach through the vilification of Ezzelino as a typical tyrant.Mussato. The Tragedy of Ecerinis,ll. 521-22, 535‚Äì36 Mussato's efforts came to fruition in that \\"the myth of Ezzelino\\" was created from his work and was used as a way to denounce Padua's seigniorial past. Mussato also used Ecerinis to express the desperation he faced in preserving communal rule in Padua. The play used many real life experiences to point to the dangerous effects of seigniorial rule on a city and foreshadowed the collapse of civic liberty in Padua. This was an attempt to inspire Paduans to stand up for their republic and regain the civic liberty they had lost. Ecerinis was also used as a warning to Cangrande to inform him that all tyrannical reigns end in death and ruin which will cause mass suffering for a variety of reasons. =Political consequences and political legacy= Ecerinis created a political legacy for Mussato that greatly benefited the longevity and importance of his works but also led to the undoing of his personal life. In 1318 Mussato was once again incarcerated for complaining about the loss of Padua's communal government and his political antics against the Carrara family after Giacoma da Carrara was named the delegate of the people in July 1318. Albertino Mussato was later exiled in 1325 where he continued to write pieces with subtle political messages. These works included Ludovicus Bavarius, ad Filium, a letter addressed Louis of Bavaria that dealt with the education of his son. The last works of Mussato exemplified his efforts to share his personal knowledge and beliefs with subtle political hints wherever applicable to as many individuals as possible. In 1329 Mussato died while in exile but not without affecting the lives of many Italians. He left behind a vast multifaceted literary and historical library with a strong political intent. Early humanism =Pre-humanism defined= Petrarch is popularly defined as the first humanist, however, figures such as Albertino Mussato, and his teacher Lovato Lovati are argued by many scholars to have preceded Petrarchan humanism in their use of classical works. Humanism, or \\"pre-humanism\\", began in Padua in the 1260s with Lovati modeling poems based on Ovid and Horace, followed by his pupil, Mussato, classicizing prose and modeling his play, Ecerinis, after the Senecan tragedy. The interest in classical works by the Northern Italians, is argued by Nicholas Mann to originate in the study of Roman Law, the Corpus Juris Civilis. Northern Italian early humanists, such as Lovati and Mussato, were often lawyers, and applied Roman law to contemporary legal situations. The lawyers studying these ancient Roman legal texts also became interested in other aspects of classical heritage: history and moral philosophy. The main interests of early humanists, such as Lovati and Mussato, did not lie in advocating for an emulation of historical Greece or Rome, but in the mythical worlds of Gods and heroes of classical Latin poetry. The early humanists did not have as romanticized a view of the superiority and glory of ancient societies, like later humanists such as Petrarch, as their works predominantly attempted to evoke the emotions and thoughts of ancient society. This is especially seen in Mussato's tragic play, Ecerinis, based on the Senecan tragedy. Overall, Lovati and Mussato contribute to features of later humanism, such as: the rejection of contemporary Latin, the appetite for classical texts, and the desire to both ascertain their meaning and imitate them. Later humanists, such as Petrarch and Dante are argued to be indebted to the works of the early Northern Italian humanists such as Lovati and Mussato. =Lovati and influence= Mussato was influenced by his teacher and contemporary, Lovato Lovati, a figure also associated with Northern Italian humanism. Lovati was one of the first to demonstrate \\"proto-humanism\\" and is known for the discovery of Seneca's plays as well as familiarity with ancient lyric poets such as Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius. Later, Lovati's knowledge of classical works and figures would be highly praised by Petrarch, the \\"father of humanism\\". Connecting Lovati's influence to Mussato, lies in Mussato's most well known work, his play Ecerinis. Ecerinis was modeled after the Senecan tragedy unearthed by Lovati, showing that Lovati and Mussato were close contemporaries as well as sharing a student teacher relationship. They even made sobriquets, or nicknames for each other, which was also part of classical tradition. Lovati's was \\"Wolf\\", and Mussato's, \\"Little ass\\". Lovati believed Mussato showed great promise, as on his death bed, he told Mussato to put his poetic interests above his family, saying \\"since you are deemed gifted by the muses, by these you will be muse inspired. Ivy will circle your temples\\". =Classical influence in works= Mussato's most well known play, Ecerinis, was written in 1314. Modeled after the Senecan tragedy, as well as the first play to be composed in a classical metre since antiquity, it was the first tragic drama to emerge after Lovati unearthed Seneca's plays. The play was based specifically on the Senecan tragedies of Thyestes and Octavia. Ecerinis did not feature mythological characters, like Seneca's did, but dramatized historical events in Northern Italy and was based on the tyrannical career of Ezellino III de Romano. The play's objective was to warn Paduans of the danger of tyranny. Unlike later humanists, who cited classical works as examples of a glorious and far superior past, Mussato and early humanists were more concerned with the effects of the ancient tragic genre in evoking powerful emotions and moral lessons. Mussato stated that \\"the voice of the tragic poet makes minds strong when confronted by adversities, so that cowardly fear evaporates\\". Carolingian and 12th century \\"renaissances\\" did not do much to revive Roman dramatists, and Petrarchan humanists were overly concerned with advocating for classical works while not undermining Christianity. Ecerinis displays an early humanist use of the classics, as he took aspects from classical works, without advocating for the absolute supremacy of the classics. Mussato's use of both classical metre, and the ancient genre of Senecan tragedy, as well the attempted invocation of moral lessons from the tragic genre foreshadow aspects of Petrarchan humanism, and are an example of the beginning of the Petrarchan humanist movement. =Philosophy and characteristics= Medieval universities focused on the metrical and rhetorical features of writing, and this allowed early humanists, like Mussato, to recognize and emulate the verbal patterns of ancient poets. Mussato classicized Latin prose in his letters and plays, suggesting he rejected traditional medieval prose metric in favour of classical Latin. He was the first, besides Lovati, to use classicizing style in poetic letters, and in his use of classical Latin, displays a founding characteristic of later humanists in his rejection of the contemporary style of Latin in favour of classical Latin.Ronald Witt, \\"The Art of Letter Writing\\", The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism ed. Alastair Minnis and Ian Johnson (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 82. As well as letters, emulation of classical authors and style also influenced Mussato in historical writing, as he acted as chronicler in works such as Historia Augusta which described events such as Henry IV's invasion of Brescia. Historia Augusta shows classical influence in Mussato's use of classical Latin stylistically, but also conceptually, as he drew on ancients such as Sallust in the inclusion of documents in the text, and Seutonius in his characterization of individuals. In terms of Christianity, Mussato was not overly religious, but believed in the connection between historical cycles and astrological theory. Mussato's belief in the connection between historical cycles and astrological theory can be seen in the following excerpt from his De Traditione: ::\\"Paduan posterity might observe the fortune of their city, as it were, imposed by nature herself and the fatal sentence of its own history, whether on account of the location of the land or by a fluctuation of some kind of elements or by some sort of disposition concealed from mortals\\". In defense of the un-Christian nature of ancient poets, Mussato invoked Aristotle and argued that poets were the first theologians. He also argued that poetry was not a vehicle for expressing God's word, but contained allegorical representations pertaining to divinity and God's creatures. Mussato blurred the line between poetry and theology, stressing continuity between ancient poetry and the Bible. However, Mussato's later works were more traditionally Christian in nature, perhaps owing to Mussato's old age and a desire to reconcile with the medieval Christian hierarchy. =Legacy= Petrarch owed much to the early Northern Italian humanists, in their emulation, recovery and use of ancient works. Later, Petrarch would praise the works of Mussato's teacher, Lovato Lovati. As well as praise for Lovati, the humanist Colossi Salutati told Bartolomeo Oliari that his coronation of the laurel crown was due to Mussato's influence, when he wrote that \\"the first cultivator of eloquence was your compatriot Mussato of Padua\\". Theologians, monks and clergy criticized later humanists because the church believed that the study of classical poetry distracted men from religion. These later humanists, such as Petrarch and Boccacio defended the use of classical poetry the same way Mussato did several decades before by arguing that the allegorical truths classical works portrayed had contemporary relevance.David Robey \\"Humanist Views on the Study of Poetry in the Early Italian Renaissance\\", Cambridge History of Literary Criticism ed. Alastair Minnis and Ian Johnson (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 627. Petrarch consciously echoed Mussato in both the defense, and ceremony of ancient poetry, and Mussato's tragedy Ecerinis has been cited as the work to popularize tragedy, and inspire Shakespeare's Richard the III to be modeled after the Senecan tragedy. Works Albertino Mussato followed closely in the example of his teacher Lovati. They both imitated the classics and emulated the writings from Roman writers of antiquity such as Seneca and Livy. However, Ronald Witt remarks that their writings were not completely classicized. He writes about how earlier humanists such as Mussato and Lovati (among others) relied on classic Roman works and drew on them for inspiration but they \\"showed little interest in investigating the nature of the society that produced them.\\"Ronald Witt \\"Francesco Petrarca and the Parameters of Historical Research.\\" Religions (3:3), 700 The works of Mussato and his contemporaries serve as a springboard for the later humanist movement where writers took a further step and tried to recreate the past of ancient Rome through fervent imitation. The early stages of humanism are evident in works such as Mussato's poem dedicated to Henry VII (Poem 33). This poem is written in sonnet-form ‚Äì a vernacular aesthetic of Northern Italy in the early 14th century ‚Äì but its text is written in a classicizing style. Mussato received the poet laurel on December 5, 1315 as a result of his influential tragedy Ecerinis and his work on the chronicle of Henry VII's Italian expedition titled Historia Augusta (or De gestis Henrici septimi Cesaris). Mussato's works were written during the early 14th century in Italy. Mussato would probably have written his own manuscripts since he had experience as a copyist and as a notary. His manuscripts were printed as a part of Lodovico Antonio Muratori's Rerum Italicarum Scriptores (Writers on Italian Affairs). This was an eighteenth-century collection of \\"chronicles, diaries, and legal documents\\" from the years 500 ‚Äì 1500.Lodovico Antonio Muratori\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 25 March 2015 Some of Mussato's works are included in the tenth volume of this collection. Mussato's writings have been reprinted multiple times since then and some of his original manuscripts are held in the library at the University of Padua. =Drama: Ecerinis= Background Ecerinis (c. 1314) was Mussato's Latin verse tragedy modeled after Seneca's Thyestes. Many scholars cite the play as being \\"the earliest post-Ancient tragedy.\\"Timothy J. Reiss, \\"Renaissance Theatre and the Theory of Tragedy.\\" In The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism, ed. Glyn P. Norton, 229‚Äì247. Vol. 3. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 232. It is unknown when Mussato first began composing the play but he completed it after his release from Cangrande I della Scala's prison. Just as Seneca's tragedies describe the descent and ruin of monarchs, Mussato focused his play around the fall of Ezzelino III da Romano. Mussato's main source for information on Ezzelino was Rolandino of Padua's Cronica in factis et circa facta Marchie Trivixane (c. 1262). Ecerinis is a work that contains a political message against Cangrande I who was trying to invade Padua during this period. Mussato's invocation of Ezzelino in his adaptation of historical events serves as a warning for Paduans of the new tyrant threatening their city. The following lines from the play support this theory. ::[Messenger:] O, Verona, always the ancient scourge of this march, ::dwelling-place of enemies and road to wars, seat of tyranny. (174‚Äì176)Albertino Mussato, Ecerinide: Tragedia, ed. Luigi Padrin (Bologna, 1900), 34 in The play was so popular and influential that it contributed to Mussato's success in the revival of classicized writings and his receiving the poet laureate honor from the bishop and municipality of Padua. Furthermore, the play's importance was underscored when a law was passed stating that the play was to be read every Christmas as a means of reinforcing Paduan patriotism. Text The play consists of \\"five acts, a small cast, chorus of Paduans, and a boastful cruel protagonist\\". The ruler is explicitly named Ezzelino and is described as being the son of the devil. The chorus is made of the Paduan citizens who play a large role in the plot and literary scholars have noted that the chorus is the moral voice of the play. The events of the five acts take place over a period of approximately 24 years and the setting frequently changes. In Act 1, Ezzelino's mother informs him and his brother that their father is, in fact, a demon. Ezzelino and his brother are happy and Ezzelino prays to his father. The act ends with the Chorus lamenting the future. By the second act, Ezzelino is described as having taken over Verona and Padua in the space of a few days. The Chorus also appears at the end of Act 2 to lament the turn of events. In Act 3, expatriates retake Padua with the help from \\"troops of Venice, Ferrare, and the Pope.\\" Act 4 brings about Ezzelino's death and by the end of Act 5, his family are killed. The Chorus ends the play. Ecerinis is written in Latin verse and follows a Senecan model in its rhyme scheme. For example, the dialogues are written in iambic trimeter and the chorus is written using \\"a pattern of Sapphic, Adonic, and anapest\\". The themes of the play are reflected within the following lines where Mussato warns against the danger of a power-hungry tyrant: ::At what risks do you seek the heights of treacherous power? (118‚Äì119)Mussato, Ecerinide: Tragedia, ed. Padrin, 30, in ::Always watchful, he [(Ezzelino)] fears and is feared. (257)Mussato, Ecerinide: Tragedia, ed. Padrin, 31‚Äì32, in Witt describes the play as being \\"unquestionably a Christian drama\\" because of the appeals made to Christ but that this is not an indication of Mussato being devoutly Christian. Witt attributes the religious aspect of the work to the specifications of the genre wherein \\"divine interventions are standard elements.\\" =Histories= Much of the information on 14th century northern Italy comes from Mussato's histories such as the Historia Augusta Henrici VII Caesaris (History of Henry VII) and the De Gestis Italicorum Post Henricum VII Caesarem (Concerning the Deeds of the Italians after Emperor Henry VII). The former is an account of Emperor Henry VII's expedition to Italy from 1310‚Äì1313 and the latter is an account of Italian politics \\"from August 1313 to at least July 1321\\". Henry VII's expedition to gain control over Italy was met with little resistance in Padua and other cities in Northern Italy. The papacy at this time resided in Avignon and cities that promoted Henry VII's expedition did so in hopes of returning the control of the papacy back to Rome. The city submitted to his rule and Mussato's writing about him suggests that he also supported Henry VII even though the \\"Italian prince\\" made multiple mistakes in his dealings with the Italians. Some of his other prose historical works include a work about Ludwig of Bavaria (Ludovicus Bavarus, ad filium) and his last work, which he finished writing in the first months of 1329, concerning Padua's fall to Cangrande (De Traditione Patavii ad Canem Grandem Anno 1328 Mense Septembris et Causis Precedentibus). Mussato also wrote historical accounts in verse form. Some examples of his historical poems are Poem 33 and a poem titled De Obsidione Domini Canis Grandis de Verona circa Moenia Paduanae Civitatis et Conflictu Ejus (Of Canangrade's Besieging the Walls of the City of Padua and of Its Fight) (c. 1325). Historia Augusta The influence behind Mussato's writing style and forms in his Historia Augusta can be traced back to ancient historians such as Livy, Sallust, Caesar, and Suetonius. Aspects of Mussato's history included documents in the text and vivid characterizations of the people he wrote about ‚Äì all features that can be traced back to writers like Sallust and Suetonius. Mussato's history is also characterized by scholars for its clarity in the description of the chronological flow of events with clear causes and effects outlined by Mussato. Below are the first few lines of the Historia Augusta and Witt notes that they are reminiscent of Julius Caesar's commentaria because they \\"emphasized the geographical setting of the narrative.\\" =Poetry and letters= Mussato's poetry and letters are interconnected because not only did Mussato write some of his letters in verse(for example, Letters 4, 7, and 18), but he also defended poetry against Friar Giovanni of Mantua's attack (Epistola 18). Giovanni's claims on the danger of poetry to Christianity were rebuffed by Mussato who asserted that, like the Bible, poetry was inspired by God. The format of Mussato's letters reflects how he followed in the tradition of ars dictaminis, a method of letter writing that was a part of school curricula during Mussato's lifetime. In Mussato's defence of poetry, he says that it is \\"divina ars, altera philosophia, and theologia mundi.(Epistola 18,83‚Äì85).\\" In doing so he refers to poetry as a work of divinity and thus, fuses poetry with philosophy and theology into what Curtis calls \\"theological poetics\\".E.R. Curtis, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, 216, in . Mussato's merging of poetry and religion defies the medieval understanding of poetry ‚Äì which places poetry within the fields of grammar, rhetoric, and scholasticism ‚Äì and \\"[allied] him with the Christian apologetic tradition.\\" De Celebratione De Celebratione Suae Diei Nativitatis Fienda Vel Non (Whether His Birthday Ought to Be Celebrated or Not)was Mussato's autobiographical work \\"written in 1317, when Mussato was 56 years old\\". Mussato provides readers with his age at the beginning of the poem and he details his age by using an anno domini designation with his reference to the birth of Christ. ::Sexta dies haec est, sunt quinquagesima nobis ::(Tempora narrabat si mihi vera Parens) ::Musta reconduntur vasis septemque decemque ::Nune nova post ortum mille trecenta Deum.Mussato, De celebratione suae diei nativitatis fienda vel non, in Opera, fasc. 4, p.81, lines 3‚Äì6. in :::If my parents truly told me the right time, one thousand three hundred and seventeen new vintages have been closed in jars since the birth of God.Mussato, De celebratione suae diei nativitatis fienda vel non, in Opera, fasc. 4, p.81, lines 3‚Äì6., trans. Witt, in Witt notes that Mussato is \\"the first person whom we know of since antiquity to celebrate his birthday.\\" In the last half of his poem, Mussato's writing focuses on his regrets and a wish to have no more birthdays because of the risk of \\"adding evil deeds to his already heavy tally.\\" This poem follows in the confessional genre and the lament at the close indicates Mussato's wish for a better afterlife. ::Mors licet accedat melioris nuntia vitae ::nostra tamen iuris tunc erit umbra sui.De celebratione, p. 83, lines 99‚Äì100, in :::Let Death, the messenger of a better life, approach, but I will then be a shade within his domain. Poem 33 This poem was dedicated to Henry VII and is notable for its classicized meter and language. However, it relies on a sonnet-like form which can be attributed to vernacular influences in Musatto's period. Notes =References=     Further reading *Greenfield, Concetta Carestia.

As one of a few meromictic lakes in Europe, it is the object of numerous scientific studies. The Piora valley - located in the Saint-Gotthard Massif (central Swiss Alps) in the Southern part of Switzerland near Airolo at an altitude of 1921 m above sea level - is a landlocked alpine valley whose scientific value has been recognized for more than two centuries. In the past, the lake was used as a reservoir. Lake Cadagno is a rare example of crenogenic meromixis. Its waters show a permanent stratification due to a natural geological phenomenon. The lower abounds with dissolved mineral salts (sulphate, magnesium, calcium, carbonate) originating from sublacustrine springs, whereas the separate upper layer is permanently oxygenated. Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria ‚Äì among them Chromatium okenii‚Äîthrive between the two layers where they find the ideal conditions for their development. Such an ecosystem provides a good opportunity to study the metabolisms connected with eutrophication on a stable model, as it is well known that one of the advanced stages of eutrophication is biogenic meromixis.  Research  For the last 25 years the area has been increasingly used for scientific purposes, both for teaching and researching various environmental subjects. In view of stimulating educational and scientific activities at a university level, the Alpine Biology Center (ABC) has been set up by the Canton of Ticino, in cooperation with the universities of Geneva and Zurich. For this purpose, two 16th century buildings of the Alpe Piora have been turned into a laboratory and lodgings. The Microbiology Institute of the canton of Ticino is responsible both for managing the center and coordinating its activities. Cyclobotryococcatriene, a botryococcene-related hydrocarbon, was isolated from and identified in organic-rich sediments in Lake Cadagno in 2000.

It is used to test leukemia cell lines in immunocytochemical analysis of protein-protein interactions, and immunohistochemistry.  Characteristics  Although THP-1 cells are of the same lineage, mutations can cause differences as the progeny proliferates. In general, THP-1 cells exhibit a large, round, single-cell morphology. The cells were derived from the peripheral blood of a 1-year-old human male with acute monocytic leukemia. Some of their characteristics are: * Expression of Fc receptor and C3b receptors while lacking surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulins. * Production of IL-1. * Positive detection of alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase and lysozymes * Phagocytic physiology (both for latex beads and sensitized erythrocytes). * Restoration of the response of purified T lymphocytes to Con A. * Increased CO2 production on phagocytosis and differentiation into macrophage-like cells * Polarization into the M1 phenotype by incubation with IFN-Œ≥ and LPS, or to the M2 phenotype by incubation with interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 * Differentiation into immature dendritic cells, using recombinant human interleukin 4 (rhIL-4) and recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), and mature dendritic cells using rhIL-4, rhGM-CSF, recombinant human tumour necrotic factor Œ± (rhTNF-Œ±) and Ionomycin. * The HLA type for THP-1 is HLA-A*02:01; A*24:02; B*15:11; B*35:01; C*03:03; DRB1*01:01; DRB1*15:01; DQB1*05:01; DQB1*06:02; DPB1*02:01; DPB1*04:02 (in the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) cell bank). This HLA type can change depending on the reference biorepository, due to loss of heterozygosity in multiple chromosomal regions, as THP-1 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) do not express the HLA-A*24:02 and B*35:01 alleles. = Growth Information = THP-1 can provide continuous culture when grown in suspension; RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS + 2mM L-Glutamine. The average doubling time is 19 to 50 hours. 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 Œºg/ml) are also commonly added to inhibit bacterial contamination. Cultures should be maintained at cell densities in the range 2-9x105 cells/ml at 37 ¬∞C, 5% CO2. Cells are non-adherent. = Hazards = THP-1 cells are of human origin, and no evidence has been found for the presence of infectious viruses or toxic products. The ATCC Biosafety recommendation is level 1. = Research applications = THP-1 cells are used as in vitro cancer cell models, as well as a models to study the monocyte-macrophage differentiation process, and as a model to examine some macrophage-related physiological processes, for example the macrophage cholesterol efflux.

Background Ascending to the throne in February 1952, Elizabeth adopted the royal style of Elizabeth the Second. This was reflected in her royal cypher, which took the Latin form 'EIIR'. Some objected to this usage as the new queen was the first Elizabeth to reign over the United Kingdom or indeed Great Britain, Elizabeth I having been solely the queen of England. In 1953, John MacCormick took legal action against the Lord Advocate in the case of MacCormick v Lord Advocate challenging her right to call herself Elizabeth the Second. The case failed on the grounds that the matter was within the royal prerogative and thus the Queen was free to adopt any title she saw fit. However, a submission by the Crown stated that the royal title was decided to reflect the highest number from either the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland and while Elizabeth II was not the second Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, she was the second Elizabeth in the territory which now made up the United Kingdom. Actions and legacy A Royal Mail van in Scotland showing the omission of the Royal Cypher Post-1954 pattern Royal Mail lamp post box of the type used in Scotland, showing the Crown of Scotland Some occasions of vandalism and even explosions of post boxes which carried the Queen's EIIR insignia were recorded. One particular pillar box in Edinburgh's Inch district was repeatedly vandalised with tar, paint and a hammer before being blown to pieces less than three months after its unveiling.The Scots Independent, March 1953, Page 2 The folksongs Sky High Joe and The Ballad of the Inch commemorate these events. After 1953, new post boxes were placed in Scotland carrying only the Crown of Scotland image rather than the EIIR cypher, which continued to be used in the rest of the United Kingdom, and indeed in some of the Queen's other realms and territories. A post box with the EIIR cypher was installed in Dunoon in 2018 and immediately scheduled for replacement on discovery of the error.

The unique core of the Society would be the institutional grounds professional generalist the organization would remain a professional society for the individual (rather than a trade association). The majority of PGMS members are institutional grounds managers who work for organizations such as colleges and universities, municipalities, park and recreation facilities, office parks, apartment complexes, hotels/motels, cemeteries, theme parks, etc. In addition, many independent landscape contractors are also in membership. All have joined together for the purpose of education and economic advancement. The society defines a grounds manager as a member of a management team responsible for the operation and maintenance of a site or sites. The grounds manager is responsible for the management of staff, money, materials and equipment utilized in maintaining and enhancing a landscaped site including turf, trees, woody ornamentals and flowers, outdoor structure and related facilities. This can include areas such as roads, sidewalks, parking lots maintenance and repair (including snow removal). The ultimate goals are to assist the individual manager in developing techniques and management skills to assure an outstanding grounds management program for his or her organization, clients or employers and upgrade the level of the profession. Key membership benefits include: Annual conference and Green Industry Expo, bi-monthly newsletter, membership certificate, certification programs (Certified Grounds Manager and Groundskeeper Certification), free educational manuals, local branch meetings, online membership directory, site awards, free industry magazine subscriptions, etc. In keeping with its education orientation, PGMS also has student memberships, and sponsors annual scholarships for high school and college students studying in fields pertinent to horticulture and other grounds related fields.

R. Martin, and its HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones. First appearing in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Gendry is a blacksmith apprentice in King's Landing, and an unacknowledged bastard of King Robert Baratheon. He subsequently appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998), A Storm of Swords (2000) and A Feast for Crows (2005). After Queen Cersei Lannister orders the execution of all of King Robert's bastards, Gendry is forced to flee King's Landing alongside Arya Stark under the protection of Yoren, a recruiter for the Night's Watch. He later joins the outlaw group Brotherhood Without Banners and is knighted by its leader Beric Dondarrion, and becomes a follower of R'hllor. Gendry is portrayed by English actor Joe Dempsie in the HBO television adaptation.  Character description  Gendry was conceived and born in King's Landing after Robert's Rebellion ended and is one of sixteen (twenty in the television series) bastard children of King Robert Baratheon,. He is fourteen years old when introduced in the first book, and is portrayed as tall and very muscled, having blue eyes and thick black hair, very similar to his biological father Robert in youth. He also looks like a younger version of Renly Baratheon, though with a squarer jaw, bushier brows and tangled hair, but resembles his uncle enough that Brienne of Tarth for a moment almost mistook him for the deceased Renly. Gendry is an intelligent boy despite being born into poverty, but is also stubborn, sullen, suspicious, easily confused and shy around women, and Arya Stark commented that he looks pained when he tries to think. Despite being one of the only four surviving biological children of King Robert (along with Mya Stone, Edric Storm and Bella Rivers), Gendry never knew who his father was, though he did see Robert from afar multiple times and was once nearly trampled by a drunken Robert's horse while playing near the city gate. His mother was reported to have been a worker at an alehouse who died when Gendry was still a young boy, and all he remembers of her was that she had blonde hair. Later on, Tobho Mott, a master armourer from Qohor, was offered double the customary fee by a \\"lord\\" with concealed identity to take Gendry in as a smith apprentice, but accepted him for free after being impressed by the boy's physique. Gendry turns out to be a talented apprentice, and likes to spend time polishing a bull head helmet that he proudly made for himself, which earned him the nickname \\"Bull\\" by fellow orphan boy Lommy Greenhands. Storylines  Coat of arms of House Baratheon Gendry is not a point of view character in the novels, and his actions are witnessed and interpreted primarily through the eyes of Arya Stark, as well as some descriptions from Eddard Stark and Brienne of Tarth. He has the most story arc out of King Robert's children. = A Game of Thrones = In his investigation about the death of Jon Arryn, Eddard Stark meets several people who had met with Arryn shortly before his death. One of them is Gendry, who was sought by both Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon. Eddard immediately recognizes Gendry as Robert Baratheon's bastard child, and tells Tobho Mott that if Gendry ever shows interest in military service, he is to be sent directly to Eddard. Gendry has shown promise as a blacksmith and made a helmet in the shape of a bull. Eddard compliments the helmet, offering to purchase it, but Gendry refuses, to the shame of his master. = A Clash of Kings = After Eddard Stark's political fall and eventual execution, Varys makes arrangements for the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to take Gendry to the Wall in order to ensure his safety. Gendry travels north with Yoren and thirty other recruits including Lommy Greenhands, Hot Pie and a disguised Arya Stark. Not far from King's Landing they are stopped by several gold cloaks from the City Watch, who demand that Yoren give up Gendry as he is wanted by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister. Yoren refuses, and chases off the gold cloaks with his recruits. Later, near an abandoned holdfast by the God's Eye, the recruits are attacked by soldiers led by Ser Amory Lorch. Yoren is killed in the fight, and Gendry along with Arya, Lommy and Hot Pie escape through a secret tunnel. Whilst on a reconnaissance run with Arya, Gendry confronts her about her true gender and identity. He eventually has the truth out of her and is subsequently embarrassed by how crass he had spoken to her when she was in fact highborn. Gendry is later captured by Ser Gregor Clegane's soldiers, but is spared from death since a blacksmith is useful as a slave laborer. After Lannister man-at-arms Polliver kills the injured Lommy, they are taken to Harrenhal, where Gendry works as a smith. When Arya decides to escape from Harrenhal, however, she persuades Gendry and Hot Pie to join her. = A Storm of Swords = While wandering around the Riverlands looking for the direction of Riverrun, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are captured by the Brotherhood without Banners, led by a resurrected Beric Dondarrion. At the Peach brothel in Stoney Sept, Gendry declines sleeping with Bella, but later argues with Arya out of jealousy because she talked to Beric's squire Edric Dayne, who claims to be Jon Snow's milk brother. Gendry is later impressed with Thoros of Myr's description of the ideals of the brotherhood, and decides to join them. He is knighted by Beric, thus becoming Ser Gendry, knight of the hollow hill. = A Feast for Crows = While questing to find Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth encounters Gendry working as a smith at the Inn at the Crossroads along with a group of orphans, and is struck by his resemblance to the late Renly Baratheon. At the inn, Brienne encounters and duels with Rorge, killing him, only to be savaged by Biter; Gendry saves Brienne by driving a spear through Biter's neck. = Family tree of House Baratheon = TV adaptation Joe Dempsie plays the role of Gendry in the television series Game of Thrones. Gendry is played by Joe Dempsie in the television adaption of the series of books. Explaining how he got cast for the role: > When I was cast as Gendry, I didn't have any of the physical attributes the > part required. I was astounded that I got the role, to be honest. But David > and Dan said, \\"We need to dye his hair black ... and it'd be great you hit > the gym before we start filming.\\" So I was told to get in shape. Dempsie has received positive reviews for his performance as Gendry in the television series. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2014. =Season 1= Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark tells the smith to send Gendry to him if he ever shows interest in wielding a sword. Gendry shows promise as a smith and makes a helmet in the shape of a bull's head; Eddard compliments the helmet, offering to purchase it. Gendry refuses, to the shame of the master smith. After Ned's arrest and eventual execution, arrangements are made for Yoren of the Night's Watch to take Gendry to the Wall with him. =Season 2= Gendry travels North with Yoren and other Night's Watch recruits, including Arya Stark (disguised as an orphan boy named 'Arry), Lommy Greenhands, Hot Pie and Jaqen H'ghar. During their journey, they are stopped by the Goldcloaks of the City Watch. They demand that Yoren hand Gendry over to them because King Joffrey has ordered that all of his father Robert's bastards be killed. Yoren turns the Goldcloaks away. Later, Gendry forces Arya to reveal her true identity, and is surprised to learn she is Ned Stark's daughter. After the Goldcloaks get help from Ser Amory Lorch and his men, they ambush the travelling party. In the chaos, Yoren is killed. Gendry's life is saved by Arya, who convinces the Goldcloaks that Lommy, who was killed during the attack, was Gendry. Gendry and the rest of the recruits are escorted to Harrenhal, the ruined castle-turned-prison. Ser Gregor Clegane oversees order here, and arbitrarily has many of the prisoners tortured and killed. Gendry is nearly tortured and killed but is saved by the arrival of Lord Tywin Lannister, who chides Clegane's men for their reckless treatment of the prisoners. Due to Jaqen H'ghar's help, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are able to escape Harrenhal. =Season 3= As they head towards the Riverlands, the group encounters the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of outlaws who defend the weak. Inspired, Gendry decides to join the Brotherhood but is betrayed by them when they sell him to Lady Melisandre, as ordered by the Lord of Light. Melisandre later reveals to Gendry that the late King Robert was his father, and that she is bringing him to meet his uncle Stannis at Dragonstone. But in truth, Melisandre and Stannis plan to use Gendry's blood in a magic ritual to create a death curse on the usurpers to his throne, King Joffrey, the King in the North Robb Stark, and King of the Iron Islands Balon Greyjoy. Before they can sacrifice Gendry, Davos Seaworth helps him escape to King's Landing in a rowboat. Unable to swim or row competently, Gendry is nevertheless convinced that the Red Woman has a surer death in store for him, and returns to Westeros' capital by sea. =Season 7= In the years after his escape from Dragonstone, a series of events result in the deaths of the rest of House Baratheon, leaving Gendry as the only person with Baratheon heritage. Gendry returns to work as a blacksmith in King's Landing, hiding in plain sight from the Lannister soldiers and Goldcloaks. Although he reasons that the Lannisters will not think to look for him in the city, he grates at having to manufacture weapons for their army. Gendry is greeted by Davos, who has briefly returned to the capital to find him. He wants Gendry's assistance in the coming war against the White Walkers. Gendry eagerly agrees. After meeting King in the North, Jon Snow, and bonding over their statuses as bastard sons of Robert Baratheon and (allegedly) Ned Stark respectively, they head north to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Gendry, alongside Jon, Tormund Giantsbane, Sandor Clegane, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr and Jorah Mormont, travel beyond the Wall to retrieve a wight to present as evidence to Cersei Lannister of the impending White Walker invasion. Gendry still resents Beric and Thoros for selling him. The group manages to capture a lone wight, but Jon realizes that the rest of the wights are approaching and orders Gendry to run back to Eastwatch to send a raven to Daenerys Targaryen requesting her assistance. After running through the night, Gendry collapses from exhaustion outside Eastwatch, but is rescued by Davos and a group of wildlings, managing to tell them of Jon's warning. =Season 8= Gendry joins Daenerys' army as they camp at Winterfell in anticipation of the White Walkers' attack. Gendry is tasked with smithing weapons from dragonglass, capable of killing the wights. Reunited with Arya, she bids him create a dual-bladed, dragonglass staff. On the eve of the attack, Gendry gives her the weapon and relates his Baratheon heritage to her. Arya inquires of his past romantic liaisons, then expresses her desire to lose her virginity, should they die tomorrow, and they make love. Gendry survives the Long Night and is legitimised a Baratheon by Daenerys, and given lordship of Storm's End. Gendry professes his love to Arya and proposes but Arya declines, not wanting the life of a lady. Daenerys wrests control of King's Landing from Cersei Lannister, but burns the populace of the city after they surrender to her. Jon tries but fails to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. With the deaths of Cersei and Daenerys, Westeros is left without a ruler. Gendry travels to King's Landing along with Westeros' other nobility to decide the future of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion proposes that Bran Stark be crowned king. Gendry approves, along with the other lords, unanimously.

This was Kander's first show, and his only one written without Fred Ebb in Ebb's lifetime. Synopsis In Chicago, Gerry Siegal and Sally Nathan, a young suburban Chicago couple, decide to marry. The bride's Uncle Alfie (her guardian) wants an intimate wedding and wages a war of words with the groom's entire family. The groom's brassy Jewish mother Tillie commandeers the planning, steering it towards a large country club wedding (despite her husband's scolding her for taking over). Caterers, dressmakers, band leaders, rabbis, florists, photographers and a bossy wedding planner are pushed to the limit by the madcap preparations. The bride and groom, who have retained their sanity, realize that their families have almost destroyed the wedding. They announce their intention to have a quiet family affair.

Although all three would enjoy great success, when the musical was written only William Goldman was doing well in his career. He later remembered: > They were older than I was, Kander and my brother, and they were the ones > who were supposed to succeed and they weren't I was. It terrified me and I > wrote a musical with my brother and Kander, A Family Affair, which got on, > which failed. I don't know why I did it. Here were these two wonderful > figures for me and I was doing well and they weren't and I helped them in my > own nutty way. Except it didn't work out that way, since everything I tried > for the theatre failed.Egan p 29 William Goldman says the idea for the musical was his.Egan p 33 It was originally optioned by Leland Hayward and when he dropped the option their agent, Richard Seff, talked his cousin Andrew into producing it. Money was raised by doing live auditions, according to Seff: > Jim couldn't sing a note, Bill can't really sing but John Kander can a > little bit, so Kander would play and sing and Bill would sing with him and > then I had to get up and sing with them too so here was the agent playing > actor. There were thirty people, fifty people, and we'd raise the thousand > dollars one night and two thousand the next and we put together the whole > show that way.Egan p 33 The credits are shared by all three equally. \\"I would not say I was a major contributor to the lyrics, but we all decided the three of us would take the billing,\\" remembers William Goldman.Egan p 33 Production history Originally planned as a project for Gertrude Berg to be directed by Jerome Robbins, it opened in Philadelphia directed instead by Word Baker, who recently had staged The Fantasticks off-Broadway. With everything from the script to the score to the set in disarray, theatre producer Hal Prince was brought in to replace Baker and repair the damage. Poor box office prevented the out-of-town tryout from being extended and Prince, making his directorial debut, brought the show to New York City knowing it was better but still in need of serious work. The Broadway production opened on January 27, 1962, at the Billy Rose Theatre, where it ran for 65 performances and five previews. The cast included neurotic comic Shelley Berman as Alfie, Eileen Heckart as Tillie, Rita Gardner as Sally, and Larry Kert as Gerry, with Morris Carnovsky, Cathryn Damon, Bibi Osterwald, and Linda Lavin in supporting roles. According to Richard Seff: > We kept it alive, barely. It earned a living for those nine weeks but it > never made any profit to speak of and to go on longer would have meant to > take big losses so it was sensible to close it... When we first heard it, we > thought it had great charm. But I think it would have been helped by a > director who really understood big musicals and Wood Baker had just had the > great success with Fantastiks, which was only a few people in a tiny, tiny > theatre, and he did that one imaginatively, but this one he did not do > imaginatively and it was very clunky. A lot depends on the director in a > musical. He really can make fair material much better and a bad director can > take excellent material and make it worse... Hal Prince took over the > direction out of town. He helped it a lot. It got better. It just didn't get > good enough.Egan p 35 An original cast recording was released by United Artists Records.

Quietism in philosophy sees the role of philosophy as broadly therapeutic or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy. By re- formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to humanity's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude. Quietist philosophers By its very nature, quietism is not a philosophical school as understood in the traditional sense of a body of dogmas. Instead, it can be identified both by its methodology, which focuses on language and the use of words, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only pseudo-problems. Pyrrhonism represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. Sextus Empiricus regarded Pyrrhonism not as a nihilistic attack but rather as a form of philosophical therapy: Contemporary discussion of quietism can be traced back to Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose work greatly influenced the ordinary language philosophers. One of the early 'ordinary language' works, Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind, attempted to demonstrate that dualism arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behaviour. J. L. Austin's Sense and Sensibilia took a similar approach to the problems of skepticism and the reliability of sense perception, arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with empirical evidence. Norman Malcolm, a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the philosophy of mind. More recently, the philosophers John McDowell and Richard Rorty have taken explicitly quietist positions.

Confucianism The teaching of Confucius (551 BCE ‚Äì 479 BCE) taught of five basic relationships in life: * Father to son * Older sibling to younger sibling * Husband to wife * Friend to friend * Ruler to structure For dynasties that used Confucianism (not Legalism), the first noted person(s) in the relationship was always superior and had to act as a guide and leader/ role model to the second noted person(s), as the second person was to follow. For example: Father, 1st noted; Son, 2nd noted. Early Imperial Period From the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty (221 B.C.- A.D. 1840), the Chinese government divided Chinese people into four classes: landlord, peasant, craftsmen, and merchant. Landlords and peasants constituted the two major classes, while merchant and craftsmen were collected into the two minor. Theoretically, except for the position of the Emperor, nothing was hereditary.Dr. Yi Li, \\"The Structure and Evolution of Chinese Social Stratification\\", University Press of America (January 2005), During the 361 years of civil war after the Han Dynasty (202 B.C. - 220 A.D.), there was a partial restoration of feudalism when wealthy and powerful families emerged with large amounts of land and huge numbers of semi-serfs. They dominated important civilian and military positions of the government, making the positions available to members of their own families and clans.Robert Mortimer Marsh, Mandarins: The Circulation of Elites in China, 1600-1900, Ayer (June, 1980), hardcover, The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 13, 30 After the Tang dynasty's yellow emergence, the government extended the Imperial examination system as an attempt to eradicate this feudalism.  Song dynasty  A Song dynasty gentry and his servant depicted by Ma Yuan circa 1225 During the Song dynasty social strata was clearly divided and enforced by the law. At the bottom of the pyramid were the commoners who were categorized into two groups: Fangguo Hu (city dwellers) and Xiangcun Hu (rural population). Fangguo Hu and Xiangcun Hu had ranks. The first rank, commoners (both Fangguo and Xiangcun), were the wealthiest. The ranks of commoners could change over time, as one who acquired more wealth could be promoted to a higher rank. On the other hand, gentries and government officials were not commoners. They and their families belong to Guan Hu (Gentries). Guan Hu was not an exclusive social stratum like European nobility; by participating and passing the imperial exam, one can be qualified as a member of Guan Hu. In addition, relatives of a government official can become a Guan Hu through the system of En Yin. In some rarer cases, a commoner can become Guan Hu by donating a large amount of money, grain or industrial materials to the imperial court. In 1006, Guan Hu accounted for 1.3% of the entire population. The percentage of Guan Hu increased to 2.8% by the year of 1190. The growing population of Guan Hu was partly due to the system of En Yin which allows a relatively easy entry into the stratum of Guan Hu. At the top of the social pyramid was the royal house of Song dynasty. The royal house consists of the Emperor, Empress, concubines, princes and princesses. The royal house enjoys the highest quality of life with everything provided by other social strata. With imperial fields (fields that were owned by the emperor), the basic food supplies of the royal house were satisfied. Luxury items in the imperial court also had their sources. Tea, for example, was provided by the imperial tea plantation. Annually, local products of various regions of China were paid as tributes to the royal house. During the Song Dynasty, slave trading was forbidden and punished by law. However, slavery was not entirely absent from the history of the Song dynasty. To some extent, there were slave traders who illegally kidnapped commoners and sold them as slaves. Criminals were sometimes converted to slaves by the government. However, traditional slavery was not a common practice during the Song dynasty. Servants of wealthy gentries usually kept a contract-like relationship with the lords served.Wang p.501 In reality, the Song society's structure had evolved and changed over time. After the Jingkang incident, the phenomenon of land annexation became increasingly obvious. By land annexation, the wealthy commoners and government officials privatized lands that were public or owned by poorer people. In late Song dynasty, the society's two ends polarized. Wealthy land owners devoured most of the cultivable lands, leaving others in extreme poverty. Even the imperial court's profit was curbed. Taxation was illegally avoided by wealthy landowners and the court eventually found itself collecting much less amount of taxes than ever before. Xie Fangshu, an investigating censor famously described the situation as \\"The flesh of the poor ones becomes the food of the strong ones\\" (Âº±ËÇâÂº∫È£ü).  Jurchen Empire  The Jurchen Jin dynasty coexisted with the Song dynasty after Jingkang incident. The Jurchen empire ruled the north part of China. Under the Jurchen rule, the conventional code Begile was introduced. Under this code, an emperor and his courtiers were equal. Emperor Xizong of Jin reformed the empire's legal system and abolished the begile during the reform of Tianjuan. The reform eliminated the aboriginal Jurchen conventions and substituted them with the conventions of Song and Liao dynasty. During Jin dynasty, Minggan Moumuke, groups of Jurchen soldiers who settled down in Northern China, changed their nomadic life-style to the agricultural life-style of Chinese commoners.  Yuan dynasty  250x250px Kublai, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, notably gave many financial privileges to the gentries of Jiangnan region. After the defeat of Song dynasty by Yuan, making friends with the local elites of Song became important. As a consequence, the most wealthy ones in the Song social strata remained wealthy in the Yuan dynasty. Contrary to the situation of the gentries, commoners of Yuan dynasty found themselves less protected by the law. Mongol rulers did not seem to take the interests of commoners a priority. A great number of ordinary farmers were converted to plantation workers working for the gentries. The wealthy entered upon the properties of commoners while making them essentially slave-peasants. The Mongols in the Yuan dynasty belong to numerous clans. Tao Zongyi first provided a list of all the Mongol clans which was later falsified by Japanese historian Yanai Watari. However, Tao's account was one of the few contemporary accounts of Mongols during Yuan dynasty. The records and documents of Yuan dynasty provide extremely limited information about the social strata of Mongols. Despite of the lack of historical records, it is safe to say that Mongols enjoyed privileges that other ethical groups did not. During their reign, the Mongols converted a large amount of rice fields into pastures because agriculture was foreign to them. Both the government and Mongol nobles opened up pastures in China by taking the rice fields away from ordinary farmers.Meng p.155 Other social castes including Semu, Hanren and Nanren existed under the rule of Mongols. Hanren refers to dwellers of Northern China, Korea and Sichuan. Nanren refers to citizens of the Song dynasty (excluding people from Sichuan, although the region was a part of Song). Yuan dynasty introduced the policy of Colored population statistics(). The policy divided commoners according to their occupation.Farmers, soldiers, craftsmen, hunters, physicians, messengers and Confucian scholars are some of the categories under this policy. The farmers had the largest population among all the commoners in Yuan dynasty. These categories are hereditary. One soldier will give birth to a son who will later become a soldier. In comparison with other commoners, craftsmen were treated more fairly since the Mongols deemed the skills of making weapons necessary for their conquest of the world. The Mongols routinely massacred Chinese civilians with the exception of Craftsmen.Meng p.172 Slavery was common during the Yuan dynasty. The main sources of slaves include captives,History of Yuan vol.119,120 criminals, kidnapped commoners, buying and selling of human lives. Slave status was also hereditary. A slave will give birth to slave children.Meng 179-182  Ming dynasty  Palace gate of Prince Jingjiang in Guilin. The palace-city of Ming princes is the symbol of privilege they enjoyed during Ming dynasty The Ming dynasty was the second to the last imperial dynasty of China established in 1368 following the fall of Yuan dynasty. The imperial court of Ming kept a nationwide register of every subject---Ji(Á±ç). This practice of registering population was inherited from the previous Yuan dynasty. Venetian traveler Marco Polo noticed similar policy during his visit of Hangzhou. Ming government formalized the registration with the yellow booklet which records every member of a given family. In addition, there was the white booklet which records the taxation of a family.History of Ming vol.77 The policy of Colored population statistics of Yuan dynasty was inherited by Ming and reformed. The numerous categories of commoners were reduced into only 3 categories. Soldier, Commoners, and Craftsmen. These castes were hereditary and fixed. Moving from one category to another was virtually impossible. Subcategories of the three main categories were more specific and profession-based. According to Taiwanese historian Cai Shishan, there were also salt refiners which were independent from other 3 categories. Gentries in Ming dynasty belong to the caste of commoners. There were two types of gentries. Those who passed the entry-level exam of the imperial exam were called Shengyuan(ÁîüÂì°). All Shengyuan receive a fixed amount of allowance from the imperial court. The average amount of allowance ranges from 18 tael to 12 tael. The rest of the gentries mainly earned their living by teaching in private schools as mentors. Farmers during the Ming dynasty had two groups. Self-sustained farmer accounted for 10% of all farmers while employee farmers of wealthy landlords made up as much as 90%. Employed farmers had more burdens and gained less harvest than self- sustained farmers. Craftsmen were severely exploited by the government. They had to provide free services upon the demand of the imperial court without any reward. The two groups of Craftsmen are: Official craftsmen who directly worked for the court and Common craftsmen who provide paid services for others. In Ming dynasty, Royal house was a large and special social stratum. The royal house of Ming includes any descendants of Emperor Taizu of Ming and his nephew Prince Jingjiang Zhu Shouqian. Emperor Taizu had 26 sons and 19 of them had offspring. With the line of Prince Jingjiang, the royal house consists of 20 different cadet branches. Members of the royal house were not allowed to have an ordinary life by laboring. All the expenditures of the royal house were paid by the money taken from the annual tax revenue collected from commoners. Additional perks such as legal privileges and luxury items were given as gifts by the imperial court. In the middle of the 17th century, the population of the royal house was so large that their living expenditures had taken up to 225.79% of the annual tax revenue causing a virtual bankruptcy of the government.  Qing dynasty  In the Qing dynasty, the population could be divided into five classes. The top class was the emperor and his immediate family. After that were Social-Bureaucrats and Gentrys, who all ran the government. Below that was the working class and finally the lower classes. = Gentry = Gentry were from the Gentry Society. Most Gentry owned land, which was where most of their income came from. Their main source of income, however, was from their government service because they had certain academic degrees. Unlike other elite individuals, who lived in rural areas, gentry usually resided in large cities or towns, where they managed political, social and economic affairs. Once they were done with their service to the government, they would rejoin Gentry Society. = Social-bureaucrats = Social-bureaucrats were the lifeline of Qing China. They also had the responsibilities of organizing public works projects and had a crucial role in the management of society. Social-bureaucrats wore distinctive clothing, including black gowns with blue borders and a multitude of rank insignia. Commoners addressed them with honorific titles and they received a high status along with favorable legal treatment. = Working class = The working class was a very broad designation, including everyone from day laborers, to tenant farmers and landlords. It could also be divided into three subcategories: peasants, workers and merchants. Peasants were the largest and most respected class of the three because they were seen as honest workers by providing food for the nation. Despite the workers' lower status, they often earned more than peasants. Artisans and workers often worked directly for the state or gentry. Merchants were ranked at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Merchants could include anyone from street peddlers to individuals with high influence and wealth. Merchants were perceived as a low ranking class because of their unethical business practices. They would bribe government officials or use profit-sharing to gain funding. Merchant families could use this wealth to pay their children's education which would allow them to move up in society. = Lower classes = The lower classes of ordinary people were divided into two categories: one of them the good \\"commoner\\" people, the other the \\"mean\\" people. Slaves, Servants, Prostitutes, Entertainers, Low Level Government Employees and Military Forces were part of the mean class. The soldiers were called a necessary evil, and civilians were placed in command to keep the military from dominating society. The mean people were heavily discriminated against, forbidden to take the Imperial Examination, and mean and good people could not marry each other. Social structure in modern China =1911 to 1949= After 1911, China entered the Warlord Era. During this time, industrialization was slow to non-existent; between the years 1920 and 1949, the industrial sector had only increased by less than three million members, mainly women and children working in cotton mills. The main changes in social structure were military. In 1924, the Soviet Union helped Sun Yat-sen rebuild the Nationalist Kuomintang, GMT, and KMT military force, most notably through the Military Academy, an island on Pearl River near Guangzhou. Many military leaders of the following decades were Huangpu graduates, including Lin Biao, as well as nationalist Chinese generals. After the allied forces of the Kuomintang and the Communists reunified China, Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of underworld forces such as the Green Gang, attacked the Communists. This had the effect of suppressing labor unions. =1949 to 1976= In 1949, in the wake of the communist victory in the Chinese civil war, Chinese society experienced massive upheaval. The communist revolutionaries who had eschewed capitalism and elitism now became the rich ruling class they had sought to overthrow. The Communist Party cadres became the new upper class.Yin Qian, \\"Dynamics Vs. Tradition in Chinese Foreign Policy Motivation: Beijing's Fifth Column Policy in Hong Kong as a Test Case\\", Nova Science Publishers, 1999 The misuse and manipulation of the ration system by members of the cadre class threatened to change them into a new class of privileged bureaucrats and technicians, mere descendants of the pre-revolutionary ruling class of cadre technocrats and selected representatives of the old proletariat. Whereas in the past, their position had been accessed primarily through acceptance to the best schools, now cadre status came to give them access to materials and options not fairly distributed amongst all. Housing had always been in demand in China, particularly in the larger cities, and cadres were protected from the intense competition for living space. In the countryside, the landlord class was eliminated during the land reform. In 1959, there were ten million state cadres, thirty-five million state workers, and two hundred million peasants.Huang McBeath, Jenifer, McBeath, Jerry,\\"Environmental Change and Food Security in China\\", Springer Netherlands,2010 Chinese society was typical of agrarian societies because the peasant class composed the majority of the population. Following the implementation of land reforms, Mao instituted a process of collectivization in response to the selling of land by peasants to the new generation of rich landowners. Afraid of creating a new landlord class, Mao instituted a system of communes where land was supposed to be worked equally by peasants. His idea was to capitalize on the sheer number of peasants and effectively produce a surplus harvest that would help industrialization. This was known as the Great Leap Forward, which was a failure and resulted in the deaths of twenty to thirty million peasants.Jean Lipman-Blumen,\\"The Allure of Toxic Leaders: Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt and Politicians - and How We Can Survive Them\\", Oxford University Press,(October 1, 2006) Just as farmers were put into communes, state workers were placed in large work units called danweis. Since urban education reform was growing at a much faster rate than in rural areas, more and more workers were high school graduates. The slowing down of state industries and the increasing number of qualified middle-class candidates contributed to the fact it became more and more difficult to obtain a position as a state worker. At this time, the hukou system was implemented, which divided the population into urban and rural residents. This was done to make the distribution of state services through danweis and communes easier and to better organize the population in preparation for a possible invasion from the Soviet Union. The hukou system made it illegal to migrate from the countryside to the city. During the Cultural Revolution, the composition of society changed again. Schools were closed and many youths were sent down to the countryside putatively to learn from the peasants. Concern for peasants was reflected in the rural medical and educational services known as barefoot doctors and barefoot teachers. The life expectancy of peasants increased from less than forty years before 1949 to more than sixty years in the 1970s. At the same time, peasants were still the most illiterate, most powerless, and poorest social class.Everett Zhang, Arthur Kleinman, Weiming Tu, \\"Governance of Life in Chinese Moral Experience: The Quest for an Adequate Life\\", Routledge, 2011 In a speech made shortly after the communist's victory in 1949, Mao Zedong claimed that Chinese society had four distinct social classes; this is often cited as the reason why the Chinese flag has four small stars on it. In his On the People's Democratic Dictatorship speech he defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (Â£´Ëæ≤Â∑•ÂïÜ) shi, nong, gong, shang (\\"the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie\\". Mao made the claim that these classes had been unified by the revolution, but severe class stratification still existed in post 1949 China, especially when comparing the rights ordinary citizen to the extreme privileges afforded to the elites of the Communist party. =After 1979= After the Gaige Kaifang policy was implemented in the late 1970s, the Communist system Mao had instituted disintegrated in the face of economic development. In the countryside, communes had disappeared by 1984. State-run enterprises known as danweis began to lay off workers, \\"smashing the iron rice bowl\\" because of their expense and inefficiency.Kjeld Erik Br√∏dsgaard, Mads Kirkeb√¶k,\\"China and Denmark: Relations Since 1674\\", NIAS, 2000 Notes References #China Cadre Statistics Fifty Years, 1949‚Äì1998, 1. #China Labor Statistical Yearbook 1998, 9., 17. #China Statistical Yearbook 2002, 120-121. #China Statistical Yearbook 2004, 126-127 and 150. #People's Daily Overseas Edition, 10/11/2002, 1. *The figures of cadre from 1966-1970, as well as 2002-2003 are estimated. *From 1958 to 1977, the figure of peasant workers was around 20 million.

The album was released in 1973 (see 1973 in country music) on the Epic Records label. It peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Country Albums chart. Background Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the fairy tale romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector- influenced production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans couldn't get enough of the pair who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, \\"The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did have a relationship.\\" The truth was not as idyllic as their fans preferred to imagine it. Years later, in the documentary Stand By Your Dream, Wynette recalled, \\"It was very difficult on us, both of us being in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours a day. We were constantly together.

Sections of the rights of way for the power lines that make up the two crossed ground dipole antennas can be seen passing through the forest at lower left. In radio communication, a ground dipole, also referred to as an earth dipole antenna, transmission line antenna, and in technical literature as a horizontal electric dipole (HED), is a huge, specialized type of radio antenna that radiates extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves. It is the only type of transmitting antenna that can radiate practical amounts of power in the frequency range of 3 Hz to 3 kHz, commonly called ELF waves A ground dipole consists of two ground electrodes buried in the earth, separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers, linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter located between them. Alternating current electricity flows in a giant loop between the electrodes through the ground, radiating ELF waves, so the ground is part of the antenna. To be most effective, ground dipoles must be located over certain types of underground rock formations. The idea was proposed by U.S. Dept. of Defense physicist Nicholas Christofilos in 1959. Although small ground dipoles have been used for years as sensors in geological and geophysical research, their only use as antennas has been in a few military ELF transmitter facilities to communicate with submerged submarines. Besides small research and experimental antennas, four full-scale ground dipole installations are known to have been constructed; two by the U.S. Navy at Republic, Michigan and Clam Lake, Wisconsin, one by the Russian Navy on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk, Russia. and one in India at the INS Kattabomman naval base. The U.S. facilities were used between 1985 and 2004 but are now decommissioned. Antennas at ELF frequencies Although the official ITU definition of extremely low frequencies is 3 Hz to 30 Hz, the wider band of frequencies of 3 Hz to 3 kHz with corresponding wavelengths from 100,000 km to 100 km. is used for ELF communication and are commonly called ELF waves. The frequency used in the U.S. and Russian transmitters, about 80 Hz, generates waves 3750 km (2300 miles) long, roughly one quarter of the Earth's diameter. ELF waves have been used in very few manmade communications systems because of the difficulty of building efficient antennas for such long waves. Ordinary types of antenna (half-wave dipoles and quarter-wave monopoles) cannot be built for such extremely long waves because of their size. A half wave dipole for 80 Hz would be 1162 miles long. So even the largest practical antennas for ELF frequencies are very electrically short, very much smaller than the wavelength of the waves they radiate. The disadvantage of this is that the efficiency of an antenna drops as its size is reduced below a wavelength. An antenna's radiation resistance, and the amount of power it radiates, is proportional to where is its length and is the wavelength. So even physically large ELF antennas have very small radiation resistance, and so radiate only a tiny fraction of the input power as ELF waves; most of the power applied to them is dissipated as heat in various ohmic resistances in the antenna. ELF antennas must be tens to hundreds of kilometers long, and must be driven by powerful transmitters in the megawatt range, to produce even a few watts of ELF radiation. Fortunately, the attenuation of ELF waves with distance is so low (1‚Äì2 dB per 1000 km) that a few watts of radiated power is enough to communicate worldwide. A second problem stems from the required polarization of the waves. ELF waves only propagate long distances in vertical polarization, with the direction of the magnetic field lines horizontal and the electric field lines vertical. Vertically oriented antennas are required to generate vertically polarized waves. Even if sufficiently large conventional antennas could be built on the surface of the Earth, these would generate horizontally polarized, not vertically polarized waves. History Submarines when submerged are shielded by seawater from all ordinary radio signals, and therefore are cut off from communication with military command authorities. VLF radio waves can penetrate 50‚Äì75 feet into seawater and have been used since WW II to communicate with submarines, but the submarine must rise close to the surface, making it vulnerable to detection. In 1958, the realization that ELF waves could penetrate deeper into seawater, to normal submarine operating depths led U.S. physicist Nicholas Christofilos to suggest that the U.S. Navy use them to communicate with submarines. The U.S. military researched many different types of antenna for use at ELF frequencies. Cristofilos proposed applying currents to the Earth to create a vertical loop antenna, and it became clear that this was the most practical design. The feasibility of the ground dipole idea was tested in 1962 with a 42 km leased power line in Wyoming, and in 1963 with a 176 km prototype wire antenna extending from West Virginia to North Carolina. How a ground dipole works Ground dipole antenna, similar to the U.S. Clam Lake antennas, showing how it works. The alternating current, , is shown flowing in one direction only through the loop for clarity. A ground dipole functions as an enormous vertically oriented loop antenna (see drawing, right). It consists of two widely separated electrodes buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter located between them. The alternating current from the transmitter travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line. This creates an alternating magnetic field through the loop, which radiates ELF waves. Due to their low frequency, ELF waves have a large skin depth and can penetrate a significant distance through earth, so it doesn't matter that half the antenna is under the ground. The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates vertically polarized waves. The radiation pattern of the antenna is directional, a dipole pattern, with two lobes (maxima) in the plane of the loop, off the ends of the transmission lines. In the U.S. installations two ground dipoles are used, oriented perpendicular to each other, to allow the beam to be steered in any direction by altering the relative phase of the currents in the antennas. The amount of power radiated by a loop antenna is proportional to , where is the current in the loop and is the area enclosed, To radiate practical power at ELF frequencies, the loop has to carry a current of hundreds of amperes and enclose an area of at least several square miles. Christofilos found that the lower the electrical conductivity of the underlying rock, the deeper the current will go, and the larger the effective loop area. Radio frequency current will penetrate into the ground to a depth equal to the skin depth of the ground at that frequency, which is inversely proportional to the square root of ground conductivity . The ground dipole forms a loop with effective area of , where is the total length of the transmission lines and is the skin depth. Thus, ground dipoles are sited over low conductivity underground rock formations (this contrasts with ordinary radio antennas, which require good earth conductivity for a low resistance ground connection for their transmitters). The two U.S. Navy antennas were located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, on the Canadian Shield (Laurentian Shield) formation, which has unusually low conductivity of 2√ó10‚àí4 siemens/meter. resulting in an increase in antenna efficiency of 20 dB. The earth conductivity at the site of the Russian transmitter is even lower. Because of their lack of civilian applications, little information about ground dipoles is available in antenna technical literature. U.S. Navy ELF antennas Map showing location of the US Navy ELF transmitters. The red lines show the paths of the ground dipole antennas. The Clam Lake facility (left) had two crossed 14 mile (23 km) ground dipoles. The Republic facility had two 14 mile dipoles oriented east-west, and one 28 mile dipole oriented north- south. The different shapes of the dipoles was dictated by land availability, and did not indicate a difference in design. After initially considering several larger systems (Project Sanguine), the U.S. Navy constructed two ELF transmitter facilities, one at Clam Lake, Wisconsin and the other at Republic, Michigan, 145 miles apart, transmitting at 76 Hz. They could operate independently, or phase synchronized as one antenna for greater output power. The Clam Lake site, the initial test facility, transmitted its first signal in 1982 and began operation in 1985, while the Republic site became operational in 1989. With an input power of 2.6 megawatts, the total radiated ELF output power of both sites working together was 8 watts. However, due to the low attenuation of ELF waves this tiny radiated power was able to communicate with submarines over about half the Earth's surface. Both transmitters were shut down in 2004. The official Navy explanation was that advances in VLF communication systems had made them unnecessary. Russian Navy ZEVS antennas The Russian Navy operates an ELF transmitter facility, named ZEVS (\\"Zeus\\"), to communicate with its submarines, located 30 km southeast of Murmansk on the Kola peninsula in northern Russia. Signals from it were detected in the 1990s at Stanford University and elsewhere. It normally operates at 82 Hz, using MSK (minimum shift keying) modulation. although it reportedly can cover the frequency range from 20‚Äì250 Hz. It reportedly consists of two parallel ground dipole antennas 60 km long, driven at currents of 200‚Äì300 amperes. Calculations from intercepted signals indicate it is 10 dB more powerful than the U.S. transmitters. Unlike them it is used for geophysical research in addition to military communications. Indian Navy antennas The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base, in Tamil Nadu, to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines. Radiated power The total power radiated by a ground dipole is :P = \\\\frac {\\\\pi^2 f^2 I^2 L^2}{2 c^2 h \\\\sigma} \\\\, where is the frequency, is the RMS current in the loop, is the length of the transmission line, is the speed of light, is the height above ground of the ionosphere‚Äôs D layer, and is the ground conductivity. The radiated power of an electrically small loop antenna normally scales with the fourth power of the frequency, but at ELF frequencies the effects of the ionosphere result in a less severe reduction in power proportional to the square of frequency. Receiving antennas Ground dipoles are not needed for reception of ELF signals, although some radio amateurs use small ones for this purpose. Instead, various loop and ferrite coil antennas have been used for reception. The requirements for receiving antennas at ELF frequencies are far less stringent than transmitting antennas: In ELF receivers, noise in the signal is dominated by the large atmospheric noise in the band. Even the tiny signal captured by a small, inefficient receiving antenna contains noise that greatly exceeds the small amount of noise generated in the receiver itself. Because the outside noise is what limits reception, very little power from the antenna is needed for the intercepted signal to overwhelm the internal noise, and hence small receive antennas can be used with no disadvantage.

She is played by actress Calista Flockhart. In a two-part 2010 episode, actress Kay Panabaker portrayed a teenage Kitty Walker in flashback sequences set in 1986. Character history =Background= Kitty Walker is the second eldest of the Walker family, born in late September 1968, although she is the first child of William and Nora (as Sarah Walker was not William's biological child). Kitty shared the conservative beliefs of her father, William, and brother, Tommy. Being Republican, Kitty always clashed with her mother, Nora, who is more liberal. Even though they love each other, their relationship is somewhat complicated. One of the reasons for their misunderstanding was because of younger brother Justin. Kitty supported his decision to join the army whereas Nora was completely against it, especially after Justin was deployed to Afghanistan. From that point until Kitty's return to Los Angeles the two had barely spoken to each other. Until she returned for a visit for her birthday, Kitty had not been home in several years. She had been living in New York City, and witnessed the fall of the Twin Towers during the September 11 attacks. =Season 1= Kitty quit her job in New York City as a radio host after she was offered the opportunity to be a part of the political show (Red, White and Blue) in Los Angeles, despite the fact that her then fianc√©, Jonathan, didn't want her to. Unable to work things out, they broke up. After the sudden death of her father, Kitty discovered, along with the rest of the Walker family, that her father had been cheating on her mother and had embezzled money from the company pension fund, putting the family business at risk. Feeling betrayed and vulnerable, Kitty slept with cohost Warren Salter, further complicating things with Jonathan, who wanted to reconcile with her. Soon after, they ultimately decided it was for the best if they broke up permanently. Jonathan returned to New York. Kitty was therefore free to pursue an affair with Warren but he was hesitant, as he was already involved with his young assistant, Amber. Warren finally asked Kitty out, and she accepted on the condition that he set things straight with Amber. When Kitty discovered that he didn't do so, she realized they didn't have a future together. When Kitty's brother Justin was called to fight in Iraq, she asked one of her guests, Senator Robert McCallister, for his help, but he refused. After another failed attempt to make him change his mind, Kitty apologized in front of her audience. Even though she admitted she had made a mistake, she didn't regret it and decided to leave the show. Robert was nonetheless impressed by her frankness. After much persuasion from Robert, Kitty became his communications director. Even though it was obvious that they were attracted to each other, Kitty was reticent at first, wanting to take a \\"man fast\\". The two of them nevertheless started dating soon after. Most recently after the campaign helicopter that she and Robert were scheduled to fly on crashed, Kitty asked McCallister to marry her. Later, the Senator proposed and Kitty accepted. =Season 2= In Season 2, Kitty continues to plan her wedding to Robert, but when she discovers she is pregnant, the wedding is pushed forward to save the Senator from scandal of having a child out of wedlock. When Kitty eventually miscarries her child, the wedding is put off. After Kitty and Robert marry, their main goal is to have another child; after in vitro fertilization fails, the couple decide to look at adoption. Kitty is also revealed to have written a tell all book about the campaign with Robert and calls in an old friend, Isaac Marshall (played by Danny Glover) to help with the press and Robert's political image. When brother Kevin marries Scotty at the end of the season, it's Kitty who performs the ceremony. =Season 3= In Season 3, Kitty and Robert are married and starting the adoption process. She asks Sarah to write a recommendation for her and Robert. However, Sarah asks Nora to do it as she doesn't have time. Kitty, suspicious, questions Sarah about the letter and finds out that Nora wrote it, leading to a slight rift between them. Sarah then writes the letter. Later, Robert tells Kitty that he has heard rumours that someone in his administration has written a book about his failed presidential campaign. It is revealed that Kitty wrote the book and accidentally leaves it at her mother's home. Nora and Justin read the book and tell the others. They read the book and see that Kitty is talking about them negatively. Kitty and Robert then have them all over for a regular Walker dinner for the social worker. The dinner goes horribly, Nora spills water on the social worker, who leaves. Nora and Kitty then get into an argument. Robert, to everyone's surprise, stands up to Nora and defends Kitty. She explains that she used her family to describe certain aspects about the typical voter. Robert, who is slightly angry about the book, reads it and tells her it's brilliant. However, if Kitty publishes it, she will have to resign as his Communications Director. In the episode \\"Bakersfield\\", Kitty is upset because Robert told her he was going to Washington but, in fact, went to Iraq to see the effects of the war. She is initially hurt, fearing he will always put his career ahead of his family. While Robert is away, Kitty gets a call from the adoption agency with the news that a woman who is six months pregnant would like them to have her child. When she calls Robert with the news, his overjoyed reaction persuades her to forgive him. When Robert returns to the States, they set up a meeting with the birth mother at the hospital she works at. She is a brain surgeon who plainly didn't have time for the baby. After the conversation, everything seemed to be going well and both parties were excited. This was until Kitty decided to go back to the hospital and question Trish (the birth mother) if she was 100% sure that she would go through with the adoption, and Trish was insulted that Kitty would doubt her. She ultimately told Kitty that she would find another set of adoption parents. Kitty was devastated that she had messed their chance up and Robert was upset with Kitty for returning to the hospital without discussing it with him. In a later episode, Trish phoned Robert and Kitty apologizing for \\"freaking out\\" when Kitty had questioned her, and thanked her for giving her a chance to rethink her decision, which remained the same. She told them that if they can trust her again, she would be happy to give them her baby. Although Robert was skeptical, Kitty was elated. After Robert suffers a heart attack, her and Robert's marriage begins to deteriorate as he sinks into a deep depression and secretly launches plans to run for governor of California, and Kitty is left to deal with a recovering Robert and their infant son, Evan. She then meets a man named Alec who is a single father and they slowly bond and become flirtatious. When Robert eventually discovers things it snaps him out of his depression but he becomes upset with Kitty. While in Mexico visiting Tommy, he asks her if she loves him and at first she doesn't know but chases after him, only to find herself too late as his chopper has already taken off. =Season 4= In season 4, it is known that Kitty has been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which will bring the family closer than ever. She starts chemotherapy, then considers stopping it in lieu of herbal remedies and positive thinking. She discovers hair loss from the treatment and shaves her head. She, Robert and Evan all move in with Nora during Kitty's treatment so she can help with Evan during Kitty's weakened state. Though the cancer is seemingly awful news it seems to bring Kitty and Robert closer and repairs their relationship. On the day of Justin and Rebecca's wedding Kitty learns that the chemotherapy has not worked and that in fact her cancer has spread. However, she purposely neglects to tell Robert and her family because she doesn't want to spoil the occasion. During the ceremony as she is reading a poem by e.e. cummings, Kitty passes out and her family rushes to her aid. Justin reveals that she isn't breathing and starts mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Kitty is resuscitated at the hospital where her doctor reveals that her cancer has indeed advanced and spread and suggests a dangerous bone marrow transplant, which Kitty favors but Nora doesn't. Robert becomes angry with Kitty for keeping her advanced cancer from him, but they reconcile and he asks her to renew their vows when Kitty chooses the bone marrow transplant over more chemo-therapy. However, all the Walker siblings are tested and it is revealed that none of them are a match. In desperation Nora turns to Ryan and asks him to get tested and it is revealed that he is a match but doesn't want to donate his marrow as he blames the Walkers (in place of William) for his mother's suicide. Nora tries to tell him that she is angry with William as well but that he must move on. Nora also tells Ryan that by not helping Kitty, Evan will lose his mother, like Ryan did. However, it appears he leaves town in order to escape his sabotaging the wine at Ojai. Just as everyone begins to lose hope, Ryan returns after sorting through what Nora said and donates his marrow to his half-sister. The story then jumps three weeks later as Robert holds a press conference, it is revealed that the transplant was a success and Robert concedes his bid for governor and Ryan seemingly makes amends with the Walker family. Kitty has since begun to run for Robert's senate seat after he decided to step down. Robert is now involved with a group trying to gather evidence on Stanton, a politician. After he catches on to Robert he threatens to derail Kitty's campaign should he go ahead with his information. In the season finale, the Walker family is involved in a massive highway accident. Robert is severely injured, but persuades Justin, who is a med student, to help the others while he waits for an ambulance. Kitty stays with Robert in the car and pleads with him to survive. =Season 5= A year later, Kitty is tending to Robert, who has been in a vegetative coma since the accident. She insists he can recover, ignoring the rest of the family's doubts. She's offered a job taking his spot in the RNC, but she refuses as it would take her away from him. She blames Justin for what happened, saying Justin should have tended to Robert at the accident site, but Justin replies Robert wanted him to help Holly. A talk with Nora makes Kitty realize Robert will never wake up and finally decides to shut off his life support. Mourning her husband, she decides she'll be okay as she prepares to move on with her life. Eventually she rents a house in Ojai to 'find herself' again. She meets a man, Jack, and they become romantically involved. Kitty is initially worried that their relationship won't work because of their different personalities. Jack reveals that he used to work in the city and would move back there if he got to be with Kitty. Once there, however, he begins to become heavily involved in his job and makes plans to move to a different country. Kitty says she can't go because of her family and her son. When they realize that their lives are at different points, they end their relationship. Soon after this, Kitty is offered a job as a lecturer at Waxley University, which she accepts. Whilst there, a young graduate student named Seth asks her out. Although hesitant because of their age gap, Kitty agrees to go out with him. Their relationship goes well until she finds out his mother is the Dean at Waxley and worries she may lose her job. It turns out that she believes her son is not good enough for Kitty, which only makes Kitty more sure of her feelings. When Kitty leaves for DC, she tells her family she is going for business meetings and breaks things off with Seth. It is later revealed that there were some complications with her bone marrow and her cancer was at risk of returning. Once being given the all clear, she returns home and asks Seth for another chance to which he agrees. They then take a trip to Boston together. Kitty returns to support Sarah when she finds out that Brody is her father. On Sarah's wedding day, she reveals that she is pregnant with Seth's child.

The route travelled through the northern part of Essex County and through south-central Chatham-Kent, extending from Windsor to Blenheim. The route's function within the provincial transportation network was eventually superseded by Highway 401, and the highway was decommissioned in 1970. The road is now in operation solely as county roads. It is known as County Road 46 in Essex, and Kent Road 8 in Chatham-Kent.  Route description  Highway 98 travelled from Windsor to Blenheim via Maidstone, Tilbury, Merlin and Charing Cross. The route is known by various names today: Howard Avenue, Provincial Road, Middle Road and Middle Line; as well as by various designations: Essex County Road 46 and Chatham- Kent Road 8\\\\. The route began in downtown Windsor at the intersection of Ouellette Avenue and Riverside Drive. That intersection also served as the terminus for Highway 3B, Highway 18, and Highway 39; Highway 2 continued through the intersection to meet Highway 3 at the Ambassador Bridge. Highway 2, Highway 3B, Highway 39 and Highway 98 travelled south concurrently along Oulette Avenue to Tecumseh Boulevard, at which point Highway 3B branched west along that road while the others turned east. At Howard Avenue, Highway 39 continued east while Highway 2 and Highway 98 turned south. They travelled concurrently to Cabana Road / Division Road, where Highway 2 split onto Division Road and Highway 98 onto Provincial Road. Highway 98 left Windsor as it encountered an interchange with Highway 401 (Exit 14). It travelled southeast, parallel to and north of Highway 3, to Maidstone. There, the highway curved and became Middle Road. It followed this road east, occasionally jogging northeast, while passing through Comber and south of Tilbury, where it left Essex County and entered what is now the municipality of Chatham-Kent. Continuing east, now as Middle Line, the route encountered the communities of Valetta, Stewart and Merlin before curving northeast. It bisected South Buxton before encountering Charing Cross and turning east. It continued for a short distance into Blenheim, where it ended at Highway 3 (Talbot Street).  History  This road's purpose was to be an alternate route for people travelling on Highways 2 and 3 before Highway 401 opened in 1952. The highway's original length was only 55 km (stretching from Windsor to Tilbury), and was originally known as Highway 2A from 1929 to 1938. In 1941, the road was extended by 40 km when a new township road in Kent County, extending to Blenheim, was uploaded as Highway 98. This brought the highway up to its maximum length,. Originally, this road was designated as Highway 2. When Highway 2 was first numbered (in 1925, though it was in provincial power since 1917), it started at the ferry dock between Dougall Avenue and Ouellette Avenue in downtown Windsor, concurrent with Highway 3. Highways 2 and 3 travelled down Ouellette Avenue to Tecumseh Road, where it made a short three- block jog west to Dougall Avenue. It then travelled south to Talbot Road, and headed east along Talbot Road to Malden Road in Maidstone. From here, Highways 2 and 3 parted ways. Highway 3 continued to Essex and Leamington (via County Road 34's present alignment), while Highway 2 travelled up Malden Road to Middle Road (Essex CR 46), and continued to Tilbury, Chatham, London and points east. Before 1929, Highway 18 connected Windsor to Tilbury along today's County Road 42/Division Road, while Highways 2 and 3 were concurrent along Ouellette Avenue from the Ferry Docks (located between Howard Avenue and Ouellette Avenue) to Talbot Road. They split company at Maidstone (today's junction of County Road 34 and Former Highway 114). Highway 3 would continue through Essex, Ontario to Leamington and points east, while Highway 2 followed Malden Road (Former Highway 114) to Middle Road (What would become Highway 2A, then Highway 98, ultimately today's County Road 46). = 1929: The Great Renumbering = In 1929, the Ambassador Bridge opened, offering the first direct and permanent link to Detroit. This caused a cascade of route re- numberings in the Windsor and Maidstone areas. Highway 2 was rerouted along North Talbot Road, and diverted onto the newly built Provincial Road, leading northwest to Howard Avenue. At Howard, the road turned west along Tecumseh Road to Ouellette Avenue, turning north and terminating at the ferry docks. Highway 3 would be routed along the newly built Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge. Since Base Line Road (today's County Road 42/Division Road) was much quicker than Highway 2's former alignment along Middle Road, the province decided to extend Highway 18 from Tilbury to Leamington, and to have Highway 2 absorb its Windsor-Tilbury segment. The former routing of Highway 2 (along Middle Road) became Highway 2A (then Highway 98, and today's CR 46). In 1931, Highway 2 was re-routed along County Road 42's current path, and the precursor to Highway 98 was re-designated as Highway 2A, and this lasted until 1939, when it was re-designated as Highway 98. = Replacement by Highway 401 = When the section of Highway 401 opened in 1952 between Windsor and Tilbury, traffic began to decline, favouring the more direct and faster freeway over the two-lane road. Upon the completion of Highway 401's four lanes (having been twinned in 1965), traffic declined rather sharply, and this once-important alternate highway had lost its reason for existence, almost overnight. It was downgraded and removed from the provincial highway network in early 1970. Until the great highway downgrading spree of 1997-98, this was the longest provincial highway entirely lost to downgrading. Today the route is split into Essex County Road 46 and Chatham-Kent Municipal Road 8.

Henry Pierce refused to sell her, even for the $20,000 offered him in 1903. Ten days after this offer was made, Pierce suddenly died in San Francisco. All his stock was sold at a dispersal sale in Cleveland. C.K.G. Billings bought Lou Dillon, and she again went into training with Millard Sanders. Billings, too, refused to race her professionally. She did run at track races in nearby trials. In 1903, she became the first trotter to register 2:00 for the mile. On October 24, 1903, she bettered her mark, running 1:58¬Ω at Memphis. Four days later in Memphis, she raced and won. With her new-found fame, she began an exhibition tour of the United States and Europe, driven by Billings and Sanders. Her stops included Berlin, Moscow and Vienna. In 1904, she was involved in a doping scandal at the Memphis Gold Cup (innocently -- a rival doped her to prevent her from winning). She was retired in 1906 and died at the age of 26 in 1925. She was buried in Santa Barbara, near where Lou Dillon Lane is found today. She was elected to the Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1955. Her original gravestone is now on display at the Santa Barbara fairgrounds.

Pierre set a world-record cliff jump of at the Grand Targhee Resort in Wyoming. He skied away with a bleeding cut lip from being hit by a shovel when his partners dug him out of his 12-foot bomb hole. Google's Sergey Brin had estimated that Pierre was almost at terminal velocity when he hit the ground. Pierre died in November 2011 in an avalanche.  Life  Matthew Jamison Pierre was born February 22, 1973. According to the London Daily Telegraph, out of eight children, Jamie was third; he was born a son of Pam and Gerard Pierre. Jamie started skiing at age ten at Buck Hill, Minnesota, and quickly picked up the craving for more. He graduated high school and decided to live life as a \\"skibum\\". Jamie worked menial jobs to pay for his expensive passion at various resorts with his brother, Chris Pierre. In 1995, he was able to enter an extreme skiing competition, the beginning to many adventures. Jamie Pierre spent the next ten years progressing his skiing and the size of cliffs he jumped. However, at age 32 in 2005 he got married and had a daughter. Pierre decided, \\"The plan is to ski more, fall out of the sky less\\".  Film career  By being one of the few skiers known for going the biggest, Pierre played a key role in some of the major ski films of his time. This work included parts in many different film companies, including Warren Miller, Teton Gravity Research, Matchstick Productions Flying Circus and Rage Films. While working for Warren Miller, Pierre took parts in five movies: Cold Fusion in 2001, Journey in 2003, Off the Grid in 2006, Playground in 2007 and Children of Winter in 2008.  World Record Huck  Jamie Pierre was known for pushing the limits of skiing off cliffs. He began to be followed by the media in 1999 when a black and white photo appeared in Powder Magazine of Pierre leaping off a forty-foot cliff. The size of the cliffs he was jumping were increasing quickly, starting at 50 feet, and soon were up to 90 feet. His first 100 footers were off of crags in Utah. \\"Pierre began to question how high he could go. What were the limits?\\" Soon Jamie Pierre was jumping a cliff 165 feet in Wolverine Cirque Utah; he cleared this monster cliff in 2003. In Engelberg, Switzerland he cleared a 185-foot cliff around March 2004. Before settling down, Pierre wanted to go big, bigger than anyone else had before. The record at the time was jumped at 225 feet and Jamie Pierre wanted to beat it. After scoping out many cliffs, he finally decided on one, a 255 footer in the backcountry of Grand Targhee resort. \\"Hail Mary\\" are the words Jamie yelled before hucking his body off this world record cliff. Around a dozen people were watching, including photographers, family, friends, and spectators. Plunging headfirst into the snow, Jamie Pierre got that three seconds of the feeling he had always craved. Finally, he held the world record for tallest cliff drop on skis on Jan 25, 2006. In 2008 Fred Syversen beat this record by surviving a 351-foot cliff, albeit unintentionally.  Death  On November 13, 2011, Jamie Pierre was hiking at Snowbird Resort in Utah to snowboard some early season snow. The resort was not open and no avalanche control had been done. Pierre and his friend, Jack Pilot, were planning to ski the area known as South Chute. He triggered an avalanche that rolled him over rocks for 800 feet. According to The New York Times, \\"He came to a stop partly buried and died of trauma\\". He is survived by his wife, and two children, a daughter and a son.

It reached number 26 on the Billboard Top Album Tracks chart. By coincidence, it also reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1985, and remains their most successful release in the United Kingdom to date. Rock 'n' Roll fairy tale \\"Rock 'N' Roll Children\\" is a song exemplary of Dio‚Äôs style of blending the theme of rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll with fantasy elements. It is about boy and a girl, meant for each other and at the same time hostile opposites, ending up alone in the dark. The song seems to be closely connected to the song \\"Sacred Heart\\" from the same album, which is about a quest imposed by a wizard to find the sacred heart bleeding in the night; in \\"Rock 'N' Roll Children\\" the fall in the darkness of the couple is expressed as the breaking of a heart. Some of the elements in the lyrics of the song \\"Sacred Heart\\" are used in the music video of \\"Rock 'N' Roll Children\\". In this video, two kids get in an argument because the boy is planning on quitting his rock 'n' roll music career for a steady job and his girl accuses him of \\"selling out\\". A rainstorm comes up and the two seek shelter inside an antique store named Curios. The store belongs to the wizard played by Ronnie James Dio, who seems to have some secret involvement in the matter of their trouble. They hide in a closet and disappear in the nightmare world of the wizard, separate from each other. This dark world of the wizard reflects ordinary society, a hostile world for children of rock 'n' roll, because they don‚Äôt want to be enslaved by its rules and authority figures (such as parents and teachers). In the end, the boy and girl find each other and make up with the implication that the boy will return to his previous career in rock 'n' roll. The wizard's game is over until the next passerby enters his store.

The main subjects of his studies were the painters Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca.Longhi, Roberto Dictionary of Art Historians Early life and career Longhi was born in December 1890 in Alba in Piedmont. His parents were from Emilia. He studied with Pietro Toesca, in Turin, and Adolfo Venturi in Rome. The latter made him book reviews editor of the journal L'Arte in 1914. Between 1913 and 1917, Longhi, primarily an essayist, published text in L'Arte and La Voce on Mattia Preti, Piero della Francesca, Orazio Borgianni and Orazio Gentileschi. Over the course of his career Longhi developed a fascination with Caravaggio and his followers. his book Quesiti caravaggeschi [Questions on Caravaggio] (1928‚Äì34), was followed by Ultimi studi caravaggeschi [Latest Caravaggio studies] (1943). In 1951, Longhi curated a ground-breaking exhibition on Caravaggio at the Royal Palace in Milan, Mostra di Caravaggio e dei Caravaggeschi. In 1968 he authored a monograph on the artist. Whilst establishing himself as a notable Caravaggio scholar, Longhi retained a lively interest in Piero della Francesca, editing a monograph in 1928, representing him as the leading painter of the Quattrocento. Longhi believed Piero della Francesca played a decisive role in the development of Venetian painting. This monograph, which Kenneth Clark opined could hardly be improved upon, established itself as a classic of art-historical literature. Between 1920 and 1922, Longhi made a Grand Tour of Europe. He never visited Russia, nor some American collections, like the Kress Collection of the National Gallery, Washington. However, his first-hand viewing of many works, like those in the Borghese Gallery in Rome, led to the rediscovery of many lost masterpieces such as two panels of a Giotto altarpiece. Longhi also rekindled interest in a large number of followers of Caravaggio, such as Hendrick ter Brugghen (he edited a monograph in 1927) and some painters from Ferrara. His book Officina Ferrarese (1934) still stands as an exemplary study. Along with the publication of the Officina, Longhi started his academic career, first as Professor at Bologna University (from 1935), and later in Florence. In 1950, Longhi co-founded and edited with Anna Banti Paragone, a bi-monthly magazine on art and literature still running to these days. Longhi also curated a number of exhibitions, including Mostra della pittura bolognese del Trecento (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna, 1948); I pittori della realt√† in Lombardia (Palazzo Reale, Milan, 1953); and Arte lombarda dai Visconti agli Sforza (Palazzo Reale, Milan, 1958).

Controversy over the product's origins The origin of the recipe is disputed by Tony Bailey, who runs a West Indian takeaway in Brixton, South London. In 2010, Bailey filed a preliminary claim in the High Court for more than ¬£300,000 claiming that, as the inventor of the sauce, he was entitled to a share of profits. Roots ran a jerk chicken stall at the Notting Hill Carnival for 15 years with Bailey. Levi Roots gave evidence to the High Court and admitted that previous claims made by him on Dragons Den and in marketing for his product, including the claim that the recipe was his grandmother's, were untrue. Judge Mark Pelling QC dismissed Bailey's claims for breach of contract and breach of confidence. He told the court: \\"This was a dishonest claim, dishonestly advanced.\\" No evidence had been offered to support Bailey's claim that he was the original inventor of the sauce. Lawyers said they estimated the legal battle had cost more than ¬£1m in total and the judge said Roots was entitled to have his costs paid.  Production and expansion  Reggae Reggae Sauce is manufactured by AB World Foods, a division of Associated British Foods. Despite Levi saying he wanted production of his sauce to continue in the UK, production moved from Wales to Poland in March 2007. Initially the sauce was carried exclusively in Sainsbury's supermarkets but now many supermarkets in the UK and Ireland stock the sauce. A follow-up episode of Dragons' Den, aired on 18 July 2007, revealed that Sainsbury's had expected the sauce to sell 50,000 bottles in its first year but instead sold 40,000-50,000 bottles per week. In the first half of 2008, Roots launched \\"Love Apple Tomato Sauce\\" and \\"Fiery Guava Dipping Sauce\\" in the same style as Reggae Reggae sauce. A cookbook called Reggae Reggae Cookbook was released in June 2008. The \\"Love Apple Tomato Sauce\\" was later renamed \\"Reggae Reggae Tomato Ketchup\\". Restaurants Subway,Subway adds Reggae Reggae-branded spicy sub Brand Republic Hungry Horse and pub chains Slug and Lettuce and Scream offer the sauce on various menu items. In July 2009, Birds Eye released chicken Chargrills in Reggae Reggae Sauce. In the summer of 2010, snacks were added to the range of products with the launch of Reggae Reggae Peanuts and Cashews. These peanuts are covered in the original Reggae Reggae Sauce and seasonings. Subsequently a range of Reggae Reggae flavoured Caribbean ready meals was launched.Levi Launches Chilled Caribbean Meals Range Reggae Reggae In September 2010, Morrisons supermarket announced it would be carrying a range of Levi Roots sandwiches. In April 2011, Domino's Pizza in the UK launched a limited edition \\"Reggae Reggae Pizza\\", a combination of toppings with the Reggae Reggae sauce.Domino‚Äôs gets set to launch the new Reggae Reggae pizza Pizza News In 2012, KFC launched a Reggae Reggae box meal. The range has expanded into other areas such as Levi Roots Jamaica Ginger Cake and Levi Roots Caribbean Crush drink which is sold in mainstream UK supermarkets. In 2012, a new \\"Mild\\" variant of the sauce was released.

This album is all written by Nikos Karvelas. In spite of her previous albums, it featured a clear pop sound, very distinctive of Vissi's next albums. The album reached platinum status and was one of the best-selling albums of 1987 in Greece. Album information As the two number one singles from the previous album \\"Kati Simveni\\" were written by Karvelas, her label accepted Vissi's suggestion for the next album to be written entirely by Karvelas. The result was a pop album with 10 songs. Notable is the fact that this is the first album CBS Greece released on CD, simultaneously with the original vinyl release, though it was re-released in 1996. Music Music and lyrics on the album are by Nikos Karvelas. Anna Vissi and Giorgos Mitsigas contributed as the lyricists of two songs. =LP and 1996's CD edition track listing= # \\"I Epomeni Kinisi\\" (The next move) # \\"Se Posa Tablo\\" (How many dashboard) # \\"Otan Kanoume Erota\\" (When we make love) # \\"Skepasto\\" (Covered) # \\"Agapi Kai Misos\\" (Love and hate) # \\"Pragmata\\" (Things) # \\"Apodiksis\\" (Evidence) # \\"S' Agapo Telia Kai Pavla\\" (I love you, period) # \\"Me Agapi Apo Mena Gia Sena\\" (With love from me to you) # \\"Dromos\\" (Road) *All Tracks Arranged by Nikos Karvelas *Music written by Nikos Karvelas *Lyrics: tracks 1‚Äì5, 7, 9‚Äì10, 12 Nikos Karvelas; track 6 Nikos Karvelas, Anna Vissi, Giorgos Mitsigkas; track 8 Giorgos Mitsigkas. =1986's CD edition track listing= When the album was released in a CD in 1986 it featured five tracks as bonus tracks from the album \\"Kati Simveni\\" The track list was as follows: # \\"I Epomeni Kinisi\\" # \\"Se Posa Tablo\\" # \\"Otan Kanoume Erota\\" # \\"Skepasto\\" # \\"Agapi Kai Misos # \\"Pragmata # \\"Apodeikseis # \\"S' Agapo Telia Kai Pavla\\" # \\"Me Agapi Apo Mena Gia Sena\\" # \\"Dromos\\" # \\"Dodeka\\"* # \\"San Ke Mena Kamia\\"* # \\"Kati Simveni\\"* # \\"Ti Eho Na Haso\\"* # \\"Ki Omos Ehis Figi\\"* * Tracks 11‚Äì15 (p) 1985 CBS originally on the album \\"Kati Simveni\\". * Tracks 1‚Äì11 arranged by Nikos Karvelas; tracks 12‚Äì15 arranged by Antonis Vardis.

Recording and composition The duets found on the early albums that Jones and Wynette recorded together feature songs that almost always celebrate the joys of domestic bliss and true love, something producer Billy Sherrill did purposefully to reflect the assumptions of their captivated audience. A good example of this is \\"The Ceremony\\", a song Sherrill co-wrote; the song, which mimics a wedding service, begins with a minister's preamble over a church organ and contains verses where George and Tammy renew their vows and profess their love for each other. It became a highlight of their live shows, with Bob Allen wryly noting in his book George Jones: The Saga of an American Singer: \\"When they sang \\"The Ceremony\\" onstage in places like Sioux City and Peoria, they enacted for the benefit of their fans an elaborate wedding ritual which, in reality, was quite unlike the quickie civil ceremony with which they'd actually sealed their nuptial bond.\\" In 1996 Jones admitted in his autobiography, \\"It sounds cheesy now, but it was a show-stopper for two people whose divorce was often the subject of tabloid speculation. People went crazy when we did 'The Ceremony' live.\\" As if mirroring their doomed marriage, a couple of the songs on Me and the First Lady hint at the cracks that had already appeared in the relationship of country music's first couple: \\"A Lovely Place To Cry\\" (co-written by Wynette with Earl Montgomery) and \\"The Great Divide\\" both contemplate fading love and the possibility of divorce. Reception The album peaked at number six on the Billboard country albums chart. Jones biographer Bob Allen has a dim view of the album, comparing the \\"syrupy\\" songs to \\"two-and-a-half-minute-long musical Cliff's Notes to Harlequin novels.\\" Track listing #\\"We Believe in Each Other\\" (Curly Putman) ‚Äì 2:39 #\\"Lovely Place to Cry\\" (Tammy Wynette, Earl Montgomery) ‚Äì 2:45 #\\"There's Power in Our Love\\" (Montgomery) ‚Äì 2:11 #\\"Perfect Match\\" (Glenn Sutton, Ben Peters) ‚Äì 2:11 #\\"Great Divide\\" (Putman) ‚Äì 2:40 #\\"To Live on Love\\" (Montgomery) ‚Äì 2:57 #\\"You and Me Together\\" (Jimmy Peppers) ‚Äì 1:52 #\\"Lovin' You Is Worth It\\" (Carmol Taylor, Quinton Claunch) ‚Äì 2:28 #\\"We're Gonna Try to Get Along\\" (Peppers) ‚Äì 2:08 #\\"It's Been a Beautiful Life\\" (Taylor, Billy Sherrill) ‚Äì 2:27 #\\"The Ceremony\\" (Taylor, Sherrill, Jenny Strickland) ‚Äì 3:06 Chart positions In 1972, Me and the First Lady peaked at #6 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.

The disorder is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Symptoms include growth abnormalities of the head, face and nails, along with the development of acanthosis nigricans. Treatment involves controlling blood glucose levels by using insulin and incorporating a strategically planned, controlled diet. Also, direct actions against other symptoms may be taken (e.g. surgery for facial abnormalities) This syndrome usually affects children and has a prognosis of 1‚Äì2 years. Symptoms The symptoms of Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome vary from case to case. Major symptoms of Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome include abnormalities of the teeth and nails, such as dental dysplasia, and deformities of the head and face, which include a coarse prematurely-aged facial appearance with a prominent jaw. A skin abnormality known as acanthosis nigricans, which involves a discoloration (hyperpigmentation) and ‚Äúvelvety‚Äù thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin around skin fold regions of the neck, groin and under arms is also a common symptom. Symptoms will negatively impact the daily life of the patient, and will persist until treated. Minor symptoms may include an enlargement of the genitalia and precocious puberty and a deficiency or absence of fat tissue. Because individuals with Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome fail to use insulin properly, they may experience abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) after eating a meal, and abnormally low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) when not eating. Mechanism Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The condition is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, and often affects children of consanguineous parents. The physical findings and symptoms vary greatly among each individual. Genetic diseases are determined by two genes, one from the mother and one from the father. Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits the same abnormal gene for the same trait from each parent. If one of the inherited genes is normal, while the other is for the disease, the person will only be a carrier and will not display any symptoms. The risk for two carrier parents to both pass the defective gene and, therefore, have an affected child is 25 percent with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50 percent with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents and be genetically normal for that particular trait is 25 percent. Researchers have determined that the Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome is caused by mutations of the insulin receptor gene. The insulin receptor gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19. Mutations of the insulin- receptor gene lead to an alteration of structure or reduced number of insulin receptors. This results in reduced binding of insulin, and may also lead to abnormalities in the post-receptor pathway. Individuals with Rabson-Mendenall syndrome will need ways to compensate for their insulin resistance, and may do this by increasing insulin secretion. This can lead to excessive insulin levels in the blood (hyperinsulinemia), which can be responsible for multiple symptoms. Definitive genotype‚Äìphenotype correlation for insulin receptor defects is difficult to establish primarily due to the rarity of these syndromes. However, researchers believe more severe phenotype changes are due to a mutation in the alpha subunit of the receptor. Diagnosis A combination of clinical findings and laboratory tests are used to diagnose Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome. Initially, individuals are screened for symptoms and have their blood sugar levels analyzed. The two principle tests used to determine insulin resistance are the fasting plasma glucose test (FPG) and the oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). Results from a patient with severe insulin resistance will show values exceeding healthy ranges (‚â§99 mg/dL for FPG and ‚â§139 mg/dL for GTT) by over 50 units. A genetic history is also established to determine risk of recurrence in the family. Based on the combination of these findings, an appropriate diagnosis is made. Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome is commonly associated with Donohue syndrome, also known as \\"Leprechaunism\\". Both diseases are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations on chromosome 19. Severe insulin resistance and an irregular enlargement of the genitalia are also overlapping symptoms. = Clinical presentation = Rabson and Mendenhall described 3 sibling (2 girls, 1 boy) who initially presented with dental and skin abnormalities, abdominal distention, and phallic enlargement. The children demonstrated early dentition, a coarse, senile-appearing facies, and striking hirsutism. An \\"adult growth of hair of head\\" at 5 years of age was pictured in the case of one of the girls. In the older girl the genitalia were large enough at the age of 6 months to permit vaginal examination for diagnosis of a left ovarian tumor which was removed soon afterward. The children were mentally precocious. Prognathism and very thick fingernails as well as acanthosis nigricans were also described. Insulin-resistant diabetes developed, and the patients died during childhood of ketoacidosis and intercurrent infections. At autopsy pineal hyperplasia was found in all three. Biologically, infants display fasting hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which progress to permanent hyperglycemia and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis.  Treatment and prognosis There is no known cure for Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome. However, a series of steps can be directed towards treating the specific symptoms. For example, surgery may be performed to treat dental abnormalities. Furthermore, the goal of the treatment is also to maintain blood glucose levels as constantly as possible. Insulin is not as effective at normal doses, and even large doses show minimal effects. Frequent feeding is the most effective treatment to control blood glucose levels. Well thought out meals with complex combinations of carbohydrates are put together and assigned to the patient in hope of seeing a constant glucose level maintained. Though effective, these treatments tend to show more of an impact initially, and can become ineffective within months. Treatment of Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome with pharmacologic doses of human leptin may result in improvement of fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, basal glucose, and glucose and insulin tolerance. Quality of life is impacted severely and the prognosis of patients with Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome remains poor. This is due to the lack of a long-term treatment. Life expectancy is 1‚Äì2 years. Recent research Recent research has been directed towards finding better treatment options. Multi-drug therapy using insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, has been linked to improving residual insulin action. High doses of insulin-like growth factor 1 has also been effective in patients with Rabson‚ÄìMendenhall syndrome. Though there is no cure, researchers remain optimistic on finding a cure.

Economic Policy =End Poverty in 30 Years= One of Edwards' main themes as a political figure is the problem of poverty in America. He believes that poverty can be cut by one third by 2016 and eliminated by 2036. He supports adoption of the National Academy of Science's recommendations for measuring poverty, which he claims would add one million people to the \\"poverty\\" class. His plan involves several tactics, including stronger families; better schools; and the issuance of government-funded housing vouchers. Edwards argues in favor of creating one million housing vouchers over five years in order to place poor people in middle-class neighborhoods and in areas where jobs are available. He also supports strengthening labor unions and raising the minimum wage to $8.40.A National Goal: End Poverty Within 30 Years JohnEdwards.com Edwards has stated, \\"If we truly believe that we are all equal, then we should live together too.\\" =College for everyone= Edwards has stated that if people agree to work part-time during their first year at a public-college, the government should pay for their tuition, books and fees. Edwards has advocated his College for Everyone program based on proposal made in his 2004 campaign and the successful College for Everyone pilot program that Edwards and the Carolina non-profit organization Promise and Opportunity Foundation began at Greene Central High School in Snow Hill, North Carolina, a high school in rural eastern North Carolina with a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students. Under Edwards' College for Everyone program, the government would help all qualified students pay for college tuition, fees and books for college students who agree to work part-time ten hours a week if they \\"complete coursework that prepares them for further education, stay out of trouble, and enroll in a participating public university or community college.\\" Funds would be provided for two million students. Other aspects of the plan include strong preparation in high school, with College for Everyone students being required to complete a college-prep curriculum in high school and Edwards administration \\"working with school districts to strengthen high school curricula.\\" The most significant part of the College for Everyone is its proposed overhaul of the student loan program. Edwards has called for an end to large federal subsidies for banks that make student loans, which would free up $6 billion. Instead, subsidies would be replaced with loans directly from the U.S. Department of Education, \\"receiving loans that have very similar terms but are far less expensive for taxpayers.\\"^source required =Energy Independence and Stopping Global warming= John Edwards' positions on energy are documented on his 2008 Presidential Campaign website.Edwards' campaign positions on energy In March 2007 he was the first presidential candidate to make his campaign \\"carbon neutral.\\" He started buying carbon offsets to reduce his carbon emissions and having his offices buy recycled paper products.Grist Jan. 30, 2008 Retrieved May 1, 2008 http://www.grist.org/feature/2007/07/31/edwards_factsheet/ One of the main focuses of his campaign was fighting global warming. He has said \\"Why has America not addressed global warming in a serious way? There's a very simple answer for that. Oil companies, power companies, gas companies and their lobbyists in Washington, D.C.\\" Friends of the Earth Sep. 16, 2007 retrieved May 1, 2008 http://action.foe.org/content.jsp?content_KEY=3354&t;=FoE_Action_PAC.dwt He voted against drilling in the Arctic five times, and supports the standard that would require renewable sources to be the source of 10 percent of America's electricity by 2020. Edwards endorses the widespread goal of 80% reductions of greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by the year 2050. He has denounced the Bush administration for not signing the Kyoto treaty and supports the McCain-Lieberman bill to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Salon July 20, 2004 retrieved May 1, 2008 This would involve capping emissions, reducing the cap every year, and auctioning off the right to emit a certain quantity of greenhouse gases. He would then use this estimated $10 billion to fund research for alternative energy sources, in an effort to end the United States reliance on imported foreign oil. Social Policy =National Service= John Edwards opposes a military draft.Crawford, Jamie; \\"Edwards critical on talk of draft\\"; cnnpolitics.com; August 12, 2007 =Abortion= Edwards supports legal access to abortion. He received a 100% rating from NARAL each year he was in the Senate, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also supports public funding for abortion services for low-income women.John Edwards (D-NC) NARAL.org Edwards issued a press statement saying he was \\"saddened\\" by the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and described this law as \\"offensive to women.\\" Although absent from the official vote, Edwards had voted against the bill in previous versions. =LGBT issues= During his 2004 Vice Presidential run, Edwards stated he was opposed to same-sex marriage. In late December 2006, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Edwards said, \\"Do I believe they should have the right to marry? I'm just not there yet...\\" Edwards opposes a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, preferring to leave that decision up to individual states. He supports the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). He does support letting states decide on civil unions and partnership benefits. =Immigration= Edwards supported the expansion of the H-1B visa program to increase the number of work visas for immigrant workers.Senator John Edwards Edwards supports expanding legal immigration to the United States while working with Mexico to provide better border security and stop illegal trafficking.Immigration Voting Report Card for Sen. John Edwards On February 7, 2007 Edwards said in a Cox News Service Q&A; that \\"We want to change the immigration system, so people can get on the path to citizenship.\\"Q&A; With John Edwards On Health Care =Civil liberties= Edwards voted in favor of the 2001 version of the USA PATRIOT Act along with all but one senator, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. He subsequently criticized the Bush administration for \\"abusing its powers in implementing the [Patriot Act].\\"Candidate Review MoveOn.org, June 17, 2003 Edwards was no longer in the Senate when the Patriot Act was reauthorized. =Cannabis legalization= Edwards has said he is against the legalization of recreational cannabis.The Candidates on Medical Marijuana - TalkLeft: The Politics Of Crime He currently supports legal use of marijuana for medical purposes. He said that if given doctors' approval, seriously ill patients should be allowed to use marijuana. Health care On February 5, 2007, Edwards unveiled his plan for universal health care. The plan subsidizes health insurance purchases for poorer Americans, requires that all Americans purchase health care, \\"requires that everybody get preventive care,\\" and requires employers to offer health insurance through the Medicare system as one option for their workers. Since Medicare has lower administrative costs ‚Äî under 4%, versus 20% or more for many HMOs ‚Äî Edwards believes that individuals will be able to save on health care by using the public option. While it is not a single-payer plan, the plan states that \\"over time, the system may evolve toward a single-payer approach if individuals and businesses prefer the public plan.\\" and make Medicare the de facto national health program. Edwards said \\"The bottom line is we're asking everybody to share in the responsibility of making health care work in this country. Employers, those who are in the medical insurance business, employees, the American people ‚Äî everyone will have to contribute in order to make this work.\\" The plan includes methods for cutting costs in the health care system and creation of revenue sources. =Cost Containment= There are six ways in which Edwards proposes to reduce costs in the health care system. # Help doctors deliver the best care by researching improvements in health care delivery and disseminating best- practices information. # Invest in preventive care. Require citizens to obtain preventative care; reward citizens who meet \\"healthy living\\" standards. # Allow patients to review a hospital's or doctor's performance. # Work for environmental and health justice by reducing pollution, especially in low- income/minority neighborhoods and support translation services. # Improve productivity with information technology. # Protect patients against dangerous medicines by strengthening the FDA and restricting advertising of drugs. =Revenue sources= The total public cost of the plan would be $90-$120 billion per year, paid for by eliminating the 2001 tax cuts for individuals earning more than $200,000 per year. Employers would be required to either cover their employees or to pay a payroll tax that will be used to partially fund regional health insurance pools (called \\"Health Markets\\") that are overseen by the federal government. Individuals who are not covered by their employers or by an expanded Medicaid program (covering individuals and families with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level) or Medicare will be required to purchase insurance from these Health Markets. Insurance companies must compete to win the right to be one of the providers in these Health Markets and must provide full comprehensive care (including mental health parity). In addition, one of the insurance plans will be directly provided by the federal government (similar to, but separate from Medicare). If a majority of individuals choose to purchase their insurance from the government plan, Edwards has stated that this could eventually lead to a single-payer health care system. In addition, there will also be a broad subsidy for those individuals who have to purchase insurance on their own. The subsidy is given on a sliding scale to individuals and families making up to roughly $100,000 per year (this is a significantly larger subsidy than is provided in the Massachusetts health care plan, another mandated insurance program). Foreign Policy Edwards has criticized the handling of the War on Terrorism by the Bush Administration. Edwards feels that the War on Terrorism was misnamed: \\"It is now clear that George Bush's misnamed 'War on Terror' has backfired ‚Äî and is now part of the problem.\\" He went on later to say, \\"The War on Terror is a slogan designed only for politics, not a strategy to make America safe. It's a bumper sticker, not a plan.\\" =Iraq= Edwards voted for the 2002 Iraq War Resolution, and was one of 16 Senators to co-sponsor an early version of that bill, Joe Lieberman's S.J Res 46, which was not brought to the floor for a vote.S.J.RES.46 - Co-sponsors Library of Congress Three years after the war began, in November 2005, Edwards said that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. He apologized for his vote, saying that the intelligence reports which led to the decision were \\"deeply flawed and, in some cases, manipulated to fit a political agenda.\\" He favors gradual troop withdrawal and concurrent training of Iraqi troops, as well as removing American contractors, instead awarding such reconstruction contracts to Iraqi businesses to promote the Iraqi economy and reduce unemployment in Iraq.Edwards, John; \\"The Right Way In Iraq,\\" The Washington Post; November 13, 2005 Page B07. On January 14, 2007 Edwards spoke at New York City's Riverside Church as keynote speaker at a Martin Luther King Day commemoration. In the speech Edwards criticized silence on the \\"escalation of the war in Iraq,\\" reminding people about King's vocal opposition to the Vietnam War forty years earlier. In a February 2007 appearance on Meet the Press, Edwards told Tim Russert, \\"over time, when I reflected on what I thought was going to be necessary going forward, to have some moral foundation to work on issues like poverty and genocide, things that I care deeply about, I could no longer defend this vote. It was pretty simple. And I got to the place I felt like I had to say it and had to say it publicly. And so‚Äî what? ‚Äî a year ‚Äî a year or so ago I did that.\\" He subsequently apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards was a vocal critic of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, calling the surge the \\"McCain Doctrine\\" in reference to Sen. John McCain's support for the strategy. He has stated that he cannot guarantee to pull all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the end of the next presidential term in 2013, but added he would \\"immediately draw down 40,000 to 50,000 troops.\\"Top Democratic candidates won't vow full Iraq pullout by 2013 In October 2007, Edwards called for limits on the role of private military contractors in Iraq and elsewhere.Edwards: Limit Private Security Firms by Philip Elliott, Associated Press, October 2, 2007. At the beginning of 2008, Edwards proposed withdrawal of all troops from Iraq in the first 10 months if he became president. Despite President Bush's vetoes of funding bills with withdrawal timetables, Edwards urged Congressional Democrats to not acquiesce, but instead to continually present bills that include such timetables. Crime When asked how to prevent inner city kids from participating in violence, Edwards said, with implied criticism of \\"The idea that we're just gonna keep incarcerating, keep incarcerating, pretty soon we're not going to have a young African-American male population in America. They're all going to be in prison, or dead. One of the two.\\" Instead of supporting such a notion, he said the government should spend more money on health care and education in order to prevent young people from leading a life of crime.John Edwards: The MTV/MySpace Presidential Dialogue The Media Edwards supports net neutrality. In addition, he has outlined a plan that will establish high-speed internet availability to all American homes and business by the year 2010.Issues - Open Media JohnEdwards.com He is also a vocal critic of the Fox News Channel. He has accused the network of having a \\"right-wing agenda\\" and lacking objectivity in their reporting.Statement on Edwards' Decision Not to Participate in Fox Debate , JohnEdwards.com, Apr 6, 2007 He has boycotted debates hosted by the network, saying \\"there's just no reason for Democrats to give Fox a platform.\\"Edwards to Skip Nevada Debate Hosted by Fox, The Washington Post, March 7, 2007Edwards Pulls Out of Fox News Debate, The New York Times, April 8, 2007 References  External links *JohnEdwards.com - Issues **JohnEdwards.com - Health Care Plan * On the Issues issue positions * Project Vote Smart candidate information including issue positions * Reengaging With the World an article by John Edwards in Foreign Affairs * John Edwards' positions on top foreign policy issues by Council on Foreign Relations Category:Political positions of the 2008 United States presidential candidates Category:Political positions of United States senators Political positions ","title":"Political positions of John Edwards"},{"id":"9920593","text":"Steven Nash Jackson (born March 15, 1982) is a former American Major League Baseball pitcher.

In the United States, a county is an administrative or political subdivision of a U.S. state that consists of a geographic region with specific boundaries and usually some level of governmental authority. Most counties have subdivisions which may include townships, municipalities, and unincorporated areas.

Presentation In the leukocytes, the presence of very small rods (around 3 micrometers), or D√∂hle-like bodies can be seen in the cytoplasm. Pathogenesis MHA is believed to be associated with the MYH9 gene. The pathogenesis of the disorder had been unknown until recently, when autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) were identified. Unique cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are aggregates of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, and are only present in granulocytes. It is not yet known why inclusion bodies are not present in platelets, monocytes, and lymphocytes, or how giant platelets are formed. MYH9 is also found to be responsible for several related disorders with macrothrombocytopenia and leukocyte inclusions, including Sebastian, Fechtner, and Epstein syndromes, which feature deafness, nephritis, and/or cataract. MHA is also a feature of the Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis with sensorineural hearing loss).Noris P et al.

Two space monkeys can be seen in the upper third of this image. \\"I'm Always Changing For You.\\" A snapshot of an individual square from the OMM on May 10, 2007). There are literally layers of hidden depth below the surface of this picture. The One Million Masterpiece (abbreviated OMM) is the largest artistic collaboration ever attempted. It is an ongoing project to produce a true piece of global artwork. As of October 16, 2007, 26,582 artists from 174 countries have participated, with $19,348.57 raised for charities worldwide. The original project website was launched on July 14, 2006 by London-based artist Paul Fisher. The site uses an Adobe Flash drawing tool to enable members to contribute images drawn on screen using a mouse or digipad, and an AJAX viewer which displays the whole artwork mosaic. The website has developed and further social networking elements have been added. Artists can rate one another's contributions, communicate via messages and maintain a profile page. Participation Participation is free to anyone with access to the internet. Participants are each given a square where they can use a built-in drawing tool to create an image. (These individual images combined are what will make up the final project as a giant mosaic.) The project is open to, and intended for, all willing participants. One need not be artistically trained, in order to participate. Celebrity Involvement Celebrity contributors include Peaches Geldof, electric violinist Linzi Stoppard, playwright Tom Stoppard, doctor and health commentator Miriam Stoppard, Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman and artist Holly Johnson, cult comedy icon Karl Pilkington, businessman and socialite Sebastien Sainsbury and Supremes band member Susaye Greene. Aims Artistic and Charitable The One Million Masterpiece aims to produce a piece of public artwork that will provide a snapshot of global society. It is intended that the final artwork be completed for unveiling on World Population Day 2008 and hopes to raise over $1 million for the projects charity partners Save the Children, Oxfam, ActionAid and World Cancer Research Fund. World Record The artwork also officially qualifies as a new world record. The previous official record for the most artists completing a single picture was held by the painting A Little Dab of Texas, designed by Jim Campbell of Brenham, Texas, United States. The picture was painted by 25,297 people and was completed in 3 years, 7 months on June 14, 1998. Recurring Elements Within Image (Space Monkeys) As the project is still underway, it is largely wondered whether the final image will have a thematic unity or if it will be a chaotic series of unrelated images. Many recurring elements can be found throughout the work. The most notable of these recurring elements are what have been dubbed \\"space monkeys.\\" Space monkeys are small circular faces, typically cartoonish in nature and rudimentary in style. They are believed to have originated within Laura Dixon's picture‚Äîbut they soon began to appear in pictures throughout the project. Other common recurring elements include: views of the earth from space, eyes, hearts, and flowers. Video Replay of Drawing Process The OMM site's adobe drawing tool includes a feature that enables a video replay of the drawing process for each picture. This feature has led several participants to not only create digital paintings, but also digital videos. Angeli Arndt uses this feature in her artwork entitled \\"I'm Always Changing For You,\\" to show a human face changing over time. This video functionality adds a dimension to the project that is not noticeable when simply viewing still images of the project. Exhibition When completed The One Million Masterpiece will measure 80 metres in width and 31 meters in height and each individual contribution will be a 5 cm by 5 cm square. It is proposed that the final piece will be printed and unveiled in Central London on World Population Day 2008. Controversy There has been controversy within the OMM community regarding content of individual artworks. Some participants have complained that certain artworks are pornographic and/or obscene. Occasionally, a participant will demand that the artwork of another participant be deleted.

The release was Jones' 46th studio album release since a debut from 16 years previous. Also as a highlight in his career, it was the first release made on Jones' new label, Epic Records. The album charted very well for a George Jones album, eventually rising to #10 on the country charts. The album included some other artist's hits from 1971, including Charley Pride's \\"Kiss an Angel Good Morning\\" and former Jones Boys bass player, Johnny Paycheck's \\"She's All I Got\\". Its title track \\"We Can Make It\\" peaked out at #6 on the US Country chart. Background For years, Jones had been staying back while his long-time manager and producer, Pappy Daily, made deal after deal with label after label. After taking him to Mercury (1957-1962) Daily signed Jones to United Artists (1962-1964) where he saw his biggest success during the 1960s. After leaving UA in early '64, he signed with Musicor Records (1964-1971), and saw a dropoff of his sound quality and sales. However, his biggest success was yet to come, and it would start with his third wife, Tammy Wynette. The two often crossed paths during tours, and Jones proclaimed his love for her in 1969, and the two later married. It was through their inseparable relationship that Jones met Wynette's producer, Billy Sherrill. Soon, the two began recording, and he even became Jones's producer full-time, having him sign with Epic Records (1972-1991). Soon after signing, Sherrill began producing the album's track recordings. Recording and composition =Recording= George Jones recorded in a session in November 1971, which wrapped up 8 songs, all of which were included: \\"I'll Take You My World\\", \\"Kiss An Angel Good Morning\\", \\"All the Praises\\", \\"She's All I Got\\", \\"The Last Letter\\", \\"The King\\", \\"Try It, You'll Like It\\", and the final cut, \\"Let's Make History\\". His very next session was recorded on January 12, 1972, where he recorded \\"We Can Make It\\" and \\"One of These Days\\". The final recording was made during a session on February 10, which cut \\"Loving You Could Never Be Better\\". All the tracks were recorded at the Columbia Recording Studio; 804 16th Ave. South, in Nashville, Tennessee. =Composition= Side one tracks Most of the tracks are previous hits, and nearly all the songs listed were written by different songwriters: \\"We Can Make It\\" was written by the album's producer Billy Sherrill alongside Glenn Sutton. The song is the best efforts by Jones of his early years with Epic. It was released in February 1972 and peaked at #6 on the US Country chart. The two also wrote the next song on the album, \\"I'll Take You to My World\\". \\"Kiss An Angel Good Morning\\" was a #1 hit with Charley Pride in 1971, and written by Ben Peters. \\"All the Praises\\" was written by J. Strickland and was later recorded by Connie Smith for one of her LP releases in 1973. During the mid to the late-1960s, Jones toured and recorded with Johnny Paycheck as a key member in his Jones Boys Band, often singing backup in studio sessions and live performances. After leaving the Boys in 1969, he went to pursue his own career, which basically launched with his first Top 10 chart since 1966. \\"She's All I Got\\" peaked at #2 after being written by Gary Bonds and Jerry Williams. Side two tracks \\"The Last Letter\\" was written by Rex Griffin. The next track listed is \\"Loving You Could Never Be Better\\", which displays Jones's love for his new wife, Tammy. The song was written by Betty Belew with C. and Earl Montgomery. \\"The King\\" was written by Roger D. Ferris in 1970. The next upbeat listing was \\"Try It, You'll Like It\\", which was written by Jimmy Peppers and later included as the b-side track to \\"We Can Make It\\". Track 10 was \\"One Of These Days\\" written by Earl Montgomery, and the last track \\"Let's Make History\\" was written by J. Strickland. Track listing Reception The back of the original LP album cover contains an intro to Jones by his wife: Allmusic's Chris Woodstra writes: The album went somewhat unnoticed by country listeners.

Design and development The Beagle B.206X prototype's public debut at the Farnborough Air Show in 1961 Basset CC.1 of the RAF Southern Communication Squadron at RAF Coltishall in 1969 The design of a twin-engined light transport began in 1960 and the prototype registered G-ARRM (designated the B.206X) first flew from Shoreham Airport, West Sussex on 15 August 1961.Jackson 1974, p.198. The prototype aircraft was a five-seat all metal low-wing monoplane powered by two Continental flat-six engines. Owned since 1990 by Brooklands Museum then loaned to the Bristol Aero Collection before eventually being restored by a team of volunteers at Shoreham Airport, it was loaned to the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum at Farnborough, Hampshire from 2011 until 2017. With the expiry of the loan agreement, it was dismantled and transported from FAST to Brooklands by road on 3 August 2017. The second prototype (registered G-ARXM and designated B.206Y) was slightly larger with a larger-span wing and seating for seven. Two aircraft (designated B.206Z) were built for evaluation by the Ministry of Aviation at Boscombe Down and an order for twenty aircraft (designated B.206R) for the Royal Air Force followed. The RAF aircraft were designated Basset CC.1 and were built at Rearsby Aerodrome, Leicestershire. Initial production was the Series 1 aircraft which were powered by 310 hp Rolls-Royce Continental GIO-470A engines, and the first aircraft (G-ASMK) first flew on 17 July 1964. This aircraft was then converted as the first Series 2 aircraft with 340 hp Continental GTSIO-520C turbocharged engines and first flew as such on 23 June 1965. The production Series 2 (initially known as the B.206S) was also fitted with a large freight door. The aircraft was soon in demand with air taxi companies and as a light transport for companies. Three aircraft were delivered to the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia.Jackson 1974, p.199. A Series 3 was developed with a raised rear fuselage to carry 10-passengers but only two were flown as such, one modified from a Series 2 airframe (G-35-28 c/n B.074) was used as the \\"Aerodynamic Test Vehicle\\" and later re- converted back to a Series 2 as G-AXPVWenham 2015, p.182 and the second (G-AWLN, c/n B.080) which was converted on the production line and ultimately sold in Brazil;Wenham 2015, pp.182-183 a third airframe (B.037, which had been damaged in production) was converted as a mock-up only and never flown.Wenham 2015, p.181 When the company needed the room at Rearsby to build the Beagle Pup, production of the B.206 ended with the 79th aircraft, (c/n B.080). Four further fuselages and a number of fuselage sections had also been constructed but were never completed.Wenham 2015, p.422 Operational history Ex RAF Basset CC.1 at Asuncion Paraguay in 1975 A competition was held at RAF Northolt in March 1963 between the B.206 and the de Havilland Devon for an aircraft to replace the Avro Anson, resulting in 20 Bassets being ordered for the RAF. The first delivery to RAF communications squadrons was made in May 1965. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce/Continental GIO-470 six cylinder horizontally-opposed engines giving it a maximum speed of 220 mph and a range of 1,645 miles. Up to eight persons could be carried. The Northolt aircraft were originally based at RAF Bovingdon near Watford, Hertfordshire with the Southern Communications Squadron until the 'SCS' moved to Northolt and became 207 Squadron on 4 February 1969. Another squadron, the Northern Communications Squadron, operated Bassets from RAF Topcliffe near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, later becoming 26 Squadron at RAF Wyton. Most aircraft were removed from RAF service on 2 May 1974 and sold for civil use. Beagle B.206 Series 2 operated by Air Kilroe on charter flights from Manchester Airport during the late 1970s. The first civil-ordered aircraft (a Series 1 registered G-ASWJ) was delivered in May 1965 to Rolls-Royce Limited at Hucknall. In 1975, Rolls-Royce retired this aircraft and donated it to RAF Halton for use by apprentices as 8449M; it is now with the Midland Air Museum at CoventryWenham 2015, p.409. An unusual use was for one of the first aircraft registered G-ATHO which was bought by Maidenhead Organ Studios Limited for transporting electronic organs. Other examples were operated by UK-based air charter firms including Air Kilroe. The type was sold to and operated by civilian firms and individuals in several countries including Australia, Brazil and the United States. Bassets were sold after RAF service to the United States and Paraguay.

Biography =Early life= Bollardi√®re was born in 1907 in Brittany, into a family with a tradition of military service, particularly in the French colonial empire: he was part of the fourth generation of his family to enlist, alongside his brother, who was killed in the Rif War after their father had moved the family to Morocco in 1916. In 1927, Jacques enrolled at the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr; he graduated in 1930 and due to insubordination, it was only with the rank of sergeant. (Saint-Cyr cadets normally graduate as commissioned officers, with the rank of sous-lieutenant). He disliked the authoritarianism he encountered at Saint- Cyr: he later considered this attitude to be key to his decision to join the French Resistance whilst many of his former classmates served Vichy France. He was quickly promoted to sous-lieutenant and to lieutenant in 1932. He joined the French Foreign Legion in February 1935 and was posted to Algeria until 1940. =Second World War= In February 1940, Bollardi√®re was assigned to the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade, and promoted to captain. He took part in the Battles of Narvik, and was back in Brest on the 13th of June. Seeing the debacle of the French armies, he crossed the Channel on a fishing boat and was among the very first to join Charles de Gaulle (the momentous rallying call that founded the Fighting French was broadcast on the 18th of that month); the Vichy regime sentenced him to death. Bollardi√®re fought in Gabon, and in Eritrea during the East African Campaign. Leading a 90-man strong party, he managed to seize and occupy an Italian fort in Massawa, taking over 300 prisoners. He was made a Compagnon de la Lib√©ration for this action. Promoted to commandant (Major) in 1941, he took part in the capture of Damascus that summer. The following year, he took part in the Battle of Bir Hakeim, and the First Battle of El Alamein. He was severely wounded by a mine. In October 1943, he volunteered for Special Forces training and was put on a parachute- training course. On 12 April 1944, Bollardi√®re was parachuted in France to take a command of the maquis in Ardennes (Maquis des Manises), under the nom de guerre \\"Prisme\\". His maquis units engaged German troops and sustained heavy casualties, but made a successful link with the advancing Allied ground forces. In September 1944, Bollardi√®re returned to England. He was then posted to the Airborne Forces and joined the \\"Red Berets\\" of the 3e R√©giment de Chasseurs Parachutistes (Parachute Light Infantry), which was part of the Special Air Service Brigade. He parachuted into Holland, subsequently making his way to Germany following their defeat in 1945. =Indochina war= Bollardi√®re was in command of a paratrooper demi-brigade at the outbreak of the First Indochina War. He took part in commando actions in Laos, Cambodia and Tonkin. He subsequently said that having initially understood the Indochina War as an action to restore legitimate French rule in the area after the Japanese occupation, he came to draw parallels between the anti- colonialist forces he was fighting against and the maquis group he led during the Second World War. =Algerian War= From October 1953, Bollardi√®re taught paratrooper strategy and tactics at the Paris √âcole de Guerre, the prestigious school for staff officers. At the outbreak of the Algerian War, in July 1956, Bollardi√®re was put in command of two brigades in the Algerian Atlas Mountains. He was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade in December, becoming the youngest general of the French army of the time. His philosophy of \\"pacification\\" was significantly different from that of the violent counterinsurgency strategy used by the bulk of French forces, instead attempting to built relationships between the Pied-Noirs and the Arab-Berber population, eschewing racial profiling of indigenous people, and initiating work projects to benefit the local community. This distinct approach was noticed by opposing forces: Mohammed Lebjaoui, a member of the National Council of the Algerian Revolution, later said that for him and other leaders in the National Liberation Front, \\"General de Bollardi√®re always represented in the fight, as an enemy, the honor of the French uniform and flag. He was the only general in the French army in Algeria who compelled and deserved our respect\\". In opposition to government policy regarding usage of torture among French units, after the escalation in the violation of human rights during the Battle of Algiers, Bollardi√®re requested to be relieved of command, and returned to France in January 1957. He was sentenced to 60 days of fortress arrest at La Courneuve for \\"bringing the army into disrepute\\" by publicly supporting L'Express editor Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber's coverage of the war. The only military officer to support him was captain Pierre Dabezies (1925‚Äì2002), a left-wing Gaullist who would later lead the 11e Choc elite troop and get close to the socialist Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement.Jean Guisnel, \\"Jacques P√¢ris de Bollardi√®re, portrait d'un g√©n√©ral en honn√™te-homme\\", pp.47-49 in Histoire secr√®te de la Ve R√©publique (dir. Roger Faligot and Jean Guisnel), La D√©couverte, 2006, 2007 Bollardi√®re was later assigned to French Equatorial Africa and Germany. He resigned from the Army after the Algiers putsch, as he was not able to obtain a command in Algeria. =Retirement and pacifist activism= Jacques de Bollardi√®re (right) on the plateau of Larzac , protesting against the extension of the military camp in the 1970s. To his left, the non-violent philosophers Jean-Marie Muller and Lanza del Vasto. After his withdrawal from active service, Bollardi√®re retired to his native Brittany, joining a naval construction firm in Lorient. After initially taking to his new work with enthusiasm, he quickly became disillusioned after witnessing the alienation of workers' labour, noting that whilst hierarchies in the army had not presented a barrier to good relationships between men of different ranks, in the industrial workplace relations between workers and management were characterised by class conflict. He was driven to study this topic, drawing on Catholic social teaching to consider how this could be remedied. However, despite attempts at reforming workplace relations, he left after two and a half years, convinced that the industrial environment was inherently dehumanising. Bollardi√®re became a pacifist after a talk by the writer Jean-Marie Muller in Lorient, on 23 October 1970. He subsequently co- founded the Movement for a Non-Violent Alternative, an organisation promoting the principles of non-violence. He was president of the association Logement et Promotion Sociale between 1968 and 1978, focusing on public housing with a particular concentration on immigrants from southern Europe and Africa. He was also involved in adult education and the Breton regionalist movement, believing that the decline of Breton culture and the area's economic underdevelopment were both linked to the centralisation of the French state. In July 1973, he was arrested by the French Navy during protests against nuclear trials in Mururoa, along with journalist Brice Lalonde, priest Jean Toulat and Jean-Marie Muller. The Council of Ministers, then headed by Georges Pompidou, removed him from the army as a disciplinary measure and gave him a pension - up to this point, he had still formally been a general, albeit not serving. The group responded to their detention by going on hunger strike: after five days, Bollardi√®re started suffering from hypertension and was moved to hospital for treatment. Following the incident he returned his Legion of Honour to the French government in protest. He was also a supporter of the successful Fight for the Larzac, which protested against the expansion of a French army camp on the Larzac plateau, a project which was cancelled by Fran√ßois Mitterrand when he was elected President of France in 1981. Jacques Paris Bollardi√®re died on 22 February 1986 at his residence Vieux-Talhou√´t and was buried in Vannes, Brittany.

It was the third \\"union station\\" or \\"union depot\\" (usage varied in the 19th century), succeeding the 1853 station, burned in mid-November 1864 when Federal forces left Atlanta for the March to the Sea, and the 1871 station. Overview The station was located over the tracks between Forsyth and Spring Streets, 3 blocks west and 1 block south of the predecessor union stations. The site is the block immediately west of Five Points MARTA station. Opening in 1930, the third Union Station served the Georgia Railroad, Atlantic Coast Line (previously the Atlanta, Birmingham and Coast Railroad), and Louisville and Nashville (previously the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway). It replaced earlier stations on the same site. Major trains and destinations: *Atlantic Coast Line -in partnership with L&N;: **The Dixie Flagler ‚Äì Chicago, via Chattanooga, TN, Nashville, TN and Evansville, IN; continuing south to Jacksonville and Miami, FL **The Dixie Flyer ‚Äì Chicago, via Chattanooga, TN, Nashville, TN and Evansville, IN; continuing south to Jacksonville and Tampa, FL; shortened in 1965 to an Atlanta to Jacksonville ACL route *Georgia Railroad: **Trains to Augusta, GA for connecting trains to Atlantic Coast Line Railroad service (e.g., Palmetto) and to Southern Railway service (Aiken- Augusta Special) *Louisville and Nashville: **The Flamingo ‚Äì Cincinnati, via Knoxville, TN; continuing south to Jacksonville, FL, via Albany **The Georgian ‚Äì Chicago, via Nashville and Evansville **The Southland - Chicago, via Cincinnati, OH, Knoxville, TN; continuing south to Macon, then branching to various points in Florida.

The term can take on several different meanings depending on the context. For example: * In various branches of mathematics, certain concepts are introduced as primitive notions (e.g., the terms \\"point\\", \\"line\\" and \\"angle\\" in geometry). As these terms are not defined in terms of other concepts, they may be refer to as \\"undefined terms\\". * A function is said to be \\"undefined\\" at points outside of its domainfor example, the real-valued function f(x)=\\\\sqrt{x} is undefined for negative x (i.e., it assigns no value to negative arguments). * In algebra, some arithmetic operations may not assign a meaning to certain values of its operands (e.g., division by zero). In which case, the expressions involving such operands are termed \\"undefined\\". Undefined terms In ancient times, geometers attempted to define every term. For example, Euclid defined a point as \\"that which has no part\\". In modern times, mathematicians recognize that attempting to define every word inevitably leads to circular definitions, and therefore leave some terms (such as \\"point\\") undefined (see primitive notion for more). This more abstract approach allows for fruitful generalizations. In topology, a topological space may be defined as a set of points endowed with certain properties, but in the general setting, the nature of these \\"points\\" is left entirely undefined. Likewise, in category theory, a category consists of \\"objects\\" and \\"arrows\\", which are again primitive, undefined terms. This allows such abstract mathematical theories to be applied to very diverse concrete situations. In arithmetic The expression 0/0 is undefined in arithmetic, as explained in division by zero (the same expression is used in calculus to represent an indeterminate form). Mathematicians have different opinions as to whether 00 should be defined to equal 1, or be left undefined; see Zero to the power of zero for details. Values for which functions are undefined The set of numbers for which a function is defined is called the domain of the function. If a number is not in the domain of a function, the function is said to be \\"undefined\\" for that number. Two common examples are \\\\textstyle f(x)=\\\\frac{1}{x}, which is undefined for x=0, and f(x)=\\\\sqrt{x}, which is undefined (in the real number system) for negative x . In trigonometry In trigonometry, the functions \\\\tan \\\\theta and \\\\sec \\\\theta are undefined for all \\\\theta = 180^\\\\circ(n - \\\\frac{1}{2}), while the functions \\\\cot \\\\theta and \\\\csc \\\\theta are undefined for all \\\\theta = 180^\\\\circ(n). In computer science =Notation using ‚Üì and ‚Üë= In computability theory, if f is a partial function on S and a is an element of S, then this is written as f(a)\\\\downarrow, and is read as \\"f(a) is defined.\\" If a is not in the domain of f, then this is written as f(a)\\\\uparrow, and is read as \\" f(a) is undefined\\". The symbols of infinity In analysis, measure theory and other mathematical disciplines, the symbol \\\\infty is frequently used to denote an infinite pseudo-number, along with its negative, -\\\\infty. The symbol has no well-defined meaning by itself, but an expression like \\\\left\\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty is shorthand for a divergent sequence, which at some point is eventually larger than any given real number. Performing standard arithmetic operations with the symbols \\\\pm\\\\infty is undefined. Some extensions, though, define the following conventions of addition and multiplication: * x+\\\\infty=\\\\infty \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}. * -\\\\infty+x=-\\\\infty \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{-\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}. * x\\\\cdot\\\\infty=\\\\infty \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{+}. No sensible extension of addition and multiplication with \\\\infty exists in the following cases: * \\\\infty-\\\\infty * 0\\\\cdot\\\\infty (although in measure theory, this is often defined as 0) * \\\\frac{\\\\infty}{\\\\infty} For more detail, see extended real number line. Singularities in complex analysis In complex analysis, a point z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} where a holomorphic function is undefined is called a singularity. One distinguishes between removable singularities (i.e., the function can be extended holomorphically to z), poles (i.e., the function can be extended meromorphically to z), and essential singularities (i.e., no meromorphic extension to z can exist).

It runs entirely within the city of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. It marks the boundary between the Bridgeport and McKinley Park community areas of the city. The creek derives its name from the gases bubbling out of the riverbed from the decomposition of blood and entrails dumped into the river in the early 20th century by the local meatpacking businesses surrounding the Union Stock Yards directly south of the creek's endpoint at Pershing Road. It was brought to notoriety by Upton Sinclair in his expos√© on the American meat packing industry titled The Jungle. Bubbly Creek originates near 38th Street, at the Racine Avenue Pump Station of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. It flows in a generally northward direction for approximately , and joins with the South Branch of the Chicago River. History A man standing on slaughterhouse-derived waste in Bubbly Creek in Chicago in 1911. The area surrounding Bubbly Creek was originally a wetland; during the 19th century, channels were dredged to increase the rate of flow into the Chicago River and dry out the area to increase the amount of habitable land in the fast-growing city. The South Fork became an open sewer for the local stockyards, especially the Union Stock Yards. Meatpackers dumped waste, such as blood and entrails, into the nearest river.Grossman, James R., Ann Durkin Keating and Janice L. Ruff (eds.), Encyclopedia of Chicago, \\"Meatpacking\\", pp. 515-7, University of Chicago Press, 2004, The creek received so much blood and offal that it began to bubble methane and hydrogen sulfide gas from the products of decomposition. In 1906, author Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, an unflattering portrait of America's meat packing industry. In it, he reported on the state of Bubbly Creek, writing that: Present situation Bubbly Creek and Bridgeport Village Two heavily polluted streams that joined to create the South Fork were later filled in, but their courses can still be seen today in the configuration of streets and railroad tracks in the area. The area has been increasingly occupied by residential development such as Bridgeport Village; a program to oxygenate the creek by continuously injecting compressed air into the water has met with limited success; the creek's odor is much reduced. Some fish and vegetation have returned in recent decades.Gallun, Alby. Flushing out Bubbly Creek. Chicago Business. July 25, 2004. Areas near the creek have been designated for recreational uses including parks, and developers and the city agreed on a setback to allow for remediation. However, during heavy rains, millions of gallons of wastewater continue to be dumped into the stagnant creek by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. As of 2007, the City of Chicago and the Army Corps of Engineers were considering a $2.65 million feasibility study to look at restoration options, which would have implications for the remainder of the Chicago River system due to the unusual challenges of Bubbly Creek. The creek's waters are largely stagnant, having little gravitational flow; the study will look into possibilities, including a meandering stream amid a wetland, to restore an oxygenated system. The actual renovation project is expected to cost $15.4 million. In 2015, the project was stalled, due to contamination discovered in the creek's sediments. A private society has opened the Chicago Maritime Museum, a museum and memorialization of Chicago's river and maritime heritage, on 35th Street adjacent to Bubbly Creek.

It serves as an eastward continuation of Kanawauke Road (former Orange CR 106), extending from the Orange County line to U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and US 202 in Stony Point via Harriman State Park. CR 106 intersects with several county highways in Rockland County along the way. The route was only one of two in Rockland County to keep its numbering from Orange County, with the other being CR 72\\\\. CR 106 had one spur route, CR 106A, which was recently decommissioned. The route was originally designated County Highway 416 in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1930, it became the easternmost part of New York State Route 210 (NY 210), a state highway continuing westward into Orange County. In 1982, NY 210 was truncated to end in Greenwood Lake, and its former routing east of NY 17 was replaced by CR 106 in Orange and Rockland counties. CR 106 in Orange County was decommissioned on January 1, 2014, when maintenance was transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. Route description CR 106 begins here in Stony Point, and heads east providing an intersection with the Palisades Parkway. CR 106 begins at the Orange County line in Harriman State Park as a continuation of Kanawauke Road (formerly that county's CR 106). The route was only one of two county routes that have the same number in both Rockland and Orange counties; the other is CR 72. CR 106's western terminus at the Rockland/Orange County line. CR 106 proceeds east from here providing a border between Harriman State Park (to the west) and Bear Mountain State Park (to the east). It then intersects Lake Welch Parkway, a seasonal road which provides a route to Lake Welch Beach on the northern side of the lake. Then, CR 106 splits Lake Welch in two different locations on the southern side of the lake. CR 106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point. Immediately after entering Stony Point, CR 106 intersects CR 98 where CR 106 makes a left turn. CR 106 then proceeds east toward its intersection with the Palisades Parkway. This is at exit 15 and is the last residential exit northbound on the PIP, with everything north of this point being exits within Harriman and Bear Mountain. Just after its intersection with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR 106A & CR 69). Also, at this point CR 106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR 108, CR 47, and CR 33 as Central Drive. CR 106 comes to an end shortly after these intersections at US 9W and US 202 in downtown Stony Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina. History A few NY 210 shields still stand in Rockland County on side roads approaching CR 106\\\\. CR 106 originated in 1824, when the road was chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at a fork in the road. At the fork, part of the road became NY 210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway 416\\\\. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY 17A. The responsibility for maintaining NY 210 was turned over to the county in 1982. The road was replaced with CR 106. CR 106, which was both in Orange and Rockland counties, had its Orange County segment decommissioned on January 1, 2014 when they traded maintenance to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.  CR 106A  CR 106A was a spur which began at CR 106 and ended at a dead end near CR 69 in Stony Point.

Others who settled in the interior are: Janawuri, Salem (Babgye), Tagombali Dutse, Tangshi, Guri, Guri Kasuwa, Dingle, Kwabak, and Ubgo (Dingle Dutse) who speak the Bali language. Presently, Bali people are found in Demsa, Numan, Mayo Belwa Local Government areas of Adamawa State and Lau Local Government area of Taraba State. Majority of the people are agriculturalist, though there are traders, herders and civil servants among them. History Like any other ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Bali claims that they entered the Nigeria region from the east. The Bali, for example claim that they entered the Nigerian region from the Republic of Congo and through gradual process; they came and settled in their present geographical location. The Kpasham and Bomni denied any knowledge of distance movement. They claim that they came from Bachama land, probably from Lamurde to the area they are now occupying. The evidence points to Republic of Congo as their original homeland. It is not known when the people left their original settlement. Probably, the people must have left their original settlement in the 17th century by which time there was population movement in the whole of the West, East and Central Africa as a result of famine, fracidal wars and chieftaincy tussle. The Bali might have formed part of the population that migrated to the Lake Chad basin area and, later to the Upper Benue Valley. Before the declaration of the Jihad in Fombina, in 1809, Bali had already settled in their various communities and has developed village governments or better still, community governments, independent of each other. Apart from these community governments set up by the Bali, the people also had a well-defined social and economic system which rendered their societies stable. For example, one aspect of the social life of the people is that the Bali had great respect for life. In fact, the spilling of human blood was seen as offensive to Kpan Biswi (Kpan Luh or Luwe, among the Yotti and Kpasham respectively). Most Bali believed that it was Kpan Biswi that guide and sustain their livelihood. To the Bali, therefore, life was very sacred. The birth of a child was greeted with joy not only by the parents but also by the community as a whole. The growth and development of such a child was watched carefully by the entire community. He was trained not only by his parents and relatives alone but by the community as a whole. This made Bali child useful member of his society. Similarly, the death of a member was mourned by all and was seen as a great loss to the entire Bali Community. In short, there was social cohesion among the Bali people before the advert of Colonialism. For instance, an attack on any of the Bali Village by the enemy was seen as an attack on all. Besides, individual farmers or other hunters assisted their colleagues in time of need, especially through communal work (Gaya in Hausa). To put it in another way, during pre-colonial period, Bali Society was quite peaceful and people were hardworking. Their quarrels were settled among them peacefully, although on rare occasions, they resort to skirmishes. During the first decade of the 19th century, Bali Land started to experience some political, economic and social disequilibrium. The declaration of the Jihad in Fombina in 1809 by, Modibbo Adama affected not only the Bali but the whole of the Upper Benue Region. The Jihadists attempted to overrun the whole of Bali land but without success. However, one devastating impact of this Jihad on the people is that there were population movements throughout Bali land. In the process, many of the Bali lost their children, their relatives, friends and possessions to the Jihadists. Even before the declaration of the Jihad by Moddibo Lawan on Bali people, Baliland had been under constant threats from Fulani and Bachama slave raiders. The threats posed to the Bali by the slave raiders and the menace of the Jihadists, led to restriction of Bali social, economic and political activities. Consequently, poverty gradually started to gain inroad into the society. A missionary, Ernest Engskor who visited Bali village in the early 1930S had this to bay: Bali appeared to us to be one of the most wretched, primitive and poverty stricken of African villages, enslaved as the people were by ancient tradition and fear of evil spirit. Our had been on exceptional and unique experience for it was almost as though these people had awakened from their sleeping beauty enhancement to discover the great world beyond their isolated society (Enskor, 1983:179). The Bali was gradually tackling the problems of slave raiders and Fulbe Jihadists, when British colonial masters extended their activities to Bali land. Eventually the people were conquered and brought under the British colonial administration in 1903. In 1903 to 1912, the whole area South of Numan Town was regarded as ‚Äúclosed territory‚Äù. It was not until after 1912 that Bali land, including those living in Mayo-Belwa and Lau was opened to Christian missionaries. By the 1940s, colonialism and Christianity were deeply noted in Bali villages. Indeed, while the Christian missions, especially the United Sudan Mission (SUM) were busy softening the minds of the people they saw as ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù, the British Colonial Masters were taking their resources away for the development of their home countries. The result is that Bali was left to face acute starvation and hunger. In this[1] way, colonialism continued to destroy Bali economy, technology and self-reliant development just as the slave raiders and Jihadists had done. This was how the whole of Baliland became a British possession at the beginning of the 20th century like any other ethnic nationality in Nigeria. Indeed, slave trade and colonialism were the major forces that set back Bali development. The slave raiders dominated Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali resources. Throughout colonial period, the Bali struggled to free themselves from colonial domination. In 1913, for example, one of the Bali men short and wounded a British Touring Officer who had gone to Bali for head account. In reprisal, Bali village was attacked and destroyed by the British punitive expedition. It took the people years to build their village. But this did not stop the people from opposing the British actively or passively. On 1 October 1960, however, the Bali people together with the rest of the ethnic groups in the country gained political independence from Britain.

Unusually, it is not directly toxic to fungi but works by inducing systemic acquired resistance, the natural defence system of plants. History In the 1980s, researchers at Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland were seeking novel fungicides. They discovered that the methyl ester of 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid, and many other derivatives, had useful activity on fungal diseases, for example Pyricularia oryzae on rice. In subsequent studies it was shown that the compound responsible for the biological activity was the carboxylic acid itself but that for optimum activity when used commercially it was important to choose a derivative which met requirements of product safety, ease of application and appropriate physical properties for translocation in the crop. After many derivatives of the acid had been tested, the S-methyl thioester was chosen for development under the code name CGA245704. The product was launched in 1996 and is now sold by Syngenta with brand names including Bion and Actigard. Synthesis The first synthesis of the parent 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid was disclosed in patents filed by Ciba-Geigy. The heterocyclic ring of the 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole core is formed by the classic ring-closure of a thiol onto a diazonium group adjacent in its benzene ring. One example from the patent is the diazotisation reaction of 3-amino-2-benzylthiobenzoic acid methyl ester, as its hydrochloride salt, with sodium nitrite in water. This gives 7-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3-benzothiadiazole in 86% yield after recrystallization. :500px Conversion of the ester into the thioester is by standard hydrolysis to form the free carboxylic acid followed by conversion of the acid to the S-methyl thioester as standard chemical transformations. Mechanism of action Acibenzolar-S-methyl has an unusual mechanism of action for a fungicide. It is not directly toxic to the fungus but instead activates the natural defences of the crop in a manner similar to the known role of salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate. The genes for systemic acquired resistance are induced and pathogenesis-related proteins are produced. The thioester is a propesticide for its active carboxylic acid metabolite. This hydrolysis reaction occurs in the plant, catalyzed by methyl salicylate esterase. Usage =In the USA= Pesticides are required to seek registration from appropriate authorities in the country in which they will be used. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). A pesticide can only be used legally according to the directions on the label that is included at the time of the sale of the pesticide. The purpose of the label is \\"to provide clear directions for effective product performance while minimizing risks to human health and the environment\\". A label is a legally binding document that mandates how the pesticide can and must be used and failure to follow the label as written when using the pesticide is a federal offence. Acibenzolar-S-methyl is registered in the USA for use either as a seed treatment or for direct spraying on crops. Since it activates the crop's own defence mechanisms, it is not usually effective in curing established disease, only in protecting against future disease development. As a seed treatment it is registered for use on cotton, sunflower and sorghum while for spraying it is licensed on a wide range of vegetable crops. The estimated annual use of acibenzolar-S-methyl in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Survey and shows a growing trend from its introduction in 2000 to 2017, the latest date for which figures are available. However, the total annual use has never exceeded 8000 lb (3600 kg), which is very low for an agrochemical. As expected given the main use on fruit and vegetables, the main areas of use are in California and Florida. =In Europe= The product is also registered in Europe, where there is a monitoring programme to make sure that residues in food are below the limits set by the European Food Safety Authority. It is sometimes mixed with other pesticides to provide an extra degree of control by activating the crop's defence mechanisms in addition to the lethal effect of the main ingredient. Human safety Acibenzolar-S-methyl has little toxicity to mammals with an LD50 of over 2000 mg/kg (rats, oral). However, it can cause moderate eye irritation. First aid information is included with the label. The Codex Alimentarius database maintained by the FAO lists the maximum residue limits for acibenzolar-S-methyl and its parent acid in various food products. Resistance management Although fungal populations have the ability to develop resistance to fungicides, the mechanism of action of acibenzolar-S- methyl gives it an advantage over conventional pesticides owing to its lack of direct toxicity to fungi. Nevertheless, regulatory bodies such as the EPA and the Fungicides Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) monitor the risks of resistance developing: FRAC has assigned acibenzolar-S-methyl into its own class (group P01 fungicide).

It took part in the Burma Campaign. History Men of the 81st West African Division mingle with Indian soldiers after their arrival in India for jungle training. The inspiration for the division's formation came from General George Giffard, commander of the British Army's West Africa Command, who subsequently commanded India Command's Eastern Army, facing the Japanese army on the frontier between India and Burma. Giffard had wide experience with African troops, and was eager for them to participate in the war. The framework around which the division was formed was the Royal West African Frontier Force. One of the brigades (the 3rd West African) and several of the supporting units which formed the division had already seen action with the 11th (African) Division, against the Italians in East Africa. The division was established as the 1st (West African) Division on 1 March 1943. Three days later it was renamed the 81st (West African) Division, taking the next vacant number in the list of British infantry divisions. The division's badge was a spider, in black on a yellow circular background. This spider was a reference to Ananse, a cunning character in Ashanti mythology, and drawn so that when a soldier raised his weapon to fire, the spider would appear to be going forwards. Doctors operating on some of the 81st Division's casualties in Burma, August 1944 The division arrived in India on 14 August 1943. The movement of the 5th (West African) Brigade was delayed, however, after the troopship which was to carry it was lost in the German attack on Convoy Faith off Portugal on the night of 11/12 July 1943. The 3rd (West African) Brigade was detached to the Chindits, and was intended to garrison jungle bases for the raiding columns. The remainder of the division took part in the second Arakan campaign from February to May, 1944, operating in the Kaladan Valley on the flank of Indian XV Corps. In late March, substantial Japanese reinforcements (with some troops from the Indian National Army) outflanked the division and forced it to retreat over a range of hills out of the Kaladan valley into that of the Kalapanzin. In August, the division re-entered the Kaladan valley, forcing the Japanese and Indian National Army to abandon Mowdok, a few miles east of the Indian / Burmese frontier. The division then advanced down the valley once again, reaching Myohaung near the mouth of the river on 28 January 1945. The division was withdrawn to India to rest on 22 April 1945. On 31 August, it was returned to West Africa and disbanded. Character and organisation The division was originally intended to operate on a pack basis, with porters carrying all equipment and supplies. Lieutenant General William Slim, then commanding XV Corps, commented on first inspecting units of the division in late 1943: > Their discipline and smartness were impressive, and they were more obviously > at home in the jungle than any troops I had yet seen... I was at once struck > by two things. First, by the horde of unarmed porters who were needed to > carry supplies, ammunition, baggage and the heavier weapons, and secondly by > the large number of white men in a unit, fifty or sixty to a battalion. > Accustomed as I was to Indian battalions in the field with usually only > seven or eight Europeans, it struck me as an unnecessarily generous > supply.Defeat into Victory, William Slim, Cassell, 1956 Order of Battle General Officer Commanding : Major General Frederick Joseph Loftus-Tottenham (as of 1 February 1944): =5th (West African) Infantry Brigade= * 5th Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment * 7th Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment * 8th Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment * 5th Light Battery, West African Artillery * 3rd Field Company, West African Engineers =6th (West African) Infantry Brigade= * 1st Battalion, Gambia Regiment * 1st Battalion, Sierra Leone Regiment * 4th Battalion, Nigeria Regiment * 3rd Light Battery, West African Artillery * 6th Field Company West African Engineers =Divisional Units= * 11th (East African) Division Scouts * 81st (West African) Infantry Division Transport Regiment * 1st Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti- Tank Regiment, West African Artillery * 8th Field Park Company West African Engineers * 81st (West African) Divisional Signals =3rd (West African) Infantry Brigade= Detached to Special Force: * 6th Battalion, Nigeria Regiment * 7th Battalion, Nigeria Regiment * 12th Battalion, Nigeria Regiment See also *Military history of Nigeria during World War II *The Gambia in World War II *82nd (West African) Division *Seth Anthony, first non-European from Africa to gain the King's Commission References Bibliography * External links * * Burma Star organisation page * British Military History Category:British World War II divisions Category:Infantry divisions of the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations of the British Empire in World War II D Category:Military history of the Gambia Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ","title":"81st (West Africa) Division"},{"id":"9921237","text":"Camille Cazedessus II (born December 8, 1938), also known as \\"Caz\\", is an American editor and publisher.

Baker Elementary School., accessed November 15, 2009 Lakeville School offers its students English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, Special Area Programs, Intervention Programs, and Enrichment Courses. Academics =English Language Arts= Language arts are language skills, such as reading, writing, listening, speaking for information, understanding, literary response, critical analysis, and social interaction---are central to the total elementary curriculum. Great Neck Public Schools Web site, PDF document titled \\"Great Neck Public Schools...at a Glance\\", accessed November 15, 2009 In the primary grades (first through second), the focus is on developing literacy skills integrated with the study of social studies, science, mathematics, and technology. Language arts are also stressed in the intermediate grades (third through fifth). Reading becomes more refined and writing is integrated into all curriculum areas through the use of expository essays, research reports, literature responses, journals, and logs. =Mathematics= Interdisciplinary applications in mathematics include the use of children's literature, written communication to express mathematical thinking and problem solving, and appropriate computer software. Children learn how to interpret graphs and charts, collect and analyze data, and draw conclusions. =Social Studies= The social studies curriculum includes geography, history, map studies, economics, civics, citizenship, and government. It begins in the primary grades with themes that concentrate on the family, school, and community, and expands in the intermediate grades to include Long Island, New York State, the United States, and selected world communities, all of which are explored culturally, politically, geographically, and historically. =Special Area Programs= Specialists work with children and classroom teachers to enhance and enrich the elementary program in science, reading, gifted, computer, art, music, physical education, technology, and library/media. Science Consultants work directly with students in a laboratory setting to provide scheduled \\"hands-on\\" science experiences, focusing on the development of inquiry and problem- solving skills. The classroom teachers reinforce and expand knowledge of this content area in their ongoing programs. Reading Resource Teachers work with students, classroom teachers, and administrators to help ensure each child's progress in reading. Teachers of the Gifted work with third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children whose needs cannot be entirely met in the regular classroom. Special projects and advanced studies, as well as independent research, are developed to meet these children's needs and interests. In addition, teachers of the gifted serve as consultants and provide additional resources to the classroom teachers in grades K-5. Computer Teachers implement a sequential curriculum in computer skills and technology applications for students in grades K-5. Staff developers provide classroom teachers with training to support the integration of technology with classroom instruction. Lakeville School is equipped with a Computer Instructional Center and either an additional lab or a wireless laptop cart for whole-class computer activities. In addition, to enhance and support instruction in all subject areas, grades 1-5 classrooms are equipped with four computers and laptop; kindergarten classrooms have three computers. Art, Music, Physical Education, and Technology Specialists support the elementary program and expand the children's horizons for lifelong learning. They work with all classes, beginning in kindergarten. A spiraling curriculum in each of these areas addresses skills, creative expression, and aesthetic appreciation. Library/Media Specialists teach elementary children to become effective users of information. They encourage the cultivation of literature apprection, and support and enrich the educational program. Children are taught research skills and learn to access information from a variety of print and technology sources, such as reference CDs and multimedia encyclopedias. The library/media specialists meet with classroom teachers to plan mutually supportive activities and projects. =Intervention Programs= A team of teachers provides intervention services for children with special needs, working with them individually and in small groups. There is close articulation between the teachers who provide academic intervention and the classroom teachers. Speech Teachers work with small groups of identified children to develop their oral communication skills. Math Lab Teachers provide additional support for children having difficulty with computation or problem-solving, to help ensure their success in the classroom. Reading Teachers meet with small groups of children in grades 1-5, to reinforce the development of their reading and writing skills. This supplements the reading program provided in the classroom. Reading Recovery Teachers meet with individual, at-risk first- graders, five times a week, for approximately 20 weeks, to provide intensive early intervention. Children are taught strategies for decoding and comprehension, as well as techniques for becoming independent readers. ESL (English as a Second Language) Teachers work with children of limited English proficiency to develop their language skills. These teachers also serve as consultants to the classroom teachers. =Enrichment Courses= Classroom and special-area teachers offer enrichment courses before and after school for children who elect additional studies and challenges. Areas covered include advanced computer programming, drama, foreign language, language development, literature, and math and science investigation. =Homework Center= Homework Center provide an after-school program for children in the intermediate grades. Certified teachers, teacher assistants, and volunteers assist students with homework or special projects assigned by their classroom teachers. =Tutoring= Small-group tutoring is also provided before and after school for students in the intermediate grades who are at risk with regard to the New York State Assessments in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. =Paraprofessionals= Teaching Assistants (instructional paraprofessionals) help in the library, computer, and instructional programs. Non-instructional Paraprofessionals provide supervision and ensure the welfare and safety of children before school and during their lunch and recess periods. Special education Lakeville School is a comprehensive elementary school. Therefore, it is required to meet the needs of students who are at risk of failing academically. These programs listed below are designed for them. Some students who are at-risk may be asked to leave Lakeville School to attend a special education school, special class operated by another school district or other in-district special education program.Services; URL accessed November 15, 2009.

He played college football at the University of New Mexico. College career A stellar three-sport athlete in high school in Tempe, Ariz., Dennard exploded onto the college scene at the University of New Mexico in 1974. He had been recruited out of Marcos de Niza high school. He became the first Lobo freshman to garner first team All-WAC honors. In 1975, he beat out a Freshman receiver from Arizona State named John Washington, who would later change his last name to his father's name. John Jefferson. Dennard finished third in the nation in receiving. He was first team all-league in 1976. By his senior year, Dennard held every receiving record at UNM. He caught 142 passes for 2,257 yards, numbers that still rank high in the Lobo record book. 1974 was the first year that Dennard saw game action. That season he caught 15 passes for 171 yards as New Mexico finished 4-6-1 under head coach Bill Mondt. The following season, the team improved to 6-5 and the inconsistency at quarterback had been resolved. Dennard had his best season, stats wise, as he hauled in 59 passes for 962 yards and 6 touchdowns.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/players/preston-dennard-1.html while Dennard emerged on the field, New Mexico struggled to win, losing seven games in both Dennard's junior and senior years. Professional career Dennard then spent nine seasons in the NFL, playing for Los Angeles, Buffalo and Green Bay. His career numbers were 232 receptions for 3,665 yards and 30 TDs. He was a starter for the Rams in the 1980 Super Bowl and was twice nominated for the NFL Man of the Year award. Dennard made the Rams as undrafted free agent in 1978. Appearing mostly as a special teams player, Dennard did catch three passes for 35 yards for a Rams team that finished 12-4, but was crushed 28-0 in the conference championship by the Dallas Cowboys. Dennard started 11 games in 1979, playing alongside Willie Miller and Billy Waddy. That season Dennard caught 32 passes for 766 yards and four touchdowns. He played in the play offs, and caught two passes for 32 yards in the Super Bowl loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. It would be the only time that Dennard played in the Super Bowl. Dennard was emerging as a favorite target for Rams quarterback Vince Ferragamo during this time. One of the most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 season, when Ferragamo found Dennard for a 34-yard touchdown strike to put the Rams up 28-0 over the Cowboys a game the Rams would go on to win 38-14.https://www.pro- football-reference.com/boxscores/198012150ram.htm However, the Cowboys got the last laugh when they beat the Rams weeks later in a wild card game, 34-13.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198012280dal.htm The Rams fortunes changed when Ferragamo bulked at signing a new contract and bolted for the Canadian Football League. The Rams turned to Pat Haden and ex- raiders cast off Dan Pastorini at quarterback, the Rams fell to 6-10. Despite the uncertainty at quarterback, Dennard still posted impressive numbers, catching 49 passes for 821 yards and four touchdowns. The 1982 season, marred by a players strik, was aforgettable one as the Rams fell to 2-7. Dennard rebounded the next season under new head coach John Robinson. Even Vince Ferragamo had returned from his exodus up north, and the Rams returned to the NFC championship. However, dreams of a return to the Super Bowl were crushed when they were steamrolled by the Washington Redskins 51-7, with Dennard accounting from the rams only score. It would serve to be Dennard's last meaningful game in a Rams uniform. Shortly before the 1984 season was to begin, the Rams traded Dennard to the Buffalo Bills for a safety named Chris Williams.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/03/sports/sports-people-bills-get- dennard.html The Bills were on tough times, with quarterback Joe Ferguson in the twilight of his career, and a couple of unheralded back ups named Joe Dufek and Matt Kofler behind him. The Bills stumbled to an 0-11 record before they upset the Dallas Cowboys 14-3. Dennard did not catch a pass that game, but finished the season with 7 touch down receptions. The next season, Dennard signed with the Green Bay Packers. Alongside receivers James Lofton and Phillip Epps], Dennard was mostly a third receiver, but still managed to haul in 13 passes for 182 yards and two touchdowns. He caught one touchdown pass from Jim Zorn in the Packers 38/14 win over the New Orleans Saints,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/03/sports/sports-people-bills-get- dennard.html and the final touchdown pass of his career, again from Zorn, in the Packers 34-24 loss to the Miami Dolphins.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/198512080gnb.htm Personal life After football, Dennard engaged in private enterprises. He attended and graduated from the Columbia School of Broadcasting and managed his own public speaking career. He coached at Cal State Fullerton and UNM for a short time, then went to work as a broadcaster. Dennard has volunteered for countless charities and served on a variety of Board of Directors. He is known throughout the Albuquerque community not only for his sports celebrity but also for his generous contributions to youth leadership programs, sports camps and clinics, celebrity tournaments and drug prevention. In 2018, the Rams honored their past by honoring Deannrd during a day of legends before a preseason game against the Oakland Raiders.https://www.abqjournal.com/1276641/going-back-in- time-preston-dennard-recalls-super-bowl-xiv.html http://www.golobos.com/news/2011/8/18/209071419.aspx References Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:New Mexico Lobos football players Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People from Cordele, Georgia ","title":"Preston Dennard"},{"id":"9921313","text":"Monadnock Regional High School is a public school in Swanzey, New Hampshire.

It has elements of social comedy but fell foul of radical critics who advocated the need of more overt reform. Plot The story revolves around Elena Stakhova, a girl with a hypochondriac mother and an idle father, a retired guards lieutenant with a mistress. On the eve of the Crimean War, Elena is pursued by a free-spirited sculptor (Pavel Shubin) and a serious-minded student (Andrei Berzyenev). But when Berzyenev's revolutionary Bulgarian friend, Dmitri Insarov, meets Elena, they fall in love. In secretly marrying Insarov Elena disappoints her mother and enrages her father, who had hoped to marry her to a dull, self-satisfied functionary, Kurnatovski. Insarov nearly dies from pneumonia and only partly recovers. On the outbreak of war Insarov tries to return with Elena to Bulgaria, but dies in Venice. Elena takes Insarov's body to the Balkans for burial and then vanishes. Development and reception Turgenev had long meditated On the Eve, wishing to represent a new type of idealistic but self-sacrificing heroine whom he eventually embodied in Elena. Following its long gestation, the book was written in a few months and first appeared in 1859 in the Moscow magazine The Russian Messenger, where it aroused interest but not universal approval. Turgenev himself had misgivings about On the Eve and these were strengthened by the adverse reaction of Countess Lambert, to whom he had promised to dedicate the novel. He was on the point of burning the manuscript until a friend dissuaded him.Hisham Matar, ‚ÄúRereading: On the Eve by Ivan Turgenev‚Äù, The Guardian, 30 Dec 2011 The novel‚Äôs structural weakness is noted by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which describes it as ‚Äúan episodic work, further weakened by the shallow portrayal of its Bulgarian hero‚Äù.Richard H. Freeborn, ‚ÄúIvan Turgenev‚Äù A key contributing circumstance was that the central plot was not of Turgenev‚Äôs invention. It derived from a notebook given him by Vassili Karatyeev before leaving for service in the Crimean War, from which the young recruit was not to return. Looking through its pages, Turgenev later recorded, ‚ÄúI found roughly sketched out what afterwards formed the subject of On the Eve, though the story was not completed and broke off abruptly. Karatyeev while in Moscow had become enamoured of a young woman who at first returned his love; later, however, she got to know a Bulgarian, fell in love with him and went away with him to Bulgaria, where he soon died. The story of this love was sincerely but clumsily recorded in the notebook - Karatyeev, indeed, was not born a writer. Only one scene, namely the journey to Tsaritsino, was depicted fairly vividly and I retained its main features.‚ÄùGilbert Gardiner, the introduction and appendix to his translation (1950) According to Edward Garnett in his introduction to the first English translation (1895),University of Adelaide ebook, 2014 this reliance on a plot element based on the experience of another hindered Turgenev from characterising his hero successfully.

For instance, if a function takes two pointers \`A\` and \`B\` which have the same value, then the name \`A[0]\` aliases the name \`B[0]\`. In this case we say the pointers \`A\` and \`B\` alias each other. Note that the concept of pointer aliasing is not very well-defined ‚Äì two pointers \`A\` and \`B\` may or may not alias each other, depending on what operations are performed in the function using \`A\` and \`B\`. Aliasing and re-ordering Aliasing introduces strong constraints on program execution order. If two write accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they must occur in sequence in the final machine code. Re- ordering the accesses will produce an incorrect program result (in the general case). The same is true for a write access and a read access. However, if two read accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they need not occur in the same sequence in the machine code - aliasing read accesses are safe to re-order. This is because the underlying data is not changed by the read operation, so the same value is always read. It is vitally important that a compiler can detect which accesses may alias each other, so that re-ordering optimizations can be performed correctly. Several strategies are possible: In C or C++, as mandated by the strict aliasing rule, pointer arguments in a function are assumed not to alias if they point to fundamentally different types, except for \`char*\` and \`void*\`, which may alias to any other type. Some compilers allow the strict aliasing rule to be turned off, so that any pointer argument may alias any other pointer arguments. In this case, the compiler must assume that any accesses through these pointers can alias. This can prevent some optimizations. In C99, the \`restrict\` keyword was added, which specifies that a pointer argument does not alias any other pointer argument. In Fortran, procedure arguments and other variables may not alias each other (unless they are pointers or have the target attribute), and the compiler assumes they do not. This enables excellent optimization, and is one major reason for Fortran's reputation as a fast language. (Note that aliasing may still occur within a Fortran function. For instance, if \`A\` is an array and \`i\` and \`j\` are indices which happen to have the same value, then \`A[i]\` and \`A[j]\` are two different names for the same memory location. Fortunately, since the base array must have the same name, index analysis can be done to determine cases where \`A[i]\` and \`A[j]\` cannot alias.) In pure functional languages, function arguments may usually alias each other, but all pointers are read-only. Thus, no alias analysis needs to be done. Aliasing and multi- threading If multiple threads have names which alias the same memory location, two problems arise. First, unless the memory location is protected in some way, then read-modify-write operations which are non-atomic might be interleaved with similar operations on another thread, producing incorrect results. In this case, some form of synchronization primitive must be used (e.g. a critical section). Second, even with synchronization, if two aliasing accesses occur in different threads in a non-ordered way, the program behaviour may become non-deterministic - different runs of the same program on the same data may produce different results. Thus, it is often important to impose an explicit ordering between threads which have aliases. Notes External links * How to trick C/C++ compilers into generating terrible code?

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals, Texas Rangers, and Cincinnati Reds, and in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. High school and college career Ohlendorf was born in Austin, Texas. His family owns a Texas Longhorn ranch that Ohlendorf helps maintain. He graduated from St. Stephen's Episcopal High School in Austin in 2001 where he was a two-sport athlete, playing basketball and baseball.St. Stephen's Episcopal School: Athletics Ohlendorf attended Princeton University, where he majored in Operations Research and Financial Engineering. He also played college baseball for the Princeton Tigers baseball team. In 2002, as a freshman pitcher, he was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Ohlendorf, a second-team All-Ivy selection, was 3rd in the League with a 3.02 ERA. He finished with a 6‚Äì2 record.All-Ivy Baseball Announced In 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. As a student, he penned a 140-page senior thesis entitled Investing in Prospects: A Look at the Financial Successes of Major League Baseball Rule IV Drafts from 1989 to 1993 http://libweb5.princeton.edu/theses/index.htm Ohlendorf completed his degree at Princeton in 2006 while in the Arizona Diamondbacks' farm system. He received the George Mueller Award from the university for combining \\"high scholarly achievement in the study of engineering with quality performance in intercollegiate athletics\\". In his senior thesis, Ohlendorf used sabermetrics to demonstrate the return on investment from the Major League Baseball Draft. Professional career =Arizona Diamondbacks= Ohlendorf was selected in the fourth round of 2004 Major League Baseball Draft by the Diamondbacks. In 2004, Ohlendorf was chosen by Baseball America as one of the Northwest League's Top 20 prospects. In 2005, he was named to the Midwest League All- Star team. He finished the season tied for the team lead with 11 victories, and second in the league with 144 strikeouts. In 2006, playing for the Diamondbacks AA affiliate, the Tennessee Smokies, Ohlendorf went 10‚Äì8 with a 3.29 ERA and led the Southern League with four complete games, earning a promotion to AAA Tucson for one playoff start.From St. Stephen's to New York Yankees camp New York Yankees in 2008 spring training =New York Yankees= He was traded to the New York Yankees as the key prospect in the Randy Johnson deal.Yankees Weigh the Other Half of a Blockbuster Trade Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said of Ohlendorf: \\"He's big, physical, eats innings and he's competitive. He's a workhorse.\\"Yanks prospect throws the ball low and hard Ohlendorf pitched mostly for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in 2007. Ohlendorf struggled with injuries and inconsistency as a starter with Scranton and was moved to the bullpen. Ohlendorf embraced his new role and pitched extremely effectively, able to maintain a higher velocity and precision on his pitches due to shorter outings. On September 9, when Scranton was eliminated from the playoffs, Ohlendorf was promoted to the Major Leagues. On September 11, he pitched in his first Major League game against the Toronto Blue Jays for the Yankees. He pitched one inning without allowing a baserunner while striking out one. On September 15, he pitched 1 innings against the Boston Red Sox, allowing a walk and a home run, but recording all four outs on strikeouts. Ohlendorf impressed the Yankees enough in September to earn a spot on the ALDS roster, but struggled in his lone appearance in the series, allowing three runs on four hits and one walk in one inning. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On July 26, 2008, Ohlendorf was acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the New York Yankees in a deal with Jos√© T√°bata, Jeff Karstens, and Daniel McCutchen for Xavier Nady and D√°maso Marte. Ohlendorf spent the first month pitching for the AAA Indianapolis Indians and was called up to Pittsburgh on September 2 when the rosters expanded. He was added to the starting rotation and made his first appearance on September 3 against the Cincinnati Reds where he pitched 6 innings and allowed 3 earned runs in a 6‚Äì5 Pirates victory. When Ohlendorf faced Will Venable who batted leadoff on September 28, 2008 for San Diego, he became the first Princeton pitcher to oppose a Princeton batter. Pittsburgh Pirates in 2009 Ohlendorf would pitch his first full season in the majors for the Pirates in 2009. He would earn the status of being the only Pirates starter to have a winning record, going 11‚Äì10 out of his 29 pitched games with a 3.92 ERA. Ohlendorf was a stamina pitcher, often lasting late into games. In all, he threw 176 innings, 45 more than his previous year total. The Pirates would shut him down for the remainder of the season following his September 19 start to rest him for next year. Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington would say, \\"We're looking forward to working with him to put him in position to where he can be a 200-plus inning starter for many, many years to come.\\" On September 5, 2009, Ohlendorf became the 40th pitcher to strike out three batters on nine pitches. His final 2009 stats were an 11‚Äì10 record, a 3.92 ERA, 25 home runs given up, hit 7 batsmen, walked 53, struck out 109, had a .255 average against, a 1.23 walks and hits per inning pitched, in 176.2 innings. Ohlendorf was hit in the head by a line drive off of Troy Tulowitzki's bat in a July 28, 2010 game against the Colorado Rockies. He left the game as a precaution. This was the 2nd time in 2010 a Pirates pitcher was hit in the head by a line drive, the first being Chris Jakubauskas. Unlike Jakubauskas, Ohlendorf did not miss any starts. Following the season and a 1‚Äì11 record with a 4.07 E.R.A., Ohlendorf won his arbitration hearing and a $439,000 raise to $2,025,000. Ohlendorf only made two starts in 2011 before going on the disabled list with a shoulder strain, and after experiencing a setback in his rehab program did not make another major league start until August 23. On September 15, Ohlendorf hit his first career home run off Dana Eveland, also becoming the first Pirates pitcher to homer since Paul Maholm did so on May 9, 2009, against the New York Mets. Ohlendorf finished 2011 with a 1‚Äì3 record in 9 games with an 8.15 ERA. On December 7, 2011, Ohlendorf was released by the Pirates. =Boston Red Sox= On February 16, 2012, Ohlendorf signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was assigned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox where he compiled a 4‚Äì3 record and 4.61 ERA in 10 starts. Ohlendorf opted out of his contract of June 1, 2012, and became a free agent. =San Diego Padres= On June 4, 2012, Ohlendorf signed a 1-year deal with the San Diego Padres. He was initially used out of the bullpen, but numerous injuries to the Padres' rotation gave him an opportunity to start. He made his first major league start of the season on June 16. Ohlendorf made 9 starts in 13 total appearances for the Padres and posted a 4‚Äì4 record and a 7.58 ERA in 48 innings. He was optioned to Triple-A Tucson on August 18 after lasting only 13 total innings in his last four starts with a 14.54 ERA. The Padres designated Ohlendorf for assignment on September 4 and he became a free agent after the season. =Washington Nationals= Ohlendorf with the Nationals On January 10, 2013, Ohlendorf signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. On July 26, 2013, he started against the New York Mets in the second game of a day/night double header. Ohlendorf enjoyed a successful 2013 season, recording 4 wins and a 3.28 ERA in 16 appearances. After the season, Ohlendorf signed a one-year deal to return to Washington, avoiding arbitration. On March 26, 2014, the Nationals voided Ohlendorf's deal by sending him down to AAA. Ohlendorf did not pitch in the Majors due to numerous injuries, including a back injury which limited him to appearing in just five minor league games. After the season, he became a free agent. =Texas Rangers= On January 23, 2015, Ohlendorf signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. Ohlendorf pitched seven and two thirds innings for the Rangers, striking out nine while allowing three runs in eight appearances out of the bullpen. On June 7, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained right groin. On July 27, he was designated for assignment by the Rangers. He was released on July 31. He was re-signed by the Rangers and added to the major league roster on September 1. In the 14th inning of Game 2 of the 2015 American League Division Series, Ohlendorf would pick up a save in the Rangers 6-4 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. =Kansas City Royals= On February 18, 2016, the Kansas City Royals signed Ohlendorf to a minor league contract. He opted out of his minor league contract on March 21 and became a free agent on March 23, after the Royals declined to add him to the 40-man roster. =Cincinnati Reds= Ohlendorf pitching for the Reds in 2016 Ohlendorf signed a one-year, major league contract with the Cincinnati Reds on March 26, 2016.Ross Ohlendorf lands with Cincinnati after getting cut by Royals =Tokyo Yakult Swallows= On December 23, 2016, Ohlendorf signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

Beginning in 2013, he switched to an \\"old school\\" windup where the hands are separated (the ball remains in his glove, set where he can quickly grip the ball) before coming back together. Personal life Ohlendorf's brother Chad also attended Princeton and pitched for the school. After the 2006 season, Ohlendorf became an intern for the University of Texas System's Office of Finance. Following the 2009 season, he began an eight-week internship for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 2010, Ohlendorf was chosen as the third-smartest athlete in sports by the Sporting News, behind baseball pitcher Craig Breslow and football player Myron Rolle.

Early life Fitch was born in 1937 in New Haven, Connecticut of New England parents (John E. Riley and Dorcas Tarr) and raised with two younger sisters in the Snake River Valley in Idaho. She has lived in Quincy, Massachusetts; in Pasadena, La Jolla and Los Angeles, California; and in Paris, France. Her writing career began when she was a columnist for her high school and college school papers; but it was in graduate school that she discovered the story of Sylvia Beach's bookshop on the Left Bank of Paris and decided she would tell the story of Sylvia Beach, her bookshop Shakespeare and Company (1919‚Äì1942), and the publication of James Joyce's Ulysses (the 1922 novel that would change world fiction). Since then, every book Fitch has written has some connection with Paris and the artists who lived and worked there, including her biographies of Beach, Nin, and Child. Career In June 2011, Noel Riley Fitch was awarded the prestigious Prix de la Tour Montparnasse literary award in France for her book Sylvia Beach: Une am√©ricaine √† Paris (Perrin Publishers 2011), the French translation by Elizabeth Danger of Noel's widely acclaimed 1983 book Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation. Her book Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child (1997) was written with Child's full cooperation and exclusive authorization. Publishers Weekly said the book is written \\"warmly and compellingly.\\" Kirkus Reviews called its \\"details. . .exquisite\\" and the story \\"exhaustively researched, charming.\\" Entertainment Weekly named it number five of the ten best books of the year. Following her earlier Literary Caf√©s of Paris, Fitch returned to the travel genre to author The Grand Literary Caf√©s of Europe (London, 2006; US, 2007). Covering the history of coffee and the coffeehouse, the book features nearly 40 cafes in 20 countries. Paris Caf√©: The S√©lect Crowd, co-authored with illustrator Rick Tulka, was published November 2007. Fitch appears in several documentary films, including Portrait of a Bookstore as an Old Man, Berenice Abbott: A View of the Twentieth Century (1992), Paris: The Luminous Years (PBS 2010) and the A&E; Biography of Julia Child, first shown October 14, 1997 and based on her book, Appetite for Life. Fitch earned a Ph.D. from Washington State University and has taught at Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego State University, University of Southern California, and the American University of Paris. She is presently writing the story of the Irish woman Louison O'Morphi (Marie Louise O'Murphy) mistress of Louis XV of France, model for Rococo painter Fran√ßois Boucher, and subject of a chapter in Giacomo Casanova's memoirs. Fitch recently retired from lecturing at both the University of Southern California and the American University of Paris. She and her husband live in Los Angeles, Paris, and New York City.

It is the largest stadium in Syria, and is currently used mostly for football matches. It serves as a home ground of Al-Ittihad football club. It also hosted some home games of the Syrian football team. The stadium was opened in 2007 and holds up to 53,200 spectators. The venue is located near the al-Hamadaniah Sports City in the southwestern part of Aleppo. History alt= The construction of the stadium was launched in 1980, based on the design of the Polish Constructor Stanislaw Kus with the assistance of architect Fawzi Khalifeh. It was scheduled to be completed in 1987 to become ready for the Mediterranean games. However, the construction process was stopped and delayed for 2 decades due to financial difficulties, until 2003 when the officials of the Syrian Government implemented a serious programme to overcome all difficulties. Finally, after a record period of 27 years of construction, the stadium became ready with its entire facilities in early 2007. Officially, the stadium was opened on 3 April 2007 with an inaugural friendly match between al-Ittihad and Fenerbah√ße of Turkey which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The first goal scored in the stadium came at the 8th minute of the inaugural match, through Abdul Fattah Al Agha. The Syrian president Bashar Al Assad and Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan attended the opening ceremony and the match. = Civil war = It was severely damaged during the Syrian Civil War. Its facade and many of its indoor facilities were completely destroyed, and the pitch and tribunes took significant damage, especially from mortar fire. The Syrian government started the process of repairing the stadium after the conclusion of the Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì2016). Iran has assisted Syria with repairs.

Album information In the 1970s in the Greek music industry, the prerequisite to recording a personal album was to prove one's artistic merits by collaborating and recording with other established musicians. Having proved herself by collaborating with the legendary Mikis Theodorakis and other influential artists like George Dalaras, record company Minos finally granted Vissi the privilege of recording her debut personal studio album. The album featured new songs and songs previously included in various composer albums. The lead single, \\"As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi\\" was sung by Vissi at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, on September 26, 1977, prior to the album release, winning first prize. In 1987, \\"As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi\\" was among the selection of albums that Minos-EMI decided to release on CD as it was still popular. The Minos EMI reissue for the back catalogue Minos EMI CD Club series, which was regularly shipped in shops throughout the years, is shown here. In 2006 it was re-released in a remasted edition including a bonus CD with additional songs from her early career with Minos featured on albums of other successful artists. In 2007 the songs of the album were included on EMI's boxset of Vissi recordings Back to Time (Complete EMI Years) which, despite of being a box set, charted on the Top 10 of sales charts. =Music= Music and lyrics are by Doros Georgiadis, Spiros Blassopoulos, Antonis Vardis, Panos Falaras, Giannis Spanos, Manos Eleftheriou, M.

The site was part of the Legislative Governmental Mall. The entire Mall is often referred to as the plaza. Much like the National Mall on which it is loosely based, the Legislative Governmental Mall is intended as an open-air public space with monuments, memorials and gardens. Some of these monuments were erected before the plaza itself, such as the monument to , dedicated on December 7, 1976. The plaza's location in front of the state capitol has made it a meeting place and a focal point for protests and demonstrations.

DeMille and his 1956 film The Ten Commandments; it was moved to the park more than a decade later. In 2003, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union tried to have it removed arguing that it serves no secular purpose and thus violates the separation of church and state. The monument remains in the plaza. =Arizona 9/11 Memorial= The memorial to commemorate the September 11, 2001, attacks was unveiled on the fifth anniversary of the attacks, September 11, 2006. After some people complained that the memorial contained anti-American sentiment, the commission in charge of the memorial's design and construction has promised to review it and make changes if necessary. = Arizona Confederate Troops Memorial= In the early 1960s, the United Daughters of the Confederacy funded a \\"Memorial to Confederate Soldiers\\" as part of the group's efforts to memorialize the short-lived eight month occupation (August 1861 to March 1862) of the so-called Confederate Arizona. On June 19, 2020, Sean Brennan doused the stone \\"Memorial to Confederate Soldiers\\" with red paint before a peaceful protest in support of Black Lives Matter.

Prelude In December 1946, after the failed attempts to take Easy County (Yi Xian, ÊòìÂéø) and Full City (Man Cheng, Êª°Âüé) regions, the Nationalists redeployed their forces along the railroad from Beijing to Baoding to fragment the enemy base into smaller pieces. However, when carrying out the new strategy, the Nationalist force was overstretched and the region between Wangdu (ÊúõÈÉΩ) and Zhengding to the south of Baoding was thinly manned: the vast area of over 200 km was only guarded by a detachment of the 32nd Division of the Nationalist 3rd Army and four regiments of the Nationalist 5th Security Division, totaling 20,000 troops. The Communists decided to use this advantage to launch a campaign aimed at severing the Nationalist communication / transportation line in central Hebei, thus cutting off the food supply for the Nationalists in western Hebei. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle: *The 3rd Army **The 32nd Division *The 5th Security Division Communist order of battle: *The 2nd Column *The 4th Column *The Independent 1st Brigade *The Independent 8th Brigade The Campaign The Communist 10th Brigade, the 11th Brigade, the Independent 1st Brigade and units of the 3rd and 9th Military Districts were tasked with the main responsibilities of the campaign, while the 8th Independent Brigade would launch assaults along the railroad around Gaobei Hotel (Gao Bei Dian, È´òÁ¢ëÂ∫ó) region to the north of Baoding to tie down the Nationalists in order to prevent them from reinforcing their forces in the south. The Communist 2nd and 3rd Column would be based at the town of Sun City (Yang Cheng Zhen Èò≥ÂüéÈïá) and White Bunker Town (Bai Bao Zhen, ÁôΩÂ†°Èïá), waiting to ambush the Nationalist reinforcements if there was any. At dawn on January 21, 1947, under the cover of a heavy snowstorm, the Communist 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade launched surprise attacks on the Imperial Capital Village (Áéã‰∫¨Êùë) and the town of Wangdu (ÊúõÈÉΩ), successfully taking both Nationalist strongholds and completely annihilating the Nationalist garrison consisting of a battalion and a regiment of the Nationalist 5th Security Division in the process. Meanwhile, Communist 1st Independent Brigade and units from the 3rd and the 9th Military Districts launched their offensives on Nationalist positions along the railroad. On the night of January 21 the Communist 4th Column succeeded in penetrating into the region between the towns of Xinle (Êñ∞‰πê) and Ding County. On January 23 the Communist 4th Column lalunched a successful effort to take the region of Camp West Hotel (Zhai Xi Dian, ÂØ®Ë•ø Â∫ó), while the bulk of its force was deployed along the railroad to ambush any Nationalist reinforcements. On January 24 Nationalist reinforcements from Zhengding, consisting of a regiment of the 5th Security Division and a portion of the 32nd Division Division, was completely wiped out by the waiting Communist 4th Column in the region of Shijiading (ÂçÅÂÆ∂Áî∫). Learning the news of the disaster, the Nationalist defenders of the town of Xinle (Êñ∞‰πê) were forced to abandon their position when the Communist 1st Independent Brigade attacked. On January 28 the Communist 4th Column launched the final assault on the besieged town of Ding County, badly mauling the Nationalist brigade defending the town. As the Nationalist survivors attempted to flee, they were ambushed by the Communist 2nd Column at Wangdu (ÊúõÈÉΩ) region; this complete victory concluded the campaign. Outcome The Nationalists suffered more than 8,000 casualties in their defeat, and the link between Shijiazhuang and Baoding was severed. Additionally, towns including Wangdu (ÊúõÈÉΩ), Ding (ÂÆö) County and Xinle (Êñ∞‰πê) fell into enemy hands, while the previously separated Communist bases in central Hebei and the border area of Hebei and Shanxi were successfully linked up by the enemy to form a new base of much larger size.

A surface lure is a fishing lure designed to waddle, pop, lock, drop, pulse, twitch or fizz across the surface of the water as it is retrieved, and in doing so imitate surface prey for fish such as mice, lizards, frogs, cicadas, moths and small injured fish. A typical surface lure has a solid body made out of wood or plastic, carries one or two treble hooks, and has an eyelet at the front of the lure body to attach the fishing line. Waddlers get their action from a scooped metal dish attached to the front of the lure body. Poppers get their action from a cupped face carved or molded into the front of the lure body. Fizzers get their action both from the fisherman manipulating the lure with the fishing rod and from one or more blades attached to the lure body, that spin when the lure is pulled and create a fizzing noise said to imitate the buzzing wings of a drowning insect. Sizeable fish can create a sudden, noisy and spectacular explosion when they take a surface lure, usually giving the fisherman a fright in the process. Catching fish on surface lures is therefore considered a fairly exciting form of fishing.

The school was formed in September 2010 from the merger of Menzies High School and Manor High School, both located in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell. Originally operating from both former school sites, the Phoenix Collegiate has been based entirely at the former Menzies High School site in Clarke's Lane, West Bromwich. This follows the closure of the former Manor High School buildings on the Friar Park estate in Wednesbury due to asbestos. History The origins of the school can be traced to West Bromwich Municipal Secondary School at the West Bromwich Institute, which opened in 1902 on Lodge Road, West Bromwich. It was funded by Sir George Kenrick. It became West Bromwich Grammar School in 1944, and moved to new buildings on Clarkes Lane in 1964. It was only a grammar school at this site for five years, becoming a comprehensive school in September 1969 when West Bromwich borough council (which merged with Warley five years later to form Sandwell) decided to make comprehensive education universal. The Menzies buildings were used as one of the filming locations for the 1986 film Clockwise, starring John Cleese. Manor High School opened in 1968 on the Friar Park estate, but exam results attained by school leavers were constantly low, and demand for places was falling by the 1990s as many pupils living in the catchment area chose to attend other schools. The two schools merged in September 2010 to form The Phoenix Collegiate, although the new school operates from both sites for two years until the Manor High buildings were closed in July 2012. From 1986/1987 the school had a mural by the artist Paula Woof.

Zaccaro & Company, which was founded by his father Philip Zaccaro. The company acts as a landlord for properties in the Little Italy, Chinatown, and East Side areas of Manhattan and previously in Queens. He is the widower of Geraldine Ferraro, former U.S. House of Representatives member from New York and the 1984 Democratic Party Vice Presidential nominee, who died in 2011. Early life and education Zaccaro was born in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn neighborhood, to Italian-American parents born in the U.S. When an infant the family moved, and he grew up in Forest Hills, Queens According to a biography issued by the Ferraro campaign in 1984, he attended Loyola School (described as \\"Loyola Military School\\") and Rhodes Preparatory School, both in Manhattan. Again according to the campaign, a severe football injury that occurred at Loyola left him with a 4-F classification and unavailable for the draft, but he nonetheless joined the United States Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class, becoming a second lieutenant. According to an account in Ms. Magazine in 1984, he had switched to baseball after the injury and coming out of high school was offered a spot in the Brooklyn Dodgers farm system. He attended Iona College from 1951 to 1955 and graduated with a degree in business administration.  Career  Zaccaro has been a licensed real estate broker since 1951 and a member of the Real Estate Board of New York since 1955. He started working as a salesman for his father, Phillip J. Zaccaro, who had established P. Zaccaro Co., Inc. in 1917. As an agent for the City of New York, the firm managed properties which were condemned by the City, upon which Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper Village, and Knickerbocker Village were built in the 1930s and 1940s. In the late 1970s, Zaccaro was appointed a member of the New York City Housing Council. By 1984, Zaccaro's company owned or managed over 20 residential and commercial properties in Manhattan. According to a New York Times article, Zaccaro's buildings had accumulated over 100 mostly minor code violations, but some serious, with tenants complaining of poor conditions in some of the apartments. Shortly after Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale selected Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate in the 1984 U.S. presidential election, Zaccaro became the center of controversy due to the couple's finances and his refusal to release his separately-filed tax returns. Ultimately they were submitted, but the matter diminished Ferraro's rising stardom and removed the momentum the Mondale‚ÄìFerraro ticket gained following the pick. Mondale and Ferraro lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent President Ronald Reagan, although political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election that year. In January 1985, Zaccaro pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining bank financing in a real estate transaction and was fined $1,000 and was sentenced to 150 hours of community service. Zaccaro stated afterward, \\"My lawyers have advised me that since my client and I withdrew the loan application, since no one but I was injured, and since I received no benefit, they felt that they could successfully defend this case\\" but he said he entered the plea to spare his family more publicity and to \\"conclude the matter and try to return to private life.\\" In October 1986, he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted of all charges at trial. Zaccaro's business associations have also created controversy, and they and the couple's finances again became a damaging issue during Ferraro's 1992 Senate Democratic primary campaign (which she entered as the front-runner, and lost by a close margin). Zaccaro was not an issue in her 1998 Senate Democratic primary campaign, which she also lost. P. Zaccaro Co., Inc. continues as a third-generation, privately held real estate investment, development, and management firm that specializes in Manhattan. As principal for over 50 years, Zaccaro has been involved in every aspect of the real estate industry as a manager, broker, developer, or principal. Some of his past clients are the Emigrant Savings Bank, Bowery Savings Bank, and New York University. Zaccaro now works with his son, John Jr., a licensed attorney and real estate broker. The firm's deals have sometimes been valued into the tens of millions of dollars and involved other New York real estate figures such as Jared Kushner. Zaccaro has been appointed as a trustee in bankruptcy by the courts of New York, Queens, and Kings Counties. Zaccaro has also served as a trustee at various independent schools in the city, including Saint David's School and Convent of the Sacred Heart. He is currently a member of the board of directors of his co-op where he resides.  Personal life  Zaccaro and Ferraro met in 1954, when she was a sophomore at Marymount Manhattan College. They became engaged in August 1959, and married on July 16, 1960. They had three children, Donna (born 1962), John Jr. (born 1964), and Laura (born 1966). The former Congresswoman died on March 26, 2011.Martin, Douglas, \\"Geraldine A.

It has become well known as the melody to which Patrick Kavanagh's On Raglan Road is sung. It is often played as a march and is one of the first tunes that a student of Irish music will learn. O'Connellan's \\"F√°inne Geal an Lae\\" is often confused with the later pentatonic melody to which the words \\"The Dawning of the Day\\" is set. The O'Connellan air is different in a number of respects, although there are melodic resemblances. Words are still sung to variants of it which mostly use only the first half of the air as printed in Bunting and other collections. The Irish-language lyrics of \\"F√°inne Geal an Lae\\" describe an aisling where the poet encounters a mysterious beautiful woman. In this case, she upbraids him as a frivolous rake and points to the approaching dawn. Lyrics Notes: Helen of Troy is used in the translation rather than the literal Venus simply for its rhythm. The final verse is a poetical rather than literal translation, which would be: :She said to me \\"go away :and let me go - you rake! :there from the south the light is coming :with the dawning of the day\\" Irish :Maidin moch do ghabhas amach, :Ar bruachaibh Locha L√©in; :An Samhradh 'g teacht a's an chraobh len' ais, :Is lonrach te √≥n ngr√©in, :Ar thaisteal dom tr√≠ bhailte poirt :Is b√°nta m√≠ne r√©idhe, :C√© do gheobhainn lem ais ach an ch√∫ileann deas, :Le f√°inne geal an lae. :N√≠ raibh br√≥g n√° stoca, caidhp n√° cl√≥c; :Ar mo st√≥irin √≥g √≥n sp√©ir, :Ach an folt fionn √≥rga s√≠os go troigh, :Ag f√°s go barr an fh√©ir. :Bh√≠ cal√°n cr√∫ite aici ina glaic, :A's ar dhr√∫cht ba dheas a sc√©imh, :Do rug barra gean ar Bh√©ineas dheas, :Le f√°inne geal an lae. :Do shuigh an bhrideog s√≠os lem ais, :Ar bhinse glas den fh√©ar, :Ag magadh l√©i bh√≠os d√° ma√≠omh go pras, :Mar mhnaoi n√° scarfainn l√©i. :'S √© d√∫irt s√≠ liomsa, \\"imigh uaim, :Is scaoil ar si√∫l m√©, a r√©ic\\", :Sin iad aneas na soilse ag teacht, :Le f√°inne geal an lae.

The Hut Tax War of 1898 was a resistance in the newly annexed Protectorate of Sierra Leone to a new tax imposed by the colonial governor. The British had established the Protectorate to demonstrate their dominion over the territory to other European powers following the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì1885.David Harris, Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia, I.B. Tauris, 2012, p. 40 The tax constituted a major burden on residents of the Protectorate; 24 indigenous chiefs had signed a petition against it, explaining its adverse effects on their societies, to no avail. The immediate catalyst for hostilities was the use of force by British officials to arrest the Temne chief Bai Bureh, a general and war strategist, on the basis of rumours. Although often depicted as the chief who initiated an armed resistance in the North in 1898, late 20th-century sources suggest he was unfairly identified by the colonial government as a primary instigator, with the government's hostile actions provoking the war. Later that year, resistance arose in the south by the leading Mende. Cardew's tax The governor of Sierra Leone, Colonel Frederic Cardew, had decreed that to pay for the British administration, the Protectorate's residents had to pay a tax based on the size of their huts. Cardew, who was not an administrator but a professional soldier with service in India and South Africa, revealed his ignorance of the lives of most residents by the severity of the tax. The owner of a four-roomed hut was to be taxed ten shillings a year; those with smaller huts would pay five shillings. Cardew's staff failed to advise him that the taxes, first imposed on 1 January 1898, often were higher than the value of the dwellings. In addition, the government taxed unoccupied dwellings. Lastly, Cardew's demands that the chiefs organize their own residents to maintain the roads ignored the fact that the people needed to devote their labour to subsistence farming in order to survive.Edward Breck, \\"In Foreign Lands: The Sierra Leone Massacre\\", New York Times (29 May 1898). A total of 24 chiefs signed a petition to the colonial government explaining why these requirements were so burdensome and threatened their societies. In addition, the chiefs believed the tax was an attack on their sovereignty. Bai Bureh's revolt The new requirements sparked two rebellions in the hinterland of Sierra Leone in 1898, one in the northern area of the Temne, led by Bai Bureh, a general and military strategist, and the other in the southern area by the Mende, led by Momoh Jah. The British issued a warrant to arrest Bai Bureh, the 61-year-old chief of the Temne, with the idea that a display of force would convince the natives to pay the taxes due. By February this had provoked open warfare, with resistance spreading. But Bai Bureh continued to make peace overtures in April and June, including through the mediation of Limba chief Alamy Suluku of Bumban, which Cardew rejected, saying that the general had to surrender without condition. Bai Bureh had gained the support of several prominent native chiefs, including the powerful Kissi chief Kai Londo and the Limba chief Suluku. Both chiefs sent warriors and weapons to aid Bai Bureh, who felt he had to defend himself against the aggression of district commissioner Captain Sharpe. Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the better armed British for several months of the war, with high casualties on both sides.www.sierra-leone.org. Retrieved on 17 January 2007 . Some innocent European and Africans were also killed. In one case, Johnny Taylor, a Creole trader, was \\"chopped\\" to pieces by Bai Bureh's warriors. As frustration grew, Governor Cardew realized that the war not easily winnable so he ordered a \\"scorched earth policy\\" where the British would burn entire villages, farmlands, and pastures. This change in tactics significantly affected Bai Bureh's war effort, as it reduced provisions to feed not only his warriors but his subjects as well. He also realized that the cost of reparations was getting insurmountable as the British were relentless in pursuing the new policy. To save his people from more property loses, Bai Bureh finally gave up the fight, surrendering on 11 November 1898. Despite the British government's recommendation of leniency, the acting governor had Bai Bureh and two colleagues sent into exile in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The British convicted and hanged 96 of his comrades. Bai Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he reassumed chieftaincy of Kasseh. Bai Bureh gave an account of his side to Rev. Allen Elba, who sent an account to Cardew, although historians have ignored this material. Mende revolt The Southern front was based in the Southern provinces, and was led mainly by Mende (and a few Sherbro) warriors and chiefs. In this area, the warriors killed many Creole and civil servants living in the provinces. Lieutenant Colonel Marshall, the British commander, wrote that the operations, from February to November 1898, involved some of the most stubborn fighting that has been seen in West Africa. No such continuity of opposition had at any previous time been experienced on this part of the coast. Aftermath For the British, this had been one of the larger West African colonial campaigns of the nineteenth century. Apart from support units and a 280 strong naval brigade, British‚Äìled forces consisted of West India Regiment and African troops led by British officers, including the West Africa Regiment, Sierra Leone Police and local levies. These forces together suffered 67 killed and 184 wounded, in addition to the death of 90 non-combatant carriers, plus loses among the local levies which were not recorded. The defeat in the Hut Tax War ended large-scale organised armed opposition to colonialism in Sierra Leone. But resistance and opposition took other forms, particularly intermittent, wide-scale rioting and chaotic labour disturbances. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved \\"many tens of thousands\\" of natives in the protectorate.Martin Killson, Political Change in a West African State: A Study of the Modernization Process in Sierra Leone, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, 1966, p. 60.

In 2009 Ofsted highlighted Wood Green as one of 12 outstanding schools serving disadvantaged communities.Twelve outstanding secondary schools - Excelling against the odds , Ofsted, 24 February 2009. Retrieved 23 February 2011. Admissions The head teacher is Mr. James Topham, who started the role in September 2014, taking over from Mr Pank Patel who after a successful 7 years at Wood Green has become the West Midlands Regional Schools Commissioner. Pank succeeded the retiring Dame Enid Bibby, who had been head teacher for eight years and became a dame in 2004 in recognition of her achievements at the school. The school is situated on the A461 Wood Green Road which connects Wednesbury with Walsall, just south of the (elevated) M6 motorway at junction 9 and next to St Paul's church and IKEA on the Wednesbury Retail Park. History =Grammar school= The school's origins go back to the turn of the 20th century, when Wednesbury Boys' High School opened as a grammar school. It opened in Wood Green House, St. Paul's Road in 1924 under the headship of C. H. S. Kipping. The school was sometimes also referred to as Wednesbury Grammar School. The school motto was Arte Marte Vigore, which was also the motto of the Borough of Wednesbury. Many new school buildings were added in 1961. Former members of the school are known as \\"Old Wodens\\" and The Old Wodens Society still meets bi-annually. =Comprehensive= The buildings were expanded during the 1950s, and by 1970 the school had turned comprehensive. In 1968 it joined with Wood Green Secondary Modern School to become Wood Green Bilateral School. The Wednesbury Girls' High School, a girls' grammar school, joined the sixth form. It became Wood Green High School in September 1969, serving pupils of both sexes. The school includes a sixth form for pupils aged over 16. Academic performance Wood Green is one of the most successful schools in Sandwell, and has regularly topped the borough's GCSE tables since the year 2000, well above the England average. In 2006, it was the best performing of the borough's 18 secondary schools. The results in 2013 were excellent with 68% of students achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grades A*-C including Maths and English. 100% of students passed their A-levels.

It was composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet. The music for the film is noted for its minimalist qualities in which it uses constant harmonies, a steady pulse, and often variation of musical phrases to drive a point. The album is best known for the track \\"Lux Aeterna.\\" Background With the success of the film also came a successful soundtrack. Composer of the soundtrack Clint Mansell has worked very closely with Darren Aronofsky throughout his movie career. Mansell also has worked on Aronofsky's first film œÄ. Both Pi and Requiem for a Dream are noted for their off notes and range of tenebrous emotions. In the opening credits before the title of the movie appears we can hear the quartet tuning their instruments, before hearing a conductor tap on his music stand to ready the quartet for a performance. The maestro bringing them to attention is Aronofsky. Aronofsky and Mansell both grew up listening to Hiphop which they based a lot of their decision making on that type of music. Mansell took a classic hiphop record and reworked it with the score. Aronofsky saw Requiem as a \\"monster movie, only when something goes bad you hear the music.\\" All of the music in the film is influenced by the characters and goes with the drugs in the film. Even though none of the characters actually say the word \\"Heroin\\", they still base the music around heroin and cravings. The soundtrack has been widely praised, and in particular the track \\"Lux Aeterna\\" (which itself is much used in the film) has subsequently been used in various forms of media. The theme was reorchestrated for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers trailer and is known by the name \\"Requiem for a Tower\\", presented by \\"Corner Stone Cues\\". The theme has been featured in trailers for other films, including Babylon A.D.,Babylon A.D. Official Trailer. YouTube (2008-08-29). Retrieved on 2010-12-15. The Da Vinci Code,The Da Vinci Code official trailer. YouTube (2007-09-05). Retrieved on 2010-12-15. I Am Legend,I AM LEGEND ‚Äì Movie Trailer. YouTube. Retrieved on 2010-12-15. Sunshine,Sunshine Trailer. YouTube. Retrieved on 2010-12-15. and Valley of Flowers.Valley Of Flowers Trailer. YouTube. Retrieved on 2010-12-15. It also appeared in the video games \\"Total Miner: Forge\\" (Xbox Live Indie Game 2011), Assassin's Creed, and in numerous TV spots and advertisements, and at sporting events. Use of the theme has extended to the point where it is interchangeable with the name \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\" A remix album, Requiem for a Dream: Remixed, contained new mixes of the music by Paul Oakenfold, Josh Wink, Jagz Kooner, and Delerium, among others.[ Track listing on Allmusic] The Kronos Quartet The Kronos Quartet is the string quartet that performed the soundtrack for Requiem for a Dream. The quartet was founded in 1973 by David Harrington in Seattle. The members were David Harrington and John Sherba, violins; Hank Dutt, viola; and Joan Jeanrenaud, cello. The group was chosen for its minimalist approach. Critical reception Reviews have generally been very favorable. Allmusic gave the album four stars, saying that the score \\"manages to be appropriately dark and disturbing, as well as compulsively listenable\\"; Salon praised the \\"terrific musical score\\"; and The Observer of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College called the score \\"heart-stopping\\". Filmcritic.com, in a negative review of the score, spoke of \\"the driving, thumping, angry, brutal violin score which drums like a hammer and chain beating you into submission.\\" Inspirations The novel Requiem for a Dream was written by Hubert Selby Jr. who was inspired to write it when he lived in LA. He wanted to write about something in the real world rather than something from the fantasy genre. One of the main influences of his work was his life experiences. Hubert‚Äôs life was very unfortunate; at the age of 18, he was a merchant seaman during World War II. During that time he was hospitalized for three years for treatment of tuberculosis and other illnesses or injuries he acquired. Six months before Hubert wrote Requiem for a Dream, he was sick with pneumonia, going in and out of comas. His wife was worried about his health but he refused to go to a hospital. One night, his wife woke up from a dream about two spirits that had opened the door in their room; she says that she could tell that they were male and female. The two spirits told her that if Hubert did not get medical attention, he might die. She eventually called a friend, who happened to be a respiratory therapist. She told him about all the things that have been happening with Hubert and he scolded him about his health and told her to take him to the hospital. Composer Clint Mansell, the composer of this soundtrack, is an English musician, composer, and former lead singer and guitarist of the band Pop Will Eat Itself (1996). Aronofsky, the director of the film, hired him to score his film Pi. He scored Requiem for a Dream in 2000, and all of Aronofsky's films since.

Although she was well known, her contemporaries usually referred to her only as \\"Madame\\" or \\"Mrs.\\" Montour. She may have been Isabelle (or Elizabeth) Couc, a M√©tis born in 1667, or perhaps Isabelle Couc's niece, who was born around 1685 and whose given name is uncertain. In 1711, Madame Montour began working as an interpreter and diplomatic consultant for the province of New York. Around 1727, she and her husband Carondawana, an Oneida, moved to the province of Pennsylvania. Her village, known Otstonwakin, was at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The modern borough of Montoursville, named for her, developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War. Montour's son Andrew Montour also became an important interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia, as did his son John Montour. Some of Madame Montour's female relatives were prominent local leaders in New York and Pennsylvania, and have often been confused with her by historians. Identity debate There has been confusion about details of Madame Montour's life. She has often been confounded with her female relatives, particularly Catharine Montour, who was prominent in western New York. Historians have long attempted to separate fact from fiction and piece together her life from a few records and conflicting names. Much is uncertain about Madame Montour's early life. In 1744, Witham Marshe met the \\"celebrated Mrs. Montour\\" at an important treaty conference held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Parmenter, 141. When asked about her background, Montour told Marshe that she had been born in Canada to a French father. She said that she had been captured by the Iroquois about fifty years earlier (i.e. around 1694), when she was about ten years old, and that she did not remember much about her parents. She had been adopted and raised by the Iroquois, she said. She eventually married Carondawana, an Oneida war chief, with whom she had several children before his death in battle in 1729.Parmenter, 141‚Äì42; Sivertsen, 94. See Witham Marshe's Journal, Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1801), 1st series, 7:189‚Äì91. In 1974, historian William A. Hunter tentatively identified Madame Montour as Elizabeth Couc, a m√©tis born in 1667 near Trois-Rivi√®res, New France, in what is now Quebec, Canada. Elizabeth (also known as Isabelle, which was used interchangeably in French at the time) Couc was one of five children recorded for Pierre Couc dit Lafleur (1627‚Äì1690), a French-born fur trader and interpreter, and Marie Miteoamegoukou√© (1631‚Äì1699), a Christian Algonquin woman.Hirsch, 84; Sivertsen, 96. Hunter conceded that some of the evidence connecting Madame Montour with Elizabeth Couc was \\"vague and contradictory\\". He accepted that Madame Montour had been captured by an Iroquois war party around 1695, but if she was Elizabeth Couc, she was much older than ten at the time. Hirsch and Sivertsen have explained the discrepancies by suggesting that Madame Montour was deliberately vague about her past; this allowed her to present a different account of herself in Pennsylvania as a genteel French woman, albeit one in Indian dress.Hirsch, 96; Sivertsen, 95‚Äì96. Elizabeth (or √âlisabeth) Couc apparently also used the name of Isabelle, the French form of Elizabeth; the two names were then interchangeable.Hirsch, 85n11. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch uncovered a record from 1711 that lists payments to \\"Eysabelle Montour interpretress\\", the only known reference to Montour's first name in an English document.Hirsch, 93. Isabelle Couc presumably had an Algonquin name too, but it is unknown.Hirsch, 84. Parmenter and Hagedorn are among contemporary historian who have argued that Madame Montour was not Isabelle Couc, but rather her niece.Charles A. Hanna, The Wilderness Trail (New York, 1911), 1:200, was perhaps the first to argue that Madame Montour was the daughter of Louis Couc, and thus Isabelle Couc's niece. Hagedorn (p. 44) and Parmenter (p. 143) support that view. According to this interpretation, Montour was born in an Indian village near modern Sorel, Quebec, around 1685, a year consistent with the story that she told Marshe. Her parents were Louis Couc Montour, who was the brother of Isabelle Couc, and Madeleine, a Sokoki (Western Abenaki) woman.Parmenter, 143‚Äì45; Hagedorn, 308n1. If Madame Montour was born in 1685, her birth apparently went unrecorded, and her first name is uncertain.Parmenter, 147. Although Parmenter's article is entitled \\"Isabel Montour\\", in the text he says that her given name in unclear, and refers to her only as \\"Madame Montour\\". Her given name has also been represented as Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, and Madeleine.Hirsch, 83. Marriage and family As pieced together by Hirsch, Madame Montour was Isabelle Couc and led an eventful life before beginning her career in New York as an interpreter for the British. In 1684, Couc married Joachim Germano, with whom she had at least one child.Hirsch, 87‚Äì88. By the 1690s she was living in Michilimakinac (present-day Michigan) with two of her sisters and their husbands, who worked as interpreters in the fur trading center. Isabelle may also have worked as an interpreter for Sieur de Cadillac, the local French commander. Cadillac would later claim that Isabelle led a \\"dissolute life\\", and had more than one hundred male lovers; some historians attribute his vitriol to some personal bias.Hirsch, 90. When Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit in 1701, Isabelle evidently relocated there with her new husband, Pierre Tichenet. She became involved with √âtienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont; when he deserted the fort in 1706, she fled with him. Her experience in the northwest territory gave her more exposure to a variety of Algonquian and Iroquois languages, increasing her facility in each. Perhaps around 1708,Hirsch, 93n43 Madame Montour married an Oneida war captain named Carondawana. (If Madame Montour was instead the niece of Isabelle Couc, Carondawana was probably her only husband.) The couple had a son about 1720 named Andrew Montour, who would become a well-known interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Iroquois kinship terms often described a woman's niece as her daughter, for example, so there is confusion about the identities of Madame Montour's other possible children.Wallace, 569. Another boy, Lewis (Louis) Montour, was possibly her son, or perhaps her nephew.Parmenter, 147. \\"French Margaret\\" Montour, a woman often described as Madame Montour's daughter, may have been a niece.Hirsch, 97. In the simplified family tree chart shown below, the names in green are the two women who have been identified as Madame Montour. Andrew Montour is connected on the chart to both of his potential mothers. Similarly, because it is uncertain if French Margaret was Madame Montour's daughter or niece, the chart illustrates both possibilities. Career in New York The first Montour to come to prominence was Louis Montour, who was Madame Montour's brother or father. Born Louis Couc, he adopted \\"Montour\\" as his surname in the 1680s.Hirsch, 87. During King William's War (1689‚Äì1697), Montour and other Indians in Canada fought against British-allied Iroquois from the province of New York. At this time an Iroquois raiding party may have captured his daughter, who, according to some interpretations, became known as \\"Madame Montour\\".Parmenter, 143. Louis Montour relocated to Michilimakinac in the 1690s, where he worked as a fur trader. After King William's War ended, he began to facilitate trade between western Algonquians and merchants in Albany, New York. He accompanied the \\"Far Indians\\" to Albany. This lucrative enterprise diverted profits from New France to New York, and promoted diplomatic ties between the Iroquois and the western nations.Parmenter, 144. Officials in New France saw this as a threat. In 1709, during Queen Anne's War, Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire and his men assassinated Louis Montour on orders from Governor Vaudreuil.Parmenter, 144‚Äì45. where the man assassinated in 1709 is identified as \\"Alexander Montour, the son of a French officer and a Mohawk woman\\". After Louis Montour's murder, Madame Montour emerged as his successor, identified as Mountour's sister and benefiting from some of the trust accorded to him. Although she evidently could not read or write, she was valuable as an interpreter, able to speak French, English, and several languages in both the Algonquian and Iroquoian families.Hirsch, 82n2, 92. With family connections throughout the region, she was also an ideal cultural intermediary. According to historian Jon Parmenter, Madame Montour's role as a \\"behind the scenes\\" consultant was even more important than her work as an interpreter.Parmenter, 146-49. When Robert Hunter became governor of New York in 1710, Madame Montour became his personal interpreter and one of his most trusted advisers. They communicated in French. Her husband Carondawana took the English name \\"Robert Hunter\\" to honor the governor.Hirsch, 94; Parmenter, 147. He became \\"king\\" of the Algonquian-speaking Shawnee in Pennsylvania in 1714, and traveled between there and New York with Madame Montour for years, strengthening connections between them and the Iroquois. Although Madame Montour served as an interpreter through the 1710s, there are few records of her activities at this time.Parmenter, 150; Hirsch, 94‚Äì95. In 1719, she petitioned New York for back pay, although with Governor Hunter's departure in 1720, she may not have received it. According to historian Alison Duncan Hirsch, the wording of an official recommendation about Montour's salary \\"has been misread to mean that she was asking to be paid the same as a man\\"; rather, she wanted the pay of an interpreter, which was higher than that of a common soldier.Hirsch, 96. Life in Pennsylvania At some point, Madame Montour and her family migrated to the province of Pennsylvania. Exactly when and why she moved is unclear. She may have been traveling between New York and Pennsylvania as early as 1714, when her husband Carondawana was appointed as the Iroquois spokesman for the Shawnee living in Pennsylvania. By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Otstonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town.Not to be confused with the nearby French Margaret's Town; see John Franklin Meginness, Otzinachson: A History of the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna (rev. ed., Williamsport, PA, 1889), 1:94. Ostonwakin is also spelled Otstonwakin. The site of previous Native American villages, Otstonwakin was located along the Great Shamokin Path, at the important confluence of Loyalsock Creek with the West Branch Susquehanna River, on the west bank of the river. The modern borough of Montoursville developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.Hirsch, 97‚Äì98. Because of her cultural knowledge of Native American affairs and facility with both the Iroquoian and Algonquian language families, Montour was sought as an adviser by Pennsylvania officials and private traders. She first appears in the Pennsylvania historical record in July 1727 as an interpreter at a council in Philadelphia between Governor Patrick Gordon and an Iroquois group.Hirsch, 98. Madame Montour and Carondawana had a close relationship with Shikellamy, a noted Oneida diplomat who benefited from the couple's cultural and linguistic expertise.Parmenter, 152‚Äì53. In 1729, Carondawana was killed fighting against the southern Catawba, traditional foes of the Iroquois.Parmenter, 153. After her husband's death, Madame Montour was gradually excluded from Pennsylvania diplomacy by Shikellamy and his colonial associate Conrad Weiser, who wanted to keep tight control of the province's relationship with the Iroquois. After 1734, she no longer appeared at councils in an official capacity.Parmenter, 153‚Äì55. She retired to her village, where she operated a trading post and supply depot, and raised her son Andrew Montour to be an interpreter and diplomat.Parmenter, 155. During the 1740s, Madame Montour met several Moravian missionaries who were evangelizing in Pennsylvania. Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, bishop of the Moravian Church, visited Otstonwakin in 1742 on his journey to Onondaga, the Iroquois capital in western New York.Hirsch, 105. He delivered a sermon in French, during which Madame Montour reportedly wept. Montour asked Zinzendorf to baptize two Indian children, but he declined, explaining that the Moravians did not perform baptisms in a village without first establishing a mission there. \\"She left me displeased\\", wrote Zinzendorf. In 1744, Montour attended the conference for the treaty of Lancaster, where she told her story to Witham Marshe, as described above. Marshe, like others, thought that Montour was a French woman captured by and raised among the Indians, rather than a m√©tis of partial French ancestry. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch has argued that the captivity story Montour told to Marshe was a fiction she created to reinvent herself in Pennsylvania, claiming her father had been a governor of New France.Hirsch, 96, 106‚Äì07. By 1745, Madame Montour had left Otstonwakin and was living with her son Andrew on an island in the Susquehanna River near the Native village of Shamokin, which was settled by Delaware, Oneida and Siouan- speaking Tutelo.Hirsch, 107. In March 1746, Andrew took her west, across the Appalachian Mountains to Logstown on the Ohio River. She was reportedly going blind by that time. This was her last appearance in the historical record, aside from a brief statement made by trader John Harris in January 1753: \\"Madame Montour is dead.\\"Hirsch, 109‚Äì110. Exactly when and where she died is unknown. Legacy Madame Mountour's village of Otstonwakin was located at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River Madame Montour has numerous descendants, and many Iroquois people still carry the Montour name.Parmenter, 156. Montoursville, Pennsylvania, which was founded near the site of Otstonwakin, was named for her. Montour County, Pennsylvania, and Montour Falls, New York, are just two of the places named for her descendants and relatives. Montour's role as interpreter and cultural go- between was continued by her son, Andrew Montour, who shared his mother's gift for languages. He worked as an interpreter for Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Sir William Johnson's Indian Department. Andrew Montour was appointed as a captain in George Washington's regiment at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. He was granted of land by Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He left Montoursville at some point and moved to what now is Juniata County before finally settling on Montour's Island in the Ohio River near Pittsburgh. Madame Montour may have had another son, Lewis (or Louis) Montour, whose Indian name was apparently Tau-wesonHirsch, 109n80. or Tan Weson.Sivertsen, 110. He may have been her nephew rather than her son. Little is known about him. He served as a messenger, and was reportedly killed in the French and Indian War. Madame Montour's daughter or niece, Margaret, sometimes known as \\"French Margaret\\", became the leader of French Margaret's Town, an Indian settlement at the mouth of Lycoming Creek a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Margaret Montour's daughter Catharine Montour also became a noted local leader, and many 19th-century historians confused her with Madame Montour. AT least four streams in Pennsylvania were named after her; see Montour Run.

B√∂rringekloster Castle (), formerly B√∂rringe Priory () is a castle built in 1763 on the ruins of a medieval Benedictine priory at Svedala in Scania, Sweden.  B√∂rringe Priory  The priory was founded about 1150 under Eskil, Archbishop of Lund, for Benedictine monks. However, by 1231 B√∂rringe Priory is mentioned in Liber Census Daniae as a convent located on the island of Byrding√∏ in B√∂rringe Lake, on land which Valdemar II of Denmark had once set aside for hunting. The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the convent was later also known as St. Mary's Priory. The building complex began small, but with the income from donations of money and rent properties, the priory was able to expand into three ranges attached to the church forming a four-sided enclosure to separate the nuns from the world. The nuns slept in the dormitory, another range contained a refectory and cellars, and a third was used for laywomen who lived in the priory, often the unmarried daughters or sisters of noble families who lived a religious life but were not strictly bound by the vows the nuns took. Occasionally, a widow exchanged her worldly goods for the opportunity to live out her life at the priory which provided room and board until her death. Housing these women was one source of income for the priory. Other income came from rent properties such as farms. While not specifically mentioned another common source of income was part of the tithes from nearby churches given by the Archdiocese of Lund for the maintenance of the nuns. Lastly the priory might also receive royal support in the form of rights to fishing grounds in B√∂rringe Lake or landing rights for commerce over streams or rivers. The priory was rebuilt over several decades during the 14th century in the Gothic style out of brick. Religious leadership and the internal running of the community was the responsibility of the prioress, while a prior, often a local noble who paid for the privilege, was responsible for representing the nuns in worldly affairs. The kingdom of Denmark became Lutheran in 1536 under Christian III, a staunch Protestant. All religious houses and their attendant income properties reverted to the crown for disposition. B√∂rringe Priory was secularized the same year and became an estate which the king gave to the Brahe family with the condition that the former nuns were to be cared for, essentially a home for honourable and noble women. The entire archive was lost. The church was converted into a parish church for the village of B√∂rringe. In 1551, the former priory estate passed to the nobleman Knud Gedde, and was apparently used as living quarters by tenant farmers. In 1582 it passed to Lady G√∂rvel Sparre who ordered the conventual church demolished, and the materials to be used for the construction of a new parish church closer to the town, which was completed by 1587. The grave of Lady Else Brade from the former priory church was moved under the floor of the new parish church. Usable parts of the former conventual buildings were converted into a large manor house. B√∂rringekloster Castle  At the beginning of the 16th century, B√∂rringe was owned by S√∏ren Norby, who together with the knight Jens Holgersen Ulfstand of Glimmingehus Castle, led the Danish navy to victory in several battles against L√ºbeck. When Scania became a Swedish province at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, Charles X of Sweden gave B≈èrringe Priory Manor to his illegitimate son, Gustaf Carlsson. Charles XI took the property and made it available to the General Governor of Scania, Count Gustaf Otto Stenbock. In 1682, Charles XI exchanged the estate for Herrevad Abbey with Otto Wilhelm von K√∂nigsmarck, son of Hans Christoff von K√∂nigsmarck, but in 1686, the estate reverted to the crown again. The B√∂rringe Priory estate was bought by the Beck-Friis family in 1745. In 1763, the remaining manor house and structures were demolished and replaced by the present castle. In 1873 the present castle was expanded and renovated into its present appearance. The estate became a joint County (earldom) with Fiholm Castle in S√∂dermanland in 1791 and the Swedish nobility title of Count was awarded to the new owners. There are no remnants of the former priory to be seen, except for a few fragments from the monastic church now in the B√∂rringe burial ground. B√∂rringe Church B√∂rringe Church B√∂rringe Parish was combined with Lemmestr√∂ Parish in 1741. Both of the old churches were demolished and B√∂rringe Church (B√∂rringe kyrka) was constructed for the new joint Gustav Parish in the Diocese of Lund.

At the onset of muscle contraction, gross changes in the muscle shape cause a large peak in the MMG. Subsequent vibrations are due to oscillations of the muscle fibres at the resonance frequency of the muscle. The mechanomyogram is also known as the phonomyogram, acoustic myogram, sound myogram, vibromyogram or muscle sound.  Signal characteristics  The MMG is a low frequency vibration that may be observed when a muscle is contracted using suitable measuring techniques.  Measurement techniques  It can be measured using an accelerometer or a microphone placed on the skin over the belly of the muscle. When measured using a microphone is may be termed the acoustic myogram.  Uses  The MMG may provide a useful alternative to the electromyogram (EMG) for monitoring muscle activity. It has a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the surface EMG and thus can be used to monitor muscle activity from deeper muscles without using invasive measurement techniques. It is currently the subject of research activity into prosthetic control and assistive technologies for the disabled.  History  Muscle sounds were first described in print by the Jesuit scientist Francesco Maria Grimaldi in a posthumous publication of 1665, which influenced the work of the English physician William Hyde Wollaston and the German physicist Paul Erman. The latter enlisted the aid of Ren√© Laennec. Mechanical amplification was first employed by Hermann von Helmholtz. The past two centuries of repeated rediscovery and neglect of the phenomenon were summarised by Stokes and Blythe in 2001.

It occurs in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, where it is the only pocket gopher. Description Closeup of its protruding teeth and fossorial claws The southeastern pocket gopher is rather smaller than the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), with a total length of including a tail of about . Males are larger than females and average in weight while the females average . The dorsal fur is cinnamon brown with the underparts rather paler and tinged with buff or reddish-yellow. The feet and tail are white or pale buff. As with other members of this family, the external cheek pouches can be turned inside-out for grooming purposes. It is well adapted for living underground with large, protruding incisor teeth, used for tearing at roots, and powerful claws on the forefeet for digging. Distribution and habitat This gopher is restricted to the southeastern part of the United States, where it occurs in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. It occupies several different dry, sandy habitats; it occurs in sand-hill country with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and turkey oak (Quercus laevis), and it also occurs in slightly moister hammocks (low mounds) among the sand-hills with Quercus virginiana and other hardwood trees. Away from the sand dunes, it occurs in longleaf pine woodland and scrubby sand pine (Pinus clausa) habitats. Its presence in any area is obvious because of the numerous piles of sandy soil it pushes to the surface. Ecology G. pinetis is a solitary animal and creates shallow tunnels above which are a series of mounds of excavated material. The soil is pushed upwards by the front limbs and chest and creates a fan-shaped mound with the tunnel at one side. The burrow entrance is immediately blocked with soil. These shallow tunnels are connected to a deeper tunnel system by a spiral \\"staircase\\". Down below are the food chambers and a nest chamber which may contain dried vegetation and plant fibres. Breeding takes place in spring and summer, peaking around February/March and June/July. The gestation period is about four weeks and the average litter size is two. Despite this low level of fecundity, the southeastern pocket gopher is a common animal, implying that there is good survivability of the offspring. The presence of green forage in the diet and the fact that owls sometimes feed on them show that the gophers do emerge above ground sometimes. However, predators underground are few, the chief dangers being snakes and weasels. The southeastern pocket gopher is active throughout the year. It feeds on roots and rhizomes below ground, and on green plants such as grasses, sedges and weeds which it can reach from near the entrance to the burrow. Large quantities of vegetation are gathered and carried back to store chambers in the burrow. A number of arthropods share the burrows with the gophers, including about fourteen species that are found nowhere else. The gophers are attracted to cultivated land, particularly sweet potato crops, and can also be a pest in peanut and pea crops, and sugarcane plantations.

The Banda Oriental had been awarded to Spain as a term of the Treaty of Madrid. It was within the Viceroyalty of Peru (1750‚àí1776), the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata (colonial Argentina region, 1776‚àí1814), the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata (. History The constant threat of the Portuguese Empire expanding from Colonial Brazil westward into the region was virtually impossible to deter, due to the lack of permanent Spanish settlement along the frontier. This, coupled with the possibility of attacks by the indigenous peoples defending their homelands and perhaps motivated by the Portuguese, convinced the Spanish Crown to establish this new jurisdiction in the recently founded city of Montevideo. Despite the fact that Montevideo was in those days a small village of minor significance, military considerations took precedence. The city's importance was soon elevated by its regional strategic value. At its creation, the jurisdiction's direct control did not extend beyond (two days on a horse). This zone was, in fact, the only area brought under effective royal control in the Banda Oriental. =Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata governors= The governors of Montevideo between 1751 and 1814 were: * Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Viana (1751‚Äì1764) * Agust√≠n de la Rosa (1764‚Äì1771) * Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Viana (1771‚Äì1773) * Joaqu√≠n del Pino y Rozas (1773‚Äì1790) * Antonio de Olaguer y Feli√∫ (1790‚Äì1797) * Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra (1797‚Äì1804) * Pascual Ruiz Huidobro (1804‚Äì1807) On February 3, 1807, British forces occupied Montevideo, deposing and taking prisoner Governor Ruiz Huidobro. The British held the city until September 9, 1807, when it was recaptured by Spain. The office of Governor was subsequently reestablished: * Francisco Javier de El√≠o (1807‚Äì1810) * Joaqu√≠n de Soria (April to October 1810) * Gaspar de Vigodet (spelled \\"Bigod√©\\" in contemporary documents) (1810‚Äì1814) =United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata governors= On June 23, 1814, Argentine and Uruguayan troops under the command of Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear entered Montevideo, ending Spanish colonial control of the city. The Supreme Directorate of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata, the revolutionary government of the R√≠o de la Plata, maintained the office of governor of Montevideo, designating its successors: * Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a (July to August, 1814) * Miguel Estanislao Soler (August, 1814 to February, 1815) On February 25, 1815, Argentine troops abandoned Montevideo to the forces of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, who designated two delegate governors during his rule of Uruguay. These were the last two officials to hold the title: * Fernando Otorgu√©s (February to July, 1815) * Miguel Barreiro (July, 1815 to January, 1817) The office came to an end with the second Portuguese invasion of Uruguay in July 1816.

Documents published by Municode include the original codification, recodification, or republication of municipal legislation (i.e. Codes of Ordinances, Land Use Codes, and Charters), and the updating and supplementation of municipal legislation through printed looseleaf pages and various electronic formats. In 2016, Municode acquired the Oregon-based government website content management provider Aha Consulting, Inc. In addition to legal codification and website design and hosting, Municode offers electronic payment and traditional bill print services.  Codification  The company's Code Department publishes Codes of Ordinances, which requires the original codification, recodification, or republication of a local government's local legislation. Staff attorneys within this department (also known as \\"code attorneys\\") have the overall responsibility of supervising each publication project. A code attorney reviews the local legislation, organizes the individual pieces of legislation into logical classifications, and then performs a legal review of that legislation, involving an analysis of the legislation compared to state statutes, court decisions, and constitutional principles. The code attorney points out any inconsistencies between the municipality's legislation and the statutes or case law, and makes recommendations to the municipal attorney regarding how to cure any defects found in the local legislation. When the new language is approved by the municipality, the code attorney releases the project to a team of indexer, editors and proofreaders. The company also has full printing and binding capabilities in-house. The MCC Online Library contains a publicly accessible collection of more than 2700 Codes of Ordinances that the company has published for local governments in 50 states. The collection of Codes of Ordinances available are integrated with a search engine, and include various research tools that make it a valuable repository of local laws.

The station is on CSX Transportation's New River Line and is located on the east bank of the New River. It is one of Amtrak's least-busy stations, it was the second least-busy for fiscal year 2006, after Greenfield Village, Michigan, which was less traveled because it had been discontinued from the Amtrak regular schedule in April 2006 (being open only to groups after that point). Of the 509 stations served by Amtrak in fiscal year 2012, Thurmond was again the second least-used station, just ahead of Sanderson, Texas. The long, narrow two-story slate-roofed wooden structure, built in 1905 by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, also houses a railroad museum and a visitor center for the New River Gorge National River. The depot features a projecting bay that served as a signal tower. The interior originally possessed three waiting rooms: one for white men, one for white women, and one for African Americans.

History Although the first major housing developments around Hateley Heath took place in the Heath Lane area during 1930s when private builders built houses within the boundary of West Bromwich, the largest section of Hateley Heath was developed during the late 1940s and early 1950s within the boundaries of West Bromwich and neighbouring Wednesbury, when mass council house building took place. The new homes were initially very popular with their occupants, who appreciated modern facilities such as indoor toilets, bathrooms, running water, electricity and gardens. They had previously lived in 19th century slums which lacked these facilities. An infant school was built to serve the estate in 1950, replacing facilities at nearby Hill Top, followed by the junior school two years later. The infant and junior schools merged to form a single primary school in September 1999. The senior school at Hill Top remained open and was the most popular destination for the secondary school population of the estate until its closure in the early 1990s, since when nearby Wodensborough has been the main secondary school for pupils living in Hateley Heath. In 1966, Wednesbury urban district was absorbed into an expanded West Bromwich borough and Hateley Heath was fully incorporated into the township of West Bromwich, within which it has remained ever since. The opposite transfer of township took place with neighbouring Friar Park, which was now within the township of Wednesbury rather than West Bromwich. By the 1980s, Hateley Heath was plagued by high unemployment and crime, and the condition of the housing was declining, although subsequent refurbishment projects saw the standard of housing improve. A small section of the estate, consisting of low-rise flats, was demolished between 1988 and 1992, and new housing was built in its place by both the public sector and private sector. In January 1992, an Express & Star report claimed that Hateley Heath had some of the worst crime rates in the region.midlandsmemories.com It was estimated that six out of ten children living in Hateley Heath were involved in crime. Joyriding, burglaries, theft and vandalism were just some of the many problems that were reported to be plaguing the area. Several shopkeepers had closed their stores due to extensive theft and vandalism. In 1991 alone, no less than 1,006 crimes were recorded on the estate - an average of once in just over eight hours. Car thefts and break-ins were the most common crime in the area, followed closely behind by burglaries and vandalism. During the year, 48 people who lived on the estate were arrested on suspicion of various criminal offences, though it is unknown how many of these arrests resulted in a conviction. What is known is that all but three of the people arrested were aged under 25. Unemployment and social deprivation were blamed for the decline of Hateley Heath, with an unemployment rate of 14.9% in 1991, when the national rate was below 10%. However, parts of the nearby towns of Smethwick and Tipton had an even higher unemployment rate at this time, when Britain was in recession. Hateley Heath has since improved with the aid of local community projects. Private housing was built on the site of the demolished flats. Most of the remaining homes have been comprehensively refurbished, while a small section of the northern part of the estate was demolished in the early 2010s. Facilities The estate has been served by an infant school since 1950 and a junior school since 1952. Both of these schools replaced facilities at nearby Hill Top School, which remained open as a secondary school until 1992 and is now the site of a housing development. A second primary school, Kent Close Primary, was opened on the estate in 1960 to serve the growing 5-11 population. It closed in July 2005 and was later demolished.

All subjects are taught in French, except English and Spanish. According to the Fraser Institute Report Card on Alberta's Secondary and Elementary Schools 2019, CFIS achieved a top ranking of schools in Alberta. It is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Associated School, as well as Round Square affiliated, and it is accredited by the Canadian Accredited Independent Schools. The $20 million dollar 120,000 square foot school facility was built in two phases, in 2003 and 2005. The two-story school facility includes 45 classrooms, two library/resource areas, two science labs, dedicated music rooms, dedicated art studios, an outdoor classroom, double-court regulation gyms, a junior-sized baseball diamond, a running track and soccer pitch, and two theatre-style classrooms.  History  The Calgary French School (the predecessor to the Calgary French and International School) was founded after the passing of the Official Languages Act in September of 1969. Many mothers had practiced french on their own, and sought to establish an educational institution that could teach young in an all-French environment, called French immersion. Calgary French School began in church basements, and became a part of the Sacred Heart School in 1974. Throughout this time there was consistent growth in both student numbers and scholarly reputation. Over time, the community desired a space to call home. In late 1999, the shared space was reclaimed by its owners, so the school sought its own building. A campaign began to raise funds to purchase land and to construct a new site for the growing school.

It carried a 250 kiloton thermonuclear warhead configured as a nuclear depth bomb.Dr Peter A Goetz A Technical History of America's Nuclear Arms,, 2018, Vol 1 p419. Development Subroc launch sequence, 1964. Subroc in Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center SUBROC was one of several weapons recommended for implementation by Project Nobska, a 1956 summer study on submarine warfare. Development began in 1958, with the technical evaluation being completed in 1963. SUBROC reached Initial Operation Capability (IOC) aboard the attack submarine Permit in 1964.SUBROC was originally supposed to reach IOC with the attack submarine , but that submarine sank before any missiles were loaded and tested on it. When SUBROC reached IOC, the US Navy's admiral in charge of weapons procurement stated that SUBROC was \\" .. a more difficult technical problem than Polaris.\\" Bill Gunston Rocket & Missiles, Salamander Books Ltd 1979, ISSB 0-517-26870-1 Operation SUBROC could be launched from a 21-inch submarine torpedo tube. After launch, the solid fuel rocket motor fired and SUBROC rose to the surface. The launch angle then changed and SUBROC flew to its destination following a predetermined ballistic trajectory. At a predetermined time in the trajectory, the reentry vehicle (containing the warhead) separated from the solid fuel motor. The 250 kiloton W55 nuclear depth bomb, dropped into the water and sank rapidly to detonate near its target. A direct hit was not necessary. The W55 was in diameter, long, and weighed . Some sources suggest the W55 evolved from the experimental bomb tested in the Hardtack I Olive nuclear test on July 22, 1958, which had a full two-stage yield estimated at 202 kilotons. Researcher Chuck Hansen claims based on his US nuclear program research that the W55 and W58 warheads shared a common primary or fission first stage, and that this design was nicknamed the Kinglet primary by Hansen in 2001.Beware the old story by Chuck Hansen, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, March/April 2001 pp. 52-55. SUBROC's tactical use was as an urgent-attack long-range weapon for time-urgent submarine targets that could not be attacked with any other weapon without betraying the position of the launching submarine by calling for an air-strike, or where the target was too distant to be attacked quickly with a torpedo launched from the submarine. The tactical rationale for SUBROC was similar to that for ASROC or Ikara. An added advantage was that SUBROC's approach to the target was not detectable by the target in time to take evasive action, although the warhead yield would appear to make evasive maneuvers unrealistic. However, SUBROC was less flexible in its use than Ikara or ASROC: since its only payload was a nuclear warhead, it could not be used to provide stand-off fire in a conventional (i.e., non- nuclear) engagement. SUBROC production ended in 1968. SUBROC was never used in combat, and all 285 W55 warheads were decommissioned in 1990 following the end of the Cold War. Because the nuclear warhead was an integral part of the weapon, SUBROC could not be exported to other navies, and there is no evidence that any were supplied to other NATO allies under the well-established arrangements for supplying other dual-key nuclear weapons. In 1980 a planned successor, the UUM-125 Sea Lance, was authorized. In 1982 the contract was awarded to Boeing. The system and its W89 warhead were cancelled in 1990 at the end of the Cold War.

The album was released in 1982 by the short-lived record label Vissi and Nikos Karvelas formed for the release known as CarVi, whose name is a combination of their last names. At the time, Vissi was still signed to the Greek division of the EMI-owned Columbia Records, which went against her contract releasing an album with a different label. The independent production and release was a result of unresolved differences under her then signing. A court order in favor of EMIAL - the Greek division of EMI and the parent company of the Greek division of Columbia Records - resulted in the withdrawal of the album only a few weeks after its release, making the album a collectible item. It is also the first album to be entirely written, composed and produced by Karvelas made for Vissi and kicks off a long collaboration. The album is considered by fans to be a raw and authentic composition for both Vissi and Karvelas, completely unburdened by any influence or control by a multinational record label. The songs of the album appeared on compact disc for the first time in 2019 with the Panik Gold box set The Legendary Recordings 1982-2019.

This enzyme belongs to the family of cytochrome P450 isomerases.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. However, this protein is considered a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily on the basis of sequence similarity rather than functional similarity. This endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. An imbalance of prostacyclin and its physiological antagonist thromboxane A2 contribute to the development of myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis. Unlike most P450 enzymes, PGIS does not require molecular oxygen (O2). Instead it uses its heme cofactor to catalyze the isomerization of prostaglandin H2 to prostacyclin. Prostaglandin H2 is produced by cyclooxygenase in the first committed step of prostaglandin biosynthesis.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,11alpha-epidioxy-15-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate 6-isomerase.

Vinh Moc (Vƒ©nh M·ªëc) is a tunnel complex in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Vietnam. During the Vietnam War it was strategically located on the border of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The tunnels were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province in the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. The American forces believed the villagers of Vinh Moc were supplying food and armaments to the North Vietnamese garrison on the island of Con Co which was in turn hindering the American bombers on their way to bomb Hanoi. The idea was to force the villagers of Vinh Moc to leave the area but as is typical in Vietnam there was nowhere else to go. The villagers initially dug the tunnels to move their village 10 metres underground but the American forces designed bombs that burrowed down 10 metres. Eventually, against these odds, the villagers moved the village to a depth of 30 metres. It was constructed in several stages beginning in 1966 and used until early 1972. The complex grew to include wells, kitchens, rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare. Around sixty families lived in the tunnels; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels. The tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives. The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode; the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft. Three levels of tunnels were eventually built.  Geography  The tunnels lie north of the B·∫øn H·∫£i River. Much of the sub-strata of Vietnam is limestone which is soft to dig through yet structurally sound. The limestone allows easy hand digging of the tunnels and no structural supports are necessary.  History  When the War took place in Vinh Moc from 1966 to 1972, the United States Army released over 9,000 tons of bombs in the area, with a ratio of 7 tons of bombs on average per person. The locals began to dig tunnels in 1965 and finished in 1967 with simple tools in 18,000 labor days. The total length of the tunnels is nearly 2,000 m long with six entrances to the tops of hills and seven entrances to the South China sea. Tourism Today, the tunnels are a tourist attraction and can be visited on organised tours. Beside individual tours to the tunnels, they are regularly part of day trips, starting from Hu√© to explore the DMZ. In comparison to the C·ªß Chi tunnels further south, walking through the Vinh Moc tunnels is a lot more comfortable, because they are situated in a less humid climate zone, and the height of the tunnels allows visitors to stand upright.

Born on 26 September in Gort, County Galway, Commins first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Galway minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1986 championship. Commins went on to play a key role for Galway for the next few years, and won two All-Ireland medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team at various times, Commins won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a one-time Connacht medallist with Gort. In addition to this he also won one championship medal. Commins's retirement came following the conclusion of the 1990 championship. Commins is married and has three children, who all play hurling. Early life John Commins was born in Gort, County Galway in 1965. From a young age he showed great interest in the game of hurling and, in time, he would become a key member of the great Galway team of the 1980s. Playing career =Club= Commins played his club hurling with his local Gort club. He had some success at underage levels. He won a Senior County championship medal in 1983, and won the Connaught club medal the same year. =Inter-county= Commins first came to prominence as an inter-county hurler on Galway's minor team in the early 1980s. He won an All-Ireland medal in 1983http://www.gortgaa.com/uploads/2/5/1/3/2513401/hurling_in_gort.doc and quickly graduated onto the under-21 side where he won another All-Ireland medal in 1986. That same year Commins made his debut as goalkeeper on the senior hurling team, with Galway reaching their second consecutive All-Ireland final. In the game against Cork Commins ran the length of the pitch to score a 21-yard free, however, victory still went to the Munster champions. In 1987, in their third All-Ireland final appearance in-a-row, Galway took on Kilkenny. At the third time of asking Galway emerged victorious and Commins finally captured his first All-Ireland medal. In 1988 Tipperary were Galway's opponents in their fourth consecutive All-Ireland final appearance. Commins had another solid performance as goalkeeper and claimed his second All-Ireland title in the process, before later winning his first All-Star award. In 1989 Commins began the year by winning his first National Hurling League title, however, Galway's star centre-back, Tony Keady, was banned from playing for a year. The side had contemplated withdrawing from the championship in protest, however, they decided to play, eventually losing out to Tipp in the All- Ireland semi-final.Commins received \\"man of the match\\" for this performance. In 1990 Commins played in his fourth All-Ireland final in five seasons. Galway were the hot favourites to beat Cork and it looked as if that prediction would come true when the tribesmen went 7 points up. Cork scored 4 goals in the second half and Commins was the scapegoat for the 5-15 to 2-21 defeat and was dropped from the Galway team for the 1991 championship. At the age of just 25 years Commins‚Äôs inter-county hurling career had drawn to a close.

It is the only film directed by Robert Dalva. It was produced by Francis Ford Coppola for MGM/UA Entertainment Company. The film stars Kelly Reno, Vincent Spano and Teri Garr. The portrayal of The Black was shared between Cass Ole, the horse from The Black Stallion, and El Mokhtar. Plot The story begins with several odd occurrences at the farm where the Black, Alec (Kelly Reno), and his mother (Teri Garr) live. A suspicious barn fire is followed by the theft of the horse. From the point of view of Ishak (Ferdy Mayne), the sheik who took him, this is property retrieval; the horse was originally his, and the Black's name is Shetan. Although he learns that the horse is being returned to the sheik's kingdom in the Moroccan desert, Alec goes after the sheik, stowing away in a plane to Casablanca. In Morocco, after being found on the plane, Alec is taken to the American embassy, where the police plan on sending him home. At the stables, he makes some friends who disguise him as a local Casablancan. They take him to a man named Kurr (Allen Garfield) the leader of a rogue tribe called the Uruk, who is very interested in the horse and the sheik, and allows Alec to go with him and his companion. But after getting a flat tire, they abandon Alec in the desert. He is found by the driver of another truck and given a ride. Aboard the truck, he meets Raj (Vincent Spano), who tells him the Black will probably compete in \\"The Great Race.\\" The two become friends and travel across the desert on foot with Meslar (Woody Strode), Raj's friend and mentor. Then the Uruk kidnap Meslar, and Raj and Alec defend themselves against the harsh elements. After running out of water, they collapse from dehydration but recover when they find a river. Raj's tribe discovers them, welcoming Raj home and Alec to the tribe. Raj takes Alec to the outskirts of Ishak's home, and he reunites with the Black. While attempting to retrieve the horse, Alec is apprehended by Ishak's men. He pleads his case to Ishak, who is sympathetic but will not give up the horse. He plans to race the Black in the \\"Great Race\\" with his granddaughter Tabari (Jodi Thelen) as jockey. Alec insists the Black can win the race only if he, not Tabari, rides him. Denied the position, he coaches Tabari on riding the horse, but the Black throws her off. Then, the Uruk led by Kurr then captures the Black and Alec and takes them away. Later, Alec escapes with the Black. As they flee, Alec discovers that Meslar is alive and being held prisoner. He gives Meslar his pocket knife to help him get free of his bonds. Alec and the Black escape and go back to Ishak's home. As a reward for the safe return of the horse, Alec is allowed to ride him in the race. On the day of the race, Alec reunites with Raj, who is also competing, and they begin their run across the desert along with the other riders. The Uruk's rider tries to kill Alec, but he and the Black escape. Alec discovers that the Uruk's rider pushed Raj off his horse, and he brings Raj's mount back to him. They race against the Uruk rider until Meslar appears and spooks the rider's horse, unseating him. Suddenly, Kurr shows up in his truck and chases Raj and Alec, shooting at them. However, he takes a wrong turn and the truck crashes into a ditch. Alec wins the race, then pleads with Ishak to allow Raj to keep the horse that he rode, despite the condition that the winning rider's sheik is allowed to keep any horses that he wants. Ishak grants the reprieve, which allows Alec to repay Raj for his kindness. Meslar returns with Kurr, his riding companion, and the Uruk rider as his prisoners, and they are taken to face judgement. Although Ishak gives the Black back to Alec, he decides to leave him in Morocco, where he feels he is more at home.

It has a kind of comicbook appreciation for direct action and no time whatsoever for mysticism or for scenery for its own sake, though most of it was shot in Morocco and is fun to look at.\\" The Boston Globe called it a \\"slow-paced, incompetently directed film with both eyes focused on the box office.\\" Variety magazine said, \\"The Black Stallion Returns is little more than a contrived, cornball story that most audiences will find to be an interminable bore.\\" Roger Ebert complained about the film's stereotypical portrayal of Arab characters in his review, while noting that Allen Garfield was miscast.

The Cardinal operates as Train 50 Eastbound towards Washington D.C. and New York City departing Chicago on Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. The train operates as Train 51 Westbound towards Chicago departing New York on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Trains only operate to the station on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Description The station was originally owned by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. In September 2010, the station was purchased by General Corporation, a commercial real estate company based in Charleston. The station is located on the south bank of the Kanawha River, opposite downtown Charleston which lies on the north bank. Much of the station's outdoor space is covered by the South Side Bridge which allows both vehicular and pedestrian traffic to access the downtown areas. A fine dining establishment, Laury's Restaurant, occupies much of the station's interior. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as the Chesapeake and Ohio Depot and part of the South Hills Multiple Resource Area. It is a two-story, brick and stone structure in the Neo-Classical Revival style. The facade features a shallow pavilion of paired Roman Doric columns facing the Kanawha River. It also has a low hipped, tile-covered roof with bracketed deep eaves. Since budget cuts in 2018, the Charleston station is no longer staffed by an Amtrak station agent. Since no ticket agent is available, tickets to and from Charleston must be purchased in advance; there are also no Quik-Trak kiosks available. The station does, however, provide self-serve checked baggage service; passengers tag their own bags and take them to the conductor trainside.Charleston, WV (CHW) (Amtrak's Great American Stations) See also * List of Amtrak stations * National Register of Historic Places listings in Kanawha County, West Virginia References External links * Charleston, WV (CHW) (Amtrak's Great American Stations) * Charleston Amtrak Station (USA Rail Guide -- Train Web) * National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form * General Corporation * Laury's Restaurant Category:Amtrak stations in West Virginia Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in West Virginia Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1905 Category:Buildings and structures in Charleston, West Virginia Category:Neoclassical architecture in West Virginia Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway stations Category:Transportation in Kanawha County, West Virginia ","title":"Charleston station (West Virginia)"},{"id":"9922322","text":"Stephen James Foley (born November 11, 1953 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is a former American football safety in the National Football League.

Twenty years later on December 29, 1989, the Orange County Cooperative Library System was converted into a California Library Services Act agency and renamed the Santiago Library System. The SLS was a cooperative arrangement designed to maximize resources by providing programs and services jointly where it is mutually beneficial to the local population. An important SLS role was facilitating the sharing of local collections by providing delivery of materials among the nine member libraries. The System enhanced the reference capabilities of these libraries by furnishing additional resources and expertise when needed to meet patrons' requests. SLS presented workshops, arranged staff training programs, and aided in the development of additional reference tools and services. =Dissolution= On July 1, 2009, SLS and the Metropolitan Cooperative Library System (MCLS) of Los Angeles County were combined and renamed the Southern California Library Cooperative (SCLC).

Located at 1050 8th Avenue, the station consists of a platform on the south side of the east- west tracks, a small parking lot, and a small building in between. The station contains a waiting room and space for a ticket office, though Amtrak pulled the station agent in the 21st century. Huntington is served by the Cardinal route. The Amtrak station replaced a Chesapeake and Ohio station on 7th Avenue. The one story building was constructed to a standard design that Amtrak developed in the 1970s and used at locations throughout the country for the next two decades. Typical features included at Huntington are concrete block walls, floor to ceiling windows and a black, cantilevered roof. Transit connections The Huntington station is located six blocks south and two blocks west of the Tri-State Transit Authority Transit Center. Most TTA bus routes and the Greyhound Bus stop at that station. For closer connections, riders can take advantage of TTA Routes 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, which pass two blocks of the station at 4th Avenue. Those connections are not always practical under current Cardinal schedule. The passengers who arrive on the eastbound train from Chicago can easily transfer to any route that serves the Transit Center, most bus routes don't start running until the train departs. Except for the few PM routes, most TTA routes stop running hours before the westbound train arrives, limiting options for any passengers who are either boarding or disembarking from the train.

Nixon used in a speech on January 23, 1973 to describe the Paris Peace Accords to end the Vietnam War. The phrase is a variation on a campaign promise Nixon made in 1968: \\"I pledge to you that we shall have an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.\\" The Accords specified that a ceasefire would take place four days later. According to the plan, within sixty days of the ceasefire, the North Vietnamese would release all U.S. prisoners, and all U.S. troops would withdraw from South Vietnam. On March 29, 1973, the last U.S. soldier left Vietnam. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell to North Vietnamese troops.Gilbert Morales, Critical Perspectives on the Vietnam War, p. 120-125, 2005, , Closely connected with the phrase is the idea that Nixon claimed in 1968 to have a secret plan to end the war. Nixon never made such a claim during his campaign, but neither did he explain how he would achieve peace. Therefore the assumption that he had a secret plan became a widespread belief and is commonly misattributed as a direct quote.

He struggled in that role and was demoted to the bottom third of the order. However, after Jeter was put on the disabled list for a calf injury, Gardner was returned to the top of the order, alternating with Nick Swisher. After Jeter's return and Alex Rodriguez's stint on the DL for knee surgery, Gardner and Jeter periodically shared the top of the order, with Gardner at lead-off and Jeter batting second.

The home run sealed a 5‚Äì4 victory for the Yankees, and helped give support to a struggling Mariano Rivera, who blew three consecutive save opportunities for the only time in his career. In the same series against Detroit two days earlier, Gardner made his first bailout of Rivera's pitching mishap by hitting a walk-off single past a diving Miguel Cabrera to give the Yankees a 4‚Äì3 win. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Gardner became the first Yankee since Claudell Washington in 1988 to have two walk-off hits in a span of three or fewer games.

He was one of the five candidates chosen for the All-Star Final Vote for the 2015 MLB All-Star Game, but was later removed from the ballot after being chosen to replace the injured Alex Gordon on the All- Star team. Gardner's hot first half would not last the whole season; after batting .302 up to the All-Star break, he struggled for the rest of the year, hitting .206 in the second half of the season.

He was listed as a Gold Glove finalist, but ultimately lost to Alex Gordon of the Kansas City Royals. 2018 Gardner entered the 2018 season as a member of a crowded outfield. However, due to injuries to Jacoby Ellsbury, (who missed the entire 2018 season with various ailments), Clint Frazier, who suffered a concussion in spring training that sidelined him for most of the season, and Aaron Judge (who missed two months with a wrist injury), Gardner saw more playing time than originally expected, appearing in 140 games. He finished the season batting .236 (his worst average since 2008), with 12 home runs and 45 RBIs. On October 31, 2018, the Yankees announced they had declined his $12.5 million option for 2019, and instead re- signed him to a one-year, $7.5 million contract for the 2019 season. 2019 On April 17, 2019, Gardner hit his 100th career home run‚Äîa grand slam off Ryan Brasier‚Äîto give the Yankees a go-ahead 5‚Äì3 lead over the Boston Red Sox in what would be the game-deciding hit.

Player profile Gardner is considered one of the fastest players in Major League Baseball. He is best known for stealing bases and being very disciplined at the plate. He makes contact with 93% of his swings, third best in the American League. In 2010 and 2014, Gardner saw more pitches per at-bat than any other player in the American League. As a home run hitter, he has only hit 3 opposite-field (left field) home runs (one inside-the-park run) in his career one each in the old and current Yankee Stadium. Personal life Brett and his wife, Jessica, have two sons together. In the offseason, the Gardners reside in Holly Hill, South Carolina.
