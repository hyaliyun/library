A lifelong professional soldier, he served his country as a junior officer in World War I, a staff officer in the inter-war period and a brigade-level commander during World War II. Biography Born on 12 August 1892 in Metz, Ludwig Bieringer joined the German Army straight from school in 1913. During the First World War, he was an Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant). Bieringer served mainly in the 8th Train-Battalion. Bieringer was promoted to Major in 1934, and served as Staff-Officer of Transport Troops, with the Staff of the 7th Division. He was promoted to Commander of the 7th Motor-Transport- Battalion in October 1935, before being promoted to Course-Director at the Army Supply School, in 1937. As Army Supply Leader at the beginning of the Second World War, Bieringer assumed command of the Outpost of the General- Quartermaster, with the Army Group South, in June 1942, and then with the Army Group A. Bieringer was promoted to the grade of Generalmajor in July 1943. Bieringer was in charge of the supply of the troops, this time in Italy, from June to September 1943. From September 1943 to April 1944, he was detached as Field Commander assistant to the Feld Kommandantur of Besan√ßon. Bieringer was eventually nominated Feld Kommandeur in Draguignan (Feld Kommandantur 800). Captured in August 1944, Bieringer was released in May 1947. Bieringer died on 22 January 1975, in Hanover.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It stands in an isolated position in a field some from a minor road. History The size of the surrounding churchyard and the presence within the structure of the church of a stone dating from the 5th or 6th century is evidence that an earlier church or churches stood on the site. It is traditionally credited to its namesake, the 7th-century saint Baglan ap Dingad. The present church dates probably from the 13th century. The chancel was rebuilt in about 1800, when the north porch was also added. Unusually, the church escaped restoration during the Victorian era, and so its interior is still little changed since about 1800. Describing the reasons for its Grade I listing, Cadw states it is \\"a rare example of a medieval church unrestored in the 19th century, so retaining an exceptionally complete set of 18th-century furnishings\\". It also comments on its \\"outstanding isolated setting.\\" After it was declared redundant, the church was vested in the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1991, and the charity has held the freehold since 7 February 1991. It has since been repaired, aided by financial help from Cadw. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel under a single roof, a south transept acting as a chapel, and a north porch. On the west gable is a bellcote, and on the chancel gable is a weathered cross. There are no windows in the nave, and the chancel has only a two-light east window. In the south and east walls of the transept are small two-light windows. Over the doorway is a lintel consisting of a 6th- century inscribed stone. Internally, the walls are plastered and whitewashed; the roof timbers are also whitewashed. The floor is paved with slate slabs. There is no division between the nave and the chancel, and the transept is fully open to the body of the church. The east window dates from the 14th century and was resited when the chancel was rebuilt. =Interior= Cadw describes the set of mid- and later 18th-century furniture as being \\"exceptional\\". The oak altar is enclosed by communion rails on three sides; the rails are supported by slender balusters and on the corner posts are finials. In the southwest corner of the chancel is an oak pulpit and a reading desk over which is a sounding board. The seating in the nave, chancel and transept consists of box pews and benches, some of which are inscribed with initials and dates. The font dates from the 13th or 14th century and consists of a heptagonal gritstone bowl on a heptagonal shaft. On the walls of the church are slate memorial tablets. The bell is dated 1790, and was re-fitted in 2003. An early 19th-century brass candelabrum, a chalice dated 1723, and a silver salver of 1752 which were formerly in the church are now in the care of Bangor Cathedral. External features St Baglan's church, lychgate Adjacent to the church is a field in which Baglan's well was sited. This was a structure containing seats, and it was said to have healing powers. It was filled in during the 19th century. The church is now approached through a lychgate dated 1722. Notable interments On 20 January 2017, the church was the venue for the funeral of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. He was buried in the churchyard where the family has a plot.

Plot As he and Glimpy Freedhoff (Huntz Hall) anxiously anticipate their furlough home, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) is summoned to the colonel (Bryant Washburn)'s office and informed that he is to be honorably discharged because of poor eyesight. At home in the Bowery, Muggs is tearfully telling his proud mother (Mary Gordon) about his discharge when Glimpy bursts into the apartment with the news that Danny (Dave Durand) has been jailed. Determined to exonerate their friend, Muggs and Glimpy proceed to the clubhouse and are welcomed by their pals. There they meet Spider (Billy Benedict), a new club member who was working with Danny at a warehouse when he was arrested. Muggs and Glimpy then go to the jailhouse to question Danny. Becoming suspicious when Danny tells them that soon after Spider arranged for him to work at the warehouse, he was charged with stealing alcohol earmarked for the Army, Muggs goes to the warehouse to investigate. After observing Fingers Belmont (Gabriel Dell), a troublemaker who had been expelled from their club, hand fifty dollars to Spider, Muggs invites Spider to a \\"party\\" at the clubhouse that night. When Spider arrives, Muggs orders the other boys to leave the room. Claiming that he was dishonorably discharged, Muggs then tells Spider that he wants to join the hijackers, and Spider confides that Fingers pays him to unbolt the back door to the warehouse. As Muggs and Spider leave the clubhouse for the night, Spider admits to Muggs that the only reason he took up the job with the crooks was in order to have money to take care of his ill mother. Meanwhile, Fingers had overheard Spider's earlier confession and, once Spider is alone, drags him back to the clubhouse and beats him to death. When Spider's body is found there, suspicion falls on Muggs, and Glimpy hurries to warn his friend that the police are looking for him. Determined to clear his name and expose the mastermind behind the hijackers, Muggs approaches Major Kline of military intelligence and offers to work undercover to solve the case. Meanwhile, Fingers' boss Larry (Jack La Rue), the owner of Maxie's Club, becomes disturbed when he reads about Spider's murder in the newspaper. Major Kline then introduces Muggs to Captain Baker of the police department, and when the two law enforcement officials decide to accept his proposal, Muggs finds Fingers and threatens to expose him to the police unless he is allowed to join the hijackers. After Fingers directs Muggs to meet him at Maxie's Club the next evening, Muggs convenes a meeting of the club members. Appealing to the boys for help in apprehending the thieves, Muggs instructs Glimpy to wait for his phone call at Ginsberg (Bernard Gorcey)'s delicatessen the next evening and then assemble the other members. When one of the boys finds a bloodied tie clip on the floor bearing the initials \\"WWB,\\" Muggs realizes that it must belong to Spider's killer. At Maxie's the next night, Muggs asks his sister Milly (Joan Marsh), who works as a cigarette girl there, to phone Ginsberg's delicatessen if anything strange happens. As the boys await Muggs's call, Fingers and Muggs row out to a warehouse on the docks and load some stolen crates onto their boat. After delivering the crates to Maxie's storeroom, Muggs starts an argument with Fingers and knocks him unconscious. In the fray, Finger's hat flies off his head and Muggs sees the initials \\"WWB\\" inscribed on the band. Upon regaining consciousness, Fingers knocks Muggs down and races to warn Larry about Muggs's double-cross. Overhearing their conversation, Milly notifies Glimpy at the delicatessen and Glimpy then rallies the boys waiting at the clubhouse. After Fingers returns to the storehouse, Milly enters Larry's office and begins to flirt with him, stalling for time. When Glimpy and the others burst into Maxie's storeroom, Fingers rushes back to Larry's office and there recognizes Milly as Muggs's sister. At that moment, Muggs and the boys come to Milly's rescue and apprehend Larry and Fingers. For their heroism, Muggs is reinstated into the Army as a sergeant and Glimpy is promoted to the rank of corporal.

Although its headquarters is in Zurich, DKSH is deeply rooted in communities all across the Asia Pacific region. The company offers any combination of sourcing, marketing, sales, distribution and after-sales-services and is organized into four Business Units: Consumer Goods (including the Business Segment Luxury & Lifestyle), Healthcare, Performance Materials and Technology. Its core business is supporting other companies to grow their business in new or existing markets. With 850 business locations in 36 countries and 33,350 specialized staff, it is one of the top 30 Swiss companies ranked by sales and employees. In 2019, DKSH generated annual net sales of CHF 11.6 billion. Organizational background The company has its origin in the activities of three Swiss entrepreneurs who sailed in the 1860s east to Asia. Independently and within a few years of each other, Wilhelm Heinrich Diethelm set off for Singapore, Eduard Anton Keller for the Philippines, and Hermann Siber for Yokohama. As the oldest of the original companies, Siber & Brennwald was founded in 1865. In 1868, Eduard Anton Keller joined C. Lutz & Co., which was founded in Manila in 1866, and renamed this existing enterprise Ed. A. Keller & Co. after he acquired it a year later in 1887. In a similar manner, in 1871 Wilhelm Heinrich Diethelm joined Hooglandt & Co., established in 1860 in Singapore. Sixteen years later, in 1887, he acquired this company and renamed it as Diethelm & Co. Ltd. The three ancestral companies expanded their business primarily in Asia. Although the European market played a subsidiary role, each headquarters was situated in Switzerland, which illustrates the intensive contact to the home country. Established in 1906 on the banks of Chao Phraya River, today the company is one of Thailand's leading business organizations, with annual sales of THB 123 billion in 2019. DKSH Thailand has close to 12,000 employees and a comprehensive network of branches across Thailand.Facts-and-figures for DKSH Thailand It generates more than a third of overall revenues for DKSH. In 1931 Diethelm & Co., Ltd. was granted permission by Royal Warrant to display the royal Garuda emblem, the official seal of the Royal Household of Thailand. Even though the two families Diethelm and Keller always had a close-knit business and private relationship the two companies finally merged during the 2000 summer into Diethelm Keller Holding. Two years later, in 2002, Siber Hegner joined as well and this resulted in establishing DKSH. DKSH went public in March 2012 on the SIX Swiss Exchange. In 2015, the company celebrated its 150th anniversary. In March 2017 Stefan P. Butz became DKSH's new CEO, with former CEO, Dr. Joerg Wolle, replacing Adrian T. Keller as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In October 2017, DKSH acquired 60 percent of shares in PT Wicaksana which provided the basis for DKSH‚Äôs market entry in Indonesia for Business Units Consumer Goods and Healthcare. Media Release DKSH, October 30, 2017 In October 2018, DKSH announced that in March 2019 Wolle would be resigning his position as Chairman after just two years. Adrian T. Keller became Chairman instead of Wolle. In order to strengthen the Consumer Goods Business Unit, the corresponding business of Auric Pacific in Malaysia and Singapore was acquired for CHF 160 million on April 1, 2019. Revenue of the acquired business is approx. CHF 185 million. This represents the most important acquisition by DKSH since 2002. With several acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand between 2018 and 2020, DKSH has strengthened both the services portfolio as well as its geographical market coverage in the Pacific region.

Landmarks  =St. Giles's Church= The church dedicated to St. Giles () in Koƒçno was first mentioned in 1545. It is a typical example of a fortified church surrounded by walls, dominating the surrounding area. The church was erected when intense building of chapels of ease started. Later, it was renovated several times. It is a single-nave church with a bell tower in front of the entrance. The exterior is simple. The high altar with colonnade architecture is typically Baroque. The church contains works by Mihael Pogaƒçnik, Franc Zemlik, and Jo≈æef Straub from the first half of the 18th century. =Slamnik Hayrack= The Slamnik Hayrack is an example of a double hayrack, which is very rare for this part of Slovenia. The hayrack is an oak structure covered with red brick. It was built in 1884 by carpenters from ≈†entjur, who took three months to complete the carpentry and construction work. The structure is covered in wooden latticework. In the past, it was used for drying hay, and today it is used to store farm tools and machinery.

He was a peripatetic artist who worked for various courts in Northern Europe, especially the Danish court, and also resided in Antwerp for a while.Jacob Binck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History As an engraver he is counted as a peripheral member of the Little Masters group. Life Binck was born at Cologne between 1490 and 1504. From the earliest accounts of Binck, we must consider it probable that he was a pupil of D√ºrer, but this is by no means certain, while his early residence in Italy throws a doubt upon the supposition. He is also said to have worked under Marcantonio Raimondi in Rome. One of his largest plates is a rather feeble copy of the very popular Massacre of the Innocents by Raphael. Previous to the year 1546 he was appointed painter to King Christian III of Denmark, whose portrait and that of his wife Queen Dorothea, by him, are said to be at Copenhagen. He was also employed by Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg, who sent him in 1549 to the Netherlands, to erect a monument to the late Princess. Binck now received a fixed annual salary from Albrecht, and moved to K√∂nigsberg with his wife and family. He died in K√∂nigsberg about twenty years later, in 1568 or 1569. Portrait of Gustav I of Sweden, 1542 (possibly a later copy). Now in the Uppsala University's art collection. All his known paintings are portraits. In the Garderobe at K√∂nigsberg are those of 'Prince Albrecht' and his 'First Wife,' and his own portrait is in the Belvedere, Vienna. Binck's pictures are remarkable for correctness of drawing and general artistic taste. His style is very neat, sometimes resembling the works of H. Aldegrever, but his plates evince less mastery in the execution. His drawing is correct, and there is an agreeable taste in the turn of his figures. There has existed considerable confusion respecting the marks of the artists of this period, particularly those whose names commence with a B. The works of this master are generally marked with a cipher, the C meaning Coloniensis. Several other engravers used the initials I. B., one of whom, very skilful indeed, and possessed of much invention, is mistaken by Sandrart for Bink. Works The following are his principal prints: *The Portrait of Jacob Bink, with a cap, a skull in his cloak, and a cup in his right hand.Portrait of Jacobus Binckius at the Courtauld Institute of Art *The Portrait of Lucas Gassel; I. B. 1529. Inscribed Imago ab Jacob Binck ad vivum delineata. *Portrait of Francis I ; Franciscus rex Franciae. *Portrait of Claude, First Queen of Francis I. 1528. *Christiernus II. Danorum Rex. 1525. *Elisabeta Danorum Begina. *Christian III, surrounded by nine shields of arms and six Cupids, is one of his most elaborate and excellent engravings. It is rare, and not in Bartsch's catalogue. *St. Jerome, with the Lion. *Twenty, representing the Divinities; copied after Caralius, who engraved these plates after Il Rosso. *Adam holding the branch of a tree. *Eve, with a branch with two apples. *Lot and his Daughters; circular; marked twice. *David, with the head of Goliath. 1526. Portrait of Christian III of Denmark. *Judith, with the head of Holofernes. *St. Michael vanquishing the Evil Spirit. *The Virgin Mary adoring the Infant Jesus in the manger. *Virgin sitting on a bank. *Saints, various small prints, including SS. Anthony, the Virgin with Catharine and Barbary, Magdalene, George. *The Beheading of St. John. *The Soldier struggling with Death. A fine design. *Many subjects from fable and allegory, including Cupid, Venus, Hercules and Nessus, Pride, Fortune, Justice. *The Massacre of the Innocents; copied after Marc' Antonio; very scarce; an inferior print. *A Woman beating and driving away the Devil with her crutch. 1528. *A Soldier and a young woman. *A Peasant carrying a basket of eggs. *A Peasant and woman dancing. *A Vignette, four Cupids mounted on dolphins. *A Vase, ornamented with the heads of two unicorns. With about fifteen other ornamental trifles. His prints amount in number to 140, but many of them are copies from D√ºrer, Sebald Beham, and others.

Current status South Africa is not individually classified by the OpenNet Initiative, but is included in ONI's regional overview for sub-Saharan Africa.\\"ONI Regional Overview: Sub-Saharan Africa\\", OpenNet Initiative, September 2009 Digital media freedom is generally respected in South Africa. Political content is partially censored, with a number of incidents. The Freedom of the Press Report lists South Africa as being among the countries with one of the biggest declines in press freedom, dropping four places. It is now being seen as only ‚Äúpartly free‚Äù. Thus, suggesting that political content has been to some extent censored by the ANC government. The ANC government introduced two measures that are reminiscent of the apartheid government's diminishing of the media firstly, the ANC government has been contemplating over developing a Media Appeal Tribunal which would have the ability to sanction journalists for 'misconduct' this would suggest that these measures have little to do with protecting the national interest. Secondly, the Protection of State Information Bill, which will supply the government with expansive power to analyse almost any information involving an agent of the state as top secret, not to be reported on by journalists. Therefore political content is partially censored in South Africa.Gumede, W., 2014. \\"South Africa's media and strengthening of democracy\\". However bloggers and content creators are not targeted for their online activities. In 2013 Freedom House rated South Africa's \\"Internet Freedom Status\\" as \\"Free\\".\\"South Africa country report\\", Freedom on the Net, Freedom House, 2013. In 2006, the government of South Africa began prohibiting sites hosted in the country from displaying X18 (explicitly sexual) and XXX content (including child pornography and depictions of violent sexual acts); site owners who refuse to comply are punishable under the Film and Publications Act 1996. In 2007 a South African \\"sex blogger\\" was arrested. Laws and regulations Online media in South Africa is currently regulated under the Films and Publications Act of 1996 as amended. South Africa participates in regional efforts to combat cybercrime. The East African Community (consisting of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Southern African Development Community (consisting of Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) have both enacted plans to standardize cybercrime laws throughout their regions. Under the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002 (ECTA), ISPs are required to respond to and implement take-down notices regarding illegal content such as child pornography, defamatory material, and copyright violations. Members of the Internet Service Providers Association are not liable for third-party content they do not create or select, however, they can lose this protection from liability if they do not respond to take-down requests. ISPs often err on the side of caution by taking down content to avoid litigation since there is no incentive for providers to defend the rights of the original content creator, even if they believe the take-down notice was requested in bad faith. There is no existing appeal mechanism for content creators or providers. During May 2010 the Christian advocacy group Justice Alliance of South Africa (JASA) authored a document titled \\"Internet and Cell Phone Pornography Bill\\". Their document proposes to make it illegal for Internet service providers in South Africa to distribute or permit the distribution of pornography. The document was presented to the Deputy Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. Malusi Gigaba then asked the Law Reform Commission whether a change in the law was possible. In July 2010 Malusi Gigaba then called for the fast-tracking of new regulation that would compel Internet service providers to filter content provided to users to ensure it does not contain any pornography. In September 2012, the Constitutional Court upheld a ruling that prescreening publications (including Internet content) as required by the 2009 amendments to the Films and Publications Act of 1996 was an unconstitutional limitation on freedom of expression. In September 2013 President Jacob Zuma refused to sign the Protection of State Information Bill (POSIB) into law and instead sent it back to the National Assembly for reconsideration. The bill provided for heavy penalties for journalists who reveal \\"State secrets\\", including a prison sentence of up to 25 years for \\"divulging classified information\\". The bill was criticized because of the danger it posed to investigative journalism.\\"President refuses to sign draconian bill into law\\", Reporters Without Borders, 12 September 2013. In November 2013, the Protection of Personal Information Act was signed into law, enacting measures to protect users‚Äô online security, privacy, and data. No law ensuring the constitutional right to privacy existed previous to POPI, which allows an individual to bring civil claims against those who contravene the act. 35 Penalties for contravening the law are stiff, including prison terms and fines of up to ZAR 10 million (over US$900,000).

Its academic program came to include core disciplines such as theology, philosophy, and mathematics, geography, astronomy, and Latin, Portuguese and Chinese, including also a school of music and arts. It had immense influence on the learning of Eastern languages and culture, housing the first western sinologists Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest, among many famous scholars of the time. The College was the base for Jesuit missionaries travelling to China, Japan and East Asia, and developed mingled with a thrifty Macau-Nagasaki trade until 1645. After a revolt blamed on religious influence, Japan expelled the Portuguese and banned Catholicism, and the college became then a shelter for fleeing Christian priests. Jesuits abandoned it in 1762 when they were expelled by the Portuguese authorities, during the suppression of the Society of Jesus. The buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1835. In 2005, the ruins of St. Paul's - notably the facade of the Madre de Deus church - were officially enlisted as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site - Historic Centre of Macau. History Represented (top): Matteo Ricci, Adam Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest Bottom: Paul Siu, colao or Prime Minister of State; Candide Hiu, granddaughter of Colao Paul Siu. Since 1557, Portuguese Macau had been the single center for exchange between China and Japan, and from there to Europe via Goa. In 1571 Nagasaki was opened for Portuguese ships, after an agreement with daimy≈ç ≈åmura Sumitada who converted to Catholicism, and a flourishing trade established between the two cities, that would become known as \\"Nanban trade period\\". Missionary activities in Japan had begun in 1549, when Jesuit co-founder Francis Xavier was received in a friendly manner and permitted to preach. Jesuits established congregations in Hirado, Yamaguchi and Bungo (by 1579 there were about 130,000 converts) and many daimy≈çs converted to Christianity, some to gain access to trade and arms. An attempt to reach China was made in 1552 by Francis Xavier, after being sought to talk to the Chinese Emperor in the favor of Portuguese being held prisoners in Guangzhou, but he died off mainland China, at Shangchuan Island: although Macau had been granted to Portuguese, contacts with continental China were always cautious and, starting in 1517, several Portuguese embassies were stalled while trying. In 1576 Pope Gregory XIII included Japan in the Portuguese diocese of Macau. In September 1578 Alessandro Valignano arrived at Macau as a visitor of Jesuit Missions in the Indies, to examine and when necessary reorganize, answering to the Jesuit Superior in Rome. No missions had succeeded in establishing in mainland China, while in Japan they multiplied. Language study had always been one of the core problems: in his view, it was necessary first to learn to speak, read, and write the Chinese language. To this end, he wrote to the Superior in India, who sent to Macau Jesuit scholar Michele Ruggieri (ÁæÖÊòéÂ†Ö)Yves Camus, \\"Jesuits' Journeys in Chinese Studies\\" \\"Dicion√°rio Portugu√™s-Chin√™s : Ëë°Êº¢Ë©ûÂÖ∏ (Pu-Han Cidian): Portuguese-Chinese dictionary\\", by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W.

Ricci joined him in Macau in 1582. and together, they become the first European scholars of China and the Chinese language. In 1579 Valignano made his first visit to Japan. Before the Visitor arrived, seventeen of Valignano's personally appointed missionaries wrote to him complaining that language training was totally nonexistent. Lacking fluency in the Japanese language, Francis Xavier had limited to reading aloud a Japanese translation of a catechism, however Jesuits established several congregations. In 1563 Oda Nobunaga favored Jesuit missionary Lu√≠s Fr√≥is, and generally tolerated Christianity. It was Valignano's first official act upon arriving in Japan that all new missionaries in the province spend two years in a language course, separating these newcomers by leaps and bounds from the first enthusiastic but stilted efforts of Francis Xavier. On 9 June 1580 ≈åmura Sumitada ceded jurisdiction over Nagasaki and Mogi to the Society of Jesus. On August 25, the armies of Philip II of Spain won the Battle of Alc√¢ntara, claiming the throne of Portugal and accomplishing the union of the empires so feared in Macau and Nagasaki, as it threatened the Chinese permission to stay in Macau, and challenged their carefully built trade monopoly as it opened to the Spanish based in the Philippines. In 1582, from Japan, Valignano sent an embassy The Christian Century in Japan 1549‚Äì1650 C. R. Boxer, to the Pope and the kings of Europe sponsored by Kirishitan daimyos Sumitada, ≈åtomo S≈çrin and Arima Harunobu, whom he accompanied via Macau to Goa. In 1583, the Portuguese in Macau were permitted to form a Senate and kept sovereignty. Macau prospered, and Jesuits engaged in the trade. This breach of ecclesiastical practice did not go unnoticed by other European missions in the area, or by those living via inter-Asiatic trade. Eventually, the Pope was forced to intervene, and, in 1585, ordered an immediate cessation of all mercantile activities by the Society. Valignano made an impassioned appeal to the Pope, as Jesuit needed the funds to their many enterprises. A page from the manuscript Portuguese-Chinese dictionary created by Ruggieri, Ricci, and Fernandez (between 1583-88) In 1594 St. Paul's College of Macau was authorized by the Jesuit superior in Rome, by upgrading the previous Madre de Deus school. At first the college included two seminaries for lay brothers, a university with faculties of arts, philosophy and theology, a primary school and a school of music and arts. By 1595 Valignano could boast in a letter that not only had the Jesuits printed a Japanese grammar (see Arte da Lingoa de Iapam) and dictionary (see Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam (Nippo Jisho)), published in a printing press established in Nagasaki, but also several books (mostly the lives of saints and martyrs) entirely in Japanese. The main body of the grammar and dictionary was compiled from 1590‚Äì1603; when finished, it was a truly comprehensive volume with the dictionary alone containing some 32,798 entries. Between 1597 and 1762 it had immense influence on the learning of Eastern languages and culture by missionary Jesuits, making Macau a base for the spreading of Christianity in China and in Japan. Its academic program soon became comprehensive and equivalent to that of a university: it included core disciplines such as theology, philosophy, and mathematics, geography, astronomy, and Latin, Portuguese and Chinese. Many famous scholars taught and learned at this college, that became home to the first western sinologists such as Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest. Macau was thus the training ground for missions in Asia. From 1597 until 1762, Jesuit priests entering into China would always come first to Macau where, at St. Paul‚Äôs College, they would learn to speak Chinese together with other areas of Chinese knowledge, including philosophy and comparative religion, gathering a body of knowledge that would lead to the Jesuit position in defense of the adoption of local practices in the Chinese Rites controversy. It was the largest seminary in East Asia at the time, and the first western- style university in the region.

He is the chairman and chief executive officer of Soho Properties, a Manhattan-based real estate company. El-Gamal came to international attention in 2010 for his role in the development of Park51, a planned Islamic community center and prayer space to be located about two blocks away from the World Trade Center site. Biography El-Gamal was born in Brooklyn, New York to an Egyptian Muslim father and a Roman Catholic mother of Polish descent on December 23, 1973. He lived in Brooklyn until age 9 when his mother died. He then followed his father to Liberia and Egypt where he attended the Schutz American School. El-Gamal returned to the United States for college, enrolling in various New York universities but eventually dropping out when he decided to stop pursuing formal education. Real estate El-Gamal first entered real estate in the late 1990s as a residential sales broker but within his first year transitioned to commercial real estate sales. In 2002 he received his real estate broker's license. According to the company's website, El-Gamal founded his real estate company Soho Properties in 2003 in order \\"to focus on commercial real estate capital markets, advisory and retail leasing.\\" El- Gamal's partners in the business are his brother, Sammy El-Gamal, and Nour Mousa. In 2007, El-Gamal bought a six apartments building in the Harlem and Washington Heights neighborhoods of Manhattan. He managed additional properties in Chelsea and Harlem. In July 2009, Soho Properties purchased property at 45‚Äì47 Park Place, located adjacent to the World Trade Center site. In November 2009, Soho Properties purchased a 12-story office building located at 31 West 27th Street for $45.7 million. El-Gamal said, \\"We just bought it for the income. It's got great long-term leases, and the financing was really attractive. We have five years at a very attractive interest rate, and it's probably the best B building in this submarket.\\" Soho Properties purchased it from the Witkoff Group, which had purchased the building in 2006 for $31.5 million. Soho Properties sold the property to the San Francisco-based Walnut Hill Group in 2012 for $65 million. In February 2014, El-Gamal announced a partnership to build a new home for the 83-year-old Garment Center Synagogue in Manhattan, as part of a 29-story retail center and hotel at 560 Seventh Avenue. El-Gamal said, \\"We're in the process of buying one of the last untouched corners of Times Square... with an opportunity to secure the future of a synagogue that will serve the Jewish community for decades to come.\\" In 2018, Soho Properties announced that this project would be the Margaritaville Resort Times Square. In May 2016, Soho Properties announced that it had secured $219 million in construction financing for 45 Park Place, a 43-story luxury condominium development. The financing structure, involving banks from the Middle East, Asia and Europe, is Sharia-compliant. El-Gamal said, \\"Essentially, it's the largest syndicated Sharia-compliant construction loan in New York City.\\" Construction at 45 Park Place is currently underway. A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the site on June 2, 2016. The tower is expected to be completed in 2018. Adjacent to 45 Park Place at 49‚Äì51 Park Place, Soho Properties is constructing a three-story museum and sanctuary designed by architect Jean Nouvel. =Park51= Shortly after the purchase of 45‚Äì47 Park Place, the property became an active overflow prayer space for the followers of a mosque located in TriBeCa. In May 2010, plans by El-Gamal to develop the property into a $100 million, 13 story Islamic community center and prayer space ignited national controversy given the building's proximity to Ground Zero. El-Gamal envisioned that the project, entitled Park51, as \\"a landmark, an iconic building that will have people come and visit it from around the world.\\" He repeatedly refused calls to move or cancel the project, stating, \\"This looks like it is going to be the most famous community center in the world.\\" In 2014, El-Gamal said that on that site he now intended to construct a smaller, three-story museum \\"dedicated to exploring the faith of Islam and its arts and culture\\" at the same location. Personal life El- Gamal is an observant Muslim. He is married to his wife, Rebekah, and they have three children.

It is thought to be the oldest settlement on the island. There is a church, a pub (the Old Town Inn), two cafes, a small convenience shop and a day nursery. It is a popular tourist area and is only a short distance from the island's airport. Three art and pottery studios are located on the lane heading north out of the village. As well as a number of self-catering holiday properties, Old Town also has a large proportion of dwellings permanently occupied by local residents. The Five Islands School, as well as the main sports and fitness centre for St Mary's, is located just by Old Town. Old Town Bay forms a natural harbour and links the village with the open sea; there is an old quay and there continues to be a slipway in use. History View of Old Town and the bay from the terraced graveyard; it is the resting place of many of those who have died in nearby shipwrecks. In medieval times this was the main harbour, administrative centre and settlement of the Isles of Scilly. The island of St Mary's was then known as Ennor, and Old Town was named Porth Ennor or Porthenor (being the main harbour settlement of the island). It declined with the development of The Garrison and neighbouring Hugh Town, which in turn replaced Old Town as the main harbour, administrative centre and settlement of the Isles. =Ennor Castle= On a small but prominent knoll are the fragmentary remains of a small shell keep castle dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth century, known as Ennor Castle, the only medieval castle on the islands. It became redundant after Star Castle (at The Garrison) was built in the late sixteenth century, and much of its stone was then robbed for buildings in Old Town. Church On the other side of the bay to the settlement lies St Mary's Old Church (commonly known as Old Town Church) which is surrounded by an old, terraced graveyard as well as the newer municipal cemetery. The dedication of the church to St Mary then gave that name to the island parish, replacing the older name of Ennor; the naming after the parish church is also the case with a number of other islands in Scilly. Common with other Cornish parishes, the church is located a little distance from the main settlement of the parish, and there once was a small \\"churchtown\\" surrounding the church; today however there are no other buildings in the vicinity of the church. The parish church of St Mary's is now in Hugh Town, also dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, though the Old Church is used for Sunday evening services (Easter-September)Scilly Bells Church and the cemetery belonging to the Council of the Isles of Scilly lies adjacent.Council of the Isles of Scilly Cemetery Notable residents Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson was a resident of Hugh Town (in a simple, plain bungalow called 'Lowenva') and is now buried in the cemetery at the church at Old Town.

It was established in 2000 and covers 4234.78 km¬≤.World Database on Protected Areas Overview A protected area was created in January 2000 in this ecosystem in the centre of Cameroon, and named the Mbam Djerem National Park. It covers 4200 square kilometres, of which about half is lowland tropical forest, and half is Sudano-Guinean tree and woodland savannah, with a wide ecotone belt between the two. This straddling of two major vegetation zones gives Mbam Djerem probably the highest habitat diversity of all the protected areas in Cameroon. The new National Park boasts gallery forests, transitional forests and rainforests, different types of savannahs ranging from almost completely closed woodland through bush savannah, to open, seasonally flooded grasslands next to the major rivers one of which has a spectacular waterfall. Standing on any hilltop in the Park affords a view of ridge after ridge vanishing into the distance, some of them forested, some savannah, and all valleys clothed in a strip of gallery forest along the water‚Äôs edge. The Park is watered by the upper Sanaga basin: the main river of the park is the Djerem, which becomes the Sanaga itself further south. This river is navigable throughout its length in the Park and allows access from the savannahs of the north into the heart of the forest. Surveys have covered much of the Park and the major vegetation zones have been explored. The first survey took place in March 2000, and covered the eastern half of the Park. The survey team were navigating using the maps available from the Centre Geographique National, which, although printed in 1976, were produced from aerial photographs taken in the 1950s and 1960s. The maps show most of the south of the Park to be savannah. However, when the team approached the centre of the Park, although the map showed that the habitat should be bush savannah, they found themselves walking through shady woodland. On closer inspection, all the trees were not only mostly the same species (Xylopia aethiopica), they were all about the same age. Mixed in among this forest were dying individuals of typical savannah trees and bushes (such as Hymenocardia acida, Piliostigma thonningii, Bridelia ferruginea). There was little grass on the forest floor. Older local people interviewed from the villages to the west of the Park remember the area from forty years ago as grassland and bush with gallery forests along the rivers. Closed-canopy lowland forest was found much further to the east, near River Djerem. The forests of Central Africa go through long cycles of expansion and reduction, linked with long-term climatic cycles. The ecotone Across Cameroon, and its neighbours to east and west, lies a zone known as the ecotone. This is the northern fringe of the Central African forests, where gallery forest tendrils reach out into the great savannahs of the north. The band of ecotone has, as a consequence, representatives of the flora and fauna of both forest and savannah. It has been highlighted as an area where differences within species may be the precursor to speciation. Rural depopulation, human activities and current threats A dirt road runs along the western border of the Park, which was once the main road from the Cameroon border to Chad, over a thousand kilometres away. In the colonial era, people who used to live in what is now the Park were relocated to this road. In the last few decades, the railway line (CamRail) that connects Garoua to Yaound√©, which runs along the eastern side of the Park, has taken most of the freight and passengers away from this axis, and the young people who come from the villages that are along the old road are drifting to the cities. There are no villages inside the Park, but it was known that there is some hunting, including larger animals such as African buffalo, waterbuck, and kob, often destined for the bushmeat markets of the distant cities. Cattle herders also seasonally use the area, especially in the more open grasslands of the northern part of the Park. The railway line is much more frequented and is a major conduit for the bushmeat trade, funnelling wild animal meat from the centre of Cameroon down to the populous centres of Yaounde and Bertoua. Wildlife As a precursor to management, the conservation potential of Mbam Djerem was assessed for large and small mammals, birds, habitats, and the degree of use by humans. Of particular interest was the status of the elephant population in the area, including any evidence of seasonal movements. The large mammal and bird surveys were carried out by WCS, helped by Deborah Pires who surveyed the bats and small mammals. The Birdlife Important Bird Area team also surveyed the northern part of the Park in 2000. Four major surveys were carried out, covering all four quarters of the Park. The fauna is very diverse. As in many Central African sites, large mammal abundance increases with increased distance from the road and the villages. True savannah species such as baboon Papio anubis and warthog Phacochoerus africanus occur literally within metres of species of true forest animals, including crowned guenon Cercopithecus pogonias and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus, which here are found right up to the edges of the savannah. All three species of pig occur in the Park (red river hog, warthog, and giant forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), and there are hippo Hippopotamus amphibius at several sites along the Djerem river. In addition, there are species of forest-savannah mosaic habitats such as bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus and yellow-backed duiker Cephalophus sylvicultor. Within a few hundred metres it is possible to see signs of Kob Kobus kob, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus, and to hear putty-nosed monkeys Cercopithecus nictitans -a strange mixture of forest and savannah wildlife all at one site. Ungulate diversity is high: apart from those mentioned above there are bongo and sitatunga (Tragelaphus euryceros and T. scriptus), several species of duiker (confirmed are blue, red-flanked, Grimm's, black-fronted). The presence of at least ten species of primate, including chimpanzees Pan troglodytes has been confirmed by the study teams either by direct observation of animals or their signs or by hearing their vocalisations, and local hunters suggested there could be still more. One of the most vulnerable animals in the Park is elephant. They occur in the south- centre of the Park but seem to be completely absent in the north (both east and west sides of the Park). Gorillas occur outside the Park, to the southeast, in the Lom-Pangar area (Fotso et al. 2002) but are not found in the Park. The area where they occur is now Deng Deng National Park. The first bird list for Mbam Djerem, a synthesis of the Fotso and Bobo/ Languy surveys, numbered 360 species, and, as for the mammal fauna, included both true savannah species such as brown-rumped bunting Emberiza affinis, black-bellied firefinch Lagonosticta rara, lesser blue-eared starling Lamprotornis chloropterus, white-collared starling Grafisia torquata, brubru Nilaus afer and yellow penduline tit Anthoscopus parvulus and true forest species such as some of the hornbills: black and white casqued hornbill Ceratogymna subcylindricus, black casqued hornbill Ceratogymna atrata, red-billed dwarf hornbill Tockus camurus, and passerines such as Bleda syndactyla, Bleda eximia, Alethe diademata, Stiphrornis erythrothorax Criniger Calurus, Indicator maculatus (Fotso 2000). The Bamenda Apalis Apalis bamendae was discovered to be relatively widespread throughout the area (Bobo & Languy 2000 a,b; Fotso 2000) - this bird had previously thought to have been restricted to a small area in the Bamenda Highlands of Northwest Cameroon, two hundred kilometres to the west of Mbam Djerem. The Park has not only a wide diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, but also of seasonal extremes of temperature. In the dry season, bushfires reduce the grasses to ash. Rivers and swampy valleys dry up completely. This seasonality has important implications for the animals that require frequent water: they are obliged to remain near the larger rivers for several months at a time. Normally water is not a limiting factor for humid forest species, but the forest animals here may be on the edge of their physical limits. This information is well known by hunters, who use the grassy plains near the major rivers during the wet season; kob, buffalo and waterbuck are found here during this season, and hunters travel in from the railway line to transport meat out to the east. Conservation issues It is clear that the Mbam Djerem National Park contains a representative bloc of the habitat diversity that comprises the ecotone area of Cameroon and its neighbours. The large mammal fauna, now almost gone in West Africa, is still present, although threatened by commercial bushmeat (and some ivory) hunting. Local people in the area have few other activities that bring in money: profits on the small- scale agricultural products grown in the area are much lower than those gained by selling meat. The main methods of commercial hunting are thick wire snares aimed at the larger ungulates, and gun hunting, although small game hunting is carried out using thin wire snares near the villages (often outside the Park border).

This site is in area. The reserve was originally created in 1941. The hills are late tertiary volcanic rocks. Fauna include elephants, chimpanzee, drill and Preuss's monkey. Location and habitation The Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve (RHFR) is located at latitude 4¬∞51‚Ä≤26‚Ä≥ N and longitude 9¬∞07‚Ä≤15‚Ä≥ E in Ndian division, South West Region of Cameroon. Previously known as the Rumpi Hills Native Administration Forest Reserve, it was created by Forestry Ordinance No 38 of 1937 and approved by Forestry Ordinance No 16756/79 of 2 July 1941.SWPA, 2016.Mukete et al., 2018b. The Northern boundary is the road from Lipenja Mukete through Ikoi and Dikome Ngolo to Madie. The Southern boundary goes through Nalende, Monyange, Itoki and Ilor to Moko. Meanwhile, the Eastern boundary goes through Dikome Balue, Mofako, Itende to Bisoro. Finally, the West boundary goes through Dibonda and Ndian and Ituka to Lipenja which is also the starting point of the reserve.SWPA, 2016 These boundaries give the Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve a horse-shoe shape. thumb The reserve is composed of land belonging to the Ngolo, Bima and Balue tribes, the first two form part of the North West while the latter, forms part of the South East area. Most of the villages are on top of the hills, so that, a more or less vertical climb of anything up to 400 meters has to be faced before reaching a village or settlement.Mukete, 2018. History The proposal that part of the Rumpi hills forests should be made a forest reserve was first made by Mr Donovan Rosevear in a memorandum written in 1933 on the potential forest reserves of the Kumba Division, Cameroon. The actual preliminary survey of the area was done by Mr F.S. Collier in 1937 who after a tour round the approximate boundaries, suggested that about 640 km2 could be reserved. This figure was found to be too high owing to the presence in the middle of the reserve of many hitherto unknown villages. The area of the reserve was reduced to over 290 km2 in 1941 and later expanded to 455 km2 in 1961. thumb This forest reserve encompasses some 52 villages and 19 farm settlements, where these settlements emanated at various times from their parent villages in northern Ngolo. These did not appear as separate villages in the tax registers since their inhabitants paid their taxes to their parent villages. All these offshoots (new settlements) came from villages of Ngolo situated north of the reserve, in an area which was very thickly populated and therefore very heavily farmed. The local inhabitants did not reside in their farms but only visited them from their villages which therefore excluded their rights to reside within the created reserve. All farm settlements i.e. farms in which houses were erected were excluded from the reserve. Though, the boundaries have been fixed clear of those villages in order to allow as much land and room for expansion as is necessary, these village boundaries were not clearly defined. This is because, no information was provided outside the reserve on the area to be available for farming. Therefore, there is insufficient knowledge on how much farming land was made available, hence, difficulties are arising as the village populations continue to grow and as more land for farming is cleared. According to Section 23 of the Forestry Ordinance and in accordance with Section 22 of the said Ordinance, all that piece of land, the situation and limits of which were set forth as demarcated by Mr F.S Collier in 1937, only one enclave existed within the forest zone (Bweme Ngolo). The rest, part of their forests and lands were cut as the reserve was traced. Recently, many villages have crossed into the forest land though they were allowed to hunt and fish with respect to the Wildlife Animals Preservation Ordinance, CAP. 99. Additionally, the villagers had the right to collect food material and other minor non-timber forest products used in the villages which were not to be sold or bartered outside. The villagers also had rights to collect building poles and materials and fuel from Pycnanthus kombo (caraboard) and for all other trees except timber according to Forestry Ordinance No 38/37. All these were for strictly domestic use within the villages and not for sale or bartered outside. Villagers were also allowed to take cocoa from trees in farms existing at the time of the reserve officer‚Äôs judgment dated 20 April 1938 but not to extend such farms or to plant new trees. The villagers were also allowed the right to collect produce from existing farms within the reserve for a period of four years commencing from 1 April 1938. Economy Given that majority of the population is rural with little opportunities for livelihood diversification, over 90% of the local population is engaged in agriculture. Cultivated food crops include cocoyams, plantains, yams, and cassava while cash crops are oil palm, rubber tree, and cocoa. The establishment of huge agro-industrial companies like Pamol Plantation Plc close to the southern border and SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon nearer the north border is a cause for concern.Lyonga, 2012.Kimengsi and Lambi, 2015.Mukete et al., 2017a. Aside from agriculture, other livelihood activities in the RHFR include the harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), animal rearing and petit trading mostly as off-season jobs when pressure on crop cultivation is reduced. Others are employed as laborers in Pamol Plantations Plc, smallholder plantations and in small private businesses. Meanwhile, in high altitude forest areas of Dikome Balue and Toko local councils, hunting and NTFPs gathering are important activities for the local communities. Gathered NTFPs include bush mango (Irvingia gabonsensis), bitter cola (Garcinia cola), njansang (Ricinodendron heudelotii), country onion (Afrostyrax lepidophyllus), bush pepper (Piper guineense), land snails (Archachatina marginata) and varieties of edible mushroom species.Chuyong et al., 2011.Etongo & Glover, 2012. Geography The soils are composed of Precambrian clays and sandstones which may have emanated from various volcanic eruptions.Yerima & Van Ranst, 2005. Located within the equatorial climatic zone, the area exhibits two seasons; the dry season from November to April and the rainy season from May to October with annual rainfall that ranges between 4027‚Äì6368 mm. Mean monthly maximum temperatures in the dry season are estimated at 31.8¬∞C and 18.2¬∞C during the rainy season. The relative humidity is high during most of the year with minimum monthly values ranging between 78% and 90%. Flora and fauna Given that the RHFR varies in terms of heights above sea level with its highest point Rata Mountain tipping at 1800 m, there is some diversity in terms of vegetation. For example, along with an elevation gradient between 900‚Äì1800 m consists of an extension of sub-montane forests. In general, the forests are mixed but dominated by Caesalpinioid legumes.Mukete et al., 2018c. Trees may reach heights of 35 m with a canopy and foliage cover ranging from 60% to 90%. The canopy is usually full of climbers and the cloud forests appearance is as a result of the ever-present epiphytes. This diverse landscape of the RHFR supports habitats for a wide range of animals some of which are endemic. Over 198 bird species have been identified, including the endangered white-throated mountain-babbler (Kupeornis gilberti), whitenecked pigeon (Columba albinucha) and green- breasted bush-shrike (Malaconotus gladiator). Additionally, many tropical montane mammal, reptile and amphibian species such as the endangered Drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), Forest shrew (Myosorex rumpii), Porcupine (Hystrix cristata) and Hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) have been identified.BirdLife International, 2014.

Notable in the Dzanga sector is a gorilla density of , one of the highest densities ever reported for the western lowland gorilla. Between the two sectors of the national park stretches the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve . The national park and the special reserve, each with its own protective status, are a part of the Dzanga-Sangha Complex of Protected Areas (DSPAC). Geography The Sangha Tri National Landscape. Dzanga-Ndoki National Park is the triangular part. The Dzanga-Sangha National Park is located in the extreme southwest of the Central African Republic in a triangular-shaped part of the country. The main river running through this region is the Sangha River. The precise border between the Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo is located at (in the Sangha River), marking the furthest point of the park to the southwest. The park's altitude ranges from above sea level. The whole park is on alluvial sands. Along streams, forest clearings can be found with marshy depressions referred to as 'bai'. The Dzanga Bai (translation: \\"the village of elephants\\") is a sandy salt lick that measures . It is traversed through the middle by the Dzanga, a stream. Since 1997, Bai Hokou has the base site of the Primate Habituation Programme where gorilla habituation for tourism has been ongoing, along with research. Logging occurred in the 1980s in the Dzanga sector but not in the Ndoki which is primary forest. Amis Kamiss wrote in 2006 of having visited fifteen diamond mining sites in the Lob√© River region, located in the northwestern part of the national park. Fauna and flora There are three types of forest within Dzanga-Ndoki National Park: mainly dryland, a semi- evergreen forest that contains swamp-forest areas along the rivers and, a closed-canopy, monodominant Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest. The dryland forest is an open, mixed canopy that is dominated by Sterculiaceae and Ulmaceae; often associated with it is a dense understorey of Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae. Along the Sangha River, there are stands of Guibourtia demeusii. There are several intact populations of key forest fauna including the western lowland gorilla, African forest elephant, chimpanzee, giant forest hog, red river hog, sitatunga, endangered bongo, African forest buffalo, and six species of duiker. The gorilla density of 1.6 individuals/km2 within the Dzanga sector is one of the highest densities ever reported for the western lowland gorilla. The Dzanga-Ndoki National Park has been designated an Important Bird Area (#CF008). The IBA is contiguous with two other IBAs, Lob√©k√© of Cameroon (#CM033) and Nouabal√©-Ndoki in Congo (#CG001). Over 350 bird species have been reported at the national park of which at least 260 can be expected to breed. Stiphrornis sanghensis has been described as a new species noted only within Dzanga-Sangha, but further investigation is pending as it may also occur in adjacent parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Republic of the Congo. In May 2013, the slaughtering of 26 African forest elephants by poachers in Dzanga Bai, a reserve in the world heritage site Sangha TrinationalWorld Heritage Site: Sangha Trinational led to worldwide concern by conservationists.

Nicaragua is a Danish programme country since 1993. History The Danish-Nicaraguan development co-operation began in 1981. In 1993, Nicaragua was chosen as one of 20 programme countries for Danish development assistance. In 1989 Denmark was part of a group of countries that combined to give $20 million to Nicaragua in response to domestic concessions which led to the 1990 general election which ousted the Sandinista National Liberation Front from power.Democracy and Socialism in Sandinista Nicaragua By Harry E. Vanden, Gary Prevost In the 1990s, Denmark donated $1.8 million to support the clearance of landmines in Nicaragua. 8,700 landmines were cleared in the area where Denmark finances activities. Danish assistance The Danish development programme assists Nicaragua within four priority sectors: transportation, agriculture, environment and education. In July 2007 the Danish Development Research Network secretariat compiled an overview of on-going research collaboration between Denmark and Nicaragua within the areas of agriculture, environment and governance. In 2009 Denmark announced it would reduce its aid from about $35 million in 2009 to about $26 million in 2010, also saying it would redirect some of the aid towards civil society actors rather than direct assistance to Nicaragua's government. The announcement was made by Danish development cooperation minister Ulla T√∏rn√¶s during a visit to the Latin American country where she met president Daniel Ortega. T√∏rn√¶s also called on the Nicaraguan government to respect democratic norms with regards to free elections. Denmark helps Nicaragua with building a road between the two municipalities; Nueva Guinea and Bluefields. In 2010 Denmark went on to announce their intention to stop providing all development funds to Nicargaua, though they did not indicate a firm date for this to happen. This was presented as part of Denmarks overall strategy to stop giving aid to Latin American countries so it can better focus its development budget on Africa. In 2010, Lene Espersen said that Denmark will close their embassy in Managua. In February 2011, Denmark assisted Nicaragua with $18 million to the Nicaraguan general election, 2011, but the government of Nicaragua refused the money.

From 2000 to 2001, he was also a member of the so-called Bergier Commission, which re-considered Swiss policies during the Second World War.  Scholarship  Daniel Th√ºrer is noted for an original humanist approach to international law that eschews simplistic realism as well as the positivism still prevalent in international legal scholarship. His multi-layered approach is best illustrated by the 2008 lecture on International Humanitarian Law at the Hague Academy,http://www.brill.nl/default.aspx?partid=210&pid;=34040 where this highly technical body of law is, through an inter-disciplinary methodology incorporating religion, history and moral philosophy, re- interpreted to honour its original purpose of reducing human suffering and protecting civilians. While he maintains a strong idealist belief in the transformative power of international law, his scholarship also advocates a bottom-up approach relying on successful local or regional institutions and traditions.http://www.nzz.ch/2006/11/18/pl/articleenpv8_1.76520.html More recently, he has focussed on applying the traditional concept of the res publica to modern constitutional law.Besinnung auf den Staat als liberale ‚ÄûRepublik‚Äú, in: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung Nr. 31. 7/8 February 2009, S. 15.

Although he wrote on a variety of subjects, he is chiefly known for his extensive research and writings on the life and works of Ludwig van Beethoven. Unger, the son of a factory owner, studied from 1904 to 1906 at the Leipzig Conservatory, and entered the University of Leipzig in 1908. There, he studied under Heinrich Z√∂llner and Hugo Riemann.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, CD-Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, S. 7.315. In 1911, he completed a doctorate with a dissertation on Muzio Clementi. After serving in World War I, he worked as editor of the New Journal of Music in 1919 and 1920. From 1932 to 1939, he lived in Zurich and catalogued the valuable Beethoven collection of local industrialist Hans Conrad Bodmer, which was later bequeathed to the Beethoven House in Bonn. In 1939, Unger moved to Volterra in Pisa. While he had been denounced by the Militant League for German Culture as a \\"musical Bolshevik\\" in 1935, he cooperated with the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce and the Amt Rosenberg beginning in 1942 or 1943.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 626. His job was to catalogue sheet music seized from Jews in occupied Paris, including the personal collection of escaped harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. Unger returned from Italy to Zurich in 1957. He is considered one of the most important Beethoven scholars of the first half of the 20th Century. His books and papers were acquired by the Beethoven House in 1961.

He has had over 200 books published, which have sold in the millions, including folk song collections, anthologies and method books for the guitar, banjo and fiddle. He has taught guitar to hundreds of students. He has presented concerts and lectures at schools, universities and concert halls in the U.S. and abroad. Among his notable books are The Undying Flame: Ballads and Songs of the Holocaust‚Äô‚Äô, which contains 110 songs in 16 languages - Yiddish, German, Hebrew,Spanish, French, Dutch, Italian, Ladino, Serbo-Croatian, Greek, Norwegian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Hungarian and English. The songs include the works of concentration camp prisoners and inhabitants of the ghettos of Eastern Europe as well anti-Fascist anthems inspired by the Spanish Civil War, Red Army songs, and songs of Resistance fighters; New York Sings ‚Äì 400 Years of the Empire State in Song (reviewed by his friend and colleague Pete Seeger). Seeger and Silverman were both editors at Sing Out! A Folk Music Magazine in the 1960s.; The Baseball Songbook ‚Äì Songs and Images from the Early Years of America‚Äôs Favorite Pastime; The Folk Song Encyclopedia (a two volume compilation of over 1,000 folk songs; words, music and guitar chords); The Complete Book of Bach Chorales (translated into English); Ballads and Songs of the Civil War (piano-vocal with guitar chords); The Guitar Player's Guide and Almanac (a combined method book and survey of musical, technical and anecdotal information); Of Thee I Sing (patriotic American songs from the Revolutionary War to the present). Early life Jerry‚Äôs father, Bill (b. London, 1896) and mother Helen Mindlin (b. Dubrovna, Russia, 1898) were married in New York in 1928. They followed the newly constructed subway line from the crowded tenements of the Lower East Side of Manhattan to the northeast Bronx in the Allerton neighborhood, near Bronx Park and the New York Botanical Garden. It was populated largely by eastern European Jewish immigrant families. Gerard ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù Silverman (b. 1931) was their only child. Bill was a self employed fabric supplier for Broadway theatrical productions, but was also an accomplished amateur mandolin player. Jerry began taking classical mandolin lessons at the nearby Neighborhood Music School with teacher Matthew Kahn at age 10. In the summer of 1945, Jerry attended Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (Workers Children‚Äôs Camp) in Hackettstown, New Jersey, where for the first time he was exposed to 78 rpm recordingsof folk singer Woody Guthrie, blues singer Josh White, The Almanac Singers, Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson (who was the ‚Äúpatron saint‚Äù of the camp), union songs and songs of the Spanish Civil War. It was a life-changing experience for him. He began teaching himself the guitar when he returned home from camp. Jerry returned to Wo-Chi-Ca (with guitar) in 1946, and as a counselor in 1947 and 1948, where he met Joe Jaffe, who played banjo and guitar with Seeger occasionally. Jerry started studying with Joe at the Neighborhood Music School in 1947. In 1948, Jaffe suggested that Jerry take over as the guitar teacher at the School when he left. Jerry graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx in 1948, enrolled in CCNY (City College of New York) in Spring 1949 and graduated in Spring 1952 with a B.S. degree in Music. He was the first ‚Äúnon-classical‚Äù music major to earn that degree. In 1955 he earned a Master‚Äôs degree in Musicology at NYU (New York University). The subject of his master‚Äôs dissertation: ‚ÄúTHE BLUES GUITAR ‚Äì As Illustrated by the Practices of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly) and Josh White.‚Äù The research he conducted on blues led directly to the publication in 1958 by MacMillan of his first book: ‚ÄúFolk Blues‚Äù, which contains 110 traditional blues arranged for voice, piano and guitar. Here is a brief excerpt from the introduction to the book which sets the tone of the work: ‚ÄúIn spite of the perennial popularity of blues songs‚Ä¶no collection has ever been available before now. I became aware of the scarcity of published scholarly material dealing with the blues and the complete absence of any general folk blues collections before now while doing graduate work in music at New York University. Since then, as a teacher and professional performer, I have been plagued by this glaring and inexplicable sin of omission ‚Äì so much so that I decided to do the job myself.‚Äù Sing Out! Magazine In 1951, Silverman began writing music transcriptions and arrangements for the new monthly publication ‚Äò‚ÄôSing Out!, The Folksong Magazine‚Äô‚Äô. Eventually, he took on full responsibility as the Music Editor. Fundraising for the magazine led to well-publicized Hootenannys, which were led by Pete Seeger, and where Silverman performed regularly. Many of these ‚Äúhoots‚Äù were recorded on LP, and a notable recording of \\"Mule-Skinner Blues\\" included Silverman on lead, accompanied by Seeger and Sonny Terry on harmonica. Career In 1952, Silverman was the first non-classical student to graduate from CCNY with a B.S. of Music. He then entered the graduate studies of Musicology program at New York University, also the first folk musician to enter into this program. After writing his Masters Thesis on \\"the blues guitar‚Äù, Macmillan published his first book ‚ÄúFolk Blues‚Äù in 1958. ‚Äò‚ÄôFolkways Records‚Äô‚Äô asked Silverman to expand the 16-page instructional brochure that had been inserted into the jacket of Seeger‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄôFolkways‚Äô‚Äô LP. The book, entitled ‚ÄúThe Folksinger‚Äôs Guitar Guide‚Äù was published in 1962. It was the first guitar instruction book for folksinging guitarists and sold well over 300,000 copies. That publication led Silverman in the direction of writing a long series of other method books and folksong anthologies. He has had over 200 books published since, with the last being New York Sings! in March 2009. Personal life He currently lives in Westchester, New York. In 1967, he married Tatiana Cherniacoski and they have three children: David (b. 1969), Mikael (b. 1978) and Antoine Silverman (b. 1972).

Finding correspondences to the minimalist architecture of Mies Van Der Rohe, the essay calls Nancy \\"a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by [its] designer.\\" Deconstruction \\"How to Read Nancy\\" is distinguished by its extensive analysis of a single Nancy comic strip originally published on August 8, 1959. The essay successively isolates and discusses the strip's individual formal elements (including the placement of word balloons, the level of the horizon line, the spotting of blacks, and panel shape and size) to demonstrate each codependent aspect of comics syntax. The essay has been used in a variety of university level courses about comics; a full 25% of syllabi listed on the National Association of Comics Arts Educators (NACAE) website include the essay in their required reading. \\"How to Read Nancy\\" is an outgrowth of Karasik and Newgarden‚Äôs lifelong interest in Bushmiller‚Äôs work.

After school graduation in 1853 at the University of Christiania and other exams the following year he began to study theology, but he was more keen to cultivate their literary and artistic interests. In 1862 he married painter Johanne Mathilde Dietrichson. For a time he served as instructor at Uppsala University and subsequently for three years was secretary to the Norwegian minister at Rome. On his return he became connected with the administration of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. In 1869, he was appointed professor in the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. Six years later he moved to the University of Christiania as professor of the history of art. Dietrichson was a well-known participator in the public health debate in both Norway and neighboring Sweden, and as such, he was known for his opposition toward corsets, which at this point in time was a serious health issue, and as such supported the Swedish Dress Reform Society, and notably helped to spread the movement to Norway.Bagerius, Henric..

Thema og Variationer over et norsk Folkesagn. Et polemisk Digt (1879) and numerous other works. After examining Danish and Swedish 18th century literature, he published two-volume Omrids af den norske Poesis Historie (1866-1869).

It is named after Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, governor general of British North America from 1835 to 1835. It is the 21st highest peak in Quebec and 4th in Southern Quebec. It is made of gneiss and granulite dating from the Precambrian era. Environmental protection Since 1978, Mount Gosford is included in \\"ZEC Louise-Gosford\\", a controlled harvesting zone open to the public. Recently, the areas at more than 700 metres of altitude were designated Important Bird Areas due to the presence Bicknell's thrushes, an endemic species living in mountain peaks of northeast North America. In 2009, Quebec's Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife set aside part of the Mount Gosford to create an ecological reserve. The same year, about 76 hectares of the mountain was renamed for√™t rare du Mont-Gosford (Mount Gosford's Rare Forest) and declared an exceptional forest ecosystem.

The game is a re-worked version of a previously planned clone of Asteroids in which the player, in a rocket-powered space suit, is drifting in space and shooting down or avoiding targets, including the titular hawks. Space Hawk was also released by Sears for the \\"Super Video Arcade,\\" its private-label version of the Intellivision console. Gameplay The object of Space Hawk is to survive as long as possible while drifting in the middle of outer space. The player is equipped with a rocket-powered space suit and a \\"gas blaster\\" for protection. Three user-selectable settings control the player's interaction with the game. The blaster can fire single shots manually or can be set to automatic rapid fire. The player's movement can include or ignore inertia. Lastly, the rotation of the space suit can either be instantaneous (by pushing the controller in the desired direction) or gradual (by holding the controller to the left or right until the desired attitude is reached). Each setting can be changed during the game as often as desired. The player is attacked by large and small mechanical hawks, which must be shot three times before they are destroyed. There are also gas bubbles and comets that can be shot or avoided. In later stages, space amoebas appear that are impervious to the player's weapons and can only be avoided. A collision with any obstacle will cost the player one life. As a last resort, the player's space suit is equipped with a hyperspace function, that will randomly relocate the player to another section of space; however, the player loses points when the hyperspace function is used. Also, from time to time, the player may encounter invisible black holes that will trigger hyperspace automatically. The player starts with a score of 500 points. Points are earned whenever targets are destroyed and lost whenever the player is destroyed or enters hyperspace. As score increases, multipliers are applied and difficulty increases. Development Space Hawk was the second attempt at crafting a version of Atari's popular arcade game Asteroids. After company lawyers demanded changes for fear of a lawsuit, the first re-working became Astrosmash. Programmer Bill Fisher began working with the previous prototype with the intent of developing a game similar to Asteroids while being different enough to avoid legal action. During development, a bug was discovered that would randomly trigger hyperspace even when the corresponding button on the controller was not pressed. It was determined that simultaneously pressing the controller disc in a certain direction and using the controller's side action buttons was being interpreted by the console as pressing the key on the keypad that activated hyperspace. Ultimately, as the bug could not be removed completely, the developers added the \\"black holes\\" to explain why the player would sometimes jump to hyperspace at random. Legacy The game was re-released as part of the Intellivision Lives! collection for personal computers and newer-generation game consoles, and in March 2010, Space Hawk was one of the launch titles for Microsoft's now- defunct Game Room service on its Xbox 360 console and on Games for Windows Live.

The film stars Jamuna, Jaggayya and Sowcar Janaki in the lead roles. It tells the story of a rich man falling in love with a tribal girl, and how the pair face challenges in life when they separate. Chinnari Papalu was the inaugural production of Sri Mata Pictures, and Savitri's directorial debut. Its crew consisted largely of women: director Savitri, producer-writer Sarojini, music director P. Leela, art director Mohana and dance choreographer Rajasulochana, but cinematographers Singh and Sekhar, and editor M. S. N. Murthy were exceptions. Chinnari Papalu was released on 21 June 1968 and despite failing commercially, received critical acclaim and won the Nandi Award for Second Best Feature Film. It was remade by Savitri in Tamil as Kuzhandai Ullam (1969).  Plot  Mahesh, a wealthy man, enters a forest. Over there, he meets a tribal girl named Garika and is smitten by her. After learning of his mother's illness, he leaves the forest, but promises Garika he will marry her upon returning. But his mother fixes his marriage with a woman named Parvathi. Mahesh tells his mother about the promise he made to Garika. When he returns to the forest, he finds the entire hamlet has been washed away due to floods and is informed that Garika died. Distraught, he returns home and marries Parvathi. Unknown to Mahesh, Garika has survived and she gives birth to Mahesh's son Nagaraju. Parvathi gives birth to a daughter named Nandini. Garika comes to the city in search of Mahesh and meets Parvathi, who tells her not to disturb her family life. Garika dies the same day and Nagaraju is put in Mahesh's care, much to Parvathi's dislike. But when Nagaraju battles for his life after saving Nandini, she repents and prays for him. The gardener tells Mahesh that Nagaraju is his son.  Cast  * Jaggayya as Mahesh * Sowcar Janaki as Parvathi * Jamuna as Garika * P. Shanthakumari as Mahesh's mother * Roja Ramani as Nagaraju * Santhikala as Nandini * S. V. Ranga Rao as the gardener * Savitri as the doctor  Production  In the 1960s, women of the Telugu film industry used to meet frequently on festive occasions or simply for get- togethers. During one such meeting, director V. Madhusudhan Rao's wife Veeramachaneni Sarojini suggested they make a film with an all-women team. This suggestion was met with instant support from the other members. It was decided to approach actress Savitri to be the director. Sarojini met Savitri and revealed the idea of an all-women production. Savitri was hesitant to accept the offer of turning director, but after consulting her husband Gemini Ganesan who encouraged her to accept Sarojini's offer, she promptly did so, making her directorial debut. Shortly thereafter the production company Sri Mata Pictures was established and its inaugural production Chinnari Papalu was launched. Besides producing, Sarojini also wrote the film's story. Rajasulochana was assigned as the dance choreographer, P. Leela as the music director, and Mohana as the art director. Despite Sarojini's initial desire to make the film an all-women production, some of the crew were men: Mullapudi Venkata Ramana who wrote the dialogues alongside Sarojini, Singh and Sekhar who handled the cinematography, and M. S. N. Murthy who was the editor. Principal photography began on 12 October 1967 at Vauhini Studios. Thpugh Savitri was initially signed on only to direct the film, she soon found herself having to manage its financial matters.  Soundtrack   Release and reception  Chinnari Papalu was released on 21 June 1968. Although the film became a box-office bomb since it failed to recover even one fourth of its investment, it received critical acclaim and won the Nandi Award for Second Best Feature Film in 1968. The film was later remade in Tamil as Kuzhandai Ullam (1969) with Savitri returning as director.

It was the worst rail disaster in Chilean history until the rail disaster at Queronque in 1986 which killed 58. The accident happened at 8:55 AM in dense fog on a Sunday morning. Train No.3 was held at San Bernardo station waiting for a freight train ahead of it to clear the line. It comprised two first class coaches, a dining car, and five third- class coaches. After a delay of twenty minutes it was given the signal to proceed on its journey south to San Rosendo. But at that same moment it was rammed from behind by Train No.11 bound for Pichilemu destroying the two rear third-class carriages and killing most of the occupants. The impact was so great that a block from the crash site fragments of debris and human remains could be found. Survivors said the disaster could have been much worse as many passengers, bored by the long wait, had alighted from the train and were waiting on the platform. It was also fortunate that the rear two carriages contained many traders with large packages and baskets meaning that these carriages held fewer passengers than those further forward. President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo visited the scene later that morning. According to the official report 38 people were killed and over 58 wounded, although other sources put the death toll at 49 or even 70 dead. The driver of No.11 claimed that the signals were green on his approach to the station, but the subsequent enquiry found no fault with the signals, furthermore if they were obscured then the regulations state that he should have stopped his train as a preventative measure. Seven months after the crash at San Bernardo a very similar accident occurred near Santiago which killed 23 and injured 198. Again, one train ran into the rear of another in thick fog with the driver of the rear train at fault.

World War II Prior to the commencement of World War II Henderson was fitting out the aircraft carrier at Newport News, Virginia and was serving as executive officer when it was placed in commission on October 20, 1941. On April 18, 1942, Henderson was aboard Hornet when she participated in the Doolittle Raid against military and industrial targets in the Japanese home islands. After his tour on Hornet he served a short stint as Chief of Staff and Air to Commander Patrol Wing Two in June 1942. Promoted to captain, Henderson fitted out and commanded the new carrier which was commissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard in Camden, New Jersey in February 1943. Following shakedown in the Caribbean, she was reclassified CVL-23 on July 15, 1943. Princeton participated in the First and Second Rabaul Air Strikes, on November 5 and 11, 1943, severely damaging many enemy combatant ships in Rabaul harbor. By January 1944 Henderson was serving as Commander Aircraft, Munda and Commander Fleet Air Wing One. Here he developed a successful system of combined air and surface operations that annihilated a Japanese barge fleet in the Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago, and severely damaged numerous shore installations. He also initiated the rescue of many downed aircraft crews, often in enemy waters and under heavy fire from enemy shore batteries. In July 1944 Henderson was promoted to rear admiral and took command of Carrier Division 28 with his flag in the escort carrier . Here he directed his ships and squadrons in vigorous aerial offensives against heavily defended enemy bases. Between September 1944 and early 1945 he successively participated in the Invasion of Palau, Battle of Leyte Gulf, and Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, planning and executing full air coverage of approaching and retiring convoys under extremely hazardous conditions, despite repeated attacks by hostile aircraft. At Leyte Gulf his forces departed the area at 1645 on October 24 and thus did not participate in the Battle off Samar. In February 1945 he took command of Carrier Division 25 with his flag in Saginaw Bay for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. In late March 1945 he moved his flag to the escort carrier for the Invasion of Okinawa. As the war was winding down in August 1945 Henderson was serving ashore again as Commander Fleet Air, Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Post war After the war Henderson served as Commandant of Naval Operating Base, Bermuda in May 1946. His next assignment was as Chief of Staff to Commander U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean in October 1947 and later served as the Deputy Commander in Chief of the same command in October 1948. Korean War In August 1950 shortly after the start of the Korean War, Henderson was serving as Commander Fleet Air, Japan with added duty as Commander Naval Air Bases, Japan. Here he was responsible for supplying logistic support for operating squadrons, maintenance units, tenders and bases in the Japan-Korea area in an important contribution to the successful prosecution of the Korean Campaign. He assumed command of Carrier Division 5 in May 1951 and as Commander of Task Force 77 during operations in Korea from May to August 1951. With his flag in , his task force exerted relentless pressure against the enemy, provided effective close air support for ground troops, inflicted extensive damage upon the enemy by daring air strikes, and constantly interdicted their key communication systems. In October 1951 he served as Commander of Naval Air Bases, 11th & 12th Naval Districts headquartered in San Diego, California, and in May 1953 assumed additional duties as Commandant of the Eleventh Naval District, remaining at that post into September of that year. Retirement and death Henderson transferred to the Retired List of the Navy on August 1, 1954 as a rear admiral, designator 1313. He was advanced to rank of vice admiral on the basis of combat awards, after 37 years of naval service in 3 wars. Among his awards were the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit (6) with combat V‚Äôs, the Purple Heart, and Presidential Unit Citation. He died on November 29, 1964 at the age of 71. Vice Admiral Henderson was one of two World War II naval aviator admirals to have gone from seaman to admiral.

The screenplay concerns survivors of a nuclear holocaust, who do what they can to protect themselves against ravagers, a mutated group of vicious marauders who terrorize the few remaining civilized inhabitants. Plot In the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, animal-like creatures known as \\"the ravagers\\" roam the earth and kill all survivors. A man named Falk (Richard Harris) witnesses his wife's murder by the creatures. Seeking vengeance, Falk becomes a vigilante. He joins a small community, led by Rann (Ernest Borgnine), living aboard a ship anchored off shore. The ship is destroyed in an attack by the ravagers.

Her painting combines two different artistic styles: surrealism and na√Øve art. She was the daughter of the art collector Peggy Guggenheim and the writer Laurence Vail, and the granddaughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who died on the RMS Titanic in 1912.  Life  Pegeen Vail Guggenheim was born as Pegeen Jezebel Margaret Vail in Ouchy, Switzerland and spent her childhood in France and England. In 1941, she left Europe for the United States with her mother, Peggy Guggenheim and Max Ernst, who would later become her stepfather. While in the United States, she studied at the prestigious Finch College. In 1943, she met the French painter Jean H√©lion, who, along with his friends Piet Mondrian and Fernand L√©ger, helped introduce abstract art in the United States. Guggenheim married H√©lion in New York in 1946. The couple moved to Paris the same year. They had three children together: Fabrice, David, and Nicolas H√©lion. When they divorced in 1956, Pegeen left Paris with her youngest son, Nicolas, to live with her mother in Venice. In 1957, Guggenheim met the English painter Ralph Rumney in London at the opening of a Francis Bacon exhibition at the Hanover Gallery. Rumney was an English New Realist and one of the founders, along with Guy Debord and Piero Simondo, of the Situationist International. Guggenheim married Rumney in 1958 and gave birth to her fourth son, Sandro Rumney, the same year. In 1959, the couple moved to Paris, where they lived first on the rue du Dragon and then on the √éle Saint-Louis. Guggenheim died in Paris on March 1, 1967, after overdosing on medication. She struggled all her life with depression. Art During her short career, Guggenheim exhibited her work in New York (including the Museum of Modern Art), Philadelphia, Paris, London, Venice, Padua, Murano, Palm Beach, Vicenza, Stockholm, Toronto and San Diego. Guggenheim befriended, and was inspired by, some of the greatest intellectuals and artists of the 20th century, including Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Andr√© Breton, Marcel Duchamp, and Jackson Pollock. Her painting combines two different artistic styles: surrealism and na√Øve art. She was especially inspired in her work by the Surrealist painters that surrounded her during her childhood, including Tanguy, with whom she exchanged some paintings, and Ernst, who was her stepfather for five years, from 1941 to 1946. Her work reflects their influence in the recurrence of improbable elements or situations in her decors or scenes, combined with her own, unique na√Øve style. In January 1943 and in June 1945, Guggenheim's work was featured in exhibitions dedicated to women: Exhibition by 31 Women, and then \\"The Women\\", at the Art of This Century gallery opened by Peggy Guggenheim in New York in October 1942. Her paintings were shown alongside works by Kay Sage, Leonora Carrington, Lee Krasner, Dorothea Tanning, and Frida Kahlo. In her painting, Guggenheim often represents couples and families that seem happy and affectionate. Given her tumultuous childhood with her mother, this theme likely represents her search for a stable family life. The characters in Guggenheim's paintings are often taken directly from her own world: we can identify her mother, her husbands, her children, and especially Guggenheim herself. While her work seems cheerful at first glance, a sense of isolation and suffering is often perceptible: a woman crying while giving birth, for example, or characters that are dehumanized. Raymond Queneau wrote the following introduction to one of her exhibition catalogues: \\"The world Pegeen creates is somehow more authentic than the real world because it seems closer to heaven on earth. No culpability tarnishes its colors or weighs upon its figures. After his expulsion, Adam with his pure heart traced perfect representations of vengeful bison on hidden cave walls. What was Eve doing? Probably listening to cries that she was guilty. But here, as Pr√©vert says: 'God has been expelled from heaven on earth' and it is 'the new season'. 'A fertile ground- a childlike moon- a hospitable sea- a smiling sun- at the edge of the water- girls embodying the spirit of the times.' Pegeen H√©lion belongs to this race of 'ambrosial children'.Raymond Queneau: preface to Pegeen H√©lion's exhibition catalogue at the Galeria del Corso.

Among these scripts are Sharada, Kharosthi, Greek (for the Bactrian language), and BrƒÅhmƒ´. For thousands of years, Afghanistan was inhabited by Indo-Aryan and Iranian peoples and thus all ancient documents, tracts, monuments and remains are of Hindu and Iranian origins. Later, Buddhism became the major force in Afghanistan and brought with it its own liturgical languages. Abundant archeological evidence in the form of inscriptions, numismatics and manuscripts has provided traces of the precursors of the contemporary Indo-Aryan Languages of Afghanistan such as Dardic languages. Sanskrit Recent Archeological unearthings of Sanskrit inscriptions attest to the prevalence of the Sanskrit alphabet in Afghanistan. Some later Sanskrit inscriptions in late Brahmi of about around the fifth to eighth centuries have also been found in Afghanistan in recent decades. Worthy of note are the Dilberjin fresco inscriptions (Drevniaia Baktriia); the Gardez inscriptions on an image of Ganesa; and the Uma Maheshvara image inscriptions from Tapa Skandar.

The \\"Brown House\\" also served as the HQ of the 1st SS Standarte. The 1st SS-Standarte was a regimental command of the Allgemeine-SS and one of the most important units in the General-SS order of battle. History The unit was formed on 1 August 1928. It was reorganized from previous Schutzstaffel (SS) units, known as SS-Gaus. Based in Munich, the 1st SS Standarte was charged with protection of top Nazi Party leaders, including Adolf Hitler. Its first commander was Josef \\"Sepp\\" Dietrich. For most of its existence, the command was known by the honor title \\"Julius Schreck\\". Schreck had been the co-commander of the first Stabswache bodyguard unit for Hitler in 1923 and later the first leader of the SS. By 1929, Hitler had re-formed a personal bodyguard unit known as the Stabswache, which would eventually become the nucleus of the future 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. At this stage, the Stabswache and the 1st SS Standarte were practically one and the same. By 1930, however, Dietrich began to be seen strictly as the commander of the Stabswache, with the day-to-day running of the 1st Standarte handled by then SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Heinrich H√∂flich. When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Dietrich traveled with the F√ºhrer to Berlin to set up a new SS-Guard for the German leader. It was mostly made up of men from the 1st SS-Standarte. The unit replaced the army guards assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Dietrich went on to command the new unit known as the \\"SS-Stabswache Berlin\\". Later it became known as the SS- Sonderkommando Berlin. In November 1933, the Sonderkommando received the title Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler (LAH). Finally, Himmler modified that title to Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) on 13 April 1934. In the summer of 1933, leadership of what remained of 1st Standarte in Munich was taken over by SS- Standartenf√ºhrer Emil W√§ckerle. By the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, the SS had solidified itself with new headquarters' in Berlin. The 1st SS Standarte lost most of its operational importance and became a unit attached to the Munich Nazi Party headquarters, known as the \\"Brown House\\" for which the SS was in charge of security. The next commander of the 1st SS Standarte, after the Night of the Long Knives, was Julian Scherner, later known as the SS and Police Leader of Krakau, who was depicted in the Steven Spielberg film Schindler's List. After Scherner's tour as the Standarte commander, leadership passed through two more leaders, until eventually command was assumed by SS- Standartenf√ºhrer Erich Buchmann, who held the command until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945.

The soils are highly vulnerable to leaching and erosion where stripped of plant cover. The rainy season lasts from March to November, with annual rainfall of over 3,500 mm. The northern part is drained by the Cross River and its tributaries. The southern parts are drained by the Calabar, Kwa and Korup rivers.

It is possible that at one time the region was home to more people, perhaps being depopulated due to its proximity to the slave trading center of Calabar, and that the forest may actually be fairly recent growth.

She was an abandoned toddler who was picked up off the street at two and half years of age and charged with begging. She was found guilty and was sent to an Industrial school in Clifden, Co Galway, and ordered to be detained there until her sixteenth birthday. She was then sent to work in a big house where she was assaulted and fell pregnant. She was sent to a mother and baby Home in Tuam, from where she was forcibly separated from her then one-year-old son John Paschal and Bridie was forcibly put into the Magdalene Laundry in Galway City as punishment for her sins. She remained incarcerated till she escaped 15 years later along with two other inmates, who fled to England. Meanwhile, John Paschal remained in the Children Home Tuam until he was six. He was then fostered out by a farming family in Williamstown, Co Galway which was to become the setting of his second book 'Eggshells & Broken Dreams,' years later. Aged sixteen, John Paschal was forced to seek work in England( Manchester). Later, he met his mother Bridie, briefly, in Northampton and later still he emigrated to Australia aged twenty three. Two years later he returned to the UK and Ireland. After marrying Julie and having three children, he re-established contact with his mother Bridie Rodgers, who had by then married and was living happily in England.

She was named after Sarushima Island, a small island in Tokyo Bay, offshore Yokosuka, Kanagawa. She was designed as an auxiliary minelayer and escort vessel. Building The Maru 1 Supplementary Naval Expansion Budget of 1931 authorized the construction of the huge minelayer as well as three smaller minelayers for coastal and river service, the and as well as Sarushima. Sarushima was a slightly enlarged version of the Natsushima-class, with the same armament, but with diesel engines. Sarushima was launched by the Mitsubishi Yokohama shipyards on December 16, 1933, and was commissioned into service on July 20, 1934. Operational history On completion, Sarushima was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District. After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, she was dispatched to patrol the inland waters of China, and was based at Jiujiang under the China Expeditionary Fleet on July 1, 1938. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Sarushima was assigned to the Yokosuka Guard District, remaining in Japanese home waters for most of the duration of the war, and occasionally escorting convoys to the Bonin Islands. On April 15, 1944, Sarushima departed Tokyo with a convoy for Saipan, returning safety on May 4. On May 17, she departed with another convoy for Saipan and Guam. During the return leg of the voyage, the convoy was attacked on June 2 by (which sank one transport), and on June 4 by (which sank another). Sarushima launched depth charges, but failed to sink either submarine. On June 28, Sarushima escorted a convoy from Tokyo to Chichijima in the Bonin Islands. On the return voyage, the convoy was attacked by United States Navy (USN) carrier-based aircraft, which sunk all of the ships in the convoy, including Sarushima at position . Sarushima was removed from the Navy List on September 10, 1944.

Adam Barlow Adam Barlow is the son of Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) and Susan Barlow (Joanna Foster). The role was originated by child actor Iain De Caestecker in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but upon the character's return in 2004 he was recast with former model, Sam Robertson. Robertson reprised the role in November 2016. In November 2016, on his return to Weatherfield, Adam is caught in Underworld by Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) and Aiden Connor (Shayne Ward). He, Peter and his aunt Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) visit Ken in hospital after he suffered a stroke. There, they meet Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard), who reveals he is Ken's son. Adam joins his family for a meal and defends Tracy against Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). Adam gets revenge on Robert by calling environmental health. Daniel is suspected of stealing Adam's car when Tracy and Adam visit his flat and find student debts. Adam spends the night with Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon). Todd Grimshaw Todd James Grimshaw is a fictional character from the long-running soap opera, Coronation Street. He made his first appearance on 14 January 2001, and is played by Bruno Langley. He is the son of Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and brother of Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), both of whom made their first appearances in 2000. Todd is perhaps best known for his relationship with Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), before realizing that he was actually gay. Todd left the soap in 2004, but made two brief returns in 2007 and 2011. He returned to Coronation Street, as a regular, from November 2013 to December 2017. Sunita Alahan Sunita Alahan (n√©e Parekh) is a fictional character from the long-running ITV soap opera, Coronation Street. She is the wife of Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) and mother to Aadi (Zennon Ditchett) and Asha Alahan (Tanisha Gorey). Sunita's storylines have included: escaping an arranged marriage, being diagnosed with a brain tumour and an aneurysm, falsely imprisoned, being held hostage, falling pregnant with twins, becoming a single parent after divorcing her husband Dev, surviving an almighty tram crash, embarking on an affair with Karl Munro (John Michie), becoming trapped inside The Rovers Return Inn fire and later dying in hospital of a cardiac arrest caused by Karl. Jayesh Parekh Jayesh Parekh is the brother of Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) and followed her to Coronation Street in March 2001 when she fled her family and their attempt to force her into an arranged marriage in India. Sunita worked for Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) in his shop in Swinton and turned to her employer in her hour of need. Dev housed her in the Corner Shop flat and denied knowing her whereabouts when visited by her parents Suresh and Mena. Jayesh though was less trusting of Dev's innocence and parked himself outside the shop, seeing the curtains in the windows of the flat twitching. He confronted Dev who told him that the flat was used for stock and an employee was up there working. When Jayesh hammered on the door to the flat, it was Deirdre Rachid who answered the door and she joined in the deception, however the fugitive's brother was unconvinced by the stories he was being given and left Sunita's photo in the Rovers asking to be contacted should anyone see her. A couple of days later, Jeyesh returned with a friend and they pushed their way into the flat, trying to physically force Sunita to return with them. Dev threatened the police and brother and sister sat down calmly to talk. Jayesh himself had entered into an unarranged marriage which had failed and Sunita took this as evidence that this was why he was on the side of their parents' plans. Jayesh warned her that his parents would turn their back on her and he would have no choice but to support them. Sunita ended up having no contact with her family for over three years. By September 2004, Dev and Sunita's friendship had developed into love and the two were engaged. The thought of her upcoming wedding prompted Sunita to ring her mother but the phone was put down on her. It did prompt Jayesh to visit the Street though and the ice between brother and sister was quickly broken. He revealed that he had married for a second time - arranged this time as per cultural tradition - to Rhea Gujarati and the year before they had had a daughter. However he warned a tearful Sunita that her name was a forbidden word at home and that she was dead to her parents. Nevertheless, he tried to intercede on her behalf with her father and he agreed to meet his daughter in a local park but failed to turn up on that occasion. A month later, Jayesh returned and Sunita met her niece Jaya for the first time but she was upset when Jayesh made it clear that he wouldn't be attending the wedding and that the family did not approve of Dev. Dev walked in on the middle of their argument and he managed (with the help of a few glasses of whiskey) into talking Jayesh into being there for his sister at the wedding. He did turn up as promised and brought with him an extra surprise - Sunita's parents. Mena's initially frosty countenance disappeared and she and her husband joined in with the Hindu rituals but there was a self-declared spectre at the feast: Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), Dev's previous fianc√©e, intent of revenge for being dropped by him, had carried out an elaborate plan of impersonating Sunita and taking part in six sham marriages to illegal immigrants in her name, followed by a tip-off to the police. They arrested the happy couple and although Dev was released after questioning, Sunita was refused bail and imprisoned on remand pending trial. Jayesh and Mena visited Sunita in jail and from their attitude, made it clear that they suspected Dev of being guilty and not Maya who they had met and found \\"charming\\". Jayesh was last seen in February 2006 when, following the birth of his twin nephew and niece, Aadi and Asha, Sunita decided to leave Dev. Jayesh came and picked her and the twins up in his car and drove them away. Jayesh did not attend Sunita's funeral in April 2013 nor did the rest of her family, as they believed that Sunita started the fire at The Rovers Return, killing herself and a firefighter Toni Griffiths (Tara Moran), bringing shame on the family. However, the real culprit was actually Sunita's former lover, Karl Munro (John Michie). Fiz Brown Fiona \\"Fiz\\" Stape (n√©e Brown) is a fictional character from the long-running soap opera, Coronation Street. She is played by Jennie McAlpine, and made her first on-screen appearance on 20 April 2001. Fiz first appeared as the foster child of Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), aged 15. Fiz was only supposed to appear for 5 episodes, but McAlpine's contract was extended and Fiz became a regular character. Fiz was eventually involved in a murder storyline in which her lover, John Stape (Graeme Hawley), committed three murders and Fiz helped him dispose of the bodies. She gave birth in the live 50th anniversary episode, with McAlpine becoming the first actress in soap to give birth live. Shelley Unwin Shelley Victoria Unwin (previously Barlow) is a fictional character from the long-running soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Sally Lindsay. She made her first appearance on 9 May 2001. Shelley's storylines have included a marriage to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and an abusive and controlling relationship with Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward), who later left her pregnant. Her mother was Bev Unwin, played by Susie Blake respectively. Shelley left the street in 2006, making her last appearance on 29 September 2006. Richard Hillman Richard Charles Hillman is a fictional character from the long-running soap opera, Coronation Street. He was played by Brian Capron, and made his first appearance on 20 June 2001. He is first seen attending his cousin Alma Halliwell's (Amanda Barrie) funeral after she died from cervical cancer. He then began a relationship with Alma's best friend Gail Platt (Helen Worth) and the two were soon married on 28 July 2002. By then, Richard had become the show's main antagonist - as his character was developed into being a serial killer. Throughout the duration of his story arc, Richard left his business partner Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die after witnessing him fall through a banister; murders his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion) with a shovel; kidnap Gail's friend Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) to stop him from investigating the truth about his financially bankrupt property company, \\"Kellett Holdings\\"; sets his mother-in-law Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) house on fire before going on to convince her that she has Alzheimer's disease; and attempts to kill Norris' roommate Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) with a crowbar for money ‚Äî but ends up killing local landlady Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) and subsequently framed his stepdaughter's ex-boyfriend Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) for her murder. The character ultimately confessed his crimes to Gail in a two-handler episode on 24 February 2003 and soon departed from the show on 14 March 2003; Richard drove himself and his step-family into a canal after abducting them in a last- ditch familicide attempted, but they survived whilst he himself drowned and was later pronounced dead. Gary Adams Gary Adams, portrayed by Samuel Kane, was a man who posed as a 19-year-old boy, talking to Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), then aged 14, through an internet chatroom. When Sarah starts to talk to strangers on the internet as a way of meeting new people, she talks to a boy called Gary who claims to be 19 years old. Gary and Sarah quickly befriend each other after they share common interests and she becomes smitten by him. After Gary requests Sarah to call him, she agrees to meet him for the first time. However, when Sarah goes to his house, she is greeted by an older man in his early 30s who claims to be Gary's father which surprises her. The man later confesses to Sarah that he is actually Gary. He justifies to an angry and a disappointed Sarah as being a lonely man who has no close family and friends. Although she rejects him, Sarah empathises with Gary and opens up to him about being a teenage mother to her baby daughter Bethany which causes many problems at home including the separation of her mother Gail (Helen Worth) and adoptive father Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) due to Martin's recent infidelity. Gail and Martin learn about Sarah's arrangement and visits Gary. They both eventually leave after Gary lies to them that he has never seen Sarah whilst Sarah herself hides from them. Gary and Sarah continue their day and he tells her that she is the only girl he has only ever met from chatrooms as he is convinced that they have a special connection. Sarah begins to worry about Gary's behaviour and his intentions and calls her friend Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) to collect her. However Gary locks her in his bedroom when Candice's boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) arrive; Candice and Todd then try to rescue her. A frightened Sarah realises she is in danger with Gary and tries to escape but he refuses to let her leave. Gary confronts Todd who enters into the house after Candice manages to break a back door window, but Todd injures himself on Gary's fireplace. Gail arrives with her neighbour Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale) after calling the police and they save Sarah. Dennis then punches Gary repeatedly and insults him. Gary is then taken into custody by the police but he presses charges against Dennis for assault. The police tell Gail that Gary has been charged with false imprisonment but was promptly released on bail, which disgusts and angers Gail. The following month, the police inform Gail that they wouldn't be pressing any charges against Gary. Christie Wells Christie Wells, portrayed by Lauren Drummond, was a teenage girl who was supposedly having an affair with sixteen year old Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley). Todd had a failed attempt to have an affair with his then girlfriend Candice Stowe's (Nikki Sanderson) best friend Sarah- Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), so he asked Christie to the disco to get Sarah jealous. However, he seemed to get Christie jealous instead when Christie made jealous remarks at Sarah, causing Sarah to threaten to tell Candice what Todd was trying to do. Ranjiv Alahan Ranjiv Alahan is the father of Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) who first appeared in October 2001 and was played by Raad Rawi. Ranjiv first appears when Dev introduces his parents to his fianc√©e, Geena Gregory (Jennifer James). The character reappeared in February 2004, this time played by Madhav Sharma. Dev's current fianc√©e Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), arranges a meeting between her, Dev and Ranjiv in a restaurant in order to introduce herself to Ranjiv, who is impressed with Maya, who works as a lawyer. Ranjiv congratulates his son for his choice of partner. DS Tony Trafford Detective Sergeant Tony Trafford was a local police officer. Trafford is first seen when Eve Elliott (Melanie Kilburn) reports the disappearance of her daughter Linda Baldwin (Jacqueline Pirie) to the police. Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) accompanies Eve to the police station and tells Trafford that he witnessed Linda's husband Mike (Johnny Briggs) hit her. Trafford is initially unconcerned by the report but four days later Linda's car is discovered in a River and Trafford concludes the car was dumped there deliberately and he and his colleagues take the case more seriously, particularly when one of Linda's shoes is discovered in the car. Trafford questions Mike about her disappearance and Mike insists he does not know of her whereabouts and that he had last seen her when she had visited their flat to collect her passport. Linda's brother Ryan (Matthew Dunster) later tells Trafford that he believes Mike killed her as she had had an affair with businessman Harvey Reuben (Andrew Scarborough). Trafford later questions Mike again at the police station and tells him that they know about Linda's affair. Mike's flat is searched and Linda's passport is found and Mike tells Trafford that he had lied about when he had last seen Linda to stop people from gossiping. Trafford then arrests Mike on suspicion of murder. Mike is held overnight and questioned more the following day but Trafford is forced to release him due to a lack of evidence. Trafford later arranges for Mike to take part in an identity parade. In February 2002, Trafford investigates the death of Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe). He questions Richard (Brian Capron) and Gail Hillman (Helen Worth) who discovered Duggie's body and informs them that they believe Duggie's death was an accident. Trafford is last seen in January 2003, investigating the murder of Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Trafford conducts door to door enquiries with the local residents, asking them if they saw anything suspicious. Richard, who is Maxine's killer, implicates Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) as a potential suspect. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) then tells Trafford that he had seen a light in an abandoned hardware shop nearby. Trafford leads a raid on the premises, which it is discovered that Aiden has been using as a squat. Items stolen from the Peacocks' house, planted by Richard, are discovered in Aiden's possession and Trafford arrests Aiden. Trafford is last seen questioning Aiden's ex-girlfriend Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) and she confirms that Aiden had alcohol with him in the squat, backing up his claims that he was too drunk to remember anything. Sarah also tells Trafford that she doesn't believe Aiden is a murderer.

However, the station is located within the adjacent municipality of Muralto, near the shore of Lake Maggiore. The border between the two municipalities runs along the Torrente Ramogna stream, a short distance to the south and west of the station. Since 1990, Locarno station has been divided into two distinct components, each served by a separately operated railway. At surface level, there is a standard gauge station, operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). That station is the terminal of a branch line from Giubiasco on the Gotthard Railway. Underground, there is another terminal station, for the metre gauge Domodossola‚ÄìLocarno railway, an international rail link operated in Switzerland by the Regional Bus and Rail Company of Canton Ticino (). Before the station was renovated into this form, the metre gauge trains operated from a separate platform on the station forecourt. As part of the reconstruction, the standard gauge station was augmented by a new finger platform between tracks two and three.

The park is about north west of Benin City. The park holds a small fragment of the rich forest that once covered the region, and is the last habitat for many endangered species. It continues to shrink as villages encroach on it, and is now less than one third of its original size. Powerful corporations are involved in plantation development and logging concessions around the park, which also pose a threat. History The park holds a remnant of the Nigerian lowland forests that once formed a continuous wide belt from the Niger River west to the Dahomey Gap in Benin. To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure is not new. In the Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By the start of the 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. Khaya senegalensis, or African mahogany. This specimen is growing further inland, near Mount Tenakourou, Burkina Faso, in a savannah region. The wildlife sanctuary, a rainforest ecosystem that is the habitat for many endangered species of flora and fauna, was gazetted from the Okomu Forest Reserve in 1935. A survey of southwestern forests in Nigeria in 1982 led to a recommendation for a determined effort to conserve the sanctuary. The state government formally defined the sanctuary in 1986, with an area of just 66 km2. The Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) took over management of the sanctuary in 1987, and extended it to by adding a buffer zone. The NCF was diverted into assisting migrant farmers in the surrounding areas, in an attempt to help the villagers find alternative means of living without encroaching on the forest. The NCF agricultural initiatives had the perverse effect of attracting immigrants from poorer areas, and thus increasing the pressure from illegal hunting and logging. In 1997 it was also found that several NCF employees had been involved in illegal logging within the sanctuary. In May 1999 the sanctuary was taken over by the National Park Service. Environment The park is drained by the Osse River which defines its eastern boundary. The Okomu River forms the western boundary. Rainfall is between 1,524 and 2,540 mm per year. Soils are acidic, nutrient-poor sandy loam. Vegetation is Guinea‚ÄìCongo lowland rain forest, including areas of swamp-forest, high forest, secondary forest, and open scrub. Among the common trees are Kapok, Celtis zenkeri, Triplochiton scleroxylon, Antiaris africana, Pycnanthus angolensis and Alstonia congoensis. The park is probably the best example of mature secondary forest in southwest Nigeria. The park is accessible to tourists, and has well marked trails. There are two tree houses, one 140 feet high in a silk-cotton tree, from which visitors can view the park from above and observe bird life. Visitors can stay at chalets built on stilts, just outside the park entrance, surrounded by fig trees that are often occupied by Mona monkeys. Guides are available for forest walks, and will point out such things as termite nests and the many medicinal plants. Fauna African Forest Elephant The park has diverse fauna, with 33 species of mammals including the African buffalo and the endangered African forest elephant. Elephant sightings are rare, although in 2007 a one-year-old elephant carcass was found, unlikely to have died from natural causes. Park officials claim that elephant poaching no longer occurs, despite the high prices commanded for ivory in Lagos. There is a population of the vulnerable white-throated guenon, a primate. Although no thorough study of the primate population has been done since 1982, chimpanzees were reported to be present in the region in 2009. The number of chimpanzees estimated to live in the Okomu Forest reserve was guessed to be 25‚Äì50 in 2003, and some may use the national park at times. Other animals found in the park include dwarf crocodiles, red river hog, sitatunga, warthog, civet cat, Maxwell's duiker, grass cutter, mona monkey, Thomas's galago and tree pangolin. About 150 species of birds have been identified. These include Angolan pitta, grey parrot, wrinkled hornbill, fish eagle, hawks, woodpeckers, great owl, grey hornbill, cattle egret, black-casqued hornbill, yellow-casqued hornbill, Sabine's spinetail, Cassin's spinetail, black spinetail, white-breasted negrofinch, chestnut-breasted negrofinch, pale-fronted negrofinch and yellow- throated cuckoo. Terrestrial molluscs seem exceptionally vulnerable to extinction, and low diversity may indicate subtle environmental problems. A survey of land molluscs in a small area of the forest found 46 species in 11 molluscan families, of which Streptaxidae snails accounted for over a third. This is much lower diversity than has been found in Cameroon and Sabah. However, it may be due to the very limited sample in just one area. Perhaps of greater interest to most visitors, the park has over 700 species of colourful butterflies. Threats Visitors must follow strict regulations to avoid degrading the environment. However, the park is threatened by large-scale illegal logging, the expansion of large rubber and oil-palm plantations nearby, and incursions by a growing human population involved in farming and hunting. In 2009, the Executive Director of LifeTag, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in Lagos, called for urgent action by the Edo State government to prevent further illegal encroachment and destructive logging activities in the park, which both threaten the rare species and will destroy the long-term revenue to be earned from eco-tourism. The Federal government has said that it is eager to partner with foreign investors to develop eco- tourism in Okomu and other National Parks. In October 2010, representatives of the park's management met with leaders from the seven major communities bordering the park and established a Local Advisory Committee. The conservator of the park, Mohammed Yakubu Kolo, said the committee was to \\"provide a platform for the park management and the local communities to work together on issues of mutual interest, in order to achieve the park's set-goals.\\" He went on to say \\"The establishment of LAC for Okomu Park is the most significant move ever made to guarantee the continuous protection of its diverse rich biological resources and splendour\\". A forestry officer said the move would help the communities work together to stop poaching. The protected area of the Okomu National Forest is too small and too vulnerable. Without further efforts to improve protection, it is unlikely that the forest will remain viable long into the future.

At its launch it was the first new high street bank to launch in the United Kingdom in over 150 years. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. After a period of rapid growth, Metro Bank hit difficulties in early 2019 when it announced it had insufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, following the discovery of an error in the way it categorised its commercial loans for capital adequacy purposes. As a result, it had to raise an additional ¬£350m of capital. Concerns over the announcement and the bank's ability to raise the capital resulted in the bank's share price falling by 75% in less than four months, and large depositors withdrawing cash, because of \\"adverse sentiment\\".  History  Metro Bank was granted its licence by the Financial Services Authority on 5 March 2010, the first high-street bank to be granted such a licence for over 150 years. It planned to open between 200 and 250 branches in Greater London within ten years of starting up. Its first branch opened on 29 July 2010 in Holborn, central London. In 2012, the bank raised an additional $200 million in funding from investors including Fidelity, Steven A. Cohen of hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, and New York real estate investors the LeFraks and David and Simon Reubens. In the same year, Forbes magazine reported that Metro's flagship Holborn branch had \\"...garnered $200 million in deposits, four times the total at the average mature American branch\\". On 2 May 2013 the Daily Telegraph reported that, following a loss of ¬£8.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, Metro Bank's pre-tax losses had exceeded ¬£100 million in less than three years since its launch, but the bank stated that these were planned for, and were \\"a result of its growth initiatives\\". In an interview with the Financial Times, Hill said the bank was \\"...in line with the business plan to rapidly grow this company\\". He added: \\"Our primary goal is to expand the business ... and profit certainly will come\\". Metro Bank increased its account holders by 50% in the first half of 2013 for a total of 200,000 customer accounts, including 15,000 business accounts. It was aiming to have 200 UK branches open by 2020. In January 2019, Metro Bank admitted classifying a portfolio of commercial loans for capital purposes incorrectly, thereby failing to hold sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements; the error applied to around 10% of its loan book. The miscalculation was identified through a review by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but Metro Bank erroneously gave the impression that the bank had identified the incorrect classification itself. To correct the error in the capital classification, Metro Bank announced a ¬£350m share issue and said it would reduce its growth plans. It was also reported that the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority were to investigate the circumstances of the error. As a result of the admission and the share issue announcement, Metro Bank's share price fell sharply, losing 40% of its value in the month after the announcement and 75% in less than four months. By March 2019, the BBC reported that Metro Bank shares were the second most shorted shares on the UK stock market. Additionally, large depositors began withdrawing funds: Metro Bank admitted that there had been a 4% drop in its deposits in the first quarter of 2019 because of \\"adverse sentiment\\".  Services  A Metro Bank debit card, credit card and cheque book issued in 2011 Metro Bank provides banking services to personal and business customers. It is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  Acquisitions  Metro Bank acquired SME Finance in August 2013, and rebranded the business as Metro Bank SME Finance in May 2014. It was announced in August 2020 that Metro Bank had agreed to acquire Retail Money Market Ltd, a London-based provider of peer-to-peer loans trading as RateSetter. The price would be between ¬£2.5 million and ¬£12 million, depending on performance over the next three years. The purchase was subject to regulatory approval and the agreement of RMM shareholders, and was expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2020. Metro Bank would continue the RateSetter brand and its operations, but new unsecured personal lending would be funded by the bank's deposits, not through peer-to-peer.  Management Hill received the Institute of Economic Affairs‚Äô Free Enterprise Award in April 2013. The organisation cited him as \\"a remarkable entrepreneur who has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire\\". Craig Donaldson, the Chief Executive Officer, started his career on the Barclays graduate scheme in 1995. Later he worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland where he met Hill. Together they decided to set up a UK equivalent to Commerce Bancorp, and this idea grew into Metro Bank. In 2015, Michael Snyder joined Metro Bank's board with a view to developing Metro Bank's small business lending operations. In October 2019, Hill stood down as Chairman. He was replaced by Sir Michael Snyder who was appointed Interim Chairman. Craig Donaldson stepped down as CEO in December 2019. Daniel Frumkin replaced him as Interim CEO.

In symbols, the major index of the permutation w is : \\\\operatorname{maj}(w) = \\\\sum_{w(i)>w(i+1)} i. For example, if w is given in one-line notation by w = 351624 (that is, w is the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that w(1) = 3, w(2) = 5, etc.) then w has descents at positions 2 (from 5 to 1) and 4 (from 6 to 2) and so maj(w) = 2 + 4 = 6. This statistic is named after Major Percy Alexander MacMahon who showed in 1913 that the distribution of the major index on all permutations of a fixed length is the same as the distribution of inversions. That is, the number of permutations of length n with k inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length n with major index equal to k. (These numbers are known as Mahonian numbers, also in honor of MacMahon.M. B√≥na, Combinatorics of Permutations, 2004, p. 43ff, .) In fact, a stronger result is true: the number of permutations of length n with major index k and i inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length n with major index i and k inversions, that is, the two statistics are equidistributed.

The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them. Web-based PRM systems typically include a Content Management System, a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a vendor's sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. This helps vendors to streamline processes, as well as to collect and assess data about various stages of the partner sales funnel. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software to companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries. Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead, automate regular processes, and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale. Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers. Unlike CRM systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf. As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include: * MDF Request Programs * Training, Certification, and Accreditation Automation * Deal Registration Programs * Indirect Sales Pipeline Reporting * Joint Business Planning * Reward and Loyalty Programs * Content Library Trends Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.https://www.gartner.com/technology/media- products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.https://www.gartner.com/technology/media- products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html Forrester reports, ‚Äú[t]he PRM market is growing because more executive teams, as well as channel, marketing, and sales professionals, are recognizing the impact of third-party influencers in getting to new buyers.

He served in the US Army in the Air Defense Command. He attended the University of Houston beginning in 1962 and studied physics. He began working at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) before graduating from college.  Early career  Kessler was a flight controller for Skylab, the US space station launched by NASA on November 11th, 1973.  Career  Kessler worked at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as part of NASA's Environmental Effects Project Office.. While there, he developed what is now known as the Kessler syndrome, which posits that collisions between space debris become increasingly likely as the density of space debris increases in orbit around the earth, and a cascade effect results as each collision in turn creates more debris that can cause further collisions. Kessler first published his ideas in 1978, in an academic paper titled \\"Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt.\\" The paper established Kessler's reputation, and NASA subsequently made him the head of the newly created Orbital Debris Program Office to study the issue and establish guidelines to slow the accumulation of space debris. Kessler retired from NASA in 1996, and has maintained a website with his publications and contact information. He currently lives in Asheville, North Carolina. He continues to be active in the field of orbital debris. In 2009, he gave an address to the first International Conference on Orbital Debris Removal in Arlington, Virginia, co- sponsored by NASA and DARPA. In 2011, he was a key adviser in the making of the educational IMAX film Space Junk 3D and also served as chairman of a United States National Research Council committee to assess NASA's orbital debris programs.

Henry went to Holland, where he was apprenticed to his uncle, the painter Thomas de Keyser. He later went on a tour of the continent with his brother Nicholas Jr. visiting France, and Italy to study art, and returned in 1642. After his father's death he and his youngest brother John carried on their father's business of masonry and statuary. Stone was, however, chiefly known as a portrait painter, and was an excellent copyist of the works of Van Dyck and the Italian Masters. He also published a short work on painting, called \\"The Third Part of the Art of Painting\\". Stone inherited his father's house and workyard in Long Acre, London and died there on 24 August 1653. He was buried on 27 August near his father in St. Martin's Church, and on his inscription it is stated that he had passed the greatest part of thirty-seven years in Holland, France, and Italy.

The highest ice rink above street-level in the United States, it is located on the eighth floor atop the parking garage adjoining the Ballston Quarter in the Ballston neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. Opened in 2006, the facility, which is owned by Arlington County and leased to the Capitals, houses two full-NHL-sized ice rinks with seating for 1,200, a training center, a proshop, and offices for staff of both the Capitals team and the WNBA's Washington Mystics team. The Capitals spend about 300 hours annually practicing at the arena, which has 12,000 hours of ice time available annually. The Iceplex also serves as the home ice for the club teams of Georgetown University and George Washington University. The Iceplex also runs an adult league for amateur hockey players. It is regularly available for recreational use, and hosts \\"Learn to Skate\\" camps and lessons throughout the year. The IcePlex is also home to the NOVA Cool Cats special hockey team, which practices and has home games at the IcePlex, and the DC Sled Sharks, a sledge hockey team for physically disabled youths 18 and under, which plays in the Delaware Valley Sled Hockey League. The IcePlex served as the initial inspiration for the building of LECOM Harborcenter in Buffalo, New York by the Buffalo Sabres and Terrence Pegula. LECOM Harborcenter serves a similar purpose to the IcePlex. History The Capitals had long practiced at a rink in Piney Orchard, Maryland, near the Capital Centre, even after the team moved to downtown Washington, D.C. in 1997. Arlington County, Virginia had purchased the parking garage at the Parkington Shopping Center in 1984 as part of an economic development plan in the Ballston area. The facility was subsequently renamed the Ballston Public Parking Garage, and the original 1950‚Äôs structure was renovated and expanded to provide 2,800 parking spaces on seven floors. This expansion was financed with $22.3 million in variable rate revenue bond. Ted Leonsis, who bought the Capitals in 1999, began looking to build a new practice facility and in 2004, the team secured agreements with Arlington County to build a new rink on top of the Ballston Public Parking Garage. The building was designed by William R. Drury of the Reston, Virginia based firm, Architecture, Incorporated, and completed in November 2006 at a cost of $42.8 million. It is built to LEED standards, though was not registered with the Green Building Council to receive a certification. It is not fully handicapped accessible. The facility totals 137,000 square-feet and includes two indoor NHL-sized ice rinks, office space, 8 player locker rooms, a full-service ProShop, a Capitals Team Store, a snack bar, and spaces for special events. In addition, it includes a 20,000 square foot training center for the Capitals, containing an athletic-training and medical facilities, a weight room and fitness room, a locker room and lounge area, a high-tech theatre-style classroom and a video room. An additional level, above the training facility, houses office space for the entire front-office staff of the Capitals and the WNBA‚Äôs Washington Mystics. Originally named Ballston Ice Arena, it was renamed Kettler Capitals Iceplex by Washington, D.C. area real estate developer Robert C. Kettler. His firm, KSI Services, bought the naming rights to the arena on November 1, 2006, for seven years at $400,000 per year. The arena opened with its first practice 10 days later. In 2010, the Arlington County Board recognized the facility in the inaugural DESIGNArlington awards. The facility continued to bear Kettler's name until weeks after the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup in 2018, when MedStar Health bought the naming rights in a 10-year agreement together with the other Monumental Sports & Entertainment practice facilities.

After the Fall of France in June 1940, the British Government made urgent anti-invasion preparations as the Royal Air Force (RAF) engaged the German Luftwaffe in a struggle for air superiority in the Battle of Britain. In May 1940, the Air Ministry had realised that beyond the normal reserves of the RAF, it may be necessary to throw every serviceable aircraft into the battle. On 17 May, an Air Ministry meeting outlined ambitious plans to make use of various aircraft in the event of an invasion.The National Archives: AIR 14/1126 ‚Äì Operation \\"Banquet\\": scheme to employ all available training aircraft in defence of UK against invasion  Plan  On 13 July 1940, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Training Command was ordered to plan to make the maximum practical number of aircraft available for operations. The plan was called Operation Banquet and was divided into several operations that could be enacted independently. In Banquet 6 Group, Bomber Command decided to use the aircraft of 6 Group (the Group Pool units, not the later Royal Canadian Air Force) as conventional replacements in the front-line squadrons. Banquet 22 Group would move certain 22 Group (Army Cooperation) aircraft into conventional Bomber Command squadrons. Somewhat desperate were Banquet Alert which called for the employment of Fleet Air Arm training aircraft under Coastal Command and Banquet Training which called for the absorption of aircraft from RAF Training Command into the operational striking force of Bomber Command. Aircraft allocated under Banquet would, in many cases, lack bombsights, armour protection, guns and self-sealing fuel tanks. While these were to be fitted where possible, RAF instructions made it clear that no aircraft was to be considered unfit for want of such niceties; anything that could fly and drop bombs would suffice. Early in July, about 1,000 aircraft, from Tiger Moths to Wellington bombers, at training schools, were ready for anti-invasion operations, with hope of another 1,000 aircraft when the scheme was complete. The use of slow aircraft for ground attack operations was not without precedent, Netherlands Fokker C.Xs, German Henschel Hs 123 and British Hawker Hector biplanes had operated on the continent without unsustainable losses; against advanced troops without time to establish adequate air defences, slow, highly manoeuvrable aircraft could make accurate ground attacks and escape destruction. Ground crews would go with their aircraft and in some cases this would have involved civilian volunteers. The air crew for Banquet Alert and Training would be the experienced instructors as well as those students that had reached \\"a reasonably satisfactory standard of training\\". Few training schools were close to likely invasion areas and moving them seemed unwise in the chaos of an invasion, when closer airfields would have been bombed and were busy servicing their operational squadrons. It was decided to base four flights of 5‚Äì6 basic trainer aircraft to Army Cooperation, Coastal and Bomber command bases, two flights at first and two more if the base commander decided that they could be accommodated. The air bases were widely spread and no swarms of Banquet aircraft would have descended on the landing beaches, the main effort would be by conventional Bomber Command squadrons. Army Cooperation Command was instructed that, When to implement the Banquet scheme was kept open; if a German landing occurred away from the concentrations of the British army, such as Scotland, the scheme would be put into effect straight away but if a landing came where expected, the aircraft would be used as a last resort, dependent on how swiftly the situation deteriorated.  Banquet Light  Among the Banquet plans was Banquet Light which would see the formation of striking forces composed of De Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes and other light aircraft of Elementary Flying Training Schools. De Havilland put forward plans for converting the Tiger Moth into a bomber by equipping it with eight bomb racks beneath the rear cockpit. As an alternative, the bomb-racks could be installed four on each side under the lower planes, which would avoid trimming difficulties. The racks had been designed for the military version of the de Havilland Dragons supplied to Iraq eight years previously. Trials were conducted at Hatfield by Major Hereward de Havilland and at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down and the machines earned a satisfactory report. Tests were also carried out with a Tiger Moth carrying a bomb. Modification of the relatively small number of Miles Magister trainers were also attempted but this proved troublesome and Banquet Light mostly used Tiger Moths. The Banquet Light strike force would be used for Army co- operation, bombing concentrations of airborne troops or soldiers landing on the beaches. The two-seater Tiger Moth bombers should be flown solo into an attack at low altitude until the enemy was identified, climb to and dive to to release the bombs. Most of the pilots for Banquet Light would be students who had not yet graduated. The scheme required that trainee pilots should be introduced to bombing at an early stage in their instruction, in case they needed to go into action immediately. Instructors were told to \\"take every opportunity to carry out practice bombing\\". With no dummy bombs available early in 1940, training exercises were carried out with the aircraft flown from the front cockpit by instructors and house bricks were thrown over the side from the rear cockpit. It was discovered that the bricks fell slower than a diving Tiger Moth and instructions were given to throw the bricks forcefully away from the aircraft. About 350 aircraft were available but the Moths and their inexperienced pilots would have been vulnerable to enemy aircraft and the plan was widely regarded as suicidal.WO 199/2471 ‚Äì \\"Banquet\\" light scheme, The Catalogue, The National Archives Consideration was also given to adapting civilian aircraft for Banquet Civil but the idea was dropped.  Cancellation  Operation Banquet was never put into effect but was periodically exercised under various guises. One \\"exercise\\" provided secret cover for the temporary reorganisation needed for the first 1,000 bomber raid sent against the city of Cologne on the night of 30/31 May 1942. This plan required considerable reorganisation including the contribution of bombers from Coastal Command and Training Command. Banquet was cancelled in October 1943 having never been put into effect.

Cuba has an embassy located in Lima, Peru while Peru has an embassy in Havana, Cuba. History Relations between the South American states of Cuba and Peru have been troubled since the Cuban Revolution brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959. Like all other states in the Americas apart from Canada and Mexico, Peru broke off diplomatic relationships with the newly communist Cuba in the early 1960s. While diplomatic ties were re-established on 8 July 1972, under the dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado, the relationship has since been rocked by a succession of incidents. Tensions were aggravated by the Cold War, with Peru tending to side with the US, while Cuba was a loyal ally of the Soviet Union. A destabilizing factor specific to the bilateral relationship was the alleged Cuban support for the T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a terrorist group that operated in remote rural areas of Peru. The relationship remained rocky even after the cold war ended. An example incident followed Peru's support for a 2004 UN resolution critical of Cuba's human rights record. This prompted Fidel Castro to speak out strongly against Peru and her president, leading Peru to respond by recalling her ambassador. By 2010 the general improvement in Cuba's foreign relations that had followed the ascension of U.S. President Barack Obama had lost momentum. However both Cuba and Peru were quick to lay aside their differences as they co-operated in delivering humanitarian relief for victims of the 2010 Chile earthquake . =Mariel boatlift of 1980 = Embassy of Peru in Havana A small group of Cuban citizens took sanctuary at the Peruvian embassy by smashing through the perimeter fence in a bus. Cuba asked embassy officials to hand the Cubans over to Cuban security officials. Peru refused and the Cuban government responded by withdrawing the Cuban security officers who protected the embassy. About 10,000 Cubans then sought asylum at the embassy. Cuba then opened the port of Mariel and allowed Cubans who wanted to emigrate to leave by boat, prompting the exodus of approximately 125,000.

Nontheism has been applied and plays significant roles in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. While many approaches to religion exclude nontheism by definition, some inclusive definitions of religion show how religious practice and belief do not depend on the presence of god(s). For example, Paul James and Peter Mandaville distinguish between religion and spirituality, but provide a definition of the term that avoids the usual reduction to \\"religions of the book\\":  Buddhism  Buddha descending from TrƒÅyastri·πÉ≈õa Heaven. Palm leaf manuscript. Nalanda, Bihar, India gods ≈öakra (left) and BrahmƒÅ (right) = Existence of gods = The Buddha said that devas (translated as \\"gods\\") do exist, but they were regarded as still being trapped in samsara, and are not necessarily wiser than humans. In fact, the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the gods, and superior to them. Since the time of the Buddha, the denial of the existence of a creator deity has been seen as a key point in distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist views.B. Alan Wallace, Contemplative Science. Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97‚Äì98. The question of an independent creator deity was answered by the Buddha in the Brahmajala Sutta. The Buddha denounced the view of a creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of eternalism, and like the 61 other views, this belief causes suffering when one is attached to it and states these views may lead to desire, aversion and delusion. At the end of the Sutta the Buddha says he knows these 62 views and he also knows the truth that surpasses them. Later Buddhist philosophers also extensively criticized the idea of an eternal creator deity concerned with humanity.Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition =Metaphysical questions= On one occasion, when presented with a problem of metaphysics by the monk Malunkyaputta, the Buddha responded with the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow. When a man is shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison, his family summons a doctor to have the poison removed, and the doctor gives an antidote:  Christianity  Bust of Paul Tillich A few liberal Christian theologians define a \\"nontheistic God\\" as \\"the ground of all being\\" rather than as a personal divine being. Many of them owe much of their theology to the work of Christian existentialist philosopher Paul Tillich, including the phrase \\"the ground of all being\\". Another quotation from Tillich is, \\"God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him.\\"Tillich, Paul. (1951) Systematic Theology, p.205. This Tillich quotation summarizes his conception of God. He does not think of God as a being that exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself. From a nontheistic, naturalist, and rationalist perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as luck.Kaufman, Arnold S. \\"Ability\\", The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 60, No. 19 =Nontheist Quakers= Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends A nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms Quaker practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of God, a Supreme Being, the divine, the soul or the supernatural. Like theistic Friends, nontheist Friends are actively interested in realizing centered peace, simplicity, integrity, community, equality, love, happiness and social justice in the Society of Friends and beyond.  Hinduism  Hinduism is characterised by extremely diverse beliefs and practices.Catherine Robinson, Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord. Routledge Press, 1992, page 17. In the words of R.C. Zaehner, \\"it is perfectly possible to be a good Hindu whether one's personal views incline toward monism, monotheism, polytheism, or even atheism.\\"Catherine Robinson, Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord. Routledge Press, 1992, page 51. He goes on to say that it is a religion that neither depends on the existence or non-existence of God or Gods.R. C. Zaehner, (1966) Hinduism, P.1-2, Oxford University Press. More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, second that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third that is pluralistic and non-absolute. The latter two traditions can be seen as nontheistic.Griffiths, Paul J, (2005) Nontheistic Conceptions of the Divine Ch. 3. in The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion by William J Wainwright, p.59 . Oxford University Press US, One of the non-orthodox schools within Hinduism, the materialist and hedonistic Charvaka School, is atheistic and somewhat similar to Epicureanism. Although the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the Rig Veda mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). Max M√ºller termed this henotheism, and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.Masih, Y. A comparative study of religions, P.164, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000 The famous Nasadiya Sukta, the 129th Hymn of the tenth and final Mandala (or chapter) of the Rig Veda, considers creation and asks \\"The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. /Who then knows whence it has arisen?\\".O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, (1981)The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns (Classic) Penguin This can be seen to contain the intuition that there must be a single principle behind all phenomena: 'That one' (tad ekam), self-sufficient, to which distinctions cannot be applied.Collinson, Dian√© and Wilkinson, Robert Thirty-Five Oriental Philosophers, P. 39, Routledge, 1994 Mohanty, Jitendranath (2000), Classical Indian Philosophy: An Introductory Text, p:1 Rowman & Littlefield, It is with the Upanishads, reckoned to be written in the first millennia (coeval with the ritualistic Brahmanas), that the Vedic emphasis on ritual was challenged. The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins. Many of these were shramanas, who represented a non-Vedic tradition rooted in India's pre-Aryan history.Jaroslav Krejƒç√≠, Anna Krejƒçov√° (1990) Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East, p:170, SUNY Press, The emphasis of the Upanishads turned to knowledge, specifically the ultimate identity of all phenomena.Doniger, Wendy, (1990) Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, P. 441, Merriam-Webster, This is expressed in the notion of Brahman, the key idea of the Upanishads, and much later philosophizing has been taken up with deciding whether Brahman is personal or impersonal.Smart, Ninian (1998) The World's Religions P.73-74, CUP The understanding of the nature of Brahman as impersonal is based in the definition of it as 'ekam eva advitiyam' (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1) ‚Äì it is one without a second and to which no substantive predicates can be attached.Wainwright, William J. (2005) Ch.3 Nontheistic conceptions of the divine.

While the Sankhya and Mimamsa schools no longer have significant followings in India, they are both influential in the development of later schools of philosophy.Flood, Gavin D, An Introduction to Hinduism,(p.232) CUP, Larson, Gerald James,(1999) Classical Samkhya, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, The Yoga of Patanjali is the school that probably owes most to the Samkhya thought. This school is dualistic, in the sense that there is a division between 'spirit' (Sanskrit: purusha) and 'nature' (Sanskrit: prak·πõti).Feuerstein, Georg (1989), Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy, Tarcher, It holds Samadhi or 'concentrative union' as its ultimate goalKing, Richard (1999) Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought, p:191, Edinburgh University Press, and it does not consider God's existence as either essential or necessary to achieving this.Clements, Richard Pauranik, Being a Witness in Theory and Practice of Yoga by Knut A.

E., On Interpreting the \\"Bhagavadgƒ´tƒÅ\\", Philosophy East and West 32, no 1 (January 1982). Generally, the book as a whole has been interpreted by some who see it as containing a primarily nontheistic message,Catherine Robinson, Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord. Routledge Press, 1992, page 45, 98, 115, 136. and by others who stress its theistic message.Catherine Robinson, Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord. Routledge Press, 1992, pages 47, 51. These broadly either follow after either Sankara or RamanujaFlood, Gavin D, An Introduction to Hinduism, (pps 239-234) CUP, An example of a nontheistic passage might be \\"The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being,\\" which Sankara interpreted to mean that Brahman can only be talked of in terms of negation of all attributes‚Äî'Neti neti'.Swami Gambhirananda, (1995), Bhagavadgita: with the Commentary of Sankaracharya, Ch. 13. Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta The Advaita Vedanta of Gaudapada and Sankara rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is \\"Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He.\\"Richards, John, Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara Vs 468. This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.Wainright, William, (2006), Concepts of God, Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion Jainism Jain texts claim that the universe consists of jiva (life force or souls) and ajiva (lifeless objects). According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents-soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion-have always existed. The universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator god. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/devas, but these heavenly beings are not viewed as creators-they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and are portrayed as mortal. According to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (Tirthankara). Besides scriptural authority, Jains also employ syllogism and deductive reasoning to refute creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the vedics, sƒÅmkhyas, mimimsas, Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain ƒÄcƒÅryas, such as Jinasena in MahƒÅpurƒÅna. Others Philosophical models not falling within established religious structures, such as Daoism, Confucianism, Deism, and Pandeism, have also been considered to be nontheistic religions. The Satanic Temple, a sect of modern or rational Satanism, was officially recognized as a nontheistic religion in the United States on 25 April 2019. The white supremacist Creativity movement has also been described as a nontheistic religion.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/24/neo- nazi-bought-church-with-plans-to-name-it-after-trump-a-fire-destroyed-it/  See also  * Antitheism * Creativity (religion) * Conceptions of God * Epicureanism * Ethical Culture * Falsifiability * Freethought * Humanism * Ietsism * Irreligion * Jediism * Language, Truth, and Logic * Mu (negative) * Naturalistic pantheism * Nondualism * Pantheism * Ra√´lism * Secular religion * Syntheism * Transcendentalism * Transtheistic * Unitarian Universalism  References  * ","title":"Nontheistic religion"},{"id":"28193346","text":"Mikhaƒìl II may refer to: * Michael II, Byzantine Emperor (died in 829) * Patriarch Michael II of Constantinople (ruled 1143‚Äì1146) * Michael II Komnenos Doukas (died in 1266/68) ","title":"Mikhaƒìl II"},{"id":"28193356","text":"Mikhaƒìl IV may refer to: * Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1010‚Äì1041) * Patriarch Michael IV of Constantinople (died in 1214) ","title":"Mikhaƒìl IV"},{"id":"28193358","text":"Procryptocerus is a Neotropical genus of gliding ants, with the ability to \\"parachute\\" by steering their fall if they drop off of the tree they're on. Distribution Procryptocerus inhabits rainforests from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico to northern Argentina. Due to their cryptic habits, living inside twigs, these ants are rarely collected. At present, most species are known from Central America, Colombia and Brazil. Taxonomy The genus was created by Emery (1887) to include species of Neotropical ants that were considered similar to those of the Paleotropical genus Cataulacus. Procryptocerus has been the object of two revisionary studies. Kempf (1951) revised the entire genus and Longino and Snelling (2002) the Central American species. Kempf (1951) recognized 28 species, and 8 subspecies, while for Central America Longino and Snelling (2002) recognized 14 species, described four new species, synonymized two species, and elevated two subspecies to species level. Currently, 45 species are included in the genus. Description The genus is characterized by the protrusion of the clypeus forming a broad nasus and antennal scrobes over the eyes. The toruli are located right posterior to the flanks of the nasus opposite to each other. The vertex is deflexed posteriorly in most species. Procryptocerus ants possess notoriously variable morphology. Different characters, such as propodeal spine length, form of the clypeus, type of sculpture, and other such characters vary remarkably, sometimes even within the same species. Knowledge of morphology and anatomy is incomplete for all species. Adult workers are mostly black in color, body variously sculptured and monomorphic, ranging from 3.5‚Äì8.5 mm. Although similar to workers, gyne are larger (3.7‚Äì9.5 mm) with thoracic sclerites corresponding to alates in other apocritans. Males are longer and more slender than gynes, ranging from 4.8 mm to 9.9 mm in length.

Waring and his family were the first individuals to occupy the house, taking up residence in November 1874. The Waring House is a brick structure that rests upon a foundation of stone; it is topped with a roof of asphalt, and various other elements are made of metal., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-07-29. Its overall floor plan is rectangular, although modified by the addition of three wings to the rear.

Among the Waring House's leading architectural elements are its windows, especially the distinctive segmental windows of the dining room wing. Overall, the house is a fine example of the Victorian style of residential architecture; although many nineteenth-century Greenville houses have been well preserved to the present time, few are as pristine as the home of Thomas Waring. In recognition of its historically significant architecture, the Waring House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 16, 1977; it was recognized as important primarily in the local community. Six other Greenville houses ‚Äî known as the Beir, Coppess, Garst, Lansdowne, Leftwich, and Robeson Houses ‚Äî have been accorded a similar honor; the Waring House was the fourth of these seven buildings to receive this designation.

While there, she encouraged her girls to develop into new, modern Chinese women, often against the wishes of their traditional parents. She was committed to the idea of women's independence, however, and knew that if she could give them the tools they needed through education, they could change the face of China. Personal life In 1924 she married Frederick Bohn Fisher.Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity: Welthy Honsinger Fisher The Fishers were well-acquainted with and respected by Gandhi and other prominent leaders of the Indian Independence movement. Following her husband's death in 1938, she wrote her husband's biography and traveled widely, returning to China and then to India. Literacy work During the 1940s, Welthy spent \\"semesters\\" studying the educational systems of Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, India and the Middle East. During this time she studied women and educational systems, and lectured throughout the U.S. on women of the world and Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. In December, 1947, six weeks before his death, Gandhi urged Welthy to return to his country to continue her work in education in India's villages. In 1952, at the age of 73, Welthy returned to India to work with Frank Laubach, the Christian Evangelical missionary and literacy pioneer. Deciding that literacy training linked with agricultural and industrial development was a key strategy to eradicate poverty, Welthy broke with Laubach. In 1953, she founded Literacy House at Allahabad, a small, non-formal school that combined literacy with vocational training. In 1956, Literacy House moved to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where it became famous for its effectiveness. Realizing the need for literacy programs linked with social and economic development throughout the world, Welthy and her fellow literacy pioneers started two non-profit organizations, World Education (in 1951, which started as World Literacy) and the World Literacy of Canada (in 1955). Welthy closely involved in both organizations for many years, either as President or an advisor. Throughout her nineties, she traveled throughout the world. Welthy made her final trip to India as a government guest in 1980, shortly before her death at the age of 101 in Southbury, Connecticut.

Single volumes occasionally appear at auction houses but they are extremely rare. Hollinshead Hall, a manor house in Lancashire and Thomas de Trafford, a Lancashire baronet, were subjects included in the book. Witton House is another example of a manor house that was included in the volumes . It was originally built in 1800 by a member of the Feilden family, Henry. The family had been lords of the manor of Witton for many years and due to years of land acquisition became the largest landowners in Blackburn. The house was described by Edward Twycross in his work, ' The Mansions of England and Wales,' as: ' a very elegant stone edifice in the Grecian style. It is constructed of cream coloured freestone, richly veined, and has in the centre of its eastern front a splendid portico, supported by columns of the Doric order. The principal apartments, which are of noble proportions, are enriched by several paintings by the best modern masters. the situation of the house is particularly fine; it stands on a rising ground in the midst of rich plantations, and commands some splendid views, affording every variety of scenery.

The company specializes in the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of threat intelligence. Recorded Future uses patented machine learning and natural language processing methods to continuously collect and organize data from open web, dark web, and technical sources. The resulting information is displayed within a software- as-a-service portal. History In 2007, co-founders Christopher Ahlberg and Staffan Truv√©, both Ph.D.s in computer science from Chalmers University of Technology, filed for Recorded Future‚Äôs first patent (granted in 2013 as United States patent US8468153B2) - Data Analysis System with Automated Query and Visualization Environment Setup.https://patents.google.com/patent/US8468153 The patent laid the foundation for continuous collection and processing of data and information from sources across the open, deep, and dark web, facilitated by machine learning. Recorded Future was officially incorporated in 2009. The company received initial funding from Google and In-Q-Tel, as reported in a July 2010 introduction to Recorded Future published by Wired. Recognizing that its algorithms and visualization software matched needs within the intelligence community, Recorded Future entered the cyber threat intelligence market in January 2012. In 2014, the company launched Recorded Future Dark Web, integrating open and dark web sourcing as well as dark web forum access and analysis. In 2016, Recorded Future was named a partner for threat intelligence by Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, and Vencore GEOINT. In May 2017, Recorded Future introduced Insikt Group,https://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/recorded-future-launches-threat-research-arm-to-enhance-threat- intelligence-offering-300454937.html the company‚Äôs threat intelligence research arm. The word ‚Äúinsikt‚Äù is Swedish, a nod to Recorded Future's co- founders, and means ‚Äúinsight.‚Äù Insikt Group is responsible for delivering analyst-generated assessments, insights, and recommended actions to customers and the public. In May 2019, New York-based private equity firm Insight Partners acquired Recorded Future for $780 million. In November 2019, the company opened a second office in Somerville with the goal of building a ‚Äúcampus‚Äù in the Davis Square area. Recorded Future currently employs more than 430 people around the world. Services Using what they call a \\"Temporal Analytics Engine,\\" Recorded Future provides forecasting and analysis tools to help analysts predict future events by scanning sources on the internet, and extracting, measuring, and visualizing the information to show networks and patterns in the past, present, and future. , the engine was described as \\"Web Intelligence Engine.\\" Likewise, the Washington Post, in an article authored by Stewart Baker - the former General Counsel of the National Security Agency (1992‚Äì1994), which had described the company as a predictive analytics web intelligence firm deleted the term upon request of RF. The software analyzes sources and forms \\"invisible links\\" between documents to find links that tie them together and may possibly indicate the entities and events involved. Noah Schachtmann from WIRED ‚Äì who first wrote about Google and the CIA both investing in RF ‚Äì described the company in an interview as follows: \\"Recorded Future is a company that strips out from web pages the sort of who, what, when, where, why ‚Äî sort of who‚Äôs involved, [...] where are they going, what kind of events are they going to.\\" Clients initially included the financial sector with quantitative investors, but since 2013 they have changed to businesses seeking cyber security, per Ahlberg, for example SITA (IT company), a global air transport IT company. Organization The company was founded in 2009 by Christopher Ahlberg and had 20 employees as of November 2011. Google Ventures and In-Q-Tel invested \\"under $10 million each\\" into the Recorded Future shortly after the company was founded. Google published this on May 3, 2010 In-Q-Tel is an investment arm of the CIA. , it had partnerships with IBM, HP ArcSight, Cimation, Ethnographic Edge, Tiberium Security, and Malformity Labs LLC per its company profile published by Businessweek. Analysis  = China Vulnerability Database Report= In November 2017, Recorded Future published analysis asserting that the Ministry of State Security (China) influences or alters their National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD) to coverup espionage activities. The analysis concludes \\"vulnerabilities commonly exploited by malware linked to Chinese APT groups\\" are inconsistent with CNNVD publication practices. The company presented further analysis in March 2018 at the Kaspersky Labs Analyst Summit, presenting evidence that the Chinese government retroactively changed the original publication dates. = Al-Qaeda Report= In May 2014, Recorded Future released a report called \\"How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 1).\\" Part 2 of the report was released on August 1, 2014, supposedly with a strengthened \\"earlier hypothesis about Snowden leaks influencing Al-Qaeda‚Äôs crypto product innovation.\\" On the same day National Public Radio aired Recorded Future claims of \\"tangible evidence\\" that Edward Snowden harmed national security by prompting terrorists to develop more sophisticated encryption programs. Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman criticized Recorded Future's report did not prove causation between Snowden's leak and improved encryption by al-Qaeda. = Occupy Wall Street Media Monitoring Report= In 2011, Recorded Future reported, \\"... gaining online momentum for the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Based at the Athletic Ground, Treherbert were one of the first professional Welsh teams, formed in 1908 but folding after just two seasons. Treherbert also produced a single player, David Galloway, who gained international caps directly from the team. Formation In 1908 Treherbert was a large village at the head of the Rhondda Valley, a heavy industrial coal mining area. The village already had a rugby union team, Treherbert RFC, but after the creation of two rugby league clubs in 1907, Merthyr Tydfil and Ebbw Vale, attempts were made to form a professional team to play in the Northern Rugby League. In April 1908, the Treherbert and District Northern Union Club Ltd was formed with capital of ¬£500.Lush (1998), pg. 32 The team played at the Athletic Ground in the village, and set their headquarters at the local pub, the Dunraven Hotel. Treherbert were admitted to the Northern Union on 30 June 1908, along with fellow Rhondda team Mid-Rhondda. Treherbert not only joined the Northern Union, but with the addition of Barry and Aberdare, the six newly formed teams set up the Welsh League. Club history =1908-1909= Treherbert's first game of the 1908/09 season was on 5 September 1908 against fellow Welsh club Barry, Treherbert lost 3-6.Lush (1998), pg. 259 A week later the club faced their first team from the Northern Leagues, a home tie with Halifax which Treherbert being outscored seven tries to two, losing 6-27. The very next game was against Mid-Rhondda, and resulted in Treherbert's first win. Although failing to beat the north of England teams, they continued to do well against their fellow Welsh teams. On 17 December 1908, Treherbert faced the touring Australian national team. In front of a crowd of 4000,Kangaroo Tour: 1908-1909 Sean Fagan, rl1908.com the Welsh club lost to Australia by a narrow 3-6 score, the 'Kangaroos' outscoring Treherbert by two tries to one.Lush (1998), pg. 33 Treherbert's results continued to be poor in the second half of the season, including a heavy 29-0 defeat away to Dewsbury. More difficulties occurred when, in a 10-0 defeat by Merthyr Tydfil RLFC, two newly acquired players, Bob Williams and H. Harding, were prevented from playing after their joining forms had been 'destroyed'. After a further loss to Ebbw Vale and a draw with Barry, Treherbert faced Merthyr Tydfil again, this time a Welsh League match. Treherbert's win over Merthyr Tydfil was described as 'one of the greatest surprises of the football season', but bad followed good, when in the last game of the season, in a Welsh League encounter with Mid-Rhondda, the referee left the pitch before the end of the game in protest of both teams' rough play. Treherbert finished their first season with four wins, a draw and 13 losses, finishing 28th out of 31 clubs. =1909-1910= Treherbert's second season was also their last, Barry, Aberdare and Mid-Rhondda had all already folded after just a single season, leaving only three clubs to contest the Welsh League. The season was a poor experience on and off the pitch, starting with a 10-22 loss to Hull Kingston Rovers, in which Alfred Francis scored one of Treherbert's two tries, which was followed by a further straight losses. To complicate matters further, the attendance figures at home matches were poor, last minute team changes were frequent and their club secretary, H.R. Jones, resigned during the season. The only good news the club received was when one of their forwards, David Galloway was selected for the Wales national team, in a late 1909 away encounter with England. Galloway did enough to impress as four months later he was reselected for the national team again, again against England, but this time played on home soil at Ebbw Vale's Bridge End Field.Gate (1986), pg. 141 On 12 February 1910, Treherbert played their last home game, a 5-7 loss to Merthyr. The next Monday, the team failed to appear for the Welsh League clash with Ebbw Vale. They then failed to honour an away fixture with Hull Kingston Rovers, who instead arranged a match with a newly formed Coventry team instead. Almost two months after their last home game, Treherbert managed to put together a team to face Oldham, a terrible 13-54 loss. After the game the press described Treherbert as 'pathetic'. This was the end of Treherbert. At the Northern Rugby League's 1910 AGM in Huddersfield, the Northern Union secretary stated that Treherbert were defaulters and that although they had been given help by other clubs they had failed to fulfill their fixture list, and were therefore not eligible to return to the Union the following season. Treherbert were replaced the next season by Coventry and never played a league game again. In that final season they had completed only 12 games, for an aggregate score of 55-289. The ground is now covered by light industry on the banks of the River Rhondda.

Horton and Amanda Bradish Farmstead is a privately owned farmhouse that sits on 40 acres (16 ha) of land at 4650 West Horton Road in rural Fairfield Township in Lenawee County, Michigan. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 1, 2007. There are several other buildings on the property, but the main farmhouse was built in 1888 in Queen Anne Style. History George B. Horton was born on April 17, 1845, in Lafayette, Ohio, the son of Samuel and Lucina Horton. The Horton family moved to Michigan in 1851, and established a farm located across the road from this present farmstead. Lucina Horton had knowledge of cheese-making, and the family began processing cheese in 1853, and by 1866 founded a cheese factory. George Horton worked on the farm, and when his father died in 1872, bought out his sisters and began farming the then 350-acre tract, which includes some of the acreage associated with the present homestead. Horton married Amanda Bradish in 1878, and continued to expand his holdings, acquiring 710 acres by the early 1890s. In about 1888, the couple constructed the large brick home on this farmstead, located across the road from his parents‚Äô home. By the early 1900s, Horton owned over 1,400 acres of farmland and forest, spread over four farmsteads in the county, and in 1914 he owned seven cheese factories capable of producing 1.5 million pounds of cheese per year. George Horton died in 1922, and his children carried on his estate. His son Norman B. Horton moved into the house along with his mother Amanda. However, the holdings declined to only 80 acres in 1933, and Norman Horton committed suicide. The farm was sold multiple times afterward. Fred and Carolyn Holden purchased it in 1982, and sold it to Ed and Joann Allen in 2004. Description The George B. and Amanda Bradish Horton Farmstead consists of a c. 1888 Queen Anne residence along with a barn and shed, both constructed around 1900. The farmstead is set back from the road, and the immediate area of the farmstead encompassed about four acres. The house is a large two-and-a-half story brick structure with a central hipped roof and four cross gables. A turret is located at one corner of the house. Most of windows are one-over-one double-hung sash with concrete sills and brick hoods. The front contains a single-story hip-roof porch, wrapping around to one side. The porch is supported with square columns A second porch is located on the other side of the house. The front also has a gable with bay window and upper balconies. On the interior, the house has a central entry hall, with two parlors at the front and a stair leading upward. In the rear are a library and bath on one side, and a dining room and kitchen on the other. A casual sitting room completes the layout. On the second floor, there are four large bedrooms and two smaller bedrooms, originally designed for servants, as well as a bathroom and laundry room.

Species do not produce spores, but are composed of hyphae and sclerotia (hyphal propagules) and are asexual states of fungi in the genus Thanatephorus. Rhizoctonia species are saprotrophic, but are also facultative plant pathogens, causing commercially important crop diseases. They are also endomycorrhizal associates of orchids. The genus name was formerly used to accommodate many superficially similar, but unrelated fungi. Taxonomy =History= Rhizoctonia was introduced in 1815 by French mycologist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle for plant pathogenic fungi that produce both hyphae and sclerotia. \\"Rhizoctonia\\" means \\"root killer\\" and de Candolle's original species, Rhizoctonia crocorum (teleomorph Helicobasidium purpureum), is the causal agent of violet root rot of carrots and other root vegetables. Subsequent authors added over 100 additional names to the genus, most of them plant pathogens bearing only a superficial resemblance to the type species. Rhizoctonia thus became an artificial form genus comprising a diverse range of unrelated species. As part of a move towards a more natural classification of fungi, R.T. Moore proposed in 1987 that Rhizoctonia should be restricted to the type species and its relatives, with unrelated species moved to other genera. Unfortunately, this meant that the best-known but unrelated species, Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph Thanatephorus cucumeris), would have undergone a name change to Moniliopsis solani. To avoid this, it was subsequently proposed that R. solani should replace R. crocorum as the type species of Rhizoctonia. This proposal was passed and the type of Rhizoctonia is now conserved as R. solani under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. =Current status= In its current sense, the genus is effectively restricted to the type species R. solani and its synonyms. The genus name is still, however, widely used in its old, artificial sense. Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, places Rhizoctonia within the family Ceratobasidiaceae. =Redisposition of former species= A comprehensive survey and redisposition of species names in Rhizoctonia was published in 1994 by Andersen & Stalpers. Only a few frequently used names are listed below. Many older names are of uncertain application or were never validly published, or both. *Rhizoctonia bataticola = Macrophomina phaseolina (Botryosphaeriaceae) *Rhizoctonia carotae = Fibulorhizoctonia carotae (teleomorph Athelia arachnoidea)(Atheliaceae) *Rhizoctonia cerealis = not a validly published name (teleomorph Ceratobasidium cereale) (Ceratobasidiaceae) *Rhizoctonia crocorum = Thanatophytum crocorum (teleomorph Helicobasidium purpureum) (Helicobasidiaceae) *Rhizoctonia fragariae = not a validly published name (teleomorph Ceratobasidium cornigerum) (Ceratobasidiaceae) *Rhizoctonia goodyerae-repentis = a name of uncertain application, but generally interpreted as Ceratobasidium cornigerum (Ceratobasidiaceae) *Rhizoctonia leguminicola = Botrytis fabae (Sclerotiniaceae) *Rhizoctonia oryzae = not a validly published name and of uncertain application, but generally interpreted as Waitea circinata (Corticiaceae) *Rhizoctonia ramicola = Ceratorhiza ramicola (teleomorph Ceratobasidium ramicola) (Ceratobasidiaceae) *Rhizoctonia rubi = not a validly published name and of uncertain application (probably Ascomycota) *Rhizoctonia zeae = Waitea circinata (Corticiaceae) Habitat and distribution Species are saprotrophic, occurring in the soil and producing basidiocarps (fruit bodies of the Thanatephorus teleomorph) on dead stems and plant detritus. They are also opportunistic plant pathogens, with an almost unlimited host range, and have been isolated from orchid mycorrhiza. Distribution appears to be cosmopolitan.  Economic importance  Rhizoctonia solani causes a wide range of commercially significant plant diseases. It is one of the fungi responsible for Brown patch (a turfgrass disease), damping off in seedlings, as well as black scurf of potatoes, bare patch of cereals, root rot of sugar beet, belly rot of cucumber, sheath blight of rice, and many other pathogenic conditions. An efficient conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and/or tryptophol can be achieved by some species in the genus Rhizoctonia.Efficient Conversion of L-Tryptophan to Indole-3-Acetic Acid and/or Tryptophol by Some Species of Rhizoctonia.

Opening and early years In 1979, self-taught chef Nora Pouillon opened Restaurant Nora on the corner of Florida Avenue and 21st in the DuPont Circle neighborhood. Journalist Sally Quinn and her late husband, Washington Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee were early patrons and financial backers of the restaurant. Quinn offered a piece of advice: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention anything about being healthy and natural. That sounds so unappetizing. That sounds like hippie food.‚Äù Pouillon ignored it, making her organic ingredients the focus of the restaurant. The early reviews for Nora's were mixed, with Robert Shoffner of the Washingtonian less than enthusiastic about Pouillon's food. In 1980, The Washington Post's Phyllis Richman noted that \\"the cooking has matured,\\" calling Nora's \\"a sophisticated return to old-fashioned home cooking, with dishes from here and there but ingredients only from impeccable sources that raise their meats without chemicals.\\" By the early 1990s, Nora's became a destination for D.C‚Äôs media and political elite, particularly in the administration of President Bill Clinton. In 1996, Chef Nora was named U.S.A. Chef of the Year by the American Tasting Institute, and she published a cookbook, Cooking with Nora : seasonal menus from Restaurant Nora : healthy, light, balanced, and simple food with organic ingredients. Organic certification In the mid-90s, Chef Nora began to investigate how Restaurant Nora could become an organic certified restaurant and learned that no certification process existed. She decided to set about creating those standards. She worked for two years with Oregon Tilth, a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to supporting and advocating organic food and farming. The Oregon Tilth Certified Organic Program was established in 1982 and is an Accredited Certifying Agent for the USDA‚Äôs National Organic Program. The resulting standard required that 95 percent of the food used, as a certified restaurant, must be obtained from USDA certified organic sources. ‚ÄúThis meant obtaining proof of organic certification from all our suppliers,‚Äù she says. Chef Nora complied with the lengthy requirements, and in 1999 Nora's became the first certified organic restaurant in the country. For many restaurants across the country, achieving and maintaining proof that 95 percent of suppliers are organic is a costly and time-consuming process. As Chef Nora explained to Organic Connections Magazine about becoming certified: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt always understand how complicated and time consuming it is,‚Äù Pouillon explains. ‚ÄúAlmost everything has to be organic down to the spices and coffee. It‚Äôs a lot of work to find certified organic farmers and track down certification papers from 35-plus purveyors every year. This process has to be done each year because the certificates have to be renewed each year.‚Äù Later years and closure By the early 2000s, the restaurant was a fixture in Washington's dining scene, being named among Washingtonian magazine's \\"Very Best Restaurants.\\" In 2016, Nora's was one of the approximately 100 restaurants reviewed in the first Michelin Guide for Washington, D.C. Restaurant Nora closed in June 2017, upon Chef Nora's retirement. She was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the James Beard Foundation, celebrating her career at the restaurant. In October 2018, D.C. restaurateur Ashok Bajaj bought the Restaurant Nora property for just more than $4 million. Notable patrons and events Restaurant Nora has held lunches, dinners and events for dignitaries, congressional members and White House administrations, and was a favorite of Hillary Clinton. In 1993, President Bill Clinton held his first inaugural party at the restaurant. Many of Clinton's cabinet members and staff ate at Nora's in the 90s, and Vice President Al Gore and Tipper Gore celebrated her 45th birthday at the restaurant. President Jimmy Carter also ate at Nora‚Äôs, and so did Nancy Reagan. Asked about her Presidential patrons in The Washington Post, Pouillon said: ‚ÄúNeither of the Bush presidents ever set foot in Nora‚Äôs, but Laura Bush came, along with her two daughters,‚Äù Pouillon announces proudly. ‚ÄúGood food, it seems, is also bipartisan.‚Äù In January 2010, President Barack Obama held a surprise birthday party for First Lady Michelle Obama at the restaurant.

Early life and education Duke William V of Cleves, by Heinrich Aldegrever All four of John III‚Äôs children spent their early years together under the care of their mother, Maria, before William went away to be educated for his future life as duke of Cleves. On the other hand, Amalia and her two sisters, Sibylle and Anne, had an old-fashioned and limited education from a 16th-century viewpoint, in which household arts such as needlework and housekeeping were emphasized to equip the daughters for their roles as wives and consorts to princes, while music and playing instruments, for instance, were not taught. Furthermore, the small German court did not follow the Italian fashion which was common in other noble families at the time. Marriage negotiations Henry VIII by Holbein King Henry VIII of England was considering a marital alliance with Cleves, so following negotiations with the duchy, Hans Holbein the Younger, Henry's court painter, was dispatched to paint Amalia and Anne for the freshly widowed king in August 1539. After seeing the paintings, Henry chose Anne. It is probable that he chose the elder sister because of her more favorable hereditary rights in her father's duchy. In the following years, Amalia's family attempted to secure her a marriage with as much profit as possible. There were long negotiations with the Margraviate of Baden concerning a possible strategic marriage between the two dynasties. The margrave had two sons; first, Bernard, who had been turned out due to his immoral and raucous behavior, before being welcomed back after his sisters pleaded with the margrave; and second, Charles, who was born in July 1529 and thus, almost twelve years younger than Amalia. William, respecting his sister, refused to marry Amalia off to someone like Bernard, whom he believed could not have children with Amalia due to his dissolute life. The duke also refused to force Amalia to marry Charles, who was but a child. As a result, Amalia remained unmarried. Later life William went on to have four daughters and two sons with his wife, Maria of Austria. Amalia helped raise her nieces, who received a Lutheran education, whereas the two sons received a Catholic education. Amalia herself observed the Lutheran faith and was unwilling to allow her nieces to adhere to Catholicism. Amalia's dedication to Lutheranism so enraged her brother that allegedly, at one point, he drew his sword and went after Amalia, before being stopped by a servant. Amalia also seems to have had a fondness for music and poetry. There is a songbook, the original of which can be found in Berlin, in which Amalia was very interested. The book, which was owned by a friend of Amalia's, contains five religious songs, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and twenty-seven love songs. Amalia hand- wrote a poem into the book, about longing for a beloved. Amalia also authored a song book which is currently found in the German national library in Berlin, with copies in the public library of Frankfurt and the university library of Frankfurt. Anne of Cleves, who remained in England after her marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, bequeathed a diamond ring to Amalia. Amalia died on the first of March 1586 in D√ºsseldorf, aged 68 years old, having outlived both her sisters.

The name Vinylmation is a combination of the word Animation and Vinyl. Most figures are all shaped with the body of Mickey Mouse but have different themed markings, colors, and patterns. This means that all figures have round mouse ears, whether or not the painted character has them. This is accommodated by painting the ears with backgrounds - stars, stripes, rainbows - to match the painted character. The series exception is the Park Starz series which does not resemble Mickey at all, and more closely resembles iconic figures from the parks. Vinylmation was first introduced in July 2008, and the first figures were introduced in November 2008.Official Disney Vinylmation FAQ. Retrieved July 29, 2010.

However, despite Disney's ban on trading, trading still happens between private collections. Over the past few years, online trading has become more prevalent, with sites appearing dedicated to trading and trading news. A web app is now available where Vinylmation collectors can go to organize their collections, get detailed information about every Vinylmation made to date, trade their Vinylmation, and buy Vinylmation. Vinylmation figurines are tradeable through friends, clubs, or other owners of Vinylmation figurines. At some locations, old or dulled figurines can be traded for new figurines.

Unlike the other series, buyers are aware of the color of vinyl they will buy prior to purchase by way of a window on the packaging. The purpose of blank Vinylmations is, similar to toys like the Munny by Kidrobot, to provide a three-dimensional canvas on which fans can play artist and draw, paint, or otherwise apply their own art or designs to the figure, creating their own one-of-a-kind piece of Disney art. To assist fans in customization, Disney has recently introduced decals, rhinestones, and colored pencils embellished with Vinylmation motifs to use in the creation of their figures.

The film is about the struggle for survival of four women who are Kudumbasree workers. Girija (Revathi) is a widow with 2 school going girls. Suhara (Shwetha Menon) has her husband (Saddiq) bed-ridden after an accident and his operation requires a huge amount. Santha aka Santhedatthi (K. P. A. C.

The four makes a living working as city cleaners with Kudumbasree in Kozhikode Corporation. Girija and Santhedatthi take money from the money lender Unnithan Muthalali (Nedumudi Venu). One day the four find 30 lakhs rupees ( 3,000,000) left in a waste bin. Initially they went to handover the money to police but later decided against it, due to their necessity for money, and handed over the money to Unnithan muthalali who agrees to pay them a good interest every month. Meanwhile, police finds a corpse in the city and found out that the person who got murdered was a hawala (black money) agent. Police, led by Circle Inspector Antony (Lal), started investigating about the missing money and the clues led to the four women. Meanwhile, Raji got engaged to Mani. The four were interrogated by the police. Initially they denied any involvement and were remanded and sent to sub-jail. There Raji was attacked by three women with immoral intentions. Suhara fought them all and saved Raji. They were released on bail with the help of Adv. Maheswari Iyer (Praveena). Later Girija asked the money back from Unnithan, but Unnithan initially denied to return the money and demanded Girija to share his bed for the money. Girija informed this to the others and they together fought Unnithan and tricked him to retrieve the money. Finally they got the news that some charity will sponsor the operation of Suhara's husband. They handed over the money to the widow of the hawala agent who was murdered for the money.

He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). Career Born 13 January 1911 in Gainfarn, in the Baden-bei-Wien region of Austria, Schmid joined the Austrian Air Force in 1933. After the Anschluss in 1938 he was drafted into the Luftwaffe as an Oberfeldwebel and flew with the \\"Condor Legion\\" in the latter stages of the Spanish Civil War.Luftwaffe Officer Career Summaries website. Upon his return he was awarded the Spanish Cross with Swords and transferred to the 1st Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 2 (1./JG 2) stationed on the French border. His first victory came at the outset of the French Campaign, on 14 May 1940, by shooting down a Morane 406 fighter. He ended the campaign with 7 victories and in June was commissioned as a Leutnant.Aces of the Luftwaffe website. At the height of the Battle of Britain, in August 1940, with 9 victories, he was transferred to instructor duties. Upon his return a year later at the start of August 1941 Johann, now an Oberleutnant, was assigned to the Geschwaderstab (HQ Flight) of JG 26. Under the redoubtable Adolf Galland, the unit was based on the Channel coast to cover the western front from the RAF. As if to make up for lost time, he then quickly shot down 12 aircraft in 2 weeks, including 3 Spitfires on 7 August (13-15v.), 3 more on the 9th (16-18v.) and 3 more again the day after (19-21v.).Weal 1999, pg. 24. Dilip Sarkar suggested that perhaps Schmid's most eminent victim may have been RAF flying ace Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock, (No. 611 Squadron RAF, plane Spitfire Mk V, W3257) who was reported by his own side as shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 3 August 1941 near Boulogne, but whose crash site was not ascertained. Sarkar, who cross referenced Lock's disappearance with Luftwaffe combat claims for the same day discovered that while Lock's Spitfire was the only RAF plane lost that day, Schmid reported having shot down a Spitfire into the sea (English Channel) near Calais, the only verified Luftwaffe victory for that day. In reality, Lock was lost in the morning of the 3 August.Royal Air Force Fighter Command Losses of the Second World War: Operational Losses - Aircraft and Crews, 1939-1941, Volume 1 Schmid claimed his victory in the evening at 18:32.Caldwell, Donald The JG 26 War Diary@ Volume One 1939-1942, p. 161. Decorated with the Ritterkreuz on 21 August 1941 after achieving 24 victories and promoted to Hauptmann, the next day he was given command of 8./JG 26. His scoring spree continued, as he scored 11 victories in September and a Spitfire on 3 October 1941. On 6 November 1941, as the Battle of Britain was petering out, he led the whole III Gruppe into combat against a dozen Spitfires. Shooting one down over the Channel (Sgt B.M. Geissman of 452 Sqn RAAF), he was circling low over the crash site when the wing of his Bf 109 (Black-1 W.Nr 7211) hit the water. The aircraft immediately disintegrated and sank, taking Schmid with it.Weal 1999, p.24 Johann Schmid was credited with 45 victories in 137 missions, all over the Western Front and including 34 Spitfires.

The Security Council reaffirmed the need to combat threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts and the obligation of states to adhere to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. It deplored claims of responsibility by Al-Qaeda for the attacks in Kenya, affirmed the obligations of states under Resolution 1390 (2002), and expressed sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and the people and governments of Kenya and Israel. The resolution called upon all states to bring the perpetrators to justice in accordance with their obligations under Resolution 1373. Finally, the Council concluded by expressing its determination to combat all forms of terrorism. Resolution 1450 was adopted by 14 out of the 15 Council members, while Syria was opposed to it. Explaining their vote, the Syrian representative said the country condemned the terrorist attacks but opposed the repeated use of Israel in the text and language that deviated from the main purpose of the resolution. Furthermore, Syria stated that Israel had committed \\"terrorist atrocities\\" itself daily against the Palestinian people. The adoption of the resolution also marked the first time that Israeli losses were mentioned or condemned in a resolution; the Security Council did not mention Israeli losses in the aftermath of the 1994 AMIA bombing in Argentina.

Frans Cawen and Eleanora Cawen (n√©e Boije af Gennas), both of whom were interested in music and art. Several well-known artists were friends of his parents. As a young man Cawen studied at the Academy of Fine Arts (Finland) between 1905 and 1907, and in Paris between 1908 and 1909 at the studio of Simon Cottet. He had his first exhibition in Finland in 1910, but in 1912 he returned to Paris, from where he traveled to Brittany and Spain. November Group, 1921 In late 1916 Cawen became a founder member of the November Group, which was a Finnish group of expressionists and cubists. After the first World War he travelled in 1919 to Denmark, Italy, Spain and France; and in that year became a teacher at the Drawing School of the Finnish Art Society, where he continued to teach until 1921. Self-Portrait, 1923 In 1924 he travelled again in Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1929 he became a member of the Fine Art Academy of Finland; and from then until 1935 he was chairman of the Artists' Association of Finland. In Finland Cawen lived near Porvoo at Ilola (his mother's childhood home). Among his works are altarpieces for churches in M√§ntt√§, Kuusankoski, Lapinlahti, and Simpele.

When police contacted the Cottrez family to question them about the discoveries, Dominique immediately admitted that the bodies belonged to two infants she had given birth to. She also told police that six more infants' bodies were hidden in the garage. All were born over an approximately 17-year period between 1989 and 2006 or 2007.

They are the creators of the Hot Hand Motion Controlled Wah Filter as well as Soundblox and Soundblox Pro effect pedals. They design their products in the United States, and import them from China. History Source Audio was founded in 2005 by Roger Smith (president) and Jesse Remignanti (vice president of engineering), while they worked together at the semiconductor firm, Analog Devices. Chief Scientist Bob Chidlaw, owner of two digital signal processing patents at Kurzweil Music Systems, and Chief Operating Officer C. Hunter Boll, former managing director at Thomas H. Lee Partners, joined shortly thereafter. Source Audio's initial innovation was the Hot Hand Motion Controlled Wah Filter. The Hot Hand Motion Controller Ring converts hand movement into a digital signal using an accelerometer, a technology pioneered by Analog Devices. The ring combined with the Motion Controlled Wah Filter pedal produces effects similar to the Dunlop Cry Baby Wah, a pedal made famous by players like Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. The unit offers 11 different wah filters, including classic wah, low pass, band pass, multi peak‚Äîand volume swell, which produce a wide range of wah effects.http://emusician.com/signalprocessors/source_audio/ SA followed the Motion Controlled Wah Filter with the Motion Controlled Phaser/Flanger pedal. Like the Wah, the Phaser/Flanger is compatible with the Hot Hand Wireless Adapter and offers multiple tone options. The Source Audio Phaser/Flanger offers both LFO and Envelope Follower filters. In 2008 Source Audio released the Soundblox Series, four Hot Hand compatible pedals. The Sounblox Tri-Mod Wah, Phaser, and Flanger offer effects similar to the original pedals, but package them in a smaller, easier to use format. The Soundblox Series also includes the Soundblox Multiwave Distortion, a pedal that incorporates both multi band and single band processing and produces several unique distortion tones. In total the pedal offers 21 different distortion types ranging from standard distortion to synth-like octave and foldback distortions. At the 2010 NAMM show SA introduced the Soundblox Pro Series.http://www.premierguitar.com/Video/20090120/498/Source_Audio_Soundblox_Pro_Multiwave_Distortion.aspx The Soundblox Pro Series offers the same effect types as the corresponding Soundblox pedals, but also include 6 user presets, a 7-band graphic EQ, a MIDI input and the capability to ‚Äúmorph‚Äù from one user preset to another with an expression pedal.http://www.sourceaudio.net/products/soundblox_pro/index.php 2010 also marked Source Audio‚Äôs entry into the bass effects pedal market with the Soundblox and Soundblox Pro Multiwave Bass Distortion pedals. The Bass Multiwave incorporates the same signal processing method as the Soundblox Pro Multiwave Distortion for the guitar but adapts it to fit the lower frequency range of the bass guitar.

It was established in 1993. The program accepts, accommodates, and prepares young people with a wide range of disabilities including Visual Impairment, Hearing Impairment, Learning disability, Mental disorder, Developmental disability, and Physical Disability for college. The Scholars program was originally funded by the National Science Foundation and accepted students nationally. Now the Scholars program accepts Washington state high school students and is primarily funded by the state of Washington and gifts from corporations, though it is still funded partially by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Education. It inspired the University of Tokyo in Japan to start its own version of the program beginning in 2007 and the University of Malaya in Malaysia to begin a DO-IT Scholars program in 2012. Several groups in South Korea also implemented aspects of the DO-IT Scholars program. Program components The DO-IT Scholars program prepares young people with disabilities for college, careers, independent living, and leadership roles in society. DO-IT Scholars * explore careers and the world of work * learn to select and use adaptive technology, applications software, and Internet resources * experience college life on a university campus in the summer * learn about reasonable accommodations at school and in the workplace * network with peers and working professionals with disabilities * gain requisite knowledge to enter and succeed in college and challenging careers * participate in leadership opportunities that promote accessible environments, worksites, and community activities. Phases of the DO-IT Scholars Program =Phase I Scholars= These Scholars participate in the following activities: * Internetworking - use computers to enrich their education and explore academic and career interests using the Internet. They communicate electronically with mentors and other DO-IT participants from home using computers and, if necessary, special adaptive technology. DO-IT Scholars who do not have the necessary technology are loaned equipment and software while they participate in program activities. * Mentor and peer support - frequent electronic communications and personal contacts bring Scholars together with DO-IT Mentors to facilitate academic, career, and personal achievements. Mentors are college students, faculty, and practicing professionals in technical fields, many with disabilities themselves. * Summer Study I - attend a live-in summer program at the University of Washington in Seattle, DO-IT Scholars participate in academic lectures and labs; live in residence halls; and practice skills that will help them become independent and successful in college. =Phase II Scholars= These Scholars participate in the following activities: * Projects - Scholars apply their interests, skills, and knowledge to design and complete independent and team projects. DO-IT Mentors and staff act as resources. * Internetworking and Mentoring - develop and practice communication and leadership skills by acting as peer mentors for incoming Phase I DO-IT Scholars. Communication occurs in-person during the Summer Study program and electronically throughout the year * Summer Study II - Scholars return to the University of Washington campus for a one-week, live-in summer program to create and complete projects of personal interest with other DO-IT Scholars, faculty, and professionals. =Phase III Scholars= These Scholars are completing high school and transitioning to college. Throughout the year, they communicate with other Scholars, Ambassadors, and Mentors and participate in DO-IT activities. Some become Interns at DO-IT Summer Study and participate in other work experiences. =Ambassadors= A Scholar who graduates from high school becomes a DO-IT Ambassador. An Ambassador helps with program activities, participates in electronic communications, and mentors younger Scholars. Transition from High School to College Disabled students face challenges and frustrations between high school and college. Parents, IEP, and other support systems are no longer involved in advocacy. Disability support during K-12 school is required by law in order to provide all children with free education in the United States that they are entitled to and required to attend. On the other hand, no one is actually \\"entitled\\" to post-secondary education and students must apply for higher education and all students must be able to do what is needed to learn regardless of accommodations. Legislation regarding disability services are far different and less strict for higher education than primary and secondary education. It takes effort to get into the DO-IT Scholars program but it is impossible to leave it! DO-IT is an investment to make the world more accessible and friendly to all. In particular, DO-IT engages young people with disabilities who have *Leadership qualities *Challenges and willing to overcome them *Desire and ability to attend higher education About the DO-IT Center Run by the University of Washington, the DO-IT Center provides programs, publications and materials to educational institutions to help them fully integrate all students, including those with disabilities, into Academic life. DO-IT programs include the Center for Universal Design in EducationCenter for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) and a database of information on the universal design of educational facilities for students of all levels of physical, psychical and mental ability.Universal Design: Process, Principles, and Applications These design programs reduce systemic barriers which could otherwise hinder the performance of some students. The Center's universal design philosophies may be applied to professional organizations and conferences,Applications of Universal Design to Projects, Conference Exhibits, Presentations, and Professional Organizations as well as to Universal Design for Instruction. The DO-IT center seeks to assist individuals with disabilities into rewarding careers in fields including science, engineering, business, technology, as well as academic programs and careers. It promotes the use of computer and networking technologies to increase independence, productivity, and participation in education and employment.AccessComputing at DO-IT Center DO-IT has received national and regional awards including the National Information Infrastructure Award in Education; the King County Adult Service Agency Award, an Outstanding Program Award from the Washington Association on Post Secondary Education Disability (WAPED); the HealthyWay Best of the Web Award; and the President's Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring of underrepresented groups.

The park lies within Bridgeport's South End neighborhood. History Seaside Park, before 1886 P. T. Barnum Monument, sculpted by Thomas Ball in 1887, and placed at Seaside Park in 1893. As Bridgeport rapidly grew in population in the 19th century, residents recognized the need for more public parks. In 1863, The Standard urged the creation of one or more public parks in the city and a movement to create a park along Long Island Sound and Black Rock Harbor began. By 1864, P. T. Barnum and other residents had donated approximately to create Seaside Park, gradually increased to about by 1884. In 1867, plans for a seawall and a driving track and walkway were made and drawings for the park were obtained from Frederick Law Olmsted whose firm completed the work. Barnum donated additional land between Iranistan Avenue, Barnum Dyke, and Waldemere Avenue in 1878. In 1866, work on a Soldiers' monument was begun and the completed monument was dedicated in 1876. In 1884, a statue of Elias Howe was added and a bronze statue of Barnum (created by Thomas Ball) was added in 1893. A final major monument, the William Hunt Perry Memorial Arch (designed by Henry Bacon, architect of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.) was added in 1918. In 1884, Olmsted described Seaside Park as \\"a capital place for a drive or walk.... a fine dressy promenade.\\" In the early 1900s the park's driving track was still being used for horse driving, but enthusiasts of early automobiles also raced their \\"steam carriages\\" and \\"gasoline cars\\" on the park's track. The addition of Fayerweather Island in 1911 and Barnum Field in 1936, coupled with landfill operations, increased the size of the park to its present total of . Seaside Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Frederick Law Olmsted, Calvert Vaux, and Egbert Viele were the principal architects of the design. Bridgeport architect Ernest G. Southey drew plans the Casino ('old' bath house). The site contains three major historic buildings, the Casino (1918), stables erected at the same time and, on Fayerweather Island, Black Rock Harbor Light erected in 1823. and From 1994 to 2002, Bridgeport's Parks Department spent some $9 million on improvements. Results include a realignment of roads, more parking and a new bathhouse on the west beach with bathrooms, showers and cabanas. Not everyone was pleased about the physical changes. Charles W. Brilvitch, the city's official Historian said of the changes: \\"They've just disrespected the original design of the park. It was designed to have a boulevard along the waterfront, and now we've got parking lots, and we've got all this junk, this modern sculpture -- stuff that just doesn't belong in an Olmsted, Vaux and Viele park.\\" Joe P. Gresko, the city's spokesperson, said \\"When Olmsted designed the park, it was back in the 1800s, when vehicles were really rare to be seen. If we kept it as is, you're asking everyone to walk to the park. I think we've improved the park. Keeping the old bathhouse and renovating it is an example of how we're trying to keep the original design in mind.\\" Music in the park Seaside Park has a long history of being a venue for concerts. When the idea of Sunday concerts \\"for the benefit of the working people\\" was proposed in 1890, many neighboring residents opposed the plan, but Barnum, whose own home abutted the park, championed the cause in the local papers. When there was talk of police interference at the first concert, Barnum told the band leader to come play at his home and that the grounds would be open to all who wanted to hear the music. In the 1930s, the Bridgeport WPA Orchestra, a statewide unit of the Federal Music Project, gave Thursday night concerts free to the public with amplification provided by the city. Starting in summer 1999 and 2000, and every year since 2007, Seaside Park has been home to Gathering of the Vibes an annual four-day music, camping and arts festival that celebrates the Grateful Dead and showcases a diverse variety of music. Facilities Seaside Park offers many amenities including ball fields, picnic areas, a bathing beach, bath houses, and hiking trails. Parts of the park offering views of the water are wheelchair accessible. Food concessions, an access pier and boat launching facilities are available.

The cultural center is in the restored Barakat building, also known as the \\"Yellow house\\", a historic landmark designed by Youssef Aftimus. History The Barakat house, commissioned by Nicholas Barakat and his wife Victoria, was designed and built in 1924 by Lebanese architect Youssef Aftimus, the architect who designed Beirut's city hall. In 1932 two more stories were added by architect Fouad Kozah, giving the building its current form. Middle-class families lived in the building's eight spacious apartments until the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, when Christian militiamen moved in. The Barakat building became a vantage point for snipers overlooking a combat zone; it ensured the control of the Sodeco crossroad because of its airy architecture and due to its location on the demarcation line that separated the warring factions. The civil war devastated the Barakat building and neglect took its toll on the structure, which became the scene of repetitive acts of vandalism; it was sentenced for demolition in 1997 when the owners decided to sell the property. It was saved by Lebanese heritage activists, particularly architect Mona Hallak who first investigated the house in 1994 during one of her visits with the \\"Association pour la Protection des Sites et Anciennes Demeures au Liban\\" (APSAD), an independent organisation for the protection of historic monuments and buildings. Activists had articles about the structure published in the press almost on a daily basis, wrote petitions, and organized rallies in front of the building. Protestations finally led to the suspension of the decision to destroy the building. In 2003 the municipality of Beirut issued a decree of expropriation for public interest. The decree stated that the Barakat building will be restored to accommodate a memory museum and a cultural center (which will later be known as \\"Beit Beirut\\") with objects tracing the 7000-year history of the city. The decree also provisions the construction of a modern annex to the building on the empty lot around it, which will house offices of the municipality's urban planning department as well as an underground parking lot. The French government provided technical assistance to the Beirut municipality but the cultural specialists who were supposed to visit and counsel on the museum's development were delayed because of the 2006 and 2007 Lebanon conflicts and political instability. The Beit Beirut project was delayed until the return of relative political stability in 2008. The project saw the collaboration between the municipality of Beirut, the City of Paris and the French embassy in Lebanon. In 2009, Lebanese architect Youssef Haider was commissioned by the Beirut municipality to lead the building's restoration works. Even though Haidar had experience in rehabilitation as he had previously worked on the restoration of traditional buildings in downtown Beirut and Tripoli, his selection was contested since he was chosen without having recourse to an open competition. Haidar was assisted by a committee of architects formed by the Municipality of Paris; this committee has worked to develop the rehabilitation project of the museum and is formed by members from a variety of disciplines.The scientific committee is composed of May Hallak, architect Habib Debs (the former president of APSAD), Robert Saliba (who documented the architectural history of Beirut); in addition to representatives of the faculties of architecture in Lebanese universities, historians Serge Yazigi and Carla Edde , Sophie Broome who worked on the memory of the city in Paris, Lynn Maalouf, Frank M√©rim√©e , the former director of the French Institute of the Near-East ifpo. Beit Beirut was slated to open in 2013 but didn't open until April 28, 2016; planning and restoration costs amounted to 18 million US dollars. Beit Beirut will temporarily re-open to the public in August 2017, despite lacking staff, services and direction.https://www.economist.com/news/books-and- arts/21726053-no-one-can-agree-what-beit-beirut-or-what-objects-should-be- display-there A museum of memory in Beirut gets off to a troubled start Description The Barakat building is built in the Ottoman revivalist style with ochre colored Deir el Qamar limestone which gave the building its name. The building consists of two four-story high-end residential blocks in addition to a roof terrace. The two blocks' facades are joined together by an open colonnade adorned with wrought iron work. The blocks are separated by a central atrium connecting to the main entrance to the landscaped garden in the backyard and to the buildings' staircases. The Barakat building stands on Damascus road, where a tramway station once stood. Significance and function During the reconstruction phase that followed the Lebanese civil war, many important buildings were demolished. Activists were able to save a number of individual structures. The Barakat building with its bullet-peppered colonnade and facade became a dominant symbol of the civil war in Beirut. Historians and sociologists have observed that a Lebanese tendency to disremember the civil war and its episodes that don't figure in the Lebanese history curriculum. The last chapter in the Lebanese history textbooks address the withdrawal of French colonial forces from Lebanon in 1946. Lebanese intellectuals and architects lobbying to save the Barakat building argued that the creation of a collective memory and a unified account of the civil war would help the Lebanese to move forward and mend the societal divisions. In 2007, then Beirut's mayor Abdel Menem al-Aris affirmed that the prospected memory museum will showcase the city‚Äôs history and most notably the civil war. Although part the exterior is slated for renovation, the ground and first floors of the Barakat building's ruined facade will be kept in its decrepit state, to serve as a reminder of the city's wartime history. Bullet holes and sniper barricades are to be kept in their original places as well as the belongings of Fouad Chemali, a local dentist who occupied an apartment in the building's first floor since 1943.In the 1990s Mona Hallak had recovered the dentist's instruments, the love letters he exchanged with his Italian wife and his clothes that were left in the apartment after his death in 1973. The dentist's belongings were the subject of a cultural exposition in 2001. The Beit Beirut second floor is to function as a permanent exhibition which recounts the history of Beirut from the nineteenth century onward. The exhibition will include documents, records and the municipality's archive which will be made accessible to the public. The upper floors will be renovated to house a multifunctional hall for temporary cultural, artistic and musical events. Other names Initially known as Barakat building, the structure was dubbed the Yellow house due to the yellow ochre color of the sandstone. The name of the building changed with the alteration of its function; it was called the building of death during the civil war. The cultural center hosted in the building was first called \\"Museum of memory\\" and \\"Beit al Madina\\" (the house of the city) before settling for \\"Beit Beirut\\" (the house of Beirut).

Smith was a moral and religious man and served as Sunday- school superintendent at his Baptist church, Tremont Temple, which he also helped renovate after a fire. =YMCA= When Smith was young, his family's wealth permitted him to travel abroad. At age 25, he attended The Great Exhibition in London, where he marveled at the examples of architecture and culture from around the world. Upon his return home, he was asked to raise funds for a new organization, the Young Men's Christian Association. With the memory of his trip still fresh, he planned a world bazaar, which was staged at the Tremont Temple. Facades of famous buildings around the world were constructed and staffed by well-known local residents who dressed in authentic costumes and sold items imported for the event. The function was spectacularly successful,Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 85 and the YMCA of Boston was the first chapter of the organization in the United States. Smith was elected their first president in 1855. Politics and Family Smith joined other abolitionists including Anson Burlingame to organize the Republican Party in Massachusetts. He supported the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, and attended the inauguration on March 4, 1861, with his wife on their honeymoon.

Smith =Reformer= Smith Brothers did considerable trade with the military. Whenever Franklin observed dishonesty, he felt compelled to report it to authorities, then wrote an account of each offense, had it printed, and distributed the pamphlets throughout the city. He wrote to the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee in 1863 and testified before a Senate committee, resulting in the passage of a law simplifying honest bidding and making manipulation difficult. Smith identified the names of clerks who accepted bribes and created an Analysis of Certain Contracts for the United States Secretary of the Navy. The report showed how specific contractors were able to consistently bid low. Retail Honest Other price bidder bidder item A 100 110 75 The other bidder learns that very few or none of item A item B 50 60 90 will be purchased, so he prices that article artificially = = = low and can price item B ridiculously high as long as total 160 170 165 his total bid is below that of the honest bidder. The naval bureau chiefs were angered that a civilian contractor questioned their integrity and embarrassed them by appearing before Congress and documenting the charges. Instead of eliminating the dishonesty in their subordinates, they targeted the Smith Brothers. Every transaction with the company was examined, and justification was demanded for every error or imperfect item supplied by the company. Despite the scrutiny, Smith was always able to provide a convincing explanation. =Senate committee= In January 1864, a Senate committee chaired by John Parker Hale formed to investigate naval contract fraud. The Navy brass despised Hale since he helped convince Congress to ban flogging in 1850 and grog rations in 1862. Hearings lasted almost four months, with the Smith brothers providing key testimony. The committee's report was not released until June 29, but it was obvious from testimony that it would confirm Smith's accusations and dismiss the Navy's allegations against the Smith brothers. =Arrest= On June 17, 1864, two weeks after the conclusion of the Hale hearings and two weeks before the report was to be made public, both the Smith brothers were arrested. The timing was not an accident; having the principal witnesses in jail would tend to discredit the Senate report when it was released. Early in the morning, a detail of marines grabbed Franklin and dragged him to a waiting boat, where he was transported across the harbor to Georges Island and Fort Warren. They had no warrant, only a telegraphed order from Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy. The marines broke down the door of Smith Brothers & Company, seizing records and correspondence, then did the same at his residence. Company clerks were arrested when they arrived for work the next morning; they were questioned and released. The business was forced to close because the company's books and papers had been taken. When family members went to post bail, they were told that bail had not been set. Next, no one claimed authority to accept bail for a military charge. When bail was finally set, it was an unbelievable half a million dollars. However, Smith was so highly regarded by his fellow businessmen that nearly $1 million was pledged in less than two days. Even then, Smith was denied counsel and visitors. The Massachusetts Congressional delegation, including Charles Sumner, Henry Wilson, Henry L. Dawes, George S. Boutwell, William B. Washburn, Thomas D. Eliot, John Denison Baldwin and John B. Alley went to the office of Navy Secretary Welles and offered to guarantee Smith's court appearance personally, but to no avail. Smith was finally released on July 1, two weeks after his arrest and two days after the Hale report was submitted to Congress. At the time, he still had not been charged with a specific crime, just \\"fraud upon the United States\\" and \\"wilful neglect of duty as a contractor\\" with the Navy. However, his bond was lowered to $20,000. =Court martial= Smith expected to be tried in United States federal courts. Instead, he was ordered to report to a military general court-martial in Philadelphia, distant. During the Civil War, such a surprising number of dishonest contractors had taken advantage of the Army and Navy's need for war material that a legal provision was enacted by Congress on July 17, 1862 which stated that any civilian who supplied material under contract to the military became a member of the military and was subject to court-martial. Once again, the Massachusetts Congressional delegation talked to Welles, but got nowhere. They appealed to President Abraham Lincoln, who read a tribute to Smith's reputation that Senator Sumner had written and the other congressmen had endorsed, then scanned the testimonial to Smith's business integrity, signed by ninety prominent Boston merchants. Lincoln offered to have the case dismissed. Senator Sumner replied, > Mr. President, we trust you will do nothing of the sort. To do that would > leave a stigma on a good man's name. Smith Brothers want it never to be said > that this charge was fixed up through influence. They challenge the fight > but want protection against a conspiracy and a court chosen by their > enemies. We only come to ask you that when the court convicts, as it is > evident it means to do, you will personally review the case.Dahl, Curtis: > \\"Lincoln Saves a Reformer\\" American Heritage Magazine, October 1972 Lincoln agreed and pledged, \\"If I find that men have been pursuing the Smiths, I will lay my long hand upon them, no matter who they are.\\" He then ordered that the court-martial be conducted in Boston and asked Navy Secretary Welles to send him the trial record at the conclusion for his review. Welles was told to delay execution of the sentence until the president gave his approval. =Trial= The trial began September 15, 1864 and lasted four months, with the Navy questioning fewer than a dozen transactions among 12,554 items totalling $1.2 million in government purchases from the Smith Brothers. Only one article -- a delivery of Revely Tin metal was supplied instead of the Banca variety -- shorted the Navy, by $100-200\\\\. Predictably, the trial ended in judgment against the defendants, who were sentenced to two years in prison and fined $25,000. The judgment and sentence were approved by the Secretary of the Navy; all that remained was a presidential sanction. =Presidential action= Charles Sumner again met with President Lincoln on the Smiths' behalf. The president asked Sumner to review the lengthy report from the Navy Secretary which identified the key elements in the court-martial, then render an opinion. Senator Sumner studied the document overnight and wrote an opinion which summarized the treatment of Franklin Smith: > It is hard that citizens enjoying a good name, who had the misfortune to > come into business relations with the Government, should be exposed to such > a spirit; that they should be dragged from their homes, and hurried to a > military prison; that, though civilians, they should be treated as military > offenders; that they should be compelled to undergo a protracted trial by > courtmartial, damaging their good name, destroying their peace, breaking up > their business, and subjecting them to untold expense,‚Äîwhen, at the > slightest touch, the whole case vanishes into thin air, leaving behind > nothing but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its origin. Of > course, the findings and sentence of the Court ought, without delay, to be > set aside. But this is only the beginning of justice. Some positive > reparation should be made to citizens who have been so deeply > injured.Sumner, Charles: The Works of Charles Sumner, Volume 9\\" , page > 357-361 After reflection, the president wrote his decision to Welles, the court- martial board and the Navy: > I am unwilling for the sentence to stand and be executed, to any extent, in > this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence > discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or > fraudulent intent on the part of one of such well-established good character > as is the accused. If the evidence went as far toward establishing a guilty > profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two > hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far > different aspect. That on this contract, involving from one million to > twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should attempt a fraud > which at the most could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one > thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That > they did not, in such a case, strike for greater gains proves that they did > not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, strike at all. The judgment and > sentence are disapproved and declared null, and the accused ordered to be > discharged. Lincoln never got the opportunity to \\"lay my long hand upon them\\" who pursued the Smiths. A few short weeks after the president vacated the sentence, he was killed by an assassin's bullet. =Aftermath= After he was freed by Lincoln, Smith spent some time restoring his business. When the city mourned the death of the president, Smith was asked to lead the gathering at Tremont Temple. He then decided to go abroad and left for Europe. There were three issues at the center of these events: The first was control of the military. The secretary of the Navy is a civilian, but he was manipulated by his assistant secretary, a career officer, into persecuting an innocent man, thereby allowing the military to follow its own agenda. Lincoln's actions shifted the power back to civilian control. Second was the attempt by Congress to suspend the constitutional rights of individual citizens in defiance of the Bill of Rights. The basic constitutional rights of habeas corpus, a jury of peers, and a grand jury hearing before being charged, were not accorded those facing military court-martial. The 1862 Military Contractor Court-Martial act that was the basis for Smith's trial was declared unconstitutional by a federal circuit court in Kentucky in 1866 when considering a case similar to that of Franklin Smith. Finally, the president upheld the rights of an individual against the nearly unlimited resources and power of a federal government agency, which Lincoln called, \\"a fight between a department and a citizen, and the citizen has no fair show\\". Lincoln was protecting an honest man from retribution by those in power. Utopia The Long Depression of 1873‚Äì79 resulted in the unemployment of thousands of former industrial workers. Smith authored four articles which were published in the Boston Advertiser in 1877, and the Boston Board of Aid to Land Ownership was formed that year \\"to divert workers from surplus in manufacturing to Tillage of the Earth--the basis of all industries, and the primary source of all wealth\\".Howell, Benita J.: \\"Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Rugby, Tennessee\\" Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003 The board selected a committee to investigate possible locations for a settlement. After learning that the Cincinnati Southern Railroad was constructing a rail line to the area, they chose the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. Smith, who was president of the board, travelled to Tennessee in 1878 and selected a site, engaged a surveyor to plot the town, and an architect to design a hotel there. The location, which Smith named Plateau City, was the most beautiful he found. It overlooked river gorges, contained broad hills and had sweeping mountain vistas, but it was seven long miles from the railroad. By this time, the depression was ending, and unemployment was falling. A few Bostonians were reconsidering their investment in the venture, so Smith found additional investors through Thomas Hughes, the English social reformer. Hughes wanted to establish a utopian settlement for younger sons of English gentry which was classless, because class conventions in England prevented those born into high society from becoming tradesmen or farmers. In 1879, the London Board of Aid to Land Ownership became the primary investors in the Tennessee project and renamed the colony Rugby. Smith thought that the key to growth was to become a resort, where guests would buy land and settle there. Hughes disagreed and refused to spend time or money on tourist endeavors. When Smith realized that his ideas was being ignored, he divested himself of the project in 1880 and took another trip abroad. St. Augustine =Travel= As a prosperous man, Smith enjoyed traveling throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, studying architecture and the history of past civilizations. During his lifetime, he took more than a dozen trips across the Atlantic, and purchased numerous works of art and artifacts. Smith's in-laws were Quakers, but they were financially able to construct and travel to a winter home near St. Augustine, Florida after the Civil War. Following a trip to Florida to visit his wife's family, Smith decided to build his own winter residence there, but wanted his house to stand out, both in design and composition. On his next tour abroad in 1882, Smith traveled through southern Spain and found his inspiration when he toured the 12th- century Moorish Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. The remainder of the excursion was spent searching Spain, Egypt and Morocco for decorations and furniture.Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 87 On Lake Geneva in Switzerland, Smith observed the construction of a Ch√¢teau which used sand from the lake bottom to make concrete; thus he solved his question of building material. Villa Zorayda in the 1900s =Residence= In December 1883, Smith engaged a Boston mason to come to Florida to help build a special structure. They experimented making concrete blocks that used crushed coquina along with Portland cement. Satisfied with the results, they began to construct the Villa Zorayda cast in courses ten inches (254 mm) tall. After 48 hours, the concrete had hardened enough to pour the next course. The process was repeated until the desired height was reached, and the resulting structure was nearly monolithic. The material grew harder with age; after one month, it was as hard as building stone. The outside of the Villa Zorayda appears as three separate sections. To maintain structural integrity, there are railroad rails within the walls that extend the entire width of the erection.\\"Franklin W. Smith\\" Dr. Bronson's St. Augustine History The Zorayda was not a copy of the Alhambra; it was an amalgamation of Moorish style.\\"History of the Villa Zorayda\\" Villa Zorayda Museum =Revolution= Moorish Revival architecture became the style of choice in St. Augustine. Across the country, building construction utilizing poured concrete became all the rage and replaced more costly brick in many applications. In 1883, Henry Morrison Flagler and his new, young wife traveled to St. Augustine for their honeymoon and were impressed with Villa Zorayda. Flagler offered to buy it for his bride, but Smith would not sell. However, he planted the seed of St. Augustine's and Florida's future in Flagler's mind.Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 95 Flagler returned to St. Augustine in 1885 and made Smith an offer. If Smith could raise $50,000, Flagler would invest $150,000 and they would build a hotel together. Perhaps fortunately for Smith, he couldn't come up with the funds,Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 101 so Flagler began construction of the 540-room Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel by himself, but spent several times his original estimate. Smith helped train the masons on the mixing and pouring techniques he used on Zorayda.Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 105 Casa Monica Hotel, renamed the Cordova Hotel c. 1891 =Hotel= Henry Flagler sold Smith the land on which Smith built the Casa Monica Hotel in 1887. The Casa Monica is an impressive five-story structure, wide with towers on each end rising , topped with tiled roofs. There are architectural features including turrets, balconies, parapets, ornate railings, cornices, arches, and battlements on the exterior, all composed of poured concrete and coquina. The flagpole in the center of the building serves a dual purpose: it is also a lightning rod. The hotel contained 138 guest rooms, including 14 suites. Several suites are located in the towers, with up to 3 bedrooms, and occupy 2 to 4 floors. The hotel opened on January 1, 1888 but Smith had financial troubles and was forced to sell it to Flagler after the winter season ended\\"Casa Monica Hotel History\\" Casa Monica Hotel for $325,000. Smith built a shopping arcade across from the hotels where the hotel guests could spend money.Nolan, David: Fifty Feet in Paradise, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich Publishers, 1984, page 117 Pompeia After selling the Casa Monica, Smith left St. Augustine and moved to Saratoga Springs, New York. He wanted to create something educational to add culture to the town instead of gambling and horse racing for which it was known. Beginning in 1888, Smith built a full-scale reconstruction of a compilation of villas described in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel, The Last Days of Pompeii. The structure was wide and deep, for a total of .Smith, Franklin W.: \\"Design and Prospectus for a National Gallery of History of Art at Washington\\" Page 12, Gibson Brothers 1891 It was completed in 1889 and named Pompeia, or House of Pansa and furnished in the style of that era, 79 A.D. Smith commissioned artists and historians to copy the architecture, statues and paintings that would present a picture of the lifestyle of a Roman nobleman nearly two thousand years ago. Many of the artifacts and sculptures he purchased in Europe were displayed in the Pompeia. The structure became a popular attraction for visitors, drawing over 60,000 people in the first four years. Smith wanted all schools in the region to visit Pompeia each year. His plan for the Acropolis and National Galleries was refined during his time there.Berry, Jo: \\"Reconstructing the history of the Pompeia, Saratoga Springs\\" Blogging Pompeii, August 16, 2009 Stupendous scheme Franklin Smith travelled Europe extensively during his lifetime, studying the great architectural achievements and art from bygone eras. For one hundred years, the United States had directed its efforts toward industrial and commercial development while neglecting cultural development. Because America had no equivalent to the great national museums abroad, Smith began to form a plan for Washington, D.C. that would include the best work from eight major civilizations in history. Design & Prospectus for the National Gallery In the Spring of 1890, noted architect James Renwick, Jr. was in Florida working on the bell tower design for the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine. One evening, he and his wife listened to Smith deliver a speech to garner support for his Design and Prospectus for a National Gallery of History of Art at Washington. Renwick endorsed the idea and offered to provide drawings, plans and illustrations for the project. Smith gratefully accepted and the firm of 'Renwick, Aspinwall & Russell' spent six months completing their contribution.Smith, Franklin W.: \\"Design and Prospectus for a National Gallery of History of Art at Washington\\" Page 10, Gibson Brothers 1891 In 1891, Smith paid to print his Design and Prospectus... and distributed it widely at major cities in the northeast. Smith delivered a series of lectures, beginning at the Boston Art Club, then the Maryland Institute College of Art at Baltimore, Philadelphia's Drexel Institute, and finally New York University on December 17, 1892.\\"FOR A NATIONAL GALLERY; OUTLINE OF FRANKLIN W. SMITH'S STUPENDOUS SCHEME\\" New York Times, December 17, 1892 However, the Panic of 1893 and depression that followed forced Smith to delay his plan until the world's economies began to recover in 1898. Smith took every opportunity to talk about his grand scheme wherever he was, and he travelled constantly. He was a charming, enthusiastic speaker, and he made his lectures interesting. He was able to persuade many influential people to endorse his vision, and gained widespread support. Smith insisted that all he needed was $10 million and of land. He lobbied both the House and the Senate, and made certain every member had a copy of his Design and Prospectus. He kept a file of 225 newspaper articles from 51 cities in 25 states that endorsed his plan. Another file held letters of support from politicians, educators, businessmen, scholars, museums and architects. Halls of the Ancients in 1907 =Prototype= Smith designed a museum in Washington D.C. and Samuel Walter Woodward, founder of the Woodward & Lothrop department store chain, financed the construction at 1312 New York Avenue. It was built as an example of the historical and cultural displays that Smith advocated in his \\"Design and Prospectus\\". The Halls of the Ancients opened on February 4, 1899, with the entrance based on Great Hypostyle Hall, Karnak. Besides Egypt, the museum contained Greek and Roman sections that included furnishings and works of art that were historically accurate reproductions. The New York Times called it \\"A novel, artistic and educational institution\\".\\"Nucleus of a National Institution Opened in Washington\\" New York Times, February 5, 1899Baedeker, Karl: \\"Halls of the Ancients\\" The United States: with an excursion into Mexico, 1904, pages 322-323 =Petition= Smith found a like-minded man in Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar, who presented Smith's petition to Congress on February 12, 1900. It was identified as Senate document number 209 by the 56th Congress, First Session, and 5,000 copies were printed. Unfortunately for Smith, the United States was engaged in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and Senator Hoar was one of President William McKinley's strongest critics. The majority of politicians were so preoccupied with the war that they paid scant attention to an issue of culture. When Hoar died in 1904, Smith's plan died with him.Williams, Paul Kelsey: \\"Scenes from the Past‚Ä¶\\" InTowner magazine, December 2004 With no lawmaker to shepherd the legislation, it never made it out of committee.

In the 1900 census, Franklin Smith's marital status was listed as \\"widowed\\",\\"1900 United States Federal Census\\" Ancestry.com, Franklin W. Smith but Laura Smith did not die until 1915. The year 1906 ended Smith's dreams when the banks foreclosed on his properties in St. Augustine, Washington, D.C. and Saratoga Springs. Smith died in anonymity and poverty five years later, disowned by his family and residing with his older sister Mary in Boston.\\"1910 United States Federal Census\\" Ancestry.com, Franklin W. Smith He was buried in the Smith family plot of Mount Auburn Cemetery at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Halls of the Ancients eventually was demolished and the site became a parking garage. During Prohibition, Villa Zorayda was a speakeasy with casino gambling, but today it is a museum. Pompeia was partially destroyed by a fire in 1926, became a Shriners Hall, and today is occupied by an advertising agency.

It is located south of the city centre on the medieval bridge over the River Calder. It is the only survivor of four chantries in Wakefield and the oldest and most ornate of the surviving bridge chapels in England. Others are at St Ives (Cambridgeshire), Rotherham, Derby and Bradford-on-Avon. The chapel has had three west fronts, the original medieval fa√ßade having been removed to Kettlethorpe Hall in 1832. The medieval bridge is a scheduled ancient monument. History View of the Chantry Chapel, 1773, by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm Wakefield had four chantry chapels, three of which dated from the 13th century. They were built outside the medieval town on the roads leading to Leeds, Dewsbury, York and Doncaster. The Chantry of St John the Baptist was on Northgate, the road to Leeds, where Wakefield Grammar School stands today. The Chapel of St Mary Magdalene was on Westgate where it crossed the Ings Beck on the road to Dewsbury. St Swithun's Chantry Chapel, on the York road, was near Clarke Hall. In the 14th century the Chantry Chapel of St Mary the Virgin was built on the medieval bridge across the River Calder on the road to Doncaster and the south. Wakefield's medieval nine-arched bridge is long, was built in stone between 1342 and 1356. It replaced an earlier wooden structure on the site of an ancient ford. The chapel on the bridge was licensed in 1356. The Battle of Wakefield was fought about a mile south of the bridge in 1460 and the Earl of Rutland was killed near the bridge while attempting to escape. The chapel was used for worship until the Reformation and Abolition of Chantries Acts when all Wakefield's four chantry chapels were closed. The bridge chapel survived because it is a structural element of the bridge. After closure it was used as a warehouse, library, office and cheese shop and survived bridge widening in 1758 and 1797. The bridge and its chapel were painted by artists including J.M.W. Turner whose watercolour dates from 1793. Chantry Chapel facade = Restoration and rebuilding = The chapel was transferred to the Church of England in 1842 and the Yorkshire Architectural Society, influenced by the Oxford Movement, persuaded to undertake its restoration. The society, keen to restore medieval ecclesiastical remains, adopted designs by George Gilbert Scott. Restoration costing approximately ¬£2,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), was carried out, resulting in the complete reconstruction of the chapel above pavement level. The new west front differed slightly from its medieval predecessor. Scott is perceived as having made two errors, the first was being persuaded to completely replace the old west front. The second was having the new fa√ßade carved from Caen stone, which crumbled in the polluted urban atmosphere and was completely replaced in 1939 in gritstone by ecclesiastical architect Sir Charles Nicholson. The original richly carved medieval fa√ßade was moved to Kettlethorpe Hall, where it became the frontage to a folly boathouse. The chapel opened for Anglican worship in 1848 and was used as the parish church of the newly formed ecclesiastical district of St Mary until a church was built in 1854. The bridge chapel became a chapel-of-ease and services were held irregularly. St Mary's merged with St Andrew's, Eastmoor in the 1960s and the impoverished parish struggled with the chapel's upkeep. In the 1980s it seemed likely the chapel would be declared redundant by the Church of England. In January 2000 a parish boundary change brought the chantry into the care of Wakefield Cathedral. Structure The chapel which projects to the east side of the bridge is built into on a small island in the river and its base is a structural element of the bridge. It is rectangular in plan and was built of ashlar sandstone possibly from a quarry at Goodybower. The chapel measures by . It measures to the top of the battlements at the eastern end. The chapel is at street level and has a lower chamber, the sacristy, accessed by a spiral staircase at the east end. =Exterior= Wakefield Bridge and Chantry Chapel, Philip Reinagle, 1793. The chapel's west front has buttresses at either end and has three narrow doorways. Its fa√ßade is divided into five elaborately carved panels. The panels originally represented the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Resurrection, the Ascension and the Coronation of the Virgin but the fifth panel was replaced by the Descent of the Holy Ghost when it was restored. There are three bays with square headed windows with \\"flamboyant\\" tracery. The chapel has octagonal corner pinnacles and at the north eastern corner there is a small embattled octagonal turret with a small bell tower which originally contained two bells. =Interior= In the north east corner a newel staircase leads to the roof. A staircase also descends to a small crypt in the basement of the building. Four of the seven traceried windows have stained glass, the east window, two south windows and one north window. Friends of Wakefield Chantry Chapel The \\"Friends of Wakefield Chantry Chapel\\" was formed in 1991 by members of the Wakefield Historical Society, Wakefield Civic Society and members of St Andrew's Church to raise funds to repair the chapel roof and re-point the stonework. A programme of conservation work has since been carried out with the approval of English Heritage. The work included roof repairs, re-wiring and the installation of heating. Renewal to the external stonework cost ¬£30,000 in a project by William Anelay Ltd. Six new carved stone heads were made for the south side of the building. At the suggestion of architect David Greenwood, the Bishop of Wakefield, the Lady St Oswald of Nostell Priory, the Rt Hon Walter Harrison and Canon Bryan Ellis allowed their features to be sculpted by stonemason John Schofield. The fifth head is that of a founder of the Friends, Ray Perraudin, and the sixth one of Anelay's workmen. The friends have conserved the internal stone heads whose age is unknown.

Staphyloxanthin also acts as a virulence factor. It has an antioxidant action that helps the microbe evade death by reactive oxygen species produced by the host immune system. The pigment staphyloxanthin gave the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus a yellow color. When comparing a normal strain of S. aureus with a strain modified to lack staphyloxanthin, the wildtype pigmented strain was more likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical such as hydrogen peroxide than the mutant strain was. Colonies of the two strains were also exposed to human neutrophils. The mutant colonies quickly succumbed while many of the pigmented colonies survived. Wounds on mice were inoculated with the two strains. The pigmented strains created lingering abscesses. Wounds with the unpigmented strains healed quickly. These tests suggest that the staphyloxanthin may be key to the ability of S. aureus to survive immune system attacks. Drugs designed to inhibit the bacterium's production of the staphyloxanthin may weaken it and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol, a drug developed in the context of cholesterol-lowering therapy was shown to block S. aureus pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model.

Of the 300 Belgian painters, sculptors, engravers, and architects who traveled to Italy to study during the period 1830‚Äì1914, only five are thought to have been women; Bovie is one of three whose presence there is attested with certainty. She visited Rome, Florence, Naples, and Venice, obtaining permission to copy paintings in the galleries of FlorenceChristine A. Dupont, Mod√®les italiens et traditions nationales: les artistes belges en Italie, 1830-1914 (Institut historique belge de Rome, 2005), p. 222. as she did later in Paris at the Louvre, where in 1858 she reproduced The Raft of the Medusa by Th√©odore G√©ricault.Alexia Creusen, Femmes artistes en Belgique (Harmattan, 2007), p. 66. Bovie painted several works on canvas drawing on Italian subject matter, including Neapolitan Woman with Child (1857),Dupont, Mod√®les italiens, p. 563. and exhibited some of these at the 1866 salon in Brussels and the 1879 salon in Antwerp.Dictionnaire des femmes belges, p. 75. Her father was a rentier capitalist, and Bovie was able to remain financially independent and unmarried throughout her life. She lived in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode and Ixelles, suburbs of Brussels that were favored by artists. She built a grand maison at 208 rue de Tr√¥ne, Ixelles, and had Mus√©e Bovie carved into one of the foundation stones. She lived there for many years with Louise, who also never married, and used the house as exhibition space. Her cousin F√©lix Bovie, a painter, and the sculptor Antoine-F√©lix Bour√© also showed their works there.Ten Bokum, \\"Art&fact;\\" In an 1873 English-language guide describing a six-day walking tour of Brussels, the Mus√©e Bovie was noted as near the Mus√©e Wiertz.The Stranger's Guide to Brussels and Its Environs (Brussels, 1873, 5th ed.), p. 7 online. Bovie persisted with history painting at a time when it had become unfashionable,Dictionnaire des femmes belges, p. 75. but her subject matter shows great variety. Her economic and personal independence enabled her to focus her energies on her career as a painter. The art historian Anne-Marie ten Bokum has conjectured that Bovie was a lesbian.Ten Bokum, \\"Art&fact;\\" Virginie and Louise had a third sister, Hortence or Hortense, who married Fran√ßois-Joachim-Alexandre Rouen and appears to have outlived him and both her sisters.Legal records pertaining to the estates of Virginie and Hortense, whose full name is given as Jos√©phine-Fran√ßoise-Hortense Bovie, appear in P. de Paepe, Pasinomie: collection compl√®te des lois, d√©crets, arr√™t√©s et r√®glements g√©n√©raux qui peuvent √™tre invoqu√©s en Belgique (Brussels, 1892), pp. 141‚Äì142 online. Upon Bovie's death, the state declined the bequest of her mus√©e and allowed its contents to be auctioned off.Dictionnaire des femmes belges, p. 75. A catalogue for the auction, held in February 1889, was compiled by Jules de Brauwere.Jules de Brauwere, Catalogue de Mus√©e Bovie qui sera vendu par suite du d√©c√®s de Mademoiselle Virginie Bovie (1889).

In addition to her grand historical and religious paintings, some of which were official commissions, her diverse oeuvre includes scenes of contemporary life, floral arrangements, and portraits. Unlike the large-scale paintings, the genre works appeal to a bourgeois sensibility and permit a female perspective.Ten Bokum, \\"Art&fact;\\" In the first decade of the 21st century, The Crucifixion and Descent from the Cross were still on view at the √âglise Saints-Jean-et-Nicolas at Schaerbeek in Brussels.Creusen, Femmes artistes en Belgique, p. 129. These early paintings show the influence of Wiertz and masters of the Flemish Baroque such as Rubens and de Crayer.Ten Bokum, \\"Art&fact;\\" Bovie exhibited The Visitation and The Iconoclasts at the Cathedral of Antwerp at the Antwerp salon of 1861. A reviewer remarked: > They show evidence of substantial studies, a good grasp of composition, > great feeling for color‚Äîall qualities which are grounds for astonishment in > a woman and in a century when painting shines with more grace than power.Ils > t√©moignent de fortes √©tudes, d'une bonne entente de la composition, d'un > grand sentiment de la couleur, toutes qualit√©s qui ont lieu d'√©tonner chez > une femme, et dans un si√®cle o√π la peinture brille plus par la gr√¢ce que par > la force: G.-J.

Its Ancient cathedral was so utterly destroyed it hasn't even been located. The present √âauze Cathedral, dedicated to St. Luperculus, was built around 500 and became co-cathedral of the successor see Archdiocese of Auch in 1864.  History  Elusa, capital of the Gallic Late Roman province of Novempopulania since Emperor Diocletian split if off from Gallia Aquitania, was also made its Metropolitan Archbishopric, plausibly soon after. Eauze remained known as Elusa in the early Middle Ages. Its suffragan sees were, as attested in 506 at a council in Agde : Diocese of Auch, Diocese of Aire, Diocese of Bazas, Diocese of Dax, Diocese of Comminges, Diocese of Couserans, Diocese of Lectoure, Diocese of Lescar, Diocese of Oloron and Diocese of Tarbes. It 551 the Metropolitan hosted a synod in Euze attended by eight of his suffragans. Historians dispute if the city itself was wrecked by Saracen incursion from Iberia in 721‚Äì722 or by 9th century Viking raids, but the bishopric was abandoned by mid 8th century. The see may have been moved for mainly military reasons, around 850.Structurae, Cath√©drale Saint-Luperc, retrieved: 2017-01-03.. It was suppressed in 879. The see was moved from Eauze to Auch, the territory becoming part of the diocese of Auch, whose Bishop Airardus was hence promoted and granted the title of Archbishop in 879.  Residential Archbishops  The first historical mention of an (anonymous) bishop of Eauze is at the Council of Arles (314). Tradition assigns its foundation to a Saint Paternus, consecrated by Saint Saturninus, the apostle of the present Gers department. His four alleged successors (Saint Servandus, Saint Optatus, Saint Pompidianus and Taurinus) are only known from an AD 1106 document from the church of Auch (its successor), which claims the last transferred the see to Auch after the Vandals would have wrecked the city and ignores the later Metropolitans (except perhaps confounding Taurinus). Apart from those, the Metropolitans and their (often disputed) historical record dates are : * Mamertinus recorded in 314 * Clarus in 506 * Leontius in 511 * Saint Aspasius first in 533 - last in 551 * Labanus first in 573 - death circa 585 * Desiderius = D√©sid√®re (circa 585 ‚Äì ?614) * Leodomundus in 614 * Senoc(us) first term until 622 * Palladius in 626 * Sidocus (if not identical to Senoc) in 627 * Senoc(us) (or Sidocus) in 627, presumably second term until death 660 * Scupilius = Scupilio in 673/675) * Paterne = Paternus (? ‚Äì 722) * Taurin(us) (? ‚Äì 829?) would have translated the see to - and become Bishop of Auch (836? ‚Äì ?).

The FT-817 is a QRP transceiver.Review on eham http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/1184 Technical description =CAT Interface= A serial port with a wide range of commands is provided. =Circuit description= The following circuit description is an extract from the service manualYaesu FT-817 Service Manual RX signals may be input via a front BNC connector or a rear UHF SO-239 connector (Yaesu calls it a type \\"M\\" connector) using a relay on the PA unit. The selection has to be made per band (HF, 6, 2 m or 70 cm) using menu selection. The BNC connector is the antenna connector chosen when the relay is bypassed. A 70cm signal path goes through a high pass filter network, through the RF directional coupler/power detector (not on rx) to a low pass filter to a PIN-diode. In rx mode, these are turned off. The rx signal then passes through a DAN235U; this is a dual diode and when in UHF rx mode, the appropriate diode is turned on, passing the 70 cm signal through and the signal then leaves the PA board. On the MAIN circuit board the 70 cm rx signal enters a DAP236U. This dual diode get its current from the PA unit and when 70 cm rx mode is active one of the diodes is turned on. Rx signal goes through a device consisting of 2 back-to- back diodes providing protection for the receiver's front end. The output of the preamplifier is sent to a helical resonator filter. The output of the filtered and amplified 70 cm path is passed through and coupled into the receive mixer. For 70 cm receive, PIN diode bias is provided to the PA unit, through the MAIN unit and then through an RF-decoupler network, a parallel- output shift register. A 2m signal goes to a relay and then the signals are diplexed, with 2m and < going to a lo-pass filter. The signal gets diplexed again using a hi-pass filter, separating out the 2 m signal from the HF-6 meter signal path. The rx signal passes through the VHF directional coupler/power detector (not used in rx) to a lo-pass filter and then passes by 2 PIN diodes (both HSU277). These diodes and related components form T/R isolation switches that operate similar to that of the 70 cm front end. Rx signal passes through the half which is not used for 70 cm and then to the RX RF output and is then passes to the MAIN unit. Here the signal enters and then passes through a transformer, along with a varactor and related components and forms an electrically-tuned filter/matching network, the 2 meter preamplifier. The output of the preamplifier goes through 2 electronically tuned transistors. Finally, the output goes through to get to the rx mixer. For 2 m rx, the PIN diode bias is provided by the PA unit to 2 m preamplifier. Aircraft band Rx path (108-154 MHz) is the same as that of the 2 m path on the PA unit. On the MAIN unit, it goes through the same part as the 2 m signal, but it then goes through the diode portion that was not used for 2 m into an electronically tuned bandpass filter. The output passes through the rx mixer. The PIN diode bias is provided by the PA unit and flows through the primary transistor. On the output, current is provided and goes through the secondary transistor. Both current paths are completed using the aircraft band rx preamplifier. WFM broadcast band rx path (76-108 MHz) is identical to the 2 m path on the PA unit. On the MAIN unit it passes through the same portion as the 2 m signal, then through a HSC277 diode. This signal then goes into pin 10 of a Sony CXA1611 FM Receiver IC. The IC has a front end, mixer, IF and demodulation and provides received audio. In order to suppress local oscillator leakage and provide a slight amount of image rejection, a varactor and a coil provide one stage of tracking bandpass filtering. Typical for single-chip receivers, the dynamic range of this receiver is poor. When using a large antenna, expect overload/intermod problems. HF and 6 meter receive path. After relay the signal is diplexed via a low-pass filter. At this point 2 m, aircraft and WFM are diplexed. Continuing the signal passes through a low pass filter, continues through the RF Directional Coupler/Power Detector (not used in rx) through low pass filters selected by relays as appropriate for current rx frequency. The combination of lo- and hi-pass filters provide broadband bandpass filtering to the rx front end. For 6 m the hi-pass filter includes a preamplifier (always used on 6 m rx and not affected by the IPO menu setting). The appropriate high pass filter output is selected with a PIN diode with logic levels. The output from the PIN diodes are routed to the MAIN unit. Here the rx signal is applied to dual PIN diode modules (type DAP236U). One path routes the signal directly between the two modules and the other path passes the signal through a 10 db pad - the pad that is switched in as a menu item. The output is then passed through a simple lo-pass filter to another DAP236U. One of the outputs is applied to a preamplifier and the other is applied to a diode, bypassing the preamplifier. The output of the diode is applied to an IF trap. The purpose of which is to prevent 68.33 MHz energy from the antenna from getting into the 1st IF. The HF receive signal is routed to the receive mixer. =Technical Specifications= *RX Freq coverage: 100 kHz-30 MHz, 50 MHz-54 MHz, 76 MHz-108 MHz (WFM), 108 MHz-154 MHz, 420 MHz-450 MHz *TX Freq coverage: 160 - 6 Meters, 2 Meters, 70 Centimeters (Amateur bands only), 5.1675 MHz Alaskan Emergency Frequency (USA model only), 5 fixed channels (USA model FT-817ND only) 5.332 MHz, 5.348 MHz, 5.368 MHz, 5.373 MHz, 5.405 MHz *Power consumption: 13.8 V DC @ transmit 2A, @ receive 450mA. *Operating voltage range: within 8 -16V (AA alkanine batteries: 12V; Nicad battery: 9,6V) *Tuning steps: 100 Hz AM, FM, WFM; 10 Hz SSB, CW switchable *Dimensions 13.5 x 4 x 16.8 cm *Weight appx. 1.2 kg with alkaline batteries and flex antenna *Emission: CW, SSB, AM, FM, Digital mode *Power output: 5W (SSB,CW,FM), 1.5W (AM, carrier) @ 13.8V *Carrier suppression: better than -40 dB below rated output *Unwanted sideband suppression: better than -60 dB below peak output *Spurious: better than ‚Äì 40 dB below peak output *Distortion: better than -31 dB below peak output *Transmitter freq response: 350 ‚Äì 2700 Hz (-6 dB) *Stability: ¬±0.3 ppm/1 hour @25 ¬∞C, after warmup *Ant output impedance: 50 Ohms unbalanced (front BNC connector, rear UHF (SO-239) connector) *Microphone output impedance: 200-10k Ohms (Nominal: 600 Ohms) *Receive sensitivity: 100 kHz ‚Äì 29.999 MHz continuous better than 0.7 microV for S/N 10 dB *Image rejection: HF/50 MHz: 70 dB, 144/430 MHz: 60 dB *IF rejection: -60 dB (all freq) *Selectivity: -6 dB 2.2 kHz, -60 dB 4.5 kHz *Audio output: 1 W @ 10% THD, 8 Ohms Accessories *Shoulder Strap *Carrying case soft vinyl *YHA-63 flex whip antenna for 50/144/430 MHz *FBA-28 Battery case for AA batteries *E-DC-6 DC cable *MH-31A8J hand mic *FNB 72 and 85 internal NiCd/NiMH 9.8V battery packs 1000/1400mAh *NC-72B Battery pack charger *TCXO stability unit *DTMF mic *Cat interface and Packet cable *ATAS 25 portable manually tuned antenna = Suitable Antenna Tuners = *LDG Z817 automatic antenna tuner *Elecraft T1 miniature automatic antenna tuner Emtech ZM-2 small, lightweight manual Z-match tuner for balanced and unbalanced feedlines Known Weaknesses Vulnerable final transistors in non-ND model!

At least 80 people were confirmed to have died, with other accounts putting this figure closer to 140. Background Owing to the country's lack of roads outside major cities, ferries and river transport are a major component of transport in the DRC. The country, which is comparable in size to the whole of Western Europe, has just a few hundred kilometres of paved roads outside the cities. The disaster occurred on the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River, in the western Bandundu province, east of the capital, Kinshasa. The boat was travelling to Kinshasa from the town of Mushie in Bandundu's western Kwilu district, which is from the city of Bandundu, the capital of that province. The government stated that boat owners in the DRC were frequently negligent and that adherence to insurance rules and maintenance schedules was often lax. Fatal riverine accidents are frequent in the DRC and are often blamed on overloading. Several decades of conflict in the region have degraded the country's infrastructure, leaving aircraft and boats as the best or only option for travel. According to Agence France-Presse, boating accidents are made more likely by the poor state of the signage in navigable channels, the lack of signal lights on vessels and the inexperience of pilots. The situation is compounded because most vessels fail to meet basic safety standards. Accident =Cause= According to the government, the boat capsized after hitting a rock. The boat was badly overloaded according to police, and many passengers were unable to swim. Police initially attributed the cause of the capsize to rough weather, although the government also said that low water levels on the river due to the dry season may have been the cause, leading to a higher chance of boats snagging or hitting submerged sandbanks. =Date and location= Conflicting accounts have been given for the date and exact location of the accident, with Information Minister Lambert Mende Omalanga stating on 2010 that it took place on Tuesday 2010 at Mangutuka river post, about from Kinshasa; he earlier stated it took place on Wednesday, from Kinshasa. Another account from Mende stated it occurred near Maluku district, about from Kinshasa. Several secondary reports have said it occurred on Wednesday, . =Rescue efforts= The DRC Navy and local Red Cross personnel travelled to the scene of the accident to assist in the search for survivors and in collecting the dead. Fatalities A provisional police death toll stated 138 people died. The Transport Ministry toll was 80 confirmed dead and 76 known survivors, although both figures were thought likely to rise with searches for survivors, and due to the presence of many unrecorded passengers on the boat. The official manifest listed \\"about 180 passengers\\" according to the government. According to one report, the boat was carrying \\"about 200 passengers\\" in all. An unnamed official in the local governor's office said that 140 people were dead. Another unnamed source stated that just two children were believed to have survived the disaster.

National Geographic has ranked Myrtle Beach Boardwalk number three in the United States, while Travel and Leisure ranked the boardwalk number two. Description The northern section, wide with a raised wooden deck design, runs from Pier 14 to Plyler Park, the location of \\"Hot Summer Nights\\", with live music twice a week during the summer, and weekly attractions that include a \\"Kids Carnival\\", bagpipes, and a Dixieland band. The middle section, from Plyler Park to the former site of Myrtle Beach Pavilion, has \\"a carnival atmosphere accompanied by restaurants, bars and gift shops\\". The Southern Promenade, from the former Pavilion to 2nd Avenue Pier, city officials describe as a \\"meandering oceanfront park\\" with benches and landscaping. The 2nd Avenue Pier is the location of weekly fireworks. The contractor responsible for constructing the MB Boardwalk Project is M.B. Kahn Construction Co., Inc., according to city officials, used close to 770,000 board-feet of lumber, 555,000 screws, and 300,000 nails. The city contributed 600 palmetto trees and 50,000 beach grass seedlings.Jake Spring, \\"Myrtle Beach boardwalk, budget get attention\\", The Sun News, May 25, 2010. History Myrtle Beach had a wooden boardwalk in the 1930s. After being upgraded with concrete in 1940, with plans to expand it delayed by World War II, it was destroyed by Hurricane Hazel in 1954. All that remained was a concrete walkway between 9th Avenue North and 11th Avenue North, later renamed Mr. Joe White Avenue.Lorena Anderson, \\"Myrtle Beach Boardwalk: Building a beach icon\\", The Sun News, March 15, 2008. The 1999 Pavilion Area Master Plan included a boardwalk. When the Pavilion closed in 2006 after 58 years, area merchants wanted an attraction to replace it. A mile-long boardwalk had been discussed for several years, but the estimated cost was $10 million, and even if construction started in 2007, it would not be complete until 2010. A major storm could also damage the new attraction. Sebok said \\"Most tourists expect a boardwalk ... and we really don't have one to speak of.\\" Dawn Bryant, \\"Owners wait for the walk: Many see the idea as a replacement for The Pavilion\\", The Sun News, April 4, 2006. The city allocated $285,000 for design, and The LandArt Co. made preliminary sketches that included benches and planters.Dawn Bryant, \\"Council shells out for design, permits for MB boardwalk\\", The Sun News, July 30, 2006. By 2007, the cost estimate had risen to $12 million and the start date was Fall 2008. The city was considering several payment methods. City manager Tom Leath wanted a tax district where businesses nearby would pay more because they would benefit more, while some believed the entire city should contribute since the boardwalk would be good for everyone. Opponents of the tax district wondered if small businesses could pay. Some people worried about crime and vagrants.Lisa Fleisher, \\"Downtown may fund boardwalk: Project's neighbors would pay more\\", The Sun News, April 8, 2007. A design with \\"a traditional wood-plank walkway\\" and \\"a meandering concrete sidewalk ... with wooden crosswalks to the beach, colorful shade sails and public parks\\" was presented to city council Aug. 14, 2007, but funding was still not set. Burroughs & Chapin, which had torn down the Pavilion building and cleared the site of the amusement park over the previous year,Dawn Bryant, \\"Demolition tears into tradition: Plan for Pavilion land remains a mystery\\", The Sun News, Dec. 6, 2006. agreed to pay for the section across the Pavilion site, using a design matching that in the other areas.Lisa Fleisher and Jan A. Igoe, \\"Boardwalk hinges on funds: Design gains support, but some downtown businesses balk at tax\\", The Sun News, August 15, 2007. Myrtle Beach Sky Wheel Groundbreaking took place in September 2009, despite a dispute between the city and Burroughs & Chapin, with a question over whether the company would pay for its section. Nevertheless, the company supported the boardwalk and expected its plans for the Pavilion site would benefit. The cost of the project had been cut in half,Monique Newton, \\"B&C;, Myrtle Beach move ahead on boardwalk\\", The Sun News, September 21, 2009. mainly due to the economic slowdown, making companies more eager to get work. A controversial sales tax for tourism promotion has made it possible, without raising property taxes in the area, to pay off bonds the city issued to finance the project. The boardwalk was finished from 14th Avenue to 4th Avenue early in April. The boardwalk opened in May 2010 with a ribbon-cutting held May 15 as part of the Beach Music Festival. It attracted people from the area and across the country who had not been downtown in years. The southernmost section, beyond 4th Avenue, was not complete until June. On December 1, 2011, the Myrtle Beach Community Appearance Board saw plans for a new restaurant and park north of 14th Avenue North, which could include an extension of the boardwalk, but it was not known who would pay to add to the boardwalk. On January 24, 2012, the city council agreed to allow alleys to be moved, creating space for the new park. Coastal Dining planned to build the Banditos Mexican restaurant where the Breakwater Inn was before its demolition, and to pay part of the $420,000 cost of the boardwalk extension as well as connecting 15th Avenue North to Ocean Boulevard. The extension was completed in 2013. On November 8, 2012 at a meeting of people involved in making the boardwalk possible, Mayor John Rhodes stated a goal of spending $20 million to extend the boardwalk to a length of . This would make the boardwalk longer than the one in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The city would ask companies and organizations to contribute the money. If the city approved the plan, the boardwalk would start two miles further south at Springmaid Pier, and it would end one mile farther north. Also, boardwalk designer Mike Wooten stated his interest in widening the boardwalk, which would require action by the South Carolina legislature. In 2013, a presentation was made to the city council. The Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Corporation voted on April 16, 2014 to plan for a municipal improvement district in which extra property taxes would be paid. If the city council voted for this idea, the revenue could be used for projects that would help downtown. Private sponsorships, however, were the preferred means of financing extensions. Buchanan Motels LLC planned a 23-story hotel at 17th Avenue North which would begin construction in 2015, and among their planned improvements for the area was a $500,000 extension of the boardwalk to 18th Avenue North. National Attention Even during the boardwalk's construction, the national media showed interest in the boardwalk. CBS' The Early Show, including meteorologist Dave Price, broadcast live on May 14, 2010, the weekend of the official opening. Team Sandtastic made a sand sculpture of Price. Also, Cake Boss Buddy Valastro from TLC helped produce a 10-foot 1200-pound cake in the shape of a flip-flop, made in Hoboken, New Jersey, and delivered to the May opening ceremony. The episode aired October 25, 2010. Travel and Leisure named Myrtle Beach Boardwalk the number two boardwalk mainly because of the entertainers, and The Today Show featured the report. On July 14, 2010, National Geographic ranked the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk behind the boardwalks at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Coney Island, and calling it \\"the town's hub of activity\\". Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce president Brad Dean estimated that publicity resulting from the boardwalk reached the equivalent of more than $1 million.  Festivals  *Boardwalk Fright Nights - A Halloween themed festival. *Carolina Country Music Festival - A country music festival, consisting of famous country music artists. *Sun Fun Festival - A festival to kick off the summer season, consists of music, entertainment, and food. Myrtle beach with a side view of the pier. Reception Visitors have given overwhelmingly positive reviews to the boardwalk. Despite some concerns about safety, and the lack of city money for a special boardwalk patrol, most people have felt very safe, and the police department reports few incidents. David Sebok, executive director of the Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Corporation, has received calls from most business owners who opposed the boardwalk, saying they are happy now. The number of area businesses increased even before summer's end, and those who already had businesses along the boardwalk reported higher income; some reported their best July ever. Additional development includes Myrtle Beach SkyWheel near Plyler Park, which at 187 feet was at the time of its construction the tallest Ferris wheel in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and similar in design to the Niagara SkyWheel, on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The Collins family planned to spend $7.5 million on the Second Avenue Pier area. On September 8, 2010, the Downtown Redevelopment Corporation met to look at the results of surveys of more than 900 people and found tourists and local people gave the boardwalk a 4.5 out of 5.

Incident On 17 May 2006, gunman Alparslan Arslan made his way into the Council of State building in Ankara and subsequently shot five judges. According to the deputy head of the Council of State, Arslan shouted \\"I am the soldier of God\\". One of the wounded judges, Mustafa Birden, had been criticized for ruling against teachers wearing Muslim head scarves. Judge Mustafa Y√ºcel √ñzbilgin suffered a gunshot wound to the head and after six hours of surgery was pronounced dead later that day in a hospital in Ankara.

Initially he said his son was not religious and must have been coerced. One month later he defended his son's actions in the name of upholding the nation's values. Ergenekon prosecutors revealed that after the assassination, Arslan's mother and father had received 32,000 euros and $30,000, respectively. An investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations on stolen weaponry in Iraq revealed that the gun was of the same type used in shooting priest Andrea Santoro (whose attacker had shouted the same words). In April 2010, T√úBƒ∞TAK said it was unable to retrieve security camera footage of the incident, with footage missing from the day of the incident and the day before.

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot Before the game starts, players have to name their character and choose between one and two player mode and the two pre-set difficulty levels (\\"slow\\" and \\"fast\\"). In the game, one player with a blue shirt plays tennis against an AI enemie portrayed by a non-player character (NPC) with a red shirt. In the two-player mode, one player competes against another player local. Players can move vertically and horizontally on the map. With the one button on the Atari 2600 controller, players make the serve. Every further shot is automatic if the ball has physical contact with the player. For every ball that falls on the opposing playing field, players get 15 points which they can see at the top part of the screen. After they reached 30 points, they only get 10 points for each other ball. After 40 points, they won one round. The number of rounds won goes up to 6. After winning 6 rounds, a new pile is opened at the top part of the screen which again goes up to 6. The first player who won two piles of 6 rounds wins the game.

It consists primarily of the evening Shema and Amidah. The service will often begin with two verses from Psalms, followed by the communal recitation of Barechu. The three paragraphs of the Shema are then said, both preceded and followed by two blessings, although sometimes a fifth blessing is added at the end. The hazzan (leader) then recites half-Kaddish. The Amidah is said quietly by everyone, and, unlike at the other services, is not repeated by the hazzan. He/she recites the full Kaddish, Aleinu is recited, and the mourners' Kaddish ends the service. Other prayers occasionally added include the Counting of the Omer (between Passover and Shavuot) and Psalm 27 (between the first of Elul and the end of Sukkot). Maariv is generally recited after sunset, however, it may be recited as early as one and a quarter seasonal hours before sunset. This is common only on Friday nights, in order to begin Shabbat earlier. At the conclusion of Shabbat and holidays, the service is usually delayed until nightfall. While Maariv should be prayed before midnight, it may be recited until daybreak or even sunrise. Etymology The word Maariv is the first significant word in the opening blessing of the evening service. It is derived from the Hebrew word erev, which translates to evening. Maariv is a conversion of this word into a verb, which means \\"bringing on night.\\" Arvit is the adjective form of this word, roughly translated as \\"of the evening\\". Origin Maariv is said to correspond to the evening observances in the Holy Temple. Although there were no sacrifices brought at night, any animal parts which were not burned during the day could be offered at night. Since this was not always necessary, the evening prayer was declared to be optional as well. However, the Jews long ago accepted it as an obligation, so it is now considered to be mandatory. However, there remain some vestiges of its original voluntary status; for example, the Amidah is not repeated by the leader, unlike by all other prayers. Another explanation is that as the third prayer, Maariv corresponds to Jacob, the third patriarch. Support is brought from , which says that when Jacob left his hometown of Beersheva to go to Haran, he \\"met at the place for the sun had set.\\" The Talmud understands this to mean that Jacob prayed at night, and hence instituted Maariv.Berakhot 26b Some suggest that he first started reciting the prayer after he fled from his homeland, and as a result, the prayer service has become associated with trust in God. Time Generally, the time when Maariv can first be recited is when the time for reciting Mincha ends. But there are varying opinions on this. Maariv should not begin before 1¬º hours before sunset. Others delay Maariv until after sunset or after dusk. This is so the Shema can be recited in its proper time. To satisfy this requirement, if Maariv is recited prior to this time, the Shema is repeated later in the evening. =Back-to-back Mincha and Maariv= In many congregations, the afternoon and evening prayers are recited back-to- back, to save people having to attend synagogue twice.In strict law, one should recite Mincha between sunset and nightfall only if one recites Arvit after nightfall. Conversely one should recite Arvit between sunset and nightfall only if one recites Mincha before sunset. In other words, one should not combine both prayers in the period between sunset and nightfall. The prevailing practice is to convene for Mincha shortly before sunset, so that Arvit may be prayed after sunset. On yet another view, the disputed period is not that between sunset and nightfall but between Plag Hamincha and sunset, that is, last one and one-quarter seasonal hours before sunset. The Vilna Gaon discouraged this practice, and followers of his set of customs commonly wait until after nightfall to recite Ma'ariv, since the name derives from the word \\"nightfall\\".One reason for this is that, while the prevailing practice may satisfy the law concerning the timing of Arvit in the sense of the evening Amidah, it means that the evening Shema is recited too early and must be repeated after nightfall. =On Shabbat= On the eve of Shabbat, some have the custom to recite the Maariv prayer earlier than usually, generally during Pelag Hamincha (1¬º hours before sunset). This is in order to fulfill the precept of adding from the weekday to the holiness of Shabbat. However, this is too early for the recitation of Shema, so Shema should be repeated later under these circumstances. Prayers included =Introductory prayers= On weekdays, the service begins with two verses from Psalms: and . =Shema= The first main part of the service is focused on the Shema Yisrael. In a congregation, Barechu, the formal public call to prayer, is recited. Then come two benedictions, one praising God for creating the cycle of day and night, and one thanking God for the Torah. The three passages of the Shema are then recited. Two more benedictions are recited. The first praises God for taking the Jews out of Egypt, and the second prays for protection during the night. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and followers of the Vilna Gaon) then add another blessing (Baruch Adonai L'Olam), which is made mostly from a tapestry of biblical verses. However, this is omitted on Shabbat and holidays, and by some at the conclusion of those days and on Chol HaMoed. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim in and out of Israel, albeit combined with the last blessing.Tikhlal) On Shabbat and holidays, some congregations recite relevant verses at this point. =Amidah= This is followed by the Shemoneh Esreh (Amidah). Half Kaddish is recited just before the Amidah, in order to separate between the required Shema and the (originally) optional Amidah. The Amidah is followed by the full Kaddish. Unlike in other prayers, the Amidah is not repeated aloud by the chazzan in Maariv. =Concluding prayers= Sephardim (and, in Israel, most who follow Nusach Sefard) then say Psalm 121 (or another topical Psalm), say the Mourner's Kaddish and repeat Barechu, before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with Aleinu followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barechu after mourner's Kaddish). From the beginning of Elul through Hoshanah Rabbah (and outside of Israel, on Shemini Atzeret as well), Nusach Ashkenaz recites Psalm 27, which contains many allusions to the Days of Awe and Sukkot. This is again followed by the mourner's Kaddish. Additions =Friday night= At the beginning of Shabbat on Friday night, the Amidah is immediately followed by the recitation of which discusses God's \\"resting\\" on the seventh day of creation. Although these verses were already said during the Amidah (and will be recited yet again during Kiddush at home) they are repeated. This is because when Shabbat coincides with a holiday, the Amidah does not include the passage. The three verses are followed by the Seven- Faceted Blessing. This is a single blessing designed to summarize the seven blessings of the Amidah, for those who came late.It is not clear whether this is meant to replace the latecomers' Amidah, or to give them additional time by prolonging the service. While originally this was said only by the leader, it is now customary for the congregation to recite the middle part before the leader does so. This blessing is omitted on the first night of Passover, because that is considered a \\"time of protection\\". = After Shabbat = During the Maariv service following Shabbat, several additions are made. A paragraph called \\"Ata Chonantanu\\" is inserted into the fourth blessing of the Amidah. The recitation of this paragraph officially ends Shabbat. One who forgets to recite this paragraph may also end Shabbat through Havdalah or by saying the words \\"Blessed is He Who differentiates between the holy and the secular.\\" Two sections of prayers, \\"Vihi Noam\\" (the last verse from Psalm 90, followed by the full Psalm 91) and V'Ata Kadosh (all but the first two verses of Uva Letzion), are added to the service. Nusach Ashkenaz also adds \\"Veyiten Lecha\\" (whereas Sfardim and Nusach Sefard say this at home after Havdala). These prayers are recited out of mercy for the wicked. The wicked are given a reprieve from Gehinnom during Shabbat, and the reprieve continues until all evening prayers following Shabbat are concluded. =Counting of the Omer= During the seven weeks from the second night of Passover until (but not including) Shavuot, the day is counted. This is usually done during Maariv, just before Aleinu. Others postpone the counting until the end of the service. If it is not yet nightfall, many congregations leave the counting to the individual. =Other additions= In general, relatively few prayers are added onto Maariv, even on holidays, although there are exceptions. On Simchat Torah, the Torah is read during Maariv. On Purim, the Book of Esther is read, followed by V'Ata Kadosh, and on Tish'a Ba'av the Book of Lamentations and some kinnot are recited, also followed by V'Ata Kadosh. On Yom Kippur, an extended order of Selichot is recited, followed by Avinu Malkeinu (except on the Sabbath). On both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, many congregations recite Psalm 24. All of these additions take place between the Full Kaddish and Aleinu.

The building contains a ventilation tower in the center of the building to regulate the temperature inside. When the building was transformed into a mosque, many aspects of a mosque was fitted in into the office building and as a result the building shows a unique example of how a mosque adapt a layout of an office. The building does not orient to the qibla (direction to Kaaba). As a result, the direction of the prayer hall is oriented around 45 degree relative to the building's orientation. As a result of this orientation, both the mihrab and the minbar of the mosque are located in the middle of the prayer hall, as opposed to the usual front of the prayer hall. The central flight of stairs were removed to make way for the prayer hall. To access the second floor, new sets of stairs were created on the front terrace.

Hanke was an early member of the 6th SS-Standarte and would become the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS in 1945. The 6th SS-Standarte was a regimental command of the Allgemeine-SS situated in the city of Berlin. As the command was located in the capital of Germany, the 6th Standarte was considered one of the more important SS units in Nazi Germany. The members of the Standarte themselves, however, were non-paid mustering troops of the \\"General-SS\\" as was the practice for most Allgemeine-SS regiments. The Standarte was first formed in October 1931 and was part of the so-called \\"Northern SS\\" under the control of Kurt Daluege. At the time, there was a divisional disunity in the SS, with SS units in southern Germany controlled by Heinrich Himmler and the northern units answering to Daluege. It was not until 1934, after most of the SS headquarters offices had relocated to Berlin, that this division was eventually done away with. During Reichstag elections of 1931, the 6th SS Standarte played a significant role in campaigning for the Nazi Party and repeated the effort again when Adolf Hitler ran for the office of President of Germany in 1932. One early member of the Standarte, who would later become the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was Karl Hanke. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the 6th SS-Standarte adopted the honor title of \\"Charlottenburg\\" and often participated in several major Nazi Party rallies held in the German capitol. A year later, during the Night of the Long Knives, the Standarte played a major role in rounding up the Sturmabteilung leadership in Berlin, although most SA executions were carried out by SD troops and Gestapo agents. One of the most notorious actions that the 6th SS-Standarte engaged in was \\"Kristallnacht\\" where Berlin SS men sought out and destroyed numerous Jewish synagogues and businesses. Shortly afterwards, the Standarte was granted a second honor title as \\"6 SS-Standarte Eduard Felsen\\". When World War II began in 1939, the Berlin SS regiment slowly began losing its members to regular military service, since mustering Allgemeine-SS personnel were not exempt from conscription. The Standarte was still participating in ceremonial functions as late as 1944, however, and in the last year of the war many of the remaining members became involved with the Volksturm and participated in the Battle of Berlin.

History Drive is the follow-up to his 2005 release, Livin' on the Run. His first release was the 1989 A&M; album Scott Grimes. This album features songs written during many personal changes for the writing team of Scott Grimes & Dave Harris. Both men, having gone through divorces in 2006, used that experience as the backbone of this release. Songs like \\"Back Into You\\", \\"Waiting\\" and \\"What Love Is\\" reflect a somber tone, while others like \\"Hide\\", \\"Corner Pub\\" and \\"Soon I Will Be Found\\" are tongue-in-cheek and fun to listen to. One of the album's highlights is the last track, \\"(I Don‚Äôt Wanna) Let You Go\\" which Grimes & Harris co-wrote with Julian Lennon and John Spinks of The Outfield. Music and lyrics Drive, musically and lyrically is a slight departure from Grimes' previous album Livin' on the Run which was more rock-oriented. Drive is a quieter and soft rock-oriented album with more personal lyrics by Grimes and Harris, who both went through divorces during the writing of this album.

History of CARTA Before CARTA became an established and formal UCSD recognized Organized Research Unit, a multidisciplinary effort to study human origins had already been underway in the La Jolla area for over a decade, coordinated by the UCSD Project for Explaining the Origin of Humans (POH). The group involved local experts in San Diego as well as many others throughout the world. The primary activity of the group was to organize multi-disciplinary interactions amongst members (via meetings in La Jolla), and via secure internet-based mechanisms.

Together with the Queen's Gurkha Engineers, the Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment and the Royal Gurkha Rifles they form part of the Brigade of Gurkhas. QGS was formed during The Malayan Emergency to support the 17th Gurkha Division. History The history of Queen's Gurkha Signals dates back to 1911 when Gurkha Signallers were employed in the three Indian Corps of Sappers and Miners (Bombay, Bengal, and Madras). It was not until the First World War the whole companies of Gurkha signallers existed within these three Corps. Eventually at the end of 1928 these corps were phased out of service due to an insufficient work force. The second Gurkha Signals unit was created during The Malayan Emergency. The unit was raised to support the Gurkha Infantry involved in battle against communist-sponsored guerilla organization Malayan Races Liberation Army. This unit was fully composed of Gurkhas unlike the previous incarnation. On 18 December 1959, the newly formed unit was christened 48th Gurkha Brigade Signal Squadron with its commander Major L H Gregory MBE. Titles of the regiment and its predecessor As a part of Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations 1977, the Regiment regained its Royal title, along with the Gurkha Engineers, becoming Queen's Gurkha Signals.

Once on the ground they would attempt to disrupt the road and rail networks between Metz and Nancy and the approach to the Rhine plain. One team, because of weather conditions over the drop zone, returned to England, another team landed in the middle of a German unit and the other two teams achieved some success before returning to Allied lines in early October. Plan The 51 men from 'A' Squadron 2nd Special Air Service (SAS) were to leave RAF Keevil, Wiltshire by Shorts Stirling aircraft on the 15 September. They were divided into four groups, to be parachuted onto four different drop zones. Once on the ground the plan called for each of the groups to be divided into two smaller groups to cover a larger area. The 'A1' group were given the area south west of Saint-Avold to work in and the 'A2' group the B√©nestroff area. The 'B1' group would be west of Ingwiller and the 'B2' group the Sarreguemines area. The 'C1' group were given the area around the Saverne gap to work in and the 'C2' group the area south west of Sarrebourg. The 'D1' group the roads between G√©rardmer and Colmar and the 'D2' group the roads between Bussang and Thann. Mission The 2nd Special Air Service groups all left from RAF Keevil on the 15 September 1944. The SAS were divided into four groups 'A'-'D', to be parachuted onto four different drop zones. =A group= 'A' group landed from their proposed drop zone, on top of a German position. Because of this and attempts to evade capture the group was divided into three. 'A1' now consisted of Lieutenant Darwall and three men. Sergeant Williams the commander of the original 'A2' group had two men. A third group of men who were the last to leave the aircraft had unfortunately lost all their equipment hiding from the German search parties. Both radios carried by Group A were damaged on landing leaving them out of contact with their headquarters and the resupply planes that were later sent out. The 'A2' group on the 18 September destroyed some telegraph poles and on the 19 September were forced to take cover after hearing small arms fire nearby. Over the night of the 21/21 September they destroyed an electricity high tension pylon and then found an observation point overlooking their target railway line. They planted explosives on the rail line on the 23 September which they heard successfully going off, but having left the area were unaware of what damage had been caused. They later found out it had been a cattle train en route to Germany and it took two days for the line to be repaired. Then it was patrolled by two German sentries every . Heading south and west they came upon their next two targets. On the 26 they observed their target rail line but discovered it was unused and headed for the next target, another rail line. Reaching this line on the 27 September they discovered that this line was also unused. On the 28 September they took shelter at a farm, the farmer and his three sons (deserters from the German Army) informed them about the train they had destroyed. They also discovered the area was defended by a panzer division and that about 1,000 troops and a General were stationed in the nearby village of Vergaville. On 30 September Sergeant Williams group left the farm and headed west, they planted tyre burster's on a road which were set off by a passing tanks instead. On 2 October they found some boot tracks which they identified being made by SAS boots. They followed the tracks hoping they belonged to their missing men. The tracks led them to a farm where they stopped for a meal and discovered that the tracks had been left by Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant (SQMS) Alcock and his 'C2' group who had been there two days previously. The 'A2' three man group eventually passed over into the American lines on the 3 October. The 'A3' group was formed from the last four men to leave the plane all Privates. They luckily managed to evade capture and headed for a nearby wood, one of the men had landed badly and injured his leg so the group remained in the wood overnight to allow him to recover. On the afternoon of the 16 September they heard the Germans searching the woods. Leaving their rucksacks behind they made it to the edge of the wood and hid in a water filled overgrown drainage ditch, which ran alongside the adjacent fields. They hid in the ditch for six hours while the search went on around them, several times Germans crossed their ditch without seeing them. They stayed until they believed the Germans had left the area coming out at dusk. They were forced to leave their equipment behind as one of the men had overheard the Germans saying that they had found them and set up ambush for when they (the 'A3' group) returned to collect them. The group then set off towards the American lines having lost their explosives and were thus unable to carry out any attacks on the rail lines they had been assigned. They crossed over into the American lines on the 20 September. =B group= The 'B' group landed from their drop zone. Not much is known about their activities. The 'B1' group commander Lieutenant Birnie was captured on the 17 September and died in a prisoner of war camp after an air raid by the Allies. Also part of the 'B1' group were Corporal Gilbert Voisin who was captured on the 1 October near Phalsbourg, and Private Gerhard Wertheim, who was captured in September 1944. Wertheim was executed by the Germans between Niederbuhl and Rotenfels in Germany, the date of his execution is not known. The 'B2' group was commanded by Lieutenant Castellain who died of his wounds on the 12 October, shortly after having made contact with the Operation Loyton SAS mission. Private Ashe was captured on the 23 September and executed at Gaggenau in Germany. =C group= 'C' group were the furthest from their proposed drop zone, landing away and because of communication problems their equipment panniers were not dropped. The 'C1' group radio had also been damaged during the parachute landing. The group was dispersed on landing only two men from the 'C2' group had gathered on the drop zone. The commander of the 'C1' group Captain Scott had badly sprained his ankle on landing and was finding it difficult to move about. Lying up overnight three more members of the 'C2' were found. The group laid up for another day sending out reconnaissance parties to try and pinpoint their exact location. On the 19 September Captain Scott divided his enlarged group into two one of four men and the other of five men. The four man group under the command of Corporal Hill moved off towards the south. On the 20 September they observed a rail line but it appeared to be rusty and unused. The same happened on the 21 September at a different rail line. On the 22 September they saw a 20 vehicle road convoy passing, but were not able to intervene. That evening they took shelter in an abandoned farm, by now the effects of the lost equipment panniers were taking their toll and the men were feeling weak from the loss of their food. Leaving the farm on the 25 September they set off for their last objective some gun positions near the front line. By the 28 September they were forced into hiding by the German patrol activity in the area. Moving into a disused farm they stayed in the area, cutting telephone wires and carrying out a reconnaissance of the gun positions. They finally made contact with the American lines just before 23:00 hours 3 October. SQMS Alcock and his group three other men kept observations on a rail line all day of the 19 September mo trains were seen but they decided to lay an explosive charge anyway. The charge was laid at 21;00 hours and was detonated by a passing train at 23:00 hours. Leaving the area south south west they came across evidence of defensive trenches being dug. On the 24 September they observed a tank battle and 20 tanks withdrawing into a wood beside Blanche-√âglise. One member of the group Corporal Holden now came down with malaria so they decided to hole up a farm. Leaving the farm on the 26 September they headed west and come across another farm, while inside talking to the occupants a German patrol appeared. Eventually the SAS group managed to get out the rear of the farm and opened fire on the Germans who followed them out. They then made their way through the woods locating a number of tank workshops, harbour positions and a brigade headquarters. They returned to a farm they had stayed at earlier and discovered the A3 group had been there. Remaining at the farm until the 1 October they set out for the American lines cutting telephone lines on the way. They crossed over into the 4th Armored Division lines. =D group= 'D' group were unable to parachute on the night, being unable to identify their drop zone in the foggy conditions. They made a further five attempts on the following nights but all were unsuccessful.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 2010. The community covers an area of about ; its rough boundaries are N. Glenwood Ave to the west, Winona Street to the north, Sheridan Road to the east, and Ainslie Street to the south. It was home to the Essenay Studios in the 1920s founded by Charlie Chaplain, a producer of silent movies before relocating to Southern California in Hollywood. Essenay Studios now is home to St. Augustine College. History The area covered by the historic district originally developed in the 1880s as a suburb called Argyle Park. The suburb had been named by Chicago Alderman and developer James A. Campbell for his ancestors the Dukes of Argyll in Scotland. Development was centered on a station on the new Chicago & Evanston line of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway that opened in May 1885. The village, along with the rest of the Lake View Township, was annexed into Chicago in 1889. In 1908 the Northwestern Elevated Railroad was extended north from Wilson Avenue, using the tracks of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, This linked the suburb into Chicago's 'L' network, and the area became popular with people of limited means who wanted to live on the Lake Michigan shore. The railroad tracks were elevated onto an embankment between 1914 and 1922. Vietnamese and Thai restaurants at the corner of Argyle Street and Broadway Chicago restaurateur Jimmy Wong bought property in the area in the 1960s and planned its rebirth as New Chinatown. He envisioned a mall with pagodas, trees and reflecting ponds to replace the empty storefronts. The Hip Sing Association, a Chinese cultural group, moved its Chicago offices to Argyle Street in 1971, and by 1974 Wong and the Hip Sing Association owned 80% of the three-block stretch on Argyle. Wong had an accident and broke both hips, leaving him unable to follow through on his plans. In 1979 Charlie Soo, founder of the Asian American Small Business Association, took up the cause, and the area developed not solely as a Chinese enclave but also including Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, and Japanese businesses. Soo campaigned to get the Chicago Transit Authority to give the Argyle 'L' station a $250,000 face-lift, then in 1981 he started the \\"Taste of Argyle,\\" an annual food festival. He also secured funds from Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne to fix the sidewalks, and later from Mayor Harold Washington to repair building facades. Because of his tireless work in promoting the neighborhood, Soo would later be known as the unofficial \\"Mayor of Argyle Street.\\" By 1986 it was estimated that Uptown had about 8000 Chinese and Vietnamese residents.

A gamma-ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, and often followed by a longer-lived \\"afterglow\\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio). At a total duration of only 3 seconds, GRB 070714B was classified as a short burst, a subclass of GRBs which is believed to be caused by the merger of two neutron stars. GRB 070714B had a redshift of z = 0.92, corresponding to a distance of about 7.4 billion light years, making it the most distant short burst detected as of 2007.  Observations  GRB 070714B was detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite on 14 July 2007 at 04:59 UTC. The burst lasted only 3 seconds and reached its peak intensity 0.2 seconds after the initial detection. The optical afterglow was detected by the Liverpool Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope.  Distance record  Spectroscopy of the optical afterglow and the burst's host galaxy revealed a single emission line of oxygen at a redshift of z = 0.92. This corresponds to a distance of 7.4 billion light years, making it the oldest and most distant short burst ever detected. The previous record holder had been GRB 051221A at a redshift of z = 0.546. At a redshift of z = 0.92, the total energy released by GRB 070714B (assuming isotropic emission) was approximately 1.2 ergs, which is several orders of magnitude higher than short-duration bursts with a redshift less than z = 0.5, but still significantly smaller than typical long- duration bursts.

First formed in 1932, the Standarte was headquartered in Vienna and during its first years of existence served as a base for members of the Austrian SS who were attempting to influence Austrian politics towards an Anschluss with Germany. By 1936, the SS had been declared illegal in Austria, and the 11th SS-Standarte went completely underground, although still participated in several covert actions against the government of Austria. When Nazi Germany absorbed Austria in 1938, the Standarte \\"came out in the open\\" and became the largest regiment command of the SS in Austria, under the authority of the SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. During this period in the 1930s, one notable member of the 11th SS-Standarate was Amon G√∂th who would later join the German Concentration Camp service and be immortalized in the film Schindler's List. When World War II began, most members of the 11th SS-Standarte transferred into the Waffen-SS. A small core of Allgemeine-SS personnel remained in Austria, but as the war progressed there were less and less formal functions performed by the 11th SS-Standarte. The unit effectively existed on paper only after 1944, but was listed as having a posted commander until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945.

The showrunner for the season was Al Jean, with three episodes ran with Matt Selman, one of those he also wrote himself. The show's 500th episode, \\"At Long Last Leave\\", aired February 19, 2012. Episodes Production The season premiere episode \\"The Falcon and the D'ohman\\" features a reference to the previous episode of the series, the twenty-second season finale \\"The Ned-Liest Catch\\" that aired May 22, 2011. In that episode, the characters Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel started dating. The episode ends with Homer and Marge Simpson giving the viewers a link to the official The Simpsons website, TheSimpsons.com, and encouraging them to go on the website and vote over the summer of 2011 on whether Ned and Edna should stay together. Executive producer Al Jean said in an interview that the writers decided it would not be interesting for them to do another episode where a relationship ended, and they thought it would be interesting \\"to see what people think, the Internet certainly has a lot of opinion on the show, might as well have them have their say\\". When asked why the writers thought Ned and Edna were the right characters for a cliffhanger like this, Jean said that \\"In life, unusual things happen. People couple together in ways you would not expect, and he's single and she's single. We thought it would be funny, the fact that they both have these connections to the Simpsons but they never really met or if they have met it was minimal.\\" The result of the poll were revealed in \\"The Falcon and the D'ohman\\". According to Jean, the poll was \\"very strong in one direction\\". He assured in an interview before the result was presented that the poll was authentic and the writers would not undo the viewers' decision, and added that \\"What our fans have joined together, let no writer tear asunder.\\" =Cancellation threat= 20th Century Fox Television released a statement on October 4, 2011, saying that \\"23 seasons in, The Simpsons is as creatively vibrant as ever and beloved by millions around the world. We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model. We are hopeful that we can reach an agreement with the voice cast that allows The Simpsons to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come.\\" One of the problems was that The Simpsons was possibly worth more cancelled than on the air. A 17-year-old syndication deal with local TV stations prohibits Fox from selling the show to cable networks. As long as The Simpsons still produces new episodes, Fox cannot break this deal. In the meantime, cable networks have grown to become just as big a market as the local TV stations. Another consideration was that Fox's parent company News Corporation was having meetings discussing the possibility of a cable channel that would only air The Simpsons episodes. Analysts consider a cancellation and subsequent second-run deal that includes cable networks to be worth $750 million. On this issue, Al Jean commented in an interview with TV Guide that \\"It's a big company, and there are definitely people whose interests would have been better served by ending it. Those interests were superseded because we're still valuable to the network in terms of our ratings.\\" For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors were willing to take a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point, Harry Shearer even offered a 70% pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, renewing the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included the animators, writers, post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saved money, as the animation of the show became more efficient. Ratings The season premiere episode \\"The Falcon and the D'ohman\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 25, 2011. It was watched by approximately 8.08 million people during this broadcast. It received a 3.9 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18‚Äì49, and a ten percent share. The ratings were up three percent compared to the last season's premiere. The Simpsons became the second highest-rated program in the 18‚Äì49 demographic in Fox's Animation Domination lineup that night, finishing before The Cleveland Show and American Dad! but after Family Guy. The Simpsons was, however, the most-watched show in the lineup in terms of total viewers. During the twenty-third season, the cost of a 30-second advertising spot would be $254,260 in an original broadcast. It is the fifth-most expensive show for advertisers on Fox, with only American Idol, The X Factor, Glee and Family Guy being more expensive.

A critic for The Athenaeum, writing in 1870, the year the Contes were published, remarked that Belgian writers of the day suffered from a lack of domestic interest, as Francophone readers preferred literature from France: \\"what keeps down authors is the coldness of the public, and the silence or hostility of criticism. This is also the reason why authors often go on to the end of their lives without curing themselves of certain faults which no one has been at the pains to draw their attention to.\\" He adduces Bovie as an example, noting the \\"strong powers\\" evidenced by her writing, as well as a \\"warm sensibility\\" that in the story \\"Rapha√´l\\", about the incestuous desire between a young painter and his mother, became excessive. As a whole, however, the collection was judged to be marred by \\"sad inequalities, failures and exaggerations.\\"The Athenaeum (1870), p. 872 online.

It is part of Oxford's Humanities Division. European languages (other than Latin and Ancient Greek, taught as part of classics) were first taught at Oxford in the 19th century. The first chair in the faculty was established in 1877, the newest in 1972. A range of languages are studied at undergraduate and postgraduate level.  Historical overview  Modern languages, as opposed to ancient ones, were not taught in Oxford for much of the university's history. In 1724, a donation by George I was intended to provide teaching in French and German to train future diplomats, but the scheme soon failed.Firth, Sir Charles, Modern Languages at Oxford 1724‚Äì1929, Oxford University Press, 1929. Another endowment, by Sir Robert Taylor (1714‚Äì1788), was contested by his son so that the university only received the sum (of ¬£65,000) in 1835. The money was invested, and it was only in 1844 that the Hebdomadal Board proposed that Modern Languages should be taught within the university. By then the construction of two contiguous, grandly harmonious buildings was almost complete. The first, the Randolph or 'University' Galleries, was to house galleries for statues and paintings, and is now called the Ashmolean Museum. The matching second building was designed to house lecture rooms and libraries for the study of European languages, and is now the Taylor Institution. The Faculty's administrative offices are situated in Wellington Square. Initially there were only two Taylorian Teachers, one in French and one in German. In 1847, Jules Bu√© was appointed to teach French; he also produced the first French translation of Alice in Wonderland. In 1848, F.H. Trithen was appointed as the first Professor of Modern European Languages. He was followed by the Germanist and Orientalist Friedrich Max M√ºller (1854‚Äì68), who went on to become Professor of Comparative Philology.Baird, Liz, A Small Exhibition to Commemorate 100 years of French at Oxford 1905‚Äì2005 (Leaflet), Taylor Institution, 2005. A statute for the Founding of the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages was approved by Congregation in 1903. The University of Oxford also has the only established Chair of the Romance Languages in Britain, which dates back to 1909, though since 2008 this chair has been shared with the new Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics. The Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages now offers various languages for study at (post-A-level) undergraduate level, including French, German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Modern Greek, Czech, Polish and Celtic. Many of these, especially the less commonly taught languages, can be taken up at beginner's level, otherwise known as ab initio.  French  Oxford's French sub-faculty is the largest French studies department outside France, with over thirty permanent members of staff covering all areas of French literature and language. The quality and range of the department's research was recognised in two Research Assessment Exercises (RAEs). In 2001 the department received the top grade of 5*. In the 2008 RAE, it performed better than any other French department in the UK. The French department was said by The Times in May 2010 to be the best university French department for teaching in the United Kingdom. The Chair of the Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature (held in conjunction with a Fellowship at All Souls College) was established in 1918 after a donation of ¬£25,000 by Sir Basil Zaharoff. The same 'Zaharoff fund' also provides for the annual Zaharoff Lecture, for which the Sub-Faculty of French invites an eminent figure from French literary studies. The Sub-Faculty of French has ongoing links with other Oxford-based institutions, notably the Maison Fran√ßaise d‚ÄôOxford (MFO) and the Voltaire Foundation. The journal French Studies was founded in 1947 in Oxford and has its editorial office near the Faculty's central offices in Wellington Square. Some notable past members of the Sub-Faculty of French include: * Malcolm Bowie, Marshal Foch Professor 1992‚Äì2002, Proust scholar * Ann Jefferson, Professor of French 2006‚Äì2015 * Jean Seznec, Marshal Foch Professor 1950‚Äì1972, author of La Survivance des dieux antiques (1940) * Enid Starkie (Somerville 1934‚Äì1965), known for her work on French poets * Jean-Yves Tadi√©, Marshal Foch Professor 1988‚Äì1991, Proust scholar  German  The Oxford German department is one of the oldest, largest and most active departments in England. There are more than a dozen full-time staff members. The German department admits about 70 students a year. Students are taught in small groups or one-to-one throughout their course. The course combines a grounding in the four key language skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing with an extensive choice of options ranging from medieval studies and linguistics to contemporary German literature and society. There are two chairs associated with German studies. The Taylor Chair of the German Language and Literature was first held by Max M√ºller, the previous incumbent was Terence James Reed and the post holder since 2010 is Ritchie Robertson.\\"Ritchie Robertson\\".

The Chair of the Serena Professor of Italian (held in conjunction with a Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford) was established in 1918 thanks to a donation of ¬£10,000 by Arthur Serena. In 1990 the chair was renamed the Fiat-Serena Chair of Italian Studies and in 2009 the name was further modified to become the Agnelli-Serena Chair of Italian Studies, in order to reflect the generous benefaction given by Gianni Agnelli, Head of Fiat, at the end of the 1980s.

Spanish  The Sub-faculty of Spanish at Oxford, which celebrated its centenary in 2005, is one of the largest departments of Spanish and Spanish- American studies in the UK, with 14 full-time permanent staff as well as part- time and temporary lecturers and native speakers. It offers courses in all areas of Spanish and Spanish American literatures and language, as well as options in the Catalan and Galician languages and literatures. It has maintained its position as one of the top departments of Spanish in the UK, with 60% of its research output being classed as internationally excellent or world-leading in the 2008 RAE. The King Alfonso XIII Chair of Spanish Studies, held in conjunction with a Fellowship at Exeter College, was endowed in 1927 by a donation from Lord Nuffield and others. The Queen Sof√≠a Research Fellowship in Modern Spanish Literature was founded in 1988 and is also associated with Exeter College, of which H.M. the Queen of Spain is an Honorary Fellow. The Sub-Faculty regularly hosts lectures by prominent writers and academics in the Spanish-speaking world. A number of Spanish writers have been teachers in the Sub-faculty; these include Jorge Guill√©n from 1929 to 31, D√°maso Alonso from 1931 to 1933, Jos√© Angel Valente from 1955 to 1958, Vicente Molina Foix from 1976 to 1979, F√©lix de Az√∫a from 1979 to 1981 and Javier Mar√≠as from 1983 to 1985. The novel Todas las almas (1989; trans. All Souls, 1992) by Javier Mar√≠as is set in Oxford and alludes to several members of the Sub-faculty during his time there. Some notable past members of the Spanish Sub-faculty include: *Salvador de Madariaga, King Alfonso XIII Professor (1928‚Äì31), scholar, novelist historian and statesman. Variously ambassador to Washington and Paris, delegate to the League of Nations, and Minister of Education during the Spanish Republic. Early advocate of European integration and founder of the College of Europe at Bruges. *Sir Peter Edward Russell, King Alfonso XIII Professor (1953‚Äì82), expert in medieval and early-modern literature. Distinguished record in the intelligence services during World War II. The model for 'Sir Peter Wheeler', a major character in four novels by Javier Mar√≠as.  Celtic  The Jesus Professorship of Celtic was the first chair to be established in the Faculty, in 1877 with John Rhys as the first professor. It is the only chair in Celtic at an English university. In 2020, with the appointment of David Willis, the Chair was transferred to the Faculty of Linguistics.  Studying languages at Oxford  Most students at Oxford study two languages, though some languages can also be studied as a sole- degree course, or as a part of a joint degree alongside a Middle-Eastern language, History, English, Classics, Philosophy or Linguistics. While most teaching takes place in the different colleges of the university, lectures are generally held in the Taylor Institution or Taylorian, where the modern languages library is situated. The four-year B.A. degree includes a compulsory year abroad, spent either enrolled at a university or with paid or volunteer work in a foreign country where the target language is spoken.

He obtained various degrees from the University of Oxford as a member of Merton College ‚Äì Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1515, Master of Arts (MA) in 1520, Bachelor of Theology in 1528, and Doctor of Theology in 1532. In between these achievements, he served as Registrar of the university from 1524 to 1520 and was ordained as a priest in 1526. He later served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford (from 1532 to 1547, then again in 1550, 1556 and 1558), and also held offices at Merton College. He was appointed as a canon of Cardinal College, holding this position when it was refounded as King Henry VIII College and then Christ Church, Oxford). His parish posts included St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, and Bampton, Oxfordshire, and Bugbrooke and Towcester (both in Northamptonshire), with additional appointments as Chancellor of Chichester Cathedral and as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral. He was a \\"theological conservative\\" during the turbulent religious changes during his lifetime, and was regarded as \\"forthright, active, and intelligent.\\" By 1551, his views of the religious line taken by Edward VI led to his imprisonment in the Fleet Prison, but he was released when Mary I came to the throne in 1553, with whose opinions he was more in sympathy. He refused, however, to swear the required oath of supremacy when Elizabeth I came to power, although he had offered her congratulations upon her succession on behalf of Oxford (along with the Warden of Merton, Thomas Raynolds). As a result, he was removed from all his positions, save only the rectory of Towcester, and held at Lambeth Palace until he promised not to interfere with religious matters.

It revolves around Tinker Bell, a fairy character created by J. M. Barrie in his 1904 play, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, and featured in subsequent adaptations, especially in Disney's animated works, and how she ventures to the Winter Woods and meets her twin sister, Periwinkle, who is a frost fairy. The film was directed by Peggy Holmes and co-directed by Bobs Gannaway. Starring the voices of Mae Whitman, Lucy Liu, Megan Hilty, Raven-Symon√© and Angela Bartys, it also features new cast members who include Matt Lanter, Timothy Dalton, Lucy Hale and Debby Ryan, while Anjelica Huston narrates. Plot As the fairies make preparations for the oncoming winter, Tinker Bell helps her friend Fawn take the animals to the Winter Woods to get them ready for hibernation. Fawn warns Tink that fairies from the warmer seasons are forbidden from crossing the border to the woods as the cold can damage their wings, a law supposedly instated by Lord Milori. Out of curiosity, Tink ignores Fawn‚Äôs warnings, crosses over, and her wings start to sparkle. Before she can investigate further, Fawn pulls her back. Tink researches on sparkling wings but finds the page incomplete. Another fairy tells her the book‚Äôs author, the Keeper, lives in the Winter Woods. Tucking her wings in a coat, Tinker Bell hides in a shipment of snowflake baskets. She gets picked up by a novice owl who crash lands in the Winter Woods, and the book falls out of her bag. The book is found by Lord Milori, who has it delivered to the Keeper. Tink secretly follows to the library and spots the Keeper, Dewey. Another winter fairy rushes into the room, and Tink notices her wings sparkling like her own. Tink and the other fairy, Periwinkle, notice each other and it is revealed that they were born from the same laugh, making them sisters. The two spend the day together, with Peri showing Tinker Bell around the Winter Woods and introducing her to her friends, bubbly Gliss and sarcastic Spike. At Peri‚Äôs home, Tink builds a fire which eventually causes the floor to melt and crumble beneath them. Having her wings tucked inside her coat, Tink is unable to fly and nearly falls but is saved by Dewey. He advises that it is too dangerous for them to be together and the sisters pretend to say goodbye at the border but promise to meet again. The next day, Tinker Bell arrives at the border with an ice-powered snow maker. With the machine keeping her cool, Peri crosses over and Tink introduces her to her friends and shows her the warm side of Pixie Hollow. After a while, the machine starts running out of ice and Peri‚Äôs wings begin to wilt. Tink and her friends rush her to the border where they meet Lord Milori, who takes Peri back to the woods. Queen Clarion arrives and explains that she was the one who instated the law. Tinker Bell and Periwinkle tearfully say goodbye to each other forever. Lord Milori knocks the snow-maker into the stream under the bridge, where it gets caught by some rocks. Tinker Bell and Periwinkle are told, by Queen Clarion and Lord Milori respectively, the story of two fairies who fell in love, one from the warm seasons, the other from the Winter Woods. As their romance grew, one of them crossed the border, resulting in them breaking a wing; a damage that there was no known cure for. After this, Queen Clarion declared the separation of the warm fairies from the winter fairies in order to prevent any incidents like the one from the story happening again. Receiving news of an emergency, Tinker Bell and the Queen fly back to the border where they find that the snow-maker has been collecting ice from the stream, generating snow continuously and causing a massive blizzard. Tink and her friends manage to free the snow- maker, but a freeze that will engulf Pixie Hollow begins to spread, and will eventually reach the pixie dust tree. Trying to think of what to do, Tink notices that a Periwinkle flower that Peri had covered in frost is still alive and flies to the Winter Woods. As she approaches Peri and her friends, Tink‚Äôs wings freeze and she crash lands. Peri‚Äôs friends explain that frost keeps the warm air inside like a blanket and they return to the pixie dust tree to cover it in frost. Though it seems like an impossible task for only three fairies, they are soon joined by Lord Milori who brings reinforcements, and all the winter fairies work to frost as much of the warm seasons as possible. As the freeze approaches, Lord Milori warns the warm fairies to take cover, including the Queen whom he gives his cape, revealing one of his wings is broken. After some time, the freeze finally subsides. The Pixie Dust Tree is safe, and all the fairies celebrate. However, Tink reveals that she broke a wing when she flew to the woods earlier. As the sisters say goodbye, Tink and Peri‚Äôs wings touch and, in a flash, Tinker Bell‚Äôs wing heals. Queen Clarion and Lord Milori share a kiss, revealing themselves as the two lovers from the story. Sometime later, the warm fairies are now able to cross over into the border by having their wings frosted and the two sisters never have to be apart again.

Each upright was braced by a pair of diagonal tubes, at about 45¬∞, to the rear.Beach Scaffolding Defence; Trial - WO 199/1618. The Catalogue, The National Archives wide sections were preassembled and then carried to the sea to be placed in position at the half tide mark as an obstacle to boats. However, trials found that a 250-ton barge at or an 80-ton trawler at would pass through the obstacle as if it were not there and a trawler easily pulled out one bay with an attached wire rope. Tests in October 1940, confirmed that tanks could only break through with difficulty, as a result Z.1 was adopted as an anti-tank barrier for beaches thought suitable for landing tanks. As an anti-tank barrier it was placed at or just above the high water point where it would be difficult for tanks to get enough momentum to break through the barrier. In some places, two sets of scaffolding were set up, one in the water against boats and one at high water against tanks. The problem of securing the barriers on sand was overcome by the development of the sword picket by Stewarts & Lloyds - this device was later known at the Admiralty as the Wallace Sword. Barriers varying in length from a couple of hundred feet to three miles were constructed consuming 50% of Britain's production of scaffolding steel at an estimated cost of ¬£6,600 per mile (equivalent to ¬£ today). Despite this, many miles of Admiralty scaffolding were erected using more than of scaffolding tube. After the war, the scaffolding got in the way of swimmers. Very soon, the scaffolding was removed for scrap and any remaining traces are now very rare, but are occasionally revealed by storms.

While enslaved, Ben Ali wrote the Bilali Document and served as the religious leader and Imam for eighty slavered Muslim men that lived on his plantation. After slavery abolition (1865) and until 1990, few Guineans emigrated to the United States and, these were mostly scholars and professionals. On the late 1980s, Guineans began to immigrate to the U.S. as a way to escape poverty and the harsh military regime in their country - Guinea. So, they settled initially in New York City, Boston and Atlanta, forming important communities. Over time, Guineans were migrating to other parts of the U.S., such as Chicago (whose Guineans came also from New York).
