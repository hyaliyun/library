It can trace its history back to the establishment of the office of Colonial Secretary and Registrar of the Records of New South Wales in 1821.Colonial Secretary Agency Details, State Records New South Wales. Accessed 12 January 2008. However, in the early years of the Colony's history, little attention was paid to the management and preservation of non-current public records. This was mainly because the government of the day was fully focussed on the administration of the convict system, law and order, immigration and land settlement. Documents which were not required for the day-to-day running of the government were usually neglected or were destroyed. Background It was not until the late nineteenth century, with the approach of the Centenary of the Colony, that an awareness of the value of public archives as fundamental sources for Australian history was recorded. This interest led to the appointment of an Archivist of New South Wales, and the publication of Historical Records of New South Wales.Russell Doust, The Administration of Official Archives in New South Wales 1870 ‚Äì 1980, M Lib thesis 1969 At the time the term 'archives' was used broadly to include manuscripts, pictorial material and maps from a wide range of private sources as well as to denote non-current official records.'The Archives Authority of New South Wales ‚Äì The First twenty Five Years' in Archeion ‚Äì The Newsletter of the State Archives, No. 5, June 1987, p.7 The Trustees of the Public Library of New South Wales were active from about 1870 in the preservation of books and manuscripts relating to Australia, but it was the opening of the Mitchell Library in 1910 that provided the first real stimulus to action in the area of public records. At the request of the acting Premier and the Attorney General, The Trustees of the Public Library prepared a report on the present and future dangers of the neglect of State records, which included recommendations on the establishment of an Archives Department in the Public Library Building. Locomotive drivers from the Eveleigh workshop during the 1917 strike. This was a great period of change for New South Wales. This proposal lapsed but during the period 1911‚Äì1918, some action was taken towards establishing an archives office. A number of instructions were issued by both the Premier and the Public Service Board, advising departments to transfer non-current records considered to be of historical value, to the Mitchell Library. On the authority of these instructions, the Trustees of the Public Library became in effect, the archival authority for the State, and much work was done in the Mitchell Library to collect and preserve NSW State archives. In November 1953 an Archives Department was established within the Public Library of New South Wales (subsequently State Library of New South Wales) by which time there was an estimated 2,300 metres of archives in the custody of the Mitchell Library. The Archives Department in the period following 1953 adapted and put into practice recognised archival principles and procedures, both in the management of State archives in the custody of the Trustees and in the management of the Government Records Repository, which was established in 1955. The management of the repository was overseen by the Public Service Board. The foundations for establishing a statutory authority to administer official archives in New South Wales had been well laid by the mid 1950s and preparatory work on Archives legislation began in 1955. Archives Act 1960 In September 1960, the Archives Bill was approved by Cabinet. It was introduced into the Legislative Assembly in October and in November the Archives Act, No 46 of 1960, received Royal Assent. The Act was proclaimed to commence of the first day of June 1961.Archives Management, State Records New South Wales. Accessed 9 July 2008 A new era in the management of public records in New South Wales had begun. The Act stated that the \\"Archives Authority of New South Wales shall undertake the preservation, storage and arrangement, repair, cataloguing and calendaring, and have the custody and control, of the State archives and shall have the management of the Archives Office of New South Wales\\". The Archives Authority was also made responsible for the management of the New South Wales Government Records Repository and the Records Management Office of New South Wales.Archives Authority Agency Details, State Records New South Wales. Accessed 12 January 2008. Archives Authority The Archives Authority consisted of nine members, appointed by the Governor of New South Wales from the judiciary, legislature, universities and the New South Wales Public Service. The first Chairman of the Authority was Dr H.S. Wyndham CBE, MA, Ed D. Dip Ed and the Principal Archivist was Gordon D. Richardson. The work of the Authority mainly related to the examination of recommendations for the retention and disposal of public records. Archives and Records Management Offices This image is pre-1952 and shows the construction of The Maritime Services Building (now the Museum of Contemporary Art). The location of the Records Management Office in 1978 was on a street parallel to this building. The Archives Office was housed in extensions to the Public Library of New South Wales, which had been commenced in 1959 and included three floors specifically designed to accommodate the new office.Public Library of New South Wales stage 1State Records New South Wales. Accessed 9 July 2008 In 1976 the Archives Office became administratively separate from the Public Library of New South Wales and in late 1978 moved, with the Records Management Office to a new purpose built archives building at 2 Globe Street, The Rocks. Challenges for the Archives Office of New South Wales In the 1980s challenges facing the Archives Office were primarily related to the burgeoning interest in family history which reached a peak in 1988 and has never subsided. During this period there was a massive increase in the use of the archives and staff had to be reallocated to public areas to deal with the demand. The response to this almost overwhelming increase in the use of archival resources led to the establishment of a \\"Genealogical Research Kit\\" consisting of some of the more popular archives available to researchers. This was purchased by many libraries around NSW and reduced the demand on original documents. Government Records Repository In 1987 an extension to the Government Records Repository at Kingswood was completed. This included a public reading room, an exhibition area and conference facilities as well as specialised storage. At this time the reading room could accommodate up to fifty people and many of the key documents were available to users on microfilm, with the originals in storage at Globe Street, The Rocks. Regional Repositories Initially the concept of Regional Repositories started as an \\"archives on loan\\" scheme to place records which had been created in country areas, close to the originating community. The early 1980s saw a move to place archives at the University of New England, University of Newcastle, University of Wollongong, Riverina Murray Institute of Higher Education (now Charles Sturt University) and Newcastle Region Library. Archives were loaned to these institutions on the condition that they be properly looked after and made available to the local community for research. The regional repositories, with the addition of Broken Hill have grown into an informal network of archives in New South Wales that by 2005 contained a total of 4% of the State's archival holdings. State Records Act 1998 The most significant event in the 1990s for the management of archives and government records in New South Wales was the advent of the State Records Act in 1998. Not only did this mean a change of name for the organisation, but also meant a change of direction and additional responsibilities. For many years it had been realised by the Archives Office of NSW that the focus of the Archives Act 1960 was almost exclusively on archives, rather than on the full life cycle of government records from their inception to their archiving or destruction, the so-called records continuum. To address these issues the new legislation took into account the need for mandating the creation and capture of records, the creation of standards and guidelines, protection of records, recovery of archival \\"estrays\\" and public access to records over 30 years old. The span of control of the act also brought local councils, universities and area health services under the umbrella of State Records which added significantly to the workload of the organisation.State Records Agency Details, State Records New South Wales. Accessed 12 January 2008. Access to archives During the 1990s the Genealogical Research Kit which contained microfilm copies of popular key archival documents was expanded, renamed the Archives Resources Kit (ARK), and deposited at forty Community Access Points (CAPs), mainly public libraries, throughout New South Wales. This had the effect of reducing demand in the Reading Rooms at the Sydney and Western Sydney Records Centres. In addition to the Archives Resources Kit, work was going on behind the scenes to make more State archives available to external users electronically. In 2000 Archives Investigator was developed jointly by the State Records Authority of NSW and the Council of the City of Sydney. (The name refers to HMS Investigator, in which Matthew Flinders completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, 1801‚Äì1803, and mapped much of the coast for the first time.) This made a large number of archival series available online via the Internet. Work on Photo Investigator, a related database commenced in the early 2000s and by 2006 a considerable number of photographs from the archives were available to users online.Archives in brief 99, State Records New South Wales. Accessed 10 July 2008. Expansion of Government Records Repository 2005 saw the opening of the Stage 6 Building at the Government Records Repository at Kingswood by The Hon Bob Debus, Attorney General and Minister for the Arts. This building is equipped with geothermal air conditioning, high thermal mass insulation and an argon gas fire suppression system. In 2005 it was estimated that this building would fulfil the storage requirements of the NSW government for non-current records until 2011.

During the 1970s, CIC was the \\"most important agent of overseas distribution\\" for American films. In 1981, CIC merged with United Artists' international units and became United International Pictures. Formation of CIC, and the profit-sharing arrangement that made it work, has been described as the product of \\"revolutionary thinking\\".  Overview  In 1970, Paramount and Universal merged their international distribution arms into a new releasing company, Dutch-based Cinema International Corporation (CIC), based on the calculation that the costs of international distribution by individual companies was insufficiently profitable to be sustained. The original scope of distribution for CIC consisted of Europe, South America and South Africa. In November 1973, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer closed down its distribution offices and became a partner in CIC, which took over international distribution for MGM's films; this made CIC a fifty-percent shareholder of South Africa's Film Trust, an owner-operator of theaters, which persisted into 1976, when Film Trust bought its way out of the partnership. The theater operating concern co-owned by CIC and Film Trust was called Cinitrust. This had a secondary effect of supporting Paramount and Universal in expanding beyond their singular association in South Africa with Ster. By 1975, CIC was operating in forty-seven countries, and had distribution rights to about forty-percent of Hollywood's output. By 1976, Warner Brothers International began working with CIC on international distribution, including in South Africa. Beyond distribution, CIC had ventures with MGM and Warner Brothers International (CIC-MGM and CIC-Warner) for the operation of cinemas outside the United States. CIC also entered the home video market by forming CIC Video, which distributed Paramount and Universal titles on video worldwide. MGM however, had its own video unit, which later became a joint venture with CBS as MGM/CBS Home Video (later known as MGM/UA Home Video, which was later renamed MGM Home Entertainment). In 1981, MGM purchased United Artists, but could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with UA's overseas operations. However, with future film productions from both names being released domestically through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate, CIC decided to merge with UA's international units and reformed as United International Pictures on November 1st. By this time, CIC was one of the two largest distribution companies in the United Kingdom, the other being Columbia-EMI-Warners Distributors. The CIC name lived on in its video division, which became directly managed as a joint venture of Paramount Home Video and MCA Videocassette, Inc. (later MCA Home Video and MCA/Universal Home Video). CIC Video survived until the late 1990s/early 2000s, in 1999 when Universal purchased PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and reorganized its video division (which was a joint venture with what is now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and remains so to this day) under the Universal name, while Paramount took over full ownership of CIC Video and merged it under its own video division.  Controversy  Practices conducted through CIC have come to be considered anti-competitive and likely would have run afoul of anti-trust laws if conducted in the United States. \\\\----Note: this source contains an incorrect start date for the company: 1977. CIC made headlines in 2012 because both Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures denied ownership of director William Friedkin's film, Sorcerer. The studios claimed they transferred ownership to CIC, which later dissolved, causing the rights to be in limbo. In April 2012, Friedkin sued the studios to discover who owned the domestic theatrical rights and to capture any royalty payments from VHS and DVD releases. At one point, a court date for March 2013 was set if the parties could not reach a settlement. However, it was exactly that month that Friedkin revealed that he had dropped his lawsuit against Universal and Paramount, and that he and a \\"major studio\\" were involved in the creation of a new, recolored digital print of Sorcerer, to be screened at the Venice Film Festival and to receive a Blu-ray release:  See also  * Warner Bros.

Her father, Julius Paulus, was a Roman Nobleman of Greek descent and a historically noted jurist active throughout the Severan Dynasty becoming a praetorian prefect in Rome. She was thus of both Patrician Roman and Greek descent and was therefore part of the established upper Roman aristocracy. In early 219, Julia Maesa, eldest sister of Roman Empress Julia Domna, arranged for Cornelia Paula to marry her grandson, the new emperor Elagabalus. Their wedding was lavishly celebrated in Rome. Cornelia Paula became Elagabalus' first wife and was given the honorific title of Augusta and the family name \\"Julia\\". In late 220, Elagabalus divorced her to marry the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa in a union that was considered scandalous because she was still a Vestal. Apart from falling in love with Severa, Elagabalus married Severa as a part of the religious process of worshiping the Syrian Sun God El-Gabal and integrating El-Gabal into Roman religion. After the divorce, Elagabalus removed Paula's Augusta title. As they had no children, she withdrew from public life and her fate afterwards is unknown.

He was declared Righteous among the Nations by the government of Israel in 1968.  Early life  After two years (1926‚Äì28) with the Jesuits where he could not stay because of his frail health and weak contact with his religion, he entered the seminary of Namur. Ordained priest in 1936, he was teacher in a high school (Floreffe) for a few years before being appointed curate at the parish of St Jean-Baptiste (Namur).  Shelter for Jewish children  In 1941, with Belgium under German occupation, the parish youth center (located exactly next to the Gestapo 'Kommandantur' of Namur) became the hub of a vast clandestine organization under his leadership, aiming to save Jewish children from deportation and certain death. It was a transit house where children were sheltered - sometime more than 20 together - for as few days as possible before being entrusted to religious institutions or rural families where they could remain in hiding. To feed them, Fr Andr√© and his collaborators went about the country, from farm to farm, begging for food, hams, bread, cheese, and on the look out for more shelters for his prot√©g√©s. With a personal love for Jews and a profound respect for religious freedom, Father Andr√© never tried to convert or baptize the children. Though he was occasionally suspected by the Gestapo, and several times interrogated, his center and organization were never uncovered and remained active till the end of the war.  Friend of Israel  After the war he carried out social and charitable activities in connection with the Service social des Juifs of Belgium. Living very poorly by choice, he had an evangelical love for the marginalized and the lost. As Chaplain of the Namur jail from 1957 till his death, he opened a welcome center for ex-convicts, illegal migrants and political refugees: the 'Chateau de Bomel' (Namur). Always interested in the destiny of the Jewish people and fascinated by the mystery of Israel he closely followed the birth of the new state in 1948. In 1967 he received the highest honour of the nation: he was declared \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" and a tree in his name was planted in Yad Vashem.Joseph Andr√© at Yad Vashem The following year the frail man, always in a black cassock, was invited to New York City by the United Jewish Appeal and greeted by more than a thousand Jews.  Death  Fr Andr√© was found dead in his office of the Namur jail on 1 June 1973.

It grew from a small, one press firm to one of the world's largest printing companies in the mid-19th century. The company merged with Caxton Press, operated by William Moore in Beccles, Suffolk in the late 19th century and concentrated its business in the town following World War II. It is one of the UK‚Äôs largest manufacturers of directories and reference books and continues to operate out of its large printing factory at Ellough near Beccles as part of the CPI UK group.William Clowes, CPI UK. Retrieved 2011-06-25.Locations, CPI UK. Retrieved 2011-06-25. History Clowes established the firm on 21 October 1803 at 2 Villiers Street, London next to the Strand. The company was small in the beginning, having only one printing press and one assistant.Weedon.A (2004a) 'Clowes, William (1779‚Äì1847)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (available online), accessed 2011-06-25. Clowes worked for three days and nights to finish his first job, which satisfied the customer. Business soon grew from word of mouth, as customers were impressed with the company's speed and accuracy. =Expansion and steam powered presses= The company expanded in 1823 with the purchase of Northumberland Court and the installation of its first steam- powered presses (made by Applegath and Cowper). However, the new noisy presses disturbed the Duke of Northumberland, whose palace was nearby, and he ordered the company to cease operation. When Clowes refused, the case was tried in court in June 1824, where the printer won with the help of his attorney John Copley.Smiles.S (1884) 'William Clowes: introducer of book-printing by steam' in Men of invention and industry (available online at Project Gutenberg). Retrieved 2011-06-25. Clowes agreed to move the presses though in exchange for a sum paid by the Duke. The exchange proved fruitful for Clowes, as the bankruptcy of Archibald Constable caused a short period of bad business that afflicted the London publishing industry and the Duke's compensation helped offset the large losses Clowes experienced during this time. In 1826, the company purchased and moved to premises on Duke Street that had previously been occupied by Applegath and Cowper. The firm, which was renamed at William Clowes and Sons in 1839, grew rapidly, and by 1843 was one of the largest printing companies in the world: it operated 24 presses and had its own type and stereotype foundries, 2500 tonnes of stereotyped plates (at the time worth at least 500,000 pounds sterling), and a collection of 80,000 woodcuts. In 1847, Clowes died, and three of his sons, William Clowes the younger (1807‚Äì1883), Winchester, and George, took over running the company. In 1851, the company secured a large contract to print half a million catalogues for the Great Exhibition. The project involved the use of 50 tonnes of type, 30,000 reams of paper and three tonnes of ink.Weedon.A (2004b) 'Clowes, William, the younger (1807‚Äì1883)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, (available online), accessed 2011-06-25. =Merger with Caxton Press= In 1873, William Clowes the younger's eldest son, William Archibald Clowes (1843‚Äì1904), and his nephew William Charles Knight Clowes (1838‚Äì1917) entered a partnership with William Moore, who operated the Caxton Press in Beccles, Suffolk. Although Moore suddenly disappeared, leaving a considerable debt, the firm survived and was re-established as Clowes and Clowes. It grew from operating four presses to 15 in just three years. In 1880, Clowes and Clowes merged with William Clowes & Sons to form William Clowes Ltd. =Relocation to Beccles= The company continued operating into the 20th century, but suffered a setback during World War II, when the Blitz destroyed its Duke Street offices. Following the war, the firm decided to concentrate on expanding its presses in Beccles. In the late 1970s, computerised phototypesetting was introduced to the company which has continued to invest in digital technology. The company sold its old Beccles premises in 2003 and moved to a new, custom-built factory at Ellough on the outskirts of Beccles in 2004.Staff call for safe route to work, BBC news website, 2008-02-28.

It began in 1932 as the Fellowship of St. Luke, and was founded by John Gaynor Banks, an Episcopal priest.[Order of St. Luke OSL Handbook] The Order is ecumenical, with members belonging to a variety of Christian denominations. The Order is international, with a presence not only in the United States, but also in Canada, Belize, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and India. Outside of North America, it is organized by country. In Greater North America, it is a single entity. Members engage in healing prayer with those who are physically ill, emotionally troubled or in other distress, often with the laying on of hands. Members may be clergy or laypeople, Ministry by members of the Order is seen and experienced as an extension, but not a replacement for other parts of Christian religious observance and practice. Healing Communities, or groups of members of the Order, meet together regularly to study Scripture and engage in prayer. There are hundreds of healing communities within this organization in the United States, Canada, Belize, and Jamaica. Preamble of the Order The New Testament reveals that healing is an essential part of the teaching and practice of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that he commissions his followers to preach the gospel of the kingdom and to heal the sick. The Order of St Luke the Physician comprises clergy and laity of the Christian church who believe that the Holy Scriptures set forth healing as a continuing and essential part of the ministry committed to the church by Jesus Christ. Members of the Order are called to make the ministry of healing a regular part of their Christian life. WE AFFIRM THAT: the foundation of belief and practice in the Order is the doctrine of the Trinity; God's intention for his creation is perfect; sin is the root cause of all disharmony within people, between people and in the universe; the perfect will of God is complete redemption from sin, sickness and all consequences of the fall; the basis of this redemption, including healing, is that reconciliation with the Father accomplished by Jesus Christ once for all on the cross; the Holy Spirit makes personally effective what the risen, ascended and everliving Christ has accomplished; faith in Jesus Christ is the only means whereby this redemption is appropriated; wholeness of spirit, soul and body rather than physical healing alone is the goal of the Order; this wholeness usually involves co-operation between members of the church and members of the medical and paramedicai professions; and the Order is committed to supporting or initiating such cooperation. Emblem of the Order The emblem of the Order is blue in the form of a cross within a circle, which together make an acrostic. Blue is the symbolic colour of healing, associated with restful and calming properties. The Latin motto: JESU ESTO MIHI JESUS LUX REX DUX LEX means: O Jesus, be to me my Saviour (Healer), Light King Leader Law According to tradition, this cross was found in the catacombs of Domitilla in Rome during the second century. It is the prayer discovered by a Roman nobleman, whose wife had been the guide and inspiration of his life. When she died, he felt the light of his life had been extinguished. Restless and distraught, he wandered aimlessly until he heard the Christian gospel and found the prayer inscribed on the wall of the catacombs. He accepted Christ and made this prayer the rule of his life.

More than 80 enthusiastic OSL supporters from across Canada and several from the USA attended the four day healing conference at the Mennonite University in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Delegates were treated to a wealth of keynote addresses and workshops on several aspects of Christian healing. A vote taken at the business meeting resulted in OSL Canada being launched! OSL Canada will remain a faithful and important partner with The International Order of St Luke the Physician, the North America organization headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. OSL Canada will serve the Canadian network of OSL Members and Chapters with communications specific to Canadian interest and activities. Our mission is to return the healing ministry of Jesus to its place in the church, to be a resource for individuals and clergy who want to learn more about offering healing during worship services and developing healing prayer ministry teams. Our mandate is to bring the power and healing grace of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, to individual lives. OSL Canada is poised to make a valuable contribution to the ministry of Christian healing, and to the growth of the Order of St Luke in North America.

The reserve is administered by New Zealand's Department of Conservation (DOC).Ruakuri Caves & Bush Scenic Reserve (from the New Zealand Department of Conservation website) With a length of over 12 km of explored passages, it is New Zealand's 6th largest known cave system, and the largest in the North Island.Longest New Zealand Caves (from the New Zealand Speleological Society website. Retrieved 11 December 2007.) Description The caves making up the Gardner's Gut system are almost all composed of former or still active 'stream caves' (i.e. tunnels washed out of the limestone by water action). It is a very well known cave in New Zealand, and probably one of the most visited 'amateur' caves in the country (as opposed to tourist caves providing guided tours, like nearby Waitomo Cave). Various caving clubs from throughout the North Island use it for beginner trips, as it provides a variety of true caving experiences (such as squeeze points, narrow and winding streamways, large underground halls, fascinating formations and bush tramping to get to and from the entrances), yet is easy enough to pass through for any reasonably fit and non-claustrophobic person. The normal beginners area of the cave is around the Zweihoehlen-entrance ('Two Caves' in German) near the river. Associated with the large number of amateur trips (whether accompanied by professional cavers or not) is a certain level of degradation in the cave. As cave systems are very fragile environments, many parts of Gardner's Gut cave have been damaged by the relatively frequent visits of inexperienced cavers (with, for example, formations broken off, and limestone formations dirtied, which prevents their continuing growth). However, this damage is almost invisible to a casual amateur. One of the most impressive features of the cave is the 'Birthday Candle', the tallest stalagmite in the country, being around 6‚Äì7 meters high and having a diameter of around 2 meters.Te Rauamoa: Waitomo and Te Kuiti \\"Birthday Candle\\" stalagmite in Gardner's Gut cave, Waitomo (from the Te Araroa Trust website.

He was prosecuted as I. Lewis Libby, also known as \\"Scooter Libby\\". National Public Radio's Day to Day reported that the 1972 Yale Banner (the yearbook of Yale University) gave his name as Irve Lewis Libby Jr.; it is unclear if Irve is his given name, or if it is short for Irving, as it was for his father. CBS, the BBC,Paul Reynolds, \\"Indictment Rocks Bush Administration\\", BBC News, October 28, 2007; accessed July 16, 2007. and the New York Timess John Tierney have all used this spelling of his first name. The Timess Eric Schmitt spelled it Irv, though he cited a phone interview with Libby's brother, and did not clarify if he had asked for a spelling. At times, including in the Yale Banner, and as documented in a federal directory cited by Ron Kampeas and others, Libby has used the suffix Jr. after his name. At other times, however, as listed in his federal indictment and United States v. Libby, which give his alias as Scooter Libby, there is no Jr. after Libby's name. The Columbia Alumni Association online directory lists him as I. Lewis Libby, with a first name of \\"I.\\" and birth first name of \\"Irve\\". Nickname Libby has also been secretive about the origin of his nickname Scooter. The New York Timess Eric Schmitt, citing the aforementioned interview with Libby's brother, wrote that \\"His nickname 'Scooter' derives from the day [his] father watched him crawling in his crib and joked, 'He's a Scooter! In their February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, King asked Libby specifically, \\"Where did 'Scooter' come from?\\"; Libby replied: \\"Oh, it goes way back to when I was a kid.

Bar R. XI, ¬ß 14(g).\\" The brief lists Libby's admission to practice law in that jurisdiction as May 19, 1978. At that time Libby's lawyers filed notification of his intention to appeal his conviction within ten days after his sentencing with the D.C. Bar, an appeal that he subsequently decided to drop (Cf. Apuzzo's account of December 10, 2007, op cit) Libby practiced law at Schnader for six years before joining the U.S. State Department policy planning staff, at the invitation of his former Yale professor, Paul Wolfowitz, in 1981. In 1985, returning to private practice, he joined the firm then known as Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin (now Dickstein Shapiro LLP), becoming a partner in 1986 and working there until 1989, when he left to work in the U.S. Defense Department, again under his former Yale professor Paul Wolfowitz, until January 1993.\\"Leonard Garment and Four Other Mudge Rose Lawyers Join Washington, D.C.

In 1993, returning to private legal practice from government, Libby became the managing partner of the Washington, D.C. office of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon (formerly Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, and Alexander); in 1995, along with his Mudge Rose colleague, Leonard Garment‚Äì‚Äìwho had replaced John Dean as acting Special Counsel to U.S. President Richard Nixon for the last two years of his presidency dominated by Watergate, and who had hired Libby at Mudge Rose twenty years later‚Äì‚Äìand three other lawyers from that firm, Libby joined the Washington, D.C. office of Dechert Price & Rhoads (now part of Dechert LLP), where he was a managing partner, a member of its litigation department, and chaired its Public Policy Practice Group.

Fugitive billionaire commodities trader Marc Rich, who, along with his business partner Pincus Green, had been indicted of tax evasion and illegal trading with Iran, and who, with Green, was ultimately pardoned by President Bill Clinton, was a client whom Leonard Garment had hired Libby to help represent around the spring of 1985, after Rich and Green had first engaged Garment.For a detailed commentary on the contexts of Libby's work on the Rich case, see 32‚Äì33 of \\"'Take Jack's Word': The Pardons of International Fugitives Marc Rich and Pincus Green\\" (Chap.

Libby stopped representing Rich in the spring of 2000; early in March 2001, at a \\"contentious\\" Congressional hearing to review Clinton's pardons, Libby testified that he thought the prosecution's case against Rich \\"misconstrued the facts and the law\\".CNN, \\"GOP Lawyer: Facts 'misconstrued' in Rich Case\\", CNN (Archives), March 2, 2001, accessed February 16, 2007. According to Jackson Hogan, Libby's roommate at Yale University, as quoted in the already- cited U.S. News & World Report article by Walsh, He is intensely partisan ... in that if he is your counsel, he'll embrace your case and try to figure a way out of whatever noose you are ensnared in. According to a House Committee on Government Reform report, however, \\"The arguments made by Garment, [William Bradford] Reynolds and Libby [in their testimony] focused on the claim that the SDNY was criminalizing what should have been a civil tax case. They did not make, compile, or in any other way lay the groundwork for, or make a case for a Presidential pardon. When former President Clinton stated that they 'reviewed and advocated' 'the case for the pardons,' he suggested that they were somehow involved in arguing that Rich and Green should receive pardons. This was completely untrue\\". (p. 162) =Bar suspension and disbarment= Before his indictment in United States v.

Government public service and political career In 1981, after working as a lawyer in the Philadelphia firm Schnader LLP, Libby accepted the invitation of his former Yale University political science professor and mentor Paul Wolfowitz to join the U.S. State Department's policy planning staff. From 1982 to 1985, Libby served as director of special projects in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. In 1985 he received the Foreign Affairs Award for Public Service from the United States Department of Defense, and he resigned from government to enter private legal practice at Dickstein, Shapiro, and Morin. In 1989, he went to work at the Pentagon, again under Wolfowitz, as principal deputy under- secretary for strategy and resources at the U.S. Defense Department. During the George H. W. Bush administration, Libby was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as deputy under secretary of defense for policy, serving from 1992 to 1993. In 1992 he also served as legal adviser for the House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China. Libby co-authored the draft of the Defense Planning Guidance for the 1994‚Äì99 fiscal years (dated February 18, 1992) with Wolfowitz for Dick Cheney, who was then Secretary of Defense. In 1993 Libby received the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Defense Department and the Distinguished Public Service Award from the U.S. State Department before resuming private legal practice first at Mudge Rose and then at Dechert. Libby was part of a network of neo-conservatives known as the \\"Vulcans\\"‚Äîits other members included Wolfowitz, Condoleezza Rice, and Donald Rumsfeld. While he was still a managing partner of Dechert Price & Rhoads, he was a signatory to the \\"Statement of Principles\\" of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) (a document dated June 3, 1997).Elliott Abrams, et al., \\"Statement of Principles\\", June 3, 1997; accessed May 28, 2007.

He was also nicknamed \\"Dick Cheney's Dick Cheney\\" for his close working relationship with the Vice President. Mary Matalin, who worked with Libby as an adviser to Cheney during Bush's first term, said of him \\"He is to the vice president what the vice president is to the president.\\" Libby was active in the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee of the Pentagon when it was chaired by Richard Perle during the early years of the George W. Bush administration (2001‚Äì2003). At various points in his career, Libby has also held positions with the American Bar Association, been on the advisory board of the RAND Corporation's Center for Russia and Eurasia, and been a legal adviser to the United States House of Representatives, as well as served as a consultant for the defense contractor Northrop Grumman. Libby was also actively involved in the Bush administration's efforts to negotiate the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian \\"road map\\" for peace; for example, he participated in a series of meetings with Jewish leaders in early December 2002 and a meeting with two aides of then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in mid-April 2003, culminating in the Red Sea Summit on June 4, 2004.Matthew E.

His resignation was announced by the Hudson Institute in a press release dated March 8, 2007. However, he has served as Senior Vice President of the Hudson Institute at least since 2010. Libby also serves as a member of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group that encourages and advocates changes to government policy to strengthen national biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. Involvement in the Plame affair Between 2003 and 2005, intense speculation centered on the possibility that Libby may have been the administration official who had \\"leaked\\" classified employment information about Valerie Plame, a covert Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the wife of Iraq War critic Joseph C. Wilson, to New York Times reporter Judith Miller and other reporters and later tried to hide his having done so.Farhad Manjoo, \\"War Room: Did Scooter Libby Try to Hide His Meeting with Judith Miller?\\", Salon, October 11, 2005; accessed June 28, 2007.David Corn, \\"Will Scooter Libby Graymail the CIA?\\", Capital Games (blog), The Nation, February 6, 2006; accessed April 18, 2007. In August 2005, as revealed in grand jury testimony audiotapes played during the trial and reported in many news accounts, Libby testified that he met with Judith Miller, a reporter with the New York Times, on July 8, 2003, and discussed Plame with her.\\"Libby's Complete Grand Jury Testimony\\", transcript and NPR audio player clips, National Public Radio, February 9, 2007; accessed June 29, 2007. Although Libby signed a \\"blanket waiver\\" allowing journalists to discuss their conversations with him pursuant to the CIA leak grand jury investigation, Miller maintained that such a waiver did not serve to allow her to reveal her source to that grand jury; moreover, Miller argued that Libby's general waiver pertaining to all journalists could have been coerced and that she would only testify before that grand jury if given an individual waiver.For transcripts of the trial testimony, including that by Judith Miller, \\"edited & with reporting by Murray Waas\\", see Murray Waas, ed., with Jeff Lomonaco, The United States v. I. Lewis Libby (New York: Union Square Press (imprint of Sterling Publishing), 2007); (10); (13). After refusing to testify about her July 2003 meeting with Libby, Judith Miller was jailed on July 7, 2005, for contempt of court. Months later, however, her new attorney, Robert Bennett, told her that she already had possessed a written, voluntary waiver from Libby all along.Margaret Carlson, \\"Time's Pearlstine Looks Back at Plamegate, Blames Floyd Abrams\\", Bloomberg.com, last updated June 27, 2007; accessed June 29, 2007. After Miller had served most of her sentence, Libby reiterated that he had indeed given her a \\"waiver\\" both \\"voluntarily and personally.\\" He attached the following letter, which, when released publicly, became the subject of further speculation about Libby's possible motives in sending it: > As noted above, my lawyer confirmed my waiver to other reporters in just the > way he did with your lawyer. Why? Because as I am sure will not be news to > you, the public report of every other reporter's testimony makes clear that > they did not discuss Ms. Plame's name or identity with me, or knew about her > before our call. > . ... > You went to jail in the summer.

After agreeing to testify, Miller was released on September 29, 2005, appearing before the grand jury the next day, but the charge against her was rescinded only after she testified again on October 12, 2005. For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003, two weeks before Wilson's New York Times op-ed was published.Judith Miller, \\"A Personal Account: My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room\\", New York Times, October 16, 2005; accessed March 23, 2008. In her account published in the Times on October 16, 2005, based on her notes, Miller reports: > ... in an interview with me on June 23 [2003], Vice President Dick Cheney's > chief of staff, I.

Her notation on her July 8, 2003 meeting with Libby does contain the name \\"Valerie Flame \\", which she added retrospectively. While Miller reveals publicly that she herself had misidentified the last name of Wilson's wife (aka \\"Valerie Plame\\") in her own marginal notes on their interview as \\"Flame\\" instead of \\"Plame\\", in her grand jury (and later trial testimony), she remained uncertain when, how, and why she arrived at that name and did not attribute it to Libby: > I was not permitted to take notes of what I told the grand jury, and my > interview notes on Mr. Libby are sketchy in places.

A year and a half later, a jury convicted Libby of obstruction of justice and perjury in his grand jury testimony and making false statements to federal investigators about when and how he learned that Plame was a CIA agent.Michael J. Sniffen and Matt Apuzzo (Associated Press),\\"Libby Found Guilty in CIA Leak Trial: Ex-Cheney Aide Libby Found Guilty of Obstruction, Perjury, Lying to the FBI in CIA Leak Case\\", ABC News, March 6, 2007; accessed June 10, 2007. On April 13, 2018, Libby was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Indictment and resignation On October 28, 2005, as a result of the CIA leak grand jury investigation, Special Counsel Fitzgerald indicted Libby on five counts: one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of making false statements when interviewed by agents of the FBI, and two counts of perjury in his testimony before the grand jury.\\"Transcript of General Hayden's Interview with WTOP\\", June 1, 2007Joel Seidman, \\"Plame Was 'covert' Agent At Time of Name Leak\\", MSNBC.com, May 29, 2007; accessed June 10, 2007.Neil A. Lewis, \\"Source of C.I.A.

The indictment alleges that statements to federal investigators and the grand jury were intentionally false, in that Libby had numerous conversations about Mrs. Wilson's CIA employment, including his conversations with Judith Miller (see above), before speaking to Russert; Russert did not tell Libby about Mrs. Wilson's CIA employment; prior to talking with such reporters, Libby knew with certainty that she was employed by the CIA; and Libby told reporters that she worked for the CIA without making any disclaimer that he was uncertain of that fact. The false statements counts in the Libby indictment charge that he intentionally made those false statements to the FBI; the perjury counts charge that he intentionally lied to the grand jury in repeating those false statements; and the obstruction of justice count charges that Libby intentionally made those false statements in order to mislead the grand jury, thus impeding Fitzgerald's grand jury investigation of the truth about the leaking of Mrs. Wilson's then-classified, covert CIA identity. Trial, conviction, and sentencing On March 6, 2007, the jury convicted him on four of the five counts but acquitted him on count three, the second charge of making false statements when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with Time reporter Matthew Cooper.\\"I. Lewis Libby Jr. (Index): The Counts\\", The New York Times, Times Topics, updated periodically, March 6, 2007, accessed July 6, 2007. After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the Associated Press, David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, I just want to tell you, I didn't do it' ...

Libby's criminal trial, United States v. Libby, began on January 16, 2007. A parade of Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalists testified, including Bob Woodward, Walter Pincus and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Judith Miller and David E. Sanger of The New York Times. Despite earlier press reports and widespread speculation, neither Libby nor Vice President Cheney testified. The jury began deliberations on February 21, 2007. =Verdict= After deliberating for 10 days, the jury rendered its verdict on March 6, 2007.Jeralyn Merritt, \\"Verdict in the Libby Trial\\", transcript, The Washington Post (\\"Live Online\\" discussion), March 6, 2007 It convicted Libby on four of the five counts against him: two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice in a grand jury investigation, and one of the two counts of making false statements to federal investigators.David Stout and Neil Lewis, \\"Libby Guilty of Lying in C.I.A.

(Access limited to one viewing per day.) The trial confirmed that the leak came first from then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage; since Fitzgerald did not charge Armitage and did not charge anyone else, Libby's conviction effectively ended the investigation. In his October 28, 2005, press conference about the grand jury's indictment, Fitzgerald had already explained that Libby's obstruction of justice through perjury and false statements had prevented the grand jury from determining whether the leak violated federal law.Transcript of Special Counsel Fitzgerald's press conference, The Washington Post, October 28, 2005; accessed June 8, 2007. During his media appearance outside the courtroom after the verdict in the Libby case, Fitzgerald fielded questions from the press about others involved in the Plame affair and in the CIA leak grand jury investigation, such as Armitage and Cheney, whom he had already described as under \\"a cloud\\", as already addressed in his conduct of the case and in his closing arguments in court.Transcript and video clips presented on Hardball with Chris Matthews, NBC News, March 6, 2007Jeralyn Merritt, \\"Fitz Closing in Libby; Cheney Is Under a Cloud\\" TalkLeft (accredited press blog), February 24, 2007; accessed June 8, 2007, observes that \\"Fitzgerald squarely blames Libby for putting the cloud on the Vice President,\\" quoting from Fitzgerald's closing arguments, e.g.: > There is a cloud over the vice president.

On June 5, 2007, after the announcement of Libby's sentencing, CNN News reported that Libby still \\"plans to appeal the verdict\\". That day, in response to the sentencing, Vice President Cheney issued a statement in Libby's defense on The White House website.

Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby that he would have 10 days to appeal the ruling. In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: \\"Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general.\\" The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal.Cf. \\"Motion for Leave to File Brief As Amici Curiae and Brief of Law Professors Vikram Amar, Randy Barnett, Robert Bork, Alan Dershowitz, Viet D.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued a press release about the verdict, urging Bush to pledge not to pardon Libby, and other Democratic politicians followed his lead.Harry Reid, press release, democrats.senate.gov March 6, 2007; accessed April 5, 2007; cf. news account in \\"Democrats to Bush: Don't Pardon Libby\\", CNN News, March 7, 2007; accessed April 5, 2007 Surveying \\"the pardon battle\\" and citing both pro and con publications, The Washington Post online columnist Dan Froomkin concludes that many U.S. newspapers opposed a presidential pardon for Libby.Dan Froomkin, \\"Many Newspapers Oppose Pardon\\", White House Watch (column and blog), washingtonpost.com, June 7, 2007; accessed June 7, 2007. Much of this commentary obscured the fact that the clemency power provided the President with several options short of a full, unconditional pardon. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, former federal prosecutor and conservative activist William Otis argued the sentence was too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, Bush should commute his sentence.\\"Neither Prison Nor Pardon: Justice in the Libby Case Lies With Bush's Third Option\\" by William Otis, The Washington Post, June 7, 2007: A-27; posted online June 7, 2007; accessed June 7, 2007.

It wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss the case until after the legal remedies have run its course.\\"Jim Rutenberg, \\"Bush in Dilemma on Libby Pardon\\", International Herald Tribune, June 7, 2007; accessed June 7, 2007. Ultimately, less than a month later, on July 2, 2007, Bush chose Otis's 'third option' ‚Äî \\"neither prison nor pardon\\" ‚Äî in commuting Libby's prison sentence.George W. Bush, \\"Grant of Executive Clemency: A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America\\", The White House, July 2, 2007 After Libby was denied bail during his appeal process on July 2, 2007, Bush commuted Libby's 30-month federal prison sentence, calling it \\"excessive\\", but he did not change the other parts of the sentence and their conditions. That presidential commutation left in place the felony conviction, the $250,000 fine, and the terms of probation. Some have criticized the move, as presidential commutations are rarely issued, but when granted they have generally occurred after the convicted person has already served a substantial portion of his or her sentence: \\"We can't find any cases, certainly in the last half-century, where the president commuted a sentence before it had even started to be served,\\" said former Justice Department pardon attorney Margaret Colgate Love. Others, notably Cheney himself who argued that Libby was unfairly charged by a politically motivated prosecution, believed that the commutation fell short, as Libby would likely never practice law again. At the time, Bush explained his \\"Grant of Executive Clemency\\" to Libby, in part, as follows: :Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. Bush's explanation was written by Fred F. Fielding, White House Counsel during the last two years of Bush's presidency. According to a Time Magazine article published six months after Bush left office, Fielding worded the commutation \\"in a way that would make it harder for Bush to revisit it in the future ... ; [the] language was intended to send an unmistakable message, internally as well as externally: No one is above the law.\\" The article suggested that there was a fundamental difference between how Bush and Cheney viewed the \\"War on Terror\\", with aides close to Bush feeling that Cheney had misled the President and damaged the administration's moral character with the Plame leak. Libby's lawyer, Theodore V. Wells, Jr. \\"issued a brief statement saying Mr. Libby and his family 'wished to express their gratitude for the president's decision ... We continue to believe in Mr. Libby's innocence'. ... \\" Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, however, took issue with Bush's description of the sentence as 'excessive', saying it was \\"[i]mposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country ... It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals ... [T]hat principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing,\\" Fitzgerald said.Qtd. by CNN, \\"Bush Commutes Libby's Prison Sentence\\", CNN News, July 2, 2007 (updated periodically), accessed July 3, 2007. The day after the commuting of Libby's sentence, James Rowley (Bloomberg News) reported that Bush had not ruled out pardoning Libby in the future and that Bush's press spokesman, Tony Snow, denied any political motivation in the commutation. Quoting Snow, Rowley added: The president is getting pounded on the right because he didn't do a full pardon.' If Bush were 'doing the weather-vane thing' he 'would have done something differently.James Rowley, \\"Bush Won't Rule Out Pardon for Libby as Aide Defends Clemency\\", Bloomberg.com July 3, 2007.For his full published statement in response to the commutation and the press conference about it by Bush's press spokesman Tony Snow, see Joseph C.

Democratic politicians' responses stressed their outrage at what they called a disgraceful abrogation of justice, and, that evening CNN reported that Representative John Conyers, Jr., Democrat of Michigan, announced that there would be a formal Congressional investigation of Bush's commutation of Libby's sentence and other presidential reprieves.Anderson Cooper, \\"Breaking News\\", Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, broadcast on CNN, July 3, 2007; accessed July 3, 2007; cf. \\"Political Bulletin: Bush Bashed Over Libby Commutation: Furious Democrats Will Hold Hearings\\", US News and World Reports, July 3, 2007; accessed July 3, 2007.\\"Political Bulletin: Bush Bashed Over Libby Commutation: Furious Democrats Will Hold Hearings\\", US News and World Reports, Washington News, July 3, 2007; accessed July 3, 2007.See also \\"President Commutes Libby's Sentence\\", Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, July 3, 2007; accessed July 4, 2007. The hearing on \\"The Use and Misuse of Presidential Clemency Power for Executive Branch Officials\\" was held by the United States House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Conyers, on July 11, 2007. In his public statement accompanying his executive clemency proclamation, Bush stated that he believes the sentence \\"harsh ... based in part on allegations never presented to the jury,\\" that \\"[the] reputation [Libby] gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged,\\" and that \\"[the] consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting.\\" Libby paid the required fine of \\"$250,400, which included a 'special assessment' of costs\\" that same day. Just a few days later, however, Judge Walton questioned \\"whether ... [Libby] will face two years of probation, as [President Bush] said he would,\\" because the supervised release time is conditioned on Libby's serving the prison sentence, and he \\"directed the special prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, and ... [Libby's] lawyers to file arguments on the point. ... \\" \\"If Judge Walton does not impose any supervised release, it could undercut ... [Bush's] argument that ... Libby still faced stiff justice.\\" That issue was resolved on July 10, 2007, clearing the way for Libby to begin serving the rest of his sentence, the supervised release and 400 hours of community service. In response to Bush's justifications for clemency, liberal commentator Harlan J. Protass noted that in Rita v. United States,Rita v. United States, online posting in Supreme Court Collection, Legal Resource Institute, Cornell University Law School; accessed July 4, 2007. the case of a defendant convicted of perjury in front of a grand jury which had been decided two weeks earlier by the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. government had successfully argued that sentences that fall within Federal Sentencing Guidelines are presumed to be \\"reasonable\\", regardless of individual circumstances. Reportedly outraged by Bush's commutation of Libby's prison sentence, on July 2, 2007, Wilson told CNN: \\"I have nothing to say to Scooter Libby ... I don't owe this administration. They owe my wife and my family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor. Bush's action ... demonstrates that the White House is corrupt from top to bottom.\\" He reiterated this perspective on the commutation in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on July 11, 2007, vehemently protesting that a Republican congressman was engaging in \\"yet a further smear of my wife's good name and my good name.\\" According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll conducted from July 6 to July 8, 2007, \\"most Americans disagree with President George W. Bush's decision to intervene\\" on Libby's behalf in the case.Jeffrey M. Jones (Gallup News Service), \\"Two in Three Say Bush Should Not Have Intervened in Libby Case: Only 13% Say Commuting Sentence Was Right Thing to Do\\", USA Today/Gallup Poll, July 10, 2007, accessed July 10, 2007: \\"The July 6‚Äì8 poll finds 66% of Americans saying Bush should not have intervened on Libby's behalf. Only 13% say Bush was 'right to commute Libby's sentence,' while even fewer, 6%, say Bush 'should have gone farther and granted [Libby] a full pardon.' About one in six have no opinion of the matter.\\" Several months after Bush's action, Judge Walton commented publicly on it. He spoke in favor of applying the law equally, stating: \\"The downside [of the commutation] is there are a lot of people in America who think that justice is determined to a large degree by who you are and that what you have plays a large role in what kind of justice you receive. ... \\" Bush took no further action with respect to Libby's conviction or sentence during his presidential term, despite entreaties from conservatives that he should be pardoned. Two days after their term expired, former Vice President Cheney expressed his regret that Bush had not pardoned Libby on his last day in office. =Press coverage of Libby's trial= Blogs played a prominent role in the press coverage of Libby's trial. Scott Shane, in his article \\"For Liberal Bloggers, Libby Trial Is Fun and Fodder\\", published in The New York Times on February 15, 2007, quotes Robert Cox, president of the Media Bloggers Association, who wrote that the trial was \\"the first federal case for which independent bloggers have been given official credentials along with reporters from the traditional news media.\\"Scott Shane, \\"For Brigade of Liberal Bloggers, the Libby Trial Is Fun and Fodder\\", The New York Times, February 15, 2007; updated with appended correction, February 17, 2007, accessed March 24, 2007.The Scooter Libby Trial, Media Bloggers Association, February 20, 2007 ‚Äì June 28, 2007 (updated periodically), accessed June 30, 2007. The trial was followed in the mass media and engaged the interest of both professional legal experts and the general public. While awaiting the judge's ruling pertaining to supervised release and the \\"400 hours of community service that Judge Walton imposed\\", for example, bloggers discussed the legal issues involved in these non- commuted parts of Libby's sentence and their effects on Libby's future life experiences.Jeralyn Merritt, \\"All Sides Agree Libby Should Serve Supervised Release\\", TalkLeft (accredited press blog), July 9, 2007; accessed July 10, 2007 (Provides links to PDF versions of the various legal briefs.) =Criticism of investigation= On August 28, 2006, Christopher Hitchens asserted that Richard Armitage was the primary source of the Valerie Plame leak and that Fitzgerald knew this at the beginning of his investigation. This was supported a month later by Armitage himself, who stated that Fitzgerald had instructed him not to go public with this information.

Located north of Al-Buzuriyah Souq in the Ancient City of Damascus, the palace was built in 1749 and was the private residence for As'ad Pasha al- Azm, the governor of Damascus, and during the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon it housed the French Institute. After being purchased by the Syrian government from the Al-Azm family and undergoing several reconstruction works, the palace now houses the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions. History The northern facade of the courtyard The palace was built during the Ottoman era over the former site of a Mamluk palace as a residence for the governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm during the reign of Sultan Mahmud I. Serving as a joint residence and guesthouse, the palace was a monument to 18th-century Arab architecture. The palace was built by 800 workers in a span of three years,ŸÇÿµÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∏ŸÖ ŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿßŸÑŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿ®ÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇ10/01/2013 - ÿπÿØÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ°ÿßÿ™ : 9419 (In Arabic) and the building was decorated with highly sophisticated and expensive decorative elements. A local Damascene barber, Shaikh Ahmad Al-Bidiri Al-Halaq recorded in his diary how \\"every time he [Al-Azm] heard of an antiquity or rare work of marble or porcelain, he would send someone to get it - with or without the owner's consent\\". After al-Azm's death, the palace continued to house his descendants for generations later. While touring Damascus in 1898, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany visited the palace.ŸÇÿµÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∏ŸÖ - ÿßŸÉÿ™ÿ¥ŸÅ ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ© (In Arabic) The courtyard and garden of the palace The palace remained in the ownership of the Azm family until 1920, when the palace was sold to the French. The central court or haremlek was purchased for 4000 gold pounds (after 1958 the currency unit name in English changed from \\"Lira\\" to \\"Pound\\"). During the Great Syrian Revolution, the French government shelled Damascus to put down the rebellion, and the old quarter of Damascus was shelled which caused extensive damage to the palace, as the main reception room, the private baths and the roofs were all set on fire while the walls were destroyed. Following the end of the revolution, the French government set about reconstructing the buildings. The restoration work began immediately and was handled by architects Lucien Cavaro, and Michel Ecochard. The architects conducted a simplified, less ornate reconstruction of the palace. Following reconstruction, the French government used the palace to house the newly created French Institute, and Michel Ecochard, who worked in reconstructing the site, was commissioned to design a new house for the director of the institute. Although fairly modern, the new building blended perfectly into the 18th century walls of the palace. Upon Syrian independence in 1946, the French Institute was dissolved and evacuated from the building and the house was returned to the Azm family, six years later in 1951 it was purchased by the Syrian government for 100,000 pounds ($30,000), which turned it into the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions. Shafiq Imam was appointed the director of the museum, which opened in 1954. The crowd for the museum's opening greatly exceeded expectations that led Shafiq Imam to design a new staircase for the main hall to allow visitors to enter from one side and leave from another. The palace received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1983. Architecture Details of the stonework in the palace The palace is 6400 m¬≤, and its architecture is an excellent example of Damascene traditional houses. The structure consists of several buildings and three wings: the harem, the selamlek and the khademlek. The harem is the family wing, which contains the private residences of the family and includes the baths, which are a replica of the public baths in the city on a smaller scale. The selamlek is the guest wing, and it comprises the formal halls, reception areas and large courtyards with traditional cascading fountain, while in the northern part of the palace were the servant quarters and the center of housekeeping activities. One of the palace's most interesting parts is the hammam, or baths. It is composed of a succession of small rooms and narrow corridors leading to the main steam room in the heart of the building. Near the hammam is the main marble-floored reception hall, and behind it is a second, smaller courtyard with a number of rooms now used to display various traditional crafts such as glass, copper and textiles. Used in the building of this palace were several types of stones including limestone, sandstone, basalt, and marble, chosen to provide a natural decoration. The ceilings have painted wooden panels that display natural scenes. Dr. Andrew Petersen, director of Research in Islamic Archaeology at the University of Wales Lampeter states that the use of ablaq (alternating courses of white limestone and black basalt) in this building is ‚ÄúA characteristic of the monumental masonry of Damascus.‚Äù See also * Ablaq * Azm Palace (Hama) References External links Category:Old Damascene houses Category:Palaces in Syria Category:Museums in Syria Category:Houses completed in 1750 Category:Buildings and structures inside the walled city of Damascus Category:1750 establishments in Ottoman Syria Category:18th-century establishments in Ottoman Syria ","title":"Azm Palace"},{"id":"9910454","text":"Bushra Farrukh (; born 16 February 1957), is a Pakistani poet.

In addition to her compositional gifts, Benna Moe was an organ soloist, pianist and singer. She composed music for orchestra, chamber ensembles, and organ music. Most known among her works is the ballet Hybris, which was premiered in Copenhagen in 1930. Her compositions, Hymn of Praise (4th movement of Alpine Suite), Shepherds‚Äô Flutes (2nd movement of Alpine Suite) and Cantilena have been used at royal weddings.www.crownprincecouple.dk  Early life  Moe entered the Moltke Citizen School for girls, and it was here that her special musical abilities stimulated her musical participation. Moe often played at school party events and family gatherings, and began to compose at the age of 12. Eventually, she delved into larger compositions, such as an overture to the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Johanne Luise Heiberg's birth in 1913. She maintained contact with the school long after she was grown. At Moltke's funeral in 1928, she played his elegy on the Frederik church organ. She played at numerous charity events before, during and after World War II, and for many family celebrations. She wrote music for festive events in the Danish and Swedish royal families, such as a tribute march to King Gustav V of Sweden, and a wedding waltz to the heir to the throne, princess Margrethe of Denmark. Moe grew up in a solid, bourgeois middle-class environment, and her older brothers supported her musical talent. One of them, Olaf Edward M., was a bookseller and publisher, and he made sure that several of her early compositions were printed. In addition, he created contacts for the American publisher Arthur P. Schmidt, who published several of her works, including Alpine Suite for Organ in 1929.  Career  Moe had a long career as an organist, pianist, singer and composer. Her force was melodic inventiveness and a superior improvisation talent. Furthermore, she had a beautiful mezzo-soprano voice. Her formal musical education was quite limited. She was given piano lessons as a child at Dagmar Wals√∏e CFE Horne's Institute of Music. Later, she received private lessons over the course of eighteen months with organist E. Thune. In 1915, she was afforded the opportunity to audition as an independent student by way of the organist's exam at the Music Academy. Graduating with honor, the examiners commended her skills at the organ. By 1930, Moe was very active as a composer and musician. She wrote well over 200 songs in this period. Genres included many marches, tangos, and in the style of the foxtrot. Her songs in the romantic style were melodic and ranged from the simple and intimate to the large-scale and partly through-composed. In 1933 she appeared for the first time in Danish radio, where she sang her own songs. She later performed for several broadcasts. Her only string quartet was composed in 1934. It was played in Vienna by an Austrian women's string quartet, led by violinist Anita Ast. In 1937 she had a commitment to Holberg Haven in National-Scala in Copenhagen. One reviewer in the National Journal wrote, \\"In the rise of the composer within Benna Moe, as with fine Music Sans and lady-like attitude, she directs her own compositions.\\" She continued to conduct many of her own pieces, namely in 1950, when she, while in Stockholm, led a military band that played her Orph√©e Marche. Moe's connection with Sweden was fully established in the 1930s. She had previously had several compositions presented on Swedish radio and at public concerts in Gothenburg and Helsingborg. In 1937 she made a program on Swedish radio with the cellist C. Coster which was very well received. She also sang at an orchestra concert in Ystad in 1938, where her \\"v√§lskolade mezzo-soprano\\" and \\"livfulla lecture\\" became famous. She made many friends in Sweden, including composer H. Alfv√©n, organist O. Olsson and painter Gerda H√∂glund. From 1941-48, she stayed in Sweden, where she gave several concerts, including a tour in 1944, in which she performed at concerts for 22 days in a row. She eventually settled in the town of Mora as a composer and music educator.  Personal life  Moe was unmarried and lived most of her adult life with her friend, a language teacher Karla Aagaard. Aagaard supported Moe in her travels. Moe's music has rarely been performed after her death, but recordings do exist on labels Tono and Musica at the Royal Library. There are amateur tape recordings from the 1950s and 1960s of her as a vocalist. Her last major performance was in Sweden, when she was 84 years old.

Later, she modelled lingerie and was a contestant on Miss TV Times (broadcast on UK television on 14 June 1974 and presented by Hughie Green).TV Times, 6 August 1974Miss TV Times 1974 cast, BFI.org.uk =In sex comedies= Mandel's acting career in British sex comedies began in 1976, with her first film, Intimate Games. Benny Hill saw Intimate Games, and this led him to cast Mandel on his eponymous show. She appears in multiple roles on two 1977 episodes of the series (broadcast in the UK 26 January 1977 and 23 March 1977). Of Hill and Jackie Wright's famous \\"head slapping\\" routine, she said \\"Jackie Wright was a chain smoker and he would often hide his cigarette in his mouth or behind his back during scenes. In fact, you could often see a little plume of smoke rising behind him if you looked close enough. Benny would slap his head to fan the smoke away.\\" On the big screen she quickly became a favourite of both British sex film directors and audiences. Soon she was receiving equal billing with Mary Millington, the UK's biggest sex symbol of the 1970s. Millington and Mandel's film, Come Play With Me still stands as one of the longest-running films in British film history, and ran continuously at the Moulin Cinema in London's West End from 1977 to 1981. =Performing in the US= After the release of her final British sex film, You're Driving Me Crazy, Mandel moved to Los Angeles where, in 1979, she attended the Lee Strasberg Institute for about a year, studying acting and voice. She also studied with noted voice and dialect coach Robert Easton. Mandel continued acting, appearing in the film The Mistress of the Apes (directed by B-film king Larry Buchanan). She appears in the 1980 film The Private Eyes starring Tim Conway and Don Knotts as Hilda, the Upstairs Maid. She guest starred on television shows like The Love Boat. She also appeared in the hardcore film Blonde Ambition (also known as Can I Come Again), which was shot in New York City in 1977, but only released in 1980. Blonde Ambition stars Mandel as Sugar Cane, half of a talentless duo of singers who become embroiled in the search for a missing brooch. Directed by the eccentric Amero Brothers, the role required Mandel to strip while ice skating, impersonate a drag queen, play the tuba and perform in hardcore sex scenes. (She used a body double for the last.) =Later years= Mandel eventually moved behind the scenes, working on the horror comedy Dead Men Don't Die (1991) starring Elliott Gould as well as co-producing Love Bites, starring Adam Ant, in 1993, (she appears briefly onscreen as well). In 1996, Mandel revealed in the British newspaper The People that she had quit show business to work as a nurse, caring for people dying from AIDS after several of her friends had died from the disease. For a short period of time, she ran an art gallery in Beverly Hills, California. However she returned to the nursing work, until 2001, when she was \\"involved in a very serious accident\\" which caused her to retire from that work. In 2006, she returned to producing, working with adult video director Jennifer James on a series, Inside Erotica. In 2014, Mandel appeared in the tongue-in-cheek British television documentary The Golden Rules of Porn (broadcast on More4 on 9 August 2014) discussing her roles in the soft-core British comedies Confessions of a Driving Instructor, Come Play with Me, The Playbirds and sharing her thoughts on bad chat-up lines and high heels. Personal life Mandel has been married more than once. On 16 August 1981, she married wealthy British film financier Stanley Margolis. Margolis had owned Tigon British Film Productions, the company that released some of her best-known British films, and that would later co-produce the 1993 film True Romance. She and Margolis divorced in 1994.  Filmography  *Health Farm (hardcore short 1975) ... 2nd Girl * Intimate Games (1976) ... Erica *Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976) ...

The FJ was the second model of an \\"all Australian car\\" manufactured by Holden and was based upon the established 48-215 series, commonly referred to as the \\"FX\\".  Overview  The FJ, of monocoque construction, broadly followed the silhouette of its predecessor, but featured a bolder horizontal styled front grille, along with comfort and decoration upgrades in a new sedan model named the 'Holden Special'. Originally specified as achieved at 3,800 rpm, the claimed maximum power output from the six-cylinder engine was increased to achieved at 4,000 rpm. The sedan, in Standard, Business and Special trim levels, and a coupe utility were announced in October 1953 and were followed by a Panel van derivative in December of that year.Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 225. A wagon prototype was built but the bodystyle was not put into production.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 67 In 1954, Holden's first exports began with sales of the FJ in New Zealand. In 1955 the car underwent a mild interior facelift for the Holden Special sedan, along with a variation in paint and trim options. The FJ series was progressively replaced by models from the Holden FE series from July 1956 to May 1957Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 228. with a total of 169,969 examples produced.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 67.

He was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers as a form of government identification. He was also the first Inuk to sit on what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories and worked with Thomas Berger. Early life Okpik, an Inuvialuit, was born January 12, 1928 in the Mackenzie Delta area of the Northwest Territories, near Aklavik at a summer fishing camp. Prior to selecting the name Abraham Okpik he was known as Auktalik, meaning man with a mole. He selected Abraham, a biblical reference, as his first name and Okpik, a name used in his family over several generations meaning willow, as his surname. Okpik learned English as a student at All Saints Indian Residential School in Aklavik. At the age of 16, Okpik contracted tuberculosis and was sent to the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton. He remained in the hospital for three years where he further improved his English, which eventually led to a job as a translator with the Distant Early Warning Line. Although he was permanently injured by his dog sled he was still able to hunt and trap. 1960s By the 1960s, Okpik was living in what was then called Frobisher Bay, now Iqaluit. He was working at Apex, the subdivision where most Inuit lived in the town's early days, at the rehabilitation centre. He was later to work for Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) as an administrator. In 1965 Okpik was appointed to the Northwest Territories Council (5th Northwest Territories Legislative Council). At that time most of the council were from Ottawa. Okpik's role on the council was to serve as a representative for the Inuit population resident in the eastern arctic. He attended his first council meeting on February 4, 1966. He began in his native language before transitioning to fluent English to advocate for a higher standard of living in the North arguing Inuit \\"must have a voice in development.\\" He was not re- appointed to council after Simonie Michael was elected to the council in 1966. The government of Canada felt that Michael would serve Okpik's intended role and gave his seat to Chief John Tetlichi, the first status Indian to serve on council. Project Surname Beginning the 1940s, the Government of Canada used \\"disc numbers\\", similar to dog tags, to identify people. They were deemed necessary to facilitate the distribution of family allowances due to the absence of surnames within Inuit communities and the frequency of name changes over the course of a person's life. In the mid-1960s the Northwest Territories Council undertook to replace the disc numbers with last names under Project Surname. Okpik, whose disc number was \\"W3-554\\", was picked to head the project. From 1968 until 1971 Okpik visited every community, as well as many traditional campsites, in the Northwest Territories and what is now Nunavut and Nunavik in northern Quebec. In total he visited 55 settlements, travelling by plane, snowmobile, boat and snowshoe. At each visit Okpik would record a person's name, explaining the necessity of having a first and last name. Pamela R. Stern points out that while it may have been expected that cultural naming practices be accommodated, \\"Okpik employed a standard Euro-Canadian naming pattern that assumed a nuclear family with a male head-of-household.\\" As a result, it was mostly men who selected a surname that was in turn extended to the whole family. At the end of the project Okpik returned home to his wife and three children in Frobisher Bay where he worked as a teacher at Frobisher Bay School. The Berger Commission In 1974, the Government of Canada commissioned Thomas Berger to head the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry. The inquiry lasted longer and travelled further than was expected, through 35 northern communities,Natives Speak Out and Okpik accompanied Berger as both an interpreter and broadcaster. Order of Canada In recognition of Okpik's work with the \\"Berger Commission\\", on the NWT Council and for \\"Project Surname\\" he was made a \\"Member of the Order of Canada\\". The appointment was made 15 December 1976 with the investiture 20 April 1977. Later life and death In 1979 he returned to Iqaluit but had spent time on Banks Island and in Spence Bay, now Taloyoak. Okpik spent the rest of his life in Iqaluit and was an elected member of the town council on several occasions. He also served on several volunteer organisations and committees. Okpik died in Iqaluit 10 July 1997 after an illness and his funeral service was held in St. Jude's Cathedral 15 July. The \\"Abe Okpik Hall\\" in Apex is named for him. The former mayor of Iqaluit, Jimmy Kilabuk, had a mural painted on the side of his home in 1998 that included Okpik.

It then starts up again north of the station on Hunter Street East, where it then becomes a one-way street going north just past Barton Street East to Murray Street where it's cut off again by a parking lot for LIUNA Station. It then starts up again one block north past the CN railway tracks on Strachan Street and from this point onwards becomes a two-way street again that extends to the city's North End to the waterfront on Guise Street West, the site of the Canada Marine Discovery Centre and Pier 9. History Pier 8, Hamilton Waterfront Trail, Art Sculpture Pier 8, Hamilton Waterfront Trail, Restaurant Hughson Street was named after Nathaniel Hughson (1755‚Äì1837), a farmer and hotel owner. Hughson was a Loyalist who moved to Canada following the American Revolution, one of the city founders. Other streets in the city were named after his family members: James Street (son), Rebecca Street (wife) and Catharine Street (daughter). The Sir John A. Macdonald Statue at Gore Park arrived in Hamilton from London, England on 30 October 1893. Official dedication of the statue took place 1 November 1893. Originally, the statue was located at the intersection of King and Hughson Streets and pointed West. Prime Minister Sir John Thompson was in attendance. Alexander Aitchison, a local Hamilton Fire Chief, died of injuries he sustained from crashing into the base of the statue with his horse and buggy and because of it, the statue was then relocated to Gore Park near King and John Streets only this time the statue instead of pointing West, now points East.

It comprises two suites composed in 2003 by Frith \\"for flute, bassoon, gu zheng, percussion, violin and electronics\\" and was recorded in 2003 and 2004. Background The two suites on the album, \\"Imitation\\" and \\"The Happy End Problem\\" were composed by Frith for small ensembles of six and seven musicians. They were originally commissioned in 2003 by choreographer Amanda Miller for two dances for her The Pretty Ugly Dance Company. Both suites premiered at the Stadttheater in Freiburg, Germany, \\"The Happy End Problem\\" in May 2003 and \\"Imitation\\" in April 2004. In \\"The Happy End Problem\\" Frith drew on elements from Igor Stravinsky's 1910 ballet, Firebird Suite. \\"Imitation\\" focused on Oriental elements and played on the Western world's perception of Japan. At the time, the shakuhachi player, Kikutsubo Day was a student of Frith's at Mills College in the United States, and he constructed \\"Imitation\\" around her playing.

PIE roots usually have verbal meaning like \\"to eat\\" or \\"to run\\". Roots never occur alone in the language. Complete inflected verbs, but also nouns and adjectives are formed by adding further morphemes to a root and by changing the root's vowel in a process called ablaut. A root consists of a central vowel that is preceded and followed by at least one consonant each. A number of rules have been determined that specify which consonants can occur together, and in which order. Basically, the consonants with the highest sonority ('The asterisk * indicates that a form is not directly attested, but has been reconstructed on the basis of other linguistic material.) are nearest to the vowel, and the ones with the lowest sonority such as plosives are furthest away, notwithstanding certain exceptions such as thorn clusters. Sometimes new roots were created in PIE or its early descendants by various processes such as root extensions (adding a sound to the end of an existing root) or metathesis. Word formation Typically, a root plus a suffix forms a stem, and adding an ending forms a word. \\\\underbrace{\\\\underbrace{\\\\mathrm{root+suffix}}_{\\\\mathrm{stem}} + \\\\mathrm{ending}}_{\\\\mathrm{word}} For example, ' \\"he bears\\" can be split into the root \\"to bear\\", the suffix ' \\"imperfective aspect\\" and the ending ' \\"present tense, third person singular\\".Examples of PIE roots are taken from and . The suffix is sometimes missing, which has been interpreted as a zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns. An example is \\"I am\\". Beyond this basic structure, there is the nasal infix which functions as a present tense marker, and reduplication, a prefix with a number of grammatical and derivational functions. =Finite verbs= Verbal suffixes, including the zero suffix, convey grammatical information about tense and aspect, two grammatical categories that are not clearly distinguished. Imperfective (present, durative) and perfective aspect (aorist, punctual) are universally recognised, while some of the other aspects remain controversial. Two of the four moods, the subjunctive and the optative, are also formed with suffixes, which sometimes results in forms with two consecutive suffixes: ' > ' \\"he would bear\\", with the first ' being the present tense marker, and the second the subjunctive marker. Reduplication can mark the present and the perfect. Verbal endings convey information about grammatical person, number and voice. The imperative mood has its own set of endings. =Nouns and adjectives= Nouns usually derive from roots or verb stems by suffixation or by other means. (See the morphology of the Proto-Indo-European noun for some examples.) This can hold even for roots that are often translated as nouns: , for example, can mean \\"to tread\\" or \\"foot\\", depending on the ablaut grade and ending. Some noun stems like ' \\"lamb\\", however, do not derive from known verbal roots. In any case, the meaning of a noun is given by its stem, whether this is composed of a root plus a suffix or not. This leaves the ending, which conveys case and number. Adjectives are also derived by suffixation of (usually verbal) roots. An example is \\"begotten, produced\\" from the root \\"to beget, to produce\\". The endings are the same as with nouns. =Infinitives and participles= Infinitives are verbal nouns and, just like other nouns, are formed with suffixes. It is not clear whether any of the infinitive suffixes reconstructed from the daughter languages (', ', ', among others) was actually used to express an infinitive in PIE. Participles are verbal adjectives formed with the suffixes ' (active imperfective and aorist participle), ' (perfect participle) and ' or ' (mediopassive participle), among others. Shape of a root In its base form, a PIE root consists of a single vowel, preceded and followed by consonants. Except for a very few cases, the root is fully characterized by its consonants, while the vowel may change in accordance with inflection or word derivation. Thus, the root ' can also appear as ', with a long vowel as ' or ', or even unsyllabic as ', in different grammatical contexts. This process is called ablaut, and the different forms are called ablaut grades. The five ablaut grades are the e-grade, o-grade, lengthended e- and o-grades, and the zero-grade that lacks a vowel. In linguistic works, ' is used to stand in for the various ablaut grades that the vowel may appear in. Some reconstructions also include roots with ' as the vowel, but the existence of ' as a distinct vowel is disputed; see Indo-European ablaut: a-grade. The vowel is flanked on both sides by one or more consonants; the preceding consonants are the onset, the following ones are the coda. The onset and coda must contain at least one consonant; a root may not begin or end with the ablaut vowel. Consequently, the simplest roots have an onset and coda consisting of one consonant each. Such simple roots are common; examples are: \\"to give\\", ' \\"to bear\\", \\"to put\\", \\"to run\\", \\"to eat\\", \\"sharp\\", ' \\"to tread\\", \\"to sit\\", and \\"to clothe\\". Roots can also have a more complex onset and coda, consisting of a consonant cluster (multiple consonants). These include: \\"to breathe\\", \\"red\\", \\"to plough\\", \\"straight\\", \\"to bind\\", \\"to freeze\\", \\"to flow\\", \\"to sleep\\", and \\"to moisten\\". The maximum number of consonants seems to be five, as in \\"to twine\\". Early PIE scholars reconstructed a number of roots beginning or ending with a vowel. The latter type always had a long vowel (' \\"to put\\", ' \\"to grow\\", ' \\"to give\\"), while this restriction did not hold for vowel-initial roots (' \\"to eat\\", ' \\"to drive\\", ' \\"to smell\\"). Laryngeal theory can explain this behaviour by reconstructing a laryngeal following the vowel (', , ', resulting in a long vowel) or preceding it (', , , resulting in a short vowel). These reconstructions obey the mentioned rules. =Sonority hierarchy= When the onset or coda of a root contains a consonant cluster, the consonants in this cluster must be ordered according to their sonority. The vowel constitutes a sonority peak, and the sonority must progressively rise in the onset and progressively fall in the coda. PIE roots distinguish three main classes of consonants, arranged from high to low sonority: # Non- labial sonorants ', denoted collectively as '. # Labial sonorants ', denoted collectively as '. # Obstruents, denoted collectively as '. These include three subgroups: #* Plosives (voiceless ', voiced ' and aspirated '), denoted collectively as '. #* The sibilant '. #* The laryngeals ', denoted collectively as '. The following rules apply: * A consonant closer to the main vowel must have a higher sonority than the consonant further away. Thus, consonants in the onset must follow the order ', and the reverse ' in the coda, giving ' as the full root shape. Roots with a different order of sonority, like ' or ', are not allowed. * Only one member of each sonority class may appear in the onset or coda. Thus, roots like ', ' or ' are not allowed. Laryngeals can also occur in the coda before a sonorant, as in \\"small\\". =Obstruent clusters= The obstruent slot of an onset or coda may consist of multiple obstruents itself. Here, too, only one member of each subgroup of obstruents may appear in the cluster; a cluster may not contain multiple laryngeals or plosives. The rules for the ordering within a cluster of obstruents are somewhat different, and do not fit into the general sonority hierarchy: * Only voiceless plosives occur when preceded by ' in the onset. * A laryngeal may appear before or after any obstruent other than another laryngeal. Examples are \\"to grab\\", \\"to fly\\", \\"to dry\\", ' \\"to pour, rain\\", ' \\"to awake\\", and ' \\"to be silent\\". In several roots, a phenomenon called s-mobile occurs, where some descendants include a prepended ' while other forms lack it. There does not appear to be any particular pattern; sometimes forms with ' and without it even occur side by side in the same language. =Further restrictions= PIE abided by the general cross-linguistic constraint against the co-occurrence of two similar consonants in a word root. In particular, no examples are known of roots containing two plain voiced plosives (') or two glides ('). A few examples of roots with two fricatives or two nasals ( \\"to burn\\", \\"to give, to take\\" etc.) can be reconstructed, but they were rare as well. An exception, however, were the voiced aspirated and voiceless plosives, which relatively commonly co-occurred (e.g. \\"to burn\\", ' \\"to fly\\"). In particular, roots with two voiced aspirates were more than twice as common than could be expected to occur by chance. An additional constraint prohibited roots containing both a voiced aspirated and a voiceless plosive ('), unless the latter occurs in a word-initial cluster after an ' (e.g. \\"to stiffen\\"). Taken together with the abundance of '-type roots, it has been proposed that this distribution results from a limited process of voice assimilation in pre-PIE, where a voiceless stop was assimilated to a voiced aspirate, if another one followed or preceded within a root. =Exceptions= Thorn clusters are sequences of a dental (') plus a velar plosive (' etc.). Their role in PIE phonotactics is unknown. Roots like \\"to perish\\" apparently violate the phonotactical rules, but are quite common. Some roots cannot be reconstructed with an ablauting ', an example being ' \\"to grow, to become\\". Such roots can be seen as generalized zero grades of unattested forms like ', and thus follow the phonotactical rules. Some roots like ' \\"to sneeze\\" or ' \\"to duck\\" do not appear to follow these rules. This might be due to incomplete understanding of PIE phonotactics or to wrong reconstructions. ', for example, might not have existed in PIE at all, if the Indo-European words usually traced back to it are onomatopoeias. Lexical meaning The meaning of a reconstructed root is conventionally that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from a limited number of so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut. Nevertheless, some roots did exist that did not have a primary verbal derivation. Apart from the aforementioned root nouns, the most important of these were the so-called Caland roots, which had adjectival meaning. Such roots generally formed proterokinetic adjectives with the suffix ', thematic adjectives in ' and compounding stems in '. They included at least ' \\"red\\", \\"white\\", \\"deep\\" and \\"heavy\\". Verbal roots were inherently either imperfective or perfective. To form a verb from the root's own aspect, verb endings were attached directly to the root, either with or without a thematic vowel. The \\"other\\" aspect, if it was needed, would then be a so-called \\"characterised\\" stem, as detailed in Proto-Indo-European verb. The characterised imperfective stems are often different in different descendants, but with no association between certain forms and the various branches of Indo-European, which suggests that a number of aspects fell together before PIE split up. Creation of new roots Roots were occasionally created anew within PIE or its early descendants. A variety of methods have been observed. =Root extensions= Root extensions are additions of one or two sounds, often plosives, to the end of a root. These extensions do not seem to change the meaning of a root, and often lead to variant root forms across different descendants. The source and function of these extensions is not known. For ' 'to push, hit, thrust', we can reconstruct: * ' > Ancient Greek œÑœçŒ∫ŒøœÇ (t√∫kos) \\"hammer\\" * ' > Russian —Å—Ç—ÉŒ∫ (stuk) and —Å—Ç—ÉÃÅŒ∫–∞—Ç—å (st√∫kat¬¥) \\"knock\\" and \\"to knock\\" * ' > English stoke (Germanic k goes back to PIE '.) * ' > Vedic tud√°ti \\"beats\\" =Sonorant metathesis= When the root contains a sonorant, the zero grade is ambiguous as to whether the sonorant should be placed before the ablaut vowel or after it. Speakers occasionally analysed such roots the \\"wrong\\" way, and this has led to some roots being created from existing ones by swapping the position of the sonorant. An example of such a pair of roots, both meaning \\"to increase, to enlarge\\": * > Gothic wahsjan \\"to grow\\", Ancient Greek Œ±·ΩîŒæœâ (a√∫x≈ç) \\"to increase\\". * > Gothic aukan \\"to increase, to grow\\", Latin auge≈ç \\"to increase\\", Lithuanian √°ugti \\"to grow\\". Another example concerns the root \\"sky\\", which formed a v·πõddhi derivative in this way: * > Ancient Greek ŒñŒµœçœÇ (Ze√∫s), Latin diƒìs \\"day\\", Sanskrit dy√∫ \\"sky, day\\". * > Latin dƒ´vus \\"divine\\", Old Prussian deiwis, Sanskrit dev√° \\"deity\\". =Back- formations= Sometimes, commonly used words became the template for a new root that was back-formed from the word, different from the root from which the word was originally formed. For example, the ablauting noun \\"lifetime\\" was formed as a u-stem derivative of the root . The oblique stem alternant ' was then reinterpreted as the e-grade of a new root, which formed a new neuter s-stem , a formation which is only created from roots.

Definition Cong (/) is a Chinese word (noun quantifier) meaning clump, thicket, bush, and/or shrubbery. The word is also a measure word for flowers however has been informally used for a group of people or things. Background Cong surname is the name of a relatively small population of Chinese. Not to be confused with other \\"Cong/Cungs\\", e.g. in Vietnamese. The surname is said to be from a group of people in Wendeng (ÊñáÁôª) in China's Shandong province. Residents with this surname can also be found In Japan, Korea, Mongolia and other Asian countries. Historical origins The Congs are originally of Xiongnu origin. They trace their ancestry to King Xiutu of the Xiongnu. In 121 BC, Xiongnu King Hunxie killed King Xiutu when Xiutu refused to surrender to the Chinese with Hunxie. The fourteen-year-old Crown Prince Midi was taken to China and raised as a stable hand. One day, when Emperor Wu of Han was inspecting the horses with his wives, all the servants were mesmerized by the royal entourage, except for Midi. Emperor Wu of Han took favor of the prince and granted him the Chinese surname Jin, meaning gold, because the prince used to make sacrifices with golden statues as a part of the Xiongnu rituals. Jin Midi and his descendants later rose to prominent positions in the Han court. However, due to dynastic changes, the descendants of Jin Midi were persecuted for their royalist ties to the Han Dynasty. The Jins escaped and after over forty years of wandering, they eventually arrived at Cong Hill in Buye, modern day Wendeng, Shandong Province, and changed their surname to Cong. Rank Cong is ranked as the 127th most popular Chinese surname. The population with the surname Cong tend to be more concentrated in the northern regions of China. People with the last name Cong accounts for about 0.1% of Han population.

It was formerly a community school that was established in 1956 and converted to an academy in June 2012. It adopted its present name in September 2019 and is part of the Greenshaw Learning Trust.  History  Logo of Henbury School. Henbury School was a community school that was established in 1956 as one of the first purpose-built comprehensive schools in the country. It was completely rebuilt under a ¬£17.3 million private finance initiative in 2005 where a financial agreement was made in April 2004 between Bristol City Council and Bristol Schools Ltd; a company set up by HBG Construction Ltd to oversee the construction and management of the school for 26 years, including three other schools that were also being rebuilt, after which it will become the property of the local education authority. The features of the new building include a sports hall, all-weather pitch, swimming pool, fitness suite, dance studio and coffee bar. It was used as a filming location for the Roundview College in the television series Skins and its American-style yellow school bus service was discontinued by Bristol City Council after December 2005 following a two-year pilot, due to it not being cost effective and students were already using sustainable transport. The service was launched in June 2003 as a joint initiative between the council and FirstGroup with an aim to reduce traffic congestion and improve child safety. Image of the rebuilt Henbury School. It has been involved in the Rugby Football Union's All Schools programme since 2012 and is linked with Clifton Rugby Football Club. England announced their 2019 Rugby World Cup squad at the school on 12 August 2019, and its students who were involved in rugby programmes and Clifton took part in rugby sessions with the players and coaches. It converted to an academy in June 2012. It was rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted following its inspection in November 2018 and the governing body subsequently began looking into the future of the school and evaluating its options. It agreed unanimously that it believed the best way forward was to join the Greenshaw Learning Trust and was confirmed in March 2019 following consultation with parents and other stakeholders. The trust had also been providing support to the school since the start of the year and Katherine Brown was appointed as the new headteacher from September 2019. It joined the trust and renamed to Blaise High School in September 2019 with a new logo and uniform as part of its \\"journey of improvement to ensure it provides the best possible learning environment for all of its students\\". The name was selected after receiving the highest number of preferences in a survey and reflects its place in the local community with it being close to the Blaise Castle Estate. The new logo retains the school colours of green and black with a castle design representing Blaise Castle on a traditional heraldic badge shape. The new uniform was devised in discussion with the school community and subsidised by the trust.

Biography =Youth= Glass was born in Orpington, Kent. She was the oldest of three daughters born to John Pomeroy Glass and Edith Mary Muirhead. Her father, was a senior partner and later chairman of James Templeton & Co, then one of the leading makers of carpets in Britain. After her schooling Glass studied art at Chelsea Polytechnic in London. One of her teachers was neo-Romantic English painter, Graham Sutherland. At this time she was influenced by Sutherland as well as Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. =Career= During the war Glass joined the Women's Royal Naval Service and worked in military censorship. After her marriage, she became known as Joan Clifford-Smith but continued to sign her work under her maiden name (Joan Glass). She is best known for her textile designs and one of her carpet designs became one of the biggest selling commercial carpets available in Britain during the 1950s and 60s. In 1952 she moved to Buck‚Äôs House in Great Bardfield, Essex. While in Great Bardfield, Glass and her husband became friendly with the village art community known as the Great Bardfield Artists. They organised a series of large open house exhibitions during the 1950s, which attracted thousands of visitors. Glass exhibited textiles and pictures at all these shows. Known for her fine sense of colour her textiles and paintings were mainly semi-abstract in design. Some of her work is included in the collection of the Fry Art Gallery in Saffron Walden, Essex. The Bardfield art community fragmented in the early 1960s and Glass and her family (which now included four sons) briefly moved to London before relocating to (15th century) Little Baddow Hall, near Chelmsford, Essex. During this time the artist‚Äôs output was restricted to making and decorating ceramics, Following the example of the earlier Bardfield summer exhibitions, Glass established in 1971 a series of large summer art festivals at her Essex home. These were very popular with the local art community and in 1974 she converted her house and established the Little Baddow Hall Arts Centre. Musicians and artists attracted to the centre included Howard Shelly, the Medici Quartet, John Miller and Andy Warhol, as well as prominent local artists Geoffrey Burnand, John Doubleday and Humphrey Spender. According to her obituary, the Arts Centre‚Äôs ‚Äòenormous popularity was due in no part to Joan‚Äôs own stamp of style and sophistication, combined with a welcoming lack of pretension.' Despite its popularity with the mid Essex art community, the arts centre closed in 1979 and in 1990 she moved to a smaller house in Little Baddow. Personal life During the Second World War, she served in the navy where she met artist Stanley Clifford-Smith and they married shortly after the end of the war. The couple moved to Suffolk in East Anglia where they both painted and designed fabrics. After the death of her husband she abandoned art practice for the role of art patron. Death Joan Glass died in an Essex nursing home in 2000.

There are over a thousand units, ranging over a million square feet, that was able to accommodate over 2,800 athletes, coaches, and officials for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The site, a former industrial area which mostly consisted of parking lots, is located on the shoreline at the southeast corner of False Creek, north of Second Avenue between Quebec and Manitoba Streets. Just south of Science World, its waterfront is part of the False Creek Seawall promenade and bike route, and is adjacent to the stations of the Granville Island Heritage Railway, the Spyglass Place pedestrian ferry wharf (served by Aquabus and False Creek Ferries), the Science World pedestrian ferry wharf (normally served by Aquabus and False Creek Ferries but closed temporarily from 25 January 2010 to 24 March 2010\\"Olympics to close three waterways to boat traffic\\" , Vancouver Sun, 30 April 2009) and the Main Street and Olympic Village SkyTrain stations. Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village The Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village (WVL) is located in Whistler, British Columbia, it served the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Smaller than the VVL, it accommodated 2,400 athletes, coaches, and officials with 450 beds made especially with wheelchair access. Site preparation began in 2006 with construction starting in March 2007 and it was completed in Summer 2009. About The site has 252 affordable housing units and another 100 units are for \\"modest market housing\\". Southeast False Creek is the designation given to the neighbourhood the Olympic Village resides in, bordered by Cambie, Main, West 2nd Avenue, and False Creek. The City of Vancouver projects that Southeast False Creek will eventually become home to up to 16,000 people by 2020. The site currently boasts a 45,000 square foot community centre, named the Creekside Community Recreation Centre.

Construction was completed on 1 November 2009 by the Millennium Development Group, and turned over to the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) for use during the Winter Games. On 7 April 2010 it was returned to the City of Vancouver. The village was converted into residential housing, a community centre, daycare, retail, and service spaces. Residents released video documenting major problems with their units, including water pouring out of light fixtures, heat not working, cracks in ceilings, hardwood floors bubbling from moisture and bedrooms too small to fit a bed. More than 60 condo owners at the Village filed a class-action lawsuit against the builder. The lawsuits were subsequently dropped. On December 12, 2014, the City of Vancouver unveiled a plaque honouring Millennium Development Group's role in designing, developing and constructing the Olympic Village, named \\"Millennium Water Olympic Village\\". The wording on the plaque states: > \\"North America's first LEED Platinum community was designed, developed and > constructed by Peter and Shahram Malek's Millennium Development Group in > time to open as the athletes' village for the successful Vancouver 2010 > Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

On January 18, 2009, an emergency meeting convened by the BC Legislature approved Bill 47, allowing the City of Vancouver unlimited access to additional funds for the development of the Olympic Village. The estimated new total cost is CAN$1 billion to build VVL, approximately CAN$ 467 million dollars were required by the City of Vancouver to complete the project. The project ran into financial woes late last year as well as the lender, Fortress Investment Group, a New York hedge fund, stopped payments to the village's holding company, SEFC Properties Ltd. Bill 47 is an unusual amendment to the charter for the Olympics in that it changes the original requirement that all additional borrowing is prohibited without a public referendum, and also that it was until this legislation was passed that it was illegal for the City of Vancouver to pursue such financial dealings. The city, in order to meet its Olympics commitments, required extraordinary legislative proceedings to amend the city's charter to allow it to borrow to buy out the loan from Fortress.Speech by Corky Evans in the BC Legislature, Thursday, 29 January 2009, from BC Hansard, Legislature Raids/Basi-Virk Trial webpage] In November 2010, seven months after the successful completion of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the village's holding company and the City of Vancouver agreed to place the property into voluntary receivership.The Economist, \\"Up False Creek: The cost of a property deal gone sour\\", 15 January 2011, p. 40.

The Australian deputy prime minister at the time Julia Gillard called the request for the banner's removal a disgrace. According to a representative of the Australian team, the flag has been at every Olympic Village since the 2000 Games in Sydney. The image had flown from the victorious Australian yacht in the 1983 America's Cup and is now a mascot of Australia's Olympic teams; the Australian Olympic Committee owns the image's trademark. After IOC president Jacques Rogge discussed the issue with John Coates, chief of the AOC, it was confirmed that the flag could remain at the Olympic Village. \\"While the IOC is of the view that the display of the boxing kangaroo at the Olympic village is a breach of the IOC rules relating to clean venues, the IOC is not going to request us to take down the boxing kangaroo flag on this occasion,\\" Coates said. The AOC was required to register the image with the IOC. The controversy sparked a demand for a version of the boxing-kangaroo flag at a Vancouver flag shop.

It is a simple and effective method of ensuring synchronization between sound and picture in a video or film. A 2-pop is typically placed at the end of a visual countdown. Only the first frame of the \\"2\\" is shown, and the remainder of the 2 seconds prior to the program is black. This provides a unique point of reference where the frame-long image and frame-long sound should align, similar to the way a film clapperboard is used to generate a synchronization point. For example, in a television or video program the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at one hour (typically timecode of 01:00:00:00 in the US, and 10:00:00:00 in the UK), preceding that, 1 frame (or the 2-pop) of tone would be placed at timecode 00:59:58:00 or exactly 2 seconds before first picture. Alternately, in film post-production the leader starts at 01:00:00:00 (or 0+00 feet if using feet and frames as is common in the United States), the 2-pop starts at 01:00:06:00 (or 9+00), and the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at 01:00:08:00 (or 12+00). A 2-pop is useful whenever picture and sound are handled separately. For example, projecting work-in- progress in the pre-video days involved a film projector linked to a magnetic dubber, onto which the separate soundtrack reel was loaded. Aligning them by the 2-pop would ensure proper synchronization during playback. A modern scenario would involve sending a soundtrack to a separate facility for a sound mix. The returned product is a computer audio file which then needs to be synchronized again with the picture.  Sample sound  Whereas laying down bars and tone prior to program start establishes video and audio calibration levels on the tape, the 2-pop is primarily used for picture and sound synchronization. Therefore, while the loudness of the 2-pop may be the same as the bars and tone audio level in use, this is not a requirement. The loudness level should be sufficient to be heard clearly.

He spent 10 years in North Carolina as a child between 1874 and 1884. After the death of his father, the family returned to Denmark. In 1889, he began a course of study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, which he completed in 1893. Career From May to November 1898, he participated in a geological expedition headed by K. J. V. Steenstrup (1842-1906) to the Disko Bay region at the west coast of Greenland. From this expedition Moltke made paintings of geological structures, a.o., the coast line of Nugsuark Peninsula, and of the Inuit, a.o., \\"Greenland women in umiak\\". During July 1899 to April 1900, Moltke joined an aurora expedition to Akureyri in Iceland. Stauning, P.,(2011): \\"Danish auroral science history\\" Hist. Geo Space Sci., 2, 1-28, 2011, doi:10.5194/hgss-2-1-2011 . The expedition was arranged and headed by the director, Adam F. W. Paulsen (1833-1907), of the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). Further participants were Dan Barfod la Cour (1876-1942), director of DMI 1923-1942, and Ivar B. Jantzen (1875-1961). In Akureyri, Moltke made 19 paintings of auroras and 5 portrait sketches of the expedition members. In the winter 1900-1901, Moltke participated in another DMI aurora expedition; this time to Utsjoki in northern Finland. This expedition was headed by Dan B. la Cour. Further participants were Carl Edvard Thune Middelboe (1875-1924) and Johannes K. Kofoed (1877-1939). Here, Moltke made, a.o., 6 paintings of auroras. The aurora paintings from the two aurora expedition belong to and reside now with the Danish Meteorological Institute. During 1902-1904, Harald Moltke joined The Literature Expedition (Den Litter√¶re Ekspedition), headed by Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen (1872-1907), with Knud Rasmussen (1879‚Äì1933), J√∏rgen Br√∏nlund (1877‚Äì1907) and Alfred Bertelsen (1877-1950). The expedition was a dog sled journey along the unmapped north- west coast of Greenland from Upernavik to Cape York close to Thule. From this expedition his main works are a set of 30 portraits of Inuit, issued in 1903. He also illustrated the book Gr√∏nland, illustreret Skildring af Den Danske litter√¶re Gr√∏nlandsekspedition 1902-1904 (1906) with Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen as author. From 1907-08, he was employed at the Royal Copenhagen porcelain factory and from 1908-14 for the porcelain factory Bing & Grondahl. During the later years of his life, Moltke made numerous paintings, particularly portraits and landscapes, and published his memoirs in two volumes: Livsrejsen (1936) and Den lykkelige Rejse (1941). His works are on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and at museums in Hiller√∏d and Helsing√∏r.

It was originally purified from pig spinal cord, and later shown to be present in human central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.  Sequence  The sequence of the C-terminal decapeptide is highly conserved across mammalian species: GNLWATGHFM-(NH2); this decapeptide is sometimes noted as neuromedin B, but it is more accurately described as neuromedin B 23-32. The sequence of neuromedin B (in rat) is : TPFSWDLPEPRSRASKIRVHPRGNLWATGHFM-(NH2).  Function  Figure 1: NMB, 7-TMR receptor and G-protein Figure 2 : Signal Cascade after NMB binding Neuromedin regulates the following functions: * exocrine and endocrine secretions * cell growth * body temperature * blood pressure and glucose level  Neuromedin signaling pathway  NMB acts by binding to its high affinity cell surface receptor, neuromedin B receptor (NMBR). This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane spanning regions, hence the receptor is also denoted as a 7-transmembrane receptor (7-TMR). Upon binding several intracellular signaling pathways are triggered (see Figure 2). When NMB binds to its 7-TMR, the heterotrimeric G protein that is attached to the receptor is activated. The G-protein is called heterotrimeric because it consists of 3 polypeptides: Œ± subunit, Œ≤ subunit, and Œ≥ subunit. In the activated NMBR/G-protein complex, there occurs an exchange of GTP for GDP bound to G-Œ± subunit. The G-Œ± subunit, in turn, dissociated form the G-Œ≤Œ≥ subunits. The free G-Œ± inactivates adenylate cyclase (AC), which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, the latter of which functioning as a second messenger. cAMP activates of the enzyme Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA enters the nucleus and activates the cAMP response element-binding protein. The activated CREB binds along with CREB binding protein, co-activator to the CRE region of the DNA in the nucleus. CREB and CBP are held together by leucine zippers. CRE is the control that activates number of growth factors, and thus cell proliferation and some anti-apoptotic genes. In the brain, CREB plays a role in long-term memory and learning.

As they try to work out the mystery of the village, and its connection to the ship, they find out that the village has other problems - fog and monsters surround them at every turn, and their children have been going missing. Plot The Doctor and Martha arrive on the Castor, an abandoned prison ship floating in space. Whilst exploring they find a fully populated village and forest, whose inhabitants appear to be unaware of the spaceship outside, and whose children are mysteriously disappearing. Later, The Doctor and Martha find a creature from another dimension, who, because of its telepathic powers, was used to remove the evil from prisoners in the Castor. To keep itself sane, it expelled the evil, creating a separate being which killed the crew. The telepathic creature then created the forest and village in an attempt to balance itself with goodness, but, due to low power supplies, it is having to remove small parts of the 'program', such as children, to conserve power. The Doctor offers to pilot the ship closer to a sun to give the creature more power to run the program, and a woman from the village absorbs the evil into her body, before exiling herself, so she can learn to control it.

The two frigates were launched in August 1797 under the names Carr√®re and Muiron, and completed during November by the orders of Pierre-Alexandre Forfait.

His dates of birth and death are unknown, but he was active from 1162 until 1189. Early life He was probably born in Bosham, Sussex, from which he took his name. He studied theology in Paris as a pupil of Peter Lombard.Frank Barlow, Thomas Becket (1986), p. 7. He introduced Lombard's Sentences into England.Roger Bradshaigh Lloyd, The Golden Middle Age (1939), p. 127. Companion to Becket He must have joined Becket's household before 1162 as, on his elevation in that year, the new archbishop immediately promoted him to a responsible position. He was to give his master advice on the performance of his duties, and to assist and even direct his studies of Scripture. Herbert remained closely attached to Becket throughout the arduous and troubled years of his episcopacy and exile until almost the very eve of the final scene in Canterbury Cathedral. Having returned to England with Becket in December 1170, he remained with him until sent back again on an errand to the French king; vainly he implored his master to let him stay for the end which both felt to be close at hand, and which in fact came two days after his departure. Of all the archbishop's followers he was the keenest antagonist of the king Henry II of England and the royal \\"customs\\", quite ready on occasion to beard the king to his face or to undertake dangerous missions to England. Biographer After Becket's death Herbert seems to have lived mainly on the Continent, not revisiting England until about 1184, and he complains that he was neglected; he records, however, a friendly interview with the king himself. We know nothing of him after the year 1189. Herbert of Bosham's verbose biography of Becket has less historical value of than that of William Fitzstephen. He shared Thomas's ideals and was an eyewitness of most of the incidents of his episcopacy. He had sat by him, for instance, during the stormy scenes of the trial at Northampton. On the other hand, he did not begin to write till 1184, many years after the events which he records, and Dom Albert L'Huillier gave reasons to doubt the accuracy of Herbert's reminiscences. Besides the Life of St. Thomas, he wrote a lengthy Liber Melorum in praise of him. An edition of the Life is contained in vol. III of the Materials for the History of Thomas Becket (Rolls Series) edited by James Craigie Robertson; the volume also contains some extracts from the Liber Melorum. Fictional portrayals Herbert was portrayed by actor Clive Currie in the 1923 silent film Becket, based on a play by Alfred Lord Tennyson. Notes References *Introduction to vol.

While leading German forces in occupied Crete in April 1944, he was abducted by British SOE officers Patrick Leigh Fermor and William Stanley Moss, with the support of the Cretan resistance. Career Born in 1895, the thirteenth child of a Lutheran pastor from Hanover. He fought in World War I, seeing action at the Battle of Verdun where he won an Iron Cross First Class. After the war, he joined the Freikorps, and then the new Reichswehr in October 1919. By 1939, Kreipe had attained the rank of colonel in the Wehrmacht. =World War II= As commander of Infantry Regiment 909 of the 58th Infantry Division, Kreipe participated in the Battle of France and the drive towards Leningrad and fighting in Kuban during Operation Barbarossa. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 13 October 1941. Kreipe remained on the Leningrad front until May 1942, when he was transferred back to Germany, where he took up administrative and teaching positions. In June‚ÄìOctober 1943, he was returned to the Eastern Front, where he led the 79th Infantry Division. On 1 March 1944, Kreipe was appointed Commander of the 22nd Air Landing Infantry Division, operating on Crete, replacing General Friedrich-Wilhelm M√ºller, who had been made the German commander of Crete in Chania. =Abduction by Greek and British agents= In the spring of 1944 the Allies hatched a plan to kidnap General M√ºller, whose harsh repressive measures had earned him the nickname \\"the Butcher of Crete\\". Major Patrick Leigh Fermor led the planned operation, assisted by Captain Bill Stanley Moss, Greek SOE agents and Cretan resistance fighters. However General M√ºller left the island before the plan could be executed. Major Leigh Fermor decided to abduct Kreipe instead. upright On the night of 26 April 1944 General Kreipe left headquarters in Archanes. The car headed without escort to a well-guarded residence, \\"Villa Ariadni\\", about 5 km outside Heraklion. Major Leigh Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him 1 km before his residence. When he arrived, they asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Leigh Fermor opened Kreipe's door, jumped in, and threatened him with his pistol, while Moss took the driver's seat. (The abduction is now commemorated near Archanes.) Moss drove the kidnappers and the General for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road-blocks in Heraklion, before leaving Leigh Fermor to drive on and abandon the car, with material being planted that suggested their escape from the island had been made by submarine. Moss set off with the General on a cross-country march, supported by the Greek resistance, soon rejoined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the kidnappers crossed the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British Motor Launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was waiting to rendez-vous. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino and ferried to Egypt. Kreipe was interrogated, then sent to a POW camp in Canada. Later transferred to a special camp in Wales,Brett Exton, Generalmajor Karl Heinrich Georg Ferdinand Kreipe, Some of the Prisoners Held at Special Camp 11, A link from the website ISLAND FARM PRISONER OF WAR CAMP: 198 / Special Camp: XI, Bridgend, South Wales , 2004. Kreipe was finally released from British captivity in 1947. General Kreipe met his kidnappers one more time in 1972 on a Greek television programme. Nikos Mastorakis, \\"The abduction of general Kreipe\\" He died at Northeim on 14 June 1976. In popular culture In 1950 W. Stanley Moss, one of the leaders of the operation, wrote a bestselling account of the abduction ‚Äî Ill Met by Moonlight.

They would conduct local reconnaissance, signpost the beaches, control boat traffic, and communicate with the maritime forces. These were known as Royal Australian Navy Beach Commandos. They took part in the Borneo campaign. Training An Amphibious Training Centre was commissioned as HMAS Assault at Port Stephens on 1 September 1942. The Amphibious Training Centre was commanded by Commander F. N. Cook, RAN, an officer who had won the DSC while serving with the Royal Navy during the Bruneval Raid. At the time he was recalled to Australia, Cook was in command of HMS Tormenter, a Royal Navy Combined Operations School. The Port Stephens school trained beach parties and boat crews. Graduates were posted to the Australian landing ships Kanimbla, Manoora, and Westralia, each of which had a beach party as part of its complement. These beach parties saw little action, as the valuable landing ships were rarely risked in forward areas in 1943. An eight-man RAN beach party under the command of Lieutenant Commander J. M. Band, RANR, participated in the Battle of Scarlet Beach. Band was fatally wounded in the fighting, and was awarded the US Navy Cross posthumously. In October 1943, the Australian Army's commander in chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, asked for the beach parties to be detached from their ships for training with the 6th Division and the 1st Beach Group at Cairns. Because United States Navy doctrine was that beach parties were a part of a ship's complement, Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey was reluctant to agree. Blamey suggested that a separate unit be raised for service with the Australian Army. A RAN Beach Commando was formed on 6 January 1944. All RAN Beach Commando personnel were listed as part of the complement of HMAS Assault, but formed a part of the 1st Beach Group. In early 1944, the army raised a 2nd Beach Group, and another beach commando was formed for it. Following Royal Navy practice, the two units were designated Beach Commando A and Beach Commando B. Later, the army requested two smaller commandos for subsidiary operations. These were formed as Beach Commandos C and D, and were organised similarly to A and B, but with only two beach parties, and no boat repair section. The four beach commandos were grouped administratively as the RAN Beach Unit (RANBU) under Commander R. S. Pearson, RAN, as Senior Naval Officer Beach Units (SNOBU). Organisation A beach commando consisted of: * a headquarters with a commander as principal beachmaster, a lieutenant commander as deputy principal beachmaster, and two seamen as messengers * three beach parties, each commanded by a lieutenant or lieutenant commander as beachmaster, with two officers as assistant beachmasters, two petty officers, and 22 seamen. * a boat repair and recovery section under a boatswain, with two petty officers and 14 seamen as boat crews, plus two artisan's mates, two torpedomen, a sailmaker's mate, for shipwrights and joiners, four motor mechanics and two stokers in the repair section. * a beach signals section under a sub lieutenant or midshipman, with a yeoman of signals, a petty officer telegraphist, four leading seamen. two leading telegraphists, ten signalmen, and 10 telegraphists. Operations In April 1945, Beach Commando B under Commander B. G. B. Morris, RANVR, went into action in the Battle of Tarakan, supporting the Army's 26th Infantry Brigade and 2nd Beach Group. Two beach commandos were killed and two wounded. Morris was awarded the U.S. Bronze Star for his role in the Tarakan Landings. Beach Commandos A and C, under Lieutenant Commander R. McKauge D.S.C., RANVR, took part in the 9th Division and 1st Beach Group's landings at Brunei and Labuan.

One of its main feeder schools is Warwick Preparatory School, which takes girls from the ages of 3 to 11 and boys up to the age of 7. History Plans for a girls' school in Warwick were drawn up as long ago as 1875, but the school could not get underway until 1879. In this year boys from The King's School, Warwick, later to become known as Warwick School, who were being taught in Landor House, the modern site of the girls' school and the birthplace of the poet Walter Savage Landor, finally moved to their new buildings south of the River Avon. KHS, The Squirrels (the nickname of the Prep School) and Warwick School now form the Warwick Schools Foundation. The King's High School for Girls has suffered throughout its history from being very short of space, and, since its foundation, has taken over the buildings of two neighbouring schools. The premises of one of them, the former King's Middle School (which was only in existence from 1875 to 1906), caught fire in 1970. There are now brand new buildings, including a new sixth form building, completed in 2006, on the former Middle School site. It was opened in December 2006 by Dame Judi Dench, new Art, Music and DT facilities, and new refurbished dining room. The school no longer has the lease on the former St Peter's Chapel, known as the Eastgate, situated at the top of Smith Street. There is an astroturf pitch and over of playing fields on land adjoining Warwick School's own playing fields half a mile to the south. Increasing levels of co-operation between Warwick School and King's High School for Girls has led to the joint teaching of certain AS Level and A Level subjects from September 2004, for example drama, physical education and most recently politics.

He is best known as a Surrey master builder and developer of St Georges Hill and the Wentworth Estate in Surrey. Biography In 1895, aged 20, he set up his own building company, W G Tarrant Ltd, in the village of Byfleet, Surrey and in the early 1900s built extensively in adjoining Pyrford, West Byfleet and Woking. The company almost certainly constructed some of the first buildings at nearby Brooklands. By 1911 his premises in Byfleet covered over five acres and included workshops for joinery, wrought iron and leaded lights, a stonemason‚Äôs yard, and a timber mill with drying sheds. He also owned nurseries in Addlestone and Pyrford and brickfields in Chobham and Rowlands Castle. In 1911 he bought of Surrey scrubland from the Egertons, the family of Lord Ellesmere which he developed into the St George's Hill estate. Tarrant was subsequently responsible for constructing housing in Weybridge, Byfleet, Pyrford, Woking and also Virginia Water where he launched the Wentworth Estate in 1923. Women carpenters preparing Tarrant hut components near Calais, 1917 During World War One, his company manufactured large numbers of prefabricated wooden huts for military use on the Western Front and also designed and constructed the Tarrant Tabor six-engined triplane bomber, which crashed at Farnborough aerodrome when attempting its first flight on 26 May 1919. The company employed 5,000 people at Byfleet in the 1920s but towards the end of the decade the Depression reduced the demand for large expensive houses. However, Tarrant continued to win contracts for many new council houses in the Woking area. In August 1931, W G Tarrant Ltd entered receivership but the building department survived, reforming as Tarrant Builders Ltd with Tarrant's eldest son Percy as a director. This company built many houses in Virginia Water before and after World War II and the original company's land became owned by Wentworth Estates Ltd. Around 1940, Tarrant purchased Hafod Estate at Eglwys Newydd, near Cwmystwyth above Aberystwyth in Wales and moved to live there soon afterwards. He soon began felling trees for use as pit-props for the war-effort and also started to plan the restoration of the neglected mansion there. He died on 18 March 1942 at Hafod Mansion, as a result of a coronary thrombosis and was buried in the Hafod churchyard. Biographer Extensive research into the house-building was carried out by Mavis Swenarton who in 1992 described Tarrant as 'a man of vision and enterprise... with a reputation for high quality materials and good workmanship... an imposing figure, over six ft tall and a thick beard which gave him a striking resemblance to King Edward VII'.Swenarton, Mavis (1993) 'W G Tarrant: Master Builder and Developer' (Walton & Weybridge Local History Society, Monograph 54).

Development and production 1942 Harley-Davidson XA on display at the California Automobile Museum Harley-Davidson XA engine During WWII, the U.S. Army asked Harley-Davidson to design a specification of a motorcycle much like the BMWs used by German forces, with shaft drive, a boxer engine, and several other features that made the BMWs exceptionally reliable and low-maintenance machines. Harley was already producing the WLA, based on its traditional 45-degree V-twin but the army specifically wanted the one feature that the WLA didn‚Äôt have: shaft drive. So the company produced the XA, whose engine and drivetrain were based on the flathead BMW R71 (1938-1941) versus the overhead valve (OHV) BMW R75 (1941-1946). 1000 XAs were produced for evaluation. By the time production had begun, it was clear that the Jeep was the Army's general purpose vehicle of choice. No more XAs were ordered after the initial order of 1000. The less advanced but cheaper WLA was considered sufficient for its limited roles. In 1943, the XA's leading link fork was replaced with Harley- Davidson's first telescopic fork. Similar motorcycles in other countries From 1942, the BMW R71 would serve as the basis for the IMZ-Ural and KMZ-Dnepr M72 (U.S.S.R./Russia), and from 1956 the Chang Jiang CJ750 (China) which likewise pressed it into military service though parts should not be considered interchangeable across marques despite visual similarities. Cooling Harley-Davidson XA opposed-twin engine runs 100 ¬∞F cooler than a V-twin According to the American Motorcyclist Association's Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum, regarding the World-War-II-vintage Harley-Davidson XA, which has an opposed twin engine -- \\"Mechanically, the large cooling fins stuck straight out in the breeze, reportedly keeping the XA‚Äôs oil temperature 100 F¬∞ (55.6 C¬∞) cooler than a standard Harley 45.\\" The latter was a transversely mounted V-twin, in which the air stream cannot reach the cylinders, especially the rear cylinder, as efficiently as on longitudinally mounted flat twin. (The use of \\"transverse\\" and \\"longitudinal\\" here is following automobile/car convention based on crankshaft alignment. However, with motorcycles the convention is based on width - hence cylinder orientation. Therefore, a flat or v-twin with left and right cylinders is transverse but with front and rear cylinders it is longitudinal.) Related projects Though the XA motorcycle was \\"dead\\" as far as the military was concerned for full-blown production, both the side-valve and overhead-valve versions of the XA engine were explored according to Jerry Hatfield in his book \\"Inside Harley-Davidson\\" 1990 published by Motorbooks International. A overhead-valve version XA motor was sent to Detroit Wax Paper for testing as a generator set. OHV XA motors of , with transmissions, were sent to Willys-Overland for testing as well as two blower-cooled XA motors for generators to be tested on tanks in 1943. There was even a Servi-Car prototype made called \\"The Model K\\" using the XA engine instead of the G motor planned for the 1946 model year.

In the Nabataean period, Mampsis was an important station on Incense Road, running from the Idumean Mountains, through the Arabah and Ma'ale Akrabim, and on to Beer-Sheva or to Hebron and Jerusalem. The city covers and is the smallest but best restored city in the Negev Desert. The once-luxurious houses feature unusual architecture not found in any other Nabataean city. The reconstructed city gives the visitor a sense of how Mampsis once looked. Entire streets have survived intact, and there are also large groups of Nabataean buildings with open rooms, courtyards, and terraces. The stones are carefully chiseled and the arches that support the ceiling are remarkably well constructed. Name The Medieval Greek name Mampsis (ŒúŒ±ŒºœàŒπœÇ) appears on the Madaba map and in the writings of Church Fathers. The Negev Naming Committee chose to Hebraize the name as Mamshit (◊û◊û◊©◊ô◊™), with one committee member stating that it is \\"impossible to leave the name Mampsis because it's a foreign name\\"; the committee concluded that Mamshit was the original Hebrew name, which had been distorted by the Greeks.  History  Mampsis on the Madaba map Mampsis was founded in the 1st century BC as trade post between Petra and Gaza. Also based on agriculture, it continued to develop over time. When its trade with the Roman occupation waned the city developed a lucrative trade breeding fine horses, notably, the renowned Arabian horse. During the Byzantine period Mampsis received support from the authorities as a frontier city until the time of Justinian when this funding ceased and the city went into decline. Before the founding of the State of Israel, Prime Minister to-be David Ben-Gurion saw Mampsis as the capital of the future country, which dovetailed with his dream of settling the Negev Desert. Two churches were discovered in Mampsis. The western St. Nilus Church has a mosaic floor with colourful geometric patterns, birds, a fruit basket, and five dedications in Greek. The eastern church has a lectern on small marble pillars, the remnants of which can be seen at the site. The biggest hoard of treasure ever found in Israel was discovered in Mampsis; 10,500 silver coins, a 72Kg, lead ingot with its foundry markings, a collection of ancient Greek texts on papyrus, and other objects indicative of wealthy people.

According to historian Richard Pankhurst, \\"contacts between the land which came to be known as Ethiopia and India date back to the dawn of history.\\" Trade between India and the Axumite Kingdom flourished in the 6th century A.D. The ancient port of Adulis served as an entry-pot and the hub of maritime trade where Indian traders flocked to trade in spices and silk for ivory and gold. In later periods, the arrival of Indians in the 17th Century with the support of the Portuguese, the Indian troops in 1868 brought by Robert Napier who was then the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Bombay and in 1935 when fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia were important events. Indian artisans and workers played an important role in the development of the famous city of Gondar and the Palace of Emperor Fasilidas General Rawley had been loaned by India to set up a Military Academy for Ethiopia. A large number of Indians had been employed between the late sixties and the nineties on a contractual basis to teach in the country‚Äôs primary and secondary schools. But with the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by Colonel Mengistu, the new communist regime introduced a policy of ‚ÄúEthiopianisation‚Äù which meant that foreigners were not allowed to teach in Ethiopian schools. Consequently, all the teachers and a large number of Indian businessmen moved to other destinations. Only a few Indians remained behind, among whom were those who had settled down in the country for more than three generations Hindus in Ethiopia At one time there were more than 9,000 families in Ethiopia. By the mid-80s their number had come down to 8,000. Presently, the Indian community numbers approximately 1,500 nationals plus an approx. number of 400 teaching staff on contractual assignment Around a hundred of them are businessmen. Mainly from Gujarat, they work as commission agents of various import-export companies. Another 150 are professors who teach in the Defence Ministry‚Äôs Engineering College and in various faculties of leading Ethiopian universities and other institutions of higher learning, while two professor are there in Mekelle University serving in the department of Sociology. Six of them teach in the Civil Services College, a prestigious institution under the Prime Minister‚ÄôsOffice that is similar to our Administrative Staff College. Indian Associations in Ethiopia There are three associations, The Indian Association set up in 1937, The Hindu Mahajan and The Malayalam Association. There is also an Indian National School which is an autonomous institution set up in 1947 under the auspices of the Indian Association Hindus are allowed cremation rights in Hindu Mahajan located in Addis Ababa. Indian businessmen Indian businessmen run two of the three Indian restaurants in Addis Ababa. Several Indian PSUs - TCIL, WAPCOS, RITES, ICT, Lea Associates South Asia Pvt. etc. have won a number of contracts. Lea Associates had successfully completed 6 Prestigious Highway Projects in different parts of Ethiopia and 4 projects are still undergoing. Their officials in Ethiopia enjoy a good rapport with their local counterparts. All in all, Ethiopians hold the Indian community in high esteem.http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.

Stiennon, Li√®ge, 1982, pp. 579-596. was most likely born in or around Li√®ge in the years 1075-1080, and there, as was the custom, was brought by his family as an oblate to the Benedictine abbey of Saint- Laurent in Li√®ge, which already a generation earlier had become a notable centre of learning, including mathematics, hagiography, and poetry. There Rupert eventually made monastic profession and was educated under the capable Abbot, Berengar. It 1092, in the context of the conflict between the papacy and the Empire, known as the Investiture Controversy, which in Germany encompassed nearly 50 years of civil war (1076-1122), Rupert joined other monks in following their abbot, Berengar, into exile in northern France, from where he returned in 1095. According to differing sources, around 1106 or 1109 he was ordained a priest by the Bishop of Li√®ge, Otbert, a powerful figure, and a close supporter of Emperor Henry IV. While the minor works of Rupert's youth seem to have largely perished, it was from shortly after his priestly ordination, about the year 1110, that he began producing an immense volume of surviving writings, which were widely known to his contemporaries, and though in some quarters they were not without influence, they also won him strong opposition. In was apparently because of this theological opposition that around 1116 Rupert underwent another exile (1116-1117), to the Abbey of Michaelsberg, Siegburg, where the Abbot was Cuno. Abbot of Siegburg 1105-1126, Bishop of Regensburg 1126-1132, cf. J. Semmler, 'Die Klosterreform von Siegburg: Ihre Ausbreitung und ihr Reformprogramm im 11. und 12.

Heinzmann (edd.), Wahrheit und Verk√ºndigung, M√ºnchen & Paderborn, 1967, II, p. 1143. In 1119, partly for the same reasons, there came a third exile, first to Siegburg and then to Cologne, and lastly in 1120 Frederick I, Archbishop of Cologne, Cf. E. Wisplinghoff, Friederich I. Erzbischoff von K√∂ln 1100-1131, Bonn 1951. appointed him abbot of the monastery of St Heribert in Deutz, founded in 1003 but later named for Saint Heribert, Archbishop of Cologne, who had died in 1021 and been buried in the abbey church. Deutz is now a suburb of Cologne. Theologian and Musician 1530 woodcut of Deutz Abbey At Deutz, Rupert emerged as a prominent theologian, For his thought, cf. M. Magrassi, Teologia e storia nel pensiero di Ruperto di Deutz, Roma 1959; W. Beinert, Die Kirche-Gottes Heil in der Welt.

These works demonstrate among other things his familiarity with the disciplines of the trivium and quadrivium of medieval education in the liberal arts and his acquaintance with the Scriptures. The main works include: *De voluntate Dei *De omnipotentia Dei *Commentaria in Canticum canticorum *De divinis Officiis *De Victoria Verbi Dei *De Gloria et Honore Filii Hominis super Mattheum *De Trinitate et operibus eius, written around 1112‚Äì1116. *De glorificatione Trinitatis et processione Spiritus sancti, written in 1128. Of these works, the most widely known was his De divinis officiis, which dealt with the liturgy and includes observations on plainchant. Other of his theological writings lead to his entering into controversy with Anselm of Laon and Anselm‚Äôs disciple William of Champeaux, later to be the master of Peter Abelard. Other works, such as Rupert‚Äôs De Trinitate, also incidentally offer treatments on music, and it is possible that at Li√®ge he studied music under a monk called Heribrand. Rupert himself makes mention of a hymn he wrote to the Holy Spirit. Moreover, it is thought that in his youth he wrote others in honour of St Heribert, as also of St Mary Magdalene, St Goar and St Severinus. Lawrence Guishee, 'Rupert of Deutz [Rupertus Tuitiensis]', in Grove Music Online: https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.24143 accessed 7.10.2020 His writings were later scrutinized in relation with the doctrine of impanation, a Eucharistic heresy from the point of view of the Catholic Church because, contrary to the dogma of transubstantiation wherein the substance (but not the appearances and physical characteristics) of the bread and wine is seen as being wholly converted into the substance of Christ's Body and Blood, united to his divine Person, impanation maintains that Christ directly unites the substance of the bread and wine to his divine person (or sometimes to his human nature), just as he united his own body and blood to his divine Person. They influenced the theology in particular of Honorius Augustodunensis and Gerhoch of Reichersberg. Abbot Rupert died in Deutz on March 4, 1129.

The reverse Krebs cycle (also known as the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, the reverse TCA cycle, or the reverse citric acid cycle) is a sequence of chemical reactions that are used by some bacteria to produce carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by the use of energy- rich reducing agents as electron donors. The reaction is the citric acid cycle run in reverse: Where the Krebs cycle takes complex carbon molecules in the form of sugars and oxidizes them to CO2 and water, the reverse cycle takes CO2 and water to make carbon compounds. This process is used by some bacteria to synthesise carbon compounds, sometimes using hydrogen, sulfide, or thiosulfate as electron donors. In this process, it can be seen as an alternative to the fixation of inorganic carbon in the reductive pentose phosphate cycle which occurs in a wide variety of microbes and higher organisms. The reaction is a possible candidate for prebiotic early-earth conditions and, so, is of interest in the research of the origin of life. It has been found that some non-consecutive steps of the cycle can be catalyzed by minerals through photochemistry, while entire two and three-step sequences can be promoted by metal ions and iron (as reducing agent) under acidic conditions.

It had its beginnings in 1802, with a partnership between John Ward, James Blow and Robert Greenfield. By the 1820s they owned paper mills in Belfast, Comber and Coleraine. which operated under the company name of John Ward and Sons. In the early 1830s Marcus Ward (son of John Ward) took over the running of the Belfast paper mill. Then in 1833 Marcus formed a new company, Marcus Ward & Sons, based in Belfast, having a new direction, in stationery and general publishing. Marcus Ward and Sons soon became very successful in the area of colour lithography, winning a medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. By the time Marcus died in 1847 his three sons, Francis, William and John, had successfully taken over the running of the business. (In later life John was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA), committee member of the Egypt Exploration Society and author of several titles on Middle Eastern archaeology, sometimes illustrated by his own watercolours.) In the 1860s Marcus Ward & Co began mass-producing calendars and greeting cards. Initially they printed cards for other publishers such as Goodall and Charles Bennett. By the late 1860s they began printing greeting cards under their own name. This venture turned out to be very successful, the company engaging Thomas Crane as artistic director and talented artists such as Kate Greenaway and Walter Crane as illustrators. In the early years of card production they marked the reverse with their trademark. In later years the company name was printed on the front side of their greeting cards.

It was a two-seat, single-engine, equal-span biplane seaplane used primarily by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Development The first prototype of the Type 90-2 Reconnaissance Seaplane, or E4N1, flew in 1930. This was fitted with twin floats and had no cowling for the engine. This prototype was rejected. The type was completely redesigned as the Type 90-2-2 or E4N2, with a single main-float and twin, wing-mounted outriggers and introduced a cowled engine. This entered production for the Navy in 1931. A landplane version of the Type 90-2-2 was developed as the E4N2-C with a tailwheel undercarriage Operational history The E4N2 was employed as a shipboard reconnaissance seaplane launched by catapult. In 1933, nine E4N2-C airframes were converted to P1 mail planes. Single-seat landplanes with an enclosed cockpit, these were employed on night-mail services between the Japanese Home Islands.

Grimston was the son of James Grimston, 2nd Viscount Grimston, and Mary Bucknall. He was educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1773 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He was instead elected to the House of Commons for St Albans in 1783, a seat he held until the next year's election, where he instead stood for and represented the larger, county level seat of Hertfordshire from 1784 to 1790. In 1790 he was created Baron Verulam, of Gorhambury in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords.

He was Emeritus Professor of Physiology and Director of the Vision, Touch and Hearing Research Centre at the University of Queensland in Australia. Research Pettigrew's research interest was in comparative neuroscience. He studied a variety of different birds and mammals with modern neural tracing techniques to unravel principles of brain organization. He was the chief proponent of the Flying primates theory, which was based on the similarity between the brains of megabats and primates. Special emphasis was placed on the visual, auditory and somatosensory systems. Pettigrew was the first person to clarify the neurobiological basis of stereopsis when he described neurones sensitive to binocular disparity. Later, he discovered that owls have independently evolved a system of binocular neurones like those found in mammals. Pettigrew showed evidence for a role for non-visual pathways in the phenomenon of developmental neuroplasticity during the postnatal critical period. Pettigrew used binocular rivalry as an assay for interhemispheric switching, whose rhythm is altered in bipolar disorder.

Her poetic universe is often dark and inclined to pessimism. Perhaps the fact that she is unable to visit her native region in the North helps to explain the many images of life as an unending journey found in her work.

He speaks in kansai-ben. ; : :Dokurobei is the elusive boss of the Dorombo Gang. He gives orders regarding the location of the Dokuro Stone to his subordinates in unusual ways, such as through a talking hamburger or the image of a red skull on a TV screen. Even when his leads are revealed to be inaccurate, Dokurobei is always quick to punish the Dorombo Gang when they fail. =Mechas= ; : :A dog-shaped robot, Yatterwan was designed by Gan's father as a prototype rescue robot. He is fitted with a siren and a bell, similar to other rescue vehicles, plus a joystick to control his other features. Yatterwan can fire iron pellets from his nostrils and carries two fire hoses on his back. A bone-shaped power pack, known as \\"Mecha-Tonic\\", is fed to him and allows a sudden outburst of strength in warding off a deadly blow. Yatterwan's special attack is a large group of miniature robots, usually taking the shape of land-based animals, which exit from his mouth. The mini- robots use their weapons on their enemy, causing Doronbo's robots to explode and create a skull-shaped cloud. ; : :Yatter-King was built using the damaged remains of Yatterwan. It's a much larger machine, resembling a crossover of a fire engine with a dachshound. It comes with a complete series of new features, including a tail that serves as a firehose, a projectile launcher on its rear, and a body which acts as a mecha-carrier for a series of smaller robots. In the 2009 version, it was formed by combining Yatterwan and Yatter- zero, which has a design with a more fighting ability and a \\"king\\" like appearance. ; : :Yatter-Pelican is a pelican robot who appeared in the 14th episode. He's constructed by Gan as an airborne mecha for the Yatterman duo. Yatter-Pelican has a braggard, loud-mouthed personality. He feeds on a fish- shaped Mecha-Tonic for a power boost, and the mini-robots it releases are shaped like various birds. In the 2008 version, he tends to speak in bits of English in certain sentences. ; : :Yatter-Angler is a goosefish robot who appeared in the 27th episode. He's constructed as the only all-terrain mecha for the Yatterman Duo, and is equipped with a cockpit for underwater travels. The Mecha-Tonic is in the shape of a fish-roe, and releases mini-robots shaped like marine creatures. He has a funny, constantly gurgling voice as if talking underwater. ; : :Yatter-Phant is an elephant mecha. The machine is introduced in the 92nd episode as an alternate mecha carrier alongside Yatter-King. Its most noticeable feature are the ears, which flap in order to allow flight, and its trunk serves as a water-hose/flamethrower. ; : :He's a bulldog robot.

He, like Yatter-Dozilla, specializes in underground work. ; : :An Asian dragon based mecha introduced in episode 50 of the 2008 version. It only seems to appear in a major crisis, often when the other robots aren't available or functional. =Villains' machines= The shape and function of their mechas is fully dependent on the theme of the scam-business they run at the beginning of each episode. Their machines usually feature a familiar interior with Boyacky and Tonzura sitting at the sides, and Doronjo sitting in the middle bossing the two. The villains' machines are often seen packing a lot of weaponry and usually temporarily defeat Yatterman mechas at the beginning of each fight. Later in the show, the villains start to deploy their own armies of miniature robots to counter those of Yatterman.

This unit includes an entire battalion, acting as support and reserve for Airborne units which contains for example, military war dogs and Airborne Pathfinders and an instruction battalion responsible for the forming of new paratroopers. The RP√°ra is part of the Rapid Reaction Brigade that includes other elite units like the Army Comandos and Army Special Operations. Like other Portuguese Airborne units, the troops of the School are nicknamed \\"Boinas Verdes\\" (Green Berets) while recruits are nicknamed \\"Catatuas\\". History =Origins= =The Airborne Battalion= After the successful use of airborne forces in the Second World War by Germany and the Allies, other armed forces began to examine the possibility of forming parachute Troops for special missions. In 1955, Portuguese Defense Ministry cabinet approved a request for funds for airborne paratroop training. Two Army captains went to France to take the French parachute course at the √âcole de Troupes Aeroport√®es. After the Portuguese Air Force was created as an independent branch of the military, was decided that the paratroopers would be part of the Air Force, much like the German organizational structure during World War II. The BCP - Batalh√£o de Ca√ßadores P√°raquedistas (Paratrooper Hunters Battalion) was formed in 1956. The paratroopers were issued unique berets and camo uniforms. Airborne forces initially jumped using the venerable German tri-motored Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. The unit was first deployed to Tancos, which still serves as headquarters for today's Portuguese airborne forces. =Colonial Wars and the Regiment= In 1961, conflict erupted in the African colonies, which soon evolved into a series of guerrilla campaigns against Portuguese rule. Troops were required to fight in Africa, and the BCP became the RCP, or Regimento de Ca√ßadores P√°ra-quedistas (Paratrooper Hunter, or Ranger Regiment). By this time, the men were armed with the modern 7,62mm ArmaLite AR-10 infantry rifle, a weapon previously not seen in Western military forces.Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), pp. 183-184 The paratroopers liked the accuracy and mobility of the AR-10, but supplies were embargoed after initial deliveries were completed in 1960, and paratroopers were later issued the collapsible-stock variant of the m/961 (G3) rifle. As time went on, more airborne units were created in Angola, Mozambique, and other areas outside Portugal to fight the various separatist guerrilla movements. Due to Portuguese Air Force control over airborne units, the paratroops' battalion numbers reflected their subordination to local Air Force command, 1st Air Region (Air Force command over north atlantic territories) command 11th (Portugal) and 12th (Guin√©-Bissau) Paratrooper Hunter Battalion, 2nd Air Region (Air Force command over South Atlantic territories) command the 21st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion (Angola) and the 3rd Air Region (Air Force command over the Indian ocean territories) command the 31st and 32nd Paratrooper Hunter Battalion (Mozambique). =Paratrooper casualties= * 12th Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 56 dead (3 officers, 6 sergeants and 47 soldiers). * 21st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 47 dead (5 officers, 9 sergeants and 33 soldiers) * 31st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 39 dead (2 officers, 6 sergeants and 31 soldiers) * 32nd Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 18 dead (2 sergeants and 16 soldiers) A total of 160 Portuguese paratroopers were KIA. On April 25, 1974, a military coup led by left-wing members of the Portuguese Army ended the authoritarian government regime in Portugal, and the country moved towards fully democratic elections. Shortly afterwards, peace negotiations with the various African colonies resulted in an end to the African wars, followed by the independence of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. Military reforms were instituted in Portugal in 1975, resulting in a reorganization of airborne forces. In November 2007, a Paratrooper was killed in a vehicle accident in Afghanistan Modern airborne forces structure = Parachute Troops Base School = On July 5, 1975, the BETP (Base Escola de Tropas P√°ra-Quedistas or Parachute Troops Base School) was formed at the RCP, which was disbanded and integrated into the CTP or Corpo de Tropas Paraquedistas Parachute Troops Corps) of the Portuguese Air Force. The CTP is responsible for changing the paratroopers from a counter- guerrilla force to a conventional airborne force capable of fighting in a possible NATO vs Warsaw Pact war, so a Light Paratrooper Brigade (BRIPARAS) was formed with three Paratrooper Battalions and a few support units. The Corps also raised several barracks across Portugal to garrison the new brigade, BOTP1 ‚Äì Base Operacional de Tropas P√°ra-quedistas n¬∫1 (1st Paratrooper Operational Base) at Monsanto and BOTP2 at S√£o Jacinto; some troops were also garrisoned in the BETP at Tancos. The BRIPARA structure included: * BOTP1: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫11, Anti-Tank Company, Signals Company * BOTP2: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫21, Services and Support Operational Group, Heavy Mortar Company * BETP: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫31, Aeroterrestrial Operational Group =Army integration= In 1993, further changes in the organization of airborne forces took place when the Defense Minister decided that the entire corps should leave the Portuguese Air Force and become part of the Portuguese Army. This meant also that the Commandos Regiment would be disbanded and the commandos that had taken the parachute course would be part of the new unit which was named BAI - Brigada Aerotransportada Independente (Independent Airborne Brigade). The BETP then changed its name again to ETAT - Escola de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops School), the Paratrooper Corp changed to the Comando de Tropas Aerotransportas (Airborne Troops Command) and all three Paratrooper Battalions changed to Airborne Infantry Battalions (BIAT). This new Army Airborne Brigade was bigger and more powerful due to the previous Air Force Light Paratrooper Brigade; they had replaced heavy mortars with 105 mm artillery guns and were equipped with light armor vehicles. In territorial terms the BOTP1 was closed and BOTP2 changed its name to the S√£o Jacinto Military Area. The units of the brigade that were not at Tancos (Airborne Support Battalion) or S√£o Jacinto (2nd BIAT) were now garrisoned at Army barracks (Regiments) like the 15th Infantry Regiment at Tomar (1st BIAT), 3rd Infantry Regiment at Beja (3rd BIAT), 4th Artillery Regiment at Leiria (Grupo de Artilharia Aerotransportada ‚Äì Airborne Artillery Group), 3rd Cavalry Regiment at Estremoz (Esquadr√£o de Reconhecimento Aerotransportado ‚Äì Airborne Recon Squadron) and others. The BAI structure was: * 15th Infantry Regiment: 1st BIAT, Services and Support Battalion * S√£o Jacinto Military Area: 2nd BIAT, Anti-Tank Company * 3rd Infantry Regiment: 3rd BIAT * 4th Artillery Regiment: Field Artillery Group * ETAT: Aeroterrestrial Support Battalion * Tancos Airfield: Signals Company * Engineering Practical School: Engineering Company * 3rd Cavalry Regiment: Recon Squadron * 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment: Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery =Elite Forces Brigade= The next reorganization of the Army though, changed the ETAT designation again to ETP ‚Äì Escola de Tropas P√°raquedistas (School of Parachute Troops) with the BAI being renamed and reorganized as BRR ‚Äì Brigada de Reac√ß√£o R√°pida . The Airborne Troops Command was disbanded. Currently, airborne forces are under direct control of regular army commands, such as Land Forces Operational Command (operational units) or the Instruction Command (ETP ‚Äì Paratrooper School). The last reorganization of the Army changed ETP's name to the present Regimento de Paraquedistas (Paratroopers' Regiment), RP√°ra. The Elite Forces brigade is no longer a full deployable brigade, but rather an organizational structure that controls all the special trained army units. The 3rd Airborne Infantry Battalion and Anti-Tank Company were disbanded and the other two BIAT were renamed Paratrooper Infantry Battalions (BIParas), the S√£o Jacinto Military Area was renamed 10th Infantry Regiment, the Airborne Artillery Group and the Services and Support Battalion were transferred to the Intervention Brigade and their no longer Airborne capable and the Engineering Company and the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery were reduced to platoon size. This new Rapid Reaction Brigade joined all remaining Paratrooper units together with Army Special Operations and the reborn battalion-size Army Comandos unit. Finally a newly formed unit has joined BRR: UALE (Army Light Aviation Unit), which is waiting to be equipped with NH-90 TTH and a still-to-be-chosen light utility helicopter, possibly the Eurocopter EC-135 or the AgustaWestland AW109. BRR forces include: * 15th Infantry Regiment: 1st BIPara * 10th Infantry Regiment: 2nd BIPara * RP√°ra: Aeroterrestrial Battalion * Commandos Troop Center: Commando Battalion * Special Operations Troop Center: Special Operations Forces * Army Light Aviation Unit: Army Helicopter Group, Signals Company * 3rd Cavalry Regiment: Recon Squadron * Engineering Practical School: Engineering Platoon * 1st Anti- Aircraft Artillery Regiment: Air Defence Platoon Candidate Selection =General Conditions= * Be a volunteer * Be a Portuguese citizen * Be at least 18 years old and 24 at the most for enlisted ranks * Be psychophysically and physically fit * Minimum height is 1.60m for males and 1.56m for females * Clean criminal registry * Minimum school grade required is the 9th for enlisted, 12th for NCOs and a college degree to officers = Admission tests = * Medical exams * Sensorial exams * Psychiatric and physical exams * Biographic questionnaire * Psychological interview * Physical tests RP√°ra Courses =Formation Courses= * Basic Instruction. * Complementary Instruction. ** Pathfinder Auxiliary Course. ** Parachute Maintenance Course. ** Air Supply Operator Course. ** Trainer of Military dogs. =Qualification Courses= * Parachute Course. * Airborne Basic Course. * Airborne Operations Course. * Parachute Instructor Course. * Free Fall Course. * Operational Free Fall Course. * Free Fall Instructor Course. * Manual Jump Master Course. * Pathfinder Course. * Air Supply Instructor Course. * Air Supply Inspector Course. * Airborne Equipment Tecnic Course. * Airborne Equipment and Parachutes Maintenance Course. * Complementary Paratrooper Course (officers and sergeants). * Complementary Paratrooper Course (soldiers).

His book \\"Memories About Bulgarian Uprisings\\" was published posthumously and is a primary source of historical information about those events.  Biography  = Early life = Nikola Obretenov was born on 28 May 1849 in Ruse, the administrative centre of Danube Province, Ottoman Empire, in the family of Tiho Obretenov ‚Äî a wealthy and educated Bulgarian of that time ‚Äî and Tonka Obretenova. In January 1863, being a student in a local school, Nikola Obretenov took part in the expulsion of the Greek bishop Sinesiy. Next year he graduated, and in the autumn he went to his father in the village of Sakcha in Northern Dobruja (modern Romania). They established a Bulgarian school there, which existed until March 1866. = Involvement in revolutionary organizations = From November 1867 on, Nikola Obretenov was a librarian and a member of the board of trustees of the Zora cultural club, established in 1866 by Dragan Tsankov and other intellectuals. The club turned into one of BRCC's safe houses. On 7 June 1871 Hristo \\"the bookbinder\\" Ivanov invited Nikola Obretenov to take part in the revolutionary struggle as a messenger between Bulgaria and BRCK in Bucharest. On 29 June 1871 Obretenov travelled to Bucharest to present his references to the chairman of BRCK, Lyuben Karavelov. After being approved by Karavelov, Nikola Obretenov along with Dimitar Gorov of Giurgiu developed an illegal channel for transferring mail, printed materials, and weapons between Bucharest‚ÄìGiurgiu and Rousse. Following Lyuben Karavelov's and Angel Kanchev's orders, Nikola Obretenov, Toma Kardzhiev, and Radi Ivanov established the Rousse private revolutionary committee. The constituent session of the committee took place on 10 December 1871 in Nikola Obretenov's (and baba Tonka's) house. The committee later admitted Georgi Ikonomov, Gancho Karamazhdrakov, Ilarion Dragostinov, Nikola Sakilarov, Zahari Stoyanov, Nikola Tabakov, and many others. From 29 April to 4 May 1872 Nikola Obretenov was a delegate to the meeting in Bucharest. Twenty-five people ‚Äî representatives of the private revolutionary committees of Bulgaria and Wallachia ‚Äî took part. They accepted the new statutes of BRCK, re-elected Karavelov as a chairman of the Bucharest committee, and authorized Vasil Levski to form a \\"Temporary government\\" in Bulgaria, wherever he would find appropriate. Near the end of June 1872, Nikola Obretenov transported the printed statutes, the receipts and other documents, as well as Levski's uniform, sabre, and gun through the developed illegal channel, assisted by baba Tonka, Petrana Obretenova, Todorka Mirazchieva, and Natalia Karavelova. In 1873 Nikola Obretenov made an acquaintance with Stefan Stambolov, who expressed his willingness to get involved in the struggle as Vasil Levski's deputy. On 20 August and 21 August 1874 Nikola Obretenov took part in BRCK's session in Bucharest, which re- elected Karavelov as a chairman of the committee, elected Hristo Botev as a secretary, and confirmed Stefan Stambolov as a chief apostle in Bulgaria and a deputy of Vasil Levski. = Stara Zagora uprising = In August 1875, Nikola Obretenov participated in BRCK's sessions, presided by Hristo Botev. A decision was made for Bulgaria to revolt in mid-September 1875. The country would be divided into the following regions: * Rousse-Shumen region, including Varna and Razgrad with Nikola Obretenov as an apostle * Stara Zagora region with Stefan Stambolov as an apostle * Tarnovo region with Mihail Sarafov as an apostle * Sliven region with Tanyu Stoyanov as an apostle * Lovech-Troyan with Stoyan Dragnev as an apostle Stoyan Zaimov was given the task to set Tsarigrad \\"on fire\\", Hristo Botev had to bring Filip Totyu along from Odessa, and Panayot Hitov was to negotiate with Belgrade. Until the outburst of the Stara Zagora uprising of 16 September 1875, Nikola Obretenov actively took part in the preparation of the Chervena Voda detachment and the training of population in nearby villages. After the uprising's suppression because of Andrey Momchev's treason, more than 1,000 people were captured. On 27 September 1875 Nikola Obretenov hid in the house of Karamihaylov, an interpreter in the Russian consulate, who organized his escape to Romania. In September 1875 Dimitar Gorov gave accommodation to Nikola Obretenov and Stoyan Zaimov in Giurgiu, in a place they used to call \\"the barracks\\". In October Panayot Volov joined them. So did those who returned from Tsarigrad‚ÄîGeorgi Benkovski, Ivanitsa Danchov, and Hristo Karaminkov. Near the end of October, Stefan Stambolov and Ilarion Dragostinov came from Bucharest. 250px = April uprising = In mid-November 1875, the Giurgiu revolutionary committee was established and started functioning, presided by Stefan Stambolov. Stoyan Zaimov was appointed as a secretary, and the members were Panayot Volov, Nikola Obretenov, Ilarion Dragostinov, Hristo Karaminkov, Georgi Apostolov, Georgi Ikonomov, Georgi Obretenov, and Georgi Izmirliev. The sessions continued until 25 December 1875. A decision was made to prepare the April uprising, which was to break out on 11 May 1876. With that end in view, the country was divided into five regions (according to Nikola Obretenov): # Tarnovo region with apostles Stefan Stambolov, Georgi Izmirliev, Hristo Karaminkov, Hristo \\"the big\\" Ivanov # Sliven region with apostles Ilarion Dragostinov, Georgi Ikonomov, Georgi Obretenov, and Stoil voivoda # Plovdiv region with apostles Panayot Volov, Georgi Benkovski, Zahari Stoyanov, Todor Kableshkov # Sofia region with apostles Nikola Obretenov and Nikola Slavkov # Vratsa region with apostles Stoyan Zaimov and Georgi Apostolov In the beginning of 1876 the \\"apostles\\" headed towards their designated revolutionary regions. On 24 January 1876 Nikola Obretenov and Georgi Apostolov crossed the Danube at Oryahovo and set off for Vratsa. There, taking into account the situation, Zaimov and Nikola Obretenov decided that he and Georgi Apostolov should return to Romania to buy weapons, which they could bring to Vratsa with reinforcements, when the uprising burst out. Nikola Obretenov and Georgi Apostolov, assisted by the Craiova revolutionary committee, bought weapons and ammunitions, and Hristo Botev passionately took up organizing the detachment. On Monday, 17 May 1876 Nikola Obretenov with the detachment led by Hristo Botev came ashore from the Radetzky steamship on the bank of Kozloduy, where the rebels, kissing their native soil, took their oaths under the flag, crafted by his sister Petrana Obretenova. Nikola Obretenov fought in all of the detachment's battles. He was with Hristo Botev at the moment of his death on 20 May 1876. On 3 June 1927, as a member of a special commission, Nikola Obretenov ascertained the exact place of Hristo Botev's death, about which a written report was composed. After a month of fighting, roaming, and starvation through the grim mountains, on 17 June Nikola Obretenov and his companions Sava Penev, Dimitar Todorov, and Stoyan Lovchaliyata were betrayed by the brothers Pencho and Petar, and a Turkish posse captured them in the \\"Balyuviya han\\" inn near Shipkovo, Troyan. = Exile and post-liberation activities = The court in Tarnovo sentenced the rebels to death. The sentence was not signed, and the convicts were sent to Rousse in order for an emergency court to judge them. The court sentenced them again to death by hanging. Nikola Obretenov and Stoyan Zaimov were driven about in the city with their sentences hung on their necks. By the sultan's order, the sentence was replaced with an exile for life in Asia Minor. On 2 July 1876 in the St Jeanne d'Arc stronghold, Nikola Obretenov met his brother Angel, who had been in exile for eight years, for being a member of the detachment of Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha. Nikola Obretenov returned to his liberated fatherland in 1878, released by implication of the capitulations of the San Stefano treaty. Nikola Obretenov was eager to participate in the construction of modern Bulgaria. He was a member of the Liberal Party, and later of the People's Liberal Party, continuing his cooperation with Stefan Stambolov. He served as a governor of Tutrakan, in Silistra Province. He actively took part in the suppression of the Russophile riots in both Tutrakan and Rousse. In May 1907 Nikola Obretenov was elected to parliament, and as a mayor of Rousse. He died at the age of 90, on 11 October 1939, a couple of days before the official celebration of his anniversary. Nikola Obretenov is the author of many articles in the press and the author of the book \\"Memories about Bulgarian uprisings\\", published after his death, under the editorship of academician Mihail Arnaudov.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 5,003 and it contained 1,758 housing units. Burton Township was first settled by Englishmen in 1836, and the name English Prairie was given it. Later settlers called the township Benton, but upon it being learned that there was already a post office and township of Benton in Illinois, the name was changed to Burton on December 28, 1850. The reason Burton Township is so uncommonly small is because its first residents decided to break away from Richmond Township to its west. The reason for this was a \\"Hatfields vs. McCoys\\" type of feud in the 1840s over alleged township mismanagement and higher taxes in Richmond. The Burton settlers opted out and even tried to have adjoining Lake County absorb them into its eastern neighbor, Antioch Township, but Antioch Township had just consolidated Cooper Township into itself, and since Burton Township was situated in another county, a special law needed to be passed in Springfield to affect that change. [Curiously, Abraham Lincoln successfully represented the disgruntled residents of what would become Niantic Township Niantic Township, Macon County, Illinois to join downstate Macon County to escape the higher taxation of Shelby and Sangamon Counties in the late 1830s. Lincoln's fee was set at 7 and 1/2 percent of each landholder's tax saving for the first three years .... a fee gratefully paid by nearly all of the township's 'secessionists.' This episode was used by various Southern orators and newspapers, and their Northern sympathizers, to show Lincoln's inconsistency and hypocrisy in demanding that the Southern States could not secede from the Union after Fort Sumter, when he himself had argued that the Niantic settlers could \\"pick up and leave the rottenness of Shelby and Sangamon Counties as they saw fit, a God-given right of self-determination.\\" ] Geography According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , of which (or 99.26%) is land and (or 0.74%) is water.

The Amaru≈õataka or Amaruka≈õataka (‡§Ö‡§Æ‡§∞‡•Å‡§∂‡§§‡§ï, \\"the hundred stanzas of Amaru\\"), authored by Amaru (also Amaruka), is a collection of poems dated to about the 7th, Introduction or 8th century. The Amaru≈õataka ranks as one of the finest lyrical poetry in the annals of Sanskrit literature, ranking with Kalidasa and 's '. The ninth-century literary critic Anandavardhana declared in his Dhvanyaloka that \\"a single stanza of the poet Amaru ... may provide the taste of love equal to what's found in whole volumes.\\" Its verses have been used by poets and critics as examples and standards to judge other poems by. Andrew Schelling describes it as \\"love poetry original and vivid as that produced anywhere on the planet\\"., Introduction Its subject is mostly Sringara (erotic love, romantic love) including aspects such as love, passion, estrangement, longing, rapprochement, joy and sorrow, etc. Greg Bailey notes that it is \\"as much about the social aspects of courting, betrayal, feminine indignance and masculine self-pity as it is about sensuality\\". Similarly, Schelling notes: \\"All the flavours or nuances of love are said to lie within the book, though you'll notice that the emphasis falls more on the bitter taste of separation or betrayal than on the sweetness of consummation.\\" Authorship Not much is known about the life of Amaru. Traditional accounts attribute the work to King Amaru of Kashmir. The collection in its present form may well represent the work of more than one author‚Äîthe poems that form part of the collection differ quite significantly across its different regional recensions.According to Siegfried Lienhard, only around half the verses in the Amarusataka are common across its various regional versions. There are also a number of legends associating the collection with the philosopher Adi Shankara. One version occurs in his 14th century biography written by a follower, the Shankara-digvijaya. According to this version, during his debate with Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, he was asked philosophical questions phrased in metaphors of love by the latter's wife, Ubhaya Bharati. Being celibate and therefore ignorant of the kama shastras, Shankara requested an adjournment. He then entered the recently dead body of Amaru and spent a hundred days mastering the art of erotic love, before returning to defeat his opponent. He wrote the Amarushataka to memorialise his learning. Another version, given in Ravichandra's commentary on the Amarushataka, states that Shankara composed these poems to impart spiritual insight to the epicurean king Amaru, in metaphors he might understand. When this was misunderstood and mocked by the advisers at the court, Shankara entered the body of Amaru and provided a spiritual exegesis of the poems. Accordingly, several manuscripts add colophons naming Shankara as the true author of the work, and Ravichandra, a mediaeval commentator on the Bengal recension of the Amarusataka, read metaphysical meanings into the verses. Other legends also state that Amaru was the 101st reincarnation of a soul that had previously occupied 100 women.

The building is on the corner of Above Bar Street and Ogle Road in Southampton City Centre, with shops on the ground level and the auditorium and other rooms above them. History This history is based on Past and Present,Past and Present (Southampton: Above Bar Church, 1979) a booklet published by the church for the opening of a new building in 1981. =Founding of the church= Above Bar Church was established in 1876 by Henry Samuel Earl, a missionary with the Foreign Christian Missionary Society of the Disciples of Christ (then synonymous with the Churches of Christ; the two became formally separate in 1906). Earl started preaching in the Philharmonic Rooms on Above Bar Street (on the site of what later became the Odeon cinema and is now shops) in February 1876, with a local choir to lead the singing and the widow of a Congregational minister playing the organ. More than seven hundred people came to the first service, and even more the following week despite a snowstorm. On the third Sunday, the hall was full. The majority of these people were members of other churches, of course, but a regular congregation began to develop. Henry Earl rented a small Baptist church that was being used as a warehouse and had it repaired and furnished to seat more than 300 people. As well as filling this building to capacity on Sunday mornings, Earl was soon also running week-night services and had started a Sunday School. A church was formally established in August 1876 with an initial membership of 33. A clothing manufacturer from the north of England, Timothy Coop, donated ¬£3,000 to Earl towards the cost of buying land and constructing a permanent building. Between the Philharmonic Hall and Ogle Road was a plot of land, which Earl bought for ¬£1000. He also bought three more lots in Ogle Road for ¬£300. One of these was a skating rink (both ice skating and roller skating were popular in the late 1870s)Lynn Pearson, 'For Amusement Only ' and the other two were part of the grounds of a large mansion, Ogle Hall. Volunteers from the church dismantled the skating rink and used the bricks and windows for the new church building, which opened in 1880. On 17 August 1886, a Trust Deed was signed, passing the ownership of the site and building to the trustees of ‚ÄòChurch of Christ, Above Bar‚Äô. Henry Earl stayed in Southampton for less than ten years (though it seems he didn't return to the USA until 1891), by which time he had baptised around four hundred peopleThomas Hagger, 'Heralds of Christian Unity: Being Brief Biographical Sketches of Some Pioneers of the Restoration Movement (Melbourne: Austral Printing and Publishing Company, 1938). and the membership of the church had grown to over 100. Earl handed over leadership of the church to Aurelius Glidden, who stayed just two years, but who saw continued growth. There were six more ministers, mainly Americans, during the next 25 years, often with considerable gaps between them. The church continued to grow gradually, and increasingly moved away from the influence and control of the Church of Christ in America, as well as becoming more financially independent. =1912‚Äì1979= In 1912, a new minister was appointed, Frederick Phillips, a former electrical engineer. As a young man, he had been a deacon at Above Bar Congregational Church just down the road, and for the three years prior to becoming minister of the Church of Christ, he pastored a mission church in Winchester. In 1917, the final break with the American denomination came when British Churches of Christ were offered the opportunity to either join a national federation or become independent. The church continued to grow during World War I and, by the early 1920s, the membership had risen to 400, with much larger congregations. Phillips held the post for the next forty years, retiring in 1952 at the age of 82. At his retirement he recalled a time when the morning service had a congregation of only twenty, and commented that, ‚ÄòIt is really wonderful how God has brought it up‚Äô. Another minister remarked that he didn't know another church for miles around that had seen so many people converted to Christian faith. Frederick Phillips was succeeded by Leith Samuel, who was the minister for 27 years. Leith Samuel had previously been a Missioner with Intervarsity Fellowship and was a gifted evangelist and Bible teacher with a strong commitment to systematic expository preaching. This was a period of significant development in the church. It was renamed Above Bar Church, there was a growing commitment to world mission, home Bible study groups were introduced, and assistant ministers and pastoral workers were appointed. In the 1970s, the ageing building, built on a tight budget almost a hundred years before, was badly showing its age. After a major crack appeared in the ceiling in May 1976, it became clear that it would cost ¬£150,000 to repair the building. And it would still remain a large and inflexible Victorian barn of a building with very limited ancillary rooms. For a number of years, developers had been approaching the church wanting to make use of the prime site. Now, with a desperate need for action, another developer suggested a scheme with shops on the ground floor, the church above and still with an entrance on Above Bar Street. The church was positive about the plan and appointed Robert Potter, of Brandt Potter Associates, as architect. Royal Insurance Investment Department took over the developer's interest in the scheme and covered a substantial proportion of the building costs. The final service in the old building took place on 1 July 1979. =1980-= David Jackman, who was appointed as Assistant Minister in 1976, became the Senior Minister on Leith Samuel's retirement in 1980. The new church building opened in 1981 and provided much better facilities than the previous one, though with a smaller seating capacity in the main body of the church. The auditorium, which seats over four hundred, was designed by Robert Potter as a hexagon, drawing on the concept of the amphitheatre with the partially tiered seating angled towards the front. The ceiling is made of Columbian pine, while much of the woodwork at ground level is beech. The communion table, made for the new building is of English elm. The basement, which was nearly not included in the project, has roughly the same area as the previous church hall, while the top hall is significantly larger. The organ was built by Copeman Hart for the church in 1977-79, and was first installed in the old building for a few months before demolition. In 1991, David Jackman resigned to start the Proclamation Trust's Cornhill Training Course. There was a gap of just over five years before Dr. John Balchin was appointed as Senior Minister in January 1997. He retired in 2004 and was succeeded by John Risbridger in September of that year. Paul Webber joined the staff in 2011 (replacing Andrew Page, who stepped down to focus full-time on The Mark Drama), and Tim Sutton, who joined in 2013 (replacing Paul Allcock on his retirement). Tim Sutton moved to be minister of Westward Ho! Baptist Church in September 2016. Paul Webber became the Minister with responsibility for Mission and in September 2019 Chris Webb was appointed to a new role as Minister for Discipleship.

Impact Insurers are primarily distinguished by their intention to address social and environmental challenges through the provision of insurance coverage. For example, criteria to evaluate the positive social and/or environmental outcomes of investments or project that may benefit from insurance coverage are an integrated component of the underwriting processes. Social Impact Insurance can be in the form of insurance including Credit, Marine, Property Damage, Engineering and Construction, Liability, and Life Insurance.

Lafuma is a French based company that specializes in outdoor equipment and clothing, such as backpacks, sleeping bags, and footwear. They also offer a wide variety of other equipment, earning comparisons to United States-based companies such as Patagonia and Columbia Sportswear. Group brands include Eider, Millet and Oxbow. The Lafuma clothing brands have been personified by sport personalities and recently by the French actor and stuntman Karl E. Landler. History The three Lafuma brothers ‚Äì Victor, Alfred and Gabriel ‚Äì founded Lafuma in 1930 producing backpacks. In 1936, the company invented the metal-frame braced backpack, which expanded the group considerably. Having produced products for both the French Army pre-World War II, and during the occupation of France by Nazi Germany for the Wehrmacht, the company resumed production post-war. In 1954 Lafuma expanded into camping furniture. In 1984, the company went bankrupt, and was taken over by a grandson of the founders, Philippe Joffard. In 1985 the company expanded into sleeping bags, and in 1986 moved part of its production to Tunisia. In 1991, the company launched new clothing brands, and in 1992 opened new production facilities in Hungary. This allowed the resumption of the production of brands Millet and Le Chameau in 1995. The company was launched on the CAC Small second market in 1997, reducing the founding-families share to around a 15% share holding. Philippe Joffard remains chairman. In 2004, the company purchased the jeans brand Ober, and in 2005 Oxbow. In 2006, the company began co-branding winter clothing with Thierry Mugler. After a difficult year in 2007, Lafuma resumed production of the Eider brand, but by moving production from √âloise to overseas facilities. In 2012 Le Chameau was sold to Marwyn Management Partners, a UK-based private equity company. Current The group is still highly reliant on the domestic French market, with 60% of group turnover generated from French sales. The current brandlines of the group include (with reported sales percentages): *Lafuma (44.1%) *Oxbow Surfwear (28.2%) *Millet (16.3%) Detailed figures for the licensing of the Killy trademark are not published. Turnover by product is broken down as: *Clothing (62.5%) *Accessories and equipment (12%) including: backpacks, sleeping bags, blankets, billfolds, mountaineering ropes, strollers *Shoes and boots (13.1%) *Camping furniture (12.4%) including: folding chairs, chairs, tables The group has eight production sites, in: France (4); Hungary (1); Tunisia (1); Morocco (1); and China (1).

Plot Roberto Moran (Mariano Mores) has just arrived in Buenos Aires from the provinces to work in a foundry. He can play the bandone√≥n by ear but wants to have proper training in music at a conservatory run by a frustrated old musician, Don Matias (Ricardo Galache). The old man first rejects both Roberto and his instrument, but after hearing him play, he changes his mind and takes him on, though forbidding him to play popular music, which he despises. Roberto becomes a great classical pianist, but as he acquires proficiency, he secretly composes tangos too. One of the best sequences shows him informally playing the Argentine \\"Taquito Militar\\" accompanied by the other students playing their classical instruments (violin, clarinet, harp). Roberto wins a scholarship to go to Europe to further his success as a pianist but he turns it down, preferring to compose \\"music that reveals the soul of the city\\". \\"The day will come,\\" he tells the conductor Aquiles Baldi (Orestes Soriani), \\"when your great orchestra will play this kind of music.\\" A conflict arises with the arrival of factory owner, Francisco Romani (Santiago G√≥mez Cou), a calculating authoritarian who admires the United States. Roberto and Romani are both interested in Isabel (Diana Maggi), the conservatory director's daughter, who is torn between staying with the infatuated young musician who loves her or opting for the affluence of his more mature opponent. At the end of the film the roles are reversed: while Roberto achieves both popular success and the support of the \\"cult\\", showing his old master he can indeed express the \\"voice of the city\\", the entrepreneur is finally revealed to be a worthy suitor, full of feeling, who can succeed in winning the heart of the young woman.

A First World War memorial was erected near the south door in 1921. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) Southampton was bombed heavily and there were direct hits on the parish and much loss of life. Throughout this period the clergy and members of the church kept watch on the church with a stirrup pump, buckets and shovels. The windows were given a coating of a rubber solution to lessen the danger of splintering glass. The neighbouring church of St Barnabas was destroyed in 1940 and the two churches were temporarily merged until the rebuilding of the church at St Barnabas in 1957. In 1941 there was an air raid where incendiary bombs fell near to the church. There was no serious structural damage to the church but windows in both the east and west ends of the church were shattered and the caretaker's quarters were destroyed. Despite the roof requiring 7000 new tiles, the morning matins went ahead. The church replaced those eastern windows that were destroyed in the Blitz and these were the church's memorial to those who died in the Second World War. = Later history = The church celebrated its centenary in September 1947 with services by two previous vicars. Windows on the East side of the church building destroyed during World War Two were replaced in 1952. The church's building had grade II listed building status by 1969.Highfield Church, Southampton: A brief history of the Church and parish Accessed 4 April 2007.  Architecture  The church originally had a nave, a small chancel with clerestory windows, a south aisle, and a tower with a broached oak shingled spire, which contained one bell. The architect was Joshua Brandon, who died before the building was completed and is buried in the churchyard. The walls of the church are of Purbeck Stone with mouldings of Caen Stone and the painted glass windows were created by Nixon and Ward. The church has been built onto and altered many times since it was first built. * In 1852 a parsonage was added and used as a vicarage, * In 1855 the north aisle was added, * In 1863 gas lighting was installed (candles had been used in the church before this time), * In 1869 the chancel was rebuilt, the spire restored, and the windows raised, * In 1885 gas regulators and burners were installed throughout the church, * In 1915 the western extension was built, * In 1921 a First World War memorial was erected near the south door, * In 1955 a west porch was designed by Ernest Berry Webber (who was the architect of the Civic centre of Southampton) and dedicated to Sir Sidney Kimber and his son. * In 2011, the pews were replaced with soft seating and the building renovated and updated  Area  Highfield Church is at the junction of Highfield Lane and Church Lane in the Highfield area of Southampton. Next to the church is the Church Centre, which is used by the church and the community for events, for example, adult education classes. Adjacent to the church is the main Highfield campus of the University of Southampton. The Highfield Church of England School building stands next to Highfield Church.

Early life Born on August 14, 1835 to Venancio Zamora and Hilaria del Rosario, he began his early education in Pandacan and later at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He was classified as a Filipino mestizo under the Spanish caste system prevailing at that time.Guerrero, Le√≥n Mar√≠a. 1998. Something to Remember. The First Filipino. Guerrero Publishing.

This invitation was used by the Spaniards as evidence against Jacinto Zamora. The court accused them of inciting the revolt, even though the evidence was not adequate. They were found guilty and sentenced to death by garrote. The execution was carried out on February 17, 1872 at Bagumbayan Field in Manila. It has been said by the Witnesses that Padre Zamora was disoriented during his last days. As a result, he did not give any last words before the garrote took the life from the young priest.

On December 5, 1975, Sulaiman was unanimously elected president of the WBC and had served in that capacity until the time of his death. Under Sulaiman's leadership, the WBC had instituted many new rules and regulations regarding boxers' safety and welfare. Among the changes was the reduction of world championship bouts from 15 rounds to 12, the official weigh-in taking place 24 hours prior to each bout, the creation of intermediate weight divisions, the creation of the World Medical Congress, the introduction of the attached thumb glove and the funding of brain injury research programs at UCLA.

Dijkstra search algorithm in DRAKON quicksort algorithm in DRAKON-C A DRAKON diagram describing a transportation of a cryonics patient DRAKON is an algorithmic visual programming and modeling language developed within the Buran space project following ergonomic design principles. The language provides a uniform way to represent flowcharts of any complexity that are easy to read and understand. The DRAKON Editor, which was released in September 2011, is an implementation of the language available in the public domain. It can be used for creating documentation, or for creating visual programs that can be converted to source code in other languages. Unlike UML's philosophy, DRAKON's language philosophy is based on being augmented if needed, by using a hybrid language, which can be illustrated as \\"incrustating code snippets from text language used into shape DRAKON requires\\". This way, DRAKON always remains a simple visual language that can be used as an augmentation for a programmer who is interested in making their own project code easier to support or other long-term needs for example improving the ergonomics of the coding process or to making code easier to review and understand. The name DRAKON is the Russian acronym for \\"–î—Ä—É–∂–µ–ª—é–±–Ω—ã–π –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –ê–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π [—è–∑—ã–∫], –ö–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –û–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –ù–∞–≥–ª—è–¥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\", which translates to \\"Friendly Russian algorithmic [language] that illustrates (or provides clarity)\\". The word \\"–Ω–∞–≥–ª—è–¥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" (pronounced approximately as \\"naa-glya-dno- st-th\\") refers to a concept or idea being easy to imagine and understand, and may be translated as \\"clarity\\". The DRAKON language can be used both as a modelling/\\"markup\\" language (which is considered a standalone \\"pure DRAKON\\" program) and as a programming language (as part of a hybrid language). Integration of a stricter, \\"academic\\", variant of a markup language into programming, such as provided by DRAKON, adds syntactic sugar allowing users of different programming languages to comprehend each other's contributions to the overall project and even provide commentary if needed.  History  The development of DRAKON started in 1986 to address the emerging risk of misunderstandings - and subsequent errors - between users of different programming languages in the Russian space program. Its development was directed by Vladimir Parondzhanov with the participation of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Academician Pilyugin Center, Moscow) and Russian Academy of Sciences (Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics). The language was constructed by formalization, ergonomization and nonclassical structurization of flowcharts described in the ISO 5807-85 standard and Russian standard ¬´–ì–æ—Å—Ç 19.701-90¬ª.–û–∫—É–ª–æ–≤–∞ –õ. –ü. –ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∞ –≤ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ —Å —Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –ø–µ–¥–∞–≥–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —ç—Ä–≥–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∏ // –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫. –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞. –ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ ¬´–ò–Ω–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ \\\\ Innowacje i badania naukowe, jak rowniez ich zastosowanie w praktyce. ‚Äî 29.05.2012- 31.05.2012. –í–∞—Ä—à–∞–≤–∞ \\\\ Warszaw¬ª.Parondzhanov V.

The actual real-world experience of building systems with DRAKON remains extremely scarce as only a few very short snippets of code are publicly available.  Family of DRAKON-languages (hybrid languages)  Icons of DRAKON language Macroicons of DRAKON language. DRAKON (; dragon in English) is designed with humanistic ideas in mind, as usage of three different languages for the same project was a source of human factor-related hardships such risks of having a mutual misunderstanding. DRAKON is used not as a single stand-alone language but as a family of hybrid languages, such as DRAKON-C, DRAKON-ASM, DRAKON-Java, etc. All hybrid languages of the DRAKON-family have the uniform graphical syntax, based on flowcharts. The standard graphical syntax provides similarity of drakon-charts for different hybrid languages. The text language used uses its own syntax. Strict distinction of the graphical and textual syntax along with rich graphics improves flexibility and variety of expressive means of the language. The unification of the rules of the graphical syntax in the hybrid languages secures their conceptual unity. The basis of the graphical syntax is a graphical alphabet. Graphical elements (graphical letters) of the DRAKON alphabet are called icons (not symbols). There are 27 icons in the DRAKON graphical alphabet. DRAKON has not only icons, but also macroicons. Macroicons are the graphical words of the DRAKON language. Just as words are made up of letters, macroi—Åons (graphical words) consist of the icons (graphical letters). There are 21 macroicons in the DRAKON language. Icons and macroi—Åons are the building blocks for constructing drakon-charts. The important parts of ma—Åroi—Åons are valence points (in the illustration to the right, they are depicted as little black circles). Into these points, icons or microicons can be successively entered and arranged by drakon-editor in neat, orderly vertical rows.  Design  DRAKON was created as an easy to learn visual language to aid the comprehension of computer programs written in different programming languages for illustrative, planning and strategy purposes. DRAKON uses drakon-chart, which is a formalization of traditional flowcharts to depict the overall structure of the program. Code snippets of a programming language are added to the DRAKON icons. The combination of visual elements with code helps with the creation and maintenance of readable flowcharts alongside the development of the program in question. DRAKON rules for creating diagrams are cognitively optimized for easy comprehension, making it a tool for intelligence augmentation.Bezel Ja. V. Is it possible to improve the workings of the mind?

A set of smaller programs, that together serve the same purpose, are often easier to understand when depicted as drakon-charts. A similar problem exists in maintaining code of large programs. This problem is occasionally referred to as \\"rule of 30 [lines of code]\\" among programmers. = Other Purposes and Uses = While DRAKON is primarily designed as a tool for comprehending computer programs, drakon-charts can also be used to illustrate processes in fields not related to computing. In the DRAKON editor pictures can be added to the DRAKON icons. This ability is used in some fields to easily create \\"flowchart like\\" infographics. In Russia the DRAKON editor is known for being used in the medical field as a tool for making 'instructional' charts for patients or medical personnel.

This state machine has three states \\"playing\\", \\"dropping\\", and \\"finished\\". The game takes different actions depending on the current state. For example, in the \\"playing\\" state, when there is a falling projectile and the projectile can move down, it is moved down one step. With DRAKON, the reader of the algorithm can visually trace all possible paths in the decision tree. { - valign=\\"top\\"  The core logic of the Tetris game in DRAKON-JavaScript language  JavaScript code generated from the DRAKON-chart: function advanceStep() { var _sw_8; _sw_8 = module.state; if (_sw_8 = \\"playing\\") { if (module.projectile) { if (canMoveDown()) { moveDown() return getStepPeriod() } else { freezeProjectile() return noProjectile() } } else { return noProjectile() } } else { if (_sw_8 = \\"dropping\\") { if (canMoveDown()) { moveDown() return DropPeriod } else { freezeProjectile() module.state = \\"playing\\" return getStepPeriod() } } else { if (_sw_8 = \\"finished\\") else { throw new Error(\\"Unexpected Choice value: \\" + _sw_8); } return undefined } } } } = noProjectile = The noProjectile function handles the specific situation when there is no falling projectile. If there is a filled row, that row is removed from the grid. Otherwise, the game tries to insert a new projectile. If there is no space for the projectile, the game is lost. { - valign=\\"top\\"  The noProjectile function for Tetris game in DRAKON-JavaScript language  JavaScript code generated from the DRAKON-chart: function noProjectile() { if (clearRow()) { return getStepPeriod() } else { createProjectile() if (isGameLost()) { gameOver() module.state = \\"finished\\" return undefined } else { return getStepPeriod() } } } } = clearRow = The clearRow function scans all rows bottom-up until it hits a row with no gaps. In such case the row is removed from the grid, the score is increased, and the game's tempo goes up. { - valign=\\"top\\"  The algorithm that removes a line from Tetris grid in DRAKON-JavaScript language  JavaScript code generated from the DRAKON-chart: function clearRow() { var row, rows; rows = module.glass.rows row = rows.length - 1; while (true) { if (row >= 0) { if (rowHasHoles(row)) { row--; } else { deleteRow(row) increaseScore() increaseSpeed() return true } } else { module.addedScore = 0 return false } } } }  Automata-based programming in DRAKON  A DRAKON chart of the silhouette type is a finite automaton. The branches of a silhouette can be interpreted as the states of the automaton. Therefore, one can implement automata-based programming with the DRAKON language.  DRAKON algorithm execution animation  The picture below illustrated the execution of the silhouette DRAKON algorithm. The algorithm execution is animated by highlighting diagram elements in the running order. The 'Fishing' silhouette consists of four trees: * Preparing for fishing. * Waiting for a bite. * Fishing work. * Way back. The main path of each tree is shown by highlighting thick vertical line which is called a skewer. Note that each path from the \\"Fishing\\" Headline icon (start point) to the End icon (stop point) goes smoothly and continuously without any breaks or interruptions. This animation shows that any human can slide his finger along any route from the Headline icon to the End one without lifting his finger (or pencil) from the paper or screen. It means that silhouette control flow graph always has a path from the Headline icon to each vertex (node) of the control flow graph. Consequently, a silhouette can't have unreachable code in any conditions.  Examples of DRAKON-programs and equivalent usual program codes  This section is unfinished (to be done later)  DRAKON Editor  DRAKON Editor is software for making DRAKON flowcharts. It is used for two purposes: documenting algorithms and programming. DRAKON Editor is written in Tcl/Tk and runs on Windows, OS X and Linux. As a documentation tool, DRAKON Editor helps create diagrams that capture algorithmic knowledge. Such knowledge covers both behaviour of computer systems and procedures not directly related to computers, for example medical algorithms and business processes. DRAKON Editor can generate source code from diagrams. This way, DRAKON Editor can be used as an IDE. =Features= The process of editing in DRAKON Editor is based on free drawing. The user inserts and manipulates primitive shapes such as rectangles, vertical and horizontal lines. The user experience is similar to that of business drawing tools. DRAKON Editor does not prevent the user from violating the rules of DRAKON language. It is possible, however, to perform an automated check of the visual syntax at any time. DRAKON Editor has an alternative editing algorithm, called \\"smart mode\\". When in the smart mode, the user can change the visual appearance of the diagram without breaking its topology. In other words, the smart mode allows to fine-tune the layout of the diagram while keeping the underlying algorithm intact. DRAKON Editor supports the following programming languages: * AutoHotKey * C * C++ * C# * D * Erlang * Go * Java * JavaScript * Lua * Processing * Python * Tcl * Verilog For some programming languages, DRAKON Editor generates source code for ERIL data modeling language. DRAKON Editor can also generate source code for finite state machines represented with the silhouette construct of DRAKON language. For Erlang, DRAKON Editor generates boilerplate code from a visual representation of a supervision tree. Thanks to the nature of the free drawing principle, DRAKON Editor can produce other types of diagrams including class diagrams and sequence diagrams.  DRAKON in the German Aerospace Center  DRAKON language is used in the German Aerospace Center for implementation of some critical functions dictated by the safety regulations of the flight tests, where automation is important because of maximum distance to the ground station and the process needs quick automatic execution. The DRAKON Editor software was using to graphically program flowcharts which were specially checked. C-code was generated from the drakon-charts, for instance, for DRAKON representation of launch detection code.  DRAKON language in medical care  The goal of clinical algorithms is to do the right clinical decisions while standardizing and equalizing performance of practitioners. Besides, it improves the quality of health care and minimizes the risk of errors. DRAKON algorithms are ergonomical ones and help to prevent mistakes and ambiguities. DRAKON algorithmic language uniforms medical algorithms and allows complete clinical tasks successfully.

It has an extensive range, from northern KwaZulu-Natal northwards along the east coast and into the southern African interior, and northwards into tropical Africa. Nomenclature E. magalismontanum was at various times in the past known under the names Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum (see: J. C. Bequaert), Pouteria magalismontana and Chrysophyllum magalismontanum. The specific name refers to the Magaliesberg from where the species was first described, and where it commonly occurs. Description This tree is usually known by its Afrikaans name stamvrug (\\"stem fruit\\") which refers to its habit of bearing densely clustered fruit on the trunk and thicker branches (cauliflory), a common feature of this family. The fruit are tasty and sweet with very little pink flesh - they are rich in latex and are leathery-skinned. The seed is large, smooth and hard, and is covered with a soft membrane. Their bisexual flowers are similarly crowded on the trunk and branches, and smell strongly of fermenting honey. Stamvrug trees at maturity may range from 1 metre tall on exposed dip slopes with very limited soil where they are prone to stunting by fire, to about 15 metres in the shelter of kloofs (gorges) with ample water and deep soil. Crowns are densely leafy and rounded, branched almost to the base, with leaves crowded at ends of branches, densely covered in golden-brown velvety hairs below, and often with a whitish indumentum above. Relationships and associated species The species is a larval food plant for the butterfly Pseudacraea boisduvali trimeni. It is closely related to Englerophytum natalense (Sond.) T.D.Penn. and Mimusops zeyheri Sond. and is often found in association with the latter. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae with some 35 genera and 600 odd species, that are mostly trees with leathery, entire leaves. The family is present throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are rich in latex and yield substances like gutta-percha and balat√°.

Biography Catherine was the daughter of the magnate Count Jan Karol Opali≈Ñski and Zofia Czarnkowska. On May 10, 1698 in Krak√≥w she married Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who became Duke of Lorraine and was, briefly, king of Poland (reigned as Stanis≈Çaw I). In 1699, she gave birth to Anna Leszczy≈Ñska, and in 1703, to Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, the future spouse of Louis XV of France. Catherine suffered 20 miscarriages between 1700 and 1720. =Queen= In 1704, her spouse was elected King of Poland after having been supported as a candidate by Charles XII of Sweden, who had at the time placed Poland under his occupation. Between November 1704 and July 1705, Charles XII had his headquarters at Rawicz, and the royal couple held court at Rydzyna Castle nearby, were queen Catherine hosted balls and masquerades for the Swedish power holders and welcomed the wives of the Swedish commanders stationed there, such as for example Christina Piper, who visited Carl Piper in Ravicz and were introduced at the Polish court at the same time.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi [Christina and Carl Piper: a biography], Historiska media, Lund, 2010 (Swedish) =Exile= Queen Catherine was sent by Stanislaw through Gdansk to Stettin in 1708, when the political situation became unstable. In 1709, her spouse was deposed when the Swedish army lost the military upper hand in Poland, and the family was by Charles XII granted refuge in the Swedish city of Kristianstad in Scania, were they arrived in 1711 and stayed for three years.M. Sp√≥rna, P. Wierzbicki: S≈Çownik w≈Çadc√≥w Polski i pretendent√≥w do tronu polskiego. Krak√≥w: Zielona Sowa, 2003, s. 235‚Äì237. . In Sweden, the family was welcomed by the Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora and became popular members of the society life on the estates of the nobility around Kristianstad: one of their acquaintances among the Swedish nobility were Christina Piper, whom they had met in Ravicz in 1705 and with whom they spent several months in Norrk√∂ping in the autumn of 1713.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi [Christina and Carl Piper: a biography], Historiska media, Lund, 2010 (Swedish) In 1712, they also visited Medevi, the spa of the Queen Dowager. In 1714, Charles XII gave them permission to live in the Swedish province of Zweibr√ºcken in Germany, where they were supported by the income of Zweibr√ºcken: they lived there until the death of Charles XII in 1718 Catherine, as well as her daughter queen Marie, maintained a political correspondence with Margareta Gyllenstierna, the spouse of Arvid Horn, with whom she had made the acquaintance during her stay in Sweden.Norrhem, Svante (2007). Kvinnor vid maktens sida : 1632-1772. (Women alongside power: 1632-1772) Lund: Nordic Academic Press. Libris 10428618. (Swedish) After the death of Charles XII in 1718, they lived in Wissembourg in Alsace in France. Their lifestyle in Wissembourg was regarded as very below standard for a royal at that time; they lived in a small house, and could not pay the salary of their small retinue from which a few \\"served as an apology for a guard of honour\\", and the jewels of Catherine were reportedly held as security by a moneylender.Latour, Louis Therese, Princesses Ladies And Salonnieres of The Reign of Louis XV, 1927 Catherine Opali≈Ñska was described at this point as economical but bitter, and her relationship with Stanislaw was reportedly not happy at this point as she felt disappointment over the loss of a royal position and her exile and blamed this on the actions of Stanislaw, in which she was joined by her mother-in-law Anna Leszczy≈Ñska (1660‚Äì1727), who lived with them in exile. =France= In 1725, her daughter Marie was chosen to be the queen of France, which made Catherine mother-in-law to Louis XV of France. After the wedding, Catherine and Stanis≈Çaw resided at the Ch√¢teau de Chambord.Renata Tyszczuk: The Story of an Architect King: Stanislas Leszczynski in Lorraine 1737-1766 They kept their titles and were addressed and treated at the French court as king and queen. In 1733, Stanislaw again took the throne of Poland during the War of the Polish Succession, making her queen of Poland for the second time. He abdicated the throne in 1736, however. Catherine remained in exile in France during his second reign in Poland. In 1737, her spouse was granted the Duchy of Lorraine for life, and settled there as Duke of Lorraine. This made Catherine duchess consort of Lorraine, and she joined him there and settled at the Ducal court in Nancy. Until her death, however, she kept her title of Queen. Catherine suffered from asthma and heart problems, which served as a reason for not attending ceremonial functions, and she was described as a bigot occupied with her \\"obsession\\" of returning to Poland. Michel Caffier, Les Grandes Heures de la Lorraine As long as she lived, Stanis≈Çaw reportedly benefited the Catholic church and the Jesuit order financially.The National Review, Volym 19.W.H. Allen, 1892 In contrast to Stanis≈Çaw, Catherine did not adjust to life in France or Lorraine, but felt a certain bitterness over her exile,Bogdan, Henry: La Lorraine des ducs and continued to long for Poland.Nesta H. Webster: The Chevalier De Boufflers (1916) Catherine Opalinska was described as homely, pious and charitable, but also as a \\"dour\\" personality whom Stanis≈Çaw regarded to be boring.Nesta H. Webster: The Chevalier De Boufflers (1916) As soon as they were installed with their court in Lorraine, Stanis≈Çaw took numerous mistresses, many among her ladies-in-waiting, such as Catherine Ossoli≈Ñska and Anna Maria Ossoli≈Ñska, the Premi√®re dame d'honneur Marie-Louise de Linanges, Madame de Bassompierre and Madame de Cambres, until from 1745 he had a permanent relationship with Marie Fran√ßoise Catherine de Beauvau-Craon, all relationships which Catherine could not prevent.Bogdan, Henry: La Lorraine des ducs =Death= When his mother-in-law, the spouse of the dethroned king of Poland, died in 1747, Louis XV ordered a commemorative ceremony, in her honour at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The ceremony glorified the deceased who underwent a veritable deification. Her tomb is in the church of Notre-Dame-de- Bonsecours, in Nancy, next to her husband and the heart of their daughter.

Some versions rely on the development of a simulated reality, a proposed technology that would be able to convince its inhabitants that the simulation was \\"real\\". The simulation hypothesis bears a close resemblance to various other skeptical scenarios from throughout the history of philosophy. The hypothesis was popularized in its current form by Nick Bostrom. The suggestion that such a hypothesis is compatible with all of our perceptual experiences is thought to have significant epistemological consequences in the form of philosophical skepticism. Versions of the hypothesis have also been featured in science fiction, appearing as a central plot device in many stories and films. Origins There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion. This skeptical hypothesis can be traced back to antiquity; for example, to the \\"Butterfly Dream\\" of Zhuangzi, or the Indian philosophy of Maya, or in Ancient Greek philosophy Anaxarchus and Monimus likened existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.Sextus Empiricus Against the Logicians 1.88 A version of the hypothesis was also theorised as a part of a philosophical argument by Ren√© Descartes. Simulation hypothesis Nick Bostrom's premise: Nick Bostrom's conclusion: Nick Bostrom in 2014 =The simulation argument= In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed a trilemma that he called \\"the simulation argument\\". Despite the name, Bostrom's \\"simulation argument\\" does not directly argue that we live in a simulation; instead, Bostrom's trilemma argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true: # \\"The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero\\", or # \\"The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running simulations of their evolutionary history, or variations thereof, is very close to zero\\", or # \\"The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.\\" The trilemma points out that a technologically mature \\"posthuman\\" civilization would have enormous computing power; if even a tiny percentage of them were to run \\"ancestor simulations\\" (that is, \\"high-fidelity\\" simulations of ancestral life that would be indistinguishable from reality to the simulated ancestor), the total number of simulated ancestors, or \\"Sims\\", in the universe (or multiverse, if it exists) would greatly exceed the total number of actual ancestors. Bostrom goes on to use a type of anthropic reasoning to claim that, if the third proposition is the one of those three that is true, and almost all people with our kind of experiences live in simulations, then we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Bostrom claims his argument goes beyond the classical ancient \\"skeptical hypothesis\\", claiming that \\"...we have interesting empirical reasons to believe that a certain disjunctive claim about the world is true\\", the third of the three disjunctive propositions being that we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Thus, Bostrom, and writers in agreement with Bostrom such as David Chalmers, argue there might be empirical reasons for the \\"simulation hypothesis\\", and that therefore the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis but rather a \\"metaphysical hypothesis\\". Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument as to which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: \\"If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility #n that obtains.' But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true.\\" As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that \\"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.\\"The Simulation Argument Website FAQThe Simulation Argument: Why the Probability that You Are Living in a Matrix is Quite High, Nick Bostrom, Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University, 2003Davis J. Chalmers The Matrix as Metaphysics Dept of Philosophy, U. o Arizona; paper written for the philosophy section of The Matrix website. =Criticism of Bostrom's anthropic reasoning= Bostrom argues that if \\"the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one\\", then it follows that we probably live in a simulation. Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps \\"Sims\\" do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim. Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting \\"neural ancestor simulations\\" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's \\"ancestor simulations\\", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non- simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation. Some scholars categorically reject‚Äîor are uninterested in‚Äîanthropic reasoning, dismissing it as \\"merely philosophical\\", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific. Some critics propose that we could be in the first generation, and all the simulated people that will one day be created do not yet exist. The cosmologist Sean M. Carroll argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if a civilization is capable of performing simulations, then it will likely perform many simulations, which implies that we are most likely at the lowest level of simulation (from which point one's impression will be that it is impossible to perform a simulation), which contradicts the arguer's assumption that it is easy for us to foresee that advanced civilizations can most likely perform simulations. =Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis= Simulation down to molecular level of very small sample of matter Some scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that we live in a simulation) is false. Physicist Paul Davies deploys Bostrom's trilemma as part of one possible argument against a near- infinite multiverse. This argument runs as follows: if there were a near- infinite multiverse, there would be posthuman civilizations running ancestor simulations, and therefore we would come to the untenable and scientifically self-defeating conclusion that we live in a simulation; therefore, by reductio ad absurdum, existing multiverse theories are likely false. (Unlike Bostrom and Chalmers, Davies (among others) considers the simulation hypothesis to be self-defeating.) Some point out that there is currently no proof of technology which would facilitate the existence of sufficiently high-fidelity ancestor simulation. Additionally, there is no proof that it is physically possible or feasible for a posthuman civilization to create such a simulation, and therefore for the present, the first proposition must be true. Additionally there are limits of computation. Consequences of living in a simulation Economist Robin Hanson argues a self-interested high-fidelity Sim should strive to be entertaining and praiseworthy in order to avoid being turned off or being shunted into a non-conscious low-fidelity part of the simulation. Hanson additionally speculates that someone who is aware that he might be a Sim might care less about others and live more for today: \\"your motivation to save for retirement, or to help the poor in Ethiopia, might be muted by realizing that in your simulation, you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia.\\" Testing the hypothesis physically A method to test one type of simulation hypothesis was proposed in 2012 in a joint paper by physicists Silas R. Beane from the University of Bonn (now at the University of Washington, Seattle), and Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage from the University of Washington, Seattle. Under the assumption of finite computational resources, the simulation of the universe would be performed by dividing the continuum space-time into a discrete set of points. In analogy with the mini-simulations that lattice-gauge theorists run today to build up nuclei from the underlying theory of strong interactions (known as quantum chromodynamics), several observational consequences of a grid-like space-time have been studied in their work. Among proposed signatures is an anisotropy in the distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, that, if observed, would be consistent with the simulation hypothesis according to these physicists. In 2017, Campbell et al. proposed several experiments aimed at testing the simulation hypothesis in their paper \\"On Testing the Simulation Theory\\". In 2019, philosopher Preston Greene suggested that it may be best not to find out if we're living in a simulation since, if it were found to be true, such knowing may end the simulation. Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in metaphysics and epistemology. David Chalmers has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their mental lives are governed by the physics of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics). They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically caused. Chalmers argues that this means that Cartesian dualism is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it. In popular culture The first to state the basic concept of reality as a simulation was Plato in 380BCE, in the famous Allegory of the Cave, describing people imprisoned since childhood (but not since birth) led to believe that artificial light-based representations of reality were truly real when, in fact, they were a fabricated illusion. =Science fiction themes= Science fiction has highlighted themes such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer gaming for more than fifty years. Simulacron-3 (1964) by Daniel F. Galouye (alternative title: Counterfeit World) tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes, in which the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world. The book was made into a German made-for-TV film called World on a Wire (1973) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The movie The Thirteenth Floor (1999) was also loosely based on this book. \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" is a short story by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in April 1966, and was the basis for Total Recall (1990 film) and Total Recall (2012 film). In Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, a 1983 television movie, the main character pays to have his mind connected to a simulation. The 1993 Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Ship in a Bottle\\" explores the idea of people being unaware they are living in simulation, with Picard postulating at the end that perhaps they are also in a simulation playing out in a box on a table. This is also a possible use of dramatic irony, with both the actors and audience aware the television programme is indeed a simulation of sorts. The same theme was repeated in the 1999 film The Matrix, which depicted a world in which artificially intelligent robots enslaved humanity within a simulation set in the contemporary world. The 2012 play World of Wires was partially inspired by the Bostrom essay on the simulation hypothesis. In the episode \\"Extremis\\" (broadcast on 20 May 2017 on BBC One) of the science fiction series Doctor Who, aliens called \\"The Monks\\" plan an invasion of Earth by running and studying a holographic simulation of Earth with conscious inhabitants. When the virtual Doctor finds out about the simulation he sends an email about the simulation to his real self so that the real Doctor can save the world. In the first season of Rick and Morty, a science-fiction animated comedy, the episode \\"M. Night Shaym-Aliens!\\" (2014) aliens trap the lead role (Rick) in a simulated reality in order to trick him into revealing his formula for concentrated dark matter. The hypothesis also serves as the climax of No Man's Sky's overarching plot, in which it was revealed that the game's setting itself was a simulation and that the player character is a member of a race made to explore it. In the game Xenoblade Chronicles, it is revealed that the whole world of the gods Bionis and Mechonis was a simulation run by Alvis, the administrative computer of a phase transition experiment facility (heavily implied to be \\"Ontos\\" in Xenoblade Chronicles 2) after Klaus destroyed the universe in a multiverse experiment.

The brigade administered the regular infantry regiments of Yorkshire, England. After the Second World War there were 14 infantry depots in Britain, each bearing a letter. The depots were territorially organised, and Infantry Depot E at Catterick was the headquarters for six line county regiments recruiting in Yorkshire and Northumberland. In 1948, the depots adopted names and this depot became the Yorkshire and Northumberland Brigade, with all regiments being reduced to a single battalion at the same time.

This led to the Yorkshire and Northumberland Brigade being renamed as simply the Yorkshire Brigade.Merged regiments and new brigading - many famous units to lose separate identity, The Times, July 25, 1957 As part of the 1958 reforms, all regiments in the Brigade adopted a common cap badge depicting a crowned white rose above a scroll inscribed \\"Yorkshire\\".A L Kipling and H L King, Head-dress badges of the British Army, Volume 2, London, 1979 Regimental collar badges continued to be worn.

It was released on Creation Records in 1999. The song was written by frontman/bassist Pete Vuckovic and recorded at Westside Studios in London. It surprised many, showing a more sensitive and epic side to the band's previously punk/pop-dominated sound (although their debut album featured 'Fit Boy and Faint Girl' and 'Copper Girl' which were both in a similar vein). It went on to become the band's biggest commercial hit, reaching number 11 in the UK charts in January 1999, throwing them further into the media spotlight at a time when the talk surrounding the band was of them being dropped. It also paved the way for the band's American campaign where the song received considerable radio airplay, even entering the charts. The band toured the US with Silverchair, and Vuckovic subsequently did an acoustic promotional tour of radio stations on the back of the song's success. It was later perhaps incorrectly and naively blamed for splitting the band up, having allegedly distanced Vuckovic from his bandmates and fuelled a creative power struggle between him and his co-writer, Chris McCormack. However, the band reformed three years later and went on to play the song at every gig. The video for the song can be found on youtube.com where it has currently enjoyed 6 times as many 'hits' as anything else the band recorded or released, and played a massive part in procuring the band the opening slot at Wembley Stadium in 1999 (opening for Aerosmith). 'Beautiful Day' was later used on Channel 4's 2003 dating show Boys & Girls. The song was also used in the USA Network show White Collar ‚Äì it can be heard in the background inside the beach house in the episode 'Hard Sell'.

It lies in the Sz√©kely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. It is composed of a single village, Mere»ôti. Its elevation is .  History  The village is likely to have been formed from 7 small settlements in the 13th century: Varjas, Kak√≥d, Benesfalva, Alm√°s, Benc≈ëfalva, Cikefalva, Tank√≥falva. It was first recorded in 1333 when a sacerdos de Almas was mentioned. In 1808, its name appears as Alm√°s, in Romanian Poiana Marului. Before World War I, its Romanian name was also Homorod-Alma≈ü≈ü.Transylvanian Toponym Book In 1762, the villagers refused to perform military service, therefore, as a retaliation a company of the Atlhan cavalry regiment was stationed and housed in the village. In the 19th century, the village became a famous center of manufacturing of painted furniture. The village was part of the Sz√©kely Land region of the historical Transylvania province. It belonged to Udvarhelysz√©k district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the village became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County. Demographics At the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 1,339; out of them, 97% were Hungarian, 0.4% were Roma and 0.4% were Romanian.Tab8.

The order is named for the shape of the cell walls (or valves or frustules) of pennate diatoms, which are elongated in valve view. The valves may be linear or oval in shape, and usually bear bilaterally symmetrical ornamental patterns. These patterns are composed of a series of transverse lines (known as striae) that can appear as rows of dots when viewed with an optical microscope. Some pennate diatoms also exhibit a fissure along their longitudinal axis. This is known as a raphe, and is involved in gliding movements made by diatom cells; motile diatoms always possess a raphe. In terms of cell cycle, vegetative cells are diploid and undergo mitosis during normal cell division. Periodically, meiosis produces morphologically identical haploid gametes (isogametes), which fuse to produce a (sometimes binucleate) zygote that develops into an auxospore (from which full-sized vegetative cells are produced). In some taxonomic schemes, the pennate diatoms are divided into two groups: pennate diatoms without a raphe, known as araphids (order Fragilariophyceae), and pennate diatoms with a raphe, known as raphids (order Bacillariophyceae).

In 2010 it was removed from the Charity Commission's register, and it is now hosted by the Child Poverty Action Group. Objects * Inform the public about the causes and effects of child poverty * Forge a commitment between and across the public, private and voluntary sectors to end child poverty by 2020 * Promote the case for ending child poverty by 2020 with this and every future Government. Activities The coalition involves children, young people and parents with experience of poverty and others in a wide range of activities, such as a children's poetry anthology, a children Queen's speech and in lobbying the Chancellor and Government Ministers. The coalition has also organised cross- sector events such as the National Poverty Hearing, held on Wednesday 6 December 2006 working with Church Action on Poverty, Age Concern, Help the Aged, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Oxfam, Poverty Alliance, Refugee Council, Shelter and the UK Coalition Against Poverty. The event engaged senior politicians, policy makers and opinion formers in the media and public life and grassroots anti-poverty/civil society groups from across the United Kingdom. From the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17 until Universal Children‚Äôs Day on November 20 End Child Poverty led a Month of Action to call attention to the millions of children in poverty and demand action; calling on the Government to place child poverty firmly at the centre of their agenda and asking the chancellor to ‚Äòplay ball!‚Äô to deliver, in the Comprehensive Spending Review, the resources needed to end child poverty, once and for all.

During the late 1950s many cooperative galleries along Ninth and Tenth Street in New York City's East Village showcased the work of young artists. The painters and sculptors showcased there were among the avant-garde of the day. According to some sources, one of the earliest of the postwar New York \\"shaped canvas\\" paintings, by Edward Clark, was shown at the Brata in 1957.

The picture stars Edwige Fenech, Luigi Pistilli, and Anita Strindberg. The film uses many elements from Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story \\"The Black Cat\\" and acknowledges this influence in the film's opening credits. Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key was Martino's fourth giallo film. The title of the film is a reference to his first one, The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh (Lo strano vizio della Signora Wardh, 1971), in which the killer leaves the phrase as a note to his victim. The victim in that film was played by Fenech. The film has been released under several alternate titles, including Gently Before She Dies, Eye of the Black Cat and Excite Me!. Plot Oliviero Rouvigny, a failed writer and an alcoholic, lives in a crumbling mansion with his wife Irina, who is scared of Oliviero's cat, Satan, that used to belong to his late mother Esther. The only other main resident is the black maid, Brenda. To fight boredom, Oliviero organizes decadent parties for local hippies and humiliates and abuses Irina in front of the guests. A key early plot-point is the elegant gown that belonged to Rouvigny's dead mother that he catches Irina wearing which angers him. After his mistress Fausta, a young student and bookstore employee, is found murdered, Oliviero becomes the primary suspect after being fingered by Fausta's boss Bartello. The author lies when questioned by police and tells them that he was fixing a flat tire on his car during the time Fausta was murdered and forces Irina to cover for him. Later, Irina investigates the supposed flat tire in the boot of her husbands car but he catches her and angrily beats her. During the night during a heavy thunder storm, Brenda puts on Esther's gown and is silently watched by Oliviero. Brenda senses someone else is in the house and attempts to flee to her room but is mortally wounded by the still-unseen killer with a bill-hook. Irina finds the dying Brenda who collapses at her feet. Oliviero appears and coldly views the body and convinces Irina to help him conceal it to avoid further suspicions. Brenda's body is buried in the cellar, although Oliviero refuses to dispose of the blood-stained gown with the body and tells Irina to wash it. Then Oliviero's niece Floriana suddenly arrives for a visit from Paris. A sinister gray-haired man also appears and seems to watch the Rouvigny's from afar. Later at the house, the same gray-haired man shows up and gives Irina a dry-cleaning package containing the gown. Oliviero flies into a rage after believing his wife sent the dress out to be cleaned and beats her and locks her in a closet where Satan claws Irina. Floriana finds her aunt in the closet and frees her. Irina finds comfort in Floriana's arms and bed, and the two decide to find a way to deal with Oliviero. The same night, the killer strikes again and murders a local prostitute named Giovanna, who had coincidentally arrived in town the same day Floriana appeared. The girl's aunt/madame kills the attacker. The following day, the police inspector reveals to Oliviero that the serial killer was none other than the book store manager Bartello, who was really an escaped mental patient named Lipori. Rouvigny tells his wife this and attempts to strangle her. Floriana, meanwhile, has began a relationship with the local milkman Dario, who previously dated Brenda. Following attending a dirt-bike race in which Dario competes but is forced to drop-out of due to his bike failing, Floriana is taken by Dario to an old barn where they make love while Oliviero secretly spies on them. Irina catches Satan after the cat kills several of her pet doves and in a angry rage stabs one of the cats eyes out with a pair of scissors. This is witnessed by the elderly woman who collects bottles from the house and she is ordered to leave by a crazed- looking Irina who rushes into the house and collapses. Later Oliviero enters Floriana's room and finds her laying in bed in his mother's gown. Floriana reveals she knew that her uncle spied on her when she bedded Dario in the barn loft and then proceeds to seduce Oliviero. The next morning, Oliviero confronts Irina about his missing cat and questions why she bought new scissors. The elderly woman, Mrs. Molinar, visits the town and asks to speak to the Chief of Police regarding the Rouvigny's. Oliviero, Floriana, and Irina visit a mountaintop scenic view and the two women discuss killing Oliviero by pushing him over the cliff. That night, Irina is awakened by the sound of Satan's wailing outside. She goes to the room of Floriana and overhears her niece and Oliviero discussing her and Oliviero mentions he has made space in the cellar for his wife's body. Irina rushes outside and sees Dario secretly meeting with Floriana and asking her to meet him in the morning. Irina spies Satan and chases him into the cellar where she discovers that Brenda's corpse has been uncovered, giving credence to Oliviero's murderous plans. Irina approaches Olivero, passed out next to his typewriter and violently stabs him to death with the scissors. Following the murder, Floriana reveals she watched but indicates that Irina will surely go to prison unless she covers up the murder. Floriana reveals that she has been after the jewelry that Oliviero had stashed in the mansion. Irina humbly gives her the jewelry and the two sleep together one final time before Floriana departs in the morning. The gray- haired man, Walter, sneaks into the house in the early morning hours and begins writing on Oliviero's type writer \\"vendetta\\" repeatably before escaping as Irina and Floriana investigate. Disturbed by these events, Floriana abandons Irina and rushes out to meet Dario. Walter appears and its discovered is the secret-lover to Irina, who goes to the cellar. Irina reveals that it was she who killed Esther as well as Brenda. The original scheme was to convince Oliviero he was Brenda's killer and drive him mad, however his own plans to murder Irina and bed Floriana forced a change of plan. Walter kills both Floriana and Dario by throwing oil on the road as they attempt to escape on motorbike, making it look like an accident so he can recover the family jewels. Later, Irina pushes Walter off a cliff to have the jewelry all for herself. When Irina returns to the mansion, she finds the police there. Mrs. Molinar, the old woman, had filed a complaint for animal cruelty, as she had seen Irina stabbing Satan. Inside the mansion, the police officers notice that the cat seems to be mewing in agony inside a wall. As they tear down the wall, they discover the cat and the dead body of Oliviero inside.

It is named after the German chemist Eduard Zintl who investigated them in the 1930s,S.M. Kauzlarich, Encyclopedia of Inorganic chemistry, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, with the term \\"Zintl Phases\\" first used by Laves in 1941. Zintl phases are a subgroup of brittle, high-melting intermetallic compounds which are diamagnetic or exhibit temperature-independent paramagnetism, and are poor conductors or semiconductors.Sevov, S.C., Zintl Phases in Intermetallic Compounds, Principles and Practice: Progress, Westbrook, J.H.; *Freisher, R.L.: Eds.; John Wiley & Sons. Ltd., Chichester, England, 2002, pp. 113-132 Slavi Chapter Zintl noted that there was an atomic volume contraction when these compounds were formed and realised this could indicate cation formation. He suggested that the structures of Zintl phases were ionic, where there was complete electron transfer from the more electropositive metal. The structure of the anion (nowadays called the Zintl ion) should then be considered on the basis of the resulting electronic state. These ideas were further developed to become the Zintl rule or Zintl Klemm concept, where the polyanion structure should be similar to an isoelectronic element. Polyanions Zintl phases are polyanionic compounds. Their structure can be understood by a formal electron transfer from the electropositive metal to the more electronegative element. Thus, the valence-electron concentration (VEC) of the element is increased and it formally moves to the right in the periodic system of elements. Generally, the formed anion does not reach an electron-octet. To compensate the lack of electrons, element-element bonds are formed. The structure can be explained by the 8-N rule (replacing the number of valence electrons N by VEC) and is thus similar to an iso-valence electronic element. The formed polyanions can be chains (one-dimensional), two- or three-dimensional networks or molecule-like entities (i.e. Si44--tetrahedra in KSi). =Zintl ions= Zintl phases that contain molecule-like polyanions are often soluble in liquid-ammonia, ethylenediamine, crown ethers or cryptand solutions. Therefore, they are referred to as (naked) Zintl ions. While extended networks are typical for electron rich anions, the isolated species are often found on the more electron poor side. The structures do not resemble pseudo-elemental configurations but can be described as clusters by Wade's rules. Examples Structure of [As7]3- subunit in the Zintl phase Cs2NaAs7. Diamondoid framework of Tl‚àí ions in NaTl. ‚Ä¢ NaTl consists of a polyanion (‚ÄîTl‚àí‚Äî)n with a covalent diamond structure. Na+ ions are located between the anions. Concept: Tl‚àí ~ C. ‚Ä¢ NaSi: the polyanion is tetrahedral (Si4)4‚àí, similar to P4. Concept: Si‚àí ~ P. ‚Ä¢ Na2Tl: the polyanion is tetrahedral (Tl4)8‚àí, similar to P4. Concept: Tl2- ~ P. ‚Ä¢ Cs2NaAs7: the trianion adopts the structure of P4S3. Concept: As‚àí ~ S. ‚Ä¢ K12Si17: there are two types of Zintl ions: 2x Si44- (pseudo P4, or according to Wade's rules, 12 = 2n + 4 skeletal-electrons corresponding to a _nido_ -form of a trigonal-bipyramid) and 1x Si94- (according to Wade's rules, 22 = 2n + 4 skeletal-electrons corresponding to a _nido_ -form of a bicapped square-antiprims) Zintl line The Zintl line is a hypothetical boundary drawn between group 13 and group 14, to highlight the tendency for group 13 metals to form phases with a variety of stoichiometries, which contrasts to group 14 and above that tend to form salts with polymeric anions. It is now recognised that some Zintl phases contain Zintl clusters and that this accounts for the variable stoichiometries. The bonding in many of these clusters cannot be accounted for by classical octet rule involving covalent, 2-centre, 2-electron bonds, as implied by the Zintl rule. The reaction of Ge, Sn or Pb and Na in liquid NH3 in the presence of ethylene diamine (en) gives the Zintl cluster Na4en7Sn9. Hydrides Zintl phases can incorporate hydrogen. Such Zintl phase hydrides< can be either formed by direct synthesis of the elements or element hydrides in a hydrogen atmosphere or by a hydrogenation reaction of a pristine Zintl phase. Since Hydrogen has a comparable electronegativity as the post-transition metal it is incorporated as part of the polyanionic patial structure. There are two structural motifs present. A monoatomic hydride can be formed occupying an interstitial site that is coordinated by cations exclusively (Interstitial hydride). Furthermore, hydrogen can bind covalently to the polyanion (polyanionic hydride). Exceptions There are examples of a new class of compounds that, on the basis of their chemical formulae, would appear to be Zintl phases, e.g., K8In11, which is metallic and paramagnetic. Molecular orbital calculations have shown that the anion is (In11)7‚àí and that the extra electron is distributed over the cations and, possibly, the anion antibonding orbitals.

Life =Studies and early career= He was the son of the entrepreneur and benefactor Christakis Zografos, from Qestorat, (Lunxh√´ri) in the Gjirokast√´r prefecture. Christakis-Zografos studied in Paris and in Munich law and political science. When he returned in Greece, he was involved in agricultural reforms especially according to the large fields his father possessed in Thessaly. During this period he supported the concept that the large feudal estates (called cifliks during the period) of the region should be expropriated and redistributed to those who owned no land. He sold to non- land owners much of his agricultural fields in extremely low prices. =1905‚Äì1913= In 1905, he was elected to the Greek Parliament for the Karditsa prefecture. In 1909, he served as Foreign Minister under Dimitrios Rallis. After the First Balkan War, he was appointed Governor General of newly liberated from the Greek Army Epirus region. Christakis-Zografos served as Governor General of Epirus from March 29 (March 16 OS), 1913 until December 31 (December 18 OS) of the same year. =Head of the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus= When the Great Powers decided to award Northern Epirus to Albania, local Greeks formed a provisional government under Christakis- Zografos on February 28, 1914 and declared their autonomy the following day in Gjirokast√´r. Zografos sent a note to each of the representatives of the Great Powers explaining the eminent situation:Pyrrhus Ruches. Albanian historical folksongs, 1716-1943: a survey of oral epic poetry from southern Albania, with original texts. Argonaut, 1967 p. 104-105. > Under these conditions and in the absence of a solution that would suffice > to safeguard Epirus, a solution would have been otherwise so easy to > discover, the Epirote populace is forced to declare to the Powers that it > cannot submit to their decision.

After a three months period of armed conflicts, the European Powers intervened and asked for negotiations on a new basis. On May 17 the state of Northern Epirus was internationally recognized by the Protocol of Corfu, as an autonomous region inside the borders of Albania. However, this state was short lived and on October 27, when World War I broke out and the Albanian government collapsed, the Greek army re-entered the area with the sanction of the Great Powers. =1914‚Äì1920= Christakis-Zografos after the second Greek administration in the area, returned to Greece and was elected at the following elections. He resigned his office at December 1914. A little while later he became executive of the National Bank of Greece, position he retained until September 1917, with a short-term interval (February 25-August 10, 1915) when he became for second time Minister of Foreign Affairs under the cabinet of Dimitrios Gounaris. He supported the entrance Greece on the side of the Triple Entente during World War I, foreseeing that this strategic move could offer to the country several advantages. He retired in 1917 and died three years later from a longtime heart ailment. Legacy During the Communist regime in Albania (1945‚Äì1992), Georgios Christakis-Zografos and his father Christakis Zografos (notable benefactor and entrepreneur), were stigmatised as 'enemies of the state'. Anyone from his home town who held the name 'Zografos' (whether relatives or not), was therefore persecuted. After 1992 however, the situation has changed. Today, the Zografeio school in Qestorati, founded by his father, has been renovated and has reopened as a museum.http://hal.archives- ouvertes.fr/docs/00/16/57/25/PDF/de_Rapper_2005a.pdf ...were stigmatised in Albanian historiography as shovinist√´ and borgjez√´ (chauvinist, bourgeois) who had worked to destroy the Albanian nation by pretending that all Orthodox Christians were Greek or should be Greek, and by supporting the opening of Greek schools in Lunxh√´ri and elsewhere.

It lies in the Sz√©kely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. The commune is composed of three villages: *CrƒÉciunel / Kar√°csonyfalva *Ocland / Okl√°nd *Satu Nou / Homor√≥d√∫jfalu  History  Ocland was first recorded in 1546 as Akland, and in 1550 as Okland.Transylvanian Toponym Book The name Kar√°csonyfalva was first recorded in 1333 in a tithe register when a priest of Karachni was mentioned. In 1453, reference was made of Peter, son of Michael, of Karachonfalwa. Its Romanian name derives from the Hungarian and historically it was CrƒÉciunfƒÉleni.Transylvanian Toponym Book The name of Homor√≥d√∫jfalu was first recorded in 1481 in the form of Wijfalw, in 1861 it was called officially Homor√≥d-Ujfalu. The Romanian name was originally Homorod-UifalƒÉu which was changed to the current official form after World War I. The villages were part of the Sz√©kely Land region of the historical Transylvania province. They belonged to Udvarhelysz√©k district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when they fell within the Homor√≥d district of Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. Okl√°nd was the district seat until after World War II. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune officially became part of Romania again in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, and between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô- Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the autonomous region was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County. Demographics The commune has a Hungarian (Sz√©kely) majority. According to the 2011 census, it has a population of 1,257 which 98.41% or 1,237 are Hungarian.  Landmarks  =Ocland= *The ramparts of the watchtower of a Roman castrum, called by locals as Hagym√°s castle, can still be seen in the saddle of the Mogyor√≥s and Szilas creeks. * The Kustaly Castle is located east of the village. It was built in the 11th - 12th centuries as part of the Hungarian border defence system. * The Unitarian church of the village is from the Romanesque era and was altered around the turn of the 15th to 16th century in late Gothic style. It received its current form by the constructions works made in 1938. =CrƒÉciunel= * The Unitarian Church. Medieval fresco scenes cover 100 square meters and show the legend of Ladislaus I of Hungary, the birth of Jesus, the homage of the Three Kings, Empress Saint Helen. It has a unique coffered ceiling, painted furniture, sanctuary dating from the √Årp√°d Dynasty of medieval Hungary. The church was already mentioned in 1333. The construction of the gate on the southern side and the enlargement of the windows are thought to have been made in the 14th century. The western gate decorated with a relief representing the Agnus Dei was built in 1496 at the same time with the robust church tower. A Sz√©kely runic inscriptions was found in the wall of the tower. The meaning of the old Hungarian script is still not definitely solved. *The monument of Queen Elisabeth of Hungary was erected outside the wall of the Unitarian church in 1904. *The Roman Catholic church was built in the 18th century, its altar, however, is from the 17th century and it is thought to preserve components from the pre-Reformation era.

They are similar to the Centrales, a traditional, paraphyletic subdivision of the heterokont algae known as diatoms. The order is named for the shape of the cell walls (or valves or frustules) of centric diatoms, which are circular or ellipsoid in valve view. The valves often bear radially symmetrical ornamental patterns that can appear as dots when viewed with an optical microscope. Some also bear spines on their valves, which may either increase cell surface area and reduce sinking, or act as a deterrent to zooplankton grazers. Unlike pennate diatoms, centric diatoms never have a raphe. In terms of cell cycle, vegetative cells are diploid and undergo mitosis during normal cell division. In sexual species, oogamous meiosis produces haploid gametes, either ova or sperm cells. These fuse to produce a zygote which expands in size to develop into an auxospore from which full-sized vegetative cells are produced. In some taxonomy schemes, the centric diatoms are known instead as order Coscinodiscophyceae, and in some schemes as order Biddulphiales. However, diatom taxonomy is changing due to the development of new molecular and genetical analysis tools.

There are two public houses, The Golden Pheasant and The Smoker. Plumley railway station is on the Mid-Cheshire Line and has regular services to Manchester and Chester. Plumley salt cavities In 1949, following a study carried out in 1947, the ICI Company was commissioned by the Ministry of Fuel and Power to develop a small salt cavity in the ICI Brinefield at Holford near Plumley. It was constructed by leaching out brine and designed to be able to hold approximately 5,000 cubic metres of petroleum. It was filled with gas oil and regularly tested for any deterioration in the quality of the product. The location for the possible salt cavity site was ideal as it was close to the Stanlow Refinery, a number of existing petroleum storage depots and the government pipeline network. In 1951 the government decided to build 34 full-sized cavities. They were designed to hold approximately 1.2 million tons of petroleum product giving the site a capacity approximately six times greater than any of the existing government storage depots. The Ministry of Fuel and Power therefore purchased approximately 200 acres of suitable land from ICI near Plumley. ICI were contracted to excavate the salt cavities while Shell was contracted to carry out all the other associated engineering works. These were extensive and included all the necessary ancillary facilities, connecting the Plumley site to the existing pipeline system, to the Shell refinery at Stanlow and to a new storage depot to be built at Goostrey. Following the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Ministry of Power decided that the storage capacity at Plumley should be doubled. This was achieved by increasing the volume of each cavity. Work started in January 1959, but could only progress quite slowly as each cavity had to be emptied of product and then leached out and was not completed until July 1963. The government required that all oil refineries in this country had to keep 90 days' supply of crude oil in Great Britain. To meet that requirement, a number of oil companies stored crude oil in the salt cavities at Plumley. However, they had to enter into an exchange deal with Shell, as the only refinery that could easily use the crude oil was Shell Stanlow. There were also problems with operations at Plumley in the build-up of sludge from the crude oil in the cavities. It was found that sludge was building up at a rate that increased with the movement in and out of the cavities. Therefore the cavities hired by Shell and the most frequently used for the Stanlow refinery had the largest accumulation of sludge. A second problem with the cavities used for the storage of crude oil was that the extraction rate, at 7,200 cubic metres per day, was too slow. A system for the removal of fuel from the cavities at a much higher flow-rate of around 25,000 cubic metres per day had been installed as part of the original design. This involved the use of two water-pumping stations at Acton Bridge on the River Weaver connected to Plumley by two water mains. This system, however, could only be used in an emergency as it would wash out some of the cavity until after two such operations it would fail. During the 1970s the use of the salt cavities declined. In 1975 and 1976 the Department of Energy, at the insistence of the Treasury, considerably increased the charges for the use of Plumley. However, this resulted in three of the oil companies removing their product from the cavities leading to a dramatic drop in income. Around 1980 BNOC, who managed Plumley on behalf of the DoE, concluded that approximately ¬£500,000 would need to be spent over a two-year period to keep it operational. In the early 1980s, as the DoE no longer required the storage of civil ground fuels for use in an emergency, the salt cavities were emptied of product, although they were retained as an asset for possible future usage.Government Pipeline and Storage System Capacity Study June 1984 p.5 See also *Listed buildings in Plumley References External links Category:Villages in Cheshire Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire ","title":"Plumley"},{"id":"9913151","text":"Andr√© Cibelli Abujamra (born May 15, 1965) is a Brazilian score composer, musician, singer, guitarist, actor, and comedian of Lebanese and Italian origin.

Its author remains uncertain, since it was written under the pseudonym of \\"Stephen Junius Brutus\\". Likely candidates for its authorship include Hubert Languet and Philippe de Mornay. In 1931, Gerardina Tjaberta van Ysselsteyn conjectured that the tract was a collaboration between Languet and de Mornay. The work proceeds through four questions concerning the response of the people to their king. The first two questions are treated briskly and concern whether a people are bound to obey or are able to resist their king when he breaks the divine law. The third and longest question considers whether the people can resist a king on the grounds that he is destroying the commonwealth. The answer to each of these questions is an affirmative. The work is interesting for the grounds that it gives a justification for popular resistance. The work merges the theological view of covenant with the legal understanding of contract to show why resistance can be justified in the eyes of the law. However, it stops short of inviting any individual to judge a king. Rather, individuals could only take up arms if they are led by an inferior magistrate (so termed to distinguish them from the superior magistrate, i.e., the king). This shows considerable restraint in the wake of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and in comparison to other Reformed thinkers such as Christopher Goodman and John Knox. The fourth question considers whether foreign princes can legally support a popular rising against a king on the conditions set out in the first three questions.

It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62√ó39mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet in such a way that ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War. The S4M was succeeded by a less powerful, but otherwise fairly similar, MSP using the newer SP-3 ammunition in 7.62√ó39mm, which also used in the NRS knife.Maxim Popenker (2008), Special purpose small arms ammunition of USSR and Russia ; updated version of an article first appeared in the March 2005 issue of The Cartridge Researcher, the Journal of ECRA (the European Cartridge Research Association) See also * Derringer *PSS Silent Pistol *TKB-506 *List of Russian weaponry References External links * S4M silent pistol at Modern Firearms Category:Pistols of the Soviet Union Category:Insurgency weapons Category:Multiple barrel firearms Category:7.62 mm firearms ","title":"S4M"},{"id":"9913183","title":"ARM Cement Limited"},{"id":"9913185","text":"William McKee, CBE (1952-2018) was a former and founding chief executive of the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.

Although not featuring any of Wodehouse's regular characters, the cast contains a typical Wodehousian selection of English aristocrats, wealthy Americans, household staff and imposters. Plot summary Wealthy New York businessman G. Ellery Cobbold has sent his son Stanwood, a blundering ex- American football player, to London, to separate him from Hollywood starlet Eileen Stoker with whom he is in love. When Cobbold discovers that Stoker is also in London, making pictures, he insists that Stanwood goes to stay with a distant relation, curmudgeonly widower Lord Shortlands. But Stanwood stays put. Instead, good-looking movie agent Mike Cardinal goes to Shortlands' castle (Beevor, in Kent), posing as Stanwood. He is pursuing Shortlands' beautiful daughter Terry. But Terry is wary of him because he is too handsome. Lord Shortlands himself is in love with his cook, Mrs Punter, and would like to marry her. Unfortunately she insists on ¬£200 to buy a pub, which Shortlands doesn't have, the purse-strings at Beevor Castle being firmly in the control of his domineering elder daughter Adela. Also, he has a rival in suave butler Mervyn Spink. Things look up for \\"Shorty\\" when he discovers that a stamp in his collection is worth ¬£1000. But Spink fools Adela into believing that the stamp is his, and it gets locked up in a safe. It so happens that Stanwood's butler, Augustus Robb is an ex-safe breaker, and Mike masterminds a burglary. This goes disastrously wrong, and Mike gets hit in the face with a bag of safe breaking tools. The up-side is that his battered face makes him suddenly attractive to Terry. So, after a final misunderstanding, things end happily for Mike and Terry. Stanwood and Eileen also get together. But Mrs Punter runs off with Augustus Robb, leaving Shorty and Spink ruing their loss in love but bound in their increased fortunes; Spink is a big winner in a horse race and Shorty has been invited to live with Mike and Terry in Hollywood, away from Adela, where the savvy Mike has assured him he can make a handsome income by appearing in movies as a character actor of butlers. Background According to Wodehouse scholar Norman Murphy, the novel's Beevor Castle closely resembles a real castle, Hever Castle. Hever Castle is not far from Fairlawne, where Wodehouse's daughter Leonora lived after she married. Publication history The illustration on the first US edition dust jacket was by Paul Galdone, and the photograph of Wodehouse on the back was by Ray Platnick. The illustration on the first UK edition dust jacket was by Frank Ford. According to Richard Usborne's book Wodehouse at Work to the End, Wodehouse adapted Spring Fever into a play for Edward Everett Horton with an American setting and characters. Horton was unable to use the play because of other commitments, so Wodehouse turned the play into a new novel, The Old Reliable (1951). The story was published in one issue of the Toronto Star Weekly, on 9 October 1948. Spring Fever was included in the book Five Complete Novels, a collection of Wodehouse novels published on 15 May 1983 by Avenel Books, New York. The book also included The Return of Jeeves, Bertie Wooster Sees It Through, The Butler Did It, and The Old Reliable.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 126‚Äì127, B26.

Political life Abdoulaye Wade later became active as leader of the Senegalese Democratic Party in opposition. Following the 1993 presidential election, in which Wade was defeated, there was some political unrest in the country and the vice president of the Constitutional Court, Babacar Seye, was assassinated. Both Abdoulaye and Viviane were arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of involvement. Those charges were later dropped, and three other people were sentenced for the murder. Following her husband's election as President of Senegal in 2000, Viviane became First Lady. After the end of her husband's Presidency, she closed down the Acting for Education and Health foundation and made the staff redundant. The couple relocated from Senegal to Paris. Following the imprisonment of her son, Karim, on corruption charges, she supported his claims of innocence and suggested that the charges were politically motivated. Wade had been with the former President in Versailles when the charges were announced. Prior to the trial, she made weekly trips from Paris to Dakar to visit her son; she had been staying in France to look after his three daughters due to the death of their mother. Wade attended all the sessions of his trial, while her husband did not in order not to lend legitimacy to the proceedings.

Ashby was born in Somerville, Massachusetts and started playing guitar when he was nine. His career started in 1940 when he became a member of Lionel Hampton's band, and he played on Hampton's hit \\"Flying Home\\". In 1947, he took over for Oscar Moore in the Nat King Cole Trio. He then briefly replaced Charlie Smith, a drummer, in the Oscar Peterson Trio, producing a lineup (piano, guitar, bass) similar to the Cole Trio's; the substitution of a guitarist for a drummer continued until 1958. After leaving the Peterson Trio, Ashby concentrated on session work, which included recording with Norman Granz, Sheb Wooley, LaVern Baker, Howard Roberts, B.B. King, Louis Jordan, and Pat Boone. In addition to guitar, Ashby played the upright bass. Ashby died in April 1987 in Perris, California, at the age of 66.

The novel is set during a future history of South Africa, following the ascension of Afrikaner nationalists and their increasingly destructive quest for total apartheid. It foreshadowed the fall of Jan Christiaan Smuts and his United Party administration, a rupture in ties with the British Commonwealth, and the declaration of a Second South African Republic. Presiding over the regime which follows is Obadja Bult, a dominion theologian influenced by the ideals of the former Ossewabrandwag. His blunt authoritarian streak gives spark to racial conflict‚Äîculminating in foreign intervention and troubled majority rule. Background As World War II draws to a close, white politics in the Union of South Africa are glaringly polarised - reflecting the struggle between Daniel Malan's Reunited National Party, whose followers demand a republic, and the United Party of Jan Smuts, who wish to retain their British monarch. Smuts' outstanding electoral victory in 1943 is fast becoming a distant memory; the Nationalists have consolidated by 1948 and go on to win Calvinia, Potchefstroom, Springs, and Caledon. United Prime Minister Oudstryder dissolves parliament in 1952, the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's landing at the Cape of Good Hope. His Nationalist rivals take advantage of the occasion, organising a massive pageant in Cape Town. Speeches, processions, and gatherings mushroom at famous battlefields. British imperialism is decried as the national enemy. A wave of Afrikaner patriotism rocks South Africa as the polls are opened: Oudstryder and his pro-English colleagues are doomed. The triumphant Nationalists return 83 seats against the United Party's 56, securing a majority in every province but Natal. Accuracy of predictions The book correctly predicted the end of the long tenure in power of the United Party of Jan Smuts and the rise to power of the National Party, followed by a rupture with the British Commonwealth and the proclamation of a second \\"South African Republic\\". In Keppel-Jones' prediction, however, the National Party institutes a totalitarian fascist- style dictatorship and completely suppresses all dissent‚Äîto a far greater degree than the actual apartheid government was to implement even in its most repressive phases. Keppel-Jones further predicts a mass exodus of South Africa's British diaspora; an uprising led by the Zulus, which is suppressed with much bloodshed; a constant state of overt and guerrilla warfare; a totally intransigent attitude by the Afrikaner leadership leading to increasing tensions with the rest of the world, culminating with an international military intervention‚Äîwhich leads to the toppling of the regime, followed by the killing or expulsion of the remaining white population, much of it migrating to Argentina; and an economic collapse and social degeneration, with the inexperienced and incompetent new government proving unable to maintain the political and economic structures which were handed over to them by the international community. Researcher Gary Baines compared the book's deeply pessimistic message and its looking forwards to a disastrous future to the tone of J.M. Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians several decades later in 1982.Gary Baines, \\"Revisiting Urban African Policy and the Reforms of the Smuts Government, 1939-48\\", Workshop on South Africa in the 1940s, Southern African Research Centre, Kingston, September 2003 Bibliography * Keppel-Jones, Arthur.

Instead of radial piston engines used by the Douglas design, Canadair used Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engines to achieve a higher cruising speed of compared with the of the standard DC-4. Requested by TCA in 1944, the prototype flew on 15 July 1946. The type was used by various airlines and by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). It proved to be reliable but noisy when in service through the 1950s and into the 1960s. Some examples continued to fly into the 1970s, converted to cargo aircraft. Design and development Canadair Aircraft Ltd. took over the Canadian Vickers Ltd. operations on 11 November 1944. Besides the existing Consolidated PBY Canso flying patrol boats in production, a development contract to produce a new variant of the Douglas DC-4 transport was still in effect. The new Canadair DC-4M powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines mounted in Rolls-Royce Universal Power Plant (UPP) installations emerged in 1946 as the \\"North Star.\\" More than just an engine swap, the North Star had the Douglas DC-6 nose, landing gear and fuselage shortened by , DC-4 empennage, rear fuselage, flaps and wing tips, C-54 middle fuselage sections, wing centre- and outer-wing panels, cabin pressurisation, a standardised cockpit layout and a different electrical system. Canadair built 71 examples of what was officially called the Canadair Four under the designations: North Star, DC-4M, C-4 and C-5. With the exception of the single C-5 (which had Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engines, as fitted to the Douglas DC-6), these variants were all powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and 51 of the production examples were pressurised. Operational history Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Canadian Pacific Airlines (CPA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) were the principal operators of the \\"North Star\\", with the CPA examples known as the \\"Canadair Four\\" and BOAC examples known as the \\"Argonaut\\". =RCAF service= The RCAF North Stars were unpressurized and were used on a variety of transport duties. Like other North Stars, they were notorious for the high level of cabin noise caused by the Merlin engines, as unlike the radials of the DC-4, the exhaust from the individual cylinders is not collected and exhausted via a single outlet, but instead exits the separate individual ejector-exhaust stubs in high-pressure bursts. RCAF C-5 North Star In an effort to reduce cabin noise, the sole C-5 variant was powered by Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engines that were considerably quieter.\\"Canadair North Star 1 ST.\\" Canada Aviation Museum. Retrieved: 18 March 2011. The only C-5 was delivered to the RCAF in 1950, entering service with No. 412 Transport Squadron RCAF in Uplands, Ottawa, specially outfitted for the transportation of VIP passengers. It was used to transport the Canadian Prime Minister, the Queen, and numerous other dignitaries on various high-profile missions, serving faithfully for 17 years, later becoming a crew trainer before being retired and sold in the United States. North Stars were also employed by 412 Squadron RCAF on various VIP transport duties and, overall, the aircraft provided valuable and reliable long range transport services for the RCAF. From 1950 to 1952, during the Korean War, RCAF North Star aircraft were employed ferrying supplies to Korea across the Pacific Ocean. They flew 599 round trips over the Pacific and delivered seven million pounds of cargo and 13,000 personnel on return trips. They flew 1.9 million miles without a fatal crash and outhauled the United States Air Force C-54s on the Korean run. After 1967, the remaining North Stars were assigned to No. 426 Transport Squadron RCAF initially deployed to Dorval, Quebec and then to Trenton, Ontario. Gradually, their service life diminished in the 1970s and most were declared surplus. =TCA and BOAC operations= TCA North Star at London Airport (Heathrow) in 1951 An ex TCA DC-4M-2 North Star of Overseas Aviation at Prestwick in 1960 TCA received its fleet of twenty DC-4M-2 North Stars during 1947 and 1948 and operated them on routes within Canada and to the USA until 1961. Starting in 1954 the North Stars were replaced on TCA's routes to Europe by Lockheed Super Constellations. To deal with passenger complaints about noise, TCA engineers developed a cross-over for the fuselage- side exhausts that reduced cabin noise by 6-8 decibels.Aviation Week 7 Sept 1953 p53: \\"Crossovers reduce cabin noise level in the audio range by about 6-8 decibels.\\" \\"In the cabin, noise is reduced to 102 decibels near the windows and 93 at the aisle.\\"American Aviation 12 May 1952 p28 BOAC ordered 22 DC-4M-4s and named them the \\"Argonaut class\\", each aircraft having a classical name beginning with \\"A\\". The Argonauts were delivered between March and November 1949; they flew to South America, Africa, the Middle East and the Far East from London Heathrow Airport until 1960. On 1 February 1952 the BOAC Argonaut Atalanta G-ALHK transported Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh to Kenya to begin a Commonwealth tour.\\"King and Queen See Royal Departure\\", BBC TV (first broadcast) 1 February 1952 BBC Archive Some days later, 6 February, it was again Atalanta G-ALHK which returned the newly acceded Queen Elizabeth II to England upon the death of her father, King George VI.\\"Queen Elizabeth II dressed in mourning descends the steps of the plane that returned her from Africa to London. Prince Phillip is five steps behind\\" San Francisco Sentinel Rolls-Royce also developed a quieter 'cross- over' exhaust system for the DC-4M, the modifications being supplied in a kit allowing installation on the aircraft by the operator. The engine thus modified became the 'Merlin TMO' in contrast to the unmodified engine, the Merlin TML - Transport Merlin L. The modified exhaust conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of 38 hp, resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels. Still air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. BOAC Argonauts initially, due to schedules being unable to be changed, had only the inner engines so-modified, the remaining outer engines being changed to the new exhaust system when time was available.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%200532.html =Later service= After service with TCA and BOAC, the surplused North Stars and Argonauts had long careers with secondary operators such as British Midland Airways, Overseas Aviation and other charter companies. Cargo conversions of available airframes also lengthened the service life of Argonauts and North Stars.CF-UXA, ex-RCAF 17510 was the last DC-4M in airline service, completing its final flight on 19 June 1975 at Miami, Florida. Despite the onset of jet airliners in the 1950s, the rugged Canadair North Star found a niche in both military and civil use.Milberry 1982, pp. 213‚Äì214.

On 9 December 1956: Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810 crashed into Mount Slesse on a flight from Vancouver to Calgary, killing all 62 people on board the aircraft. Among the dead were five Canadian Football League players, including four members of the Saskatchewan Roughriders and one member of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, as well as a CFL official returning home from the previous day's annual All-Star game at Empire Stadium in Vancouver. On 11 October 1966, CF-TFM/HP925 crashed near Garoua, Cameroons, carrying spurious registration I-ACOA, believed to be carrying a cargo of machine guns bound for Burundi. Ex- Overseas Aviation, bought at Gatwick by Mike Keegan, it had been ferried to Coventry for onward sale; under new ownership, flown to Newcastle (UK), with a subsequent long-term stay parked adjacent to the wooden control tower and subject to a restraining Court Order. Eventually re- registered in Panamanian markings, it was flown to Limburg, Netherlands, but ended up being involved in various arms shipment flights to West Africa. After the accident, the movements of this aircraft were investigated and extensively reported by, it is thought, the Sunday Times newspaper.

Unlike his brother, Emperor Maximilian II, Charles was a religious Catholic and promoted the Counter-Reformation, e.g. by inviting the Jesuits to his territory. However, in 1572, he had to make significant concessions to the Inner Austrian Estates in the Religious Pacifications of Graz, and 1578 and the Libellum of Bruck. In practice, this resulted in tolerance towards Protestantism. As the Inner Austrian line had to bear the major burden of the wars against the Turks, the fortress of Karlstadt/Karlovac in Croatia was founded in 1579 and named after him. Charles is also remembered as a benefactor of the arts and sciences. In particular, the composer Orlando di Lasso was one of his prot√©g√©s, as was the music theorist Lodovico Zacconi. In 1573, Charles founded the Akademisches Gymnasium in Graz, the oldest secondary school in Styria. In 1580, Charles founded a stud for horses of Andalusian origin in Lipica, Slovenia, thereby playing a leading role in the creation of the Lipizzan breed. In 1585, Charles founded the University of Graz, which is named Karl-Franzens-Universit√§t after him. He died at Graz in 1590. Charles' mausoleum in Seckau Abbey, in which other members of the Habsburg family are also buried, is one of the most important edifices of the early Baroque in the South-Eastern Alps. It was built from 1587 onwards by Alessandro de Verda and completed by Sebastiano Carlone by 1612.  Marriage and children  In Vienna on 26 August 1571 Charles married his niece Maria Anna of Bavaria. They had fifteen children: * Ferdinand (b. Judenburg, 15 July 1572 ‚Äì d. Judenburg, 3 August 1572). * Anne (b. Graz, 16 August 1573 ‚Äì d.

Since Singapore's independence in 1965, the Singapore deaf community has had to adapt to many linguistic changes. Today, the local deaf community recognises Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture. SgSL is influenced by Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL), American Sign Language (ASL), Signing Exact English (SEE-II) and locally developed signs. The total number of deaf clients registered with The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf), an organisation that advocates equal opportunity for the deaf, is 5756, as of 2014. Among which, only about one-third stated their knowledge of Sign Language.  History of sign language in Singapore  = 1950s - Beginnings = The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf) aims to assist the deaf to achieve a better quality of life and to enable them to integrate and contribute to society. The history of sign language in Singapore can be traced back to 1951 when Peng Tsu Ying left China for Singapore to teach deaf children in their homes. Born in Shanghai, Peng became deaf at the age of 6, and was educated in Hong Kong School for the Deaf (now known as Chun Tok School) and Shanghai Chung Wah School for the Deaf. With Peng's education background in Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) and together with a group of Chinese merchants, in March 1954, the Singapore Chinese Sign School for the deaf was opened. At that time, Singapore was predominantly Chinese and many diverse varieties were spoken. Peng and his wife, also deaf, used SSL in the sign school to teach children to read in Chinese and other subjects at the primary level. During the same period in the early 1950s, the Singapore Red Cross began conducting oral classes for deaf children and provided counselling services for parents of deaf children. As the demand for classes increased, the Singapore Red Cross Society and officials of the Social Welfare Department founded The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf) (then known as Singapore Deaf and Dumb Association) in 1955. It was in 1963 when the sign school and the oral school merged to become the Singapore School for the Deaf (SSD). Within the same premises, students in the oral section of the school were taught in English as the medium of instruction, while students in the signing section of the school were taught in Chinese, with SSL as the medium of instruction. = 1966 ‚Äì Bilingual policy = The bilingual education policy, which came into effect in 1966, marked a linguistic transition for Singapore. The policy places English as the main medium of instruction. Since English became the language of instruction in the education sector, parents could choose education through any one of the four official languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) but all students also had to study English, in non-English-medium schools. The government then required all schools to teach Math and Science in English starting at primary one. This policy is significant to the local deaf community because it has marked a change in educating the deaf. Singapore, once under colonial rule, had been influenced by the British in learning English through the oral method. Furthermore, mainstream education in Singapore was moving towards English education and schools were beginning to switch to English as a medium of instruction. This posed a dilemma to the deaf community because the oral method was not suited to every student. While parents wanted their children to learn English, they have been learning SSL, which was associated with written Chinese. = 1970s = Lim Chin Heng, a former student under Peng, went to the United States of America (USA) to learn English and their sign system, the American Sign Language (ASL). While studying, Lim also got to know some of the professors and authors in USA who were developing a sign system to teach English specifically, called Signing Exact English (SEE-II). Lim became the first Singaporean to enter Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C, an American university for the deaf. He graduated in with a degree in Mathematics, returned to Singapore and introduced ASL to the deaf community by 1974. Written English was known to be associated with ASL because ASL has seen the fewest generational breaks and was well-transmitted as compared to European counterparts. The international deaf community looked up to America as having a strong tradition in protecting their deaf and deaf rights. Hence, ASL was adopted to teach English as a medium of instruction to the deaf because it was seen as the best sign language to learn English. In 1976, SADeaf invited Frances M. Parsons, then an associate professor at the Gallaudet University to promote Total Communication. Total Communication is a philosophy which uses signs, speech, gestures, speech reading, amplification, finger spelling, and/ or other mode of communication to provide linguistic input to deaf children. In the same year, Lim also brought back SEE-II to the local deaf community. By 1977, the Total Communication approach was fully implemented in SSD. Lim also taught basic ASL classes for teachers and eventually ASL was taught to students in SSD. By 1978, SEE-II was adopted as the mode of communication and instruction by SADeaf in its affiliated schools, in SSD and Vocational School for the Handicapped (now known as Mountbatten Vocational School). However, the sign section of SSD, which used SSL, was phased out in 1983 because there were gradually fewer parents who opted for a Chinese education for their deaf children. In 1985, SADeaf joined the World Federation of the Deaf. = 2000s = The term Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) was coined by Andrew Tay in 2008. Tay emphasised the importance of SgSL in the deaf community to help deaf people develop their self-esteem, self-confidence, cognitive power as well as recognise their deaf identity. = Present = Today, sign language used in Singapore is a continually developing blend of Shanghainese, American and locally generated signs. It comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, Pidgin Signed English (PSE) and gestures. SgSL is socially recognised and accepted by the deaf community in Singapore, and is a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture.  Language and sign systems used in Singapore  While Singapore does not have a national sign language, the local deaf community recognises Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as Singapore's native sign language. This is because sign language in Singapore has developed over the last 6 decades since the setting up of the first school for local deaf in 1954. Hence, there is crucial need to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s. Various sign languages have been adopted and used by the local deaf community as a result of linguistic changes. SgSL is influenced by Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL), American Sign Language (ASL), Signing Exact English (SEE-II) and locally developed signs. It also comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, Pidgin Signed English (PSE) and gestures. Today, SgSL consists of the following language and sign systems: = Language systems =  Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL)   American Sign Language (ASL)   Pidgin Signed English (PSE)  Pidgin Signed English (PSE) is a variety or style of language that arises from contact between natural sign language (in this case being SgSL) and the surrounding spoken language, or between different sign languages. It involves the use of SgSL following the spoken English Language word order with simplified or reduced grammar. The use of PSE also occurs when there is contact between two sign languages. In this instance, foreign signs borrowing, code switching, fingerspelling, mouthing, and mixed systems are used. = Sign system =  Signed Exact English (SEE-II)  SEE-II is a Manually Coded English system. It is a sign system that English Language visual through the hands. It was developed in 1969 in Southern California, USA with the aim of teaching deaf children English. About 75% to 80% of SEE-II signs are either borrowed from ASL or modified ASL signs. Unlike ASL, SEE-II is not a language but merely a mode of communication.  Current approaches to deaf education  = Oral approach = Children with hearing impairments receive education through the oral approach method at Canossian School (or CS; it was formerly known as Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired). The Directory of Services for the Disabled states that students at CS are taught using the Natural Auditory-Oral Philosophy, which emphasises the use of audition. Teaching is done without any form of signs or sign language. Hearing-impaired pupils in general public schools access the school curriculum through speech, in the same environment like their hearing classmates. The technological progress and development of hearing aids and cochlear implants allow hearing-impaired children to participate in class. Additional therapy programmes provided by schools and other specialised institutions, as in the case of CSHI with their Audio Verbal Therapy (AVT) or the Listen and Talk programme at the Singapore General Hospital, aim to improve performance of hearing-impaired children in a beneficial setting. The Listen and Talk Programme uses the Auditory-Verbal approach, which helps children access speech and language primarily through auditory input. It allows to integrate affected children in mainstream schools so that their hearing classmates function as important language models in their learning process. = Sign approach = American Sign Language (ASL) was introduced to Singapore's deaf community by Lim Chin Heng, in 1974. Lim Chin Heng was instructed by Peng Tsu Ying and additionally studied English and ASL at Gallaudet University in the United States. During that period, mainstream education in Singapore shifted from a diverse to a uniform language teaching system. English was promoted as the language of instruction in Singaporean schools, and therefore ASL served as a medium of instruction. ASL is still used in Singapore today. Signing Exact English (SEE-II) is not a language itself but a sign coded version of English, meaning it utilises the vocabulary of ASL with the English grammar.  Challenges  Sign language is often viewed as subordinate to spoken language. For both adults and children within the deaf community, this perception, to some extent, leads to them becoming unable to learn sign language, which negatively impacts them socially. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing Federation of Singapore acknowledges that sign language is not the popular choice to educate the deaf population, but it is of good benefit for parents to expose their deaf children to both sign and oral language. = Local Observations = It is difficult to determine if a bilingual (native sign language and English) education program for the deaf in Singapore would be beneficial, since little is known about their language. There is a lack of government documentation that recognises a native sign language in Singapore, thus there is also not much regulation in place to monitor how useful sign language is for Singaporeans and its deaf population; it is a continuing process in improving its application. In Singapore, no one has been able to identify a language that is native of the deaf population, although the public would say that the deaf use \\"sign language\\" to communicate. This \\"sign language\\", Signing Exact English (SEE-II), is not a sign language, but a Manually Coded English sign system. While the SEE-II system is continually being used to help deaf people improve their grasp of English, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) is evolving as another method for them to communicate. And both of these systems pose challenges to establishing sign language as a standard in Singapore. = Challenges facing Signing Exact English (SEE-II) = The use of SEE-II to educate Singaporean deaf children and even adults, is an ongoing issue. This is because most of the deaf population in Singapore are not raised in English-speaking homes. Thus, parents have a difficulty learning sign language because these classes are conducted only in English and SEE-II. The idea behind these systems is that Deaf children will learn English better if they are exposed, visually through signs, to the grammatical features of English. However, exposure to them does not always provide children with the complete linguistic access, which is needed to internalise the whole language. So, there needs to be a better way for parents with hearing-impaired children to effectively communicate with them. On the other hand, if this concern with SEE-II is left unaddressed, more parents may choose to not educate their sons and/or daughters using SEE-II or sign language. = Challenges facing Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) = There is a need to standardise the use of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) based on cultural elements. Language instruction of Signing Exact English for the Deaf does not get used when they are amongst themselves in the deaf community. Despite SEE-II being adopted as the language of instruction among deaf children in Singapore since 1977, and its use as a system of communication in the Deaf community in Singapore, it is of utmost importance to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the Deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s. With Singapore Sign Language (SgSL), depending on the background of the Deaf, local signs of SgSL often are invented and used by them, and they are not necessarily formally and officially indexed. This is a concern such that essentially, the SgSL language lends itself to many ambiguities when it comes to its expression. Additionally, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) has not gone through any form of linguistic research/study; this is because of a lack in government resources and funding. This basically means that it is hard to rely on the deaf population to provide updates on the local vocabularies and sign systems of SgSL, and poses an even greater obstacle for the Sign Language Interpreting community in gaining a better handle on and about the language itself. Currently, the Linguistic Sub-Committee at the Singapore Association does exciting research into SgSL for the Deaf (SADeaf). They aim to set up a sign bank to record locally developed signs and also to better understand SgSL so as to create resources for the general public as well as members of the Deaf community. They are trying to progress in the research of SgSL in order to lead to corpus development. And out of corpus development, the aim is to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of the sign language. This, however, will take a long time to happen, for this is still in the beginning stages; this is the case because the matter is highly complex in Singapore.  Moving forward  The Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) Week 2014, in conjunction with the International Week for the Deaf, is a platform for the local deaf community to promote the awareness of SgSL and Deaf culture. The Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) linguistics sub-committee has been formed to perform research on SgSL that will eventually lead to corpus development, which will be used to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of SgSL. The committee is currently in its second term. Plans have also been made to start a preschool that focuses on language acquisition. In addition, SADeaf organises carnivals and exhibition with its partners to reach out and promote public understanding of deafness and awareness of deaf people in the society. SADeaf has recently organised SgSL Week 2014, from 22 to 28 September 2014, in conjunction with International Week for the Deaf. The theme for International Week for the Deaf is ‚ÄúStrengthening Human Diversity‚Äù. The SgSL Week is a platform for the local deaf community to stand proud as Deaf, and to promote the awareness of SgSL and Deaf culture. Based on the situation in Singapore, there are further recommendations that may be made in order for Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) to progress further, and establish itself in a more prominent sense. More hearing people in Singapore will need to be educated in SgSL, learn it and the manual alphabet to provide more communication and social interaction between deaf and the hearing populations alike. What has been recognised is the need to give every deaf child as early as possible in his/her life as much language education as possible through whatever communication input best suits the child's learning aptitude.

Supported by Unionists, the document affirmed the acceptance of the Compromise as a final resolution of the sectional slavery issues while declaring that no further assaults on Southern rights by the North would be acceptable. The Platform had political significance throughout the South. In the short term it was an effective antidote to secession, but in the long run it contributed to sectional solidarity and the demise of the Second Party System in the South. Much of the document was written by Charles J. Jenkins, a Whig lawyer and state legislator from Augusta.  Background  Sectional tensions over the issue of the westward expansion of slavery, previously resolved by the Missouri Compromise, were reawakened with the debate over Texas Annexation and the Mexican War. Texas Annexation was the major issue in the national elections of 1844, but, despite some signs of a sectional split, the election was resolved along the established party lines. Opposition to the Mexican War and, especially, opposition to acquiring new territory, also split largely along party lines. It was only with the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso in August 1846 that the national debate began to split along sectional lines. During the \\"prolonged deadlock of 1846-50\\" the idea of secession as a possible solution to Northern threats against slavery began to take root among more and more Southerners.Potter p. 122. Potter claimed (page 123) that as late as 1846, Southerners generally associated disunion with treason. In December 1849 Congressman Alexander Stephens, the future vice-president of the Confederacy, wrote to his brother, \\"I find the feeling among the Southern members for a dissolution of the Union ‚Äì if the antislavery [measures] should be pressed to extremity ‚Äì is becoming more general than at first.\\"Potter p. 124 In the United States Congress the issues dividing North and South were debated ferociously, leading to the Compromise of 1850 that was intended to address all outstanding issues relating to slavery. After an early failure to pass a single omnibus bill, in September 1850 President Millard Fillmore signed the five separate bills that made up the compromise. Around the same time, radicals within the South pursued their own solution, leading to the Nashville Convention in June 1850 that some hoped would become a secessionist convention. The convention denounced the proposed compromise, but rejected secession over any territorial restrictions on slavery in favor of extending the Missouri Compromise line to the west coast. Unionists versus Southern Rights Parties Secessionist strength was strongest in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. In the first three of these states there arose local Union or Constitutional Parties to counter the radical Southern Rights parties which were forming. In South Carolina the Southern Rights agenda was already the dominant force in the state, and its leaders were already pressing the other states for secession. The new Union parties attracted the overwhelming majority of Whigs in the three states. In Alabama and Mississippi the Whigs had been weak, and the creation of the Union parties revitalized the opposition to the dominant state Democratic Parties.Cooper p. 304‚Äì305.Huston p. 284. In Alabama, the state divided along sectional lines. In the north of the state the pro-compromise Union Party had its greatest strength while Democrats in the south organized the Southern Rights Party.Cooper p. 306. In Mississippi, Governor John Quitman and Jefferson Davis led the Southern rights group, while Senator Henry S. Foote, who had lost status in the state over his support for the compromise, was the most visible face of the Union Party. Georgia had a strong Whig Party led by Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs. They had already led a Whig revolt against President Zachary Taylor although they ended up supporting the compromise (although both voted against the bill abolishing the slave trade in the District of Columbia). They were joined in their state efforts to form the Constitutional Union Party by moderate Democrat Howell Cobb. Their opposition came from Democratic Governor George Towns and Hershel V. Johnson and fellow Whig John M. Berrien.Davis p. 57.Holt p. 612.Potter p. 126. After the final approval of the bills making up the Compromise of 1850, the radicals acted. In Mississippi, Governor Quitman called for a special legislative session in November to discuss the state's reaction to the compromise. The Nashville Convention reconvened in November, but it was poorly attended and accomplished nothing. In South Carolina, there was already a regular legislative session scheduled for November, and Governor Whitemarsh Seabrook was persuaded not to take any special actions that might evoke the memories of South Carolina extremism during the Nullification Crisis.Potter p. 125‚Äì126. However, the most significant action would occur in Georgia.  Georgia Acts  Governor Towns of Georgia, acting under the instructions of the state legislature, called for a special election to a state convention. The convention, scheduled for November, was intended to determine the appropriate response to the Compromise of 1850. Robert Barnwell Rhett from South Carolina and William Lowndes Yancey from Alabama joined local Georgians in supporting the Southern Rights party to the \\"extent of ruining the state Democratic Party\\". Stephens, Toombs, and Cobb traversed the state in opposition with Stephens alone estimating that he traveled over 3,000 miles in the campaign.Davis p. 57‚Äì60. Unionists outpolled their opponents by 46,000 to 24,000 in the election to the convention, which included a 10 to 1 ratio of delegates committed against secession. Stephens and Toombs were delegates to the convention and used it to officially organize the state Constitutional Union Party. Meanwhile, in Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina the Georgia election results, along with the inaction of the Nashville Convention, put a damper on secessionists.Potter p. 126.Davis p. 58. The task of the convention became the creation of a position that both supported the Compromise of 1850 as the final solution to the sectional disputes over slavery while maintaining a strong position for protecting traditional Southern rights. They did this by approving what came to be known as the Georgia Platform. The document in full is as follows: In a very neat package, the platform offered support for both union and compromise, identified specific future violations of southern rights which would not be tolerated, and kept alive the possibility of secession as a future remedy. Many Southerners felt that the Compromise of 1850 had been shaped more towards Northern interests; the Georgia Platform made it clear that the future of the nation depended on the North strictly adhering to the Compromise.  Repercussions  Mississippi and Alabama joined Georgia in embracing the Georgia Platform. As a political ploy, the Platform thoroughly undermined any effective response from the Southern Rights parties. Generally the Compromise was popular throughout the South, and historian William J. Cooper Jr. made the point that, \\"Although the confrontation was not in fact a union-disunion one anywhere, the successful Unionist onslaught made it seem like one.\\"Cooper p. 308‚Äì309. Historian David Potter stated that the Georgia Platform \\"became the cornerstone of southern policy for several years.\\"Potter p. 128. The state elections of 1851 reflected the popularity of the Unionist position. In Georgia, Cobb was elected governor, Stephens was reelected to the House of Representatives, and Toombs was appointed to the United States Senate. In Mississippi, Foote defeated Jefferson Davis for the United States Senate seat. In the elections to the House of Representatives, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi returned 14 Unionists and only 5 Southern Rights candidates. In the rest of the South, the Whigs generally gained seats in Congress.Cooper p. 310. In South Carolina, there was basically only one political party, and it was divided between those advocating that South Carolina act alone and those that wanted action only in cooperation with other states. The South Carolina legislature called for both a state convention and another Southern Congress in early 1852 in Memphis. However the election turnout for the convention was very light, and the victories of Unionists elsewhere ensured that the Memphis convention never occurred.Craven p. 268. The Union Parties, despite the hopes and efforts of Stephens and others, did not become a national party. Cooper wrote: Ultimately the very success of the Georgia Platform meant that it soon became a basic part of Democratic Party policy. Neither the isolated Union Parties nor the remaining Whigs in other states were able to offer an effective counter to the Democrats who now appeared to offer the best protection for Southern rights.Cooper p. 317 This contributed to the dissolution of the Second Party System within the South.

Arthur, and directed by Edward Sedgwick. Based on the 1925 play of the same name by Vincent Lawrence, this was the second film starring Haines and Crawford, and their first onscreen romantic teaming. Spring Fever was remade as the musical film Love in the Rough in 1930, starring Robert Montgomery and Dorothy Jordan. Plot Haines plays a shipping clerk named Jack Kelly. He neglected golf to work for the aging Mr. Waters (George Fawcett). On one day, Mr. Waters fires Pop Kelly (Bert Woodruff). Jack witnesses this and is outraged. He wants revenge and breaks a window with a golf ball. Mr. Waters catches him but, instead of being mad, he is impressed with Jack's golfing skills. He later that day announces to his dad he is invited by The Oakmont Country Club to be a guest of the club for a minimum of two weeks. His role there will be the teacher of Mr. Waters, trying to teach him how to golf. Pop doesn't want to say goodbye, but lets him go. At the club, he meets Allie Monte (Joan Crawford) and immediately falls in love with her. He introduces himself as a member from the shipping business of her family. However, Allie sees through him and walks away. Harold Johnson (Edward Earle) is the club champion and devotes himself to Allie. He tries to get her attention at a game, but she is not charmed with his presence. Over the days, the members ‚Äì including Allie ‚Äì become more pleased with Jack as he teaches everyone how to golf. Jack and Allie bond with each other. Johnson feels intimidated by Jack, fearing he could take over the championship title and his girl. Jack kisses Allie, but she storms off. He tries to apologize, but she refuses to talk to him. Therefore he climbs into her room, staying there until she forgives him. The next day, Jack sets a record with the golf tournament. While giving his victory speech, he notices his father, who came there to tell his son how proud he is of him. Jack realizes his club membership is almost over and swears he will marry a rich girl, which would make him allowed to stay at the club. He decides to propose to Allie, but she informs him her father has just lost all of his money. She admits she now has to marry a wealthy man to keep her social position. They are interrupted by Martha Lomsdom (Eileen Percy), who invites them to a party. On their way, Jack sees Allie is flirting with Johnson, so he does the same with the wealthy Martha. At the party, Johnson announces he and Allie are engaged. Jack is devastated, but Martha sees an opportunity in luring him. Her beau confronts her, but she responds she is willing to leave him for Jack. Jack now admits he is not the person to marry for money. When he meets up with Allie to say goodbye, he realizes he can't live without her and tells her he loves her. Allie admits she loves him too, but reminds him she is already engaged to Johnson. They decide to run off and marry. Allie tells her dad Jack is a millionaire shipping man. Jack is afraid to tell her the truth about his income. But when he does, she throws him out. Her family tells her it's a good riddance and she should get an annulment. Allie however refuses, stating he is her husband. In the final scene, Jack becomes rich with winning a golf tournament and is reunited with Allie. Cast *William Haines as Jack Kelly *Joan Crawford as Allie Monte *George K.

Variety said \\"Haines is a likable personality and should travel far. This picture, however, will not help him much. The players do well all around and Ralph Spence's titles contribute effectively on the comedy end, but the director, Sedgwick, could not cope with a weak theme.\\" Author Lawrence J.

History In August 1831, the townspeople of Marblehead requested that a lighthouse be built at the entrance to the harbor. Congress granted the wish and a 23-foot (7m) high tower was built in 1835 and commissioned on October 10, 1835.Marblehead history This tower had an array of ten whale oil burning lamps inside an octagonal lantern. In 1857, the old lamp system was replaced by a sixth order Fresnel lens and reflectors. Despite the upgrade and work on the tower and associated keepers' house, the tower itself was in a poor condition and by 1893 a new light was requested. The new light was completed in 1895 at a cost of $8,786, the cost being much reduced by using a skeletal frame rather than rebuilding the old tower. This new light consisted of eight cast iron piles on concrete foundations. The light was a sixth order Fresnel lens with a kerosene lamp. It was first illuminated on 17 April 1896 as a fixed white light. Later in 1922 it was changed to fixed red and then in 1938 to fixed green.

It is recommended to be given with artesunate to reduce the risk of resistance. Due to the risk of rare but serious side effects, it is not generally recommended to prevent malaria. Though, the WHO in 2013 recommended use for seasonal preventive in children at high risk in combination with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. The side effects of amodiaquine are generally minor to moderate and are similar to those of chloroquine. Rarely liver problems or low blood cell levels may occur. When taken in excess headaches, trouble seeing, seizures, and cardiac arrest may occur. While not extensively studied as of 2007, it appeared to be safe in pregnancy. Amodiaquine is a 4-aminoquinoline compound related to chloroquine. Amodiaquine was first made in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. While not available in the United States, it is widely available in Africa.  Medical uses  Amodiaquine has become an important drug in the combination therapy for malaria treatment in Africa. It is often used in combination with artensunate as a by mouth artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Amodiaquine has also been found to work against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains of malaria. It is also used in combination with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.  Interactions  There have been reports of increased liver toxicity in people with HIV/AIDS on zidovudine or efavirenz when treated with amodiaquine-containing ACT regimens, therefore it is recommended that these people avoid amodiaquine.  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics  It is bioactivated hepatically to its primary metabolite, N-desethylamodiaquine, by the cytochrome p450 enzyme CYP2C8. Among amodiaquine users, several rare but serious side effects have been reported and linked to variants in the CYP2C8 alleles. CYP2C8*1 is characterized as the wild-type allele, which shows an acceptable safety profile, while CYP2C8*2, *3 and *4 all show a range of \\"poor metabolizer\\" phenotypes. People who are poor metabolizers of amodiaquine display lower treatment efficacy against malaria, as well as increased toxicity. Several studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of CYP2C8 alleles amongst malaria patients in East Africa, and have tentatively shown the variant alleles have significant prevalence in that population. About 3.6% of the population studied showed high risk for a poor reaction to or reduced treatment outcomes when treated with amodiaquine. This information is useful in developing programs of pharmacovigilance in East Africa, and have important clinical considerations for prescribing antimalarial medications in regions with high CYP2C8 variant frequency.

However, by the 1940s the record-keeping requirements of outside entities such as the missions, traders and the government brought about change. In response to the government's needs, it decided on the disc number system. Disc The discs were roughly an inch across, burgundy, and made of pressed fibre or leather.

These crimes include failure to appear, false statements, obstruction of justice, contempt of court and perjury. Process crimes are sometimes a basis for a \\"pretextual prosecution\\", in which prosecutors bring process crime charges against a defendant in order to punish them for another crime for which a conviction is more difficult to obtain. Definition Process crimes are the offenses that \\"interfere with the procedures and administration of justice\\". They are prosecuted because they are considered to harm the public interest in the functioning and integrity of the judicial system. There is a broad range of process crimes, covered in the U.S. by a variety of federal and state laws. The five \\"archetypal\\" process charges are failure to appear, false statements, obstruction of justice, contempt of court and perjury. Persons who do not cooperate with an arrest may be charged with such process crimes as resisting arrest, flight to elude arrest or battery on police officers. In U.S. legal literature, prosecutions for process crimes are covered largely as a phenomenon of federal criminal law. But they are also frequently prosecuted in state courts. Pretextual prosecutions Process crimes lend themselves to being prosecuted regardless of the actual harm done to the furtherance of justice. They are therefore frequently a basis for \\"pretextual prosecutions\\", a prosecutorial tactic in which \\"prosecutors target defendants based on suspicion of one crime but prosecute them for another\\". The classic example is the pretextual prosecution of the gangster Al Capone for tax evasion rather than for his many other crimes in 1931. To prosecutors, process crimes are particularly suitable for such purposes because they \\"carry a strong veneer of legitimacy\\" (i.e., most people agree that lying in court should be punishable), because they carry significant penalties, and because the prosecution is able to help produce these crimes. For instance, prosecutors can set up situations such as grand jury hearings or discovery requests in which process crimes ‚Äì lies and omissions ‚Äì tend to frequently occur. Process crimes also tend to be easier to prove than other crimes, and they often do not present a statute of limitations problem because they can arise late in the investigation of another crime that is more difficult to prove. Examples in which process crimes are used for pretextual prosecutions include using \\"dissuading a witness\\" charges to sanction domestic abusers, or contempt charges for violating court orders to stay away from a place or person to punish suspected street criminals. On occasion, prosecutors may even go beyond a pretextual prosecution (through which they seek to sanction a real, if perhaps unprovable, offense) and use process crime charges merely to punish a defendant for their perceived obstinacy or insubordination. =Footnotes= References  Category:Criminal procedure ","title":"Process crime"},{"id":"9913811","text":"Namyit Island (; ; ) is the third-largest island on Tizard Bank in the northwest of the Spratly Islands in South China Sea.

NHM's anchor plus establishment date and the Twentsche Bank's prancing horse. Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) was a Dutch bank that became one of the main predecessors in ABN AMRO. It was created in 1964 when the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij merged with De Twentsche Bank. In 1991 ABN Bank merged with AMRO Bank (Amsterdamsche Rotterdamsche Bank) to form ABN AMRO Bank. History =Merger motives= Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Society) and Twentsche Bank (TB) merged to form ABN Bank on 4 June 1964. An important reason for the merger was the international trend towards concentration. Banks were obliged to scale up their operations. The extensive international network of NTS and the strong Dutch home base of TB, notably in stockbroking and foreign exchange dealing, complemented each other perfectly. Another reason for joining forces was the past involvement of the two banks in developing the textile industry in the Twente region of the Netherlands. NTS had been sharing the running expenses of TB's branch in London (which opened in 1858) since 1953. =Domestic expansion, 1967‚Äì91= The December 1967 acquisition of the Hollandsche Bank-Unie (HBU) with its strong position in South America gave the international network a more balanced structure. The Dutch branch network of ABN Bank was expanded substantially from 1964 onwards in step with the growing significance of retail banking. The acquisition of Bank Mees & Hope in 1975 reflected ABN Bank's diversification strategy since the chief strength of BMH was international commodity finance. After the take over BMH continued to operate independently under its own name. Kingma‚Äôs Bank of Leeuwarden, which BMH had acquired in 1971, was transferred to ABN Bank in early 1981 and continued its operations under the name of ABN/Kingma's Bank. ABN Bank was also active in hire-purchase finance. In 1967 it acquired Industrieele Disconto Maatschappij, in which it already held a minority interest through TB. The independent stockbroking subsidiary Nachenius, Tjeenk & Co, a 1991 amalgamation of two earlier (1977) acquisitions, Weduwe Tjeenk & Co (est. 1810) and Nachenius & Dudok van Heel (est. 1797), gave ABN Bank a foothold in the private banking market. =Global expansion, 1972‚Äì91= The bank also continued its international expansion and in September 1977 the three former Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij branches in Saudi Arabia were incorporated in a new bank, Albank Alsaudi Alhollandi in Riyadh. This bank steadily increased its number of branches and changed its name to Saudi Hollandi Bank in 1991. An important acquisition occurred in 1979 with the takeover of Chicago-based LaSalle National Bank. This acquisition laid the foundation for what would become the second home market of the bank. Founded in 1927 as National Builders Bank of Chicago, LaSalle Bank gave ABN its first firm foothold in the US Midwest. In 1990 Exchange Bancorp of Chicago was incorporated in LaSalle. ABN also stepped up its activities in Europe. In April 1980 it obtained a majority interest in Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet (NSM) of Paris. With roots dating back to 1667, NSM was one of the oldest and prestigious private banks in France. ABN Bank's Parisian subsidiary Banque Jordaan & Cie (in which TB had held an interest since 1909) became part of NSM. NSM acquired Banque Demachy in 1999 to become NSMD. Although ABN Bank had a strong international network of its own, it chose to cooperate with other European banks. The Associated Banks of Europe Corporation (ABECOR) was founded in Brussels in 1972 by ABN Bank and three other banks keen to initiate innovations in banking. ABECOR established Banque de la Soci√©t√© Financi√®re Europ√©enne in Paris which works in the field of medium-term loans. ABN Bank was also involved in setting up Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), in Brussels. Computer links between affiliated banks have greatly accelerated international transactions. =European challenge, 1990‚Äì91= With the coming prospect of the internal European market from 1992, ABN Bank and AMRO Bank decided to approach the challenging new era with combined forces. The merger was completed rapidly after ABN AMRO Holding N.V. made a successful bid for the shares of both banks in August 1990. On September 22, 1991, the new ABN AMRO Bank was established, with head office in Amsterdam.

Biography Stokes was one of three men of the same name; his father was multimillionaire banker Anson Phelps Stokes, and his son was Anson Phelps Stokes, Jr., an Episcopal bishop. He was born in New Brighton on Staten Island, New York, to Anson and Helen Louisa Phelps Stokes, and attended Yale University, graduating in 1896 with a bachelor's degree. At Yale he was inducted into Skull and Bones. He then traveled, mostly in East Asia. In 1897, he entered the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to prepare for the priesthood, and received his bachelor of divinity degree in 1900, although it was not until 1925 that he formally became a priest. In 1899, Stokes took the post of Secretary of Yale University, second in command to the university's president, and he also served as assistant rector of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in New Haven, Connecticut, from 1900 to 1918. Stokes was a favorite to replace Arthur T. Hadley as president of Yale in 1921, and was said to have had the support of a majority of the Yale Corporation, but a vociferous minority insisted that an outsider was needed at the helm of the university, and Stokes was passed over for James Rowland Angell. In December 1903, Stokes married Caroline Mitchell. They had three children: Anson Phelps Stokes, Jr. (1905‚Äì1986), Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes II, both born in New Haven, Connecticut, and Olivia Phelps Stokes. Anson Phelps Stokes, Jr. was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1933. From 1924 to 1939, Stokes was resident canon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. During this time, he became involved in many social, cultural, and ecclesiastical causes, and guided the philanthropy of the Phelps Stokes Fund (established in 1911) to improve the lives of African and American blacks. In 1936, he published a short biography of Booker T. Washington, which was an expanded version of a sketch he had written for the Dictionary of American Biography. Stokes saw all of his work as \\"fellowship in the gospel\\" (Philemon 1:5). He died after a lengthy illness in his Lenox, Massachusetts, home.

After being falsely accused of raping a young white girl, Cheek was released from jail when the grand jury did not indict him, due to lack of evidence. The county magistrate and two other men from Maury County abducted Cheek from Nashville, where he was staying with relatives near Fisk University, took him back to the county, and turned him over to a lynch mob. The mob mutilated the youth and murdered him by hanging. Lynching Cordie Cheek lived with his parents in Glendale, a small community just south of the county seat of Columbia in Maury County. Cordie's mother Tenny \\"worked for many years as a cook, maid, midwife, and nurse\\" for the Moores, a white family who lived nearby. Tenny arranged for her son to help doing chores around the Moore household. Henry Carl Moore, nineteen years old in the winter of 1933, was two years older than Cordie. Friction began to develop between the two young men and, on one occasion, they had come to blows after a dispute over payment due to Cordie and his mother. On November 16, 1933, Cheek was chopping wood for the Moores. As he brought a load into the house, he accidentally collided with Henry's twelve-year-old sister, tearing her dress. Incensed, Henry paid his younger sister one dollar to claim that Cordie had tried to rape her. Following the allegations, Cheek was arrested and placed in jail first in nearby Pulaski and eventually in Nashville, where he was taken out of concern for his safety. A Maury County grand jury eventually declined to indict him on the charge of rape, or for any other lesser crime, due to lack of evidence, and he was released. Once freed, Cheek went to stay in the home of his uncle and aunt, who lived at the edge of the campus of Fisk University in Nashville. A mob formed in Maury County, traveled to Nashville, and abducted Cheek, taking him back to Maury County. Among them were C. Hayes Denton, county magistrate, whose car transported Cheek; Earl Allen, and Bob Hancock. After they returned to Maury County, a white lynch mob formed. The white community was told of the impending lynching and assembled to watch. Cheek was forced to climb a ladder; white men put a blindfold over his face and a rope around his neck, strung from a cedar tree. The men exposed his genitals and castrated him. One man, allegedly Allen, used a pole to push the ladder away from Cordie's feet, causing him to be hanged to death. The onlookers, including women and children, cheered and passed around pistols, firing them into the air in celebration. Aftermath The lynching of Cordie Cheek reverberated across the South. Students and administrators at Fisk University were angered and alarmed, not only for the event but because he had been abducted nearby. Noted historian John Hope Franklin, then a student at Fisk, recalled: > Those of us who had remained in Nashville over the Christmas holidays were > obsessed with discussing the Cordie Cheek lynching. Indeed, the entire > remainder of our junior year was shadowed by this tragic event. There were > investigations, interviews, and other actions. The conclusion that many of > us reached was that if it could happen to Cordie Cheek, who had been seized > within three blocks of the Fisk Chapel, it could happen to any of us. In his 1934 essay, \\"Cowards from the Colleges,\\" Langston Hughes commented that Cheek \\"was abducted almost at the gates of the University.\\" In spite of various protests and calls in Nashville for justice, Gail Williams O'Brien writes that, \\"Maury County officials, along with a number of leading citizens in the community, closed ranks to block indictments against the alleged lynchers, and neither state nor federal forces overcame their resistance.\\"O'Brien (1999), 84 In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America, Gilbert King theorized that the outrage from the lynching of Cheek was one of the factors that catalyzed the resistance of blacks in the Columbia, Tennessee race riot of 1946, noted nationally as the \\"first major racial confrontation\\" of the postwar era. Representation in other media The lynching of Cordie Cheek is the subject of Sandra Seaton's play The Bridge Party, which is anthologized in Strange Fruit: Plays on Lynching by American Women.Seaton, Sandra.

Zeglis (born May 2, 1947) is an American business executive. He served as president of AT&T; from 1997-2001 and as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of AT&T; Wireless from 1999-2004. Zeglis also co-founded the NBA G League's Fort Wayne Mad Ants and served as president and primary shareholder of the organization from 2007 until the acquisition of the team by Pacers Sports and Entertainment in 2015. Early life and education Zeglis was born and brought up in the farming community of Momence, Illinois. His father, Donald, worked as a lawyer. Zeglis played basketball and golf in high school and graduated in 1965. He attended summer camp at the Culver Academies as a teenager. Zeglis attended the University of Illinois College of Business for his undergraduate studies. Both of Zeglis's parents attended the University of Illinois, and he thought it was a perfect fit. While there, he served as the house president of Beta Theta Pi and was a member of Sigma Iota Epsilon. He was also admitted to Beta Gamma Sigma and Phi Kappa Phi. He graduated in 1969 as the valedictorian of the College of Commerce and Business Administration, now known as the Gies College of Business, with a bachelor of science degree in finance. Zeglis went on to attend Harvard Law School, where he served as the senior editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude with a juris doctorate, in 1972. Right after law school, he studied law and economics in Europe on a Knox Memorial fellowship.  Legal and managerial career Zeglis began his career in 1973 in Chicago, Illinois as an associate at the law firm now known as Sidley Austin. He became an official partner five years later in 1978. While there, he worked on the defense of the AT&T; account during the antitrust lawsuit United States v. AT&T;, and when the case resulted in the breakup of the AT&T;/Bell System, he helped restructure the system. With Zeglis' help, AT&T; had successfully broken up into the \\"Baby Bells\\" by 1984. After the breakup, he left Sidney Austin and joined AT&T; as a vice-president and general counsel. In early 1997 C. Michael Armstrong was named CEO of AT&T;, and Armstrong appointed Zeglis as President of AT&T; later in that same year. In 1999, Zeglis assumed the positions of chairman and CEO of AT&T; Wireless. He ended his service as president of AT&T; in 2001, but he continued to serve as chairman and CEO of AT&T; Wireless. Zeglis held these positions all the way until AT&T; Wireless was sold to Cingular and dissolved in 2004. After the dissolution, Zeglis announced that he would be retiring from telecommunications to follow other pursuits. The Mad Ants and the D-League In 2007, Zeglis and others founded the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, an NBA Development League Team. They were the first basketball team in the Fort Wayne area since 2001, when the Fort Wayne Fury folded after a ten-year stint in the Continental Basketball Association. The nickname \\"Mad Ants\\" is a reference to 18th century military officer \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne, who oversaw the construction of the original Fort Wayne. The Mad Ants play at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Zeglis was a primary shareholder as well as the president of the Mad Ants. The height of the team's success was in 2014 when they went undefeated in the playoffs and won the 2014 NBA D-League championship. In September 2015, the Pacers Sports and Entertainment group bought the Mad Ants and converted them into the Indiana Pacers' minor league team. This transaction was one of the hallmark steps in the development of the D-League into a one-to-one affiliate league with the NBA. The D-League is now known as the G League due to the multimillion dollar sponsorship deal between the NBA and Gatorade in 2015, two years after Zeglis sold the Mad Ants. Board service Zeglis has served on a number of corporate, educational and philanthropic boards of trustees and directors, shown below: * Sara Lee Corporation - international consumer-goods company * Helmerich and Payne Corporation - international petroleum company * Illinova Corporation - energy company, subsidiary of Dynegy * The Brookings Institution - think tank based in Washington, DC *Kellogg School - School of Management at Northwestern University *State Farm - insurance company with headquarters in Bloomington, IL * Gies College - College of Business at the University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign *George Washington University - four-year institution in Washington, DC Current life Zeglis, 73, is now retired and resides near Culver, IN with his wife Carol on the eastern shore of Lake Maxinkuckee. He frequently takes part in Culver Academy events, an example being an alumni address in 2019 that he participated in along with one of his sons, Mark, and his daughter, Julie. Zeglis reflected on how his experiences at the Academy taught him how to deal with decision-making and uncertainty, which helped him work through things that ‚Äú[he] had never done before‚Äù at AT&T; and Sidley Austin\\".

Observe that the resolution does not stop after the first blowing-up, when the strict transform is smooth, but when it is simple normal crossings with the exceptional divisors. In algebraic geometry, the problem of resolution of singularities asks whether every algebraic variety V has a resolution, a non- singular variety W with a proper birational map W->V. For varieties over fields of characteristic 0 this was proved in , while for varieties over fields of characteristic p it is an open problem in dimensions at least 4.http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/Publications/Problem_PosChar.pdf Definitions Originally the problem of resolution of singularities was to find a nonsingular model for the function field of a variety X, in other words a complete non-singular variety X‚Ä≤ with the same function field. In practice it is more convenient to ask for a different condition as follows: a variety X has a resolution of singularities if we can find a non-singular variety X‚Ä≤ and a proper birational map from X‚Ä≤ to X. The condition that the map is proper is needed to exclude trivial solutions, such as taking X‚Ä≤ to be the subvariety of non-singular points of X. More generally, it is often useful to resolve the singularities of a variety X embedded into a larger variety W. Suppose we have a closed embedding of X into a regular variety W. A strong desingularization of X is given by a proper birational morphism from a regular variety W‚Ä≤ to W subject to some of the following conditions (the exact choice of conditions depends on the author): # The strict transform X‚Ä≤ of X is regular, and transverse to the exceptional locus of the resolution morphism (so in particular it resolves the singularities of X). #The map from the strict transform of X to X is an isomorphism away from the singular points of X. # W‚Ä≤ is constructed by repeatedly blowing up regular closed subvarieties of W or more strongly regular subvarieties of X, transverse to the exceptional locus of the previous blowings up. # The construction of W‚Ä≤ is functorial for smooth morphisms to W and embeddings of W into a larger variety. (It cannot be made functorial for all (not necessarily smooth) morphisms in any reasonable way.) # The morphism from X‚Ä≤ to X does not depend on the embedding of X in W. Or in general, the sequence of blowings up is functorial with respect to smooth morphisms. Hironaka showed that there is a strong desingularization satisfying the first three conditions above whenever X is defined over a field of characteristic 0, and his construction was improved by several authors (see below) so that it satisfies all conditions above. Resolution of singularities of curves Every algebraic curve has a unique nonsingular projective model, which means that all resolution methods are essentially the same because they all construct this model. In higher dimensions this is no longer true: varieties can have many different nonsingular projective models. lists about 20 ways of proving resolution of singularities of curves. =Newton's method= Resolution of singularities of curves was essentially first proved by , who showed the existence of Puiseux series for a curve from which resolution follows easily. =Riemann's method= Riemann constructed a smooth Riemann surface from the function field of a complex algebraic curve, which gives a resolution of its singularities. This can be done over more general fields by using the set of discrete valuation rings of the field as a substitute for the Riemann surface. =Albanese's method= Albanese's method consists of taking a curve that spans a projective space of sufficiently large dimension (more than twice the degree of the curve) and repeatedly projecting down from singular points to projective spaces of smaller dimension. This method extends to higher-dimensional varieties, and shows that any n-dimensional variety has a projective model with singularities of multiplicity at most n!. For a curve, n = 1, and thus there are no singular points. =Normalization= gave a one step method of resolving singularities of a curve by taking the normalization of the curve. Normalization removes all singularities in codimension 1, so it works for curves but not in higher dimensions. =Valuation rings= Another one-step method of resolving singularities of a curve is to take a space of valuation rings of the function field of the curve. This space can be made into a nonsingular projective curve birational to the original curve. =Blowing up= Repeatedly blowing up the singular points of a curve will eventually resolve the singularities. The main task with this method is to find a way to measure the complexity of a singularity and to show that blowing up improves this measure. There are many ways to do this. For example, one can use the arithmetic genus of the curve. =Noether's method= Noether's method takes a plane curve and repeatedly applies quadratic transformations (determined by a singular point and two points in general position). Eventually this produces a plane curve whose only singularities are ordinary multiple points (all tangent lines have multiplicity 1). =Bertini's method= Bertini's method is similar to Noether's method. It starts with a plane curve, and repeatedly applies birational transformations to the plane to improve the curve. The birational transformations are more complicated than the quadratic transformations used in Noether's method, but produce the better result that the only singularities are ordinary double points. Resolution of singularities of surfaces Surfaces have many different nonsingular projective models (unlike the case of curves where the nonsingular projective model is unique). However a surface still has a unique minimal resolution, that all others factor through (all others are resolutions of it). In higher dimensions there need not be a minimal resolution. There were several attempts to prove resolution for surfaces over the complex numbers by , , , , and , but points out that none of these early attempts are complete, and all are vague (or even wrong) at some critical point of the argument. The first rigorous proof was given by , and an algebraic proof for all fields of characteristic 0 was given by . gave a proof for surfaces of non-zero characteristic. Resolution of singularities has also been shown for all excellent 2-dimensional schemes (including all arithmetic surfaces) by . =Zariski's method= Zariski's method of resolution of singularities for surfaces is to repeatedly alternate normalizing the surface (which kills codimension 1 singularities) with blowing up points (which makes codimension 2 singularities better, but may introduce new codimension 1 singularities). Although this will resolve the singularities of surfaces by itself, Zariski used a more roundabout method: he first proved a local uniformization theorem showing that every valuation of a surface could be resolved, then used the compactness of the Zariski‚ÄìRiemann surface to show that it is possible to find a finite set of surfaces such that the center of each valuation is simple on at least one of these surfaces, and finally by studying birational maps between surfaces showed that this finite set of surfaces could be replaced by a single non-singular surface. =Jung's method= By applying strong embedded resolution for curves, reduces to a surface with only rather special singularities (abelian quotient singularities) which are then dealt with explicitly. The higher-dimensional version of this method is de Jong's method. =Albanese method= In general the analogue of Albanese's method for curves shows that for any variety one can reduce to singularities of order at most n!, where n is the dimension. For surfaces this reduces to the case of singularities of order 2, which are easy enough to do explicitly. =Abhyankar's method= proved resolution of singularities for surfaces over a field of any characteristic by proving a local uniformization theorem for valuation rings. The hardest case is valuation rings of rank 1 whose valuation group is a nondiscrete subgroup of the rational numbers. The rest of the proof follows Zariski's method. =Hironaka's method= Hironaka's method for arbitrary characteristic varieties gives a resolution method for surfaces, which involves repeatedly blowing up points or smooth curves in the singular set. =Lipman's method= showed that a surface Y (a 2-dimensional reduced Noetherian scheme) has a desingularization if and only if its normalization is finite over Y and analytically normal (the completions of its singular points are normal) and has only finitely many singular points. In particular if Y is excellent then it has a desingularization. His method was to consider normal surfaces Z with a birational proper map to Y and show that there is a minimal one with minimal possible arithmetic genus. He then shows that all singularities of this minimal Z are pseudo rational, and shows that pseudo rational singularities can be resolved by repeatedly blowing up points. Resolution of singularities in higher dimensions The problem of resolution of singularities in higher dimensions is notorious for many incorrect published proofs and announcements of proofs that never appeared. =Zariski's method= For 3-folds the resolution of singularities was proved in characteristic 0 by . He first proved a theorem about local uniformization of valuation rings, valid for varieties of any dimension over any field of characteristic 0. He then showed that the Zariski‚ÄìRiemann space of valuations is quasi-compact (for any variety of any dimension over any field), implying that there is a finite family of models of any projective variety such that any valuation has a smooth center over at least one of these models. The final and hardest part of the proof, which uses the fact that the variety is of dimension 3 but which works for all characteristics, is to show that given 2 models one can find a third that resolves the singularities that each of the two given models resolve. =Abhyankar's method= proved resolution of singularities for 3-folds in characteristic greater than 6. The restriction on the characteristic arises because Abhyankar shows that it is possible to resolve any singularity of a 3-fold of multiplicity less than the characteristic, and then uses Albanese's method to show that singularities can be reduced to those of multiplicity at most (dimension)! = 3! = 6. gave a simplified version of Abhyankar's proof. proved resolution of singularities of 3-folds in all characteristics, by proving local uniformization in dimension at most 3, and then checking that Zariski's proof that this implies resolution for 3-folds still works in the positive characteristic case. =Hironaka's method= Resolution of singularities in characteristic 0 in all dimensions was first proved by . He proved that it was possible to resolve singularities of varieties over fields of characteristic 0 by repeatedly blowing up along non-singular subvarieties, using a very complicated argument by induction on the dimension. Simplified versions of his formidable proof were given by several people, including , , , , , . Some of the recent proofs are about a tenth of the length of Hironaka's original proof, and are easy enough to give in an introductory graduate course. For an expository account of the theorem, see and for a historical discussion see . =De Jong's method= found a different approach to resolution of singularities, generalizing Jung's method for surfaces, which was used by and by to prove resolution of singularities in characteristic 0. De Jong's method gave a weaker result for varieties of all dimensions in characteristic p, which was strong enough to act as a substitute for resolution for many purposes. De Jong proved that for any variety X over a field there is a dominant proper morphism which preserves the dimension from a regular variety onto X. This need not be a birational map, so is not a resolution of singularities, as it may be generically finite to one and so involves a finite extension of the function field of X. De Jong's idea was to try to represent X as a fibration over a smaller space Y with fibers that are curves (this may involve modifying X), then eliminate the singularities of Y by induction on the dimension, then eliminate the singularities in the fibers. Resolution for schemes and status of the problem It is easy to extend the definition of resolution to all schemes. Not all schemes have resolutions of their singularities: showed that if a locally Noetherian scheme X has the property that one can resolve the singularities of any finite integral scheme over X, then X must be quasi-excellent. Grothendieck also suggested that the converse might hold: in other words, if a locally Noetherian scheme X is reduced and quasi excellent, then it is possible to resolve its singularities. When X is defined over a field of characteristic 0 and is Noetherian, this follows from Hironaka's theorem, and when X has dimension at most 2 it was prove by Lipman. gave a survey of work on the unsolved characteristic p resolution problem. Method of proof in characteristic zero There are many constructions of strong desingularization but all of them give essentially the same result. In every case the global object (the variety to be desingularized) is replaced by local data (the ideal sheaf of the variety and those of the exceptional divisors and some orders that represents how much should be resolved the ideal in that step). With this local data the centers of blowing-up are defined. The centers will be defined locally and therefore it is a problem to guarantee that they will match up into a global center. This can be done by defining what blowings-up are allowed to resolve each ideal. Done appropriately, this will make the centers match automatically. Another way is to define a local invariant depending on the variety and the history of the resolution (the previous local centers) so that the centers consist of the maximum locus of the invariant. The definition of this is made such that making this choice is meaningful, giving smooth centers transversal to the exceptional divisors. In either case the problem is reduced to resolve singularities of the tuple formed by the ideal sheaf and the extra data (the exceptional divisors and the order, d, to which the resolution should go for that ideal). This tuple is called a marked ideal and the set of points in which the order of the ideal is larger than d is called its co-support. The proof that there is a resolution for the marked ideals is done by induction on dimension. The induction breaks in two steps: # Functorial desingularization of marked ideal of dimension n ‚àí 1 implies functorial desingularization of marked ideals of maximal order of dimension n. # Functorial desingularization of marked ideals of maximal order of dimension n implies functorial desingularization of (a general) marked ideal of dimension n. Here we say that a marked ideal is of maximal order if at some point of its co-support the order of the ideal is equal to d. A key ingredient in the strong resolution is the use of the Hilbert‚ÄìSamuel function of the local rings of the points in the variety. This is one of the components of the resolution invariant. Examples =Multiplicity need not decrease under blowup= The most obvious invariant of a singularity is its multiplicity. However this need not decrease under blowup, so it is necessary to use more subtle invariants to measure the improvement. For example, the rhamphoid cusp y2 = x5 has a singularity of order 2 at the origin. After blowing up at its singular point it becomes the ordinary cusp y2 = x3, which still has multiplicity 2. It is clear that the singularity has improved, since the degree of defining polynomial has decreased. This does not happen in general. An example where it does not is given by the isolated singularity of x2 \\\\+ y3z + z3 = 0 at the origin. Blowing it up gives the singularity x2 \\\\+ y2z + yz3 = 0. It is not immediately obvious that this new singularity is better, as both singularities have multiplicity 2 and are given by the sum of monomials of degrees 2, 3, and 4. =Blowing up the most singular points does not work= Whitney umbrella A natural idea for improving singularities is to blow up the locus of the \\"worst\\" singular points. The Whitney umbrella x2 = y2z has singular set the z axis, most of whose point are ordinary double points, but there is a more complicated pinch point singularity at the origin, so blowing up the worst singular points suggests that one should start by blowing up the origin. However blowing up the origin reproduces the same singularity on one of the coordinate charts. So blowing up the (apparently) \\"worst\\" singular points does not improve the singularity. Instead the singularity can be resolved by blowing up along the z-axis. There are algorithms that work by blowing up the \\"worst\\" singular points in some sense, such as , but this example shows that the definition of the \\"worst\\" points needs to be quite subtle. For more complicated singularities, such as x2 = ymzn which is singular along x = yz =0, blowing up the worst singularity at the origin produces the singularities x2 = ym+n‚àí2zn and x2 = ymzm+n‚àí2 which are worse than the original singularity if m and n are both at least 3. After resolution, the total transform (the union of the strict transform and the exceptional divisors) is a variety with singularities of the simple normal crossings type. It is natural to consider the possibility of resolving singularities without resolving this type of singularities, this is finding a resolution that is an isomorphism over the set of smooth and simple normal crossing points. When the strict transform is a divisor (i.e., can be embedded as a codimension one subvariety in a smooth variety) it is known that there exists a strong resolution avoiding simple normal crossing points. Whitney's umbrella shows that it is not possible to resolve singularities avoiding blowing-up the normal crossings singularities. =Incremental resolution procedures need memory= A natural way to resolve singularities is to repeatedly blow up some canonically chosen smooth subvariety. This runs into the following problem. The singular set of x2 = y2z2 is the pair of lines given by the y and z axes. The only reasonable varieties to blow up are the origin, one of these two axes, or the whole singular set (both axes). However the whole singular set cannot be used since it is not smooth, and choosing one of the two axes breaks the symmetry between them so is not canonical. This means we have to start by blowing up the origin, but this reproduces the original singularity, so we seem to be going round in circles. The solution to this problem is that although blowing up the origin does not change the type of the singularity, it does give a subtle improvement: it breaks the symmetry between the two singular axes because one of them is an exceptional divisor for a previous blowup, so it is now permissible to blow up just one of these. However, in order to exploit this the resolution procedure needs to treat these 2 singularities differently, even though they are locally the same. This is sometimes done by giving the resolution procedure some memory, so the center of the blowup at each step depends not only on the singularity, but on the previous blowups used to produce it. =Resolutions are not functorial= Conical singularity x2 \\\\+ y2 = z2 Some resolution methods (in characteristic 0) are functorial for all smooth morphisms. However it is not possible to find a strong resolution functorial for all (possibly non-smooth) morphisms. An example is given by the map from the affine plane A2 to the conical singularity x2 \\\\+ y2 = z2 taking (X,Y) to (2XY, X2 ‚àí Y2, X2 \\\\+ Y2). The XY-plane is already nonsingular so should not be changed by resolution, and any resolution of the conical singularity factorizes through the minimal resolution given by blowing up the singular point. However the rational map from the XY-plane to this blowup does not extend to a regular map. =Minimal resolutions need not exist= Minimal resolutions (resolutions such that every resolution factors through them) exist in dimensions 1 and 2, but not always in higher dimensions. The Atiyah flop gives an example in 3 dimensions of a singularity with no minimal resolution. Let Y be the zeros of xy = zw in A4, and let V be the blowup of Y at the origin. The exceptional locus of this blowup is isomorphic to P1√óP1, and can be blown down to P1 in 2 different ways, giving two small resolutions X1 and X2 of Y, neither of which can be blown down any further. =Resolutions should not commute with products= gives the following example showing that one cannot expect a sufficiently good resolution procedure to commute with products. If f:A->B is the blowup of the origin of a quadric cone B in affine 3-space, then f√óf:A√óA->B√óB cannot be produced by an √©tale local resolution procedure, essentially because the exceptional locus has 2 components that intersect. =Singularities of toric varieties= Singularities of toric varieties give examples of high-dimensional singularities that are easy to resolve explicitly. A toric variety is defined by a fan, a collection of cones in a lattice. The singularities can be resolved by subdividing each cone into a union of cones each of which is generated by a basis for the lattice, and taking the corresponding toric variety. =Choosing centers that are regular subvarieties of X= Construction of a desingularization of a variety X may not produce centers of blowings up that are smooth subvarieties of X. Many constructions of a desingularization of an abstract variety X proceed by locally embedding X in a smooth variety W, considering its ideal in W and computing a canonical desingularization of this ideal. The desingularization of ideals uses the order of the ideal as a measure of how singular is the ideal. The desingularization of the ideal can be made such that one can justify that the local centers patch together to give global centers. This method leads to a proof that is relatively simpler to present, compared to Hironaka's original proof, which uses the Hilbert-Samuel function as the measure of how bad singularities are. For example, the proofs in , , , and use this idea. However, this method only ensures centers of blowings up that are regular in W. The following example shows that this method can produce centers that have non-smooth intersections with the (strict transform of) X. Therefore, the resulting desingularization, when restricted to the abstract variety X, is not obtained by blowing up regular subvarieties of X. Let X be the subvariety of the four-dimensional affine plane, with coordinates x,y,z,w, generated by y2-x3 and x4+xz2-w3. The canonical desingularization of the ideal with these generators would blow up the center C0 given by x=y=z=w=0. The transform of the ideal in the x-chart if generated by x-y2 and y2(y2+z2-w3). The next center of blowing up C1 is given by x=y=0. However, the strict transform of X is X1, which is generated by x-y2 and y2+z2-w3. This means that the intersection of C1 and X1 is given by x=y=0 and z2-w3=0, which is not regular. To produce centers of blowings up that are regular subvarieties of X stronger proofs () use the Hilbert-Samuel function of the local rings of X rather than the order of its ideal in the local embedding in W. Other variants of resolutions of singularities After the resolution the total transform, the union of the strict transform, X, and the exceptional divisor, is a variety that can be made, at best, to have simple normal crossing singularities. Then it is natural to consider the possibility of resolving singularities without resolving this type of singularities. The problem is to find a resolution that is an isomorphism over the set of smooth and simple normal crossing points. When X is a divisor, i.e. it can be embedded as a codimension-one subvariety in a smooth variety it is known to be true the existence of the strong resolution avoiding simple normal crossing points. The general case or generalizations to avoid different types of singularities are still not known. . Avoiding certain singularities is impossible. For example, one can't resolve singularities avoiding blowing-up the normal crossings singularities. In fact, to resolve the pinch point singularity the whole singular locus needs to be blown up, including points where normal crossing singularities are present.

Early years Both Hill & Burgess attended Bishop Luffa secondary school in Chichester and when they met in the late 1980s it was clear they shared a similar sense of humour. It was in 1990 that Nuclear Freakout was formed along with fellow school friend Robert Thurston. Thurston left the following year and it was Hill & Burgess along with other school friends that continued under the Freakout banner. Much of Freakout's music was based on recorded improvisations between Hill & Burgess but also included recordings of various line-ups of school friends. They released a tape of demos in 1991 & two albums. 'Rub me up the wrong way' in 1995 which drew from material recorded between 1990‚Äì94 and the follow-up 'Rub me up the right way' in 1996. Plans for a third album never materialised.  Earthlings Calling Earthlings  As their teenage years drew to a close, Hill & Burgess decided to develop their ideas into a more refined music. They spent 1997 recording which resulted in the 'Earthlings Calling Earthlings' album and the subsequent drop of the Nuclear Freakout name. The album was released in March 1998 and even achieved a small amount of air play on BBC national radio. The album showcased the unique writing style which incorporated lyrics about bizarre characters which Hill & Burgess would act out in the songs. The music was catchy and melodic, although quite odd and unique.  Sessions  The Earthlings music is dominantly improvised. Hill & Burgess compose the vast majority of their music in what they refer to as their 'sessions'. This involves setting up in a recording environment and improvising ideas. Burgess provides the Guitar backing and usually the chorus while Hill dominates the lyrics and verses. The results are recorded and sometimes ideas are developed further at a later time. To date, Hill & Burgess have a huge archive of the session recordings dating from the early 1990s to 2009.  Keeping My Eye On You  Work began on the follow-up to 'Earthlings Calling Earthling' in late 2002. Whereas the previous album was dominantly acoustic, this time they opted for the standard drums, bass, guitar sound using drummer James Aslett. Burgess also brought in the Brighton based fiddler Tim Cotterell for fiddle duties on a number of tracks. The album was finally mixed and released in December 2006.  Future plans  The Earthlings announced recently that work had commenced on their third album.

It was directed by David Gordon Green, who also wrote the screenplay adapted from Stewart O'Nan's 1994 novel of the same title. The film premiered in the dramatic competition at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. It is a character driven film centered on several characters dealing with loss of innocence in a small town. Snow Angels was released on 7 March 2008. Plot On a cold afternoon, with snow on the ground, a high school band in a small Pennsylvania town is practicing for the season‚Äôs last football game, when they hear gunshots while their teacher, Mr. Chervenick, is giving instructions. The film abruptly flashes back to a few weeks before, to a Chinese restaurant that employs a high school boy named Arthur, his ex-babysitter, Annie, and her best friend, Barb. Arthur, who's a bit of a misfit, has a troubled home life caused by his constantly clashing parents, both of whom often forget about him. Annie's life isn't faring much better: she's dealing with her ill mother, is separated from her husband, Glenn, and is now raising their young daughter, Tara, on her own. Glenn is now on the wagon and becoming a born-again Christian in order to prove that he is responsible enough to spend time with Tara. Depressed and lonely, Annie decides to betray her best friend by having an affair with Barb's husband, Nate, but finds that ruining Barb's life doesn‚Äôt make her own life any happier. Desperate to prove himself and still harboring deep feelings for his estranged wife (though he suspects is seeing someone), Glenn gets a new job and spends as much time as possible with Tara. Meanwhile, Arthur finds himself growing close to Lila, a new student at the high school who has a knack for photography. The film focuses heavily on how people's lives can cross in a small town, especially when Tara wanders out of the house and goes missing while Annie, drained over having meaninglessly destroyed her friendship with Barb and suffering from a bad cold, falls asleep on the couch. The whole town spends hours desperately searching for Tara, before Arthur finds her body while smoking pot with his friend. To everyone‚Äôs horror, Tara had fallen into open freezing water at the edge of the lake while playing and drowned, after which the open water froze over her. Glenn distraught over the death of his little girl, Tara, breaks into Annie's home with his shotgun and waits for her return. Upon Annie's return Glenn grabs her and forcibly washes her feet. Covering her mouth as she cries and screams at him, he drags a barefoot Annie by the collar into the snowy woods. With her kneeling, back turned to him, Glenn holds his gun to her head and tells her to say when she's ready (to be shot). The movie presumably ends with their murder-suicide, explaining the shots heard before the flashback.

Reception =Critical response= The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 68% approval rating with an average rating of 6.8/10 based on 110 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"With fine acting and considerable emotional depth, Snow Angels aptly captures the highs, and especially the lows of human relationships.\\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 28 reviews. Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer called the film \\"a compelling, and grim, portrait of small-town lives gone wrong\\", \\"disturbingly good\\", while also writing, \\"the film's characters get inside your skin, your soul. It's enough to make you want to cry.\\" Richard Corliss of Time wrote, \\"The film's success is due in large part to actors who are both faithful to all the social minutiae and seductive enough to keep you watching.\\" He also praised director David Gordon Green for his gift, \\"to show how people learn codes of affection and aggression from watching movies, but when they try to pull them off in crucial situations they come out awkward, embarrassed and futile.\\" The film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Marc Mohan of The Oregonian named it the 4th best film of 2008, and Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune named it the 8th best film of 2008. Among the critics who gave the film a negative review was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling the film, \\"funny, beautifully written, nicely observed, sweetly familiar. For the first half\\", and felt, \\"the film's change of key in the second half feels like a betrayal.\\" =Box office= The film opened in limited release in the United States on March 7, 2008 and grossed $14,247 in two theaters its opening weekend.

Old Gorhambury House Grimston was born as William Luckyn, the younger son of Sir William Luckyn, 3rd Baronet, and his wife Mary Sherrington. In 1700 he succeeded to the estates, including Gorhambury near St Albans, of his great- uncle Sir Samuel Grimston, 3rd Baronet, of Bradfield, and assumed the surname of Grimston in lieu of Luckyn. In 1705 he published a play 'The Lawyer's Fortune or Love in a Hollow Tree'. He married Jean Cooke, daughter of James Cooke, on 14 August 1706. Grimston was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for St Albans in the 1710 general election and was elected in a contest in 1713. His fortunes at the constituency were affected by the competitive ambitions of Sarah Duchess of Marlborough who also had an interest. Although he won the seat in 1715 he was defeated in 1722. In 1719 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Dunboyne and Viscount Grimston. As these were Irish peerages they did not prohibit Grimston from sitting in the British House of Commons. He regained the seat at St Albans in 1727 but lost it again in 1734. In 1737 he succeeded his elder brother Sir Harbottle Luckyn as fifth Baronet. His feud with the duchess continued until her death as they each tried to prevent the return of each other's candidates at St Albans in subsequent elections. Although Grimston had tried to suppress all copies of his play, in 1736 the Duchess published a version of it with disparaging notes to mock him. Grimston died in October 1756, aged 72. He and his wife had ten sons and three daughters. He was succeeded in his titles by his son James. Lady Grimston died in 1765. References * *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

Place name \\"Llanfair\\" is a typical Welsh place name - in English it translates as \\"church(yard) of St Mary\\". \\"Waterdine\\", which means \\"place by the water\\" was added to the name to distinguish the village from other places called \\"Llanfair\\" (which is a very common place name in Wales). The place name in the Welsh language is Llanfair Dyffryn Tefeidiad (the 2nd and 3rd words mean \\"Teme Valley\\"). Location Llanfair Waterdine is just off the B4355 road, northwest of Knighton and near the village of Knucklas, which has a railway station. The village lies southwest of the small Shropshire town of Clun. Also nearby is the small village of Lloyney (just on the other side of the Teme, in Wales). The village and parish is situated on the southern edge of the Clun Forest, a remote and very rural part of Shropshire, which is only partly forested. The village was historically in Wales, as it lies to the west of Offa's Dyke. The River Teme has naturally altered its course since the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 (\\"Act of Union\\"); and so the border between Wales and England in the Teme valley no longer follows the centre of the river as it once did, but stays on what was the course of the river when the border was fixed by the Acts.

An accomplished scribe, he made copies of The Book of Arms and was a herald bard. His chronicle of British history, written in the Welsh language, survives in two copies; it follows the style of contemporary historians in England, beginning with the sons of Noah and continuing down to 1556.

The current tower was erected in 1857, replacing two earlier towers that had been built in 1797 and 1831. It is the oldest and tallest lighthouse on Cape Cod. The grounds are open year-round, while the light is open to the public from May until late October, with guided tours available. Highland Light is owned by the National Park Service, and was cared for by the Highland Museum and Lighthouse, Inc. until 2014 when Eastern National, another non-profit group, took over the contract to operate the facility as a tourist attraction.http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=491 The United States Coast Guard operates the light as an aid to navigation.http://www.capecodlight.org/ The United States Navy ship was named after the light. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Highland Light Station. History In 1797, a station authorized by George Washington was established at this point on the Cape, with a wood lighthouse to warn ships about the dangerous coastline between Cape Ann and Nantucket. It was the first light on Cape Cod. In 1833, the wood structure was replaced by a brick tower and in 1840 a new lantern and lighting apparatus was installed. In 1857 the lighthouse was declared dangerous and demolished, and for a total cost of $17,000, the current 66-foot brick tower was constructed. On June 6, 1900, the light was changed from a fixed beam to flashing, with a new. The new Barbier, Benard & Turenne first-order Fresnel lens had four panels of 0.92 meter focal distance, revolved in mercury, and gave, every five seconds, flashes of about 192,000 candlepower nearly one-half second in duration. While the new lens was being installed, the light from a third-order lens was exhibited atop a temporary tower erected near the lighthouse; it was later sold at auction. The Highland Light was then the most powerful on the east coast of the United States. Two four-horsepower oil engines with compressors operated by an engine fueled by kerosene, were added to ensure that the fog signal could be activated within ten minutes instead of the previous 45. A new fog signal was installed in 1929, an electrically operated air oscillator, to make it audible over a greater distance. The lighthouse was converted to electric operation in 1932 with a 1000-watt beacon. In 1946, Highland Light's Fresnel lens was replaced by modern aerobeacons, first by a Crouse-Hinds DCB-36 double rotating light and then by a Carlisle & Finch DCB-224, with a second unit as backup. Unfortunately, the Fresnel lens was severely damaged when it was removed, but fragments are on display in the museum on site. The light was fully automated by 1986 with a Crouse-Hinds DCB-224 rotating beacon.https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/maritime/hig.htm In 1998, a VRB-25 optical system was installed. Most recently, the light source is a Vega Marine LED beacon model 44/2.5 installed in April 2017. The current location of the lighthouse is not the original site. It was in danger of falling down the cliff due to beach erosion, so the structure was moved to the west. The government funding to do so was supplemented by money raised through fund raising by the Truro Historical Society.http://trurohistoricalsociety.org/highland-light-on-the-move-a-brief- history/ The move was accomplished by International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, New York and Expert House Movers of Maryland over a period of 18 days in July, 1996. The move left the light station on Cape Cod National Seashore property, bordering the Highland Golf Course. After an errant golf ball broke a window, they were replaced with unbreakable material. In 1998, the keeper's house was modified to be a gift shop and museum. The lighthouse grounds are open year- round on Highland Light Road in Truro, with tours and the museum available from a National Park Service partner, Eastern National,http://www.highlandlighthouse.org/about-us during the summer months. Highland Light in art Painter Edward Hopper, who owned a summer house in Truro, painted this lighthouse in his work Highland Light, North Truro (1930). Although the light was subsequently moved, the landscape still resembles the vista painted by Hopper. The watercolor resides at the Harvard Art Museums.

The area relating to skiing is found on the Rothorn mountain, above the town of Zermatt. The trails extend to the valley floor between the Rothorn and Gornergrat mountains, and includes the ski runs directly down to the Oberhausern area of the town of Zermatt, terminating at the passenger lift that takes skier directly down inside the funicular train station in the area. The Sunnegga area catches a large amount of sun due to its unique topography, often despite the rest of Zermatt being submerged in cloud. Restaurants There are several restaurants in the Findeln area, including Chez Vrony, Findlerhof, Enzian and Paradise. Lift system The (Unter)-Rothorn with the Kumme chairlift in front and the Blauherd-Rothorn cable car in the back Access from the resort to the Sunnegga area is via the SunneggaExpress funicular railway, built in 1980. From here there is a new \\"Combi\\" lift (a combination of 6-seat chairlifts and 8-seat gondola lifts, built in 2005) that takes skiers up to the Blauherd interchange. From here there is a 150-person cable car (built in 1996) up to the Rothorn, and an old 4-seater gondola (built in 1971) down to Gant on the valley floor, from which a connecting cable car carries passengers up to the Gornergrat ski area. At the Rothorn area there is the Kumme 3-seat chairlift that serves a series of runs to the side of the Rothorn. Skiing down below the Sunnegga area is covered by the Patrullarve 4-seat lift (built in 1989), which transports skiers directly up to Blauherd. Accessing the Gornergrat area is the Sunnegga- Findeln-Breitboden 4-seat chairlift (built in 2007 to replace a 2-seat chairlift built in 1956). Skiing The main novice arterial of the Sunnegga area, the Standard, starts at Blauherd, and continues down to Sunnegga. There is a narrow, often busy, novice run down to Findeln, Easy run, which mainly serves the purpose of serving the area's famous restaurants and terminates at the 4-seat Findeln chairlift. Below this is a beginners area, the Eisfluh. The other main novice run, the Kumme, can be found outside the Rothorn top station, that takes skiers down to the Kumme 3-seat chairlift. Advanced runs are best found by Fluhalp, which links the Rothorn to the Gornergrat via the Gant Hothalli cable car, and the Tuftern which takes the skier from Blauherd down to Patrullarve. Zermatt does not have many listed expert runs, as such tend to be graded as itineraries. The Rothorn area has several expert runs, but have been poorly used in the last few years due to inadequate snowfall and the area's propensity to catch large amounts of sunshine. There are only two expert runs in the area, the longest of which, the Obere National, runs from Blauherd down to Patrullarve. There are off-piste sections off to the left of this run that can prove enjoyable when snow cover is good. The second expert run, the Downhill, is found by taking a left turn at the top of the Rothorn, from which you can find a blue, red and black. This run is actually quite timid - being a simple straight run, and all of these runs suffer badly if snowfall is not plentiful.

This grove is notable because it allows for the use of self-guided tours of the flat, loop trail which is easily accessible (within of a vehicle parking lot). Dozens of large, old Redwood trees are located within a few feet of the walking trail. Fog is of major importance in Coast Redwood ecology. Redwood National Park. Natural history Coast Redwoods, (Sequoia sempervirens), are a native tree in the deep valleys and low to middle elevations (up to 750 m) of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Their growth and longevity is enhanced by the proximity to the ocean with its massive amounts of precipitation, the cool air which encourages fog, and the dimmer sunlight near the moisture-rich trunk-base region. Free- flowing, year-round stream help to enhance this environment and the cool, moisture-laden air often produces visible fog, which helps to replenish the trees. The bark of these giants is heavily laden with tannin, which helps to offer protection from damage by either fires or insects. This grove has some of the tallest and oldest trees in the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, because the environment has been preserved to maintain a natural ecology. Undergrowth is never cleared, there is no logging allowed and deadfalls and lightning-struck trees are allowed to proceed naturally with their processes, unless they impair access to the grove. This rich, biotic environment is filled with natural nutrients which make up for the massive amounts of waterfall which might otherwise deplete the soil. Old growth groves such as this will show the birth (shoots and burls) and death (rotting trees and \\"fairy rings\\") of ancient redwoods, many of whose birth was before the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Of course, all the native flora and fauna which have existed in these mountains for centuries are allowed to remain‚Äîeven to the extent of the highly irritating poison oak plants. Early history This part of the California coastline was once a tribal area for the Awaswas (Santa Cruz) division of Ohlone Indian people. In 1769, Gaspar de Portol√† camped on the banks of the San Lorenzo River and erected a wooden cross to mark the location as part of his exploration for Spain.Yenne, p. 112 This exploration offered the peoples of this richly, resourced area, known as Alta California, to be brought under Catholicism by the Friars Minor. Little more than twenty years later, in 1791, a Catholic mission, Mission Santa Cruz was consecrated nearby. This mission, served as a site for ecclesiastical conversion of natives. From 1805 to 1812, the mission was run by Father Andr√©s Quintana who was one of only two Spanish missionaries martyred in Alta California. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the newly independent Mexico assumed control of this area until the transfer to the United States in 1846. During Mexican ownership, it was common for land grants to be sold to those who were in favor with the government. Large portions of this virgin-forested area were given out as Rancho Carbonera, Rancho Zayante and Rancho Ca√±ada del Rincon en el Rio San Lorenzo. These \\"gifted\\" land grants were the start of European settlement in the area that is now known as Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. In 1843, the Mexican Government granted a parcel of under the name of Rancho Ca√±ada del Rincon en el Rio San Lorenzo de Santa Cruz to a French immigrant named Pedro Sansevain. This grant essentially encompassed what is today known as the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. After a few transfers of land over about twenty years, the granted Rancho Ca√±ada del Rincon ended up in the hands of Henry Cowell. Trail Details A large burn-scar at the base of a redwood tree showing the fire-retardant and healing properties of the bark. # Coastal Zone Environment The Coastal Redwoods grow exceptionally well in this temperate, foggy environment. This is the perfect environment for the trees, since it is moist, dim and far enough from the coast so that there is no salt in the air. # The red color of Redwood Trees? These trees have a much higher level of tannic acid in their bark than other trees, giving them the red color. # Fire Resistance The high level of tannic acid in the wood and bark in combination with the thickness of the bark (6-12\\") help to provide a resistance to natural and man-made fires. The growth layer, protected by the thick bark, allow a healing process to occur after damage. # Other Species Douglas Firs are often found interspersed with Coastal Redwoods as they are adapted to the same environment. # Circular Groups \\"Fairy Rings\\" and \\"Cathedral Groups\\" are typically see in Redwood forests as examples of the incredible rejuvenating ability of these species. The death of a tree often results in the growth of a number of new trees in a ring around the nutrients- rich, decaying center. Burls from the original tree as well as seeds which have fallen at the base of the trunk provide this new life. The missing central tree allows for a \\"hole\\" in the vegetative canopy so that the new plants has sufficient light for growth. # Decaying Trees Since this is a protected area, trees which have fallen to the ground are allowed to decay and provide shelter for insects. This results in further nutrients for the remaining live trees in the area. #280 feet tall The largest tree in the grove has a diameter of over in order to support a height of . # The Fremont Tree. The story is told that in 1846, when Lt. John C. Fremont explored this part of California, he and his party camped overnight in the burned-out base of this tree. The interior is larger than the typical military tent of the 1840s, which would have offered a splendid shelter for several adults. When asked to confirm the story during and interview in 1888, his comment was, \\"It makes a great story, let it stand.\\"Park page 4 # Burls These wart-like bumps which appear on the sides of the trunk and roots of Redwood trees are a part of the growth layer of the tree. Often small shoots will grow from burls and roots which result, over time, in significant reforestation. Image:FremontPlaque.JPGHenry Cowell Redwoods State Park, Redwood Grove.

Image:Burls.JPGSeveral large burls formed on the base of a redwood tree showing the unusual regeneration method used by redwoods. Hazards Rash-causing poison oak abounds in the grove. Poison oak is a native ground-cover in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The plants are most obvious during the part of the year when the leaves change color toward the red spectrum. Most of the years, the plants are only recognized by the shape of their lobed-leaves, making them more hazardous to the unaware. None of the poison oak plants are removed in this grove in a commitment to preserving the natural aspect of the area. Gallery Image:Coast_redwood_bark.jpg Close view of Coast Redwood bark.

A member of a notable family of west country architect-surveyors and masons, he was related Howard Colvin claims he was the nephew of the bastard brothers but Nikolaus Pevsner claims (Dorset page 383) he was their brother to the Bastard brothers who rebuilt Blandford Forum following its great fire of 1731. Bastard was responsible for the Palladian Sherborne House, at Sherborne in Dorset built in the 1720s.Pevsner p 383 attributes the house to Bastard but refers to Sherborne House as \\"Lord Digby's School\\" the name by which the house was known during the mid 20th century The accomplished design of this mansion like the works of the Bastard brothers shows late Baroque influences such as those found in the works of Wren and Hawksmoor. In style and design it could be compared to Winslow Hall attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Chicheley Hall like Winslow Hall also in Buckinghamshire. Sherborne House has a three bayed centre projecting from two symmetrical flanking wings each of two bays. The tall slim windows are typical of the English Baroque period which immediately predated the Palladian period. The Baroque style is further emphasised by the broken segmental pediment and architrave of the main entrance. However, the facade, with its central pediment and the balustrade concealing the roof line are devoid of ornament in the Palladian tradition. The only relief from the severity of the facade coming from the quoining at each corner. In 1743 Bastard was commissioned to design a hospital for the reception of the poor, later known as the Dorchester parish workhouse.Dorchester This building has been much altered but the original block can still be discerned as Palladian, albeit in a very severe and chaste form as would have been thought fitting for such an institution at the time. There is a wall monument with a pediment to Benjamin and Thomas Bastard, dated 1772, on the external face of the north wall of the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, Castleton, Sherborne in Dorset.

Originally known as \\"Craigie\\", the club became East Craigie after a donation from the owner of a local farm of that name.

Their current Craigie Park ground was opened in April 1932 with a game against Celtic which drew almost 8,000 spectators. Former East Craigie players include Jimmy Sharp and Jimmy Easson who both went on to gain full international honours for Scotland, and Archie Taylor who won the FA Cup with both Bolton Wanderers and Barnsley.

History Toronto's original House of Providence, circa 1857 Providence Healthcare's Catholic legacy dates back to 1857 when the Sisters of St. Joseph founded the original House of Providence. The original site of the House of Providence was on Power Street in downtown Toronto, which is now the Don Valley Parkway exit to Adelaide and Richmond Streets. At that location, the House of Providence hit a peak of 700 people they were providing accommodations for, among them were the most vulnerable in society. Providence moved to its current location in 1962. The location is a former farm owned by the Sisters of St. Joseph. Once the facility changed its location it began to focus on residential care for the elderly and sick. Along with this, the name House of Providence changed to Providence Villa and Hospital. The name was changed once again to Providence Centre so it would better reflect its diversity of services, not only to residents and patients but the entire community. The Sisters of St. Joseph sponsored Providence Centre up until 1998 when the Catholic Health Corporation of Ontario assumed sponsorship. The name was changed once again in 2004 to Providence Healthcare. On 1 August 2017, Providence Healthcare merged with St. Joseph's Health Centre and St. Michael's Hospital to form a new hospital network. Services Programs and services are provided through three Integrated Care Divisions: Providence Hospital, one of Ontario's largest rehabilitation and complex continuing care facilities; the Cardinal Ambrozic Houses of Providence, a long-term care facility for 288 residents; and Providence Community Centre, specializing in community clinics, caregiver support, education and neighbourhood outreach programs, such as Adult Day Program and the Tamil Caregiver Project. Included in the facility is an Integrated Healing Arts Centre. This centre offers services including acupuncture, chiropody, chiropractic services, massage therapy and physiotherapy Employment In 2009, for the second year in a row, Providence Healthcare was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.

Family background Sir John Chesshyre was born at Hallwood, Halton, Runcorn, Cheshire, the son of Thomas and Catherine Chesshyre. Thomas Chesshyre was Bailiff of the Lordship of Halton and Whitley. The family had been Royalists in the Civil War and they had sustained severe financial penalties when the Parliamentarians were ruling the country. Legal career John Chesshyre was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1682 and called to the bar there in 1689. In 1705 he accepted the degree of serjeant-at-law. He became one of the crown counsel as queen's sergeant in 1711 and was knighted in 1713. In 1727 he was declared the king's first serjeant. His profession made him a wealthy man; in the six years from 1719 he earned an average of over ¬£3,000 a year, making him one of the highest earning counsels practising in Westminster Hall. In 1725 he reduced his practice, confining it to the Court of Common Pleas, thus reducing his annual income to an average of ¬£1,300. () Personal life Chesshyre Library For most of his professional life he lived in London, either in his house in Isleworth, which was then in Middlesex, or in his other home in Essex Street, off the Strand, or in his chambers in the Inner Temple. His death in 1738 was sudden and the Gentleman's Magazine stated that he \\"was worth ¬£100,000 all acquired by the Law\\". He had expressed a wish to be buried in Runcorn parish church but he wanted \\"no lying in state nor pompous train of coaches into Cheshire nor any unnecessary attendance\\". Nevertheless, his funeral procession took five days to travel from Isleworth to Runcorn and his funeral expenses amounted to over ¬£350. There is a monument to his memory in Runcorn parish church but this is now out of sight behind the organ. Sir John's first wife died in London in 1705 and was buried in Runcorn. In 1706 he married Ann Lawley who outlived him to die in 1756. His brother, Robert Chesshyre, was vicar of Runcorn and he died in 1739. Halton Vicarage Chesshyre Library Sir John is best remembered locally for founding a library at Halton and for leaving an endowment in his will for its further maintenance. The library had been completed in 1733 and was furnished with 400 books which were mainly ecclesiastical histories and works of law. The library had been intended for the incumbent of Halton and \\"for any divine or divines of the Church of England or other gentlemen or persons of letters\\". This made it in effect the first, or one of the first, free libraries in England. Sir John also built the vicarage in Halton in 1739 and endowed the curacy there. As time passed, the endowment proved insufficient for the maintenance of the building and its contents. By the middle of the 19th century it had \\"no function and no money\\". By the middle of the 20th century it was in a state of advanced dilapidation. The adjacent land owned by the church was acquired by the North-West Water Authority. A new parish hall was built with money received as compensation from the Water Authority and a passageway was made to link the hall with the library which now serves as a meeting room. The library is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and its gates are listed at Grade II.

Synopsis After an evening of entertaining guests, an intoxicated Baron Munchausen goes to sleep only to experience a variety of disturbing and otherworldly dreams. Production M√©li√®s greatly admired the Baron Munchausen stories created by Rudolf Erich Raspe, and may have used them as inspiration for his celebrated film A Trip to the Moon. However, Baron Munchausen's Dream has little in common with the Baron character or his traditional adventures. Many of the props are recycled from M√©li√®s's earlier films, such as an elaborate dragon puppet from the 1906 fantasy The Witch. Effects in the film were created using stage machinery, pyrotechnics, substitution splices, and dissolves. The mirror sequence in the film is based on a routine that had long been popular in music halls. The effect was not produced with a real mirror, which would have reflected the studio windows and the camera; instead, there were two actors on the set, one of whom mimicked the other's gestures from the opposite side of the imaginary \\"glass.\\" The comedian Max Linder revived the mirror routine in his 1921 film Seven Years Bad Luck. Release The film's original title is Les Hallucinations du baron de M√ºnchausen; it is also known as Les Aventures de baron de Munchhausen, and is known in English as Baron Munchausen's Dream. The film was one of six commissioned from M√©li√®s by the studio Path√© Fr√®res; M√©li√®s made the film in his Star Film Company studio, relying on Path√© to distribute it. However, it is unknown if Path√© ever actually released the film. The film was released, possibly for the first time, in 1943; the exhibitor was Andr√© Robert, who obtained permission for the screenings from M√©li√®s's widow, Jehanne d'Alcy. Because M√ºnchhausen, a German film about the Baron, was then playing in Paris theaters, Robert changed the title of the M√©li√®s film to Monsieur le Baron a trop bien d√Æn√©. An original orchestral score for the film was written and recorded by Marius-Fran√ßois Gaillard. Robert donated his print of the film to the M√©li√®s family.

She was a national correspondent for the Washington Post for nearly two decades, writing about immigration, gay youth in the Bible Belt and U.S. soldiers coming home from the war in Iraq. Her reporting on the mistreatment of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center with fellow Post reporter Dana Priest and photographer Michel duCille brought wide-sweeping national reform. For this work, the Post was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Career Hull started as a feature writer at St. Petersburg Times in 1986. After a Tampa police officer was assaulted with a gun in a Tampa public housing project, Hull spent months in the reporting on the relationship between the police squad assigned to patrol the community and the residents who lived there. The story was told in a three-part series called \\"Metal to Bone\\" and received the American Society of Newspaper Editors Non-Deadline Writing Award in 1995. In 2000, Hull followed a group of women from Mexico to work in a North Carolina crab processing facility. The series, \\"Una Vida Mejor,\\" was a 2000 Pulitzer Prize finalist in national reporting https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/anne-hull-0 and feature writing. https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/anne-hull-0 Hull joined The Washington Post in 2000 as a national reporter. She wrote about immigration, Hurricane Katrina, gay youth, marginalized Americans and soldiers coming from Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2007, Hull and Post colleagues Dana Priest and Michel duCille reported on conditions for wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, for which the Post was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. She was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University from 1994 to 1995. She was a visiting professor of journalism at Princeton University. In 2011, she was a Berlin fellow at the American Academy in Berlin in 2011. She served on the board of trustees for the Poynter Institute For Media Studies in St. Petersburg. She has written for The New Yorker magazine. Walter Reed scandal In late 2007, Hull and Priest went behind the gates at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington to investigate the living conditions of wounded soldiers from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They found mold, rats and the neglect of outpatient soldiers who were stuck in bureaucratic limbo on the ground of Walter Reed. The stories sparked outrage, resulting in the resignation of Secretary of the Army, Francis J. Harvey. Congressional investigations were led by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), who chaired the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House and by Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), on the Senate side, who chaired the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services. Republicans and Democrats joined hands in criticizing the respective parties responsible for the conditions there. This prompted President George W. Bush to appoint former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Presidential Candidate Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS) and former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala to oversee the process of healthcare for wounded soldiers.

Their home ground is Gardiners Park and they currently compete in the . Club colours are gold and black. Founded in 1926 as an amateur side, the club stepped up to the Junior grade in 1933. In May 2020, the club confirmed they had successfully applied to join the East of Scotland Football League within the senior pyramid.Club News, Lochgelly Albert FC, 1 May 2020 History There are a couple of theories of how Lochgelly Albert started the use of 'Albert', the first being that the club was named after Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, adherents pointing to the fact that the original team colours of gold and black are the same as the Royal Livery at the time of Prince Albert's death in 1861. However, the length of time between Prince Albert's death and the setting up of the amateur club in 1926 makes this unlikely. The second theory is that the club took its name from the French town Albert, near the 1916 Somme battlefields. It is well known that more than a few young men from Lochgelly not only fought, but perished during the battle. It is reported that most of the soldiers were at some time stationed in Albert and a few not only played football before the war, but after hostilities had ceased, set about founding a local team in Lochgelly. This may have been done to try to replace the local senior team Lochgelly United who disbanded for the duration of the war. Lochgelly Albert's first football game within the Junior ranks was on 29 July 1933, away to Kirkford Juniors at Beathview Park, Cowdenbeath and resulted in a 1‚Äì0 victory to Lochgelly Albert. The goal was scored by Pat Finnerty. The club's first trophy arrived in the season 1934‚Äì35. This was the Fife Cup and the Albert were victorious over Rosslyn Juniors at Stark's Park, Kirkcaldy, the current home of Raith Rovers, the final score being 2‚Äì0 to Lochgelly Albert. The Albert were followed into the Junior ranks in 1935 by another team called Lochgelly Violet, and their first game on 29 July 1935 was away to Lochgelly Albert at Gardiner's Park. The outcome of this game was a 2‚Äì0 victory for the Albert and was watched by 2,000 local spectators. The SJFA restructured prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season, and Albert found themselves in the 12-team East Region, Central Division. They finished fourth in their first season in the division. The team have been managed since the summer of 2018 by Barry Cockburn. Record attendance The record crowd for Lochgelly Albert (and for any Junior ground in the Fife region) was 11,645 for a Scottish Junior Cup sixth round tie against Bo'ness United on 13 March 1948.

His father, Vincent Beaufils, was an anaesthetist for SAMU (a mobile accident unit). Quivrin studied film and broadcasting at Hector Berlioz college in Vincennes, before obtaining his Baccalaureat in literature and taking a course in film studies at Nanterre University. However, he soon gave up his studies in favour of launching his professional career. He spent several months at the 'Ecole des Enfants Terribles' drama school and took some further education courses. In spite of this, he always considered himself as having been self-taught. Career Quivrin's film debut came at a young age, when he played the Duke of Anjou, one of the main characters, in Roger Planchon's Louis, enfant roi (1992). The film was selected for the 1993 Cannes Festival, where Quivrin was introduced to his first agent. He appeared in several costume dramas, including Lautrec by Roger Planchon and Daniel Vigne's L'enfant des lumi√®res in 2002, opposite Nathalie Baye.

Quivrin then appeared in L'Outremangeur and in Grande Ecole. In 2005 he landed the part of Detective Nerteaux in the big-budget film L'empire des loups alongside Jean Reno. It was a huge commercial success and boosted Quivrin's career. Quivrin made his first television appearance as Babar in Les compagnons de l'aventure: Lola et les sardines, which featured a group of children on holiday in the 1990s. In 2001 he gained a certain notoriety in the eyes of the French public, playing the title role in Rastignac ou les ambitieux, Alain Tasma's TV adaptation of the novel by Honor√© de Balzac. Quivrin's performance was highly acclaimed and the newspapers were full of praise. Le Figaro called him ‚Äúflamboyant‚Äù while Le Monde found him ‚Äúextremely seductive‚Äù. He consequently received the award for Best Actor at the Television film festival in Luchon. At the same time as pursuing his career in television and film, Quivrin was also acting on stage.

He appeared at the 2008 Avignon Festival in Do you love me? a play by Redjep Mitrovistas. Quivrin had supporting roles in two internationally successful, Oscar-winning films: Elizabeth (1998) and Syriana (2005). In 99 francs, Jan Kounen's adaptation of the eponymous novel by Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder, Quivrin tackled his first comedy role. He played the colleague of Jean Dujardin, an arrogant, depressive advertising executive. His performance was deemed ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù by Le Monde and earned him the Prix Lumi√®re for Most Promising Male Newcomer, the Patrick Dewaere prize and a C√©sar nomination for Most Promising Male Newcomer in 2008. In 2006, Quivrin wrote and directed a short film entitled Acteur, which was intended to be both anecdotal and representative of the life of an actor. The film is centred on a conversation between a female director and an auditioning actor and, according to Quivrin, deals with ‚Äúthe clear separation you have to make between your personal and professional lives‚Äù. The character of the director, played by Nathalie Baye, was inspired by Catherine Breillat, whom he had met at several auditions. In 2007, he played \\"The Nansac's Count\\" in the film Jacquou Le Croquant, realised by Laurent Boutonnat. In 2008, Quivrin appeared in the film LOL with Sophie Marceau, Christa Theret and J√©r√©my Kapone and, a year later, in √Ä l'aventure by Jean-Claude Brisseau and Incognito with the singer B√©nabar and the actor Franck Dubosc. Quivrin's penultimate film, La famille Wolberg was released in France in December 2009. His final film, Ensemble, c'est trop by L√©a Fazer, was released in France in February 2010. =Death= Quivrin died in a car accident on Autoroute A13 on the evening of Sunday 15 November 2009. He had lost control of his Ariel Atom (a small but powerful open-topped, two-seater car) at the entrance of the Saint-Cloud tunnel. The speedometer was found stopped at 230 km/h (143 mph), although it is not known whether he was actually driving at this speed or it was a consequence of the violent impact. French television and newspapers have reported that the road was wet from rain at the time of the accident. His funeral took place on 21 November 2009 at the Reformed church on the Avenue de la Grande-Arm√©e in Paris. It was attended by Quivrin's close family and friends, as well as by many stars of stage and screen. Jocelyn Quivrin was buried at the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.Cimeti√®res de France et d'ailleurs Personal life He met his partner, Alice Taglioni, during the filming of Grande Ecole.

This plover is resident in much of eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar, mainly on inland rivers, pools, and lakes. Its nest is a bare scrape on shingle. This species is often seen as single individuals, but it will form small flocks. It hunts by sight for insects, worms and other invertebrates. Three-banded plovers have a sharp whistled weeet-weet call. Description The adult three-banded plover is 18 cm in length. It has long wings and a long tail, and therefore looks different from most other small plovers in flight, the exception being the closely related Forbes's plover that replaces it in west Africa. The adult three-banded plover has medium brown upperparts, and the underparts are white except for the two black breast bands, separated by a white band, which give this species its common and scientific names. The head is strikingly patterned, with a black crown, white supercilia extending from the white forehead to meet on the back of the neck, and a grey face becoming brown on the neck. The eye ring and the base of the otherwise black bill are red. The Madagascan subspecies C. t. bifrontatus has a grey band between the bill and the white forehead, and the sides of the head are grey. A genetic study reported genetic differentiation between Madagascar and the mainland population. The sexes are similar, and the juveniles of the nominate and Madagascan subspecies also resemble the adults, although the forehead is brownish for a short time. This species is distinguished from the larger, darker Forbes's plover in that the latter species has a brown forehead and lacks a white wingbar.

Their home ground is Recreation Park, with one of the largest pitches in Scottish football. Club colours are gold and black. The original Pumpherston club was formed in 1896. A club by the name of Pumpherston Rob Roy were probably the first Junior club in the village, existing for a few years in the early 1900s before Pumpherston Rangers joined the Linlithgowshire Junior League for the 1911‚Äì12 season. Success followed for the next three seasons with two East of Scotland Junior League titles, two Renton cup wins, two Leith Burgh Cup wins and a Dalmeny Cup. World War I intervened but they won the Renton Cup again in 1919 when football resumed. However, at the end of 1927‚Äì28 season with league re- organisation and the amount of West Lothian clubs dwindling, they decided to turn amateur and leave the Juniors. It was 26 years later than Pumpherston Juniors joined the Edinburgh & District League for season 1954‚Äì55. Their first success came in 1957 when they defeated Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic at Albyn Park to win the Thornton Shield and the following season they shocked Junior football by going all the way to the Scottish Junior Cup final under the leadership of captain Vince Halpin. On the way to the Final they defeated West Calder United, Dalkeith Thistle, Tranent, Thornton Hibs, and Parkhead. The Semi-Final against Baillieston in front of 10,000 at Brockville Park was drawn, but they won the replay at Celtic Park the following week to send them to Hampden Park, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to Shotts Bon Accord in front of 33,000. They were a solid mid-table club but in 1962‚Äì63 they narrowly lost the West Section title to Sauchie who went on to win the play-off against Newtongrange Star, the same season they lost Brown Cup Final to Dunbar United. The following year also saw a third-place finish. They came from nowhere in 1969‚Äì70 to win the West Section, edging out Linlithgow Rose and Bo'ness United, but lost the Championship play-off to Mid/East Section winners Arniston Rangers. The early 1970s saw erratic form, 1971‚Äì72 saw them finish third, the following season they were 15th and bottom, and the season after that, with the leagues re-organised into A and B Divisions they missed out on promotion by a single goal. They also had a run to the 5th round of the Scottish Junior Cup before being eliminated by Glasgow Perthshire. However that was their last sniff of success as the financial situation at the club was deteriorating and midway through season 1976‚Äì77 they folded. The club was re-formed and joined the East Region in 1990‚Äì91, once again bringing Junior football back to Recreation Park.

Based on the known decimal structure of the rest of the army, it seems likely that it was nominally composed of one thousand men. Its commander was called a thiufadus (also tiuphadus)., page 20. Structure It is unknown if the thiufae were ever actually called into service or if they existed only on paper. Perhaps smaller or larger units formed the actual basis of the Visigothic army. Etymology The term thiufadus derives from either the Latin devotus or the Germanic thusundifaths. The mechanism of the transmission via the latter is, however, considered impossible by some. The Latin devotus was generally applied by the Ostrogoths and Visigoths to high-ranking Goths in the Gothic language as thiwadus. Thiufadus A class of officials called the confiscatores or exactores in the Codex Theodosianus, Lex Salica, and Edictum Chilperici are referred to in the early Visigothic laws of Theudis as compulsares vel executores. In the later Visigothic laws, like the Liber Iudiciorum, they go by various titles: compulsor exercitus, servus dominicus, or thiufadus. The thiufadus was elsewhere called a vassus regis (vassal of the king) and agente in rebus. The thiufadus, however, was both a military and judicial official. His position is immediately below that of the comes (count) or vicarius (vicar): a position the same as that of the Frankish thunginus or Late Roman ducenarius. Their position in the army was above that of the centenarius (commander of a hundred), but it cannot be positively identified with the position of millenarius (commander of a thousand). The Liber Iudiciorum augmented the powers of the thiufadi. In their double capacity as general and judge they were assisted by sayos. The thiufadus, who controlled the countryside, seems to have been weaker than the counts who controlled the civitates, city districts. Notes Sources *Thompson, E. A. The Goths in Spain.

The record was released on August 22, 1975 by Columbia Records. Overview It is arguably one of his most funk-influenced albums and it represents his further departure from the \\"spacey, higher atmosphere jazz,\\" as he referred to it, of his earlier career. Hancock uses more funk based rhythms around the hi-hat, and snare drum. The tracks are characterized by short, repeated riffs by both the rhythm section, horns accompaniment, and bass lines. Man-Child features less improvisation from the whole band and more concentrated grooves with brief solos from the horns and Hancock himself on synthesizer and Fender Rhodes piano on top of the repeated riffs. This album features the addition of electric guitar to his new sound, which he started only five years prior to this album with Fat Albert Rotunda. The guitarists featured on this album were Melvin \\"Wah-Wah Watson\\" Ragin, DeWayne \\"Blackbyrd\\" McKnight and David T. Walker. Their extensive use of wah-wah pedal and accenting chords on the up- beat rather than the down-beat is what helps to give the album a distinct and funkier rhythm that is broken up by brief periods of stop-time where only the sustained chords are heard from the electric guitar with an open wah pedal. The riffs are fast-paced and energetic with repeating patterns that combine with multiple voices (i.e. horns, piano, bass, synthesizer, guitar and drums and percussion). The horn section in \\"Hang Up Your Hang-Ups\\" plays repeated riffs in unison that alternate with and are answered by electric piano, synthesizer, and electric guitar in brief periods of call and response. Paul Jackson, Bill Summers, Harvey Mason, Bennie Maupin, and Mike Clark (who replaced Harvey Mason post-1974) formed the core of the group the Headhunters with which Hancock had toured and recorded for the previous three years. This was their final album as a group.

After a barren spell, in season 2002‚Äì03 and then again in 2003‚Äì04 Sauchie won the Fife and Lothian Cup, defeating Glenrothes and then Linlithgow Rose the following season. The furthest Sauchie has gone in the Scottish Junior Cup is the quarter-final, losing 4‚Äì2 away to Newtongrange Star in 1970, then again in 2004 when after a 0‚Äì0 draw at home to Glenrothes, Sauchie were defeated 3‚Äì2 in the replay. In season 2001‚Äì02, a team composed mostly of Gairdoch United under 21s, under the guidance of Jan Woojek, brought Sauchie out of the doldrums.

Bennett (T-AK-4296) is a container ship and lead ship of her class. Originally named TNT Express, she was built by Samsung Heavy Industries in Koje, South Korea in 1984. MV Bennett is named after United States Air Force Medal of Honor recipient Captain Steven L. Bennett. The ship was a Logistics Prepositioning Ship sponsored by the US Air Force. The ship is now in commercial service after the MSC contract ended in October 2012, and was redelivered back to the owners. Previous owners Capt. Steven L. Bennett was built in 1984 as TNT Express and operated as such under charter by ABC Containerline N.V. of Antwerp, Belgium for the London-based company TNT until 1991. In 1991, ABC Containerline bought the ship and renamed her Martha II. On February 14, 1996, the ship was detained in Melbourne, Australia when ABC went into receivership. Den norske Bank of Norway bought the ship later in 1996 and renamed it Sea Pride. In 1997, the ship was bought by Sealift Incorporated of the United States and on November 20, 1997 given its current name MV Capt Steven L. Bennett. In the first quarter of 1998, Capt. Steven L. Bennett began her prepositioning service under MPS Squadron One in the Mediterranean and as such became MV Capt Steven L. Bennett (T-AK-4296). History Capt. Steven L. Bennett started her Air Force Prepositioning Program career in the Mediterranean Sea, with a mission to \\"support the prepositioning requirements of the Department of Defense by transporting U.S. Air Force ammunition.\\" The contract, awarded to owner and operator Sealift Incorporated, of Oyster Bay, New York was for $41,823,500 with \\"reimbursables that could bring the cumulative value of this contract to $47,400,000.\\" In 1999, Bennett was involved in the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, where she \\"off-loaded more than two-thirds of her cargo of U.S. Air Force ammunition containers in Nordenham, Germany, which was distributed to the United Kingdom, Italy and other locations within Germany -- quickly replenishing the Air Force's stockpile in theater.\\" When the original contract expired in fiscal year 2002, Capt. Steven L. Bennett \\"competed for and won a new five-year contract and redeployed to the Mediterranean in October.\\" Capt. Steven L. Bennett, as a ship carrying Air Force cargo, was used extensively during fiscal year 2002 to support Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the global war on terrorism. Capt. Steven L. Bennett stays near Diego Garcia for months on end Capt. Steven L. Bennett had an eventful 2003. Still assigned to MPS Squadron One, she started the year in the Mediterranean. In April, she delivered cargo to the Persian Gulf and continued on to Diego Garcia. In July, she returned briefly to the United States, stopping en route in Northern Europe to drop off and load additional cargo. In late 2003, Vice Adm. David Brewer III, commander of Military Sealift Command, awarded the officers and crewmembers of Bennett the Merchant Marine Expeditionary Medal. Capt. Steven L. Bennett spent much of her time at anchor in the lagoon of Diego Garcia, and was spotted in New Orleans, Louisiana in early 2005. As of 2013, the ship running in world-wide service in the spot cargo trade. Ship specifics Capt. Steven L. Bennett includes cranes and advanced environmental controls Capt. Steven L. Bennetts side number, T-AK-4296, gives some information about her. The letter T indicates that it is \\"assigned to Commander, Military Sealift Command as a type commander.\\" The letters \\"AK\\" are reserved for cargo ships. In fact, Bennett is actually a conbulker, a flexible design allowing it to carry both containerized and bulk cargo. Fully loaded, it can carry 1,922 containers. Capt. Steven L. Bennett, like all MSC container ships, is self-sustaining, meaning that she has cranes which allow her to move cargo without depending on shore-based equipment. This allows Capt. Steven L.

Palmer was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1889. He grew up always wanted to act, and in 1909, at the age of 20, he made his vaudeville debut at the Palace Theater in Chicago. Just a few years later, Palmer rose to stardom, acting in comedies and musicals by himself, until late 1916 when he teamed up with Joanne 'Jo' Hayden. Their act, \\"Palmer & Hayden\\", stayed together until they retired from show business in the 1920s. In mid-1917, the two became engaged. In September 1917, Hayden's good friend Danny Metcalf, who was supposed to finish medical school, was drafted into the U.S. Army, and was killed in action in World War I on September 29 of that year. Shortly after, Palmer was also drafted into the Army, just before he and Hayden were going to play at The Palace in New York City. Palmer did not want to go to war and purposely damaged his hand so he would not have to go to France. Hayden was going to leave Palmer if he did not serve, so Palmer tried enlisting, but none of the armed services would accept him because of his hand. However, Palmer was accepted to the Red Cross ambulance corps and went overseas in early 1918. Hayden did not leave him or stop the engagement. Palmer saw action in France at Cantigny, the second Battle of Marne, Soissons, Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne. Palmer was shot in the shoulder, but survived the war and was discharged from service in 1919. Palmer and Hayden returned to vaudeville in 1919, and also got married that same year, but did not do many shows afterward. They retired from vaudeville in the early 1920s. In 1942, Gene Kelly and Judy Garland player Palmer and Hayden in the MGM musical film For Me and My Gal, directed by Busby Berkeley. The story of the film closely followed the actual events surrounding Palmer's involvement in the First World War, although some details were changed for dramatic purposes, such as making \\"Danny\\" Hayden's brother dying in the war instead of a friend. Danny's last name was also used for the character \\"Jimmy Metcalf\\", the rival for Hayden's affections. Harry Palmer died in 1962, at the age of 73.

Lamaison played most of his rugby as a centre, and possessed reliable distribution and kicking skills, which made up for his only real weakness, a lack of pace. He could also play at fly-half. He made his international debut against South Africa on 30 November 1996 in Paris, and rose to prominence as a key member of France's Grand slam-winning sides of 1997 and 1998. His goalkicking ability also helped Brive win the Heineken Cup in 1997 and reach the final in 1998. Lamaison's finest hour came at the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the semifinal against New Zealand at Twickenham. Selected at fly-half for the match, Lamaison scored a full house of points and set up several tries. He scored the first try of the game, but New Zealand hit back, with Jonah Lomu scoring two tries, to lead 24-10 in the second half.

He played college football for the University of Alabama, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round, sixth overall, of the 2009 NFL Draft. He has also played for the Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals. Early years Smith was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He attended Huffman High School in Birmingham, where he played football and competed in track. In football, he was a three-year starter, a two-time All-State selection, and Class 6A Lineman of the Year in 2005. After registering 88 pancake blocks his senior season, Smith was selected \\"Mr. Football\\" by the Alabama Sports Writers Association, becoming the only offensive lineman to ever win the honor in the association's 23-year history. Smith earned High School All-American honors by USA Today and was selected to play in the 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. He was also one of four finalists for the 2005 Walter Payton Trophy, given to the nation's most athletic high school football player. In addition to football, Smith also participated in track and field at Huffman. As a senior in 2006, Smith competed in the throwing events at the State Track & Field Meet, where he registered throws of 14.81 meters (48'7.25\\") in the shot put and 39.62 meters in the discus throw (126'8\\") that earned him sixth and eleventh-place finishes, respectively.http://dnn.ahsaa.com/Sports/IndividualSports/TrackField/History/StateTrackFieldResults/StateTrackField2006Results/2006StateTrackFieldMeetResultsClass6AB/tabid/2328/Default.aspx 2006 State Track & Field Meet Results \\\\- 6A Boys =Recruiting= Regarded as a five-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Smith was listed as the No. 1 offensive lineman by both recruiting services. Rivals described him as \\"one of the most dominant offensive line prospects in the last 10 years,\\" and‚Äîafter reevaluating their 2005‚Äì'09 rankings in February 2009‚Äîconsidered him the best offensive tackle prospect of that period. Mike Farrell of The Sporting News called Smith \\"the best offensive line prospect since Orlando Pace.\\" College career Smith attended the University of Alabama beginning in 2006. He played for coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2006 to 2008. In his initial year at Alabama, he started all 13 games at left tackle, becoming only the fourth true freshman offensive lineman to start for the Crimson Tide. Smith played at least 65 snaps in 10 of 13 games and played more than 70 snaps five times, while leading the Crimson Tide with 62 pancake blocks. He also scored a touchdown off of a lateral in the 34‚Äì31 Independence Bowl loss against Oklahoma State. Smith earned Freshman All- American honors by the Football Writers Association of America. In 2007, Smith was a first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection, after starting every game at the left tackle position. He was named Alabama Co-Player of the Week four times during the season. Smith was recognized as a unanimous All-American in 2008, as well as the 2008 Outland Trophy winner. He was also considered to be one of the best underclassmen for the 2009 NFL Draft. He was also a first- team All-SEC selection and shared the league's Jacobs Blocking Trophy with Arkansas center Jonathan Luigs. He led the team with 103 key knockdowns and added seven blocks downfield. He was penalized just twice and he allowed just one QB sack and six pressures on 334 pass plays. On December 29, 2008, Smith was suspended from playing in the 2009 Sugar Bowl,‚Äîa game Alabama lost 31‚Äì17 to the Utah Utes‚Äî, reportedly because he dealt with an agent. A few days later, Smith declared himself eligible for the 2009 NFL Draft, and at the time he was considered a lock to be a Top 5 pick. =College awards and honors= * 2006 SEC All-Freshman First Team * 2007 AP All-SEC First Team * 2007 Playboy All-American * 2008 Outland Trophy * 2008 AP All-SEC First Team * 2008 AP All- American * 2008 AFCA All-American * 2008 CBS All-American * 2008 ESPN All- American * 2008 FWAA All-American * 2008 Pro Football Weekly All-American * 2008 Rivals.com All-American * 2008 Sporting News All-American * 2008 Sports Illustrated All-American * 2008 Walter Camp All-American Professional career =2009 NFL Draft= Widely believed to be the best run-blocking tackle in the 2009 NFL Draft, Smith drew comparisons to Jason Peters. At the 2009 NFL Combine, Smith weighed 332 pounds. He also looked out of shape as he ran 40 yards shirtless, clocking at a slow 5.28, and had a disappointing 19 repetitions on the bench with 225 pounds. He decided to leave the combine early in order to prepare for Alabama's Pro Day on March 11, 2009. Smith, however, did not inform his group leader at the combine before he left, and later apologized, stating: \\"If I had the chance to do it all over, I wouldn't have handled it the way I did. I should have told my group leader that I was leaving, and I didn't. I didn't mean to ruffle any feathers or step on any toes. I didn't mean to grandstand anyone at the combine. That was not my intention at all, and I apologize for my mistake.\\" Smith also admitted that he wasn't prepared or in shape. His Pro Day performance at Alabama on March 11, 2009, was equally unimpressive, although his weight was down to 325 pounds. It was expected that his poor performances at the Combine and at Pro Day would strongly impact his draft positioning. Initially thought of as the best offensive tackle in the draft and a possible No. 1 pick, Smith was moved to third among offensive tackles (commonly behind Jason Smith and Eugene Monroe) after the combine. =Cincinnati Bengals= 2009 season Smith was eventually drafted sixth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. He was the first Alabama offensive lineman selected in the first round of an NFL Draft since Chris Samuels in 2000. With run-blocking being his premier quality, Smith was projected to start at right tackle for the Bengals. However, after a 30-day contract impasse, Smith missed all of training camp and three preseason games, before eventually signing his contract on August 30, 2009. It is believed that Smith was looking for a five-year, $40 million deal, but was signed to a four- year contract with only $21 million guaranteed. The Bengals also had an option in his contract after the 2010 season to make it a six-year, $42 million agreement. Just days after ending his holdout, Smith fractured his left foot during a non-contact drill at training camp in his first week of practice after missing most of preseason. He was on roster exemption for the season opener game against the Denver Broncos on September 13, then was added to the active roster the next day and returned to practice in week 7, being inactive for Games 2-10. He played in Games 11‚Äì16, and was credited with one start. He made his NFL debut on November 29 against the Cleveland Browns. On December 13, 2009, Smith was credited with his first official start when usual starting right tackle Dennis Roland lined up as the extra tight end in the Bengals unbalanced line. He supported three individual 100-yard rushing efforts over the season's final six games, and aided a Bengals playoff record of 169 rushing yards by running back Cedric Benson in the wild card playoff game against the New York Jets. 2010 season In his second season with the Bengals, Smith claimed the starting right tackle position, playing in Weeks 6, 7, and 8, but then suffered a foot fracture (fifth metatarsal) in practice on November 10, forcing the Bengals to place him on injured reserve with a broken foot and effectively ending his season after playing in seven of the eight regular season games to that date.http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/11/13/bengals-officially-end- andre-smiths-season/ 2011 season In the 2011 preseason, it was reported that Smith was working out and getting fully fit. It was also reported that in the preseason, he spoke with the Bengals starting left tackle, Andrew Whitworth, about how \\"it's my time to step up.\\" The 2011 season became Smith's breakout year, and he became the starting right tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals. He started there in games 1-12 and 15‚Äì16, as well as the wild card playoff game, contributing to pass protection that ranked tied for fourth in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed (25). He was inactive for games 13-14 due to an ankle injury. In week 1 at Cleveland, he averted a giveaway by recovering an Andy Dalton fumble at the Bengals eight-yard line. In week 6 against the Indianapolis Colts, he supported a pass-protection effort that held the Colts for the first time on the season without a sack, playing primarily against All-Pro defensive end Robert Mathis. He aided a 165-yard rushing effort in week 16 against the Arizona Cardinals. 2012 season In 2012, Smith started all 16 games, including the wild card playoff game. He helped running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rank first in the league in third- and-one rushing conversions (93.3 percent success rate, on 14 of 15) and was part of a run-blocking effort for Green-Ellis to gain at least 100 yards four times in a five-game stretch (Games 10-12 and 14), with 168.2 team average in that span. He also supported a season-best 221 rushing yards, with 6.5 average, on November 25 against the Oakland Raiders. 2013 season 2013. On April 26, 2013, Smith re-signed with the Bengals. It was reported by NFL.com's Ian Rapoport that Smith agreed to a three-year, $18 million contract during the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He started in games 1-11 and 13‚Äì16 at right tackle, and came off bench in week 12, helping the Bengals rank tied for sixth in scoring and tenth in net offense. He was a key cog in pass protection, allowing only one sack over games 11‚Äì14, tying a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a four-game span. On September 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he helped the offensive line allow no sacks with 407 net yards. He aided a blocking effort in week 6 at Buffalo in which the Bengals offense tallied a season-high in total net yards with 483 yards, including season-highs in both rushing (165) and passing (318). On October 27 against the New York Jets, he contributed to pass protection allowing only one sack for two yards as Andy Dalton threw for a career-best five touchdown passes. In week 14 against Indianapolis, he helped keep Dalton sack-free for the third straight game and supported a 155-yard rushing effort, and Dalton was named AFC Offensive Player of Week with a 120.5 passer rating. In the wild card playoff game on January 5, 2014, he contributed to a 439-yard offensive output against the San Diego Chargers. 2014 season Smith missed all of the 2014 preseason while rehabbing from a concussion, but was able to start in the season opener game. He played and started in nine games played on the season. He was inactive for games 9-10, and was placed on Reserve/Injured list on November 25, following a triceps injury suffered in week 11. He played a key role in the Bengals pass protection for the nine games he played, helping the Bengals finish the season ranked third in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed with 23 and in least sack yardage allowed (123 yards). He was part of an offensive line that allowed no sacks in the first three weeks of the season for first time in franchise history. He was credited by coaches with the key block on Giovani Bernard‚Äôs 89-yard touchdown run, the second-longest in Bengals history, on October 12 against the Carolina Panthers. He helped pave the way for three one-yard touchdown runs in goal line situations in week 8 against the Baltimore Ravens, including the game-winning touchdown by Andy Dalton on a fourth-and-one situation late in the fourth quarter. 2015 season Smith started in 14 games (Games 1-7 and 10-16) at right tackle, and also started wild card playoff game. He missed games 8-9 due to a concussion suffered on November 1 at Pittsburgh. On September 13 at Oakland, he helped lead pass protection that allowed no sacks and supported 396 yards of net offense. The following week, he contributed with a second straight sack-free game against the San Diego Chargers, in which the rushing offense put up 175 yards on the ground. In week 3, he provided pass protection for Andy Dalton to register a career-high 383 yards on September 27 against the Baltimore Ravens. The next week against the Kansas City Chiefs, he provided a key block for a 13-yard touchdown run by Giovani Bernard and helped allow no sacks as Bengals posted the first game in franchise history with more than 300 net passing yards (321) and four rushing touchdowns. On October 11 against the Seattle Seahawks, he helped the offense accumulate 419 total yards and score 17 points in the fourth quarter to overcome a 24‚Äì7 deficit. In week 6 at Buffalo, he helped allow no sacks as Andy Dalton posted 118.6 passer rating, with three scores and no interceptions. He supported a season-high passer rating (146.8) for Andy Dalton on December 6 at Cleveland, with only one sack allowed. On Dec 20 at San Francisco, he supported a 115.6 passer rating for AJ McCarron in his first NFL start. =Minnesota Vikings= On March 18, 2016, Smith signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings worth up to $3.5 million with $500,000 guaranteed. Smith's first season with the Vikings was cut short after suffering a season-ending triceps injury in Week 4. On October 11, 2016, he was placed on injured reserve. =Return to Cincinnati Bengals= On March 14, 2017, Smith signed a one-year contract to return to the Bengals.

Lake Reynerie at Le Mirail, seen from the neighboring park. University of Toulouse-Jean Jaur√®s () has been known by this name since 2014. Formerly called Universit√© de Toulouse-Le Mirail or UTM, it is one of 3 universities in Toulouse, France. The campus, situated in Toulouse's grand architectural project of the 1960s, Le Mirail, was conceived and built by the team of architects Candilis, Josic, Woods. Mirail University was hastily conceived as a result of the saturation of the original buildings in the city centre and the events of May 1968. At that time it was decided to divide the University of Toulouse into three: The law faculty became Universit√© Toulouse I, occupying all the old university buildings, the humanities faculty became Universit√© de Toulouse II ‚Äì Le Mirail, named after its new location, and the departments of science and medicine became Universit√© Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III). In 1969, a fourth university in Toulouse was created, Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, a school of engineering. After the opening of many extensions (one of which was situated in military barracks) in order to free up the university in the city centre, the campus in Le Mirail opened one section at a time starting in 1971, and completed the transfer by 1973. Planned for 11,000 students, the university today is a victim of its own success, with a student population of roughly 27,500. As the humanities university of Toulouse, it is organised into many pedagogical components: UFRs (unit√©s de formation et de recherche) and university institutes. It is also host to a number of student groups and associations, including the theater troupe Les Soeurs Fatales and the irreverent student-run newspaper The Mariner.

It is a major prostaglandin produced by mast cells ‚Äì recruits Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils. In mammalian organs, large amounts of PGD2 are found only in the brain and in mast cells. It is critical to development of allergic diseases such as asthma. Research carried out in 1989 found PGD2 is the primary mediator of vasodilation (the \\"niacin flush\\") after ingestion of niacin (nicotinic acid). A 2012 research paper indicates a causal link between elevated levels of localized PGD2 and hair growth inhibition. Applied topically, the researchers found PGD2 prevents hair growth, and mice that were genetically inclined to produce higher levels of PGD2 had inhibited hair growth. The researchers also found PGD2 levels were much higher in balding scalp tissue than nonbalding scalp tissue, through increased levels of prostaglandin D2 synthase. The paper suggested that inhibition of hair growth involved binding of PGD2 to a receptor called GPR44, and that GPR44 therefore would be a therapeutic target for androgenic alopecia in both men and women with hair loss and thinning. Because PGD2's relation to asthma has been known for several years, several drugs that seek to reduce the effect of PGD2 through blocking the GPR44 are already in clinical trials. Production *Cellular synthesis occurs through the arachidonic acid cascade with the final conversion from PGH2 done by PGD2 synthase (PTGDS). *In the brain, production occurs via an alternative pathway through the soluble, secreted enzyme Œ≤-trace Effects *PGD2 causes a contraction of the bronchial airways. Its concentration in asthma patients is 10 times higher than in control patients, especially after it is brought into contact with allergens. *It is involved in the regulation of reducing body temperature in sleep, and acts opposite to PGE2 . *It causes vasoconstriction *Elevated levels of PGD2 and PGD2 synthase in scalp hair follicles may be partially responsible for male pattern baldness. *PGD2 also plays a part in male sexual development. It forms a feedforward loop with Sox9, which is activated by the SRY of the Y chromosome. PGD2, in a different feedforward loop than FGF9, helps keep the level of SOX9 high enough to activate other genes, such as Fgf9 and Sf1, which are necessary for the development of the male reproductive system *PGD2 plays a role in the attraction of neutrophils (chemotaxis).

Aska is best known for work as part of the music duo Chage and Aska. As a composer, he wrote most of the principal hit songs for the duo, such as \\"Morning Moon\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Say Yes\\", and \\"Meguriai\\". Over half of their released singles were written by him. He has also written for many singers and groups in addition to Chage and Aska. In particular, his songwriting for Hikaru Genji in the late 1980s produced some of his most notable works. He began a solo career in 1987, and was highly successful in the first half of the 1990s. His most well-known song as a solo singer is \\"Hajimari wa Itsumo Ame\\" (The Start Is Always Rain), which was a single from his second solo album. The song reached No. 2 on oricon and sold over 1,160,000 copies. Success of this song lead him to widespread popularity across East Asia.https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/05/19/aska-drug-use- answers-to-some-questions/ He was arrested in May 2014 for possession of the illegal stimulant MDMA. On 12 September 2014, he was given a three-year jail sentence that was suspended for four years. He restarted his career in 2017. In 2019, Aska has announced withdrawal from the Chage and Aska. Stage name origin Initially, it was thought that his stage name was derived from the Ryo Asuka character of the Devilman manga series by Go Nagai. Aska later denied this, explaining that his name was derived from \\"Asuka,\\" the name a female radio DJ in Fukuoka, who was the object of his unrequited love during college. When he thought about his stage name, he used Aska to get back at the DJ. At first, the English notation of his name was Ryo Asuka, but this was often mispronounced, so Asuka was changed to Aska.

Collaboratively, researchers and laypeople review potential vaccines for safety, immune response, and efficacy. The HVTN is a network for testing vaccines, and while its members may also work in vaccine development for other entities, the mission of the HVTN does not include vaccine design. The HVTN is the only HIV vaccine research network sponsored by the American government. It also manages the only large-scale HIV vaccine research trial network in Africa. The HVTN collaborates with the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS). Funding comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and National Institutes of Health, which oversee DAIDS. HVTN is headquartered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. The vaccines being tested come from various producers, both commercial and non-profit. Community involvement Typically, researchers conduct clinical research on human subjects by asking volunteers to give informed consent to participate in an experiment by taking drugs that have not always been proven safe or effective in humans, though their safety has been tested (usually in animals) prior to any human trials. At the HVTN, many current vaccine studies are using products with a safety record that has been established in previous human trials. The Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report are legal documents written in layman's terms which local governments use to model their laws for establishing rules for conducting clinical trials, and all contemporary clinical trials of international worth follow all the rules set by these precedents. However, HIV vaccine research requires more than just these protections, and because of this, from the inception of their research the HVTN has instituted a \\"community advisory board\\" (CAB) system in addition to the usual controls. The CAB is similar to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in that the researchers facilitate the granting of public data to both entities, but the difference is that the IRB consists of a professional ethics committee and the CAB consists of any community member who wants to supervise the safety, ethics, efficacy, or any other aspect of the research. The researchers of the HVTN deemed the creation of the CAB necessary for HIV vaccine research when it has not been necessary for other clinical research because the HIV epidemic is especially urgent, new research techniques are available now that did not exist before recent major advances in genetic engineering, the public is generally overly- willing to volunteer to receive experimental vaccines for this cause, and yet the educational infrastructure already in place to disseminate information about the inherent risk in participating in vaccine research is lacking in society. For too many reasons, there is no precedent for research of this sort on this scale, and without integrating educational programs about this research into existing community institutions, the HVTN simply could not educate people to the required level to make such a fast-moving, expensive, inherently non-commercial research project possible. African HIV vaccine trials * In 2003 the HVTN partnered with Harvard University in establishing a small-scale vaccine trials unit in Botswana. A major reason for this project was gathering data about the HIV prevalence in Africa and assessing the feasibility of getting grassroots support for vaccine trials. * In 2007 the HVTN started the first large-scale HIV vaccine trials in Africa, called HVTN 503/Phambili, with financial assistance from the SA Aids Vaccine Initiative. Phambili was halted in 2007 due to its similarity to the ineffective vaccine used in the American STEP study. * In 2011, the HVTN collaborated with South African researcher Glenda Gray on a trial called HVTN 097 which is the only study outside Thailand to test the pox-protein vaccine regimen that had been found to be partially efficacious in the RV144 trial. *Since 2016, the HVTN is collaborating with African researchers and communities on multiple HIV vaccine efficacy trials in Africa, including HVTN 702 which tests a pox-protein vaccine regimen, HVTN 703 (AMP) which tests passive immunisation, and HVTN 705 (Imbokodo) which tests a global antigen vaccine. American HIV vaccine trials * HVTN 502/ STEP was the name for a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in the US and managed by the HVTN. It was thoroughly reviewed when more participants in the experimental group contracted HIV than participants in the control group. The vaccine contained no HIV and no one could have contracted HIV from the vaccine, but there was intense discussion as to whether the vaccine could have increased anyone's risk of contracting HIV. Because the study was stopped early, it probably will never be possible to determine why more participants in the experimental group contracted HIV, but various theories have been proposed. * In October 2009, the HVTN began a clinical trial in the USA called HVTN 505. HVTN 505 tested whether two vaccines, a DNA plasmid vaccine plus a recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine (DNA/rAd5), could prevent HIV. The vaccines were developed for HIV subtypes A, B and C by the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In April 2013, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping vaccinations because there was no evidence that the vaccines could prevent people from getting HIV. The vaccines could also not treat HIV. The vaccines were, however, found to be safe and well tolerated.

The band started to emerge in the late '90s in the eastern Finnish town of Kuopio where the drummer Sampa V√§√§t√§inen and the singer Artturi Taira began playing together joined later by the keyboardist/guitarist Samuli P√∂yh√∂nen. They became Rubik in 2003 when they played their first live show. The band released their debut EP People Go Missing in 2004 through New Music Community, causing a stir in the indie scene. The band's first full-length album, titled Bad Conscience Patrol, was released in March 2007 through Fullsteam Records and met with excitement in Finland. Following the release, the band toured in Finland, the US and Canada and performed at European festivals. Their second album entitled Dada Bandits was released on April 1, 2009. In the review of the album Spin Magazine wrote: \\"ADHD'd Finns explode piano balladry, spacey synths, drum blarts, mariachi brass, and a hypnotic chorus, then let the pieces fall into place\\". \\"Listening to Dada Bandits, it's hard not to feel that Rubik's done more-rather than following international trends, they're showing us all the way forward\\", wrote Nylon Magazine.

The same summer the band played at all the major festivals in Finland. In September 2011 Rubik began a two-month tour heading to Europe, Mexico's Cervantino festival and the US playing 38 concerts altogether. The band has been acclaimed for its devoted performance. In concerts there are up to ten musicians on stage playing instruments from the clockwork to the gong and exchanging them with each other. Also when writing and recording songs Rubik tries to abandon traditional roles in the band and aims for a more ego-free and collective process focused on ideas.http://mashable.com/2011/05/02/rubik/ On November 11, 2013 bandleader Artturi Taira announced via the band's official Facebook page that the group had decided to disband with a farewell concert planned for December 20.https://www.facebook.com/rubikband/posts/10153455853770580 Rubik released their final music video for the song \\"We Are Like Fallen Leaves\\" (from the \\"Tehdas: Fake Music Mixtape\\" release) two days after this farewell concert on December 22.

He was one of the earliest proponents of UK garage music, hosting a long- running Kiss 100 radio show and mixing the Pure Garage series of compilations.  Biography  DJ EZ was born in London and raised in Tottenham, North London. His early discovery and love of house, hip hop and electro led to listening to pirate radio and recording early mixes in the hope to land a show on them. = Radio = DJ EZ first started DJing on the pirate radio station Dance 93FM, playing house music. At this time, he was known as Easy O. When the station was shutdown, EZ set up his own station based in North London called Dimension FM, which was short-lived. In 1994, EZ submitted a demo tape to then leading London house and garage pirate radio station Freek FM 101.8, which led to him hosting a 4-hour Saturday and Sunday mornings. It was also at this time that he changed his DJ name to EZ. EZ's first appearances on commercial radio were to cover for Steve Jackson and Bobby & Steve's shows on Kiss 100. He was then asked to cover for Tuff Jam when they were unable to make their show, and in November 1999, this led to Kiss offering a permanent show on Tuesday mornings 2-4am. Shortly after, he was given a primetime show on Saturday nights 7-9pm called \\"Saturday Satisfaction\\", and then another show on Friday nights 10-11pm called \\"The Hour of Power\\". The Friday night show would then become called \\"Destination Weekend\\" from 10pm-12am, and in 2002, the Saturday show moved to 5-7pm. From March to November 2008, EZ hosted a Saturday show called \\"The Bassline Mix\\" from 10-11pm across the Kiss Network. The show featured UK garage and bassline anthems in the mix. From March to September 2014, EZ hosted a 3-hour Thursday night show from 9pm-12am. On 4 September 2014, he announced that his Kiss radio show had finally come to an end after 14 years on air. = Club career and awards = DJ EZ started his own weekly club night called Club Z at the Gass Club in Leicester Square. As the UK garage scene broke mainstream, he has been synonymous with raves and nights such as Exposure, Twice As Nice, Garage Nation, Pure Silk, Sun City, Frisky and Club Sidewinder. EZ has won many awards over the years, including 'Club DJ of the Year' at the 1998 Underground Garage Awards, 'Best DJ' at the 2000 and 2002 UK Garage Awards, and 'Best DJ', 'Best Old School DJ' and 'Best Radio Show' at the 2004 People's Choice Music Awards in London. = 24-hour charity set = On 10 February 2016, DJ EZ announced that he would be playing a 24-hour set, with all proceeds going to Cancer Research UK. This took place on 27‚Äì28 February 2016, and was live streamed on his website and Boiler Room. = Production = DJ EZ has released a number of his own productions, and is especially known for his remix of the B-15 Project track \\"Feels So Good\\". He is also well known for compiling and mixing the long-running Pure Garage mixed compilation series.  Discography  = Singles and EPs = * 4 Track E.P.

GAINSCO‚Äôs insurance operation was originally chartered as an underwriter of Commercial risks; operations that were discontinued and placed in a run-off in 2002. The Company marketed its commercial insurance through managing general agents, using ‚ÄúGAINSCO‚Äù and the block super-scribed letters ‚ÄúGA‚Äù as its primary logo identifiers. These were derived from the abbreviated version of the name of the Company‚Äôs its primary insurance subsidiary at that time, General Agents Insurance Company of America, Inc. This commercial insurance company was sold in 2007. An acquisition in the late 1990s of a Florida-based managing general agency and claims operation specializing in the non-standard personal automobile business established the cornerstone for GAINSCO‚Äôs insurance marketing focus today. The Company completed a capital restructuring in 2005 which set the base for developing its business model. It consolidated its headquarters in Dallas, Texas in 2005. The Company, through its insurance brand, GAINSCO Auto Insurance¬Æ, specializes in minimum-limits personal auto coverage and actively distributes its nonstandard personal auto products through independent retail agents in Southwest and Sunbelt states. Its insurance company subsidiary (domiciled in Texas) is MGA Insurance Company, Inc., and sponsors the No. 99 Red Dragon‚Ñ¢ McLaren 650s GT3 GAINSCO/Bob Stallings‚Ñ¢ racecar. In addition, the Company owns and operates a franchised Hyundai automobile dealership in Dallas, Texas. Beginning in 2005, a newly created GAINSCO logo mark incorporated a rising arrow in its name to inspire a progressively upward company. It was at this time that GAINSCO‚Äôs logo mark was first placed on a racecar owned by our Chairman of the Board, Robert Stallings. Registered marks include GAINSCO Auto Insurance¬Æ and Are You Driven¬Æ. The Company‚Äôs insurance business has grown from a gross premiums written level of $112 million in 2005 to $227 million in 2015. Total shareholders‚Äô equity (on a GAAP basis) increased from $57 million to $96 million over the same period. In addition, during this time period the A.M. Best rating of the insurance subsidiary has increased three times moving from a ‚ÄúVulnerable‚Äù financial strength rating of ‚ÄúB-‚Äù to the current ‚ÄúSecure‚Äù financial strength rating of ‚ÄúB++‚Äù with a stable outlook. The entry into the automobile dealership business in late 2013 provided another avenue for expansion opportunities. The Company in early 2011 approved the voluntary suspension of its duty to file reports with the SEC and the voluntary deregistration of its common stock. The Company was eligible to suspend its reporting obligations and deregister its common stock because there were fewer than 300 holders of record of the Company‚Äôs common stock. This decision resulted in expense savings and reduced reporting burdens. The GAINSCO leadership team is deep in industry talent and expertise. Robert Stallings, GAINSCO‚Äôs Chairman, has a successful track record of building and managing financial services companies and is actively involved in the strategic leadership and organizational management. Glenn Anderson, CEO and President, has enjoyed significant success over his thirty-year career in the insurance industry. A former Executive Vice President and Divisional President with USF&G;, Mr. Anderson joined GAINSCO in 1998. The Company‚Äôs Board of Directors and named Executive Officers own a significant majority of the outstanding common stock. GAINSCO‚Äôs insurance operations consist of about 400 employees with about 250 employees in its Dallas home office. A separate Miami office has approximately 80 employees; the balance of the employee population is field based across the multiple states of operation. The automobile dealership operation, located in South Dallas, has approximately 45 employees. In 2019, GAINSCO has chosen One Inc., for modernisation of the outbound payment capacities of the company. On September 17, 2020, State Farm Insurance announced an agreement to acquire Gainsco as a wholly owned subsidiary for $400 million.

It was composed between August 18 and October 8, 1887, and was premiered in Prague on January 6, 1888. The quintet is acknowledged as one of the masterpieces in the form, along with those of Schumann, Brahms and Shostakovich.Berger, . Background The work was actually composed as the result of the composer‚Äôs attempt to revise an earlier work, Piano Quintet in A major, Op. 5. Dvo≈ô√°k was dissatisfied with the Op. 5 quintet and destroyed the manuscript not long after its premiere. Fifteen years later, he reconsidered and retrieved a copy of the score from a friend and started making revisions. However, he decided that rather than submitting the revised work for publication, he would compose an entirely new work. The new quintet is a mixture of Dvo≈ô√°k's personal form of expressive lyricism with elements from Czech folk music. Characteristically, those elements include styles and forms of song and dance, but not actual folk tunes; Dvo≈ô√°k created original melodies in the authentic folk style. Structure The music has four movements: It has a duration of approximately 40 minutes. The first movement opens quietly with lyrical cello theme over piano accompaniment which is followed by a series of elaborate transformations. The viola introduces the second subject which is another lyrical melody, but much busier than the cello's stately line. Both themes are developed extensively by the first and second violins and the movement closes with a free recapitulation and an exuberant coda. The second movement is labeled Dumka which is a form that Dvo≈ô√°k famously used in his Dumky piano trio and features a melancholy theme on the piano separated by fast, happy interludes. It follows a seven-part rondo pattern, ABACABA, where A, in F minor, is the slow elegiac refrain on piano with variations, B is a bright D major section on violins, and C is a quick and vigorous section derived from the opening refrain. Each time the Dumka (A) section returns its texture is enriched.In the seventh song of the P√≠snƒõ milostn√© (Love Songs) of 1883, the song \\"The Sweet Power of Your Eyes\\" (), a cycle based partially on the early song-cycle Cyp≈ôi≈°e, Dvo≈ô√°k uses the \\"A\\" theme from the quintet's slow movement liberally in the piano accompaniment. In this case the song is a revised version of the second song of the original cycle. In a recording by Rudolf Firkusny and Gabriela Be≈àaƒçkov√° from 1991, the Dumka theme first appears fifteen seconds into the -minute song. The third movement is marked as a Furiant which is a fast Bohemian folk dance. The cello and viola alternate a rhythmic pizzicato underneath the main tune of the first violin. The slower trio section of the scherzo is also derived from the furiant theme, with the piano and violin alternating between the main melodies. The fast Bohemian folk dance returns and the movement finishes aggressively, setting up for the polka in the last movement. The Finale is light-hearted and spirited. The second violin leads the theme into a fugue in the development section. In the coda, Dvo≈ô√°k writes tranquilloSee MacDonald. for a chorale-like section, which features the theme of the movement this time in augmentation and played pianissimo, before the pace quickens with an accelerando, and the quintet rushes to the finish.

Tornado families are sometimes mistaken as a single continuous tornado, especially prior to the 1970s. Sometimes the tornado tracks can overlap and expert analysis is necessary to determine whether or not damage was created by a family or a single tornado. In some cases, such as the Hesston-Goessel, Kansas tornadoes of March 1990, different tornadoes of a tornado family merge, making discerning whether an event was continuous or not more difficult. Some tornado damage remains a mystery even today due to a lack of evidence. The Tri-State Tornado of March 1925 was one such tornado. It could either have been the longest single tornado recorded or a family of tornadoes. A thorough re-analyses project found that it was probably one continuous tornado for most of its path, likely bounded by separate tornadoes at the beginning and end of the very long track (VLT) tornado, and likely another significant tornado spawned many miles later. However, many other exceptionally VLT events were later found to be tornado families with much shorter tornado path segments than originally thought, notably the Woodward, Oklahoma tornado family of April 1947 and the Charleston-Mattoon, Illinois tornado family of May 1917. Tornado families can be a result of satellite tornadoes, cyclic tornadogenesis, or some combination thereof. Intense downbursts may also cause damage paths to appear continuous, although this was more an issue for historic tornadoes as such damage usually is now distinguishable as from straight-line winds. Especially when newly forming, tornadoes may sometimes exhibit brief breaks in the damage path even as the parent circulation is continuous. Such events may be considered as \\"skipping\\", a term that originally referred to what now is typically a tornado family. Successive tornadoes may be considered by some as separate tornadoes (and thus constituting a tornado family) only when spawned by a new tornadocyclone or low-level mesocyclone (and wall cloud).

Founded by mechanical engineer Mark Serbu, the company is best known for producing the BFG 50 a .50 BMG caliber, single-shot rifle. The rifle is also available in .510 DTC EUROP caliber in some European countries, where .50 BMG rifles are generally banned by law. Products The BFG-50 is a .50 BMG rifle designed to be an affordable, single shot bolt-action rifle. The company is currently shipping a semi-automatic .50 BMG rifle called the BFG-50A. Production startup had been slow; prototype photos of the BFG-50A were first shown in 2002, and orders were first taken at the 2008 SHOT show in Las Vegas. Deliveries finally started on 6/17/2011. Serbu Super-Shorty Serbu Firearms is also noted for its production of the Super-Shorty, a compact 12- or 20-gauge (on special order) shotgun with front and rear pistol grips which in the United States is regulated as what is called Any Other Weapon under the National Firearms Act. They have also appeared in several movies and video games. Serbu has produced a variety of small-quantity firearms in the past, including a .22LR pen gun called the \\"Butt-master\\" and an integrally- suppressed Ruger MK II pistol called the \\"SIRIS\\". Serbu has also produced a .22LR muzzle suppressor called the \\"C-CAN\\" and an integrally suppressed Ruger 10/22 rifle called the \\"SIRIS 1022\\". Controversy In 2013, Serbu refused to sell their model BFG-50A semi-automatic .50 rifles to the New York City Police Department after the passage of the NY SAFE Act that classified their weapon as an assault weapon. Instances like this, in which a firearms manufacturer refuses to supply state entities with weapons that are forbidden to their private citizens, have become more common. Following their refusal to sell the rifles, Serbu then had T-shirts printed with an image of the classic Seinfeld character The Soup Nazi, played by actor Larry Thomas, and the words \\"No Serbu For You\\". Thomas, a gun control advocate, contacted Facebook and the T-shirt printers to have the shirts removed. Serbu has since removed the image of Thomas and replaced it with one of their founder Mark Serbu.

Rau grew up in a suburb of Stuttgart, where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations. After military service in World War I, he participated in the German Revolution of 1918-19. From 1920 onward, he was a leading agricultural policy maker of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). This ended in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power. Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years. As an enemy of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned, in total, for more than half of the time of Hitler's rule. After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union (USSR). From there, in 1937, he went on to Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades. In 1939, he was arrested in France, and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942. After a few months in a Gestapo prison, he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943. While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities, which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe. After the war he played an important role in the political scene of East Germany. Before the establishment of an East German state he was the chairman of the German Economic Commission, the precursor to the East German government. Subsequently, he became chairman of the National Planning Commission of East Germany and a deputy chairman of the East German Council of Ministers. He was a leading economic politician and diplomat of East Germany and led various ministries at different times. Within East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) he was a member of the party's CC Politburo. Origins and early political career =Stuttgart= Early years until World War I Rau was born in Feuerbach, now a part of Stuttgart, in the German Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the son of a peasant who later became a factory worker. He grew up in the adjacent city of Zuffenhausen, now also a part of Stuttgart. After finishing school in spring 1913, he started work as a press operator in a shoe factory. In November 1913 he changed his employer and moved to the Bosch factory works in Feuerbach. There he completed his training as metal presser and remained until autumn 1920, with interruptions due to war service during 1917-1918 and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918-1919. From 1913 Rau also was active in the labour movement. In that year he joined the metal workers' union (Deutscher Metallarbeiterverband) and a social democratic youth group in Zuffenhausen. During the following years, which saw the beginning of World War I, Rau's youth group, whose leader he became in 1916, was significantly influenced by the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The leftists considered the war a conflict between \\"imperialist powers\\". A few local members of a far left SPD group, among them Edwin Hoernle and Albert Schreiner, who later became well-known members of the Spartacus League (Spartakusbund), visited the youth group in Zuffenhausen and gave lectures. In 1916, Rau joined the Spartacists as well and became a co- founder of their youth organisation. In accordance with the politics of the Spartacists, in 1917 he joined the left-wing Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and in 1919 the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which had been founded mainly by members of the Spartacus League. In spring 1917, Rau, by this time an elected trade union official in his firm, participated in the attempt to organise a strike against the war. His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen- garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company.For documents on Infantry Regiment 126' see * In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8 November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart. Revolution New Castle about 1916. The upper parts of the then adjacent Wilhelm Palais can be seen behind the right wing of the castle. The revolution in November 1918 led in W√ºrttemberg, like everywhere in Germany, to the end of the monarchy. King William II left Stuttgart on 9 November, shortly after a revolutionary crowd had stormed his residence, the Wilhelm Palais and flown a red flag above the building. On the very same day the demonstrators were also able to seize some of Stuttgart's barracks, where parts of the garrisons openly joined them. Rau took active part in the events in Stuttgart's streets on this and the following day. These happenings were a first cumulation of a civil commotion, that had started a few days earlier with large strikes and demonstrations. On 4 November 1918, a first workers' council under the leadership of the 23-year-old Spartacist Fritz R√ºck had been established in Stuttgart.For Fritz R√ºck and the workers' councils in W√ºrttemberg, see * For Albert Schreiner and the soldiers' councils in W√ºrttemberg, see * During the following days and weeks more spontaneously elected worker and soldier councils were formed, and took over a large part of W√ºrttemberg. Rau was elected leader of the military police in his home city of Zuffenhausen, a part of Stuttgart's urban area. As early as 9 November, about 150 councillors gathered for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted the leaders of the SPD and USPD political parties, who had been invited to the meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in W√ºrttemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, which for the time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in W√ºrttemberg. During the ensuing months the communists tried repeatedly to seize power in Stuttgart and other cities in W√ºrttemberg through armed rebellion, accompanied by large-scale strikes. They seized public buildings and print offices. During one such an attempt - at the beginning of April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - a general strike took place in the Stuttgart area. The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of emergency and 16 people died in street fights. At the time of these events, Rau used his position as chief of the military police in Zuffenhausen to shut down companies that remained operational while the strike was ongoing. However, when the strike collapsed, Rau was removed from office by the government. Rau resumed his employment at Bosch in Feuerbach. During another general strike in several W√ºrttemberg cities, from 28 August to 4 September 1920, he led the strike committee in his firm, which resulted in his dismissal. Influences From 1919 until 1920 Rau was head of the local KPD group in Zuffenhausen, and chaired the KPD organisation in Stuttgart. The party leader in W√ºrttemberg at this time was Edwin Hoernle. Hoernle had visited Rau's youth group in Zuffenhausen and had become a long-standing friend; he was an influential teacher for Rau and made his voluminous library available to Rau to use.For Edwin Hoernle (short biographies), see * * For Hoernle as member of the ECCI in 1922, see: * / Extraction: The most outstanding ideological authority of the movement in Stuttgart, during the time of Rau's political involvement there, was however Clara Zetkin. She was a founding member of the Second International, about whom Friedrich Engels once had written, that he liked her very much, while emperor Wilhelm II is said to have referred to her as the \\"worst witch in Germany\\".For Engels' letter to Karl Marx' daughter Laura Lafargue, where he writes about Clara Zetkin, see * / Extraction: Speech manuscript of a lecture by the Stuttgart local historian Dr. Hans-Georg M√ºller in Stuttgart-Sillenbuch on 16 November 1995. She had been living in a Stuttgart suburb since 1891 and, since then, been gathering a circle of W√ºrttemberg Marxists around her, among them Rau's friend Hoernle, who had been editing with her the magazine Die Gleichheit. Her house, built in 1903 in Sillenbuch (now a part of Stuttgart), had become a meeting place of leading national and local left-wing and communist activists. It was also visited by international communist leaders like Vladimir Lenin, who stayed there overnight in 1907. In 1920, when Zetkin was elected to the Reichstag in Berlin, Hoernle and Rau moved to Berlin as well. =Berlin= In November 1920 Rau became a full-time party functionary and the secretary of the agricultural division of the Central Committee of the KPD in Berlin. Between 1921 and 1930 he lectured at the Land and Federal schools of the KPD, and edited a few left-wing agricultural journals. The head of the Central Committee's Division for Agriculture initially was Edwin Hoernle, with whom Rau had come from Stuttgart. Hoernle had been elected to the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI) in November 1922 and Rau succeeded him as division chief the following year. Afterwards, Rau also became a leading member of various national and international left wing farmer and peasant organisations. From 1923 onward, he was a member of the Secretariat of the International Committee of the Agricultural and Forest Workers and beginning in 1924 of the executive committee of the Reich Peasant Federation (Reichsbauernbund). In 1930 this was followed with a membership on the International Peasants' Council in Moscow and in 1931 he became an office member of the European Peasant Committee. From 1928 to 1933 he was also member of the Preu√üischer Landtag, the Prussian federal state parliament. There he joined the committee on agricultural affairs of the parliament and became its chairman. Imprisonment, International Brigades, World War II After Hitler's rise to power in January 1933 and the subsequent suppression of the KPD, Rau became a Central Committee's party instructor for southwest Germany and was active in building an underground party organisation there. On 23 May 1933 Rau was arrested and on 11 December 1934 convicted, together with Bernhard B√§stlein, for \\"preparations to commit high treason\\" by the People's Court of Germany. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment. After his release from custody, he emigrated to the USSR in August 1935, via Czechoslovakia, and became a deputy chairman of the International Agrarian Institute in Moscow. Heinrich Rau on a stamp commemorating the Spanish Civil War After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and following the formation of the International Brigades, Rau attended a school for military commanders in Ryazan (USSR), and subsequently went to Spain. After his arrival in April 1937, he joined the XI International Brigade and participated in the civil war as political commissar, beginning in May 1937, then as chief of staff and finally commander of the brigade, until March 1938, when he was injured. Although the brigade achieved some temporary successes during these months, Francisco Franco's troops were already on the road to victory. Rau's brigade saw combat in the battles of Brunete, Belchite, Teruel and the Aragon Offensive, where Rau was wounded. / Extraction: When Rau took charge of the XI Brigade, he might have been at odds with his predecessor, Richard Staimer, the future son-in-law of KPD leader Wilhelm Pieck. This was the time of the Great Purge which had its echos in Spain, and it could be perilous to have powerful enemies. Andr√© Marty, the chief commissar of the International Brigades based at Albacete, was also an executor of the Great Purge in Spain. Following Rau's injury, Marty managed to imprison him under a pretext for a brief time. A report, written in Moscow in 1940, described Rau as a \\"political criminal\\", who had had contact with the Spanish anarchists and members of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), which was demonized as \\"Trotskyist\\". These were serious allegations in this time, when accusations of Trotskyism frequently led to a death sentence if the accused was within reach of the authorities. It seems, however, that Rau also had influential friends. He was released from prison and expelled from Spain. He moved to France in May 1938. There, he was in charge of the emergency committee of the German and Austrian Spain fighters and member of the KPD country leadership in Paris until 1939. At the beginning of 1939 Rau crossed the border to Spain again and subsequently led, together with Ludwig Renn, the remainders of the XI Brigade. Together with other remaining international units ‚Äì now combined in the \\"Agrupaci√≥n Internacional\\" ‚Äì they fought on Spain's northern border after the fall of Barcelona, protecting the stream of refugees escaping to France. Thus the Agrupaci√≥n enabled the escape of perhaps some 470,000 civilians and soldiers. Rau was arrested by the French authorities in September 1939 and sent to Camp Vernet, an internment centre in France, and in November 1941 to a secret prison in Castres. In June 1942, he was handed over to the Gestapo by the Vichy regime and was held until March 1943 in the Gestapo prison in the Prince Albrecht Street. Afterwards he was sent to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp, where he remained until May 1945, when he participated in a camp rebellion as one of the organisers of a secret military camp organisation. \\\\- On page 269 a by Rau drawn plan for a camp uprising is described. East Germany =1945‚Äì1949= New start in Brandenburg When the war was over, Rau went to Vienna for some weeks and helped the KPD representatives in the city gather liberated political prisoners from Germany. He left Vienna in July 1945, when he led a car convoy with 120 former Mauthausen inmates to the Soviet occupied part of Berlin. Stamp advertising the 1945 land reform In September 1945, the Soviets appointed Rau a member of the provisional chairmanship of the Province of Brandenburg with the title of a vice-president and responsibility for food, agriculture and forests. Rau succeeded Edwin Hoernle, who had held this position since the end of June and became chairman of the central administration for agriculture and forests in the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ). In his new position, Rau was a member of the commission for the execution of the land reform in the province. In spring 1946 he assumed responsibility for economy and transport in Brandenburg. In this capacity, he was, from June 1946 onwards, chairman of the newly established sequester commission in the province. 1946 was also the year of the forced merger of eastern KPD and eastern SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), resulting in Rau's membership in the SED. Important 1946 events in Brandenburg were in November elections, which preceded an official status change from a province to a federal state in the following year. Afterwards, from 1946 until 1948, Rau was state parliament delegate and Minister for Economic Planning of Brandenburg. German Economic Commission Heinrich Rau (right) with Bruno Leuschner, one of his deputies at the DWK, 1951 In March 1948 Rau became chairman of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed during a time of very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948. On 20 June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the currency reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin. Under Rau's leadership the DWK, still under supervision of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German: Sowjetische Milit√§radministration in Deutschland or SMAD), quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions. This policy was also endorsed by the Soviet chief diplomat in Germany, Vladimir Semyonov, the future Chief Commissar of the USSR in Germany, who already in January 1948 correspondingly stated, that SMAD orders, (which accompanied DWK orders,) should have merely the purpose to back the authority of the German orders. One of Rau's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was, to come to agreements, which also obliged the Soviet side, including subordinate Soviet authorities, who still engaged in wild confiscations for reparation purposes. An important success in this direction was a half-year plan for the economic development in the second half of 1948, which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948. It was followed by a likewise accepted two- year plan for 1949 and 1950. The biggest obstacle to the plan's implementation soon proved to be the Berlin Blockade by the USSR, which was followed by a western counter-blockade of the Soviet occupation zone. As there were long- established economic ties between the western zone and the eastern, which was highly dependent on supplies from the West, the blockade was more damaging to the East. The West Berlin SPD newspaper Sozialdemokrat reported in April 1949, how Rau clearly criticized the blockade in a meeting of SED apparatchiks and there is reason to believe that he did the same in the meetings with the SMAD. According to the paper, Rau spoke of a \\"bad speculation\\" regarding the undervaluation of the dependence on western supplies, stating that the \\"broadminded Soviet help\\" turned out as insufficient and hinting that the blockade would soon be lifted. Finally the Berlin Blockade was lifted on 12 May 1949. The DWK's increasingly centralised administration resulted in a substantial increase in its staffing level, which grew from about 5000 employees in mid-1948 to 10,000 by the beginning of 1949. In March 1949, Rau, like the representative of a state, signed a first treaty with a foreign state, a trade agreement with Poland. =1949‚Äì1953= Establishment and difficult first years of a new state The time of Rau's German Economic Commission ended in October 1949 with the establishment of the East German state, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The GDR was proclaimed on 7 October 1949, at a ceremony in the former Air Ministry Building in Berlin, until then the seat of Rau's organisation. Five days later, the DWK was formally abolished on 12 October 1949. Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People's Chamber, the newly established parliament of the GDR and joined the new government. Grotewohl, 1951 Likewise in 1949, the ruling SED implemented traditional leadership structures of communist parties and Rau became a member of the newly established Central Committee of the SED and candidate member of its Politburo; in 1950 he became a full member of the Politburo as well as deputy chairman of the East German Council of Ministers. Between 1949 and 1950, Rau was Minister for Planning of the GDR and in 1950‚Äì1952 chairman of the National Planning Commission. In this position, as the key figure of the economic development, Rau came into conflict with SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht. In the face of an imminent economic collapse, Rau blamed the \\"Bureau Ulbricht\\" for the wrong policy. In response East Germany's old president Wilhelm Pieck renewed the old accusation of Trotskyism against Rau. In a later letter to Pieck of 28 November 1951, Rau protested at the manner in which the Secretariat usurped the Politburo by censoring his speech on economic affairs. In 1952‚Äì1953, Rau led the newly established Coordination Centre for Industry and Traffic at the East German Council of Ministers. The purpose of this office was effective control of the economy in order to overcome the difficulties, which were caused by a grown bureaucracy and unclear decision paths. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl described this in a talk with Joseph Stalin. After the death of Stalin in March 1953, the new collective Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17 June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8 July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General G√≥mez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed as a sign of weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions. =1953‚Äì1961= Competition in the Politburo and economic reform Khrushchev and Ulbricht at the SED's 5th Party Congress, 1958 Unlike some other rebels in the leadership, Rau kept most of his positions. He remained a member of the Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR. However, his position had been weakened. Bruno Leuschner, a follower of Ulbricht and Rau's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission, now became a new candidate member of the Politburo. During the ensuing period, Leuschner, often supported by Ulbricht, gradually superseded Rau as the senior leader for the economy as a whole. The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a success story. Concentrating on his tasks in the SED leadership and as a minister, Rau ‚Äì despite occasional internal criticism ‚Äì avoided giving the impression of any disagreement with Ulbricht, at least in public. In 1954, Rau received in the Order of Merit for the Fatherland (Vaterl√§ndischer Verdienstorden) in gold. Later, Ulbricht stated in a 1964 interview about the \\"introduction of socialism\\" in the GDR, that only three people were heavily involved in the economic development during that time, \\"namely Heinrich Rau, Bruno Leuschner and me. Others were not consulted!\\" In 1953‚Äì1955 Rau led the new established Ministry for Machine Construction, which combined the responsibilities of three existing ministries. His deputy in this ministry was Erich Apel, who would, in the early 1960s, become an initiator and architect of an economic reform, which became known as the New Economic System (NES). (Contemporary description of the New Economic System, published in 1966. The author received for this book also the 1966's Cornelius Ryan Award.) This later reform was presaged by a reform in the middle of the 1950s; the economic historian J√∂rg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES. Foreign trade and foreign policy Heinrich Rau (right) with Che Guevara, 1960 in East Berlin Between 1955‚Äì1961 Rau served as Minister for Foreign Trade and Inter-German Trade. The term \\"Inter-German Trade\\" meant the trade with West Germany. In this time both German states still saw German reunification as their own aim, but both envisaging different political systems. The West German position was that they, as the only freely elected government, had an exclusive mandate for the entire German people. In consequence of this, the GDR's official diplomatic relationships with other states were narrowed to the states of the Eastern Bloc. Practically no other states recognized the GDR. As a result, Rau's ministry established numerous new \\"trade missions\\" in other states, which served as a kind of surrogate for nonexistent embassies. It was a corollary, that Rau, in addition to his responsibility for the export-oriented industry, also chaired the Foreign Policy Commission of the SED Politburo (Au√üenpolitische Kommission beim Politb√ºro or APK) since 1955, in this period the actual decision-making body for foreign affairs, and visited other states in different parts of the world in this capacity. Among the visited states were, beside the core states of the Soviet Bloc, also then Eastern Bloc peripheral states, like China and Albania and leading states of the crystallizing Non-Aligned Movement like India and Yugoslavia (after the Bandung Conference). Between 1955 and 1957 he visited, as part of a diplomatic advertisement campaign in the Arab world, various Arabic states, among them repeatedly Egypt. One of his last deals, which he closed as minister, was a trade agreement with Cuba, signed by Cuba's minister Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, on 17 December 1960 in East Berlin. Rau, in poor health during his final years, died of a heart attack in East Berlin, in March 1961. Aftermath and legacy After his death, firms, schools, recreation homes, numerous streets, and a fighter squadron were named after him. The GDR issued a stamp with his picture three times. Rau was married twice and had three sons and a daughter. Like the other members of the Politburo, he lived until 1960 in a secured area of East Berlin's district Pankow and moved in 1960 to the Waldsiedlung near Wandlitz. In Pankow he had lived in Majakowskiring no. 50. In 1963, Rau's widow Elisabeth moved to this street again. ; on page 4, a photograph with Rau, Grotewohl and Pieck, visiting Franz Dahlem in his house in Majakowskiring, can be seen. When the prominent West German SPD politician and future President of Germany Johannes Rau visited an SPD rally in the East German city of Erfurt during the time of German reunification, he was introduced as \\"Prime Minister 'Heinrich Rau.

It peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Country Albums chart. Recording and composition After several saccharine duet albums with then-wife Tammy Wynette, Jones's third solo album on Epic was a return to his roots insomuch as Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced production would allow. More of the songs were up-tempo, a change of pace from his first two albums for the label. The title track, for example, is a novelty recorded at a blistering speed and contains tongue twisting lyrics about a country boy for whom nothing ever went right (the song would reach number 7 on the charts). The album also features \\"Mom And Dad's Waltz\\", a song originally written and performed by one of Jones's biggest musical influences Lefty Frizzell. The album's hit single was \\"What My Woman Can't Do\\", which rose to number 6. Jones helped Sherrill and Earl Montgomery write the song and also collaborated with Wynette on the prophetic \\"Wine (You've Used Me Long Enough)\\". Reception Thom Jurek of AllMusic praises the album as \\"a dynamite set that offered a solid look at what Jones and Sherrill were capable of - and delivered - in the coming years\\" and calls Jones's interpretation of Don Gibson's \\"Made For The Blues\\" and Frizzell's \\"Mom and Dad's Waltz\\" \\"solid, tender honky tonk ballads that offer the deep, raw emotion in the singer's best material.\\"  Track listing  References External links * George Jones' Official Website * Record Label Category:1973 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Albums produced by Billy Sherrill Category:Epic Records albums ","title":"Nothing Ever Hurt Me (Half as Bad as Losing You)"},{"id":"9915804","text":"El Calavera is a 1954 Argentinean film.

His work includes photography, sculpture, film, painting and installation art. Life and career After graduating from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs in Paris, Xavier Veilhan continues his formation in Berlin at the Hochschule der K√ºnste, in the atelier of artist Georg Baselitz. He returns to Paris to finish his studies in 1989 at the Institut des hautes Etudes en Arts plastiques. His work is multi-faceted, encompassing sculpture, installation, painting and photography, as well as hybrids of all of these. He is also engaged in performance work and filmmaking. He plays with the notions of the generic, of the industrially produced object and of universal representation, creating objects at once ambivalent and stark. Concerned with the scenography of a dedicated presentation, Veilhan addresses issues of perception as well as the physical and temporal relationships created within the context of the exhibition format. His work is to be found in the most important public and private collections worldwide. He has also made several permanent public works in numerous locations across the world, as well as creating temporary site-specific interventions within Architectones, a project that has received critical acclaim since 2012. Xavier Veilhan is represented by Andr√©hn-Schiptjenko (Stockholm, Paris), Perrotin (Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai), Galeria Nara Roesler (S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, New York) and 313 Art Project (Seoul, Paris). = 2017: Venice Biennale = He is chosen to represent France at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017.

This plover is resident in much of west Africa, mainly on inland rivers, pools and lakes. Its nest is a scrape lined with small pebbles in rocky uplands. After breeding in the wet season, this bird moves to open grasslands, including airfields and golf courses, in the dry season. It is sometimes seen at pools or reservoirs. The adult Forbes‚Äô plover is 20 cm in length. It has long wings and a long tail, and therefore looks different from most other small plovers in flight, the exception being the closely related three-banded plover which replaces it in eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar. The breeding adult has dark brown upperparts, and the underparts are white except for the two black breast bands, separated by a white band, which give this species its common and scientific names. The head is strikingly patterned, with a black crown, brown forehead, white supercilia extending from above the eyes to meet on the back of the neck, and a grey face. The eye ring and the base of the otherwise black bill are red. The sexes are similar. In non-breeding adults, the breast bands may be dark brown, and the supercilia buff-tinged. Juveniles resemble the non-breeding adult, but are duller. This species is larger and darker than the three-banded plover. The latter species also has a white forehead and a white wingbar. Forbes's plover is often seen as single individuals, but may form small flocks. It hunts by sight for insects, worms and other invertebrates. It has a piping peee-oo call. This species was named for the British zoologist William Alexander Forbes.

It is one of the largest snakes in the world but smaller than its close relative, the green anaconda. Like all boas and pythons, it is non-venomous and kills its prey by constriction. No subspecies are currently recognized. Etymology The Neo- Latin specific name notaeus derives from (ŒΩœâœÑŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ is a poetic form of ŒΩœâœÑŒπŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ/n≈çtiaios). In distinguishing his new species Eunectes notaeus from Eunectes murinus, Edward Drinker Cope stated, \\"Dorsal scales are larger and in fewer rows.\\" . Description Close-up of head, at the Reptilium Terrarium and Desert Zoo, Landau, Germany In the Ohrada Zoo, Hlubok√° nad Vltavou, Czech Republic Adults grow to an average of in total length. Females are generally larger than males, and have been reported up to in length. They commonly weigh , but specimens weighing more than have been observed. The color pattern consists of a yellow, golden-tan or greenish-yellow ground color overlaid with a series of black or dark brown saddles, blotches, spots and streaks. Distribution and habitat The range of the yellow anaconda encompasses the drainage of the Paraguay River and its tributaries, from the Pantanal region in Bolivia, Paraguay, and western Brazil to northeastern Argentina and northern Uruguay. It prefers mostly aquatic habitats, including swamps, marshes, and brush-covered banks of slow-moving rivers and streams. The species appears to have been introduced in Florida, although it is unknown whether the small population (thought to derive from escaped pets) is reproductive. Ecology The yellow anaconda forages predominately in shallow water in wetland habitats. Most predation occurs from June to November, when flooding has somewhat subsided and wading birds are the most common prey. Observations and analysis of gut and waste contents from regularly flooded areas in the Pantanal region of southwestern Brazil indicate that they are generalist feeders that employ both ambush predation and wide-foraging strategies. Their prey consists nearly exclusively of aquatic or semi-aquatic species, including a wide variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and eggs. Larger specimens can prey upon larger animals, such as brocket deer, capybaras or peccaries. The prey-to-predator weight ratio is often much higher than for other types of Boidae. Cannibalism has been observed in this species, though it is not clear how often this occurs. The yellow anaconda has few predators. Juveniles and the occasional adult may be taken by caimans, larger anacondas, jaguars, some canids such as the crab-eating fox, mustelids, and raptors. The species is also hunted by humans for its skin. Breeding Female Yellow Anacondas release a pheromone which entices the males to breed. In the wild, multiple male Anacondas are known to attempt to breed with a single female at the same time. This activity is known as a breeding ball and it is most commonly associated with Garter Snakes. Interactions with humans A yellow anaconda in the waterhole, at the Beardsley Zoo, Bridgeport, Connecticut In captivity the species has a reputation for being unpredictable and somewhat dangerous to humans. In the United States, the import, transportation and sale of the species across state lines were banned in 2012 to try to prevent the yellow anaconda from becoming an invasive species in areas such as the Florida Everglades. The conservation status of the yellow anaconda has not been assessed by the IUCN.

The setting is an institution for the blind, and the featured protagonist is a man who rails against his misfortune, his energy and thinking distorted by a need to fight his blindness.

She succeeded her father in January or February 1214. She was consecrated in 1214 by Riccus, Archbishop of Cagliari, in the presence of the higher clergy and the grandees. She swore an oath not to diminish the territory of the giudicato, nor to alienate its castles, nor to make foreign alliances without their consent. Then, on 14 June, she married Barisone III of Arborea, son of Peter I, who was imprisoned by her father. He took the dynastic name \\"Torchitorio V\\" and they ruled their two giudicati jointly, each being cited in the acts of the other in their own giudicato.Solmi, 147n. Then, Benedetta made homage to the Holy See. With Archbishop Riccus, the bishop of Sulcis, and her husband, she made many donations to the churches of S. Giorgio di Suelle and the church of Sulcis. Benedetta favoured natives over Pisans for positions in her government and preferred to cultivate the economy of Sardinia than that of the Republic of Pisa. In 1215, the wrath of Pisa fell on her. In that year, Lambert Visconti, then judge of Gallura, landed a large army near Cagliari and took the dominating hilltop of S. Gilla, fortifying it. Benedetta was subsequently forced to flee her capital for the interior. In June 1216, she made a donation to the cathedral of Pisa in hopes of procuring their support, but in 1217, Lambert's brother, Ubald I Visconti, forced her to accept terms surrendering Cagliari. She received the giudicato back as fief from the consul of Pisa. However, violence between Sardinians and Pisans escalated in Cagliari and Benedetta and Barisone made an alliance with Comita III of Torres and the Republic of Genoa in hopes of expelling the Pisans. In her opposition to Pisa, however, Benedetta found support in Pope Honorius III. In February 1217, he annulled the election of the Pisan Marianus, then bishop of Suelli, to the archdiocese of Cagliari. In his place he sent Ugolino dei Conti, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Apostolic Legate to Corsica and Sardinia. He also urged Milan to aid Marianus II of Torres. In that spring, Barisone died and in 1218 Ubald arranged for his widow to contract a new marriage with the widowered Lambert, her one-time conqueror, in hopes of bringing peace to Cagliari. On 9 April 1220, the two were married, but the pope immediately pronounced his annulment. In December 1224, Benedetta renewed the oath of homage to the Holy See to Goffredo, the papal legate. She agreed to pay an annual tribute of twenty pounds of silver to the Holy See and not to contract any other marriage without papal approval and blessing. If she were to die without heirs, the pope would inherit Cagliari. The following years were ones of peace. In 1225-1226, Benedetta included her son William in several donations to various churches. But in the latter year, war began anew with Lambert's heir, Ubaldo II. In the following years, in order to protect herself from Ubaldo, she married twice more, both times without papal permission. Her third husband (1227) was Enrico di Ceola, a Pisan of the Capraia family who soon gained papal favour. Her fourth husband was Rinaldo de Glandis and their marriage was declared valid. Nevertheless, violence in Cagliari forced her to move to the castle of Santa Igia and then to Massa, her ancestral home. There she died, late 1232 or early 1233. By February 1233, Pope Gregory IX had given Massa and Potenzolo to Ugo di Procaria, while Cagliari was divided between the Visconti, Capraia, and Donoratico, Pisan families. Her heir was William. He reigned, but never ruled. Her sister Agnes and her husband, the aforementioned Marianus of Torres, held the regency.

It is, along with the Iowa Army National Guard, an element of the Iowa National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the Iowa Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Iowa through the office of the Iowa Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Iowa Air National Guard is headquartered at Camp Dodge, Johnston, and its commander is Brigadier General Shawn Ford. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Iowa Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Iowa ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Iowa Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Iowa ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Iowa Air National Guard consists of the following major units: * 132nd Wing : Established 25 February 1941 (as: 124th Observation Squadron); operates: MQ-9 Reaper : Stationed at: Des Moines Air National Guard Base : Gained by: Air Combat Command : The 132d Wing's operational mission is to deploy worldwide and execute directed tactical fighter sorties to destroy enemy forces, supplies, equipment, communications systems and installations with conventional weapons.132d Fighter Wing website * 185th Air Refueling Wing : Established 23 August 1946 (as: 174th Fighter Squadron); operates: KC-135R Stratotanker : Stationed at: Sioux City Air National Guard Base, Sergeant Bluff : Gained by: Air Mobility Command : The mission of the 185 ARW is to provide mid-air refueling and mobility sustainment in direct support of the global mission of the Air Force.185th Air Refueling Wing website Support Unit Functions and Capabilities: * 133d Test Squadron : Stationed at Fort Dodge, the 133d provides an effective and sustainable war fighting Command and Control (C2) capability through the professional test and evaluation of the Control and Reporting Center to include the development of future system upgrades and modernization. History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 A Republic F-84E Thunderjet of the 124th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Des Moines Municipal Airport, 1956 The Iowa Air National Guard origins date to the formation of the 132d Fighter Group at Des Moines Municipal Airport, Des Moines, receiving federal recognition on 23 August 1946. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. In addition, the 174th Fighter Squadron was formed at Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, receiving federal recognition on 23 August 1946. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Iowa Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 1 October 1962 the 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron was expanded to a Group level, and the 185th Tactical Fighter Group received federal recognition and was activated. Today, the 132d Fighter Wing deploys worldwide and executes directed tactical fighter sorties to destroy enemy forces, supplies, equipment, communications systems and installations with conventional weapons. The 185th Air Refueling Wing provides mid-air refueling and mobility sustainment in direct support of the global mission of the Air Force. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Iowa has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Iowa ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed.

This is stronger than a perfect group, which is one whose first homology group vanishes. In more classical terms, a superperfect group is one whose abelianization and Schur multiplier both vanish; abelianization equals the first homology, while the Schur multiplier equals the second homology.  Definition  The first homology group of a group is the abelianization of the group itself, since the homology of a group G is the homology of any Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space of type K(G, 1); the fundamental group of a K(G, 1) is G, and the first homology of K(G, 1) is then abelianization of its fundamental group. Thus, if a group is superperfect, then it is perfect. A finite perfect group is superperfect if and only if it is its own universal central extension (UCE), as the second homology group of a perfect group parametrizes central extensions.  Examples  For example, if G is the fundamental group of a homology sphere, then G is superperfect. The smallest finite, non-trivial superperfect group is the binary icosahedral group (the fundamental group of the Poincar√© homology sphere). The alternating group A5 is perfect but not superperfect: it has a non-trivial central extension, the binary icosahedral group (which is in fact its UCE) is superperfect. More generally, the projective special linear groups PSL(n, q) are simple (hence perfect) except for PSL(2, 2) and PSL(2, 3), but not superperfect, with the special linear groups SL(n,q) as central extensions. This family includes the binary icosahedral group (thought of as SL(2, 5)) as UCE of A5 (thought of as PSL(2, 5)). Every acyclic group is superperfect, but the converse is not true: the binary icosahedral group is superperfect, but not acyclic. References * A. Jon Berrick and Jonathan A.

He was part of the Tyrone Under-21 team won the Ulster Championship in 2006. Senior inter-county career His Tyrone Senior career was shrouded in controversy from the beginning. He made his debut for Tyrone in the 2007 Dr McKenna Cup; however, he had also been selected by his university team for the competition. The competition rules state that in such an event, the university should get first choice of the player, in order to even up the competition. Tyrone manager Mickey Harte refused to obey this rule, contending that it should be up to the players to decide whom they wish to play for. Four Tyrone players were caught up in the dispute: Cavanagh, Brendan Boggs, Damien McCaul (who all play for the University of Ulster) and St. Mary's University, Belfast player Cathal McCarron. Tyrone were docked points for the match the players participated in, but still progressed to go on to win the competition. He has continued unabated, however, and was consistently on the starting line-up for Tyrone in their 2007 National League campaign. In his Ulster Championship debut, on 20 May 2007, against Fermanagh, Cavanagh was having a solid game until an accidental collision left him badly injured. The game was delayed for over seven minutes while he was receiving treatment, and was taken to hospital as a precaution. Initial fears about a serious neck injury were allayed as he was discharged from hospital soon after the end of the match. The injury ruled him out of Tyrone's next fixture against Donegal.

It was built in 1837 and enlarged in the early 1850s, and stands as an excellent example of the Monterey Colonial style of architecture popularized throughout California in the 1830s and 1840s. It is the only remaining example of this style in the Santa Clara Valley and San Francisco Bay Area. The adobe is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is the result of a major remodeling completed by 1853 by the Alviso family. They added a wood-frame second floor to the family's one-story adobe house. Before the remodeling in 1853, the earlier building, built around 1837, most likely as a one-story adobe, provided the thick adobe walls of the first floor. The Alviso Adobe is a two-story residence with a hipped roof and a balcony carried on three sides. The plan of the rectangular residence is symmetrical, comprising three rooms downstairs with three upstairs rooms. The Alviso Adobe contains a remarkable amount of historic fabric‚Äîadobe walls from the 1830s, examples of framing and doors, windows, hardware from 1853 and an almost intact 1920s kitchen. It is unusual to find a building as little altered over a period of 150 years. The Alviso Adobe exhibits the character- defining features of the Monterey style: wood-shingled hipped roof, wood balconies on three sides, paired French doors opening to the outside, multi- paned windows, interior fireplaces, and a symmetrical layout. The property is under renovation. The project work comprises the upgrading of the existing historic farm to reflect the theme of a working ranch and orchard as it would have appeared in the 1920s. A number of mature trees are present on the site. A barn containing timbers dating to the 1840s was recently demolished. Both historic and prehistoric subsurface cultural remains have been documented in the vicinity of the residence.

She was recognised as the world's fastest female bowler throughout her career and became the first woman to take 100 One Day International wickets. In 2019, Fitzpatrick was inducted into both the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame and the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.https://www.icc- cricket.com/news/1281266 Career summary While juggling her full-time job as a waste collector and later a postwoman, Fitzpatrick represented Australia in cricket on 124 occasions. She made her international debut in 1991 and went on to play 13 Test matches, taking 60 wickets (the second-most by an Australian woman, only behind Betty Wilson) at an average of 19.11. Fitzpatrick also played 109 One Day Internationals, taking 180 wickets (the most by any woman until surpassed by Jhulan Goswami in May 2017) at an average of 16.79. She was a member of the Australian team that won the Women's Cricket World Cup in 1997 and 2005. On 25 February 2006, Fitzpatrick became the oldest woman to take a five-wicket haul in ODI history, at the age of 37 years and 358 days. In March 2007, she announced her retirement from international cricket and also brought her domestic career with Victoria to an end after taking 148 wickets in 103 WNCL matches. From May 2012 to March 2015, Fitzpatrick served as head coach of the Australian women's team, overseeing three successful world championship campaigns. In 2019, Fitzpatrick was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.https://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/about/awards-and-events/australian- cricket-awards Later that year, she was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.  Bowling speed  Due to limitations of available technological resources in her playing tenure, Fitzpatrick's top and average speeds are estimates rather than precise figures. Thorough eye-witness testimony agrees she was the world's fastest female bowler during her prime years, while sporadic measurements indicated her quickest delivery was at least 125 km/h. This evaluation holds up both impressively and credibly compared to modern women's cricket which is characterised by its increased professional standards‚Äîas of 2019, the fastest current bowlers are South Africa's Shabnim Ismail and New Zealand's Lea Tahuhu, who have been officially recorded at speeds of 128 km/h and 126 km/h respectively.

His Chinese name was ÂÆâÂ§ö.  Early life  Born in Namur, Belgium in 1644, Thomas joined the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1660 and first taught in the schools of Armenti√®res, Huy and Tournai. Equipped with a thorough training in Mathematics and Astronomy he was sent, at his own request, as missionary to China (1677). After a long and difficult sea journey - passing through Goa, Siam (Thailand), and Malacca - he reached Macau in 1682 just in time to observe an eclipse of the Sun (1683).  At the Chinese imperial court  Thomas was called by the aging Father Ferdinand Verbiest, who had just found himself appointed 'Vice- President of the Tribunal of Mathematics', (a very important and influential post in the Qing Empire of China), to join him in Beijing. After the death of Verbiest in 1688, Thomas took his place as the main mathematician and astronomical expert of China. For twenty years he was then a close adviser to the Kangxi Emperor who, beyond scientific questions, consulted him also on moral and religious matters. In 1692, he obtained an 'edict of tolerance' that gave to the missionaries almost complete freedom to preach Christianity.  Chinese Rites controversy  At a time when the future of Christian faith seemed to be bright in China, the Chinese Rites controversy was raging in Europe. Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon, a papal legate, arrived in Beijing in 1705 purportedly to inquire on the orthodoxy of the Chinese rites (particularly the 'Veneration of Ancestors' ritual, accepted by the Jesuits). In fact Tournon's mind was made up. By completely disregarding Chinese customs and etiquette, he offended the Kangxi Emperor who had first received him well. No pleading of Antoine Thomas, then Superior of the Jesuits in China, could prevent Tournon from issuing a decree from Nanjing (1707) obliging the missionaries under severe penalties to abolish those rites. A last desperate attempt of Thomas, beseeching the legate to defer the implementation of the decree until further news was received from Rome, fell on deaf ears. Thomas died soon after in 1709 in Beijing, and was buried close to his friend and predecessor Ferdinand Verbiest in the Jesuit cemetery of Beijing.  Main work  Synopsis mathematica, Douai, 1685.
