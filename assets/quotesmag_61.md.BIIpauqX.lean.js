Enrico Tamberlik (16 March 1820 - 13 March 1889) was an Italian tenor who sang to great acclaim at Europe and America's leading opera venues. He excelled in the heroic roles of the Italian and French repertories and was renowned for his powerful declamation and clarion high notes. Career Born in Rome, some sources claim that Tamberlik might have been of Romanian descent and that his real name was Nikita Torna.https://operawire.com/artist-profile-enrico-tamberlick-a-major-tenor-of- the-19th-century/ Nonetheless, his vocal training was entirely Italian. He studied first in Naples with Zirilli and Borgna, then in Bologna with Guglielmi, and finally in Milan with De Abella. The budding tenore robusto made his debut in concert in 1837 and later graced the operatic stage for the first time at the Teatro Apollo in Rome, as Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia and as Arnoldo in Guglielmo Tell. He subsequently appeared at the Teatro Fondo in Naples in 1841, under the name Enrico Danieli, as Tybalt in I Capuleti e i Montecchi, and during the 1842-43 season, made his debut at the Teatro San Carlo, under the name Enrico Tamberlik (which he used henceforth). He appeared, too, in Madrid and Barcelona. In 1850, Tamberlik debuted at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, as Masaniello in La muette de Portici. He was to appear regularly at Covent Garden until 1870, enjoying star billing each time. Tamberlik sang often at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg from 1850 until 1863, creating the role of Alvaro in Verdi's La forza del destino on 10 November 1862. He made his initial guest appearance at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien in Paris in 1858, returning there many times until 1877. Tamberlik portrayed Alfredo in La traviata to the Violetta of Sofia Vera Lorini for the opening of the original Teatro Col√≥n opera house in Buenos Aires in 1857. He also appeared in North America, singing at the Academy of Music in New York City during the 1873-74 season. He last singing engagements in London were at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1877. He toured Spain again in 1881 and retired from the operatic stage shortly afterwards. Tamberlik's death occurred in Paris, three days before his 69th birthday. Vocal Characteristics and repertoire Photograph by Andr√©-Adolphe-Eug√®ne Disd√©ri Tamberlik succeeded Gaetano Fraschini (1816‚Äì1887) as Italy's leading tenore robusto, and he ranked behind only the more lyrical-voiced Giovanni Matteo Mario as the most celebrated Italian tenor of the middle decades of the 19th century. (Indeed, he and Mario actually sang together in a production of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable at Covent Garden.) According to contemporary accounts of his singing, Tamberlik possessed a big, incisive voice with a pervasive vibrato (for which he was criticised by some English music critics) and ringing top notes‚Äîincluding a potent top C-sharp delivered in full chest voice. These virile vocal attributes, coupled with an imposing appearance, made him an exceptionally exciting interpreter of dramatic roles, especially such parts as Jean in Le proph√®te, Arnoldo in Guglielmo Tell and Manrico in Il trovatore. Other notable roles of his included (Rossini's) Otello, Pollione, Arturo, Ernani, Robert le diable, Faust, Don Ottavio, Florestan, Max, Poliuto and Cellini. The heroic tenor Francesco Tamagno (1850‚Äì1905) was regarded as being Tamberlik's foremost successor. Their careers overlapped slightly and an echo of Tamberlik's voice and style may be preserved in the acoustic recordings that Tamagno made in Italy in 1903-1904 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company.

This species is the common bay and inshore puffer for the waters around Texas and Louisiana. It has also been found as far east as Apalachicola Bay and south to Yucat√°n. Mature least puffers are small, usually less than four inches (100 mm).Hoese, H.D.; Moore, R.H. (1977) Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Adjacent Waters. College Station: Texas A&M; University Press. pp. 269, 276  Description  Least puffers are tetraodontids, meaning their teeth have fused into beaks with a median division that produces two plates in the upper and lower jaw.Walls, J.G. (1975) Fishes of the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Neptune City: T.F.H. Publications Inc. pp. 408,411 Tetraodontids can also be characterized by their lack of fin spines or ribs, and a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales. They typically have dorsal fins containing 8-9 rays and their pectoral rays are usually within the number range of 13-16. Sphoeroides parvus have a caudal fin that can be dusky or plain and they lack pelvic fins entirely.Matsuura, K., Shao, K., Leis, J.L., Liu, M., Hardy, G. & Jing, L. 2014. Sphoeroides parvus. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2014: e.T193611A2247610. No predominant dark spot is found in axil of the pectoral fin, with the fin's meristics being 13-16 rays. The dorsal side of S. parvus is brownish gray, while a white coloration dominates the venter. There is a ventrolateral row of black blotches, being irregular in size and arrangenment, separating the dorsal and ventral colorations. The body has color irregularities of light and dark on the sides and back. A least puffer body is elongate and globular, with their sides often having a golden hue. The interorbital width is typically 25% or more of snout length.Shipp, R.L.,Yerger, R.W., 1969. A new puffer fish, Sphoeroides parvus, from the western Gulf of Mexico, with a key to species of Sphoeroides from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 82: 477-488. The least puffer is capable of inflating its abdomen with water when frightened or disturbed. It is the smallest known species of Sphoeroides and it most closely resembles S. nephelus and S. maculatus, both of which have overlapping distributions with S. parvus.  History & Distribution  Sphoeroides parvus distribution can range from Apalachicola Bay and westward throughout the Gulf of Mexico. It is considered the dominant species of puffer in the muddy waters of Mobile Bay and westward. Its dominance is replaced by S. nephelus in the clearer waters of northwestern Florida. S. parvus is most closely allied morphilogically to S. maculatus, which is found in the Atlantic from Canada to northeastern Florida. It is believed that prior to existence of the Florida peninsula, the progenitor species of S. parvus and S. maculatus was distributed along the southern coast of the United States. The emergence of this peninsula split the population in two, one species isolated in the Atlantic and the other in the Gulf. The least puffer has been recorded from very shallow waters to depths of up to 50 m.  Habitat & Assessment of Concern  S. parvus is generally considered abundant and common in coastal, bay, and estuarine waters, over sandy and mud bottoms. This preference makes the least puffer commonly taken as by-catch during inshore shrimp trawls.This species is not utilized or targeted for any reason and its range overlaps with several marine protected areas. For this reason, Sphoeroides parva is listed as Least Concern.

Unlike many other pufferfish species, the flesh of the northern puffer is not poisonous (its viscera can contain poison). They are commonly called sugar toads in the Chesapeake Bay region, where they are eaten as a delicacy. In much of the Northeast, the fish is known simply as \\"blowfish\\" or \\"chicken of the sea\\".On the Water: Chicken of the Sea Description The northern puffer is a club-shaped fish with a gray, brown or olive back and a yellow or white belly.Chesapeake Bay Program Adults have small spines covering the entire body with a tiny beak-like mouth. Its color is poorly defined black/dark green spots and saddles and a yellow to white belly. It has tiny jet-black pepper spots (about 1 mm in diameter) scattered over most of pigmented surface, particularly evident on cheeks. Lower sides of the body have a row of black, elongate, bar-like markings. A small dorsal fin is set far back near the tail. Sphoeroides maculatus, like others in the puffer family, \\"puffs up\\" into a ball in self-defense by inhaling water into a special chamber near its stomach. They will puff up with air, if taken out of the water. The northern puffer reaches up to in length, but is usually around . Habitat The northern puffer inhabits bays, estuaries and protected coastal waters at depths of in the northwest Atlantic. It ranges from Florida (USA) to Newfoundland (Canada). Diet The northern puffer feeds primarily on shellfish, and occasionally on finfish. Using its beak-like mouth it can extract shellfish from their shells and sometimes break the shells to obtain a meal. They will attack blue crabs, blowing water underneath to turn the crab over, then attack the underside before it can right itself. Life cycle Little is known about the life cycle of the northern puffer. They spawn from May through August in shallow, nearshore waters. The female lays adhesive eggs that attach to the sandy or muddy bottom, and the male guards the eggs until they hatch.

Background The fact that Luv' disbanded came as no surprise. The problems started in August 1980 when Patty Brard left the trio. She was replaced by Ria Thielsch who was officially introduced to the public with the release of \\"My Number One\\" which was a big selling single in Benelux. Soon after, the tensions within the group, the hectic schedule of the ladies and Marga Scheide's overwork provoked the end of Luv'.

The amplifiers were originally produced from early 1948 to 1966 and reissues are in current production. Its predecessor was the Fender Model 26 \\"Woodie\\" produced from 1946 to 1948.  Tweed Deluxe  The Fender Deluxe amp of the 1950s was a medium-powered unit designed to let guitarists \\"hold their own\\" in a small group. As blues, western swing, Western, and rockabilly bands began getting louder, the overdriven tone of a cranked-up Deluxe found its way onto many live and recorded performances. The earliest version of the Deluxe was the 5A3,http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-5A3-Schematic.pdf and is often referred to as having a TV Front appearance because the wide panels around the grill were like the television sets of the 1950s. This was true also of the smaller Fender Princeton student and studio amp introduced in 1946 and upgraded in 1948. Subsequent versions of the Deluxe were the \\"wide panel\\" cabinet design 5B3,http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-5B3-Schematic.pdf 5C3,http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-5C3-Schematic.pdf and 5D3, followed by the \\"narrow panel\\" cabinet 5E3. The Deluxe was the most popular of the Tweed amplifiers made by Fender.Cf. Weber, p.38 It is relatively small in size, having one twelve inch speaker. Depending on the model it has either three or four inputs (5E3http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-5E3-Schematic.pdf) and two channels. Each channel has a volume control. Both channels share a tone control. The inputs and controls are mounted at the top of the amplifier. It is often referred to as the \\"Tweed Deluxe\\" because of its covering‚Äîa light brown material which is actually a cotton twill that is often lacquered. At the time, Leo Fender produced amplifiers with the intention of having the amplifier stay clean even at high volumes. The Tweed Deluxe is not known for producing a clean tone at high volumes, and as such, was regarded as being an intermediate amplifier. The saturated tone this amplifier produces at higher volumes is the reason why it is one of the more famous amplifiers Fender ever produced. It is part of the signature tone for many musicians, a few notable examples being Larry Carlton, Don Felder, Billy Gibbons and Neil Young. Unusual for a Fender amplifier, the Deluxe (models 5D3http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-5D3-Schematic.pdf and 5E3) has a cathode biased output stage, with no negative feedback (a distinctive combination it shares with the Vox AC30 and the 18 watt Marshall model 1974). The output valves are driven by a cathodyne phase splitter. These aspects of the circuit make a key contribution to the complex, wild and ragged sound of an overdriven 5E3 Deluxe, especially in comparison to other Fender amplifiers. Most Fender push-pull amplifier designs use negative feedback, tapped from the output transformer speaker winding to enable more headroom before power stage distortion starts. They also use the more efficient negative-voltage fixed biasing on the output valves, allowing higher output power while running the output valves at a cooler temperature. (The earlier 5C3 Deluxe model did use negative feedback although it too was cathode biased.) The amplifier has a 5Y3-GT rectifier, 2 6V6-GT power tubes operating in push-pull mode, and a 12AY7 and a 12AX7 in the preamp.The Tube Store (2010, June 21). Tweed Deluxe (Early and 5C3 Models). Retrieved from http://www.thetubestore.com/Resources/Guitar-Amp-Info/Early-Fender-Tweed- Amps#tweed Deluxe (early and 5C3 models) The output is rated at about 15 watts.http://www.thetubestore.com/Resources/Guitar-Amp-Info/Early-Fender- Tweed-Amps#tweed Deluxe (5D3 and 5E3 models) The Tweed Deluxe originally came equipped with a Jensen P12R speaker. Due to limited power handling, owners sometimes replaced it with the more powerful Jensen P12Q. The Tweed Deluxe is such a seminal amplifier, is so desirable and (in its original form) so expensive, that there are at least 30 or 40 companies making clones or variants of it, either as kits or as completed amplifiers.  Brown Deluxe  Between 1959 and 1963, Fender began redressing several of their existing amp models in a light brown material known as tolex, and moving the control faces from the top-rear of the cabinet to the front. These amps are referred to as the Brown or Brownface Fender amps. The Deluxe was one such model that made this transition in 1961. The circuit was also changed to include a tremolo effect, separate tone controls for the input channels, and a long-tail pair- type phase inverter. The preamp tube complement was changed to a trio of 12AX7 tubes, and the rectifier was changed to the more efficient GZ34 tube. The pair of 6V6GT power tubes remained the same, although the bias structure was changed from cathode to fixed biasing, bringing the output power up to around 20 watts. The circuit number was changed to 6G3,http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Deluxe-6G3-Schematic.pdf and Fender continued to build and dress the Deluxe in these circuits and cosmetics until 1963.  Blackface Deluxe  Fender again made a change in their amplifier cosmetics between 1963 and 1964. The color of the tolex covering was changed to black, and the control knobs were changed from ones with pointers that indicated the level number labeled on the control face to ones that had the level numbers incorporated upon the knobs themselves. These are referred to as the Blackface amps. The Deluxe was given its new look in 1963, and again, the circuitry was altered to the number AA763, devoting a full 12AX7 to the preamp of each of the relabeled \\"Normal\\" and \\"Vibrato\\" channels, as well as to the oscillator for the tremolo effect, a 12AT7 tube as a phase inverter, and individual Treble and Bass control knobs rather than single tone controls for each channel. The output bias remained fixed, but incorporated a potentiometer to make bias adjustment simpler. The output was also bumped to 22 watts. When Fender redressed the Deluxe in 1963, they began producing a spin-off model that included an integrated spring reverb tank, thus giving birth to the Fender Deluxe Reverb. Fender discontinued the base Deluxe model in 1966 but as of 2018, the Deluxe Reverb version was still in production.  Reproduction  In 2007‚Äì2011, Fender's Custom Shop division made an authentic recreation of the 5E3 Deluxe. Handwired point-to-point and with custom made transformers based on the 1957 specification it was dubbed the Fender '57 Deluxe Amp. This is the first time Fender made a reproduction of the Tweed Deluxe. In 2012 Fender issued an Artist Signature amplifier based on the 5E3 circuit with the addition of a tremolo effect; the Fender Eric Clapton (or EC) Tremolux. In 2014 Fender introduced a piggyback head version of the 5E3 Deluxe to the Custom Shop lineup, dubbed the Fender '57 Deluxe Head. In 2016 Fender issued a hand-wired Artist Signature model, \\"Fender Edge Deluxe\\", based on a customized 1957 5E3 Tweed Deluxe, part of the rig of U2-guitarist \\"The Edge\\". It featured the addition of a Celestion Blue Alnico speaker, a tighter \\"bass\\" response from the preamp, a 12AX7 in V1 instead of a 12AY7, and, an added \\"Standby\\" switch. By mid 2016 the '57 Deluxe is once again included in the custom series as the Fender '57 Custom Deluxe.

It was raised in 1784 under the East India Company. The regiment later saw service on the North West Frontier and in World War I and World War II. In 1947, it was allocated to the new Indian Army, where it continues to exist as the 7th Light Cavalry Formation and early history The history of this regiment can be traced to 1784 when a force of cavalry was hired from the Nawab of Arcot by the East India Company. These regiments subsequently mutinied over pay issues. The regiments involved were disbanded and from their remnants, volunteers formed the 2nd Madras Cavalry. This new regiment would eventually become the 7th Light Cavalry. The title was first changed to that of 3rd Madras Native Cavalry. Under this designation the regiment first saw action during the Third Mysore War in 1790, against Tipu Sultan. The regiment was next in action during the Fourth Mysore War in 1799. It subsequently fought with distinction at the Battle of Seringapatam and at the Battle of Mahidpur in the Pindari War of 1817, after which it was renamed the 3rd Madras Light Cavalry. For these actions the regiment was awarded the battle honors Mysore, Seringapatam and Mahidipore. The regiment was subsequently involved in several minor operations against the southern Mahrattas from 1844 to 1855. A detachment of the 3rd Madras Light Cavalry was then sent to join the Deccan Horse during the Mutiny of 1857. During the remainder of the 19th century the regiment did not see any action. In 1891 the regiment was converted to lancers, becoming the 3rd Regiment of Madras Lancers. In the reorganisation of the Indian Army of 1903, their title was changed to the 28th Light Cavalry. During this time the class composition of the regiment was 33% Tamils from Madras Presidency, 33% sikhs and 34% Jats. Madras Cavalry World War I At the start of World War I, the regiment was stationed in Quetta as part of the 4th (Quetta) Division. In July 1915 two squadrons were sent to Persia where they were mounted on camels. In this role they were tasked with stopping German agents from traveling across Persia to Afghanistan. The remainder of the regiment was posted to Persia in November 1915.\\"We Lead\\". 7th Light Cavalry 1784-1990 The regiment's effectiveness in Persia was demonstrated when a detachment captured a German officer, Lieutenant Winkleman, who was attempting to reach the Amir of Afghanistan to convince him to rebel or start a Jihad, against the British in India. =Russia= Following the Russian Revolution the regiment was sent to Trans- Caspasia in May 1918 to assist the White Russian Menshevik forces to fight the Bolsheviks. In April 1919 the regiment returned to Meshed in Persia, where it stayed for seven months employed in escorting convoys. In November 1919 the regiment started back for India and reached Lucknow in February 1920. The regiment received the battle honors Merv and Persia 1915 for their services in the Great War. Between the Wars In 1921 the 28th Light Cavalry left Lucknow for Dera Ismail Khan on the North West Frontier. In 1922 another reorganization saw the regiment renamed as the 7th Light Cavalry and the class composition was altered. The current class composition of the regiment is two squadron Jats and one squadron sikh. From 1924 to 1929 it was stationed at Bolarum, followed by Sialkot, then Jullunder until October 1933. The regiment then moved to Loralai in Baluchistan. It stayed there until October 1935 before moving back to Bolarum where it was stationed at the start of the Second World War. The same year the ‚ÄòIndianization‚Äô of the Indian Army officer corps began in selected regiments. Initially in the cavalry the two units selected were the 7th Light Cavalry and the 16th Light Cavalry. Under this policy British officers would no longer be appointed to the regiment. Instead newly commissioned Indian officers, initially trained at Royal Military College, Sandhurst and from 1932 onwards at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, would be appointed instead. The first Indian officer was appointed in December 1923. By September 1939, 16 of the 22 officers of the regiment were Indian.Indian Army List October 1939 World War II At the start of the Second World War the regiment was stationed in Bolarum as part of the 4th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade. The 7th Light Cavalry were brigaded with the: *14th/20th Hussars *Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry *3rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery *4th Cavalry Brigade Signal Troop. The last mounted parade of the 7th Light Cavalry took place in 1940. However even by early 1941 the only mechanical transport provided for the now dismounted regiment was an Austin car for the commandant and a few motorbikes for dispatch riders.p63 \\"We Lead. 7th Light Cavalry 1784-1990\\" Vehicles trickled in and finally a full complement of 52 Stuart tanks was received by April 1943.p65 \\"We Lead. 7th Light Cavalry 1784-1990\\" The regiment was then attached to the 254th Indian Tank Brigade,page 3, Loyalty & Honour‚Äô The Indian Army September 1939 ‚Äì August 1947 - Volume 2 Brigades in November 1941. The brigade came under the command of Brigadier Reginald Scoones. When it was moved to Imphal in November and December 1943 the 254th Indian Tank Brigade consisted of the following major units: *7th Light Cavalry *3rd Carabiniers *3rd Btn 4th Bombay Grenadiers The brigade served with the 5th Indian Division and the 7th Indian Infantry Divisions in Burma. It participated in the Battle of Imphal, Battle of Kyaukmyaung Bridgehead, Battle of Meiktila, and Operation Dracula (Rangoon Road). In June 1945 the 7th Light Cavalry sailed from Rangoon to Madras and by July was stationed at Ahmednagar. In August 1945 it was selected to form part of the British Indian Division (BRINDIV) This division served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces (BCOF) as part of the Allied Occupation Forces in Japan. The move to Japan occurred during March/April 1946. The regiment returned to India in August 1947. Post war In 1947 the regiment passed to the independent nation of India.The Muslim squadron was transferred to the new Army of Pakistan, to be replaced by a Jat squadron from another unit of the former British Indian Army. The 7th Light Cavalry now consisted of two Jat squadrons and one Sikh squadron. From late 1947 it played a key role in the Jammu & Kashmir operations, surmounting the heights of Zojila at 11,500 feet, and the break-through on 1 November 1948. The first troop leader was Capt Sharakdev Singh Jamwal. The commanding officer of the Regiment was awarded the coveted Maha-Vir-Chakra.p105 - 123 \\"We Lead\\" compiled by Col JDS Jind edited by Brig.

In 1814 the uniform was changed to dark blue with orange facings. In 1817 a general order instructed that the dress of all regular native cavalry in the service of the HEIC should be changed to French grey (a light blue/grey colour). This was to remain the full dress coat colour of the 7th Light Cavalry until 1914.

Built in 1873, it served as a public primary school until 1953. The school was one of 53 octagonal schoolhouses built in the United States, of which only three survive. The building is now used as a museum by the Randolph County Historical Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The one-room schoolhouse is a one-story building with an octagonal plan. The building's foundation is made of locally quarried limestone, while the building's walls were built with red brick. A louvered belfry, which may not have been added until 1883, tops the building's low- sloping roof. Courses of corbelled brick along the roof line form the building's cornice. The vestibule at the school's entrance is sided with clapboard and rests on a concrete foundation. 53 octagonal schoolhouses were built in the United States, of which the school was the only one built in Illinois. The school is one of three of these octagonal schoolhouses which is still standing. History Built in 1873, the Charter Oak Schoolhouse was the third public school built at its location. The first school building was a simple log structure built in 1848. The second school building, a frame structure constructed in 1863, was destroyed by a tornado, necessitating the construction of a new building. Contractor William H. Holcomb constructed the third building at a cost of $1000. The school's teacher, Daniel Bishop Ling, proposed the construction of an octagonal building, which he believed would allow more light into the classroom and be more likely to survive severe winds. In addition to classes, the school building also hosted local meetings, competitions, and political events during its tenure as a school. The school closed in 1953, as did all other one-room schoolhouses in the area. The Randolph County Historical Society purchased the building in 1960 and subsequently restored it and converted it to an interpretive center of the history of the one-room schoolhouse. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 11, 1978.

He is best remembered by Cincinnatians for hosting the Skipper Ryle Show for seventeen years on WKRC Television. Early life Ryle attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati during World War II. A member of the class of 1945, he became a member of the second of five chapters of the Cincinnati- based Fraternity Triginta Optimi. At age 17, Ryle left school to enter military service with the United States Marines. At one point in his service career he briefly participated in a War Bond drive with war hero Pappy Boyington .Cincinnati Broadcast Pioneers Following his discharge, Ryle was a civilian advisor for the Israeli military in the Middle East during the time when this territory was being created. In June 1950 Ryle was recalled to active duty with the start of hostilities in the Korean War. He served in Korea just over a year. Radio & Television Career On advice from a friend in Huntington, WV, Ryle, against his own better judgment and with no prior experience or training, became involved in broadcasting and joined WMOH radio in Hamilton. His inexperience, and also his potential, caught the attention of Cecil Hale of the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, who took Ryle under his wing, improving his skills. Ryle was later hired briefly by WLWT; his first on-camera commercial was on Midwestern Hayride plugging B.C. Headache Powders. His stint at WLWT was very short-lived, and he continued at WMOH until he auditioned for and won a staff announcer position at WCPO-TV, where he performed additional duties including hosting a short-lived kids show (on this show he was a localized version of Captain Midnight); he also hosted a late night movie show, cleaned pianos, and even ran a boom microphone on Paul Dixon's pantomime show. Ryle was released from WCPO after a year and a half, and soon went to work as a writer/producer for the Ralph Jones Advertising Agency. In the fall of 1954 Ryle received a phone call from Paul Shoemaker at WKRC-TV offering Ryle another television job, which he immediately accepted. At WKRC Ryle reprised most of the duties he had at WCPO‚Äîstaff announcing and hosting a movie matinee show. A year after hiring on at WKRC he co-created and hosted The Skipper Ryle Show and in the 70s hosted the local weeknight version of Bowling for Dollars. Early in his career Ryle was one of six staff announcers at Channel 12, but ultimately it was Ryle's voice that became synonymous with WKRC, especially its Station IDs and promos; Ryle remained at WKRC for 35 years. Skipper Ryle In the late winter-early spring of 1956, Ryle was chosen by WKRC executives to host a children's show consisting mostly of cartoons; the show was initially going to be called Hi, Kids!, but then Ryle's military experience asserted itself, and when he started adding messages about river and boat safety, the producers decided to go with a riverboat setting which, with Cincinnati being right on the Ohio River, was a perfect fit. Then someone suggested the nickname \\"Skipper\\", which Ryle liked, and thus the name of the show was changed. In the show's earlier years, Ryle donned a Naval peacoat and matching peaked cap with a gray wig and bushy mustache, adopting an \\"old man of the sea\\" motif, but by the early 60s the wig had been discarded and Ryle had grown a real mustache of his own. The rousing seafaring song \\"Blow High, Blow Low\\" from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Carousel was used as the show's theme. The Skipper Ryle Show became an surprise hit and ultimately ran seventeen years on WKRC. Originally an hour- long Saturday morning show, it later moved to Sundays for two hours, and later still became a weekday series. At its peak the show was second only to WCPO's Uncle Al Show in popularity among kids. Part of the show's larger appeal was that Ryle was never condescending in his talks with the kids who appeared on the show. Despite the fact that his own personal primary demographic was kids who had felt they had outgrown Uncle Al, Ryle tried to, as he once put it, \\"open the whole thing up to everybody\\", young and old alike. Colleague Nick Clooney and other local critics once regarded Skipper Ryle as the most civilized children's show on television. The show became so popular that Ryle made in-person appearances at local amusement parks including Coney Island, LeSourdsville Lake, and even at the Cincinnati Zoo. In the early 70s, Ryle, in an attempt to compete with rival WXIX's Sunday morning powerhouse Wonderama, hosted a limited-run weekend series called the Skipper Ryle Special which featured a live audience, games and guest stars; over the years Ryle gave away countless prizes from Cincinnati-based Kenner Toys. But by 1973, though the show was still very popular, WKRC executives, citing increasing expense, decided to cancel production of the show. Personal life The Ryles lived in the western Cincinnati suburb of Cheviot. Ryle's wife, Jacqueline, was a Cincinnati native; they had two children, Steve and Cheri. Ryle maintained a low profile after his retirement in the late 80s. His final public appearance was an interview by colleague and long-time friend Nick Clooney at WCET in the fall of 1990. He died in 1993 and was buried in Bridgetown Cemetery in Cheviot. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82389502/glenn-ryle-schnitker Find-A-Grave entry for Glenn Ryle References External links * Ryle's interview and final TV appearance (with Nick Clooney) from October 1990 Categories Category:American television personalities Category:Television personalities from Cincinnati Category:1993 deaths Category:1927 births Category:People from Cheviot, Ohio ","title":"Glenn Ryle"},{"id":"18235809","text":"Mount Ashwood is a mountain on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, located north of Woss. in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia See also *List of mountains of Canada References Ashwood, Mount ","title":"Mount Ashwood"},{"id":"18235830","text":"Limbe or Limb√© may refer to: Places * Limbe, Cameroon, a seaside city in the South West Region of Cameroon * Limb√© Arrondissement, an arrondissement in the Nord department of Haiti ** Limb√©, Nord, a commune in the Limb√© Arrondissement * Rivi√®re du Limb√®, a river in Haiti * Limbe, Malawi, a town Schools * Government High School (GHS) Limbe, Cameroon * Government Bilingual High School Limbe, Cameroon Other uses * , a type of flute in traditional Mongolian music - see List of Mongolian musical instruments See also * Limb (disambiguation) ","title":"Limbe"},{"id":"18235841","text":"anyKode Marilou is a modeling and simulation environment for mobile robots, humanoids, articulated arms and parallels robots operating in real-world conditions that respect the laws of physics.

Produced by Gorky Film Studio (Yalta branch). The film was loosely based on the fairy-tale The Feather of Finist the Falcon with the same name by I. Shestakov. Finest, the brave Falcon was the final project of the famous fantasy film director Alexander Rou, who wrote the script and was going to direct it, but died before the production begun. The movie was dedicated to his memory. Plot In ancient times a simple plowman lives in Russia by the name of Finist who is friends with a falcon. The falcon warns Finist about enemies who want to capture Russia. Finist successfully chases the foreign invaders away. The other side is unhappy with the emergence of a bogatyr- defender in Russia. Their chief, sorcerer Kartaus-Red Mustache sends his henchman Kastryuk the werewolf to get rid of the hero. Using deception he lures Finist into a dungeon where he enchants him and turns him into a monster. At the Russian outpost a voivode with druzhina prepare to repel raiding enemies. For this purpose city clerk Yashku is sent to search for Finist. During his journey, Yashka meets Finist's bride Alyonushka. As they go along the road together to find Finist, they meet peasant Agathon and his wife Anfisa, who at that were about to go to the fair, but fearing a monster's roar were forced to stay in the forest. Suddenly an old woman appears, Neninla, who proclaims that it is possible to make a wish on a fern and that it would be fulfilled this night. Also, the old woman says that the monster is a bewitched person and the curse will be undone if under a monster's guise he will be loved by a fair maiden. In a debate about what kind of a wish to make, Anfisa heatedly tells Agathon to \\"disappear off the face of the earth\\". Blaming Yashka for this, the next day she returns him to the outpost demanding the return of Agathon and Alyonushka follows them. Meanwhile, Kartaus sends Kastryuk to the frontier, so that he disguised as a merchant gets inside and opens the gates to the enemies of the war-leader. But Kastryuk is uncovered by jocular old women and he is pushed into the pantry together with shrewish Anfisa. Soon Kartaus sends his servants to capture the outpost. But this time the monster gets through by a breach to the outpost. Alyonushka, knowing that this monster is Finist, covers him with a red cloak which she wanted to gift him. The curse is coming off and Finist becomes a man again. Together with druzhina he drives away his enemies. Sitting in a pantry, Kastryuk attempts to persuade Anfisa to help him fulfill his nefarious plans, giving her a magic comb to send the hero to sleep. Anfisa untangles Kastryuk's hands and sticks a comb into Finist's hair. Kastryuk transports Anfisa and sleeping Finist to Kartaus' den. Again Alyonushka goes to rescue the bogatyr. To protect the girl Yashka hires a war-lord for her. With the help of jocular old women who miraculously appear in Kartaus' den, Alyonushka and Yashka free Finist. Finist sends them home and he deals with Kartaus.

The band played extensively in Southern California and the Bay Area through the early nineties headlining smaller clubs and as opening act for such notable thrash/metal bands as Anthrax, Testament, Metal Church, Danzig, King Diamond, Sacred Reich, Meliah Rage and Vio-Lence. Attaxe was invited by Vio-lence to be an opening act on the infamous Oppressing The Masses album release show in June 1990 at the Omni in Oakland, CA. Attaxe was featured on the premiere issue No. 1 of the video magazine \\"Tales From The Pit\\" released in 1990. According to TFTP creator Jerry Allen in 2008 \\"Attaxe (this line up(1990)) was definitely our favorite unsigned band from back in the day. Although a SOCAL band, they sounded more like Bay Area Thrash in the same league as Vio-lence and Testament. These guys should have been huge in our opinion. We still play their Lethal Deception demo to this day. Skelly was definitely one of the best frontmen we've seen. Too bad this band didn't do more. The video we filmed was for Tales From The Pit No. 1\\\\. It was recorded shortly before the band's Lethal Deception demo came out. The audio is from a live Hollywood metal show and is a mono board recording. Even with its limitations, the live audio shows what a vicious band they were out of the studio. I prefer this live version of \\"Living in Fear\\" over the polished demo version. It's way more raw and ripping. Would love to see a reunion.\\" The band officially disbanded in 1994.

Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah (; abbreviated MOZAC) is the only science school and one of the two fully residential schools (Sekolah Berasrama Penuh) in the state of Malacca, Malaysia. Established in 1973 under the Second Malaysia Plan, it is the first boarding school in Malacca. The school is widely known as MOZAC and the students bears the name Muzaffarians. In 2010, the school was awarded with the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance School, a title awarded to the 20 schools in Malaysia that have met stringent criteria including academic achievement, strength of alumni, international recognition, network and linkages. The school is specialised in green technology, agriculture, robotics and electronics. Most of the students became engineers and doctors.The school is a member of Strategic Educational Alliance of Southeast Asia. History The school was established in 1973 under the Second Malaysia Plan. It was built on the top of a hilly area in Ayer Keroh, Malacca, at 121.9 meters above sea level and in an area encompassing 12.9 hectare. The buildings were completed in 1976. It was officially opened by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Melaka in 1983 as Sekolah Menengah Sains Melaka. The first batch consisted of 120 Form 1 students and 160 Form 4 students who started on 5 January 1973 at a temporary location, Sekolah Menengah Munsyi Abdullah. The students were then transferred to Sekolah Menengah Sains Johor, Kluang, Johor because the buildings in Ayer Keroh were not completed. At first, the school had 22 classes, office, library, staff room, language lab, media room, counselling room, koperasi, living skills workshop for Ekonomi Rumah Tangga (ERT) and Kemahiran Manipulatif Tambahan (KMT), dentist room, sick bay, hostel office and others. In 2001, Al-Abrar surau was built and officially opened by Yang di-Pertua Negeri Melaka as well as the construction of spotlights in the school, hostel and field. The school was provided with free Wi-Fi service by the Melaka government to encourage the spread of information and communications technology (ICT) among students. In 1976, the school was entrusted by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia to conduct its matriculation course. The matriculation courses were carried out for SPM school leavers who wanted to pursue their studies in the university's Faculty of Medicine. The first batch of matriculation consisted of 102 students from all over the country. The name \\"Sekolah Menengah Sains Melaka\\" was changed to Sekolah Muzaffar Syah Melaka in October 1983 while retaining the same acronym S.M.S.M and also a denomination given after the fourth Sultan of Melaka Sultanate, Muzaffar Shah of Malacca. Muzaffar also means 'winning' in Arabic. In 1998, the school was grouped as one of the 88 Smart Schools in Malaysia. In 2007, MOZAC field was utilized as the training ground for the winning Manchester United during 2007 Champions Youth Cup and was upgraded. A landslide, however, occurred later that year. Most of the upper side of the field was severely affected, causing the field to lose it firmness. In 2008, the school was granted the title Cluster School followed by the prestigious High Performance School in 2010.In 2015, Alumni building were erected to accommodate Alumni Association needs followed by the rebuilding of Al-Abrar surau. MOZAC acronym Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah is renowned for its catchy acronym, MOZAC. The history was still unknown until now. Rumours said that goes back to 1999 when the school was acknowledged as the best in the country based on the 1998 SPM results.http://utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=1999&dt;=0402&pub;=utusan_malaysia&sec;=muka_hadapan&pg;=fp_01.htm The current Prime Minister of Malaysia, then Education Minister, Dato' Seri Haji Mohamad Najib Razak, flew by a chopper and landed on the school field to announce the news. Due to the performance that year, the school was promoted to change its given name to Muzzafar College, which serves as the basis for the acronym MOZAC. Due to the fact that it is the only science school in Melaka, the State Education Department objected to the name change. Even though the name was not changed, the acronym remains widely used. However, on melakacool.com a former 1995 student of Muzaffar Syah denied the fact. He claimed that the name MOZAC was there way before 1998. Even before the result of SPM 1998 was announced, the school had always been known as MOZAC. The name MOZAC was in existence for student's way back in time (although might not be approved by teachers and powers that be). Student life There are seven student bodies in MOZAC. They are the Prefectural Board, Missionary and Spiritual Board (BADRI), House System Board, Librarian Board, KOSMOZ Board and Peer Counsellors (PRS). The leaders of BADRI and House System are under the Prefectural Board as these are influential bodies in the school, immediately after the prefects. There are four houses in MOZAC: Bendahara (Yellow), Syahbandar (Green), Temenggung (Red) and Laksamana (Blue). Previously, before the school was renamed, the houses were named known as Beta, Omega, Sigma and Alpha. The sports that are popular in MOZAC are rugby (MOZAC DRAGON), basketball (MOZAC KNIGHTS), softball, volleyball (MOZAC SPIKERS), netball (MOZAC TITANIUM), and football. Others sports played by the students include hockey [ (MOHOC)], sepak takraw and badminton. The uniformed bodies are the all-boys Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia (PKBM), all-girls Persatuan Puteri Islam (PPI), Kadet Remaja Sekolah Malaysia (KRS), Air Scouts, Kadet Pertahanan Awam Malaysia (KPA), Malaysian Red Crescent Society (PBSM) and Wind Orchestra (WO). The niche area of MOZAC is Research and Development (R&D;). Earlier, when it was awarded the Cluster School status, there were three niche areas: k-teroka (R & D), e-MOZAC (ICT) and e-Tinta (Writing). The three were combined into the single R&D; in 2012. In recent years, MOZAC has been known for pioneering other schools in this area. In 2009, the school produced its own thumb drive known as i-MOZAC (not to be confused with Apple's products). The lights in the school fully uses LED that are assembled by the students. In addition, it is also known for its robotics and F1 in Schools programmed. Recently, the school started to do research involving the potential of green technology. The school WO team made it to the Wind Orchestra Finale in 2002 and 2003. The best conductor award was given to the school in 2002 and was the fourth out of eight teams in 2003.

The company is headquartered in Singapore and London. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by City Developments Limited in September 2019. Millennium Hotels and Resorts operates the Lengs, M, Millennium and Copthorne hotel collections. History Part of the original Copthorne Hotel near Gatwick in West Sussex The Group's origins date to 1972 when British Caledonian Airways acquired the Copthorne Hotel at Copthorne, West Sussex, near Gatwick. The Copthorne Hotels brand was launched in 1985. In 1989, Singapore-based CDL Hotels International acquired six hotels in Asia. In 1993, CDL made its first move outside Asia ‚Äì purchasing the 548-room Gloucester Hotel and The Bailey's Hotel in London. In the same year CDL took control of a 13-hotel chain in New Zealand. In 1994, CDL made its entry into the US with the purchase of the Millennium Hilton New York Downtown in New York and acquired the Millennium Broadway in New York's Times Square district in December. In 1995, CDL Hotels acquired Copthorne Hotels and the enlarged corporation became Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. In 1999, the company acquired Regal Hotels in the United States and in 2001 it expanded into the Middle East with several management contracts secured in the United Arab Emirates. The first of six new hotels in China opened in 2008. In 2015, the group announced four new hotels to open in Dubai. Still in 2015, the group's financial results slightly declined due to troubled events affecting tourism worldwide which led to the resignation of its CEO Aloysius Lee. Tan Kian Seng began serving as the interim CEO after Jennifer Fox stepped down as the group's CEO in September 2018, just three months after her appointment. Clarence Tan was appointed CEO of Millennium and Copthorne Hotels in March 2020, and left the role in July 2020 four months after his appointment. In May 2020, Millennium & Copthorne announced 910 job losses from its 20 hotels in New Zealand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In reaction to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels created the We Clean We Care We Welcome Global Safety Commitment. Ownership In June 2019 the company's board agreed to recommend a takeover offer, valuing the business at ¬£2.23 billion, from City Developments Limited for the shares it does not already own.

He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, advancing to three Final Fours. He was a member of the winningest class in UCLA history with 123 wins. Aboya grew up and attended high school in Cameroon before attending prep school in the United States. He attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned his undergraduate degree in three years while playing four seasons for the Bruins. Aboya began his professional career in France, and later played in Japan, Venezuela, Turkey, and Libya. He also played in the United States in the NBA Development League (now known as the G League). Early life Aboya was born in Yaound√©, Cameroon to his mother, Kedi Kofane Angele, and his father, Baliaba Aboya Casimir. He graduated from high school in Cameroon and then attended prep school at Tilton School in Tilton, New Hampshire. He was recruited by Tilton coach Scott Willard, who had only seen a picture of Aboya soaring for a slam dunk. The school was looking to grow its international student population, and it was developing an English as a Second Language program. Tilton had never had any students from Africa, and while Aboya spoke a couple of languages, none of them were English. He was a star in two sports including basketball. Though he had already graduated from high school, Aboya was willing to sacrifice two years at Tilton as a path toward an American university education. He was a raw player when he began at Tilton. He became a dominant center by his senior year, and he drew attention from colleges like Georgetown and UCLA. On a visit to the West Coast, Aboya became friends with Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who grew up near him in Yaound√©. College career Oregon State's Daniel Deane in 2009. Joined by Mbah a Moute, Aboya began attending UCLA in the fall of 2005. The two teammates relied on each other for support. UCLA advanced to the Final Four in each of Aboya's first three seasons. In his freshman year, he was originally set to be a starter until he had arthroscopic surgery on both knees, delaying his debut until the seventh game of the season. He played 33 games, starting two, in 2005‚Äì06. In his sophomore year, he played in 35 of the Bruins' 36 games, including one start. That season, he had almost as many offensive rebounds (68) as he did defensive rebounds (79). As a junior in 2006‚Äì07, Aboya was one of four teammates to play in all 39 games. He made 17 starts, playing 15.2 minutes per game while averaging 2.9 points and 2.2 rebounds. In his senior year in 2008‚Äì09, UCLA relied on him as a rebounder after Mbah a Moute and Kevin Love had left for the National Basketball Association (NBA). Aboya averaged 9.9 points and 6.3 rebounds a game, both personal bests. He drew praise for his defense, and also developed a jump shot. Aboya and fellow senior teammates Darren Collison and Josh Shipp finished their careers as the winningest class in UCLA history with 123 wins. The distinction was relative, as John Wooden's legendary teams played shorter seasons and freshmen were ineligible. Academically, Aboya felt he had fallen behind during his two years in prep school. He worked with his academic adviser to earn his undergraduate degree in three years, graduating with a grade point average over 3.0 in international relations. In his fourth year, he began work on his master's degree in public policy. He aspired to one day become the president of Cameroon. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2009 NBA draft, he joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2009 NBA Summer League. In September 2009, he signed with BCM Gravelines.Gravelines adds size with Aboya However, he was released a week later.Rob Lewin signs for Gravelines In October 2009, he signed with Olympique Antibes of the LNB Pro B, before joining Link Tochigi Brex of the Japan Basketball League (JBL) in January 2010. In the summer of 2010, he signed with the Hitachi Sunrockers of the JBL for the 2010‚Äì11 season. He signed with Bucaneros de La Guaira of Liga Profesional de Baloncesto for the 2012 season, but he left in February 2012 and in March moved to Final Gen√ßlik of the Turkish Basketball Second League. He played the 2012‚Äì13 season with Shiga Lakestars of Japan before being released in early 2013. In March 2013, he moved back to Final Gen√ßlik.

Early life Phoenix was born on 26 February 1966 in Greater Manchester, England. After attending Turton High school in Bolton he studied Biochemistry at Liverpool University and graduated BSc. He remained at Liverpool to complete his doctorate on penicillin binding proteins. Career After postdoctoral work in England and the Netherlands, he began work at the University of Central Lancashire where he became Deputy Vice-Chancellor before being appointed as Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of London South Bank University. Academic background Phoenix read biochemistry and obtained his BSc degree from the University of Liverpool followed by completion of a doctorate, in biochemistry. He continued to study part-time and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Open University in mathematics. Further study generated a master's degree in education and later a master's degree in business administration. His contribution to the field of biochemistry was rewarded by the presentation of the degree of Doctor of Science from Liverpool University. This higher doctorate recognised his work into the importance of amphiphilicity in the localisation and function of bioactive molecules. He has published widely on the structure-function relationship of amphiphilic biomolecules, obtaining a Chair in Biochemistry in 2000. He has held Visiting Chairs in Russia, China, and Canada. In addition to peer-reviewed papers, edited collections and research monographs he has also been recognised for publication of undergraduate textbooks. And has been Editor in Chief for journals focused on education and for periodicals such as Biologist which are aimed at a broader readership. Research The group is multidisciplinary and draws on a range of specialties including, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics and computational modelling to help develop understanding of the structure function relationships used by amphiphilic bioactive molecules. The term ‚Äò‚Äòpeptide-amphiphile‚Äô‚Äô can be used to describe amphiphilic peptides consisting only of amino acids that show segregation of charged and uncharged components within the primary or secondary structure. Alternatively, they may be composed of hydrophilic peptides linked to hydrophobic alkyl chains or lipids, and peptide-based copolymers. Such molecules are of significant biological importance due to the range of asymmetric boundaries that occur in nature such as those found at a membrane lipid interface. Amphiphilic protein sequences can be involved in protein targeting, membrane protein assembly as well as membrane fusion and lysis. In addition to amphiphilic peptides possessing key biological functions amphiphiles are becoming of increasing interest in the creation of new biomaterials. Amphiphiles can self-assemble into a variety of different structures such as micelles, vesicles, monolayers, bilayers, nanofibers, nanotapes, ribbons, and twisted ribbons, to minimise unfavorable interactions with their surroundings. A key aspect of his work involves the development of bioactive peptides and new biomaterials with biomedical application.

In 2008 his work in support of teaching was recognised by the award of a Senior Fellowship by the Higher Education Academy and later advanced to Principal Fellow Career history His PhD work engaged his interest in the role amphiphilicity plays in driving the interaction of bioactive molecules with cell membranes. He was awarded a long-term fellowship by the European Molecular Biology Organisation which enabled him to investigate the importance of amphiphilicity in protein translocation at Utrecht University Centre for Biomembranes and Lipid Enzymology. He continued to work on amphiphilic helices, being one of the first to help characterise their role as membrane protein anchors. He later expanded this work to investigate the importance of structure-function relationships in the design of antimicrobial peptides. In 2000 he launched a new Department of Forensic and Investigative Science at the University of Central Lancashire and in 2002 he became Dean of Science and Technology when he launched a new School of Pharmacy. During this time he also remained the UK representative on the European Committee of Biological Associations (ECBA) and for a while was a Commissioner for Biotechnology. He remains an international advisor on higher education and science to the University of Guyana. In 2008 he became Deputy Vice-Chancellor with responsibility for strategic planning and performance across the University of Central Lancashire group.

Rioters smashed government buildings and torched several police cars to protest against an alleged police cover-up of a girl's death. Incident =Alleged rape and murder= A 16-year-old local girl by the name of Li Shufen (ÊùéÊ†ëËä¨, born in July 1991) was found dead in a river. She had been earlier spotted with two younger men who allegedly had familial ties with the local public security bureau. Li Shufen's family and friends have said that she was raped and murdered by the son of a prominent Weng'an official and another youth and that her corpse was then thrown into the river. The subsequent media release denied the claims, and states the two young men and one young woman involved are of local farmers' families.

This roused an angry mob of thousands of people, who began overturning cars and setting fire to government buildings, including the local Communist party headquarters.

Role of Chinese bloggers *Zhou Shuguang, a self-claimed citizen journalist also known as \\"Zola\\" in the Chinese blogosphere, went to Weng'an to conduct a personal interview with Li Shufen's family, using all the Internet communication tools like MSN, QQ, and Twitter, plus his own cell phone, posting to his personal web page unofficial reports along with photos and pleas from the family of the Li Shufen. It was believed that this was the first time Twitter had ever been used to report a mass Chinese protest. Zhou, as well as many other like-minded Chinese netizens, provide on-the-scene information on events like this, as a means to give voice to ordinary Chinese whose stories get overlooked or censored in a country where all the media is under the control of China's Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. *Tianya.cn, a social networking website (owned by Hainan Tianya Online Networking Technology Co.) that offers various chat rooms for bloggers to discuss social issues, played an indispensable role in the supporting of the students' actions during the riot. As reported by Jonathan Ansfield on blog.newsweek.com/July 2, 2008: Roland Soong of East South West North, a well known website that does Chinese- to-English translations, wrote: *Xinhua, the official central government news agency, played an unusual role in this incident, simply by keeping open a chat room for bloggers to voice their anger towards the local bunkering and incompetent officials. By June 29, there had been more than 200,000 hits on the 2,000 remarks left in the chatroom of the only uncensored official Xinhua website, mostly in strong condemnation of the way that the corrupt police mishandled the girl's death and used excessive force against protestors. *At several other popular forums or chat sites, including Kdnet (), Maopu (), Strong Nation (), Sina.com, Netese (), and QQ, most of the users voiced their support for the Weng'an rioters, and they all supply their own versions of information (including text, photos, and sometimes video files), different, or sometimes opposite to the versions supplied by the Guizhou police. Arrests Authorities have rounded up 300 people accused of taking part in the riot. Other sources have said 200 rioters were arrested. Over 1,500 paramilitary and riot police were dispatched to the county. Police detained 59 people for their alleged roles. Government response Photographs as well as comments on the Guizhou protest in chatrooms and forums were quickly deleted by the mainland Internet censors. The government launched a campaign to defuse protest ahead of the Beijing Olympics to continue carrying out social harmony and stability. An \\"Olympics Stability Drive\\" was announced after the incident. Public security officials in Guizhou offered a total of 9,000 yuan (about $1,300 or ¬£700 or ‚Ç¨800) to the parents of the teenage girl, with 3,000 paid by each suspect. The father said \\"We will never accept an evil deal like this, we need to seek justice for our daughter.\\" Guizhou's Communist Party chief, Shi Zongyuan (), estimated that prior use of force by local officials have contributed to the widespread discontentment. He further said the deep rooted reasons behind the protest were \\"rude and roughhand solutions\\" by local authorities to solve disputes over mines, demolition of homes for public projects, relocation of residents for reservoir construction, and many other issues.Xinhuanet. \\"Xinhuanet.\\" Two more officials sacked after violent protest over teens' death. Retrieved on 2008-07-04. Several local officials, including Weng'an's Party chief, have been dismissed for breach of duty on July 3 and 4, 2008. Investigation The government Guizhou Daily newspaper claimed the family was too emotionally unstable to accept the findings. The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said three men were questioned, but were let go. Xinhua News Agency reported on July 1, 2008 that the investigation would be reopened. The provincial government sent 10 criminal investigators and forensic experts to re-investigate the death. The autopsy was carried out by five experts from the Guizhou public security department and the Higher People's Court. After three autopsies, there were no signs of any sexual attack according to state officials. The girl's father, Li Xiuzhong, did not accept the autopsy findings. He said \\"There is nothing I can do, they have sent 10 officials to my home, watching me day and night. They told me what to say when the reporters interviewed me. They threatened me that [if I said anything wrong], then another riot can happen and I must bear in mind that national security is at stake.\\" Li Shufen was buried in her hometown about 20 km from Weng'an. Provincial authority said that every year, about 600 to 800 criminal cases take place in the county, but half of them are not solved.

The duo, composed of Greg Scelsa and Steve Millang, has been performing and recording children's music since the 1970s. Scelsa and Millang both perform as vocalists and guitarists. They have recorded 20 albums, one music video compilation, and one live concert DVD. Greg & Steve are marketed toward children from preschool age through primary school and have sold more than 4 million albums, making them the best selling children's music duo in the United States. They also have a rigorous concert schedule, playing an average of 100 shows per year including venues such as Carnegie Hall. Scelsa and Millang, who have known each other since high school, moved from their hometown of Newport Beach, California to Los Angeles to \\"be closer to the music business\\" in 1968. They took jobs as special education assistants, and soon started performing music for the children, many of whom had emotional or behavioral problems. They found that their music had a positive effect on children with disorders such as autism. For the next several years, they performed their music program for different schools. In 1975, they decided to form a record company, Youngheart Records, and presented a recording of their music to National Association for the Education of Young Children convention attendees. After receiving a positive reaction at the conference, Scelsa and Millang formed \\"Greg & Steve\\" and began selling their recordings in the educational market. In 1991, Scelsa and Millang sold the majority interest of Youngheart Records to Creative Teaching Press and have expanded into internet and retail sales. The expansion allowed them to begin selling their music in larger markets such as retailers Barnes & Noble, and allowed them to focus on their music rather than on business tasks. As of 2002, Greg & Steve have received nine Parents' Choice Awards. In 2010, their album Jumpin' and Jammin was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children.

BAE Systems announced its intention to acquire the company from Tenix in January 2008 and the acquisition was completed in June 2008 for A$775 million (¬£373 million). BAE Systems Australia thus became Australia's largest defence contractor. The company was formed in 1997 after it was split from parent company Transfield Services. It was part of Tenix until the defence contracting arm became known as Tenix Defence. It had two divisions: Tenix Marine and Tenix Aerospace and Defence (comprising the former Land, Aerospace and Electronic Systems divisions). Land Tenix Defence provided design, manufacture, modification and repairs to all major in-service military vehicles in Australia. It had over 300 employees in Wingfield, South Australia and Bandiana, Victoria. Wingfield was Australia's largest privately operated military vehicle facility, offering engineering, integrated logistic support, through-life support, configuration management, prototyping, warehousing, production and paint shop facilities. At Bandiana, the Land Division provided logistic and garrison support services to Joint Logistics Command. This included warehousing and heavy grade maintenance of artillery, guided weapons, armoured and non-armoured vehicles and other Army weapon systems. Major projects undertaken by the Land Division included LAND 106 M113 Upgrade Project and 10 Armoured Limousines (based upon the Holden Caprice) for the Australian Attorney-General‚Äôs Department. Marine HMAS Anzac operating in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Tenix Defence Marine Division was a major ship designer and builder in the Asia Pacific region focusing on the delivery of solutions to defence and commercial opportunities for both new build and support activities. New construction, repairs and maintenance were undertaken at Australian shipyards in Williamstown, Victoria and Henderson, Western Australia. Both facilities also performed in-service support. The Whangarei site in New Zealand fabricated ANZAC superstructure and hull modules, plus build the four patrol boats for the RNZN Protector Project. Other facilities were located in Darwin, Cairns, Brisbane and Sydney. The division had experience in designing, building and delivering more than 200 naval, paramilitary and specialist vessels. Ships built by Tenix Defence include ten Anzac class frigates and two Protector-class offshore patrol vessels. In June 2007, the Australian Minister for Defence announced that Tenix Defence was the preferred tenderer for the construction of the two Canberra class large amphibious ships known as Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ships at a cost of $3 billion. The ships, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide, entered into service in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Tenix had proposed to build the Navantia design in partnership with the Spanish company. Aerospace Through its heritage, Tenix Defence had an unbroken chain of experience in the Australian aviation industry spanning six decades. The Aerospace Division was established in 1998 specifically to provide a support capability for Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft programs. It gained Authorised Engineering Organisation Certification to conduct design on a number of defence aircraft. The Division also held an Australian Department of Defence certification for Earned Value Management. It was managed from Melbourne, and had its own hangar at Melbourne Airport. The division also worked on projects with the ADF on-site at HMAS Albatross at Nowra, RAAF Williamtown and RAAF Edinburgh. Electronic Systems Electronic Systems Division (ESD) was the technology and electronic systems hub of Tenix Defence and maintained close ties with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. It was a provider of integrated solutions for Network Enabled Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare and Network Centric Warfare (NCW). Major projects undertaken by the Electronic Systems Division included Advanced Air Defence Simulator (AADS) to train Australian Army operators in the SAAB Bofors Dynamics RBS-70 Ground Based Air Defence weapon, LAND 53, Phase 1E Ninox Ground Surveillance Radar, Phase 1F Ninox Thermal Surveillance System and Phase 2B Ninox Unattended Ground Sensors.

Boundaries *North‚ÄìOakdale Road *South‚ÄìCold Spring Lane *East‚ÄìStony Run Park *West‚ÄìMayadier Lane Zip code‚Äì21210 History The Evergreen neighborhood is located in North Baltimore and was one of the first residential developments in its area, coming even before Roland Park. The land subdivided to become Evergreen was inherited by an heir of the Cockey family in 1813 and was originally called ‚ÄúRidgely‚Äôs Whim.‚Äù Lewand, Karen. North Baltimore, from estate to development. The Dept., 1989. In 1873, two men named Brooks and Barton purchased the land and began to create a neighborhood called Evergreen for middle-class workers and their families. The Evergreen is a rare example of an early non-rowhouse suburban-style community. The neighborhood was easily accessible, despite being several miles from the heart of Baltimore. There were two railroad stops on opposite corners of the neighborhood; one was at Cold Spring Lane and one at Oakdale. This connection to the city allowed the neighborhood to grow and thrive. However, neither of these railroad stations exists today. The neighborhood was overwhelmingly composed of hard-working citizens. Many of its residents were builders and tradesmen who worked in Roland Park during its major period of construction from 1895 to 1910. Most of Roland Park's firemen (who were mostly volunteers) ironically lived in the Evergreen neighborhood. Spellman, Howard C. I Remember...Roland Park's Early Firefighters. Unknown Baltimore Newspaper. Demographics According to the 2000 census, the Evergreen neighborhood is made up of 405 residents. It is a predominantly white neighborhood, with 97.5 percent of the people being white. The majority of the residents do not have children under 18 years old living in their households (though there is a considerable upward trend of young children since the census), and the median age is 35 years. About half of the residents are married. The median family income is about $65,000 per year. 43 percent of the residents are single with an average salary of $46,000 per year. Forty of the individuals are below the poverty level, and there are 34 individuals who have not completed high school. However, 195 of the residents have completed college, with 115 stopping at a bachelor's degree and 80 holding a graduate or professional degree. The most common occupations among residents are considered management and professional roles. http://censusprofile.bnia.org/Evergreen%20Demographic%20Profile.pdf Architecture and Design A typical shingle-style house in the Evergreen neighborhood The 205 houses that make up Evergreen, come in many different architectural styles. Schenley Road, Keswick Road, Wilmslow Road and Evergreen's other smaller streets feature Victorian houses as well as two- story shingle-style houses, -story Queen Anne‚Äìstyle houses and contemporaries. While Evergreen is mostly composed of residential houses, it also features a neighborhood commercial area on the south boundary at Cold Spring Lane. The neighborhood streets are set up in a grid pattern with alleys. The driveways to the houses‚Äîthat is, those few that have driveways‚Äîare accessible by the alleys. This allows the sidewalks to be unbroken by curb cuts. The houses, which face the street, are surrounded by luscious greenery. Most houses have good-sized yards, well-tended gardens and a variety of trees, shrubs, and bushes.

Plot  = Pre- Wide Awake = * 9/11 * The Greater Depression (a.k.a. The Debt, Deficit, and Fuel Depression) transpired when, after the American government began spending more and landed itself further in debt, foreign countries started asking for repayment: prices started inflating rapidly, causing a depression even greater than that of the 1930s. * The Andreas Quake occurred on 3/12 and helped to inspire the Jesus Revolution (see below). * Hurricane Wanda occurred on 7/23 and also helped to inspire the Jesus Revolution. * The Reign of Fear began when the President decided to end the Greater Depression by launching The War to End All Wars, which led to the tragic events of 4/5, unexplained to readers. The Decent party was established, and members created the Denial Education program. The Opus Dei Trials took place. * The Prada Riots took place when The War to End All Wars proved ineffective, and citizens began to protest that some people remained rich while the rest were yet struggling. * Worldwide Health Care has been established to combat the monopoly of drug companies over whole dying nations. * The Jesus Revolution, described by critic Wayne Hoffman, author of Hard, as \\"Levithan's most ingenious creation\\",Hoffman 2006. is a Christian movement promoting Jesus Christ as a messenger who preached love and peace as opposed to violence and intolerance. It encourages many of the young faithful to vote, and is thus decisive in turning the election in Stein's favour. * AIDS is a thing of the past. * The United States Supreme Court has affirmed the civil rights of homosexuals, including marriage. = Wide Awake = The novel opens with the revelation that the United States has just elected into power Abe Stein, its first openly gay (and Jewish) president. Alongside running mate Alice Martinez, Stein won a tight race by the mere margin of 1,000 Kansas votes, signalling a watershed for progressive politics, which take the limelight for the first time in decades. Although the lives of American homosexuals are drastically improved even before Stein's election, what and the country is in the main far more liberal, it remains divided along acute political lines: as Hoffman notes, \\"the pendulum has merely swung slightly to the left, thanks to voters fed up with economic inequality, ongoing health crises and a politically motivated 'War to End All Wars' against 'extremists everywhere.'\\" The novel's focus, however, is on the personal impact of the election on a teenager named Duncan, who is also Jewish and openly gay. Although too young to vote, he is a strong supporter of Stein; thus, when the conservative governor demands a recount, and Stein's followers are prevailed upon to gather in support, he finds himself in a dilemma between his parents, who want him to stay home, and his politically passionate boyfriend, who demands that he stand up for what he believes in.  Reception  Wide Awake was generally well received. Hoffman praised in particular its skilful mingling of the political with the personal, going so far as to draw comparisons with John Fox's The Boys on the Rock, although he noted dissimilarities that were far more conspicuous: \\"Just 22 years separate these books, but the worlds they inhabit seem impossibly distant.\\"Hoffman 2006. For one thing, whereas The Boys on the Rock is set in the past, Wide Awake looks to the near future, \\"likely a couple of decades from now.\\" Hoffman was not entirely impressed, though: > Predicting trends ‚Äî particularly regarding teenagers' fashions and slang ‚Äî > is difficult, and Levithan sometimes stumbles. It's hard to imagine even > politically aware teens flocking to a \\"non-mall,\\" where anti-consumers shop > for items they'd like to buy, only to forgo those purchases and donate to > charity the cash they could have spent on themselves. And it's hard to > imagine anyone actually saying, \\"There's nothing like a little non-shopping > to get your mind back to happyzoom.\\"Hoffman 2006. \\"But,\\" he noted, \\"if minor details ring false, the major elements of Wide Awake seem essentially plausible. Levithan outlines a world of new possibilities for gay Americans, without positing a utopia where homophobia has vanished and the entire country has changed political orientation.\\"  Interpretation  \\"Progressive activists have long asserted that the personal is political,\\" wrote Hoffman in his review for The Washington Post. \\"In David Levithan's young-adult novel Wide Awake, that old slogan gains new life. And the reverse is also true: In Wide Awake, the political is personal in unprecedented ways.\\" He went on to observe that, whereas in Fox's The Boys on the Rock, the main political character was in the eyes of the protagonist only a politician, \\"Duncan sees in Stein a reflection of himself. If Stein wins, Duncan shares the victory as a gay Jew who can, at last, truly imagine becoming president one day.\\"  References  * Hoffman, Wayne. \\"Gay New World\\".

In 1937, the school moved to a high mountain barracks, and would later become known as the Military Ski School. By the 1940s, Lebanon had established competitions, clubs, and ski schools throughout the country, and began competing at an international level. James Riddell, the British champion skier who was often called the Father of Modern Ski Journalism, administered in 1942 a ski and mountaineering school for the Australian 9th Army at the Cedars of God Bsharri . In 1947, Lebanon competed for the first time at the international championship in Chamonix, France, with Michel Samen carrying the Lebanese flag.

The racial make up of the neighborhood as of the 2010 census is 90.1% white, 3.6 % black or African American , 4.1% Spanish or Latino, 0.2% Native American or Hawaiian, 1.1% Asian, 4.6% mixed races. The neighborhood is encompassed in the 30318 zip code. History The area that is now known as Riverside started as a working plantation, known as the Spink Estate after its owner, James W. Spink. Spink sold the first lots, which are now occupied by the residence and carriage house at the intersection of Spink Street and Hollywood Road, for the start of this new community in 1892. An article in the Atlanta Constitution dated June 9, 1892 was titled ‚ÄúAtlanta on the Chattahoochee ‚Äì The City Has Gone Clear To the River ‚Äì The Sale at Riverside.‚Äù One of the main streets of the neighborhood is named Spink Street. Spink died suddenly in 1906 and Spink‚Äôs widow, Elizabeth, continued to live in Riverside until her death in 1910. In 1914, the remainder of the Spink Estate was sold as 300 lots and 20 small farms. In time, the farms gave way to more houses. Riverside was annexed into the city of Atlanta in 1952. Today, Riverside is a prosperous community. Streetcar The River Line was an Atlanta streetcar line that ran from 1892 to 1949. The line ran out Bellwood Ave. (now Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy.) to Almond Park and then on to the Riverside community. The line ceased operation in 1949 with the last ride to Riverside. Education Riverside, like all areas of the City of Atlanta, is part of the Atlanta Public Schools district. It is served by Bolton Academy (Elementary), Sutton Middle School, and North Atlanta High School.

He served as secretary of the Secretariat between 2007 and 2012, and as the head of the Central Policy Research Office since 2002. He was named chairman of Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization in November 2017. Wang is believed to have been one of the principal architects behind the official political ideologies of three paramount leaders: \\"Three Represents\\" by Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Development Concept by Hu Jintao, and the Chinese Dream and Xi Jinping Thought of Xi Jinping.  Early life  Born in Shanghai, Wang traces his heritage to Ye County, Shandong province. Wang's name, \\"Huning\\", literally means \\"Shanghai and Nanjing‚Äù. Wang was recommended to enter Shanghai Normal University in 1974 to study the French language. He was enrolled in the Department of International Politics at Fudan University in 1977 to pursue his postgraduate degree, while conducting research for the Shanghai Academy of Social Science. His mentors were Chen Qiren and Wang Bangzuo. After graduation, Wang stayed at Fudan University, and by 1985 was named professor of law at age 30, becoming the youngest law professor in the history of the university. In 1988, Wang was a visiting scholar in the United States for six months, spending the first three months at The University of Iowa, three weeks at Cal Berkeley, and traveled to many other universities. This experience led to his 1991 book America Against America. Beginning in the 1980s, Wang wrote columns and essays for numerous party-sanctioned publications and once appeared on the cover of news magazine Banyuetan (). His work attracted attention from political leaders in Shanghai. In 1993, Wang led the Fudan student debate team to participate in a Chinese-language international college debate competition held in Singapore. The team won the championship between 1988 and 1993, greatly enhancing Wang's reputation.  Political career From 1995, Wang was referred to work for the party's central authorities on recommendation from top Shanghai politicians Zeng Qinghong and Wu Bangguo, both of whom maintained close relationships with then-party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Wang initially headed the political research team at the Central Policy Research Office, and was promoted in April 1998 to deputy director of the Office. He was promoted to director of the Office in 2002. Wang was regarded as one of major brain-powers of Jiang Zemin and participated in the drafting of the \\"Three Represents\\" ideology, regarded as the main theoretical contribution of Jiang to the party's ideological lexicon. In November 2007, Wang was admitted to the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China. He began accompanying General Secretary Hu Jintao on foreign trips, and played a leading role in drafting the \\"Scientific Outlook on Development\\" ideology of Hu Jintao. He was elected to the 18th Politburo of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, becoming the first director of the Policy Research Office to hold a seat on the elite ruling council. Following the ascension of Xi Jinping to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, Wang nurtured a close relationship with Xi, again emerging as one of the central members of Xi's entourage on international trips and seen to be one of Xi's closest advisors. He has helped in the construction of the \\"Chinese Dream\\" and \\"Xi Jinping Thought\\" ideologies. Wang was a member of 16th, 17th and 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and is currently a member of the 19th. Wang authored several books, including Logic of Politics - the Principal of Marxism Politics, America against America, General Introduction to New Politics, Analysis of Modern Western Politics, Analysis of Comparative Politics and Debate Contest in Lion City. Wang was chosen to be a member of the 19th Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, at the 1st Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on 25 October 2017. Personal life = Family = Wang's first wife, Zhou Qi, 3 years older, ended in divorce after he went to Zhongnanhai in 1996. They had no children. He later married a nurse in Zhongnanhai. They have one child. = Public perceptions = As Xi's top foreign policy aide, he has been described as \\"China's Kissinger\\" by South Korean newspaper The Hankyoreh. He was also compared to Henry Kissinger by The Guardian.

Hanson held over 100 patents.Leveling device - Patent 2564202 He created and produced equipment that was used on the Trans-Alaskan pipeline, on canals in over 50 countries (including the California Aqueduct System) and the self-leveling control for hillside Combine Harvesters. Background Hanson was born in Potlatch, Idaho in 1923, the son of Ray & Orda (Hensley) Hanson. The family later moved to Palouse, Washington. Hanson grew up around the iconic rolling hills of the Palouse region, which would play into his first invention, the self leveling control for Combine Harvesters. Hanson attended the University of Idaho, majoring in electrical engineering. At the age of 19 while farming in Palouse, Washington he applied his engineering and farming knowledge to finding a better way to harvest the fertile but often steep slopes found in that area. In 1941 Hanson conceived of the self-leveling control for hillside combines, and by 1945 the first self leveling mechanisms were built.Today@Idaho - News Article Hanson founded the RAHCO Company to build self-leveling mechanisms and since then, RAHCO of Spokane, Washington has grown into a world leader in the design and production of custom commercial machinery systems. RAHCO estimates that automatic leveling has saved at least three percent of grain harvested on lands where combine leveling is needed, which is worth millions of dollars each year. After the self-leveling control for hillside combines, Hanson began adapting the ideas and principles he had developed into a wide variety of construction machines used for canal, highway, dam, and airport construction. He went on to found a company that became a world leader in the design and production of custom commercial machinery, including the largest canal finishing machinery in the world for the California aqueduct, the world's largest 2,000 ton gantry crane used in the Grand Coulee Dam power plant project, and creating equipment that has been used on the Alaska pipeline project. To date, Hanson has designed and marketed major construction machinery in more than 50 countries and has brought more than $150,000,000 worth of business back to the northwest and the Inland Empire. Hanson died on February 18, 2009 and is survived by his wife Lois and six children, 20 grandchildren and 24 great grandchildren.

A very small part extends northward into Oregon. It is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as the Nevada component of the Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which is headquartered in Lakeview, Oregon. The Sheldon Refuge is noted for its population of wild horses, now all removed and The Virgin Valley Mining District for Black Precious Opals,the State Gemstone, still very active with multiple fee dig mines. A point within the refuge is also the farthest place in the continuous US from a McDonald's restaurant, at just 115 miles. (185 kilometers) In 1931, the refuge was established under executive order to carry out three central goals: First, the refuge was to provide a habitat for the \\"antelope\\" (more properly called the pronghorn), an animal whose population was in decline during the early 1900s. Second, conservation efforts were put forth to protect native fish, wildlife and plants. The refuge contains the very active and popular Virgin Valley Opal Mining District and was grandfathered in with all rights. Finally, the refuge was to serve as an inviolate migratory bird sanctuary. Advocates characterize Sheldon as one of the few intact sagebrush steppe ecosystems in the Great Basin, one that hosts a variety of wildlife endemic to the unique environment. Desert fishes, greater sage-grouse, migratory birds, mule deer and the pygmy rabbit are all residents. Description The Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge occupies an arid zone of volcanic terrain. Opal miners have been active in the valley since 1906. Rockhounds search for precious opal, agates, petrified wood, Carnelian, obsidian, rhyolite, jasper, agate, hyalite opal, psilomelene. Geothermal hot springs provide some water to a swimming pool and shower house in the camp ground. The dominant ecosystem plant life consists of drought- tolerant species such as sagebrush, juniper, mountain mahogany, bitterbrush and aspen. The elevation ranges from to above sea level. quarter In this forbidding landscape lives a large population of free-range fauna, with the pronghorn - North America's fastest land mammal - being the best known and numbering around 3,500. There are also large herds of mustang, mule deer, and a small but self-sustaining population of bighorn sheep. The bighorn are not strictly native to the Sheldon Refuge, having been extirpated there during the frontier era and reintroduced about 1930. The pronghorn \\"antelope\\" played a key role in the refuge's history, as approximately 94 percent of the current protected land area was originally set aside as the Charles Sheldon Antelope Range in 1936. The refuge is the home of an endemic fish species of limited geographic distribution, the Alvord chub. The population of Sheldon horses are the descendants of horses used by the U.S. Army. Harry Wilson was one of the ranchers that sold horses to the U.S. cavalry. When the Wilsons owned the Virgin Valley Ranch, they worked with the Army, which provided thoroughbred stallions that were bred with the Wilsons' standardbreds.http://www.royalpeacock.com/virgin-valley/wilson-family-history Nevada State Route 140 traverses the refuge from east to west and is the only paved road within the refuge. The nearest community of any size is Denio, Nevada, 14 miles from the refuge's eastern boundary. The nearest divided highway is Interstate 80 in Winnemucca, Nevada, approximately 100 miles to the south. County Road 8A connects to Cedarville Ca. Controversy Proposals to cull some of the alleged excess population of mustang in the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge were drawing public concern . The official USFWS position, as stated on their refuge's website, was \\"horses and burros are not native to Sheldon Refuge. They are descended from domestic stock turned loose around the turn of the twentieth century. They are primarily grass eaters, and their grazing can devastate native vegetation and cause severe damage to riparian habitat.\\" Some private-sector advocates, such as the Sierra Club, agree with the USFWS position. In response, the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign has accused the USFWS of conducting \\"helicopter round-ups during foaling season\\" in the Sheldon Refuge. Due to the negative impact horses and burros have riparian areas and the resulting strain on native wildlife, Sheldon NWR officials announced a decision to remove all horses from the refuge by 2014 and they all were removed.http://www.fws.gov/sheldonhartmtn/sheldon/horseburro.html References Category:1931 establishments in Nevada Category:1931 establishments in Oregon Category:National Wildlife Refuges in Nevada Category:National Wildlife Refuges in Oregon Category:Protected areas established in 1931 Category:Protected areas of the Great Basin Category:Protected areas of Humboldt County, Nevada Category:Protected areas of Lake County, Oregon Category:Protected areas of Washoe County, Nevada ","title":"Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"18236929","text":"Astamur Anton-ipa Adleiba (, ) is a former Minister of Youth, Sports, Tourism and Resorts of Abkhazia and a former mayor of Abkhazia's capital Sukhumi.

Floyd kidnapped Suzanne and her siblings when their mother was incarcerated for 30 days for writing a bad check to buy diapers. One of the siblings were later recovered and the second never found, but the family could never find Suzanne despite a lifetime of searching.

After the death of church founder Joseph Smith, the doctrine was officially announced in Utah Territory in 1852 by Mormon leader Brigham Young. The practice was attributed posthumously to Smith and it began among Mormons at large, principally in Utah where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) had relocated after the Illinois Mormon War. In the years after members of the LDS Church began practicing polygamy, it drew intense scrutiny and criticism from the United States government. This criticism led to the Utah Mormon War, and eventually the abandonment of the practice under the leadership of Wilford Woodruff, who issued the 1890 Manifesto. Official sanction by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the Twelve Apostles, Orson Pratt, and church president Brigham Young in a special conference of the elders of the LDS Church assembled in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on 28 August 1852, and reprinted in the Deseret News Extra the following day. The announcement came nine years after the purported original revelation by Joseph Smith, and five years after the Mormon exodus to the Salt Lake Valley following Smith's death in Carthage, Illinois. Young was unable to produce the original document and declared that Smith's widow Emma Smith had burned it.Millennial Star Supplement, Volume 15, page 30 To this, Emma Smith replied that she had never seen such a document, and concerning the story that she had destroyed the original: \\"It is false in all its parts, made out of whole cloth, without any foundation in truth.\\"Church History, vol. 3, p, 352. Controversy and opposition by the United States government =Early tension and the Utah War (1852‚Äì58)= Polygamy was roundly condemned by virtually all sections of the American public. During the presidential election of 1856 a key plank of the newly formed Republican Party's platform was a pledge \\"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery\\".GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia from the Independence Hall Association website Further tension grew due to the relationship between \\"Gentile\\" federal appointees and the Utah territorial leadership. The territory's Organic Act held that the governor, federal judges, and other important territorial positions were to be filled by appointees chosen by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but without any reference to the will of Utah's population. Many of these federally appointed officers were appalled by the practice of polygamy and the Mormon belief system in general, and would harangue the Mormons for their \\"lack of morality\\" in public addresses. This already tense situation was further exacerbated by a period of intense religious revival starting in late 1856 dubbed the \\"Mormon Reformation.\\" The issue of polygamy among the Latter- day Saints in Utah was one of the contributing factors that lead to the Utah War, in which the President of the United States dispatched an army to Utah to quell a perceived rebellion. In the midst of the American Civil War, Republican majorities in Congress were able to pass legislation meant to curb the Mormon practice of polygamy. One such act was the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which was signed into law on July 8, 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln. The act banned plural marriage and limited church and non-profit ownership in any territory of the United States to $50,000.Statutes at Large, 37th Congress, 2nd Session, page 501. A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: US Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875. The Library of Congress. Accessed 18 May 2006. The act targeted the LDS Church's control of Utah Territory. The measure had no funds allocated for enforcement, and thus it was not rigorously enforced. The Mormons, believing that the law unconstitutionally deprived them of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to ignore the law. =Aftermath and further legislation (1858‚Äì90)= In the following years, several bills aimed at strengthening the anti-bigamy laws failed to pass the United States Congress. These included the Wade, Cragin, and Cullom bills which had their origin in the territory of Utah and were initiated by men who were bitterly opposed to the Mormon establishment. The Wade Bill initiated in 1866 would have destroyed local government if it had passed. Three years later, the Cragin Bill was proposed, but within a few days it was substituted by the Cullom Bill, which was more radical than the Wade or Cragin bills. Members of the church worked for the defeat of the bill, including women of the church, who held mass meetings throughout the territory in January 1870 in opposition to the bill. Finally, the Poland Act (18 Stat. 253) of 1874 was passed which sought to facilitate prosecutions under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act by eliminating the control members of the LDS Church exerted over the justice system of Utah Territory. Sponsored by Senator Luke P. Poland of Vermont, the Act redefined the jurisdiction of Utah courts by giving the United States district courts exclusive jurisdiction in Utah Territory over all civil and criminal cases. The Act also eliminated the territorial marshal and attorney, giving their duties to a U.S. Marshal and a U.S. Attorney. The Act also altered petit and grand jury empaneling rules to keep polygamists off juries. By removing Latter-day Saints from positions of authority in the Utah justice system, the Act was intended to allow for successful prosecutions of Mormon polygamists. Immediately, under the act, the United States Attorney tried to bring leading church officials to trial. These efforts culminated in the sentencing of George Reynolds to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of five hundred dollars for his practice of polygamy. In 1876, the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. His 1878 Reynolds v. United States appeal reached the United States Supreme Court, and in January 1879 that body ruled the anti- polygamy legislation constitutional and upheld Reynolds's prison sentence (it struck down the fine and hard labor portions). Reynolds was released from prison in January 1881, having served eighteen months of his original sentence. In February 1882, George Q. Cannon, a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the House of Representatives due to his multiple marriages. This revived the issue in national politics. One month later, the Edmunds Act was passed, amending the Morrill Act by declaring polygamy a felony, revoking a polygamist's right to vote, making them ineligible for jury service, and prohibiting them from holding political office. These restrictions were enforced regardless of whether an individual was actually practicing polygamy, or merely believed in the Mormon doctrine of plural marriage without actually participating in it. All elected offices in the Utah Territory were vacated, an election board was formed to issue certificates to those who both denied polygamy and did not practice it, and new elections were held territory-wide. Electoral obstacles to prosecution were now removed, and the new territorial officials began criminal prosecutions in ernest. Judge Charles S. Zane, the Republican appointee of Chester A. Arthur, handed down harsh sentences to church leaders, beginning with apostle Rudger Clawson. Finally, the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act of 1887 touched all the issues at dispute between the United States Congress and the LDS Church. The act disincorporated both the church and its Perpetual Emigration Fund on the grounds that they fostered polygamy. The act prohibited the practice of polygamy and punished it with a fine of from $500 to $800 and imprisonment of up to five years. It dissolved the corporation of the church and directed the confiscation by the federal government of all church properties valued over a limit of $50,000. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize the church and all of its assets. The act was enforced by the U.S. marshal and a host of deputies. The act: *Dissolved the LDS Church and the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, with assets to be used for public schools in the territory. *Required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials. *Annulled territorial laws allowing illegitimate children to inherit. *Required civil marriage licenses (to aid in the prosecution of polygamy). *Abrogated the common law spousal privilege to require wives to testify against their husbands *Disfranchised women (who had been enfranchised by the territorial legislature in 1870). * Replaced local judges (including the previously powerful Probate Court judges) with federally appointed judges. * Removed local control in school textbook choice. In 1890, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the seizure of church property under the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act in Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States. The church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, in the 1880s the leadership was left to navigate \\"underground\\". Following the Edmunds-Tucker Act, the LDS Church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. Criticism of polygamy =Unhappiness associated with plural marriages= Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages often produced extreme unhappiness in some wives. LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book In Sacred Loneliness, described many instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy. Mormon apologists claim that many women were very satisfied with polygamous marriages, and note that individuals such as Zina Huntington‚Äîa polygamous wife of Brigham Young‚Äîwent on speaking tours as part of the suffrage movement touting the joys and benefits of plural marriage. Philip Stewart Robinson was a traveling journalist for the Telegraph of London. In his \\"Sinners and Saints\\", he notes \\"I had expected to see men with long whips, sitting on fences, swearing at their gangs of wives at work in the fields. I expected every now and then to hear of drunken saints beating seven or eight wives all at once,\\" but found no such thing. While continuing to disagree with the practice of polygamy, he found that > Utah-born girls, the offspring of plural wives, have figures that would make > Paris envious; and they carry themselves with almost oriental dignity. There > is nothing, so far as I have seen, in the manners of Salt Lake City to make > me suspect the existence of that licentiousness of which so much has been > written. He believed that the negative representations of Mormons came universally \\"[f]rom anti-Mormons only\\". =Plural marriage used to justify immoral behavior with young girls= Richard Abanes has claimed that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes. Mormon historian George D. Smith studied 153 men who took plural wives in the early years of Mormonism, and found that two of the girls were thirteen years old, 13 girls were fourteen years old, 21 were fifteen years old, and 53 were sixteen years old.George D. Smith, ‚ÄúNauvoo Polygamists\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Spring 1994, p. ix. LDS historian Todd Compton documented that Joseph Smith was sealed to two girls of age 14 and two girls of age 16. During the era of polygamy in Utah, the New York Times reported in 1857 cases of girls aged 10 and 11 being married to old men, and noting that marriages of girls aged 14 was \\"a very common occurrence\\". Historian Stanley Hirshson also noted these practices and cites the New York Times and several other sources as support. Brigham Young attempted to stamp out the practice of men being sealed to excessively young girls. In 1857, he stated, \\"I shall not seal the people as I have done. Old Father Alread brought three young girls 12 & 13 years old. I would not seal them to him. They would not be equally yoked together .... Many get their endowments who are not worthy and this is the way that devils are made.\\"Wilford Woodruff, Wilford Woodruff's Journal, 5:58. Bar chart showing age differences at the time of polygamous marriage between teenage brides and early Mormon church leaders. The average age of first marriage for white US women from 1850 to 1880 was 23. =Shortage of wives caused by plural marriage= Richard Abanes argues that polygamy may have caused a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): > Brethren, I want you to understand that it is not to be as it has been > heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out > the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the > ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking > any of them, and let us all have a fair shake., Mormon scholars dispute the accuracy of the quote, as it cannot be corroborated by a second source such as the extensive (though incomplete) record of sermons in the Journal of Discourses. FairWiki suggests that it may be a paraphrase of the following quoted statement, which is authentic: \\"You are sent out as shepherds to gather the sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep: they belong to Him that sends you. Then do not make a choice of any of those sheep; do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold.\\"Journal of Discourses; August 28, 1852; vol. 6, p. 256. Critics of Mormonism interpret this to be a statement of \\"selecting\\" converts for plural marriages. In the paragraph immediately following the above quote, Kimball went on to say: Mormon apologists dispute that there was a shortage of women, and advocate that polygamy was used at least in part to care for women who did not have husbands or were widows. LDS historians George L. Mitton and Rhett S. James of FARMS cite Brigham YoungSee as encouraging single men to marry, stating that the incidence of polygamy would thus be reduced.Journal of Discourses vol. 12, p194: Brigham Young stated, \\"let every man in the land over eighteen years of age take a wife, and then go to work with your hands and cultivate the earth, or labor at some mechanical business, or some honest trade to provide an honest living for yourselves and those who depend upon you for their subsistence; observing temperance, and loving truth and virtue; then would the women be cared for, be nourished, honored and blest, becoming honorable mothers of a race of men and women farther advanced in physical and mental perfection than their fathers. This would create a revolution in our country, and would produce results that would be of incalculable good. If they would do this, the Elders of this Church would not be under the necessity of taking so many wives.\\" The precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20‚Äì25 percent of adults in the church were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.Encyclopedia of Mormonism. MacMillan (1992) p. 1095. =Coercion and deception related to plural marriage= Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage; for example, the case of Joseph Smith warning some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife is often cited as an example. In 1893, married LDS Church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not married. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the U.S. Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law. Ann Eliza Young, nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother. However, LDS scholar Hugh Nibley disputed this claim, arguing that Ann Eliza and her mother had sought the marriage.Hugh W. Nibley, Sounding Brass, Part 4. link Mormon apologists claim that these were isolated cases, and the vast majority of wives consented willingly to plural marriage. =Incest= Critics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral. In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the marriage of John Bernhisel to his sister, Maria. In 1886, Abraham H. Cannon (an apostle at the time) claimed tha fellow apostle Lorenzo Snow stated that the day would come when brothers and sisters could get married in the Church, and that Brigham Young purportedly shared these views.Journal of Mormon History, 1992, p. 106. =Public opposition and anti-Mormon agitation= Opponents of the LDS Church found in polygamy a convenient cause c√©l√®bre. Opposition to the church, especially among former Mormons, frequently focused, not upon the drawbacks of polygamy as a marriage system, but upon polygamy as a symptom of the depravity of Mormonism and Mormons in general. Former LDS Church member and prominent critic Fanny Stenhouse wrote in 1875: > It would be quite impossible, with any regard to propriety, to relate all > the horrible results of this disgraceful system .... Marriages have been > contracted between the nearest of relatives; and old men tottering on the > brink of the grave have been united to little girls scarcely in their teens; > while unnatural alliances of every description, which in any other community > would be regarded with disgust and abhorrence, are here entered into in the > name of God. The end of polygamy in the LDS Church =1890 Manifesto= In April 1889, Wilford Woodruff, president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, \\"we mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it.\\"Salt Lake Herald, 1889-10-27, quoted in Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing. By September 1890, federal officials were preparing to seize the church's four temples and the U.S. Congress had debated whether to extend the 1882 Edmunds Act so that all Mormons would be disenfranchised, not just those practicing plural marriage. The Supreme Court had already ruled in Davis v. Beason. that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. Woodruff would later recount that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage.Remaraks of Wilford Woodruff at Cache Stake Conference, Logan, Utah, 1891-11-01; reported at Wilford Woodruff, \\"Remarks\\", Deseret Weekly (Salt Lake City, Utah) 1891-11-14; excerpts reprinted in LDS Church, \\"Official Declaration 1\\", Doctrine and Covenants. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned Deseret Weekly in Salt Lake City.Wilford Woodruff, \\"Official Declaration\\", Deseret Weekly (Salt Lake City) 41:476 (1890-09-25). On October 6, 1890, during the 60th Semiannual General Conference of the church, the Manifesto was formally accepted by the church membership. The Manifesto was the end of official church authorization for the creation of new plural marriages that violated local laws. It had no effect on the status of already existing plural marriages, and plural marriages continued to be performed in locations where it was believed to be legal. As Woodruff explained at the general conference where the Manifesto was accepted by the church, \\"[t]his Manifesto only refers to future marriages, and does not affect past conditions. I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor.\\"Diary entry of Marriner W. Merrill, 1890-10-06 (LDS Church archives), cited in Despite Woodruff's explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife.Lorenzo Snow, who would succeed Woodruff as president of the church, was one such leader. However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the Edmunds Act.Kenneth L. Cannon II, \\"Beyond the Manifesto: Polygamous Cohabitation among LDS General Authorities after 1890\\", Utah Historical Quarterly 46:24 (1978). =Aftermath: The Smoot Hearings, and the Second Manifesto= Building on a limited pardon issued in 1893 by Benjamin Harrison, on September 25, 1894 Grover Cleveland issued a general pardon (with one condition) to everyone still imprisoned for polygamy offenses. Within six years of the announcement of the 1890 Manifesto, Utah had become a state and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided. D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions.Numerous marriages also were performed in international waters on the high seas. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto officially ended the practice of plural marriage in the church, \\"on an exceptional basis, some new plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904\\". However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B. H. Roberts. Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and were examined in detail during a series of congressional hearings on whether the United States Senate should seat Mormon Apostle Reed Smoot, who was elected by the Utah legislature in 1903. The hearings began in 1904 and continued until 1907, when the Senate finally voted to seat him. During the hearings, Smoot was given a provisional seat on the Senate and was allowed to vote. Smoot's chief opponents in the Senate were Senators Fred Dubois of Idaho and Julius C. Burrows of Michigan, who heavily criticized the church for its practice of polygamy.Congressional Record, December 13, 1906 However, the opposition against Smoot was not universal among the senators with Senators such as Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania making sympathetic remarks on the issue. In response to the hearings, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a \\"Second Manifesto\\" in 1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into or solemnize new plural marriages. Polygamy was gradually discontinued after the 1904 manifesto as no new plural marriages were allowed and older polygamists eventually died, though, these polygamous LDS families cohabitated into the 1940s and 1950s. Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley each resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church's position on plural marriage.Victor W. Jorgensen and B. Carmon Hardy, \\"The Taylor-Cowley Affair and the Watershed of Mormon History\\", Utah Historical Quarterly 48:4 (1980). Involvement in or teaching plural marriage continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church.LDS Church (2006). Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics. (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) pp. 105‚Äì115. The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement. Fundamentalist reactions to the end of polygamy The shift in practice regarding polygamy by the LDS Church gave rise to several sects of Mormon fundamentalism, including the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and others. Polygamy in the 20th century Currently, the LDS Church does not sanction polygamy and considers practitioners to be apostate and worthy of membership removal. The church still confirms that polygamy may be approved by God, but that observation of the practice is currently prohibited by him. The Community of Christ does not, nor has ever adhered to the practice of polygamy. The FLDS Church and other Mormon fundamentalists still adhere to the commandment as practiced in the early days of the movement. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) does not practice polygamy, but recognizes it as a legitimate historical doctrine.

Boxes without analog passthrough only allow digital TV (ATSC standard) to be viewed on older, analog-only (NTSC standard) TVs. Those with analog passthrough allow both digital and analog television to be viewed on older TVs. Before digital television, passthrough originally existed for VCRs (and later PVRs and DVDRs), allowing the TV antenna or cable TV signal to pass through the VCR (with a slight insertion loss) to the TV set automatically when the VCR was turned off, or manually with a button on the remote control. Passthrough was turned off when the RF modulator (typically on TV channel 3 or 4 in North America) was on, as this F connector was originally the only way to send the VCR output to older TVs, until unmodulated composite video and RCA connectors became common. European VCRs did not turn off the passthrough when the unit was on ‚Äì instead, the VCR added its output as an extra channel (usually 38; it was possible to change the output channel, depending on the model, by turning a screw in the back of the VCR or by selecting an appropriate option in the OSD menu). The problem All digital-to-analog converter boxes have both an antenna input (which accepts the coaxial cable that formerly went directly to the TV) and an RF output (which now goes directly to the TV). They may also have additional outputs. Any converter box converts the digital signal for the current digital sub-channel to an analog signal (at the reduced screen resolution of the analog standard), outputs that signal onto analog channel 3 or 4 (set by the user to avoid any conflict with local over-the-air channels) and sends that signal to the analog tuner in the TV. With a box that lacks analog passthrough, no other signals are sent to the output, so all analog stations are lost. In the US, this primarily affects low-power and broadcast translator stations, as these are exempt from the FCC mandate to switch to digital broadcasting in 2009, as well as foreign signals that will remain in analog form. A small number of TV receivers were also manufactured with built-in broadcast radio receivers; these included some small portable devices or (more rarely) sets marketed for hotel/motel use. If used with DTV converter boxes, these will need analog passthrough in order not to block incoming FM radio signals.DTV.gov FAQ Workarounds There are several approaches used with converter boxes that lack analog passthrough: # Accept the missing analog channel reception. # Unplug the antenna from the converter box and plug it directly into the TV when watching analog TV. # Install a splitter so the antenna signal is sent to both the converter box and TV. Unfortunately, this approach will substantially reduce the signal strength which arrives at both the converter box and TV. # Install an amplified splitter in order to boost the signal strength before feeding it to converter and TV. # Install an A-B switch box to allow selection of whether the signal goes to the converter box (when watching digital TV) or directly to the TV (when watching analog TV). A-B boxes are seldom remote controlled, however. # Use two different TVs, one with a converter box for digital TV and one without for analog TV. # Use a splitter before the converter and a frequency-selective combiner (a VHF/UHF splitter/combiner where analog stations are UHF or a channel 3/4 \\"signal inserter\\" otherwise) to place converted signals on an unused channel. # Use a conventional all-female splitter before the converter and a reversed splitter before the television. For pass through, which allows analog TV and fm radio (if the TV also has a radio tuner), plug a standard coaxial patch cable between the two splitters. For dtv, unplug one end of the patch between the splitters, otherwise there will be a hideous signal loss. # For TVs with two coax antenna inputs, or one coax input and another type of composite video input which matches an output on the converter box, one can use two antennas, one going to the converter box and one going to the additional coax input on the TV, or to not require another antenna, a splitter to direct the antenna to both inputs. None of these solutions are ideal, however, requiring additional hardware (A-B boxes, splitters, or additional antennae or TVs) or manual intervention to change between digital and analog TV.Setting Up Your Digital-to-Analog Converter Box - FCC Consumer Facts The solution Some converter boxes offer analog passthrough, meaning that the same output cable which carries the converted digital signal (on analog channel 3 or 4) while the converter is operating also retains all remaining analog signals upon turning the converter box off. While this typically works to some extent with the converter box on, there is often significant signal strength reduction and/or interference on the original analog channels. Note that analog passthrough signals are only passed to the coax output, not to any other outputs provided by the unit. While other converter outputs may still be connected and used for digital TV reception, the coaxial RF output must remain connected to pass analog TV signals. For some VCRs (and, less often, TVs) this arrangement may cause a problem if the receiver uses the presence of active composite video or S-video connections to indicate that the signal should be accepted from those sources only. In such a case the two options would be to use the coax output exclusively, either when viewing analog TV only (which requires plugging and unplugging cables) or full-time (with the reduced digital TV quality produced using the coax output). The majority of TVs have a button on the unit and/or remote labeled something like \\"TV/VIDEO\\", \\"INPUT\\" or \\"AUX\\" which manually switches between coax and other sources, ensuring no problems when using both sets of connections simultaneously. United States implementation In the US, conversion to digital TV from analog was complete by June 12, 2009. There are exceptions, however: # Class A stations, low power stations (LPTV), and translator stations (Primarily local-only Television Stations, as well as TV Station Translator/Repeaters in rural communities) may continue to send analog signals until Tuesday, September 1, 2015.http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/DTVandLPTV.pdf # Cross-border stations, many of which are significantly viewed in the US,FCC list of significantly-viewed stations, including foreign signals will continue to broadcast in analog format until 2011 from Canada,Industry Canada DTV transition (in English) and 2021 from Mexico.Cofetel (M√©xico) digital transition calendar (in Spanish) Portions of Florida are also adjacent to Cuban stations or to ZNS-TV from The Bahamas. Many will want to continue to receive analog stations both before and beyond the February, 2009 transition date. In setting its requirements for coupon-eligible converter boxes (CECBs), the NTIA permits, but does not require, analog passthrough as an available feature. Unfortunately, only one of the initially available converter boxes included this feature, and a year before the original transition date of Feb. 17, 2009, Community Broadcasters Association president Ron Bruno said four of 32 NTIA-certified boxes had the feature. In late March 2008, the CBA filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction to halt the sale and distribution of DTV converter boxes, charging that their failure to include analog tuners or analog passthrough violates the All-Channel Receiver Act.Community Broadcasters Association petitions court to order DTV converter halt CBA maintained that the lack of analog support would seriously harm the LPTV and class A television stations the group represents, as it is cost-prohibitive for many or most of them to convert to digital transmissions,Tvnewsday - For Lptv, Dtv Is A Countdown To Disaster and the new boxes would prevent viewers from being able to watch (or even being aware of the existence of) their analog-only stations.KeepUsOn.com Responding to CBA's actions, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include the feature voluntarily in all converter boxes, and manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature. Some new DVD recorders and personal video recorders also provide both analog and digital tuners, and therefore could perform the basic functions of a set-top box in both modes. In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment,Court Denies CBA Petition on Analog Pass-Through effectively telling the association that it had not exhausted all its efforts, and that there was not enough merit to take the case to the courts. The CBA responded by concentrating its lobbying efforts on the FCC, and by urging more funding for low power and Class A broadcasters to transition to digital, asking Congress to increase the number of such stations eligible for funds.

Storbuk√•s (born 23 April 1943), more commonly known by his stage name, Sputnik, is a musician and truck driver from Bostrak in the village of T√∏rdal which is in the municipality of Drangedal, Telemark. His most well known songs are Skilles Johanne () og Lukk opp din hjerted√∏r Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In). In only a few years, Storbuk√•s sold more than one million cassettes, and set records in a series of places where he performed. He was rated as artist of the year in Norway in 1990, and in the fall of 1993 he got into the Guinness Book of World Records when he performed thirty-six times in locations from Mandal in the south to Troms√∏ in the north in only 72 hours. During Easter in 1990, he was in the Soviet Union and was a part of the most original music video that a Norwegian had ever made at the time. Under glasnost, Sputnik stood in Red Square in Moscow and sang Lukk opp din hjerted√∏r. The video was later shown in its entirety in Norwegian on Dagsrevyen. Sputnik stole the show during the opening of TV2 in Grieghallen in the fall of 1992, in a duet with Kjell Bekkelund. He has also performed in Sweden, Denmark, United States, Svalbard, Zanzibar, and Spain. However, most of all, he has performed hundreds of times in both big and small places around all of Norway. In the beginning, Sputnik received a harsh treatment from the critics, but he was loved by the people. Today, Sputnik is a living legend, and a symbol of popularity in Norway. There are books written about Sputnik, and he has been mentioned in Stortinget. Norway's Prime Minister has visited Sputnik at his home, and each year thousands of his fans come to visit him at home in Bostrak. As a bunch of artists have done, in the United States and other places abroad, Sputnik has given everyone that wishes the permission to see his large collection of silver, gold, diamond, and platinum records in his own Sputnik Museum.

Biography Ableman originally intended to become a photographer. However, in 1972 he joined an agrarian commune east of Ojai, California where he was to eventually manage of pear and apple orchards. After a time managing a nursery on the coast north of Santa Barbara, in 1981 Ableman took a job grafting orange trees at Fairview Gardens. When the previous manager left, Ableman remained, \\"farm-sitting,\\" until 2001. At its peak the farm served as an important community and education center and a national model for small-scale and urban agriculture, hosting as many as 5000 people per year for tours, classes, festivals, and apprenticeships. Under Ableman's leadership, the farm was saved from development and preserved under one of the earliest and most unusual active agricultural conservation easements of its type in the country. A frequent speaker at conferences throughout North America, Ableman gave a plenary presentation on the future of farming at the Bioneers conference in 2005.Collective Heritage Institute (2007) Bioneers 2005 Conference Catalogue. Retrieved 25 February 2009. Ableman lives with his family on an organic farm on Saltspring Island, British Columbia. Ableman now lives and farms at the historic 120-acre Foxglove Farm where he also directs the Center For Arts, Ecology, and Agriculture. Michael, along with Seann Dory co-founded North America's largest Urban Agriculture project, Sole Food Street Farms in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sole Food transforms vacant urban land into street farms that grow artisan quality fruits and vegetables and provides jobs to residents in the downtown Eastside of Vancouver who face for whatever reason challenges to employment. Michael Ableman and Seann Dory were brought together around a half-acre parking lot on Hastings and Hawks streets on the downtown east-side of Vancouver. Seann wanted to grow food and employ people from the neighborhood, Michael had the experience to make it happen. Together they forged a working relationship and ultimately developed a very ambitious plan to create urban production farms throughout Vancouver that would employ individuals working through the challenges of material poverty, addiction, and mental illness while generating large quantities of food. Foxglove Farm Foxglove Farm is a 120-acre organic farm on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia, Canada owned by Ableman.

Little Miss Tiny has also been published under the titles Madame Petite (French), Do√±a Menudita (Spanish), Unsere Dora D√§umling (German), Œó ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒ± Œ§ŒøœÉŒøŒ¥ŒøœçŒªŒ± (Greek), L√≠ngl√≥ng Xi«éojiƒõ (; Taiwan) and Bamtol Yang (; Korean). =Little Miss Trouble= Little Miss Trouble is the 6th book in the Little Miss series.

Little Miss Twins has also been published under the titles of Madame Double (French), SSangdung-i Yang (; Korean), ShuƒÅngbƒÅotƒÅi Xi«éojiƒõ (; Taiwan) and ŒüŒπ ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒµœÇ ŒîŒπŒ¥œÖŒºŒøœçŒªŒµœÇ (Greek). U =Little Miss Unbelievable= V =Little Miss Vain= Little Miss Vain is part of the Little Miss series. Little Miss Vain lives in Prettyville. Her beauty would make Little Miss Splendid jealous. Little Miss Vain has a blue body, a yellow nose, curly yellow hair, and pink cheeks. She wears silver shoes, gloves, a silver bow, and carries a matching handbag. Little Miss Vain has been published under the alternative titles of Madame Coquette (French) and Œó ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒ± ŒöŒøŒ∫Œ≠œÑŒ± (Greek). =Little Miss Valentine= Little Miss Valentine is part of the Little Miss series.

Before long, she and her friends realize that all they need is their friendship and love for each other (though a little chocolate never hurts!). Little Miss Valentine represents the holiday Valentine's Day. She has a red heart-shaped body, a blue nose, freckles, and red hair worn in braided pigtails with yellow bows. Little Miss Valentine is the only heart-shaped character aside from Little Miss Hug. =Little Miss Voyager= W =Little Miss Whoops= Little Miss Whoops is the 33rd book in the Little Miss series. Little Miss Whoops goes to visit her brother, Mr. Bump. Unfortunately, disasters happen. In the 2008 TV series The Mr. Men Show she keeps her pink nose but her hair is invisible, a pair of glasses and a pink bow replace her bandages, and her color is a lighter shade of blue; she is slightly less round. As her name suggests, her catchphrase for the show is \\"Whoops!\\". She also says that she doesn't like \\"flat food\\" and claims she's a \\"trained professional\\" at everything she does. While in the book, she is Mr. Bump's sister, it is never mentioned in the TV series (except on the Cartoon Network site and the Mr. Men Show magazine) although they are the same color and equally clumsy. Apparently, Miss Whoops is very near-sighted when she was seen without her glasses (explained well in the episode, \\"Eyeglasses\\"); even in the book, she squints. Their relationship was hinted at by the way they interacted (\\"Actually it's me, Mr. Bump\\"; \\"Mr. Bump, we make quite the team\\"); she really wanted Mr. Bump to celebrate her birthday in \\"Parties\\" and the Mr. Men Annual 2010. In the US broadcast she has a monotone New Jersey voice like Fran Drescher and in UK a Welsh accent. In the US and UK versions, she is voiced by Alicyn Packard (who also voiced Jibanyan) and Teresa Gallagher respectively. Little Miss Whoops has also been published under the alternative title of Madame Malchance (French) and Menina Disparate (Portuguese). =Little Miss Wise= Little Miss Wise is the 24th book in the Little Miss series. Little Miss Wise is always thinking. She is wise as an owl ‚Äì possibly, two owls. Being so wise and sensible means that Little Miss Wise brushes her teeth every day, makes her bed every day, tidies her house every day, and does lots of other wise and sensible things. If you are as wise as Little Miss Wise, you will know just what kind of other things she does; among them, Little Miss Wise goes for a walk every day. Little Miss Wise has been published under the alternative titles of Madame Sage (French), Œó ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒ± ŒúœÖŒ±ŒªœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ (Greek), Seulgi Yang (; Korean), and Zh√¨hu√¨ Xi«éojiƒõ (; Taiwan).

The prisoner may fund the bond himself; or he may borrow from friends or family; or he may obtain the services of a bondsman, in exchange for a fee. Part of the theory behind it is that those who are asked to put up the money or cosign the loan have an incentive to verify that the parolee does not represent an unacceptably high risk prior to helping with his release; and they have an incentive to help him stay out of trouble after his release. The prisoner has an incentive to be on good behavior during his incarceration in order to demonstrate he has reformed and thus would not be at high risk of violating parole. While on parole, the prisoner has an incentive not to violate the terms, lest the bond be forfeited, which would likely cause difficulties in obtaining the surety of family, friends, or bondsmen in the future. Parole bonds are sometimes used as a way of relieving overcrowded prisons.SB 441 Senate Bill - INTRODUCED It is based on the very similar concept of bail bonds; and just as with bail bonds, some statutes allow the bondsman to get back all or a portion of the bond by surrendering the prisoner to the authorities. This may require the use of bounty hunters to locate and capture him. Organizations like the National Association of Bail Insurance Companies and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a national bipartisan group of conservative legislators, have pressed the idea that financially secured postconviction release works far better than unsecured release.

Other Zimbabwean groups have denounced the poll as well (e.g. the Heads of the Christian Denominations in Zimbabwe.) African Union and SADC The South African Development Community (SADC) criticised the election in a statement on 29 June, saying that it \\"did not represent the will of the people of Zimbabwe\\" and that \\"the prevailing environment impinged on the credibility of the electoral process\\".\\"African body scorns Mugabe win\\", Al Jazeera, 30 June 2008.

An AU summit at Sharm el- Sheikh in Egypt began on 30 June, with Mugabe in attendance. Despite the international prominence of the situation in Zimbabwe and concern from the West, Zimbabwe was reportedly not mentioned in the summit's opening speeches. On 1 July, the AU summit passed a resolution calling for a \\"government of national unity\\" in Zimbabwe. The debate over the resolution saw the Vice- President of Botswana, Mompati Merafhe, criticise Mugabe and the \\"flawed election\\", saying that Zimbabwe should be suspended from AU and SADC meetings. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on 1 July that he would \\"spare no effort to work out a solution\\" and stressed that Zimbabweans needed to be able to vote without intimidation.\\"Zimbabwe rivals reject unity talks\\", Al Jazeera, 1 July 2008.

Tsvangirai, however, rejected dialogue, saying that violence and \\"persecution\\" must stop first.Cris Chinaka, \\"Peace first, Tsvangirai tells AU\\", Reuters (IOL), 2 July 2008. The AU summit made no resolutions stronger than its call for dialogue and a national unity government, declining to adopt tough measures against Zimbabwe. Mugabe returned to Zimbabwe on 4 July and was welcomed by a celebratory crowd of about 4,000 at the airport in Harare.\\"Supporters hail Mugabe on return from summit\\" , AFP, 4 July 2008. Having previously called for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the AU and SADC, on 4 July Botswana's Foreign Minister, Phandu Skelemani, said that his country did not recognise the election's outcome and hoped that the rest of SADC would likewise refuse recognition. Skelemani called for \\"expedited\\" mediation in Zimbabwe within \\"a defined time frame\\" that would be based on \\"mutual trust and good faith\\" and equal standing between the parties. Mugabe had said at the summit that he was saddened by Botswana's position, and Sekelemani said that he hoped Mugabe would not take Botswana's position personally.\\"Botswana urges region not to recognise Mugabe's re-election\\" , AFP, 4 July 2008. Mbeki met with Mugabe, as well as MDC faction leader Arthur Mutambara, in Zimbabwe on 5 July. On 6 July, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called on countries to \\"unite behind a tough, strong, clear Security Council resolution\\". This resolution, drafted by the United States, proposes that assets belonging to a number of leading political figures be frozen and that their ability to travel abroad be restricted. In addition, Miliband backed Tsvangirai's call for the appointment of an AU mediator, saying that \\"a clear mix of diplomacy and sanctions\\" was needed.\\"Britain backs UN resolution with sanctions on Mugabe\\", Reuters, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 6 July 2008.

China, and South Africa did not. Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, suggested that the proposed resolution could establish a dangerous precedent, while South Africa expressed concern that it could harm Mbeki's mediation efforts. Canada In the immediate aftermath of the second round, Canada imposed sanctions restricting the activities of individual Zimbabwean government figures inside Canada. On 5 September, Canadian Foreign Minister David Emerson announced more sanctions aimed at \\"isolating and maintaining pressure on key members of the Zimbabwe regime\\", including the freezing of any assets they held in Canada, as well as placing a ban on the export of arms from Canada to Zimbabwe. It also banned Zimbabwean aircraft from flying over or landing in Canada.\\"Canada imposes sanctions against Zimbabwe\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 5 September 2008.

Italy chose to recall its ambassador to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba reacted fiercely to Western condemnation, saying that Western critics could \\"go hang a thousand times\\".

On 10 July, the European Parliament voted for a motion calling on EU member states to impose increased sanctions on members of the Zimbabwean government; it also called on them to actively discourage the presence of European businesses in Zimbabwe. The motion said that the election was \\"not legitimate\\" and urged the suspension of Zimbabwe from African regional meetings.

The foreign ministers of the 27 EU member states agreed on 22 July to add 37 individuals to the list of individuals subject to EU sanctions; four companies were also added to the list. In a joint statement, the EU foreign ministers described the re-election of Mugabe as \\"illegitimate\\" and said that the new sanctions were directed \\"against those responsible for the campaign of violence that marked the elections\\"; they also said that additional action would follow if Mugabe remained in power. The foreign ministers also decided to further restrict Mugabe's ability to travel to EU countries; to travel there, he would need the approval of all EU member states, rather than a majority, as was previously the case.\\"Zimbabwe power-sharing talks begin, as EU slaps sanctions on Mugabe supporters\\", Reuters and the Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 22 July 2008.

Following a preliminary agreement between ZANU-PF and the MDC on 21 July, outlining a framework for negotiations, Miliband described the agreement as a \\"first step\\"; he called for an end to violence and the lifting of a ban on international non- governmental organisations operating in Zimbabwe, saying that these conditions were necessary in order for \\"resolution of the Zimbabwean crisis\\" to begin. G8 summit At a G8 summit in Hokkaid≈ç, the G8 leaders declared in a statement on 8 July that they considered Mugabe's leadership to be illegitimate and announced that they planned to \\"take further steps ... against those individuals responsible for the violence\\". They additionally urged the Zimbabwean government to co-operate with the opposition and called for a UN envoy to be appointed to assess the situation in Zimbabwe. According to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the G8 statement \\"made it clear that we would appoint a U.N. envoy and would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime which has blood on its hands.\\" However, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev was more cautious in his view of the statement's implications, saying that there were \\"as yet no concrete decisions on how the United Nations should act in this situation (and) whether it's necessary to make any special additional decisions\\". UN involvement in mediation is generally opposed by African governments, including that of South Africa.Peter Fabricius and Sapa- AFP, \\"G8 rejection of Mugabe 'racist'\\", Pretoria News (IOL), 9 July 2008. Responding to the G8 statement on 8 July, Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga accused the G8 leaders of trying to \\"undermine the African Union and President Mbeki's efforts because they are racist, because they think only white people think better\\", saying that this was \\"an insult to African leaders\\". Speaking in Johannesburg on 10 July, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that the election was not free and fair and expressed support for the appointment of another \\"high profile\\" mediator to work alongside Mbeki.\\"Zimbabwe opposition, gov't talk in South Africa\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 10 July 2008. United Nations Security Council The United Nations Security Council has officially met on the issue on several occasions. On 23 June the Council heard a statement about the deteriorating situation and the restrictions imposed on outside election observers. Then, following an off-the-record meeting, the Council issued a statement condemning \\"the campaign of violence against the political opposition\\" and expressing \\"its concern over the impact of the situation in Zimbabwe on the wider region.\\" After the election an attempt, supported by the United States and European countries, to have the Security Council declare the election illegitimate was blocked by South Africa, which argued that the Council was not in the business of certifying elections. The US ambassador, who was President of the Security Council for June, told reporters that the holding of elections was \\"a matter of deep regret\\". On 7 July the Security Council was briefed by the Deputy Secretary-General who said that observations \\"clearly indicate that the electoral process leading to the declared re-election of President Mugabe was seriously flawed. This profound crisis of legitimacy is further compounded by the paralysis of State institutions. There is currently no functioning parliament. Civil society has been silenced and intimidated. The economy is crippled, with annual inflation reaching 10.5 million per cent by the end of June and unemployment being over 80 per cent, and severe shortages of food and basic services exist. There is an urgent need to restore the rule of law and to start building public institutions.\\" The Zimbabwean mission to the UN said in a letter on 10 July that a proposed resolution drafted by the US would likely leave Zimbabwe in a lawless state like Somalia and cause a civil war if it was passed. According to the letter, Zimbabwe was not a threat to other countries and consequently there was no basis for the proposed resolution; the letter also alleged that the proposed resolution was actually intended as punishment for Zimbabwe's land reform, and it said that the US and the UK were \\"ignor[ing] real, entrenched, fundamental and enduring issues that lie at the heart of Zimbabwe's internal politics\\". Additionally, the letter blamed the violence on the MDC.Patrick Worsnip, \\"Zimbabwe says sanctions could start civil war\\", Reuters (International Herald Tribune), 10 July 2008. On 11 July, this draft resolution was brought to the Security Council to impose personal sanctions involving finances and travel against Mugabe and 13 of his top associates, appoint a UN mediator, and impose an arms embargo against Zimbabwe. The resolution was vetoed by the negative votes of Russia and China. Belgium, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Croatia, France, Italy, Panama, the United Kingdom, and the United States voted in favour of the resolution; China, Libya, Russia, South Africa, and Vietnam voted against it, while Indonesia abstained. The ambassador for Russia rejected the United Kingdom's interpretation of a recent statement at the G8 meeting that \\"We will take further steps, inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for violence\\" made any reference to actions in the Security Council. He added that such an attempt \\"to take the Council beyond its Charter prerogatives and beyond the maintenance of international peace and security... [was] illegitimate and dangerous.\\" The ambassador for China stressed the importance of discussion between the political parties in Zimbabwe and said that the resolution would \\"interfere with the negotiating process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation\\". South African Permanent Representative Dumisani Kumalo criticised the resolution for being biased in favour of the MDC and against ZANU-PF, and he urged the Security Council to give Mbeki's mediation a chance without potentially undermining it by imposing sanctions. He said that, even if sanctions were eventually deemed necessary, they should not be imposed immediately. US Permanent Representative Zalmay Khalilzad was sharply critical of the positions taken by Russia and South Africa. Describing Mugabe's government as a \\"horrible regime\\", he said that Mbeki's mediation efforts were a failure, that no \\"serious\\" negotiations were taking place, and that it appeared Mbeki was protecting Mugabe and sometimes even working with him. He criticised Russia for what he characterised as a reversal of its position, noting that Russia had backed the G8 statement a few days prior. Khalilzad also said that the US could have considered an arrangement in which sanctions would only be imposed after the passage of a certain length of time, if those opposed to the resolution had chosen to negotiate. The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly rejected the accusation that Russia had reversed its position. British Foreign Secretary Miliband was also critical of Russia's opposition, saying that it would \\"appear incomprehensible to the people of Zimbabwe\\".Nelson Banya, \\"Zimbabwe says sanctions failure a victory over racism\\", Reuters (International Herald Tribune), 12 July 2008. Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Security Council vote, and he thanked \\"those who helped defeat international racism disguised as multilateral action at the UN\\". According to Ndlovu, the outcome upheld \\"the principles of non- interference into the sovereign affairs of a UN member state\\". United States Immediately after the election, US President George W. Bush said on 28 June 2008 that the US would be imposing new sanctions on \\"this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it\\", and he called for an international arms embargo on Zimbabwe and the barring of travel by members of its government.Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Celia W. Dugger, \\"Zimbabwe Faces Wider Sanctions Under Bush Plan\\", The New York Times, 29 June 2008. Bush said on 15 July that he was unhappy with Russia and China's Security Council veto and that the US Departments of State and the Treasury were \\"working on potential US action\\". At a Senate hearing later on the same day, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer said that US sanctions were planned to target individuals as well as Zimbabwean government institutions, although she noted that European sanctions would be more effective because the Zimbabwean economy was more connected to Europe; she also criticised the Russian and Chinese veto, saying that it \\"enabled Mugabe\\". Also on 15 July, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that Mugabe's \\"tyranny\\" would cause \\"perennial instability\\" in southern Africa for as long as it existed.\\"Bush: US eying Zimbabwe sanctions\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 15 July 2008.

When Northern troops took over the city of New Orleans, Henry Blackmar moved the business to Augusta, while Armand‚Äîdue to his Northern accent‚Äîmanaged to continue working out of New Orleans for a time, but a Union raid on his business forced him to cease working. He continued to live in Louisiana and published songs of his own, under a pseudonym, through his brother. Blackmar's published work included, among others: The Bonnie Blue Flag; Dixie War Song (arranged and published); (State Song) Maryland! My Maryland!; Southern Marseillaise; and The Beauregard Manassas. Henry Blackmar continued to operate the Blackmar publishing house out of Augusta, Georgia, extending their distribution chain throughout the South. Following the Civil War, Armand continued to publish music and sell it in several sites in the United States. He returned to New Orleans and re- opened a music store there. His brother Henry operated a music store of his own that was also located in New Orleans. Armand died several years after returning to New Orleans. During the contentious Civil War years, Armand Edward also worked as a lawyer in New Orleans. In 1881 and 1882, A.E.

The club was founded 14 October 1925 by what was the reserve side of VfL 05 Heide. The reservists thought they were the better side and challenged the first team to a match, which they won. Despite this, no changes were made to the first team roster, so the reservists left to form SV. __TOC__ History =Small town on the big stage= The team is known popularly as kleiner HSV (en: Little HSV), a play on the name of better known Hamburger SV. They represented the smallest town competing in top-flight German competition in the regional Oberliga Nord (I) in 1956‚Äì57 and 1960‚Äì61 against the likes of larger clubs including Hamburger SV, Hannover 96, Werder Bremen, and FC St.Pauli. The club's appearances in the top flight were brief, but they were enthusiastically supported, regularly drawing large crowds. The highlight of Heider's 1956‚Äì57 season was a 2:0 victory over Hamburger SV before a crowd of 12,000, an attendance record that still stands to this day. In 1951, 1953, and 1955, Heider took part in the country's amateur championship with their best result coming as an advance to the semi-finals in 1955 where they were put out by Sportfreunde Siegen (1:3). The club also made failed attempts to return to Oberliga play in 1954, 1958, 1959, and 1962.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag =Post- Bundesliga= After the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's first fully profession league, in 1963, Heider became part of the Amateurliga Schleswig- Holstein (III) after failing to qualify for the new Regionalliga Nord (II). The team did eventually win its way to the Regionalliga for a single season turn in 1968‚Äì69, and again for a four-season stint in 1970‚Äì74. After slipping down through the Amateurliga, SV became a fixture in fourth-tier play in the Landesliga Schleswig-Holstein (1975‚Äì78), the Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein (1978‚Äì94), and the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (1994‚Äì2004), before finally falling to fifth-tier play in the Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein in 2004. Although generally a mid-table finisher, Heider continued to field competitive sides through the years, earning four second-place results, as well as a Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein (IV) title in 1982‚Äì83. The club has made occasional appearances in competition for the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), but has never advanced out of the opening round. After losing a promotion round playoff to Arminia Hannover in 1997, the club struggled, delivering poor performances, losing the support of its fans and sponsors, and facing financial problems. Their situation has since stabilized and they currently play as a lower table side in the Schleswig-Holstein-Liga (V), finishing 10th in the 2013‚Äì14 season.

He also scouted and worked in the front office. Young played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1971. He founded Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI), a youth baseball program aimed at increasing participation among African Americans in baseball. Career The Cincinnati Reds drafted Young in the 27th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. Rather than sign with the Reds, Young chose to enroll at Chapman College, where he played for the school's baseball team. He was drafted again in the first round, with the 16th overall selection, of the 1969 MLB draft by the Detroit Tigers, at which time he signed. He played two games in Major League Baseball at first base for the Detroit Tigers in 1971, going 2-for-4 with a double and a run batted in. After the 1974 season, the Tigers traded Young to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ike Brookens. Young rejoined the Tigers as a minor league instructor in 1978, and became a scout for the Tigers in 1979. He was named their director of scouting in 1981. He also scouted for the San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, and Florida Marlins. =Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities= While scouting, Young discovered that there were few African American players chosen in the 1986 MLB draft. After presenting his findings to Orioles' general manager Roland Hemond and MLB Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Ueberroth contacted Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, who agreed to fund a youth baseball program in Los Angeles, providing $50,000. Young also received funding from the Amateur Athletic Union. Young organized 12 teams consisting of 180 13- and 14-year-olds for Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) in 1989. He obtained help from African American players, including Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis, who are from Southern California. MLB assumed operation of the RBI program in 1991. Personal life Young was born in Los Angeles, and graduated from Mount Carmel High School. Young and his wife, Sheryl, had three children, Dorian, Jon and Tori. Young had diabetes, and was admitted into a Los Angeles-area hospital to amputate his leg on May 5, 2016. He died in the hospital on May 8.

Courtyard housing developed independently in many cultures around the world as a response to particular local needs and economical and social factors. The courtyard housing typology in the US developed in the Los Angeles area in the 1920s by several small scale developers in response to the region's climate and housing needs and which typically adopted a Mediterranean or Spanish Colonial architectural style. The courtyards would be quiet and shaded outdoor spaces that served as a transition between the street and the individual apartment units and were primarily aesthetic in nature and non-recreational space. In the years following, the typology was implemented across the United States until around the time of World War II when the automobile became more dominant to daily life and had more of an impact on the built environment when then-newer housing typologies were developed in response such as the dingbat. In recent years the Courtyard Housing typology has re-emerged following the publication of the book \\"Courtyard Housing in Los Angeles\\" by Roger Sherwood, James Tice and Stefanos Polyzoides as well as to suit a contemporary need for a housing typology with a density level between that of a single or double family house and that of a traditional higher-density apartment building. In 2007, the City of Portland Planning Bureau held a design competition for new designs based on the courtyard housing model for new infill housing in existing neighborhoods. While courtyards have been a part of buildings for millennia, courtyard housing in this sense does not refer merely to any housing structure with a courtyard.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers. Since his retirement as a player, Ellis has served as a coach and manager in college baseball and minor league baseball. He has also written screenplays and books. After a successful collegiate career for the Michigan State Spartans, the Brewers drafted Ellis in 1971 and brought him straight to the major leagues. He played for the Brewers during the 1971, 1974, and 1975 seasons. Over the course of his MLB playing career, Ellis played in a total of just 64 games spread out over three seasons, about half as an outfielder, with the rest as a third baseman and designated hitter. He played in the minor leagues until 1980. Playing career Ellis attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he starred in baseball and American football. Drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 1968, he did not sign, as he hoped for a team that would promote him to the major leagues quickly. Ellis then attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans baseball team. Ellis batted .380 as a sophomore and .431 as a junior. He set Spartans single-season records with 14 home runs, 60 hits, 13 doubles, and 123 total bases. Ellis was voted college player of the year in 1971 by The Sporting News. Ellis was named to the All-American squad that same year. The Washington Senators were expected to choose Ellis with the first overall selection in the June 1971 secondary draft.Gettysburg Times - Google News Archive Search Instead, the Senators chose pitcher Pete Broberg. After the Chicago Cubs selected Burt Hooton with the second pick, the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Ellis with the third selection.Herald-Journal - Google News Archive SearchHarlan Daily Enterprise - Google News Archive Search The Brewers immediately promoted him to the majors, bypassing minor league baseball.

They were the last such aircraft ever built, and in terms of their length and volume, the largest Zeppelins ever to fly. During the 1930s, airships like the Hindenburg class were widely considered the future of air travel, and the lead ship of the class, LZ 129 Hindenburg, established a regular transatlantic service. The destruction of this ship in a highly publicized accident was to prove the death knell for these expectations. The second ship, LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin, was never operated on a regular passenger service, and was scrapped in 1940 by order of Hermann G√∂ring.  Design and development  The Hindenburg class were built to an all-duralumin design. The leader of the design team was Dr. Ludwig D√ºrr, who had overseen the design of all Zeppelins except LZ-1 (on which he was a crew member), under the overall direction of Dr. Hugo Eckener, the head of the company. They were long and in diameter, longer than three Boeing 747s placed end-to-end, longer than four Goodyear GZ-20 \\"blimps\\" end-to-end, and only shorter than the . The previous largest civilian airship, with a length of and a width of , was the British R101, which was completed in 1929. The US Navy's Akron and Macon were long and wide. The design originally called for cabins for 50 passengers and a crew complement of 40. Construction of the first ship, LZ 129, later named Hindenburg, began in 1931, but was suddenly stopped when Luftschiffbau Zeppelin went bankrupt. This led Eckener to make a deal with the Nazi Party which came to power in 1933. He needed money to build the airship; in return he was forced to display the German flag on the fins. Construction resumed in 1935. The keel of the second ship, LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin was laid on June 23, 1936, and the cells were inflated with hydrogen on August 15, 1938. As the second Zeppelin to carry the name Graf Zeppelin (after the LZ 127), it is often referred to as Graf Zeppelin II. A fire-damaged duralumin cross brace from the frame of the Hindenburg salvaged in May 1937 from the crash site at NAS Lakehurst The duralumin frame was covered by cotton cloth varnished with iron oxide and cellulose acetate butyrate impregnated with aluminium powder. The aluminium was added to reflect both ultraviolet, which damaged the fabric, and infrared light, which caused heating of the gas. This was an innovation that was first used on the LZ 126 which was provided as war reparations to the US and served as the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3) from 1924 until decommissioned in 1933. The rigid structure was held together by many large rings up to the size of a Ferris wheel, 15 of which were gas cell boundaries which formed bulkheads. These bulkheads were braced by steel wires which connected up into the axial catwalk. The longitudinal duralumin girders connected all the rings together and formed \\"panels\\". The 16 gas cells were made of cotton and a gas- tight material. On Graf Zeppelin, the cells were lightened and one was made of lightweight silk instead of cotton. Hydrogen was vented out through valves on the top of the ship. These valves could be controlled both manually and automatically. The axial catwalk was added across the center of the ship to provide access to the gas valves. A keel catwalk provided access to the crew quarters and the engines. Alongside the keel were water ballast and fuel tanks. The tail fins of the airship were over in length, and were held together with a cross-like structure. The lower tail fin also had an auxiliary control room in case the controls in the gondola malfunctioned. Hindenburg was powered by four reversible Daimler-Benz diesel engines which gave the airship a maximum speed of . Although the Graf Zeppelin had the same engine car design in its early stages of construction, the pods were later completely redesigned to power tractor propellers. The engines had a water recovery system which captured the exhaust of the engines to minimize weight lost during flight. To reduce drag, the passenger rooms were contained entirely within the hull, rather than in the gondola as on the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, on two decks. The upper deck, \\"A\\", contained the passenger quarters, public areas, a dining room, a lounge, and a writing room. The lower deck, \\"B\\", contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passenger decks were redesigned for Graf Zeppelin; the restaurant was moved to the middle of the quarters and the promenade windows were half a panel lower. =Lift gas= Hindenburg was originally designed for helium, heavier than hydrogen but nonflammable. In the 1920s the United States possessed a monopoly on the production of helium, obtained as a byproduct of natural gas production. The US Congress banned its export under the Helium Act (1925) in an effort to conserve helium for use in US Navy airships. Eckener expected this ban to be lifted, but to save helium the design was modified to have double gas cells (an inner hydrogen cell protected by an outer helium cell).Moondance Films, Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause (2001), also known as Revealed... The Hindenburg Mystery (2002) The ban remained however, so the engineers used only hydrogen despite its extreme flammability.Botting 2001, pp. 249‚Äì251. It held of gas in 16 bags or cells with a useful lift of approximately . This provided a margin above the average gross weight of the ship with fuel, equipment, of mail and cargo, about 90 passengers and crew and their luggage. The Germans had extensive experience with hydrogen as a lifting gas. Accidental hydrogen fires had never occurred on civilian Zeppelins, so the switch from helium to hydrogen did not cause much concern. Hydrogen also increased lift by about 8%. After the Hindenburg disaster Eckener vowed to never use hydrogen again in a passenger airship. He planned to use helium for the second ship and went to Washington, D.C. to personally lobby President Roosevelt, who promised to supply the helium only for peaceful purposes. After the annexation of Austria in March 1938, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes refused to supply the gas, and the Graf Zeppelin II was also filled with hydrogen.  Operational history  =LZ 129 Hindenburg = Hindenburg made her first flight on 4 March 1936, but before commencing its intended role as a passenger liner, was put to use for propaganda purposes by the Nazi government. Together with LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, it spent four days dropping leaflets, playing music, and making radio broadcasts in the lead up to the March 29 plebiscite mandating Hitler's Chancellorship and remilitarization of the Rhineland. Commercial services commenced on 31 March 1936 with the first of seven round trips to Rio de Janeiro that Hindenburg was to make during her first passenger season. Together with ten round trips to New York City, Hindenburg covered that year with 2,798 passengers and 160 tons of freight and mail. Following refurbishment during the winter, Hindenburg set out on her first flight to North America for the 1937 season (she had already made one return trip to South America in 1937) on 3 May, bound for New York. This flight would end in tragedy with Hindenburg being utterly consumed by fire as it prepared to dock at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey. =LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II= By the time the Graf Zeppelin II was completed, it was obvious that the ship would never serve its intended purpose as a passenger liner; the lack of a supply of inert helium was one cause. The ship was christened and made her first flight on September 14, 1938, making a circuit from Friedrichshafen to M√ºnchen, Augsburg, Ulm, and back. The total distance covered was . The Graf Zeppelin II made a total of thirty flights, mainly spy missions for the Luftwaffe. = Scrapping = The bow of LZ 130 in the Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen In April 1940, Hermann G√∂ring issued the order to scrap both Graf Zeppelin's and the unfinished framework of LZ 131, since the metal was needed for the construction of airplanes. By April 27, work crews had finished cutting up the airships.

H√§yh√§nen surrendered information on Soviet espionage activities that solved the Hollow Nickel Case for the FBI, and led to the arrest of his KGB partner Rudolf Abel and other Soviet spies in the United States and Canada.  Early life  Reino H√§yh√§nen born on 14 May 1920 in the village of Kaskisaari in Saint Petersburg Governorate, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, into an Ingrian Finnish peasant family. H√§yh√§nen rose above his modest background to become an honor student and, in 1939, obtained the equivalent of a certificate to teach in high school, and in September was appointed to the faculty of a primary school in the village of Lipitsy. However, two months later, H√§yh√§nen was conscripted by the NKVD, the secret police of the Soviet Union, following the Soviet invasion of Finland starting the Winter War. H√§yh√§nen was assigned as an interpreter for an NKVD group due to his Finnish background and fluency in the Finnish language, and sent to the combat zone to translate captured Finnish documents and interrogate Finnish prisoners. At the end of the Winter War in March 1940, H√§yh√§nen was assigned to check the loyalty and reliability of workers in the occupied territory of Karelia, and to develop informants and sources of information in their midst. His primary objective was to identify pro-Finnish and pro-democratic elements among the intelligentsia. H√§yh√§nen became a respected expert in Finnish intelligence matters and in May 1943, was accepted into membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Following World War II, H√§yh√§nen rose to the rank of senior operative authorized representative of the Segozerski district section of the People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB) and, with headquarters in the village of Padany in the Karelian ASSR, set about the task of identifying dissident elements among the local citizens. In the summer of 1948, H√§yh√§nen was called to Moscow by the Ministry of State Security (MGB), the successor agency of the NKVD, where he met his wife, Akulina Pavlova. The Soviet intelligence service had a new assignment for H√§yh√§nen - one which would require him to sever relations with his family, to study the English language, and to receive special training in photographing documents, as well as to encode and decode messages. While his training continued, H√§yh√§nen worked as a mechanic in the city of Valga, Estonia. In the summer of 1949, H√§yh√§nen entered Finland via the Soviet naval base in Porkkala as Eugene Nicolai M√§ki, an American-born laborer, and would later be stationed in the United States.  Defection  H√§yh√§nen defected from the Soviet Union in Paris on the way back to Moscow after being recalled from the United States for good. In May 1957, H√§yh√§nen telephoned the United States Embassy in Paris and arrived at the Embassy for an interview. He said: \\"I'm an officer in the Soviet intelligence service. For the past five years, I have been operating in the United States. Now I need your help.\\" He had been ordered to return to Moscow, after five years in the United States, and now wanted to defect. = Hollow Nickel Case = H√§yh√§nen's defection allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to solve the Hollow Nickel Case, which had been opened in June 1953: the nickel contained microfilm with a series of numbers on it but the FBI had been unable to discover its provenance or decode the numbers. With H√§yh√§nen's help, the FBI was able to link the nickel to agents of the KGB, the successor agency of the MGB, including Mikhail Nikolaevich Svirin (a former United Nations employee) and Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (aka Rudolph Ivanovich Abel). The deciphered message in the nickel turned out to be worthless: a personal message to H√§yh√§nen from the KGB in Moscow welcoming him to the U.S. and instructing him on getting set up. However, H√§yh√§nen would give the FBI the information that it needed to crack the cipher, uncover the identity of his two main contacts in New York City (Svirin and Fisher), and a nearly identically-made Finnish 50 mark coin. In addition to Svirin and Fisher (code name \\"Mark\\"), H√§yh√§nen (code name \\"Vic\\") told the FBI about Vitali G. Pavlov, onetime Soviet embassy official in Ottawa, Canada; Aleksandr Mikhailovich Korotkov; and U.S. Army Sergeant, Roy Rhodes (code name \\"Quebec\\"), who had once worked in the garage of the U.S. embassy in Moscow. The KGB was able to get to Rhodes because it had \\"compromising materials\\" about him. H√§yh√§nen and Fisher were in the United States mainly looking for information on the United States atomic bomb project and U.S. Navy submarine information.\\"Artist in Brooklyn\\". - TIME. - August 19, 1957. - Retrieved: 2008-07-03\\"Pudgy Finger Points\\". - TIME. - October 28, 1957. - Retrieved: 2008-07-03 James B. Donovan, the lawyer of Rudolf Abel, referred to H√§yh√§nen as a \\"a professional liar, a pathological alcoholic, a bigamist, and a thief‚Äù during his defence in court. H√§yh√§nen avoided charges of espionage despite efforts from Donovan, and later lived in New Hampshire under the protection of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  Death  H√§yh√§nen died in an automobile accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike on 17 February 1961. The New York Journal-American and other newspapers published obituaries for H√§yh√§nen stating that he died in an accident in Pennsylvania, but author Phillip J. Bigger described the circumstances as \\"mysterious\\" in his book Negotiator: The Life and Career of James B. Donovan. H√§yh√§nen's death has been theorized to be an assassination committed by Soviet intelligence agencies.

History  = The Fire Within = Throw the Fight started out as a five-piece group in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band recorded several demos and an eponymous three song EP with lead vocalist Brandon Kyllo. Years later, Paul Kreuger replaced Brandon as the band's vocalist and, collaboratively, the group began writing and recording their next EP, The Fire Within. While still recording their EP, which consisted of four tracks, Throw the Fight was voted as one of the Top Ten Unsigned Bands in the country by Alternative Press in 2006. Shortly after, Throw the Fight signed with Cordless Recordings - a digital label that is part of the Warner Music Group. With the widespread attention provided by the article and after garnering a larger fanbase, the band collectively decided to begin touring in support of the newly recorded EP. After a year and a half of touring, a lineup change occurred as James Clark replaced Paul who provided vocals for the band. Though previously a fundamentally sound musical group, Throw the Fight believed James fit in perfectly with the band's overall style and his sound better reflected the desired tone of the band. The new front man provided a new sound for the band, one that attracted Minnesota producer Matt Kirkwold. = In Pursuit of Tomorrow = With moderate mainstream acclaim from the EP, Throw the Fight continued to write and record songs for their first album. Receiving mostly positive reviews, In Pursuit of Tomorrow carried musical range from intense, screaming guitar melodies to classic metal to melancholy tones. Throw the Fight, mainly concerned with their impression on their following, felt they had to stay true to their fan base with their first true album. Attributing their success mainly to a particular \\"X Factor\\" unseen in other acts, they have also admitted that unity and teamwork within the band have aided in their accomplishments. They are currently in the studio writing and tracking new material for their second album. = John Feldmann confirmed to produce the band's second album = Throw the Fight announced on April 11, 2011 that John Feldmann (Story of the Year, The Used, Atreyu) will be producing the band's second album. = Throw The Fight sign to Bullet Tooth Records / \\"What Doesn't Kill Us\\" = The band announced a new label partnership with Josh Grabelle and his label, Bullet Tooth Records, on March 26, 2012. The label will release their next album, \\"What Doesn't Kill Us,\\" on June 26, 2012. They released a B-side EP called The Vault in 2013. In 2015 after a brief hiatus they added three new members and recorded their follow up to What Doesn't Kill Us. It is set for a spring release through Bullet Tooth Records. =Release Of Transmissions Album (2016)= The band released their third full length \\"Transmissions\\" on April 8. Guitarist Brandt Jorgensen left the band shortly after the albums release. Bassist Kade Kastelitz also took on the role of becoming a second vocalist in the band. =James Clark departure= On October 3, 2019 the band announced that James Clark would be leaving the band on good terms to focus on Kill The Lights full time and Kade would be the front man going forward.

On June 7, 2009, group vocalist James Clark was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Several tour dates were canceled while he was undergoing treatment. He has since made a full recovery. Most recently, Throw the Fight supported their Bullet Tooth release, \\"What Doesn't Kill Us\\", by touring with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Nonpoint, 3 Years Hollow, and others. The band toured with Bullet for my Valentine, Black Veil Brides, and Stars in Stereo on the Monster Energy Outbreak Tour from September 25 through November 4, 2013.

The character was created by William J. Bell and debuted during the episode dated June 6, 1990. Tylo appeared as a regular continuously until 1994 when she took a hiatus for a few months before being written back into the series. In 1996, she left the serial after being cast on Melrose Place, where she was soon fired on the grounds of being pregnant, and returned shortly after. In 2002, Tylo and the show's executive producer Bradley Bell had mutually agreed that the character was played out, and Taylor was subsequently killed off, last appearing that October. Tylo returned in 2004, reprising Taylor as a ghost. She returned on a permanent basis in April 2005, with the character revealed to be alive. Tylo exited The Bold and the Beautiful again in July 2013, but returned for multiple guest appearances in 2014. She returned again from April 2018 to March 2019 on a recurring basis. Described as a world-renowned psychiatrist based in Los Angeles, Taylor was introduced to facilitate social issues and act as a romantic lead. In her early years, the character was characterized as being \\"pristine\\" and the \\"good girl\\" of the show. Most of her history has revolved around her relationship with love interest Ridge Forrester. Tylo emerged as a fan favorite in the 1990s, with Ridge and Taylor considered a soap opera supercouple. Taylor rivaled Brooke Logan for Ridge's affections, with a love triangle between the three becoming a focus on the soap opera for many years. The rivalry between Brooke and Taylor has received considerable fan attention and divided audience opinions. Ridge and Taylor were married twice, and had three children: a son Thomas, and twin daughters Phoebe (who died in 2008) and Steffy. After Taylor's apparent death in 2002, Ridge married Brooke. When Taylor returned in 2005, she and Ridge had a short-lived reunion before the end of their marriage. Upon her reintroduction, Tylo stated that the character became \\"more real\\", experiencing alcoholism and depression. In the years that ensued, she became involved with Ridge's brother Thorne after accidentally causing the death of his wife in a hit and run accident, and also had short-lived marriages to Nick Marone and Whip Jones. The character relocated to Paris after a brief relationship with Ridge's father Eric. Upon her return, she was revealed as Bill Spencer Jr.'s shooter. Storylines =1990‚Äì2002= Before her first appearance on the show, Taylor dated Storm Logan (Ethan Wayne) in high school. Her father is Jack Hamilton (Chris Robinson), and she has a younger brother, Zachary. Taylor's mother, Sharon, died when she was a child which led to Jack's gambling addiction. Her chaotic childhood led to Taylor becoming a psychiatrist. She was in an abusive relationship with Blake Hayes (Peter Brown) who also stalked her. Taylor begins counseling Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his wife Caroline Spencer Forrester (Joanna Johnson) when Caroline is diagnosed with leukemia. After Caroline's death, Ridge takes interest in Taylor, to the dismay of his ex Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Storm (Brian Patrick Clarke) and Taylor briefly date and he proposes to her at Christmas 1990 but she refuses. Ridge and Taylor begin a relationship which is temporarily broken up by Brooke; Ridge follows Taylor to St. Thomas Island and successfully wins her back. The couple marry in 1992; Taylor befriends Ridge's overprotective mother Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). In 1993 while trapped in a cabin at Big Bear and suffering from hypothermia, Taylor sleeps with her mentor from medical school James Warwick (Ian Buchanan) to prevent him from dying a virgin. A guilty Taylor writes Ridge a note confessing her infidelity, but she is presumed dead after a plane crash in April 1994. Stephanie destroys Taylor's letter, and Ridge eventually remarries Brooke. However, Taylor is revealed to be alive and suffering from amnesia. She was assaulted by drug dealers who took her place on the plane. She is rescued by Prince Omar Rashid (Kabir Bedi) and taken to his palace in Morocco. Omar holds Taylor captive when she regains her memories; she lives under the alias Princess Laila and is coerced into marrying Omar, effectively committing bigamy (the marriage was declared void). Taylor ultimately returns to California. She poses as a British nurse taking care of a temporarily blinded Ridge before revealing herself to family and friends in May 1995. Ridge and Taylor's marriage ends shortly afterward and he decides to remain with Brooke. In 1997, Taylor discovers that she is pregnant with Ridge's child. Mistakenly believing that he wants Brooke, she allows Ridge's half-brother Thorne Forrester (Winsor Harmon) to claim he is the father instead. After Taylor gives birth to Thomas Forrester in 1998, Ridge learns the truth and they remarry. In 1999, Taylor gives birth to twins Steffy and Phoebe Forrester, and suffers from tuberculosis during the pregnancy. Ridge's unstable high school ex Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton) becomes pregnant with his child in 2000, but the baby dies after Morgan falls off a balcony in Taylor's mansion. Morgan kidnaps Steffy during a family vacation and she is presumed dead. The truth is revealed and Morgan is jailed for her crimes, after kidnapping both Steffy and Taylor. In 2002, Taylor discovers that Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) who is criminally insane has broken out of jail. She tries to warn Eric, but instead is shot by Sheila while shielding Brooke. Taylor survives emergency surgery but dies in Ridge's arms due to heart failure. =2005‚Äì14= In 2005, Taylor re-appears at Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) and Nick Marone's (Jack Wagner) wedding ceremony and is soon revealed to be alive. She had been removed from the hospital by Prince Omar after her apparent death and was kept alive in a coma before waking up. Taylor learns that Ridge is now married to Brooke and they share a son together. Ridge cannot decide between the two women, but after Stephanie fakes a heart attack and convinces him to choose Taylor, they renew their vows. Stephanie's lie is revealed; Taylor and Ridge work on their marriage, but after she kisses Hector Ramirez (Lorenzo Lamas) and confesses her infidelity with James years ago to Ridge, they divorce. Taylor becomes an alcoholic and while driving one night to Phoebe who is stranded on PCH, she accidentally hits Thorne's wife Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) with her car. Darla dies from her injuries. Taylor bonds with Thorne and his daughter Aly, and they become involved. Taylor confesses the truth about Darla's accident and is sent to prison but is later released due to her death being accidental. Thorne and Taylor break off their engagement and she begins a relationship with sailor Nick Marone (Jack Wagner); they marry and she becomes pregnant with his child through in vitro fertilization. However after the birth of their son Jack Marone, it is revealed through a lab mix up that Brooke's eggs were implanted in Taylor. After overcoming alcoholism and depression again, Taylor starts a romantic relationship with Brooke's son Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder). She divorces Nick and decides to hand Jack over to Brooke. Taylor leaves Rick due to her feelings for Ridge. In late 2008, Phoebe (MacKenzie Mauzy) is killed in a car accident, where Rick had been driving. When Rick becomes involved with Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) in 2009, Ridge experiences anxiety and sleeps with Taylor after consuming pills. Ridge leaves Brooke and nearly marries Taylor, but returns to Brooke shortly after. In 2010, Taylor marries Whipple Jones III (Rick Hearst). That year, she purchases 25% of Forrester Creations worth $50 million, and when Steffy is fired by Ridge, Taylor signs over these shares to her daughter. In 2011, Whip and Taylor's marriage ends when he realizes she still loves Ridge. Stephanie and Thomas lie about Thomas sleeping with Brooke on an island they were stranded on. As a result, Ridge and Taylor get back together and make it to the altar, but Stephanie confesses the truth, and Ridge reunites with Brooke. Taylor later begins romancing Thorne again, and exerts her power as trustee of Forrester Creations. In 2012, Taylor counsels Brooke's sister Katie Logan Spencer (Heather Tom) who is suffering from postnatal depression. Taylor says goodbye to best friend Stephanie before she dies from lung cancer. In 2013, Thomas loses out on the top position at Forrester Creations to Rick and wants to leave town; Taylor persuades Eric Forrester (John McCook) to help Thomas. Soon, Taylor and Eric become romantically involved and she moves into the Forrester mansion. Taylor discovers that Brooke slept with Katie's husband Bill Spencer Jr. (Don Diamont) which resulted in a pregnancy (and miscarriage). Taylor reveals Brooke's secret at her birthday party in front of everyone, and abruptly leaves town afterward. In 2014, Taylor is now living Paris and has reunited with Thorne. The couple return to Los Angeles, but Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), now a teenager, heavily disapproves. Aly forgives Taylor for Darla's death and Taylor and Thorne return to Paris. After few months, Taylor returns to Los Angeles to visit some patients and tells Eric that she and Thorne broke up. Eric asks her to stay in Los Angeles, telling her that LA is the place where she has to live, but she refuses and returns to Paris. Before her leaving, Eric kisses Taylor on her cheek, still showing some feelings for her. = 2018‚Äì19 = In April 2018, Taylor returns to Los Angeles, where she confronts Bill for taking advantage of Steffy and accuses him of displaying predatory behaviors. During the confrontation, Taylor confesses to shooting Bill and once again pulls a gun on him in a fit of emotional distress. Bill agrees not to press charges against her for Steffy's sake, and Taylor remains in Los Angeles to seek psychiatric help off-screen. Liam, Hope, Brooke and Ridge soon learn that Taylor was Bill's shooter, with Brooke and Hope reluctantly agreeing to keep the secret. Taylor eventually moves in with Steffy and her granddaughter, Kelly. Casting Show creator William J. Bell introduced the role of psychiatrist Dr. Taylor Hamilton Hayes, played by actress Hunter Tylo, during the episode dated June 6, 1990. According to Variety, Bell created Taylor as \\"a romantic leading lady but also as a character who could facilitate social issues ‚Äî and directly partake in a few, too\\". Previously, Tylo was dismissed from two other soaps, All My Children and Days of Our Lives. The actress noted that her \\"crazy sense of humor\\" and \\"funny business\\" could have won her the role of Taylor, and she said: \\"After the audition, they told me I was the only one right for the role. I think they liked my 'a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do' attitude.\\" Sherilyn Wolter temporarily replaced Tylo in 1990. Tylo vacated the role in May 1994 to pursue other projects, but the soap opera left the door open for her to return, which she did months later. During her absence, the character was presumed to be dead. In March 1996, following Taylor's decreased airtime and rumors circulating of her exit, it was confirmed that the actress was to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after her contract expired that June, to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama Melrose Place. Taylor's final appearance was in May 1996. However, in July 1996, Tylo was controversially fired from Melrose Place on the grounds of being pregnant and was replaced by Lisa Rinna. In response, she sued that show's executive producer Aaron Spelling and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars, and won her case. It was immediately reported that she would return to The Bold and the Beautiful, with head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issuing the statement: \\"I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show.\\" In October 2001, reports surfaced that Tylo was to exit the series again following unsuccessful contract negotiations, although two months later in December she signed a new contract which gave her more flexibility to pursue other projects. In October 2002, Bradley Bell killed off the character and Tylo's last appearance was on October 30, 2002. In March 2004, she made a multiple-episode guest appearance as Taylor's ghost. Following this, she told Soaps in Depth that \\"I knew it my heart I would not be going back\\", stating that she wanted to \\"let the character go\\". During her time off the show, she had turned down offers to appear on other soaps including As the World Turns. In 2005, Deanna Barnert of Soap Opera Digest wrote that according to an industry insider, a character from the show \\"may come back from the world of the beyond\\", leading fans to speculate whether either Macy Alexander (Bobbie Eakes) or Taylor would be returning. Taylor was revealed to be alive, with Tylo returning on-screen during the April 25, 2005 episode. She was said to be \\"having fun surprising her castmates\\" with her reappearance on set. The show's producers wanted to keep her on-screen return a secret, with Tylo wearing a wig when travelling to the set, and the character's name being changed on scripts. In May 2013, Tylo announced online that she was exiting the soap, possibly for good. In a post on her website, she wrote: \\"For me, contract talks ended 4 weeks ago. I am moving forward and opening back up to the thousands of acting roles available, writing, and my skin care line. My friends and B&B; fans will be sorely missed.\\" Tylo's final appearance aired on her birthday: July 3, 2013. Dan Kroll of the website Soap Central was shocked by her exit, though felt that a future return was possible, judging from her previous departures. The news of Tylo's exit came just months after the high-profile departures of Ronn Moss and Susan Flannery from the series. Tylo has since returned to The Bold and the Beautiful for a number of guest appearances. She made a one-episode appearance which aired on February 28, 2014. The actress then made several guest appearances in April and May 2014, for a May sweeps story arc which revisited Taylor's accidental killing of Darla years earlier, with Darla's now teen daughter Aly (Ashlyn Pearce) struggling to deal with the issue of her mother's death. Tylo appeared again on November 5, 12 and 24 2014. Tylo made a surprise return to The Bold and the Beautiful during the final moments of the April 12, 2018, episode. Discussing her secret return to the set, she said: \\"It was just so out of the blue (...) They had me hidden away...I had a code name...They kept it quiet from everybody.\\" Character development =Characterization= A promotional still of Taylor during her first episode in 1990. Taylor is a globally renowned psychiatrist and works at the UCLA Medical Center. When she debuted, the character emerged as the \\"good girl\\" alongside other female characters, but still had a strong demeanor. Network Ten writes: \\"This Freudian Doc always seems to lose out to Brooke when it comes to matters of the heart. Taylor is as sophisticated and intelligent as they come, always able to analyze the problems of others, and sometimes even her own.\\" The writers wanted Taylor to retain a \\"pristine\\" and \\"well-mannered\\" personality, according to Tylo, to contrast her from rival Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) who was \\"feisty and reckless\\", the different facets which attracted Ridge to each of them. However, Tylo criticized a storyline in 2000 where Ridge is tricked into sleeping with his mentally unstable high school lover Morgan DeWitt (Sarah G. Buxton), who becomes pregnant with his child. She said: \\"I just wish that Taylor would get a clue, period! I wish that her psychiatric expertise would kick in already. I mean, she's retarded!\\", also observing that the character can be absentminded.Fairman, Michael (2000). Hunter Tylo (Taylor Hayes Forrester) ‚Äî Interview with SC Michael. Sony Pictures. In the years following Taylor's 2005 return, her storylines changed significantly. After Ridge leaves Taylor, she becomes depressed and struggles with alcoholism. Tylo explained how this affected the character: \\"The love of her life throws her away after she struggled so hard to come back to him. It was painful and humiliating. That made her more real and now, after everything she's been through, Taylor gets to be a little manipulative spiteful and even resentful.\\" Taylor, who is usually resilient, falls into a tailspin: accidentally killing Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) in a hit and run accident and lying about it, later being arrested for driving under the influence. Tylo confessed, \\"These were the kinds of stories I was begging for\\", as she thought \\"it was very believable\\". The actress also wanted to portray Taylor as less \\"serious\\". Taylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge. When asked in 2011 where she would like her storyline to go, Tylo said: \\"I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down.\\" In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally learning to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, \\"In psychology, they tell you to be true to yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much.\\" Between 2014 and 2018, the character was off-screen, said to be living in Paris, where Tylo felt that she was \\"declining\\", noting: \\"I think with all she‚Äôs been through, she would probably have no choice but to deteriorate.\\" Reflecting on Taylor being revealed as Bill Spencer Jr.'s (Don Diamont) shooter, Tylo loved \\"the idea of a crazy psychiatrist\\", \\"I‚Äôve always said that Taylor is the good doc who can‚Äôt take her medicine; that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always described her, and this story just gives her so many things to do.\\" =Relationships= Ridge Forrester Taylor and Ridge on their wedding day (1992). Taylor's major love interest is Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss). The couple faces challenges at first, such as interference from their respective exes, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Blake Hayes (Peter Brown), and Ridge's mother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), initially disliking Taylor. By July 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times wrote that Taylor was \\"hooked\\" by Ridge but was \\"no-nonsense\\". Taylor refuses to marry Ridge unless he was serious about the end of his relationship with Brooke; Goudas noted that Taylor wanted \\"insurance\\" and deemed her \\"upfront\\" approach as the \\"polar opposite\\" to that of Brooke. Ridge and Taylor ultimately marry in 1992. The actors were under pressure during the shooting of the wedding as it was filmed on the day of the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The love triangle between Taylor, Ridge and Brooke continued into Ridge and Taylor's first marriage. When Brooke has Ridge's child, Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones), Taylor helps raise the baby (although it was later revealed in 1996 that Bridget was fathered by Ridge's father Eric, not him). Speaking on Ridge's decision to remain married to Taylor, Tylo said that the actors were \\"so sick of this triangle\\" and revealed: \\"One of the things Bradley's going to do is have Ridge pick Taylor over Brooke. For a change, instead of women breaking couples up or getting pregnant to trap a man, we're going to see how couples work through their problems.\\" After Taylor is presumed dead in a plane crash in 1994 only to return months later, Tylo felt that Taylor would be feeling \\"quite cheated\\" by Ridge marrying Brooke, and joked that \\"Taylor wasn't even cold yet\\". Ridge and Taylor divorce, although soon become involved once more, and get back together when Ridge finds out that he fathered Taylor's son, Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory). Ridge and Taylor remarry on June 24, 1998. Despite Ridge and Taylor's remarriage, Brooke continues her attempts at winning Ridge back. Stephanie encourages Taylor to see Brooke's intent, with Tylo observing: \\"It was so obvious she was going after Ridge. How can you explain away that she always kept ending up in the elevator in her bra and underwear over and over again? Stephanie‚Äôs whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and [realize] that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does.\\" Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie (\\"Steffy\\") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting with a man who has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was \\"a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women\\". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the \\"horrible reality\\", saying: \\"He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of this woman who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with.\\" Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate. Taylor's \\"ghost\\" visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke. Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce. They have since reunited on several occasions but he continues going back to Brooke, despite Taylor's efforts to thwart this from happening. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens noted that Steffy and Thomas \\"grew up watching their daddy basically climb out of their mom's bed and right into the sack with Rick (Jacob Young) and Hope's (Kimberly Matula) mom, over and over again.\\" Other relationships Taylor has been romantically linked to Ridge's half-brother Thorne (Winsor Harmon) multiple times. They were briefly involved from 1997 to 1998, when Ridge is in jail and urges Taylor to forget about him. Taylor also briefly lies about Thorne being Thomas' father. After accidentally killing Thorne's wife Darla in 2006, Taylor falls in love with Thorne, who is \\"forgiving and loving\\" towards her, even helping her attend AA. They nearly marry, but split up due to his then 4-year- old daughter Alexandria Forrester learning that Taylor killed Darla. Of working with Tylo, Harmon said, \\"I am so comfortable with Hunter. We have that [comfort] around each other, and when that happens as an artist, you are allowed to open up more and there is more spontaneity.\\" Thorne and Taylor later become involved again in 2011, when they team up against the Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: \\"[Taylor] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to have a shot at Forrester in the driver‚Äôs seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge.\\" However, Tylo saw that there was a \\"sticky point\\" between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor \\"would do anything to make up for that\\". The actress said, \\"I think it‚Äôs very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn‚Äôt look forced.\\" In 2008, Taylor becomes involved with Brooke's son, the much younger Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), who was previously in a relationship with Phoebe. Lowder described playing the storyline as \\"challenging\\" and one that \\"stirs the pot\\". It began after Tylo and Lowder were tested for chemistry in scenes. When the news of Rick and Taylor becoming closer reaches Brooke and Ridge, they both protest against it; Tylo described this as \\"two pots calling the kettle black\\". Brooke accuses Taylor of being with Rick as a form of revenge against her, and enlists Phoebe's help in stopping the relationship. Tylo told Soap Opera Digest that Taylor's revenge is \\"a subconscious thing\\", explaining: \\"Taylor sort of feels like Brooke stole her child, so this is kind of retribution. Taylor is like, 'Well then I'll take your kid'.\\" Phoebe accepts Rick and Taylor being together, wanting both of them to be happy and giving Taylor the \\"green light she was looking for\\". Lowder believed that the tables were turning on Brooke, and said \\"now Brooke's son is in love with [Taylor], and she's in love with him ‚Äì and it's legit (...) Taylor wins, Brooke loses ‚Äì and Brooke's going crazy\\". Rick and Taylor get engaged but she ends the relationship due to her feelings for Ridge. Taylor becomes involved with Whipple \\"Whip\\" Jones III (Rick Hearst) through internet dating, in 2009. Tommy Garret of Canyon News said that Whip and Taylor's \\"chemistry is magnificent\\". Whip was previously involved with Brooke; Garret wrote: \\"Now he's in love with Brooke's mortal enemy Taylor Hayes Forrester... Hearst is magnificently suited for the role and fans want to see Whip and Taylor find happiness. At least for a few months.\\" Of their romance, Tylo said: \\"I think Taylor has found true love with Whip. I think if she was a smart psychiatrist, and able to apply her knowledge in her own world, she would be with Whip. She would know this is a healthy relationship. But Taylor doesn‚Äôt see it. She still wants to fix people.\\" Taylor and Whip marry in April 2010. Whip becomes jealous when Taylor admits to Stephanie that she still has feelings for Ridge. Whip's frustration with Taylor's feelings for Ridge leads to the demise of their relationship the following year, and they end the marriage. =Rivalry with Brooke, and Baby Jack= Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor would fight over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo revealed that she and Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: \\"We cannot look comfortable with each other. We need to look like we are in a place of competition.\\" In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were \\"crossing swords once again for the same man\\". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with \\"more intelligence\\" this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as \\"long as it wasn't over Ridge\\" again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: \\"I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'\\" The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the \\"feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'\\". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end. In 2010, Lang and Tylo recreated a 1983 lily pond cat-fight between Krystle Carrington and Alexis Colby in the drama Dynasty, shooting the scenes in a koi pond at the CBS Studios. Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said the \\"two Mrs. Ridge Forresters\\" had escalated to \\"all out war\\". After Stephanie's death, Taylor and Brooke's animosity against one another reignites as Taylor grows closer to Eric in 2013. Tylo said that \\"When Brooke and Taylor go at it, it really gets a lot of people wound up. I said this brings the show around full circle with everything Stephanie was fighting for, and now the battle has been set for these two to really go at it.\\" In 2018, Brooke and Taylor engage in a food fight at Hope Logan's (Annika Noelle) wedding to Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton), Steffy's ex-husband. Tylo stated, \\"In the past, Taylor‚Äôs tried to play into Brooke‚Äôs psychology to find any kind of guilty conscious (...) Now, Taylor realizes Brooke doesn‚Äôt have one! There‚Äôs no trying to get to her because she doesn‚Äôt listen to reason. Taylor‚Äôs been letting stuff sit and stew for years. She‚Äôs not happy and, now, she‚Äôs got to vent!\\" =2002 Departure= In October 2002, it was announced that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: \\"It is with great sadness I have to tell you that Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out.\\" The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: \\"I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere.\\" Tylo said that \\"It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not there was a woman after her husband\\" and that she was \\"done with it\\", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a \\"brick wall\\", but Bell was \\"afraid to go beyond that\\" and have the character go \\"off the deep end\\", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that \\"in reality that's what she needed ‚Äì to be more human. But she just got boring instead\\". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005. Reception After three years in the role, Tylo had become a fan favorite with viewers. Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune noted that she fit in well with the show's \\"signature glamor casting\\". Discussing Tylo's 1994 temporary exit, Kathleen Sloan of the Toronto Star observed that \\"fans of the soap couldn't have been more open- mouthed\\" over the matter. In 2004, Soaps In Depth called Taylor \\"daytime's sexiest shrink\\". Tommy Garret of Canyon News described Taylor as being the \\"epitome of grace and dignity\\". The character appeared on the Spartanburg Herald-Journal in an article titled \\"Stars with 9 Lives: Death is Not Forever in Soaps\\" after her airplane crash in 1994 resulted in her assumed death. Debashine Thangevelo of Independent Online observed, \\"Tylo is an actress who wields as much influence in the world of soaps as Taylor Hayes in The Bold and the Beautiful. Having inhabited this role for almost two decades, barring a sabbatical, she has made an indelible impression on viewers.\\" In 2008, Darren Lomas from Daytime Confidential wrote, \\"The back-from-death version of Taylor is a whole lot more horny than she was back in the day. Is it all because she never got over Ridge, her one true love?\\" Chris Eades of CBS Soaps In Depth noted that \\"Fans were absolutely stunned\\" by the \\"all-too-rare surprise\\" of Taylor's 2018 return, writing: \\"With Steffy in desperate need of support, it was the perfect time for Taylor to return to town and offer her daughter some help.\\" Reacting to Taylor being revealed as Bill's shooter, Canyon News wrote: \\"Tylo delivered some riveting scenes, as a mother concerned about her daughter‚Äôs well-being\\", stating that her return \\"causes all types of problems which make for interesting TV\\". For her portrayal of Taylor, Tylo was nominated for \\"Favorite Hottest Female Star\\" at the 1995 Soap Opera Digest Awards, however Kristina Wagner of General Hospital won. Tylo was nominated for the same award at the 1999 Soap Opera Digest Awards (Days Of Our Lives star Kristian Alfonso won that year). The actress received a Telvis Award for Foreign Female TV Performer (Finnish: Ulkomainen naisesiintyj√§) in 2002 for the role. Widely famed, the triangle was seen by Soap Opera Digest as one of the genre's greatest during the early 1990s. In 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times felt that \\"So far, Taylor has viewer sympathy\\" in the triangle, but also wrote: \\"we don't see Dr. Taylor Hayes do much practicing, or ever see her making hospital rounds. Air time means time with Ridge or with ex-husband Blake. So much for medicine.\\" Darren Lomas noted that the \\"Taylor and Brooke wars have lasted for two decades. Even when Taylor was taking a dirt nap, fan messageboards still buzzed with Taylor and Brooke fans taking swipes at each other.\\" Tommy Garrett recognized Brooke and Taylor the queen of soap opera cat-fights and noted that \\"at least half of the show's fans\\" had supported Taylor in the love triangle. Speaking of Brooke and Taylor's cake fight in 2018, Soaps.com writer Candace Young stated that \\"viewers were anticipating Taylor and Brooke‚Äôs wedding clash and they weren‚Äôt disappointed (...) A crazy catfight ensued which left no doubt that Katherine Kelly Lang and Hunter Tylo had fun taping the scenes. Loved it! It‚Äôs always re-energizing to see these two pick up with their rivalry and play off one another.\\" Ridge and Taylor are considered a soap opera supercouple and are referred to by the portmanteau \\"Tridge\\" on social media. Speaking on the beginning of the relationship, Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, \\"Taylor was Caroline's doctor, which made her affair with Ridge, as the bleep bleep machine was flatlining, slightly inappropriate. But then, nothing in daytime soap opera is ever appropriate.\\" Their 1992 wedding was ranked at number 18 by The Huffington Post on a list of the \\"Top 20 Most Memorable Soap Weddings of All Time\\". Michael Fairman referred to Taylor and Thorne as \\"the screwed-over couple of B&B;\\".

Glover attended Cornell University for his bachelor's degree, and he received his Master's and Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. Glover began his academic career at University of California, Berkeley, and he would go on to serve as an Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester from 1979-1982. Career =University of Florida= In 1982, Glover joined the faculty at the University of Florida. In 1987 he was promoted to full Professor, and served as Chairman of the Department of Mathematics from 1993-1998. Glover then served as the Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In 2001, he was named Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, and then was promoted in interim dean of College of Liberal Arts and Science in 2006, and he served in this capacity for the 2007-2008 academic year. Then in July 2008, Dr. Joseph Glover was appointed Provost of the University of Florida. In September 2010, Glover pitched an idea to the Florida Board of Governors to give incoming UF students the option of taking classes during the spring and summer terms only, bypassing the fall semester, to ease the strain on its crowded facilities. He described it as a \\"productive, efficient way to admit more students to a university for which there is high-demand\\". =Block Tuition= Glover is the leading proponent of an effort by the University of Florida to institute block tuition, in replacement of having students pay by credit hour. Under one proposal, students would be charged a flat-rate fee analogous to 15 credits for full- time undergraduate students regardless if they take 12, 15 or 18 credits. Charging market-rate tuition for distance-education graduate students is also a part of the plan. Glover believes block tuition is the \\"way it should be,\\" believing it would financially benefit students taking a heavy load of classes, cost slightly more for those taking fewer classes, could help increase UF‚Äôs graduation rate, and open up spots for students who might otherwise be turned away under enrollment limits. Glover made a statement saying \\"a student who spends more time here is taking up a spot that a student waiting in the wings is waiting to have.\\" Glover estimates that the switch will generate a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù revenue boost of about $4 million of extra recurring revenue, which would be reinvested in the form of adding sections to classes and hiring faculty to accommodate more students.

J. E. Raby, A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1934), vol. 1, p. 125. Life Nothing is known of Maximianus's life save what can be inferred from his poetry. In it, he claims Etruscan descent (me ‚Ä¶ Etruscae gentis alumnum [5.5]); describes his youth and manhood, including his friendship with Boethius,Thus leading most scholars to date his work roughly to the middle of the sixth century. whom he apostrophizes as the \\"greatest investigator of great matters\\" (magnarum scrutator maxime rerum [3.47]); and says that in his old age he was sent as an ambassador to the emperor's court at Constantinople (5.1‚Äì4). Some scholars, however, have maintained that the poetry represents the utterances of one or more personae and that nothing therein, including the name Maximianus, is to be taken as reliable information about the poet.For instance, Richard Webster in his edition The Elegies of Maximianus (Princeton: Princeton, 1900), pp. 7‚Äì11. Poetry Maximianus's poetry, usually divided into six separate elegies, deals with the contrast between the infirmities of age and the vigor and amours of youth. Some scholars have noted a connection with the topos of the senex amans found in classical comedy and in Ovid.E. S. Duckett, The Gateway to the Middle Ages: France and England (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1961), p. 63. The first, and longest, elegy presents in detail the miseries of the \\"prison\\", the \\"living death\\", that is old age. The second tells of the poet's long love for Lycoris, who abandoned him as he began to grow old; the third and fourth, of his youthful passions for Aquilina and Candida. The fifth recounts his abortive tryst with a Greek girl during his embassy in the East, along with her reaction to his impotence. (When he attempts to console her and apologize for his erotic failure, she sobs, \\"It is not that! It is the general chaos of the world.\\"Helen Waddell, The Wandering Scholars (London: Constable, 1932), p. 18.) The sixth, consisting of only twelve lines, again expresses the horror of approaching death. Throughout, \\"the imminence of death and the sadness of growing old are seen as representing the end of pagan culture and its joy in living\\".Gian Biagio Conte, Latin Literature: A History, trans. Joseph B. Solodow (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994), p. 717. Reception Despite its erotic content, Maximianus's verse was part of the corpus of texts used in the 11th and 12th centuries to teach schoolboys the rudiments of Latin,Winthrop Wetherbee, \\"From Late Antiquity to the Twelfth Century\\", The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism, Volume II: The Middle Ages, ed. Alastair Minnis and Ian Johnson (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2005), p. 122. though its use for this purpose was criticized by Alexander of Villedieu: > quamvis haec non sit doctrina satis generalis, > proderit ipsa tamen plus nugis Maximiani.Alexander of Villedieu, > Doctrinale, ed. Dietrich Reichling (Berlin, 1893), ll. 24‚Äì25. (Although this > [that is, Alexander's] instruction is not wholly sufficient, > it is more profitable than the trifles of Maximianus.) Perhaps because of this use of the poetry in elementary education, echoes of and references to it are found in a wide variety of medieval writers, including Hugh of Saint Victor, Giraldus Cambrensis, Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Nigel Wireker, Alain de Lille, and Walter of Ch√¢tillon.L. R. Lind, ed. and trans., Gabriele Zerbi, Gerontocomia: On the Care of the Aged, and Maximianus, Elegies on Old Age and Love, Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society 182 (Philadelphia: Amer. Philosophical Soc., 1988), pp. 313‚Äì14. A Middle English poem entitled \\"Le Regret de Maximian\\" was based on Maximianus's first elegy,Carleton Brown, ed., English Lyrics of the XIIIth Century (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1932), pp. 92‚Äì100. and Chaucer's use of the Latin poet's work has been investigated by various scholars.Beginning with an essay by George Lyman Kittredge, \\"Chaucer and Maximianus\\", American Journal of Philology 9 (1888), pp. 84‚Äì5. Later, Montaigne would quote the first elegy several times in his last essay, \\"On Experience\\".Montaigne, Essays (London: Penguin, 1978), pp. 369, 374. Although one or more printed editions of the work had appeared in the 15th century, it was the 1501 edition by the Neapolitan teenager Pomponius Gauricus that attracted the most attention among Renaissance scholars. Gauricus, suppressing the distich in which the name Maximianus appears and altering the reference to Boethius, published the verse as the work of the first-century-BC poet Cornelius Gallus, whose elegies had been thought to be entirely lost. This enthusiastic error (or deliberate fraud) caused Maximianus's poetry to be widely misattributed to Gallus for hundreds of years. Gauricus also appears responsible for the division of the verse, which in almost all the manuscripts appears as a continuous poem, into six elegies‚Äîa division that has been followed by subsequent editors.William Ramsay, \\"Maximianus\\", A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, ed. William Smith (Boston: Little, Brown, 1867), vol. 2, pp. 982‚Äì983.

Background The Battle of Waterberg on 11 August 1904 was the final battle of the Herero Wars in what was then German South West Africa. Following the defeat of the Herero force, the surviving Hereros fled into the Kalahari Desert under the leadership of Samuel Maharero. Of the estimated 4‚Äì6,000 Herero warriors, only 1,175 reached their destination of British Bechuanaland, the rest died of thirst, hunger, and diseases. Samuel Maharero gained British asylum at the Bechuanaland Protectorate and lived in exile at Tsau until 1907, and later in the Transvaal.

Since then, Herero Day is held annually as a gesture of resistance, unity and loyalty, as well as defiance against colonisation, particularly that by the Germans. Proceedings The main event of the 3-day gathering is a procession to several graves of Herero chiefs, followed by a church service. The men wear military-style phantasy uniforms, the women wear the traditional dress of the Herero, a voluminous skirt of many layers with a \\"horned hat\\", headgear consisting of two wide points. Heroes' Day On August 26, Namibia also celebrates Heroes' Day, a national holiday commemorating the Namibian War of Independence which began on 26 August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe. SWAPO and its People's Liberation Army deliberately chose the date of the first armed struggle to fall on the anniversary of Samuel Maharero's reburial, a symbol of nationalism and strength. The Herero Day assembly typically does not take place exactly on August 26 to give high- ranking government officials with Herero descent the opportunity to attend both events.

It is recognized by the United Nations as Namibia Day. Celebrated annually on 26 August, the day commemorates the Namibian War of Independence which began on 26 August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe. Origin In 1966 the United Nations General Assembly revoked South Africa's mandate to govern South West African territory and placed it under direct UN administration. South Africa refused to recognize this resolution. South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) at that time prepared for armed resistance and founded its armed wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in 1962. Many of its erstwhile commanders were in exile but PLAN began to infiltrate the north of Namibia to establish training camps. Omugulugwombashe was one such training camp, established in June 1966 by PLAN commander John Ya Otto Nankudhu. The group under Nankudhu had just started to build defensive structures1923 in Namibia KlausDierks.com and planned to train about 90 soldiers there. On 26 August 1966, eight helicopters of the South African Defence Force attacked the guerrilla fighters at Omugulugwombashe. At the time of attack there were only 17 soldiers in the camp. It was the first armed battle of the War. In commemoration of the day, 26 August is a public holiday in Namibia.

After his arrest, he was able to avoid a lengthy prison sentence by becoming a cooperating witness and proactive informant for the federal government. He was the author with Evan Wright of American Desperado. Early life Roberts was born in New York City, New Yorkhttp://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/jon-roberts-cracked- cowboy-6367635 to a Sicilian American father and non-Italian mother. His father Nat Riccobono had earlier moved with his brothers from Sicily and made a living through involvement with various shady businesses throughout New York in the late 1940s. Riccobono eventually became a made member in the La Cosa Nostra mafia. After being convicted of various crimes, Riccobono was kicked out of the United States and deported to Sicily. Roberts' uncles were also made members of the Gambino crime family. After being apprehended by police for kidnapping, Roberts was given an opportunity to expunge his record with military service. Roberts claims to have served with the 101st Airborne for four years in Vietnam, though no records could be found proving his military service. Upon returning to the United States from Vietnam, Roberts was an associate member/soldier in the Gambino family. Roberts self-confessed to committing extortion, assault, money laundering, racketeering in the early 1970's. Roberts fled New York City after being marked for death by the Gambino crime family for being allegedly involved in two murders. Roberts went to Miami even though all five New York Mafia families had a presence in Florida. Introduction to the Medell√≠n Cartel As demand for cocaine increased, Roberts found his Cuban suppliers unable to meet his demand. Through Roberts' girlfriend, he met Mickey Munday. Munday was a trafficker who introduced Roberts to Medell√≠n agent Rafael \\"Rafa\\" Cardona Salazar. At first, Munday was apprehensive of Roberts, who had driven up in a black Mercedes Benz, which Munday described as having \\"drug dealer written all over it\\". He also stated that Roberts' flashy car and flamboyant lifestyle made Roberts look like \\"someone I wanted nothing to do with\\". Nevertheless, Roberts and Munday began working under the supervision of Max Mermelstein, who had an agreement with Salazar to manage the transportation of cocaine from Colombia to Miami. He then oversaw the delivery of the loads to cartel safehouses in the Miami area. Roberts was able to increase his monthly cocaine business through this direct connection. Mermelstein and Munday established the routes for trips to Colombia, using boats, tow truck companies, safehouses, and airstrips, thereby setting up an effective transportation route for the cartel. Roberts claims to have made over $100 million USD dealing cocaine during this period. He spent $50 million of that money on his extravagant lifestyle. In the book American Desperado Roberts claims he had $150 million in a Panamanian bank, over $50 million invested in real estate and businesses, as well as several million in cash hidden in various safe houses and hiding spaces. Horses In American Desperado, Roberts describes: \\"After I made my first big score selling coke to Bernie Levine in California, Danny Mones told me racehorses were a good way to launder money.\\" He and Danny Mones \\"started Mephisto Stables in 1977\\". In Chapter 62 of the book, Roberts recounts a variety of processes by which he used horses to launder money. Additionally, \\"[He] also learned how to fix races. There were many tricks.\\" Also in chapter 62, Roberts describes another benefit to horses: \\"Dealing cocaine had promoted me into high society. Owning racehorses took me into the stratosphere.\\" He recounts prominent people he met through his racehorse connections, such as \\"Judge Joe Johnson, who hosted horse auctions\\", and through him, \\"We got friendly with Cliff Perlman, who owned Caesar's Palace. When I'd go to Caesar's and get comped, everybody assumed it was because of my Mafia connections. No, I was connected to Caesar's Palace by a Kentucky judge.\\" Through the same circle, \\"We ended up becoming friends with Al Tannenbaum and his girlfriend, Gloria. Al was a guy who'd made it big in stereos.\\" He describes a particular horse in the epigraph to his book: :Desperado, the horse that I thought would win the Derby and make me famous as something more than a gangster, was a baby when I got him. He hadn't been trained how to run, but he could already fly on the grass. He had good instincts. He didn't like other horses. You don't want a sociable horse. They stay in the pack. You want a horse who likes to run in front of all the other horses. Desperado was a killer. I named him Desperado because I saw myself in his eyes. Roberts also describes an honest jockey he had hired, and that jockey's demise: :At Calder, I had a jockey named Nick Navarro who worked for me. He was one of the good guys. He wouldn't hold horses or charge them or run them on dope. He was very skilled, and when I ran my horses clean, I used Nick. :One day in 1977 [sic] he ran a race for me at Calder. I walked up to him after he finished. He put his hand up to wave, and there was a powerful explosion. A bolt of lightning came out of the sky and hit him. Multiple news outlet reports support Jon's recollection, except they fix the date one year later. As they document: on December 28, 1978, jockey Niconar \\"Nick\\" Navarro was killed by a direct lightning strike after completing the second race at Calder Race Course. The remaining eight races at the track that day were cancelled. Downfall Mermelstein acted as a high-level trafficker working under cartel member Salazar and with the Munday transportation group. He was apprehended in 1985 by Miami Police as a multi-kilo dealer. Mermelstein was implicated by a California trafficker who gave information to the DEA in return for a lighter sentence; this trafficker was busted along with John DeLorean during a 25-kilo cocaine sting. Mermelstein then turned state's witness against the Medell√≠n Cartel and supplied information that led to the dismemberment of the Medell√≠n Cartel in Miami. On the morning of September 20, 1986, a little over a year after Mermelstein's arrest, the DEA (in conjunction with local and federal authorities) raided sites across Florida used to store and transport cocaine by Munday and Roberts. added 8/30/2020 source: cocaine cowboys reloaded: Roberts was arrested, to get reduced crime sentence he tricked the fbi into cooperation of turning Micky Munday in by talking to Mundays brother, at the end of the sting operation they gave him a dummy Micky Munday, 3 days before Jon Roberts trial, he fled to Colombia, during his 2nd week in Colombia, his friends farm that he was staying in was raided by Colombian government officials and evaded capture/death, repeating the same sequence for weeks to come, he fled to mexico because the Colombian narco war was taking over, he was then captured in mexico after living there for a while because a MOST WANTED poster appeared of him, he served a 14-year sentence, and was released in October 2000. Munday evaded arrest during the multi-site DEA raid, went on the run, and was a fugitive living in Colombia and other parts of the world for about six years. He was apprehended by U.S. Marshals in 1992 and became a cooperating witness and proactive informant for the federal government. Munday was released from prison in December 1999. Later years and death According to his ex-wife and various other sources, Roberts used his past to gain trust within the criminal community and report their activities to the authorities in order to maintain his prison-free status. Others have also accused Roberts of being a confidential informant; one of the Fort Lauderdale police officers who arrested him in 1997 for stalking an ex- girlfriend, possession of a firearm, and resisting arrest with violence testified he \\"found out later he's been a snitch or something. He was a CI [confidential informant] for somebody.\\" In a 2009 Miami New Times article, Roberts' lifestyle when he lived in Hollywood, Florida, was described as follows: In 2011, Garcia-Roberts interviewed Roberts' American Desperado co- author Evan Wright for a Miami New Times article (coincidentally dated one month before Roberts' death). In the article, titled \\"American Desperado: Co- Author Evan Wright on Coke Cowboy Jon Roberts' Memoir\\", the two authors discuss the book as well as their impressions and experiences when interviewing Roberts. For example, they share that Roberts was not completely reformed in his later days: Roberts died of colorectal cancer on 28 December 2011, aged 63.Garcia-Roberts, Gus. \\"Jon Roberts, Smuggler in Cocaine Cowboys, Dies\\", Miami New Times, Miami, 29 December 2011.

The primary objective of this operation was to clear a land route to the government-held Jaffna peninsula (which had no land supply routes) through territory held by the LTTE (or Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers), by linking the government-held towns of Vavuniya and Kilinochchi. At the time it was the largest military operation undertaken by the Sri Lankan military. Initially, the Sri Lankan military experienced success by forcing the LTTE out of Killinochchi, capturing large areas, however the LTTE managed to launch an effective counter-attack which reversed some gains made by the government forces. After failing to achieve the original objective, the government called off the operation. Background Following Operation Riviresa in 1995, the Sri Lankan military gained control over the Jaffna peninsula. The LTTE withdrew to the jungles of the Wanni from where in 1996 they launched an attack on the isolated Sri Lanka Army (SLA) garrison in Mullaitivu. After the Battle of Mullaitivu the LTTE gained control over the Mullaitivu district, since the government did not re-establish a base due to the lack of a land supply route to it. Instead, at the request of the deputy minister of defence, Gen. Anurudha Ratwatte, the military forces began to plan a large-scale operation to open a land route to Jaffna. The battle The operation launched on 13 May 1997, with the 53rd Division spearheading the offensive along with the 21st, 54th, 55th and 56th Divisions. It was preceded by a massive artillery and aerial bombardment, with the SLA breaking out of their fortifications at Vavuniya and Manal Aru and pushing into LTTE- controlled Vanni. The stated objective of the operation was to capture the A9 Highway, running from Vavuniya to the Jaffna peninsula, thereby allowing the establishment of a main supply route (MSR) to the SLA's isolated Jaffna garrison. It was also meant to engage and draw the LTTE out of its secure jungle bases. The Tigers could then be crippled, if not destroyed, by the SLA's superior firepower. The SLA wanted to diminish the strength of the LTTE by the end of the year so that it had to fight only a low-intensity guerrilla war. The operation was very ambitious from the start, requiring large numbers of troops for both offensive operations and the defense of the captured territory. As a result, units of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Air Force were deployed for ground operations in support of the SLA. The LTTE also staged a number of counterattacks against SLA positions throughout the campaign. One was during June 1997, when the Tigers launched attacks on the SLA-held towns of Thandikulam and Omanthai. A pro-LTTE website claimed that the attacks left 700 SLA soldiers dead and some 1,500 wounded in contrast to only 165 dead rebels. In addition, the SLA garrison at Mannakulam was also attacked on 4 December 1997; 146 SLA soldiers were killed in the fighting along with an unknown number of LTTE.World News Briefs; A Setback for Sri Lanka In Fight With Separatists ‚Äì New York Times The operation nevertheless did not manage to accomplish over half of its objectives. By mid-May 1998 it had completely stalled. The LTTE didn't show any resistance initially, but at Puliyankulam, LTTE troops led by Brig. Theepan showed huge resistance and blocked the Army at Puliyankulam for more than 4 months. LTTE cadres penetrated SLA lines and sabotaged a major staging area, destroying vast quantities of supplies and killing dozens of troops. Puliyankulam was meant to be the linking-up point for the twin prongs of the SLA assault. However, the LTTE had built effective defenses at the village and after three months of heavy fighting the SLA had to withdraw after suffering hundreds of casualties and dozens of tanks destroyed. The LTTE cadres at Puliyankulam had irrevocably delayed the SLA's advance and the operation could no longer be completed on time. With stiff resistance in place, the Army bypassed Puliyankulam and maneuvered through jungles and reached another village called Kanagarayankulam, hoping to out maneuver the LTTE cadres, but the LTTE managed to hold off the Army's advance. Unable to break LTTE defense lines, the SLA decided to open the battle on multiple fronts. As the fight continued, defense lines become very long, stretching from Nay-Aaru all the way to Mannar. The fighting would continue on for several months but the critical A9 highway (between Mankulam and Kilinochchi) remained in the LTTE‚Äôs occcupation. In 1998, the SLA moved some of its forces from Killinochchi towards the south, leaving the entire district vulnerable. On September 1998, the LTTE launched its \\"Operation Unceasing Waves II\\", resulting in the capture of the entire Kilinochchi district. Brutal fighting continued on the A9 highway. LTTE admitted to losing some 1,300 fighters during the course of actions. Aftermath Operation Jayasikurui ended after 19 months in 1999 when it was called off by then President Chandrika Kumaratunga. The operation had failed to achieve its objective of gaining a land route to Jaffna, but had acquired the towns of Mannakulam, Omanthai and Nedunkerni. However, in the process several areas, including the town of Kilinochchi, were lost to the LTTE, which also claimed to have captured a 122mm artillery piece (bringing its total to five), 81mm and 60mm mortars, machine guns, RPG launchers and assault rifles. The human cost of the operation was high, with both sides sustaining heavy casualties. The government admitted to losing around 1,350 soldiers since the start of the operation, although some independent western analysts thought that the figure could be as many as 3,000. The SLA claimed to have killed 3,614 LTTE fighters and wounded 1,899 during the operation.

A Month of Hungry Ghosts is directed by Singapore-based American film director Tony Kern and co-produced by Genevieve Woo, a Singaporean television news anchor and producer with Channel NewsAsia, and Tony Kern. The film was released locally in Singapore on 7 August 2008. The film is distributed by Golden Village Pictures, and premiered at Golden Village VivoCity, Golden Village Plaza and Sinema Old School. Plot In parts of Asia each year, during the seventh lunar month, it is believed that the gates of Hell are opened and all the souls are set free to wander the Earth. At this time, many spirits roam around trying to fulfill their past needs, wants and desires. These are the \\"hungry ghosts\\". Numerous religious rituals and folk performances, like street operas, take place during the seventh lunar month to try to appease the spirits. This film captures the seventh-lunar-month rituals in Singapore, a world-class centre of business and culture inhabited by many different immigrants from other Asian countries. While the hungry-ghost rituals originated in China and are still practised throughout South-east Asia in various forms, they are slowly dying out in many countries or may only be performed for several days of the month. Singapore is unique in that the rituals are brought to life throughout the entire seventh lunar month. At the same time, the immigrants in Singapore have brought their own native rituals to the small island nation where the hungry-ghost month still thrives. A Month of Hungry Ghosts captures these rituals and performances throughout an entire seventh lunar month in Singapore. Production Work on the film began in August 2005. =Music= Taiwan-based artist MoShang blends recorded sound samples from the streets of Asia with downtempo electronica for a unique sound.

The species is endemic to North America. Geographic range A. mutica is native to North America. It is distributed throughout the central and southcentral United States as its geographic range extends from western Pennsylvania to New Mexico and south to the Florida panhandle. Smooth softshells turtles inhabit the Mississippi River drainage from Louisiana up to North Dakota and Pennsylvania, as well as the Colorado, Brazos, Sabine, and Pearl, Alabama and Escambia river systems. Two subspecies of A. mutica have been identified. The midland smooth softshell, Apalone mutica mutica, is found throughout the central United States. The other subspecies, Apalone mutica calvata, is found ranging from Louisiana to the panhandle of Florida. Habitat Both subspecies of A. mutica are typically found in medium to large unpolluted rivers with moderate to fast currents, but are also found in standing water bodies like lakes, ponds and marshes. They prefer water with sand or mud bottoms, without rocky areas or dense vegetation. Sandbanks must also be present. Description The smooth softshell turtle has an anapsid skull. This kind of skull is present among the earliest reptiles and is retained by turtles today. The anapsid skull lacks openings behind the orbits.Downs and Grinnell (2017). Vertebrate Zoology Biology 242 Laboratory Instructions. The smooth softshell turtle has a smooth, flexible and leather like carapace that is covered by skin instead of the hard scutes commonly observed in other turtle species.http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&selectedElement;=ARAAG01020 The plastron is light (white or gray) with no markings, and the underlying bones are visible. Smooth softshell turtles have a tubular snout with round nostrils.Ernst C, Lovich J (2009). Turtles of the United States and Canada. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Sexual dimorphism There is sexual dimorphism between females and males of A. mutica as females are larger than males. A female has a carapace length of compared to a carapace length of for males. Additionally, the female smooth softshell turtle is usually brown or olive-colored with irregular dark brown blotches, while the carapace of males and juveniles is a brown or grayish color with dark dots or dashes. Sexual dimorphism is also apparent in the size of the tails and claws. Males have thicker tails than females, but females have longer hind claws than males. Similar species Smooth softshell turtles may be easily confused with the spiny softshell turtle (Apalone spinifera), as the differences between the two species are subtle. Spiny softshell turtles have a rough carapace with spines along the front edge while, as the name implies, smooth softshell turtles lack such spines.Oldfield B, Moriarty JJ (1994). Amphibians and Reptiles Native to Minnesota. Minneapolis, Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press. 237 pp. Additionally, the white chin and throat of the smooth softshell are unmarked, compared to the splotchy chin and throat of the spiny softshell. A. mutica is the only species of North American softshell with round nostrils; all other species have ridges on the nasal septum which make the nostrils C-shaped.Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT (2016). Peterson Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Fourth Edition. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. xiv + 494 pp. . (Apolone mutica, p. 231 + Plates 20, 22 + Figure 85 on p. 186). Diet Smooth softshell turtles are mostly carnivorous, eating aquatic insects, crayfish, fish and amphibians.\\"Apalone mutica mutica \\". Ohio Department of Natural Resources. ohiodnr.gov Although primarily carnivorous, they sometimes resort to eating vegetation such as algae, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Reproduction Breeding of the smooth softshell turtle occurs from April to June. The mating system utilized by these turtles is polygyny, meaning that males will mate with more than one female. Males actively seek out females by approaching other adults. If the other party is male or a non- receptive female, aggression may be displayed. However, if the other party is a receptive female, she remains passive to the advancements of the males. Copulation usually occurs in deep pools as the male mounts the female. The nesting period is usually from May to July as females only lay eggs once a year. During this period, adult females of A. mutica lay clutches of 3 to 28 eggs not more than from water in sandy areas.DNr.wi.gov Eggs generally hatch 8 to 12 weeks later with the highest frequency of hatching being between August and September. Hatchlings average a weight of and have a carapace length of . Male smooth softshell turtles become sexually mature during their fourth year and females become sexually mature during their ninth year. Female turtles offer prenatal care for their offspring. They produce high levels of non-polar lipids that provide energy for their growing embryos.Nagle, Roy D., et al. (2003). \\"Parental investment, embryo growth, and hatchling lipid reserves in softshell turtles (Apalone mutica) from Arkansas.\\" Herpetologica 59 (2): 145-154. This energy is more than enough to keep the embryos alive. The high concentration of lipids also offer an advantage at birth as it acts as a food source until they hatchlings become mature enough to commence feeding. This type of care is also known as parental investment in embryogenesis. However, after hatching no physical parental care is given. Life history Smooth softshell turtles are the most aquatic of the softshell turtles as they are often referred to as \\"swimmers\\". They are able to stay underwater for extended periods of time due to their long neck and their snout. They often bury themselves in the sand substrate at the bottom of the river or pool just deep enough so that their snout barely reaches the surface. Additionally, the skin covering the shell allows for a high rate of gas exchange. This enables the turtles to stay submerged for a long period of time. In this position, they often wait for prey to pass and utilize their long neck to capture their prey. These turtles hibernate in the months of October to March. They hibernate by burying themselves in substrate underwater. After emerging from hibernation, these turtles are often found on land basking in the sun. Given that their shell is a soft shell, they are unable to stay in the sun for extended periods of time. When basking, they are wary of their surroundings and if any threat presents itself, they are quick to abandon their basking site in seek of safety. Their agility on land and water make them a hard prey for predators such as raccoons, humans, alligators and snapping turtles. They seek shelter from these threats by diving and concealing themselves in mud. Conservation status Currently, the smooth softshell turtle is considered a species of least conservation concern. However, the species is still facing some wide-ranged threats. These threats include habitat degradation, harvesting for food, and an increase in human disturbances at nesting sites. Additionally, due to their skin's high rate of gas exchange, they are very susceptible to polluted waters. As a result of all of these factors, the smooth softshell turtle has been listed as a species of special concern in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.\\"Apalone mutica \\".

Ann. of the Missouri Botanical Garden, Vol. 76, No. 1 (1989), pp. 128-135 Description Lacandonia is a small parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and has a rhizomatous, mycotrophic habit. This genus exhibits racemous inflorescences and bract-like leaves. The flowers are actinomorphic and are considered \\"inverted\\" from the typical flower arrangement-usually 3 (but sometimes two to four) stamens are in the center of the flower surrounded by 60 to 80 pistils. This characteristic where the position of the androecium and the gynoecium are inverted is unique in the known and described taxa of flowering plants.V√°zquez-Santana, S., Engleman, E.

The chromosome number of Lacandonia schismatica (Lacandoniaceae). Systematic Botany, 15(4): 635-637. Flowers of Lacandonia are bisexual and self-pollinate and fertilize before the flower opens (preanthesis cleistogamy). They are true flowers as opposed to pseudanthia as had been suggested earlier in the literature.Barbara A. Ambrose, Silvia Espinosa-Mat√≠as, Sonia V√°zquez-Santana, Francisco Vergara- Silva, Esteban Mart√≠nez, Judith M√°rquez-Guzm√°n and Elena R. Alvarez-Buylla. (2006). Comparative developmental series of the Mexican triurids support a euanthial interpretation for the unusual reproductive axes of Lacandonia schismatica (Triuridaceae). American Journal of Botany, 93(1): 15-35. The three-celled pollen grains germinate within the anthers and the pollen tube grows through the receptacle to reach the ovaries. L. schismatica can be found flowering year-round when its environment is moist enough, with a particularly active flowering period in November and December. Owing to the prenathesis cleistogamy, a form of autogamy (self-pollination), the known population of L. schismatica lacks genetic variability and has a high incidence of homozygosity.Coello, G., Escalante, A., and Soberon, J. (1993). Lack of genetic variation in Lacandonia schismatica in its only known locality. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 80(4): 898-901. The haploid chromosome number of this species is n = 9. Taxonomy and botanical history Lacandonia is a genus of mycoheterotrophic plants in the Triuridaceae, with very unusual inverted floral morphology. It has two known species:Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesDavidse, G. & al. (eds.) (1994). Flora Mesoamericana 6: 1-543. Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, M√©xico, D.F.. * Lacandonia schismatica E.Mart√≠nez & Ramos 1989 - Chiapas in Mexico * Lacandonia brasiliana A.Melo & M.Alves 2012 - Para√≠ba in Brazil Lacandonia schismatica was first described by Mart√≠nez and Clara Hilda Ramos in 1989, who placed the species in its own family, Lacandoniaceae, which itself was placed in the Triuridales.Mart√≠nez, E. and Ramos, C. H. (1989). Lacandoniaceae (Triuridales): Una neuva familia de Mexico. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 76(1): 128-135. In 1991, Traudel R√ºbsamen-Weustenfeld suggested that L. schismatica be included in the family Triuridaceae within the genus Sciaphila, Peltophyllum, or its own genus. Another study in 1998 presented data that supports the separation of L. schismatica into its own family. The APG II system transferred the genus to the Triuridaceae and placed that family in the Pandanales.The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. (2003). An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 141(4): 399-436. The group was long considered monotypic until the discovery of a second species, Lacandonia brasiliana, in Guaribas Biological Reserve in Brazil in 2012. Evolution The difficulty expressed in placing the species in the proper family is due to the unique floral morphology. How this inverted position of the androecium and gynoecium evolved is unknown, but some studies have posed hypotheses. Davidse and Mart√≠nez suggested that L. schismatica could be one of Richard Goldschmidt's \\"hopeful monsters\\", meaning that the inverted floral morphology could have arisen from a macromutation in the genes that control floral development. It is also possible that chromosomal repatterning, also known as chromosomal rearrangement, was the origin of this species. Since the original description and early work on this species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of L. schismatica flowers that were unisexual. The closely related species Triuris brevistylis was discovered to be mostly dioecious but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, just like that of the normal L. schismatica flowers. This discovery led the authors of the study to conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before L. schismatica and T. brevistylis diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight ¬∞C (10.8 to 14.4 ¬∞F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where L. schismatica is restricted to the warmer lowlands and T. brevistylis has a distribution in the cooler highlands.

The United States House of Representatives had its own slightly different resolution introduced by Representative Stephen G. Porter, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

It released two albums, A Family Affair and Kissing Cousins, and an EP, Reproduction. Origins The original idea was to form punk band that incorporated a banjo into the band. Subject matter of the songs included many songs looking critically at the punk scenes they were (or had been) a part of or linked to. There was an influence from Situationism and anarchism. Th‚Äô Inbred emerged in the alternative music club The Underground Railroad and its all-ages annex The Dry House. Career Th‚Äô Inbred toured across the USA with Raw Power (Italy) and The Rhythm Pigs (El Paso). It also shared the stage with Corrosion of Conformity, The Dead Kennedys, The Circle Jerks, D.R.I., Butthole Surfers. The band lasted from 1984 to 1988. The band's sound was described by Alternative Tentacles' Jello Biafra as \\"Bach meets Black Flag\\" and by Raw Power's drummer as \\"the Rush of Hardcore\\". Singer ‚ÄúArt Reco‚Äù designed politically-charged and/or horror-influenced punk fliers for shows. One such flier, from 1986 is on the cover of ‚ÄòVisual Vitriol, The Street Art and Subcultures of The Punk and Hardcore Generation‚Äô by David A. Ensminger (2011, University Press of Mississippi, Jackson). The band's first recording, Reproduction, was released on the label Frozen Sound with a run of just 500 copies. The second album was produced by Paul Mahern of Zero Boys. Kissing Cousins was released in Europe on Konkurrel. The Inbred material (with a few unreleased cuts) was reissued by Alternative Tentacles in 2009. Their political message was conveyed in outrageous stage antics; a fan went to Inbred shows to be entertained as well as educated, never knowing what would happen next. That sense of theater was illustrated by such diverse examples as the \\"Destroy All Monsters Gig\\" (with Adrenalin O.D., when they showed the Castle condensed version of the above-named film accompanied by \\"The Rites of Spring\\", by Stravinsky, which segued into their opening song) to the lead singer's spot-on parodies of well-known hardcore figures, such as Henry Rollins (of Black Flag). In May, 2013 three members of the band reunited (with an additional member) to be part of a two-day reunion of about fifteen 1980s bands from the Underground Railroad scene, at that same venue, now called 123 Pleasant Street.

Tedald came from the highest ranks of the nobility of central Italy. He was the second son of Tedald, Count of Brescia, of the House of Canossa, and Willa, possible daughter of Theobald II of Spoleto. His elder brother was Boniface III of Tuscany. He was the uncle of Matilda of Tuscany, who was born after his death. As bishop Tedald encouraged and protected the monastic life. He granted permission for Saint Romuald to found a monastery and a hermitage (eremo) at Camaldoli in his diocese (c. 1024). Tedald also sponsored the work of the monk Guido of Arezzo, whose treatise on music theory, the Micrologus, was dedicated to him. At Tedald's invitation, Guido took up the training of the cathedral singers at Arezzo around 1025. The bishop also supported the architect Maginardo, who added to the cathedral during his episcopate and was sent by Tedald in 1026 on a paid visit to Ravenna to study its Byzantine architecture.Conant, 106, who notes that Tedald praised Maginardo as arte architectonica optime erudito, \\"the most erudite in the architectural arts\\".

In January 1939, Kurmark was renamed March of Brandenburg. The Gau was dissolved in 1945, following Allied Soviet occupation of the area and Germany's formal surrender. After the war, the territory of the former Gau became part of the state of Brandenburg in East Germany except for areas beyond the Oder-Neisse line, which were given to the People's Republic of Poland. Most of its territory is now divided between Germany's State of Brandenburg and Poland's Lubusz Voivodeship. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in March of Brandenburg was originally held by Wilhelm Kube (1933‚Äì36), followed by Emil Sturtz (1936‚Äì45). The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and Sachsenhausen concentration camp were located in Gau March of Brandenburg. Ravensbr√ºck was a women's camp. Of the 132,000 prisoners that were sent to the camp 92,000 perished. Of the estimated 200,000 prisoners at Sachsenhausen 30,000 perished. However this figure does not include prisoners that died on the way to the camp or were never registered and killed on arrival, the latter mostly Soviet prisoners of war.

The school is non-selective and currently caters for approximately 1,400 students from Pre-Kindergarten to Year 12.  History  The College commenced in July, 2000 with a small class of Kindergarten students based at Arndell Anglican College at Oakville. Plans for the College commenced in the late 1990s. The north-west growth corridor was targeted by the Sydney Anglican Schools Corporation as a suitable location for a new low-fee Anglican school. Rapid and sustainable population growth in the area were the factors that led to a decision to establish a school at Rouse Hill. The design of the original buildings and site was conducted by the architectural firm of Noel Bell Ridley Smith. The original concept was the responsibility of Mr Ridley Smith and the detail and oversight of the early building projects had been the responsibility of Mr Craig Stephen. A number of sites were considered for the College, on both sides of Windsor Road, with a very significant variation in price. The site chosen was the only available location on the southern side of Windsor Road that had access to town water and sewerage services. This was a very significant provision. The site also boasted a good number of well-established trees and even includes a pocket of the Cumberland Plain Forest. The appointment of the Foundation Principal, Mr Peter Fowler, took place in August 2001. At this time, enrolments and staff appointments were able to take place for the commencement of the College on site in February 2002. Since opening the College has seen steady growth in building development, enrolments, academic achievement and diversity and community. Today the College‚Äôs physical environment consists well equipped and up to date specialist rooms, age specific libraries, a gymnasium/auditorium, dedicated study areas, two ovals, hardcourts and a beach volleyball court. The College has a 20 year development master plan to prepare for ongoing growth and development which includes the completion of K Block for Pre-K and Kindergarten in 2019 and commencement of L Block for Year One and Two students in 2020. School governance Rouse Hill Anglican College is owned by Sydney Anglican Schools Corporation, which is a body established by the Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney. Local policy is vested in a College Council which is appointed by the Corporation. There are 19 schools currently owned by the Sydney Anglican Schools Corporation across the Sydney metropolitan area and on the South Coast extending to Milton (Ulladulla). Day-to-day management including staffing, enrolments and educational programs are the responsibility of the Principal.

Originally called Gau Stade-L√ºneburg, it was renamed Gau Ost- Hannover on 1 October 1928. Initially the Gau was a mere regional Nazi party subsection, but with the growing subjection of all public administration to Nazi party influence after the Machtergreifung, the Gau usurped from 1933 to 1935 more and more the functions of the Provincial government and its superordinate Free State of Prussia. However, after the German constituent states were de facto abolished in 1935, the Gaue replaced them in their responsibilities. Gau East Hannover - like all Nazi party structures - was dismantled after Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945. In 1946 the Control Commission for Germany - British Element (CCG/BE) reconstituted the Province of Hanover as the State of Hanover and later the same year it merged with three smaller neighbouring reconstituted German states to form the new state of Lower Saxony within the British Zone of Occupation. The municipality of Amt Neuhaus was allocated to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in East Hanover was held by Otto Telschow for the duration of the existence of the Gau. The Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was located in the Gau Eastern Hanover. The camp was liberated by the British Army in April 1945 who found the remaining 60,000 inmates in a state of starvation and near-death while the camp was littered with unburied bodies of dead inmates.

The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 and is one of more than ten Claud Beelman buildings included in the National Register. Board of Trade Building Upon completion, the building had of space and fourteen stores on the ground floor, with the remainder of the building utilized for offices. The building was the headquarters for the new California Stock Exchange starting in January 1930. The exchange's trading floor, located on the building's second floor, was patterned after the New York Stock Exchange, measured 89 by and was designed to accommodate 300 brokers. The exchange also included six trading posts with price indicators for 384 issues, a clearing-house, visitors' gallery, smoking-room for members, private offices for executives, committee rooms and locker rooms. The first trade recorded on the exchange in January 1930 involved 100 shares of \\"Bolsa Chica Oil 'A'.\\" The Board of Trade Building was the first on the Pacific Coast to be built with automated elevators that stopped automatically on the floors where buttons were pressed, and without the need for an operator in the elevator car. \\"An elevator system, believed to be an entirely new innovation in Pacific Coast office buildings, is now being installed in the Board of Trade Building ... The four high-speed elevators are equipped with signal control. The entire operation, as far as stopping at floors is concerned, is accomplished automatically by the elevator controller, irrespective of the operator of the car.\\" In 1945, the Board of Trade Building was purchased for $1,250,000 by a syndicate represented by Gray Phelps & Co. Like many of the old buildings in downtown Los Angeles, the building has been converted into live/work lofts.

It was launched in 1980 and shared the chassis with the Mark II/Cressida, sold at Toyopet Store dealerships in Japan. The goal of the Cresta was a higher level of luxury in comparison to the Mark II, while the Chaser was the performance-oriented version of the Mark II, but sold at different dealerships. Often available with two-tone paint and more interior convenience options, with the result ending up being more similar to the Cressida sold in export markets. The Cresta was produced for five generations, and production eventually ceased in 2001, when it was merged with the Chaser to form the short lived Verossa. The name \\"Cresta\\" is Italian/Spanish for \\"crest\\", a type of ornament found on a helmet. __TOC__ X50-X60 series (1980‚Äì1984) The first Cresta was introduced April 1980 and was available exclusively at the renamed Toyota Vista Store (formerly Toyota Auto Store) sales channels across Japan, joining the X40 Chaser. The Cresta was positioned as a high-level luxury sedan just below the established, traditional luxury sedan, the Crown. The sales goal of the Cresta was to provide buyers with a luxury sedan, but not incur tax consequences for exceeding dimension regulations, the vehicle was limited to an engine size at 2000cc as well as dimensions under long, wide, and high, and allowing another Toyota dealership network to offer a luxury-sports oriented product originally exclusive to Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. The Cresta was introduced with halogen headlights to provide a modern European appearance, and was available with a full range of luxury amenities and conveniences. The SOHC 2.0 L M-EU engine was used with an automatic transmission only, which was shared with the Crown, as well as the 2.0L 1G-EU straight six engine, also used in the Crown. Trim levels used names meant to suggest luxury overtones, such as Super Lucent, Super Touring, Super Deluxe, Super Custom, and Custom, names that were similarly used on the Crown. Upper level trim levels used two- tone paint schemes to further the Cresta's elevated status towards a younger demographic. The Nissan competitor was the Laurel. 1982‚Äì1984 Toyota Cresta Super Lucent Twin Cam This new luxury approach was well received with buyers. In August 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project (\\"Flagship\\" and \\"No. 1 vehicle\\"; alternatively called the \\"Circle-F\\" project), a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world-class luxury sedan for international markets. This led to the creation of an all new, full size luxury sedan designed for export markets, called the Lexus LS. X70 series (1984‚Äì1988) The X70 series was introduced March 8, 1984, with styling cues shared with the platform sharing Mark II, with the Cresta now offered as a 4-door, 4-window sedan (with window frames) while the X70 Mark II was offered as a 4-window hardtop bodystyle similar to the Chaser, alongside a 6-window style Mark II sedan. The X70 series continued to enjoy the popularity enjoyed by the first generation Cresta. Power side view mirrors were now installed western style at the leading edge of the front doors instead of on the front fenders above the front wheels to provide a more modern appearance, and retracted electrically for confined parking spaces. The 2.2-litre diesel engine used in the first generation was upgraded to one with 2.4 litres displacement. Styling upgrades were introduced in 1985, with a twin turbo 1G-GTEU introduced October 1985, with trim level designation GT Twin Turbo. As a result of the twin turbo introduction, the M-TEU engine was no longer offered. Foglights imbedded in the front bumper were made standard equipment, with a minor styling upgrade August 1986. X80 series (1988‚Äì1992) The third generation was introduced March 8, 1988, with a transition away from straight edges previously used by Toyota products of the period and it was no longer a hardtop sedan. The top-of-the-line model, called the Super Lucent G included a supercharger equipped 1G-GZE engine. The 1JZ-GE and 1JZ-GTE were shared with the Chaser. Special anniversary trim levels were introduced May 1990, with a body refresh introduced later that year. X90 series (1992‚Äì1996) The X90 Cresta debuted in 1992 with significant styling and mechanical changes over the X80. The car increased in size and gained some new trim levels similar to its sister cars, the Mark II and Chaser. Engines were carried over from the past generation albeit without the 7M or supercharged 1G I6's. Toyota also changed the front grille and taillight design in 1994. Under Japanese exterior dimension regulations, this series was no longer regarded as a \\"compact car\\". The X90 Cresta was offered in 4 primary trim levels throughout its run (the SC, Suffire, Super Lucent and Tourer), each with their own options and even more specific trim categorizations. All cars shared common longitudinal layout architecture as well as certain options standard, like automatic climate control and side-impact bars, not to mention driver-side airbags in 1995. The base trim level SC had very little in terms of options; it was powered by either a petrol or diesel engine mated to a 4-speed automatic. The next level Suffire had the same options available (or lack thereof) as the SC plus an optional 5-speed manual. The Super Lucent however was a much different story: this trim offered 3 different straight 6 engines from 2.0L-3.0L mated to an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic with options like a moon roof or a factory LSD. Further differentiating Super Lucent models was the G package, which featured ABS, 15\\" wheels, cruise control and a leather interior. Permanent 4WD was offered as an option in 1993. The various sized engine displacements gave Japanese buyers choices as to which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The Tourer trim levels all featured a 2.5L 1JZ straight 6, but with a few differences. The Tourer S had a naturally aspirated engine and only a 4-speed automatic whereas the Tourer V's came with a pair of turbochargers and the option of a 5-speed manual. All Tourers had front- and rear-stabilizer bars but only the Tourer V's came with traction control, ABS and an LSD standard. Tourer V's were very popular amongst enthusiasts and drifters due to their stiff chassis and power-to-weight ratio. X100 series (1996‚Äì2001) 1998 Cresta In 1996 the X100 series was released. In popular media, this car is notable for featuring in the anime and manga Great Teacher Onizuka, in which it is owned by Hiroshi Uchiyamada, whose car gets destroyed multiple times after a series of mishaps.

She was built by Richard Chapman at Bideford and launched on 5 May 1807. She saw action in the War of 1812 and was sold in 1817.Colledge, p. 146 Career She was commissioned in March 1807 under Captain Header Whittier.Winfield (2008), p.236. On 11 November 1807 she sailed to the West Indies. She served under a number of captains there, including Rowland Bevan (1808), Thomas Thrush (1 May - August 1809), William Charlton (died 7 August 1810), William Henry Shirreff (18 November 1809 - 1811), Thomas Graves, and Thomas Huskisson (May 1811 to June 1812). Captain Richard Plummer Davies received promotion to Post-captain on 19 June 1812 and then took command of Garland. =Prize taking= On 28 July 1812, Garland recaptured Hassan, which was sailing to Havannah with a cargo of sundries. Five days later, Garland captured Superb, which was sailing to Boston in ballast. That same day, 2 August, Garland captured Dal, which was sailing to Newhaven with rum and sugar, and Madisonia, sailing to Alexandria with sugar and hides. On 13 September 1812 Garlands boats captured the American privateer Poor Sailor. Poor Sailor was armed with one long 6-pounder gun and had a crew of 15 men. Then on 4 December Garland captured the brig San Pedro, which was sailing from New Orleans to St. Domingo. =Mediterranean= In 1814 Garland was off the north coast of Spain, still under Davies. In 1815, following Napoleon's escape from Elba, the Admiralty sent Garland and Undaunted to the Adriatic, under the orders of Captain Charles Austen, brother of the novelist Jane Austen, in . Austen's mission was to co-operate with the Austrians and to intercept some Neapolitan warships. Phoenix and Garland watched two large frigates at Brindisi, while Undaunted cruised northwards along the coast. After the surrender of Naples, following the military convention of Casalanza, Austen persuaded the captains of the two Neapolitan frigates to switch their allegiance to the restored monarch, Ferdinand IV of Naples.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.75-6. Next, Phoenix, , Garland and sailed to the Greek Archipelago to look for a French squadron comprising the frigate Junon, the 32-gun corvette Victorieuse, two brigs and two schooners. The British objective was to prevent the French squadron capturing merchant vessels traversing the area and to suppress piracy. However, it turned out that the French had left the area; shortly afterwards peace was restored. Fate In 1816 Garland was out of commission at Deptford. Garland was finally sold on 9 May 1817 to a Mr Hill for ¬£1,500. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References *Colledge, J.J.

To accomplish this, they state four points that speak for the foundation and its objectives. 1: \\"A fully open government data.\\" 2: \\"Civic engagement initiatives for broad-based public participation.\\" 3: \\"Collaboration with outside partners in government innovation.\\" 4: \\"Advocating for full public financing of elections and comprehensive electoral reforms.\\"  Sunlight Foundation  The Sunlight Foundation was founded in 2006 with the main goal using the internet and technology to connect citizens of the US to Congress and the federal government. The foundation is a government transparency advocacy group pushing for policies that optimize civic engagement. This foundation is heavily funded through donations, and through these donations, the foundation was able to collaborate with PPF to create OpenCongress.org. PPF was given a $737,300 donation by the Sunlight Foundation. A criticism the foundation has faced was its claim of being a non-partisan. The company has been viewed as left leaning due to its original director, Zephyr Teachout, becoming a Democratic politician. Additionally, the companies primary funder, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is known for its left-of-center political views.  OpenCongress.org  OpenCongress.org was a non-profit, non-partisan public resource where citizens interaction with the government was completed through the companies webpage. . It was released in 2007 and founded by both the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation. Users could contact members of Congress via the internet by sending an email to congressional members through a page on the website, and were able to gain access to both real-time news and government data. After, the users could share it with the OpenCongress.org community and their social media pages to interact with the public. Across a span of eight years, the website had 29 million visits and 70 million page visits in addition to its 200,000 registered users. In March 2016, OpenCongress officially closed its doors and merged into a new website called GovTrack. OpenCongress no longer has an up and running website.  GovTrack  Created in 2004 and eventually taking over OpenCongress.org, GovTrack was yet another non-partisan website for the public to obtain legislative information that encouraged engagement with the government. To aid participation in government, GovTrack pursues new developments on issues that its users find important, and publishes them for the public to use. This is all free, so the information can be viewed or shared by anyone with internet access. Additionally, the company tracks bills and collects information on Congressional members. To ensure the company is non-partisan, they do not accept grants from partisan organizations, and have \\"no financers, sponsors, investors or partners with a political party or government agency\\". Comparable sites to OpenCongress and GovTrack are OpenGovernment.org, AskThem.io, and Councilmatic, which all have the same goal of connecting local residents to state-level officials to express their opinions.  AskThem.io  AskThem.io was another later project developed by PPF and launched in February 2014. It was a \\" free, open-source, non-profit, non-partisan platform where the public could interact with public figures\\". The website had a question-and-answer page where users could have their questions answered by. These people included members of government and candidates in every state and congressional district, along with any verified Twitter account. AskThem has access to over \\"142,000 elected officials, including all 100 state governors, 432 state representatives and over 1,400 state legislatures nationwide\\". AskThem worked as followed: * \\"Anyone can ask a question to any elected official or verified Twitter account.\\" * \\"People sign-on to questions they support, voting them up and circulating them like online petitions.\\" * \\"When a question reaches a pre-set threshold, AskThem delivers it to the recipient and encourages a public response.\\" In June 2018, David Moore posted on the Participatory Politics Foundation blog that AskThem.io's website will be disabled until further notice. With the upcoming 2020 election, Moore is asking for volunteers to redesign the companies website with the intent increase \\"public accountability\\".  Councilmatic  Created by both the Participatory Politics Foundation and a civic tech company DataMade, Councilmatic is a website that provides its users up to date with information about their city council. Currently, Councilmatic is relaying government information from New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. It is an open-data community resource that can publish data from city-legislations, elected officials, committees and more. The company directly states, \\"Coordinated by non-profit PPF, this program works to \\"close the feedback loop\\" with local elected officials\\".  David Moore  David Moore was the Executive Director of both the Participatory Politics Foundation and their sister organization, Participatory Culture Foundation from 2007 to 2017. He also served as the program manager for OpenCongress.org from 2007, until its closing in 2016. After working as an Executive Director at PPF, Moore stepped down from the position and co-founded Sludge in 2018. \\"Sludge is an investigative journalism website that aims to uncover systemic corruption in the media\\" using blockchain technology.

After sailing for Japan out to find and possibly reconvert the notorious apostate Christavao Ferreira, who went to Japan and renounced his faith there, he was arrested as soon as he got off his ship. After three days of torture in the pit of Nagasaki, he was beheaded..

A painting of his death, Martyrdom of Saint Marcello Mastrilli (1664), was made by Antonio Maria Vassallo. Susceptible to visions, he was particularly influenced by visitations by the Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier, who appeared to him twice in 1633,Japanese Sketches in The Month, Volume 11 (1869) p.241 and foretold him his martyrdom. St. Frances Xavier is credited with twice miraculously restoring Mastrilli's health (even if only to incite him to do missionary work in Japan), and since the account reportedly spread quickly through Italy, the \\"novena of grace,\\" in honor of St. Francis Xavier, was established. Mastrilli's initiative is supposedly to thank for the presence of a silver casket in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa, which houses relics of the body of St. Francis Xavier.

He was the viscount of √Äger and Cabrera from 1145. He was the son of Pon√ß II de Cabrera and Sancha. Guerau is today most famous for his ensenhamen, a long didactic poem written for his jongleur, Cabra. Cabra's name, which means goat and is related to the name of his master's viscounty (Cabrera), probably indicates that he was Guerau's herald, since heralds often took the names of the arms of their lords. Guerau's arms bore a goat. The ensenhamen is divided into 216 lines. The rhyme scheme is of two four-syllable rhyming lines followed by an octosyllabic line ending in -on, repeated. The entire poem is basically a disorderly and wordy catalogue the things (names, songs, and stories) which Cabra ought to know in his capacity as public entertainer, but which in fact he does not know. The eruditeness of the work is impressive, giving evidence of Guerau's learning, the writings he would have had access to in twelfth- century Catalonia, and the typical repertoire of a contemporary jongleur. The ensenhamen begins with twenty-four lines of criticism concerning what Cabra does not do. He is accused of mal saps viular / e pietz chantar: poor knowledge of how to play the viol and worse still of singing. He cannot finish with a proper \\"Breton cadence\\" (tempradura de breton). Guerau goes on: {  :Non sabs balar :ni trasgitar :a guiza de juglar guascon.  :You don't know how to dance :nor how to gesture :in the manner of the Gascon jongleurs. } Finally, Guerau lists the various genres and types of song which Cabra does not have in his repertoire: sirventesc, balaresc, estribot, retroencha, and contenson. It is clear that by Guerau's time, Occitan lyric poetry had already witnessed a proliferation of genres. To the historian of culture, these twenty-four lines are an important source for the qualifications of a good jongleur. References *Riquer, Mart√≠ de (1964).

Many of them originated as ferries, dating back to the 1820s and 1830s, and carrying travelers across the Chattahoochee River and several other smaller rivers. Several were also covered bridges, very few of which remain as historic sites. Abbott's Bridge Crossed the Chattahoochee River near present-day Johns Creek and Duluth. Abbotts Bridge Road exists today, carrying State Route 120 over the Chattahoochee River not far from Northview High School. Blair's Bridge Brown's Bridge Brown's Bridge was a covered bridge located between Cumming and Gainesville, over the Chattahoochee River. It was carried downstream but intact in 1946, by a major flood on February 7. Divers have reported it still intact under 120 feet or 36.5 meters of Lake Lanier, which filled the river a few years later. Browns Bridge Road (part of Georgia 369) still exists east of Georgia 9 at Coal Mountain. Just upstream of the original bridge location, a modern bridge carries the road over the lake. To see more information on the modern Browns Bridge, click Browns Bridge A different Brown Bridge (not Browns) was located near Covington. Cheshire Bridge White settlers originally settled the corridor in the 1820s. Two of these early settlers were Napoleon and Jerome Cheshire, two brothers who owned farms on opposite sides of South Fork of Peachtree Creek. They connected their farms by a bridge known as the Cheshire Bridge, giving the Cheshire Bridge Road its name.\\"Cheshire Bridge Road Study\\", 1999, City of Atlanta Department of Planning, Development and Neighborhood Conservation, Bureau of Planning In conjunction with the Cheshire Bridge Road Task Force \\"History\\", Lindridge-Martin Manor Neighbors Association Concord Covered Bridge Concord Covered Bridge, Smyrna, Georgia, USA The Concord Covered Bridge is still located on Covered Bridge Road (past Concord Road) west of Smyrna, and is part of the county historic district named for it. It still carries cars over Nickajack Creek, but is one lane at a time. The Silver Comet Trail also runs over the creek on a former railroad trestle very nearby. The East-West Connector, completed in 1997, was designed to protect the area by not connecting to Concord Road, thereby reducing potential traffic counts on the bridge. Grimes Bridge Located over Vickery Creek (Big Creek) in Roswell, just north of the Chattahoochee River. Since July 2008, Grimes Bridge Road is closed until 2009 to replace the bridge. Haynes Bridge Located near Alpharetta. Haynes Bridge Road exists today, carrying drivers from Johns Creek to Downtown Alpharetta, past North Point Mall near Georgia 400. Holcomb Bridge The Holcomb Bridge was over the Chattahoochee River, on what is now the edge of the city of Roswell. Holcomb Bridge Road carries State Route 140, becoming Crossville Road (State Route 92, as SR-140 turns north onto Alpharetta Highway to Houze Road) near downtown Roswell in the northwest, and turning left before crossing Peachtree Parkway/SR-141 and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and ending at Buford Highway/US-23 in downtown Norcross. Because it is so heavily traveled and densely developed as an arterial road, it is probably the most well-known \\"bridge\\" road in the area, along with Cheshire Bridge Road. There is also Old Holcomb Bridge Road, a previous alignment of part of the road northwest of the interchange with Georgia 400, since the freeway was built in the late 1960s. Howell Bridge Unlike Howell Mills and Howell Ferry, located near exurban Canton. Hudson Bridge Located near Stockbridge. Jones Bridge Jones Bridge after collapse, February 2018 Formerly Jones Ferry. Jones Bridge spanned the Chattahoochee River from 1904-1922, falling into disrepair in the 1930s. Most articles report that half of the bridge was \\"stolen\\" sometime in the 1940s; however, aerial photography appear to show that the theft occurred between 1955-1960. Both trusses were still visible in the 1955 aerial photograph but not in a 1960 aerial photograph. Neighbors didn't know the workers cutting the bridge were not authorized to do so until it was too late. There are no reports of the culprits having been identified or caught. The bridge finally collapsed into the Chattahoochee River on January 25, 2018. The historic Jones Bridge is visible via 2 parks that are adjacent to that section of the Chattahoochee River or if traveling down the river by small boat, canoe or kayak. * Jones Bridge Park is located on the east side of the river in Gwinnett County (Peachtree Corners, GA). It has the most amenities (parking, easy river access points [ramp & stairs], restrooms, playground, volleyball, grills, etc.) and offers the better views and easiest access to see/photograph the bridge. * Chattahoochee River National Park - Jones Bridge Unit is nicely suited to boaters and hikers. This park is located on the opposite side of the river in Fulton County (Johns Creek, GA) with basic amenities (parking, restroom), plus longer trails and a boat launch area (which Jones Bridge Park does not have). To see the remains of the bridge, one must follow the trails along the river upstream for 1/4-1/2 mile. Their site says wheelchair accessible, but the Jones Bridge Unit section is extremely limited beyond the parking area. Keith's Bridge Located near Gainesville, Keith's Bridge was a covered bridge over the Chestatee River. Burned in the late 1940s, it is also now submerged under Lake Lanier. Keith Bridge Road still exists today. Kimball Bridge Located near Alpharetta. Medlock Bridge Located between present-day Peachtree Corners and Johns Creek. Medlock Bridge Road exists today, beginning at the edge of Historic Norcross and traveling through Peachtree Corners and Johns Creek. The road carries State Route 141 over the Chattahoochee River and through Johns Creek. This road is discontinuous, as for approximately 1.5 miles between the intersection with SR 141 and the Chattahoochee River it is known as Peachtree Parkway. Plaster's Bridge Until around 1915, Piedmont Road was named Plaster‚Äôs Bridge Road. It was named for a bridge that Benjamin Plaster built over Peachtree Creek.

Before that, from 1925 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. In 1939, Gau East Prussia expanded following the annexation of the Klaipƒóda Region from Lithuania and the occupation of Poland, while a sliver of territory from the gau was transferred to Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. After Germany's attack on the USSR, the Belarusian city of Hrodna () also became part of the Gau. After the war, the territory of the former Gau became part of the Russian SFSR exclave of Kaliningrad in the Soviet Union, major sections were given to Poland, and the area of the Klaipƒóda Region was returned to the Lithuanian SSR and Hrodna - to the Belarusian SSR within the Soviet Union. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in East Prussia was held by Wilhelm Stich from 1925 to 1926, Bruno Gustav Scherwitz from 1926 to 1927, Hans Hohnfeldt (acting) from 1927 to 1928 and Erich Koch from 1 October 1928 through the duration of the war.Michael D.

Career When king Cambyses II defeated pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium (525 BCE), Egypt became a satrapy of the Achaemenid empire, and Aryandes was appointed satrap shortly after. In 522 BCE, Aryandes was overthrown due to a revolt against the Achaemenid rule led by a native Egyptian pharaoh, Petubastis III. The rebellion was personally quelled by the new king Darius I during his expedition to Egypt in 518 BCE, and Aryandes reinstated. The satrap then attempted to subjugate Libya with poor results. Around 496 BCE, Aryandes fell out of favour with Darius I and was deposed and replaced by Pherendates. The reason for this decision is unknown, with Herodotus and later Polyaenus claiming that the satrap started minting his own silver coinage, calling it aryandic in opposition of the golden, already existing daric, thus irritating the great king. This story is now considered unlikely, also because no aryandic has ever been found to date.ARYANDES at the Encyclop√¶dia Iranica It appears more likely that Darius had real concerns of a declaration of independence by Aryandes for his satrapy.

Like almost all Danish religious houses it was dissolved during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.  History  The first Franciscan establishment in Svendborg was the chapel built in 1236. This building was destroyed when the town of Svendborg was burned to the ground by King Abel of Denmark in 1247 after a short siege. Another friary was built in about 1288 as the result of a gift of land for a chapel for the Franciscans from Herr Astrad Frakke, Herr Niels Bille (the brother of Bishop Johannes Bille), Herr Niels Beger and several other local nobles. Count Gert of Holstein and his son also made gifts of properties to support the Franciscan friars in Svendborg. In 1268 Lady Gro Gunnarsdatter Vint, the extremely wealthy widow of Esbj√∏rn Vognsen, gave away her considerable fortune to abbeys, priories and friaries throughout Denmark when she joined the Poor Clares in Roskilde. The \\"brothers' [friars'] chapel at Svendborg\\" is specifically mentioned in the list of her beneficiaries. The Gothic church was completed in 1361 and was dedicated to Saint Catherine. Svendborg was burned by the Hanseatic Fleet in 1389, after which the friary was rebuilt yet again. During the 15th century it expanded considerably, and the buildings were extended several times. The main friary precinct of this period consisted of a rectangular enclosure containing a church, dormitory, refectory, and servants' quarters, as well as a cloister surrounding a central garden. The buildings were constructed from red brick, the most common building material at the time. The friary had a close connection with St. George's Chapel and Hospital just outside Svendborg, the last remaining medieval leper hospital in Denmark. One of the most controversial times for the friary was in 1500 when Queen Christina, who was at that point in direct control of Svendborg, gave the whole of Bysen Street (Bysenstr√¶de) to the Franciscans to use as accommodation for the town's poor and sick in their care. The mayor and the town council strongly disapproved of this action, which caused a severe rift between the town and the friary. Dissolution During the short civil war known as the Count's Feud (Danish:Grevens Fejde), Svenborg made the mistake of siding with Count Christoffer, acting for Christian II of Denmark. When Christian III's troops took Svenborg and the rest of Fynen in 1534, they pillaged the town and its churches. With the Lutherans now firmly in control of the town and country, the priory was permanently closed, though by the end of 1530 it had been abandoned by the Franciscans. The last guardian of the priory, Hans Gaas, quickly accepted the and became the first Lutheran pastor of Our Lady's Church (Danish:Vor Frue Kirke) in Svendborg. The priory was taken over by the town. The friars went to other Franciscan houses outside Denmark or returned to secular life. The friary church became a parish church for the people of Svendborg. The east wing was demolished shortly after the Reformation. The west wing of the priory was converted into a Latin school which operated until 1740. The buildings where the Latin School had been located were torn down in 1875. In 1586 the north wing of the friary was turned into a hospital founded by Lady Helvig Hardenberg. The old hospital was torn down in 1870. After dissolution By 1828 the former friary church had fallen into serious disrepair and the town council decided to demolish it. The buildings were blown up, the ground levelled and the site in the town centre redeveloped with houses and shops: some buildings used parts of the old friary walls as foundations. The churchyard containing thousands of common and noble graves was cleared and the most recently buried bodies transferred to a cemetery a few streets away. The altarpiece however was preserved and is now located in Thur√∏ Church. Recent excavations by Svendborg Museum have revealed that the later friary complex was much larger than was previously thought, and contained many structures in addition to the old rectangular layout.

Unlike the H1 and H2 receptors which have primarily peripheral actions, but cause sedation if they are blocked in the brain, H3 receptors are primarily found in the brain and are inhibitory autoreceptors located on histaminergic nerve terminals, which modulate the release of histamine. Histamine release in the brain triggers secondary release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine via stimulation of H1 receptors in the cerebral cortex. Consequently, unlike the H1 antagonist antihistamines which are sedating, H3 antagonists have stimulant and nootropic effects, and are being researched as potential drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Examples of selective H3 antagonists include clobenpropit, ABT-239, ciproxifan, conessine, A-349,821, betahistine, and pitolisant.  History  The histamine H3 receptor (H3R) was discovered in 1983 and was one of the last receptors that were discovered using conventional pharmacological methods. Its structure was discovered later as a part of an effort to identify a commonly expressed G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the central nervous system (CNS). The pharmacology of H3R is very complicated which has made drug development difficult. Many different functional isoforms of the H3R exist which means it could theoretically be possible to target a single isoform specifically. That may, however, be difficult due to genetic variability of the isoforms as well as differing functionality of each one. H3R ligands have now been classified as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists, depending on the signaling assay used.  Mechanism of Action  The H3R is a GPCR and it has been described as a presynaptic autoreceptor, regulating the release of histamine and also as a heteroreceptor, regulating neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and GABA. The receptor has a high constitutive activity which means that it can signal without being activated by an agonist. H3R regulates the release of neurotransmitters by influencing the amount of intracellular calcium. When activated, it blocks the influx of calcium which leads to inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters. Antagonists of the receptors cause synthesis and release of these neurotransmitters which promotes waking. H3Rs are mostly expressed on the histaminergic neurons of the CNS but can also be found in various areas of the peripheral nervous system. The H3R has been found in high densities in the basal ganglia, hippocampus and cortical areas which are all regions of the brain associated with cognition. The histaminergic system has been described as having a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, schizophrenia and narcolepsy.  Development  = Early Pharmacophore = In the beginning of development for H3R ligands the focus was on the agonist histamine which contains an imidazole ring in its structure. The structural diversity among H3R is limited and all known H3R agonists today contain an imidazole ring. The problem with the imidazole containing compounds was the inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes which resulted in severe drug interactions. They also had difficulty in crossing the blood-brain-barrier. Many compounds were tested but they were too toxic to be useful. Off target function on H4R and other receptors was also a problem with imidazole-based antagonists. The wide variety of potential pathophysiology of H3R in brain disorders makes H3R antagonists interesting for drug development.  Thioperamide  The first imidazole-based antagonist that was developed was thioperamide which was very potent and selective but was not usable as a drug due to hepatotoxicity. It was originally designed to improve wakefulness and cognition deficit. A recent study showed potential thioperamide treatment of the circadian rhythm of patients with parkinson‚Äôs disease. Chemical structure of thioperamide. Early pharmacophore contained an imidazole ring. = New Pharmacophore = The focus turned to non-imidazole H3R antagonists. They do not seem to interact with the CYP family on the same level as imidazole-based H3R antagonists and can reach the CNS more easily. Unfortunately other problems have come up such as strong binding to hERG K+ channel, phospholipidosis as well as problems with P-gp substrate. Strong binding to hERG K+ channel can lead to QT prolongation.  Pitolisant  Pitolisant was the first antagonist /inverse agonist to proceed to clinical trials and is the only drug that has been approved by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe. It is highly selective for the H3 receptor. Pitolisant has high oral bioavailability and easily accesses the brain. It undergoes extensive first-pass effects through the CYP4A4 enzyme in the gut. The whole metabolic pathway has not yet been established but involves a few CYP enzymes. It has been proved to be useful for maintaining waking-state in the daytime for people with narcolepsy. Side effects encountered in clinical trials were found to be dose-dependent. As expected, some of the adverse effects were neuropsychiatric in character most common of which were insomnia, headache and anxiety. Pitolisant can also potentially cause a prolonged QT interval so caution is advised in cardiac patients. Keeping doses as low as possible can minimize risk for adverse events. It can be found under the tradename Wakix and is considered an orphan drug. It was approved by the European Commission on 31 March 2016. It is available in 4.5 mg and 18 mg tablets. Chemical structure of Pitolisant. New pharmacophore contain non-imidazole compounds, in the case of Pitolisant, a piperidine ring. = Structure Activity Relationship = A general structural pattern that is necessary for the antagonist affinity for H3R has been described. An H3R antagonist needs to have a basic amine group which is linked to an aromatic/lipophilic region that is connected to either a polar group or another basic group or a lipophilic region. Structure activity relationship for H3R antagonists  Clinical Significance  H3R antagonists/inverse agonists demonstrate a possible way to treat diseases of the CNS for example Alzheimer's disease (AD), attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD), schizophrenia (SCH), pain, and narcolepsy. = Narcolepsy = Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder which is characterised by chronic sleepiness. Cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis can also be present in narcolepsy. H3R antagonism leads to histamine release into the cerebrospinal fluid which promotes wakefulness. Therefore, H3R antagonists have been studied in the hope of treating narcolepsy. Pitolisant has been approved for treatment of narcolepsy and other H3R antagonists are in clinical trials. = Alzheimer's disease (AD) = Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain. Histamine plays a well documented role in AD, however the varying levels of histamine in different areas of the brain make it hard to demonstrate a direct link between histaminergic neurotransmission and AD pathology. In vivo studies have shown that a number of H3R antagonists facilitate learning and memory. Thioperamide blocks H3R and causes an increase in neuronal histamine release which then modifies cognition processes through H1R and H2R and other receptors (e.g. cholinergic and GABA). Degeneration of histaminergic neurons in AD doesn‚Äôt correlate to H3R expressions since a large portion of H3R in the brain are located elsewhere deep in cortical and thalamocortical neurons among others. = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) = ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is most pronounced in children. Current pharmacological treatments consist of stimulant medications (e.g. methylphenidate), non- stimulant medication (e.g. atomoxetine) and Œ±2 agonists. These medications can cause adverse effects and some types have the potential to cause addiction. Developing alternative treatments is therefore desirable. In vivo studies show potential of using H3R antagonists in ADHD to aid in attention and cognitive activity by elevating release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine. = Schizophrenia (SCH) = SCH is a serious neurological syndrome which is characterised by shifting of thinking, behavior and emotion. Disruption of dopamine and other neurotransmitter systems plays a significant role in the development of the disease. Current treatments are based on first and second generation antipsychotics which are dopamine antagonists. These drugs have many undesirable side-effects. Histaminergic neurons seem to play a role in schizophrenia and H3R are co-localized with dopamine receptors in GABAergic neurons. Even if H3R antagonist don‚Äôt seem to be effective against positive symptoms of SCH studies have shown that H3R antagonists may be useful in treating negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia as an adjunct.

At the same time, it also replaced bus lines in nearby cities and began operating the Gifu Community Bus. Branch offices Gifu Bus operates 11 offices in the area, three of which are located within the city of Gifu. The other locations within Gifu Prefecture include Yamagata, Mino, Seki, Guj≈ç, Kakamigahara and Ginan. The final location is in neighboring Aichi Prefecture's Nishiharu. Drivers' nameplates indicate the branch to which they belong, so some nameplates indicate branch offices that have been closed, moved or merged and are not included in the list above. Fares Gifu Bus' local routes are divided into regions and fares vary based on the distance traveled between the boarding and unboarding locations. The base fare is 200 yen, though reduced fares are available for children and the elderly. Riders can take a numbered ticket when boarding the bus, with their fare indicated on a board at the front of the bus as they get off. Until March 31, 2007, riders were able to use prepaid fare cards to pay for their fare. These cards were available in various denominations and offered riders a bonus of 5-15%, depending on the denomination purchased. These prepaid cards were replaced by the Ayuca smart cards, which first went on sale on December 1, 2006. Like the prepaid cards, these smart cards replaced cash and gave bonuses to riders when they recharged their cards. Both systems were used simultaneously for four months until the prepaid cards were stopped. Vehicles Hino Motors hybrid bus used by Gifu Bus The majority of the buses in use were made by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, because those were the buses used by Nagoya Railroad when the routes began. However, the buses run by Gifu were models made by either Isuzu or Nissan Diesel, so there is some variety among bus types. Additionally, some buses were purchased from Kawasaki Heavy Industries many years ago; these buses have been refurbished and are still in use. In 2005, Gifu Bus began using non-step buses from Hino Motors to accommodate the aging population of the area. The company also uses hybrid buses made by Mitsubishi that were first used in Expo 2005 in neighboring Aichi Prefecture; most of these buses are operated by the Yanagase Branch Office. Hino Motors provided the hybrid buses used exclusively on the Shinai Loop Line. The sightseeing and highway buses generally use Mitsubishi buses, but there are also a few made by Mercedes-Benz.

He spent most of his career at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York. He is best known for his formulation of the biopsychosocial model, a general theory of illness and healing. Early life Engel was born in New York City in 1913. He completed his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Dartmouth College in 1934. In the same year, he entered Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland to study medicine. He received his medical degree in 1938. Academic career After completing his medical degree, Engel began an internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. There physicians such as Eli Moschowitz and Lawrence Kubie were incorporating psychosomatics into the clinical service. At the time, Engel was skeptical of psychoanalysis and psychosomatic medicine. He was committed to purely physical explanations of disease processes. Engel began a Research Fellowship in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and also Graduate Assistant in Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women's Hospital) in 1941. He came under the supervision of physician Soma Weiss, who at this time was becoming interested in psychosomatics. At this time, he first met with psychiatrist John Romano. Romano had arrived in Boston several years before Engel. With the encouragement from Weiss, Engel and Romano collaborated on a study of delusional patients. In 1942, Romano became chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of Cincinnati. Romano invited Engel to join the faculty at Cincinnati and Engel accepted the invitation. At this point Engel \\"converted\\" to the psychosomatic school. =University of Rochester= Romano was given the opportunity to establish an entirely new psychiatry department at the School of Medicine and Dentistry of the University of Rochester Medical Center in 1946. Engel joined Romano in Rochester. He had dual appointments in psychiatry and medicine departments. He was responsible for establishing a medical psychiatric liaison service staffed largely by internists. He became deeply involved in the incorporation of psychiatric training in the medical school curriculum, and also began his own training in psychoanalysis. Engel began collaboration with Franz Reichsman on the Monica project, a study which extended from Monica's infancy to adulthood, in 1953. By the mid-1950s, he was considered as one of the major figures in psychosomatic studies. He was prominent in the American Psychosomatic Society. He also edited its journal, Psychosomatic medicine and began publishing numerous books and articles on the relation of emotion and disease and on the incorporation of these ideas into medical training and clinical practice. Under his direction, the program at the university became a leading center in the development of psychosomatic theory and training. His ideas came to be termed as the biopsychosocial model. The fundamental assumption of the biopsychosocial model is that health and illness are consequences of the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. This concept is particularly important in health psychology. This model was theorised by Engel at Rochester and putatively discussed in a 1977 article in the journal Science. Later years In his later years, Engel never lost his sense of humor and his generosity. He was admired by his students and physicians who worked with him. He died suddenly of heart failure in 1999. Awards and honors Engel received many awards and honors from the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association for his work. Works Engel, George L., and R.W.

It is one of the oldest church buildings and one of few remaining 19th-century colonial buildings in the City of Perth. Architecture Wesley Church is built of load-bearing brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church has a strong verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to the walls of the building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles. History Tucks Oilette 1911/1912) The first Methodists arrived in the Swan River Colony on 3 February 1830 aboard the Tranby, to found a small religious community at Tranby House, six kilometres (four miles) upstream along the Swan River from the newly established town of Perth (approximately on the site of the current suburb of Maylands). The group was led by Joseph Hardey and John Wall Hardey, and included a surgeon, preacher, bricklayer, blacksmith, shoemaker, surveyor, hatter, midshipman and several farmers. The site for the church was purchased from James Inkpen (the first recorded Methodist to arrive in the colony, having arrived in December 1829) at a cost of ¬£400. The new church was the third Methodist place of worship to be built in the forty years in which the denomination had been established in the colony. The original church was subsequently used as a caretaker's cottage; the second was used for Sunday School, then an armoury and then a store. George Shenton (another prominent Methodist, the first Mayor of Perth, and a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council) had earlier suggested that the name of the church be Wesley Church, and promised ¬£1,000 to establish the building fund, with Joseph Hardey contributing a further ¬£500. Wesley Church was designed by Richard Roach Jewell, an architect, circuit steward, clerk of colonial works and church member. Jewell was responsible for the design of a number of other prominent Perth buildings, including the Cloisters (1858), the Pensioner Barracks (1863), and extensions and alterations to Government House (1864) and Perth Town Hall (1870). Jewell designed Wesley Church in the fashionable Gothic revival style, a style which he successfully adapted in his other buildings. Jewell's plan for Wesley Church, comprising the nave, chancel and bell tower with a tall and elegant spire, was accepted with one alteration - the relocation of the bell tower from the north-east side to the south-east side. The foundation stone was laid on 25 October 1867 by Governor John Stephen Hampton. The church was opened on Sunday 10 April 1870 with services by Reverend William Lowe (who married Joseph Hardey's daughter Mary Jane), Rev. William Traylen and Rev. T.C. Laurence. The total cost of the building was about ¬£3,000 - a considerable sum for a church membership of 138 (with a quarterly income of a little over ¬£66). The original bricks were made from local clay pits and the floor is made of jarrah. The church bell, originally hanging in the southern tower, came from the sailing ship Tranby, which brought the original members of the congregation to the colony. The church nave In June 1875 the first church organ in the colony was installed at Wesley Church, a Bishop and Son instrument of two manuals and pedal with 15 speaking stops. In 1880 a clergy vestry, choir vestry and organ loft were added to the Church at a cost of ¬£385. In 1896 further alterations and additions were made, including the construction of the north-east tower (which buried the original foundation stone), the side galleries, the ceiling to the nave and the south-west porch. These alterations were undertaken by Talbot Hobbs (a prominent Perth-based architect) at a cost of ¬£1,150. The 1968 Meckering earthquake caused structural damage to the church's steeple. A decision was made to demolish the steeple but, when approximately 30 ft was removed, the remainder of the structure appeared secure and so a copper cone was placed on top to replace the damaged section. The bell was also removed from the tower as it was considered that the structure was too weak to support its weight. The bell was then mounted on display outside on the Hay Street side of the church. In 1974 redevelopment occurred on the north-west and south-west sides of the church site with the construction of the Wesley Arcade and Tower, which opened in May 1976. During these developments a small chapel was constructed at the north-west corner of the church. Wesley Church continued to be used as an active centre of worship and in 1977 the Methodist congregation joined the Uniting Church in Australia. In 1985 the Church launched a Restoration Fund through the National Trust of Australia (WA) to restore the external brick walls, gables, parapets and high part of the tower brickwork. Restoration works were finally completed in mid 1987. Current uses The church is currently the home of the Wesley worshipping community of the Uniting Church in the city, part of the Uniting Church in Australia. Heritage value The Wesley Church was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 23 March 1985 and classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 11 June 1973. On 23 May 1995 it was placed on the permanent State Heritage Register.

Before that, from its formation on 1 October 1928 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. Gau Southern Hanover-Brunswick was abolished after Germany's defeat in 1945. The territory after the war became part of Lower Saxony in West Germany. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau.

It premiered as part of the Kaaitheater Festival in May, 1983 at the Th√©√¢tre de la Balsamine, Brussels. Originally created with and danced by four dancers (Adriana Borriello, Fumiyo Ikeda, Mich√®le Anne De Mey, and Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker), it is now performed by a rotating cast from Rosas (the dance company formed by de Keersmaeker in 1983). Background Rosas danst Rosas was de Keersmaeker's third work, and the formative work for the company Rosas, which was founded in 1983. Thierry De Mey and de Keersmaeker had worked closely together on de Keersmaeker's previous work, Fase, and decided to compose a piece together. This meant that they had to write the music and the dance at the same time, rather than compose the dance to already existing music. De Mey's only prior experience of making music was as a guitar player with a rock band, and de Keersmaeker had choreographed Asch and Fase. De Keersmaker has stated that the most important connotation of the name Rosas, to her, is that \\"it refers to women, as the name Rosa is a woman's name. The title of the piece, \\"Rosas danst Rosas\\", meant we dance ourselves, and repetition was already contained in the title.\\" =Rosas= Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker created the dance and production team Rosas, and over the past 31 years the ensemble has won numerous awards and performed in many countries. Rosas describes its dance as \\"pure writing with movement in time and space\\" and says that \\"At its heart lies the relationship between movement and music. In some productions, the relationship between dance and text is also examined.\\" Structure It was by suggestion from De Mey that the dance was structured around the phases of a day. The first movement represents the nighttime, the second is the morning, and the third is afternoon. For the fourth movement, the dancers go into a kind of overdrive; as de Keersmaeker puts it, \\"The fourth movement is a paroxysm of dancing, dancing, dancing without counting, over and over again, a kind of d√©pense.\\" Over the course of the piece, the dancers split into many different combinations (e.g. 3-1, 1-2-1, 1-1-2, etc.), and become physically exhausted. Anne Teresa de Keersmaker herself stated that, \\"We exploit every possible division and combination of four dancers, also the space in straight lines, diagonals, and finally a closed circle.\\" Reception The piece has been described as many things; as Roslyn Sulcas wrote to the New York Times readership, \\"Riveting and exhausting, fascinating and relentless, brilliant and tedious, it is a mesmerizing exploration in synchronicity, patterning and rhythm.\\" Part of the reason for these contrasts is the very act that there is no exact 'right' or 'wrong' interpretation: it is what it is. This being the case, it is not uncommon for audience members to walk out of the performance, particularly during the first act, as the four women are rolling on the floor and utilizing repetitive movements. Luke Jennings, of the Observer, wrote that when de Keersmaeker launched her company in 1983, it was her musicality and \\"pure, dance minimalism\\" that won her attention, and that although 'Fase' \\"used repetition to an almost hallucinatory effect... Rosas danst Rosas remains the more confrontational of the two, retaining its power to baffle, frustrate, and intrigue.\\" Contributors and awards Choreography: Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker Music: Thierry De Mey, Peter Vermeersch Costumes: Rosas Awards: Bessie Awards for the light design (1987) and choreography (1987) in New York. The dance was also awarded the Eve du Spectacle by L'Association des Journalistes du Spectacle (1989). Film adaptions: Thierry De Mey filmed a screen adaption of the dance in 1997. This version was filmed in the old building of the technical school of architect Henry Van de Velde in Leuven. It is shorter than the actual stage production, and includes more members of the company than the usual four dancers. Plagiarism controversy In 2011 the pop star Beyonc√© was accused by Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker of plagiarizing dance moves from both Rosas danst Rosas (1983) and Achterland (1990). De Keersmaeker said in an interview, \\"I'm not mad, but this is plagiarism... This is stealing.' she later stated that 'It's a bit rude... What's rude is that they don't even bother about hiding it.' As James McKinley Jr. noted in his article for the New York Times, 'The dancer's in Beyonc√©'s video not only share some dance moves with the \\"Rosas danst Rosas\\" piece, but also the costumes, the set and even some specific shots resemble a film of the dance made by Thierry De May...' Beyonc√©'s response to de Keersmaeker's comments was 'Clearly, the ballet 'Rosas danst Rosas' was one of many references for my video 'Countdown'. It was one of the inspirations used to bring the feel and look of the song to life.' De Keersmaeker's initial response to the 'Countdown' video was as follows: De Keersmaeker stressed that she was not angry, and ended her statement by saying: References External links *Official website *Video of Rosas via UbuWeb *Full text of de Keersmaeker's response to Beyonc√©'s video Category:Contemporary dance Category:Group dances Category:Bessie Award winners ","title":"Rosas danst Rosas"},{"id":"18242284","text":"J√≥hannes Geir J√≥nsson (born 24. June 1927, d. 29. June 2003) was an Icelandic painter. He was born and raised in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur in northern Iceland. His father was a local schoolmaster; his much younger mother died from child labour when he was 9 years old. As a child J√≥hannes demonstrated a talent for drawing and painting. When the time came, he eventually persuaded his father to allow him to pursue his artistic interests rather than the academic career pre-planned for him. He studied art in Reykjav√≠k and subsequently in Copenhagen in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although he earned high remarks from his respected tutors, he initially had trouble making a living from his art after his homecoming, working mainly as an illustrator for advertisement agencies. He had trouble \\"finding his own style\\", and became depressive, which proved to be a blessing in disguise: Rather than painting the \\"classic\\" landscapes derivative of contemporary Icelandic artists, he began painting dark images from his youth in northern Iceland, seemingly haunted by the early loss of his mother and the strict (though caring) upbringing by his widowed father. Around 1965 the local art community started taking more notice of this little known young artist and his \\"dark, depressive\\" paintings. Art critics heaped praise on his works; this was quintessentially Icelandic art, but under obvious influence from the works of Edvard Munch or even Goya. Over the next few years he became one of the best known, best selling, and most respected painters in Iceland. Success also spelled the end of his \\"depressive era\\". Instead he turned his attention to painting Icelandic landscapes, but now with his unique unmistakable style - characterized with bright shining colours depicting (or amplifying) the beauty of a sometimes dull landscape. In the late 1970s, being an established successful artist, J√≥hannes could divide some attention to one of his lifelong interests - The Viking Sagas - and incorporate them into his art. For the rest of his life, he made hundreds of illustrations based on the Sagas, ranging all the way from grand oil paintings to small pencil sketches. Despite his failing health, J√≥hannes kept on working until his dying day. He was one of the most prolific Icelandic artists of his generation, and his works decorate the walls of many public buildings as well as private homes in Iceland.

He was acclaimed by audiences on both sides of the Atlantic for his exciting performances of Italian operatic works, especially those by Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini and the verismo composers.  Career  Cortis was born at sea but his birthplace is often given as Valencia, in which city he spent his infancy. (His name was originally Antonio Monton Corts but he changed it for theatrical purposes.) He studied music at the Royal Conservatory in Madrid and sang in a children's choir. In 1909, he and his widowed mother moved from Madrid to Barcelona, where he attended the local conservatory. He made his stage debut in 1912 at the Liceo in Barcelona as a comprimario singer, but he gradually worked his way up to major roles at a variety of opera houses in Spain and South America, including the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. On the South American tour of 1917, the young tenor was befriended by the Metropolitan Opera star Enrico Caruso, who encouraged him to pursue his singing career in New York City. Cortis declined Caruso's offer of help due to personal reasons but he would henceforth model his singing technique on Caruso's great example. His international career began in earnest with successful appearances in Naples and, more importantly, at Rome's Teatro Costanzi in 1920, where he signed a three-year contract. He proceeded to sing in Stockholm, Milan, Latin America and Berlin and, most famously, with the esteemed company at the Chicago Civic Opera from 1924 to 1932. His debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, occurred in 1931, as Calaf in Puccini's Turandot. He appeared often on the Italian opera-house circuit during the early 1930s but success at Milan's La Scala, with its entrenched roster of popular Italian-born tenors, eluded him. Cortis came to be regarded as one of the best inter-war interpreters of verismo opera. He was particularly praised for his performances of Calaf and of Dick Johnson in Puccini's La fanciulla del West, while he sang with remarkable ease the strenuous music composed for the tenor voice by Umberto Giordano and Pietro Mascagni. Cortis also undertook Verdi roles, such as the Duke in Rigoletto, which he delivered with impressive skill and style. He chose to spend the final phase of his career in Spain as the Great Depression deeply affected the economies of America and other parts of the world. Although his voice was still in good condition, he withdrew from the operatic stage in the mid-1930s. His decision to retire was influenced by the onset of the Spanish Civil War. He composed some vocal works during this period and founded a school for singers in Valencia in 1940. After World War II, he came out of retirement to appear occasionally in Spanish operas and other works. His health deteriorated in the early 1950s and he died at the age of 60 in Valencia.  Recordings and assessment  Cortis made a number of top-quality recordings of operatic arias and songs in 1925-1930, mainly for HMV but also for the Victor label. They consist of pieces by Gounod, Meyerbeer, Massenet, Donizetti, Verdi, Puccini, Giordano and Mascagni, and by Spanish composers such as Gaztambide, Vives and Serrano. (These recordings are now available on CD reissues, most notably those produced by the Pearl and Preiser companies.) For a public performer, Cortis possessed a comparatively reserved personality. This natural reticence may have prevented him from making the most of career opportunities when they presented themselves. Nevertheless, music critics consider his potent, dark-coloured voice to be one of the finest lyric-dramatic tenor instruments ever captured on disc. No mere 'belter', he sang with imagination and sound musicianship as well as thrilling tone.

Maginardo's career began in 1006-09, when he participated in the reconstruction of the eighth-century cathedral at Arezzo dedicated to Stephen the Protomartyr and the Virgin Mary. Maginardo's second great project was the addition of a chapel dedicated to Saint Donatus to the side of the cathedral. This building was finished in 1032 and dedicated on 12 November. In 1019 or 1026 Maginardo was sent to Ravenna by his bishop (probably Tedald) to study the Byzantine architecture of its monuments. He probably produced sketches of these monuments, but if so they do not survive. The result of his studies was a confluence of pre-romanesque styles: Aretine, Byzantine, and Lombard. This resulted in Maginardo's greatest work: the renovation of the old cathedral on the Pionta, a hill at the centre of Arezzo. This work lies in ruins today, since Cosimo I de' Medici ordered its destruction during his sack of 1561. References *Conant, Kenneth John (1978).

He competed primarily in promotions operated by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), like the Continental Wrestling Association and Georgia Championship Wrestling. Professional wrestling career =NWA Hollywood Wrestling (1968‚Äî1976)= Cash made his wrestling debut in 1968, competing for the National Wrestling Alliance affiliated Championship Wrestling from Florida. He wrestled both as a singles competitor and in tag team matches with partner Frank Hester. The following year, he began wrestling for a Los Angeles, California-based territory known as NWA Hollywood Wrestling. He soon won the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship by defeating John Tolos on March 22, 1974. After holding the belt for over two months, he dropped it to Black Gordman. In a rematch two weeks later, Cash regained the belt. Less than a month later, Ernie Ladd beat Cash to win the championship. After losing the title, Cash formed a tag team with Manny Soto. Together, they defeated Black Gordman and Goliath to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on July 24. The following month, Cash and Soto dropped the belts to the team of Angel Blanco and Dr. Wagner. Cash was involved in a feud with Butcher Brannigan, and he teamed with Victor Rivera to regain the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on September 14 by defeating Brannigan and Man Mountain Mike. They held the belts until a loss to Otto Von Heller and Kurt Von Hess October 12. The following year, Cash teamed with S.D. Jones to win the belts for a third time. They won the belts from Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts, collectively known as the Hollywood Blonds, but dropped the belts back to the Blonds the following month. Cash's final reign came in 1976, when he and Frank Monte defeated the team of Roddy Piper and Crusher Verdu for the belts. The reign was brief, however, as Cash and Monte soon dropped the belts to The Scorpions. =Southeastern United States= In 1976, Cash left California to compete in the Southeastern United States. Cash's first stop was Georgia, where he wrestled for Georgia Championship Wrestling. While there, he won the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship by teaming with Tom Jones to defeat Jimmy and Johnny Valiant. The following month, Cash and Jones lost the title to Gene and Ole Anderson. Cash also wrestled for Tennessee-based NWA Mid-America. He teamed with Gorgeous George, Jr. to win the Mid-America version of the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship in February 1977. In Louisiana, Cash became a two-time holder of the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. His first reign was with Mike George, as the team defeated The Medics (Billy Garrett and Jim Starr) on August 16, 1977. They held the belts for only a week, however, as they lost them in a rematch. Cash regained the belts in August 1977 from The Medics, this time with Dr. X as his partner. The team split up in September, however, and Cash and Dr. X faced each other for control of the title. Cash took Ray Candy as his partner, and Dr. X teamed with Cicl√≥n Negro. Negro and Dr. X won the match, bringing Cash's title reign to an end. =NWA Tri-State= Cash returned to Louisiana in 1981, although NWA Tri-State had been purchased by new owners. Cash regained the tag team title, which had since been renamed the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship, by teaming with Doug Somers to defeat Eric Embry and Chief Frank Hill. Once again, Cash's title reign ended because of a split from his partner, as Cash and Somers went their separate ways later that year. The following year saw Cash join Jim Crockett, Jr.'s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. Once again, he enjoyed success as a tag team competitor. Joining up with Jay Youngblood, he won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship in March 1982. After dropping the belts to Don Kernodle and Pvt. Jim Nelson, Cash formed a team with Iceman King Parsons to regain the title. In August, however, Cash once again lost the championship to Kernodle and Nelson. =Continental Wrestling Association= After leaving the Mid-Atlantic territory, Porkchop Cash then joined Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association based in Memphis, Tennessee. Cash soon formed a tag team with Troy Graham (who wrestled as \\"Dream Machine\\") known as The Bruise Brothers. Wrestling as heels, they held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship twice. The Bruise Brothers were in the First Family stable of Jimmy Hart. Their main rivals were The Sheepherders, a tag team from New Zealand. They beat Dutch Mantel and Koko B. Ware for their first title on October 3, 1983. They also had a series matches with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, trading the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship with them. A notable moment in the feud came after their match on November 7, 1983. Cash and Graham lost the match and the belts and responded by attacking the referee, Paul Morton (father of Ricky Morton of The Rock 'n' Roll Express). The Bruise Brothers avenged their loss one week later by regaining the championship. On November 29, 1983, The Bruise Brothers dropped the belts to The Fabulous Ones. Tension built within Hart's stable, and The Bruise Brothers faced stablemates The Grapplers (Len Denton and Tony Anthony) in a \\"losers no longer managed by Jimmy Hart\\" match on December 26. The Grapplers won, leaving Cash and Graham without a manager. Shortly thereafter, Cash replaced Graham with Maddog Boyd. Cash and Boyd initiated a feud with Eddie Gilbert by stealing a portrait of Gilbert that he had been showing off every week and offering to award to the winner of a draw. =Southeastern Championship Wrestling= Cash next moved to Ron Fuller's Southeastern Championship Wrestling, which operated throughout Alabama and the eastern half of Tennessee. He won his first singles title since 1974 when he defeated Boris Zhukov for the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship in September 1984. He held the title for two months before dropping it to Lord Humongous (portrayed by Jeff Van Kamp). He also won the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Jimmy Golden in January 1985. Two months later, he lost the belt to Boomer Lynch. =Central States Wrestling= After leaving Fuller's territory, Cash appeared next in Central States Wrestling in early 1987. He formed a team with Ken Timbs and challenged champions Rick McCord and Bart Batten for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship. Cash and Timbs appeared to win the title on April 3, 1987, but the title was declared vacant because Cash used a foreign object to get the victory. In a rematch on April 10, Cash and Timbs defeated McCord and Batten again to win the championship officially. Timbs eventually left the promotion, and the titles were vacated once again. Cash also briefly held the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship after defeating Rufus R. Jones, but he lost the belt in a rematch one week later. He then returned to tag team competition, joining up with Ric McCord to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship once again. They defeated The Batten Twins (Brad and Bart) for the belts on November 9, 1987 but lost the title to the Montana Cowboys (Mike Stone and Rick Patterson) on November 26. While working for NWA Central States, Cash also worked as a manager, calling himself \\"The Boss\\" Porkchop Cash while assisting wrestlers Russell Sapp and \\"Krusher\\" Karl Kovac. =World Wrestling Federation (1988)= Cash worked as enhancement talent for WWF between July and October 1988.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm =Universal Championship Wrestling= Not long after his stint in the Central States area, Cash remained close to the area working for Bert Prentice's Universal Championship Wrestling out of Wichita, KS. He would enter the territory to begin a feud with his former Central States tag-team partner Ric McCord over McCord's recently won North American Heavyweight title. Porkchop would also feud with Rufus R. Jones and his nephew Boogaloo Jones, sometimes teaming up with fellow heel, and Dusty Rhodes lookalike Randy Rhodes. Porkchop would win the North American Championship from Ric McCord in November 1990, losing it back to McCord a few weeks later. Semi-retirement Several years later, Porkchop Cash came out of retirement to do a special three-way tag match with the Rock and Roll Express and the Midnight Express. His tag team partner was former rival Koko B. Ware, and the pair formed the PYT Express. On January 21, 2005, Cash defeated The Psycho to win the NWA Mississippi Cruiserwight Championship. He held the belt for over a year before dropping it to Brother Love (not to be confused with the character portrayed by World Wrestling Entertainment's Bruce Prichard). Porkchop Cash is now semi-retired but still wrestles on occasional independent shows. Legacy Floyd Womack of the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks received the nickname \\"Pork Chop Womack\\" from his mother because she thought that her son looked like Porkchop Cash.

He was the second director of the University of New South Wales from 1953, continuing as vice-chancellor when the position's title was changed in 1955. Under his administration, the university grew from its technical college roots into the \\"fastest growing and most rapidly diversifying tertiary institution in Australia\\". Philip Baxter College is named in his honour. Baxter was born in Wales, but grew up in England, entering the University of Birmingham at age 16. He joined Imperial Chemical Industries as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in Widnes, investigating the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. He was elected to the Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project. Baxter was recruited by the then-New South Wales University of Technology as a professor of chemical engineering in 1949. He became one of the most prolific public advocates of nuclear power for Australia. He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973. Early life John Philip Baxter was born in Machynlleth in Wales on 7 May 1905, the younger child of John Baxter and his wife Mary Netta Morton. He had an older sister, Muriel. His father was a telegraphist with the British Post Office, as was his mother before her marriage. The family moved to Hereford in England, where he attended Hereford High School for Boys. At school, he enjoyed playing tennis. Baxter passed the Northern Universities Matriculation examination when he was 14, but found that this was too young to be admitted to a university. He passed it again the following year, and then passed the University of London Matriculation examination the year after, when he was 16, after which he was permitted to enter the University of Birmingham. He was interested in metallurgy and enrolled in a science course. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree with first class honours in 1925, and his Master of Science the following year. His main form of recreation remained tennis. With the help of a ¬£250 per annum James Watt research scholarship, he wrote his 1928 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis on \\"The combustion of carbonic oxide\\", under the supervision of F. H. Burstall. Imperial Chemical Industries A recommendation from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory had been established to make sodium hydroxide. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, who worked as a stenographer in nearby Stockton-on- Tees. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, Alexander Fleck had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick. The Central Laboratory's focus at this time was on the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. Electrolysis of salt water produced chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), but there was not as much demand for the chlorine, so ICI was eager to create new products using chlorine that it could sell. New products that were created included various solvents, chlorinated rubber, and Lindane, an insecticide developed in collaboration with ICI's Agricultural Research Station at Jealott's Hill. Baxter personally received a number of patents for his work. He became Research Manager of the General Chemicals Division in 1935. He reorganised the Central Laboratory into seven sections, each with its own Assistant Research Manager, an organisational structure known as \\"Baxter and the seven dwarves\\", which was not generally considered a success at the time. In addition to his scientific work, Baxter was involved in local politics. He was elected to the Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. He was leader of the Conservative Party in the Council, and chairman of the local party organisation in the Widnes UK Parliament constituency. Tube Alloys In 1940, with Britain at war during the Second World War, Baxter was approached by physicist James Chadwick, who asked if he could supply a sample of uranium hexafluoride. Baxter did so on a personal basis, using research money. Chadwick then came back and asked Baxter if he could supply a much larger amount, about . This time, Baxter demurred. The production of such a large quantity would require the purchase of additional equipment. ICI's hydrofluoric acid plant was out of commission and would require repairs. The bill for that amount of uranium hexafluoride would therefore come to around ¬£3,000, a sum that he could not spend from research funds. He would require permission from senior ICI management, who would want to know if it would assist the war effort and whether 3 kg was all that would be required, or if further orders could be expected. Chadwick then revealed that this was part of a secret project, codenamed Tube Alloys, the object of which was to build an atomic bomb. Permission from ICI management was secured by Frederick Lindemann making a direct approach to Lord Melchett, one of ICI's directors. ICI pilot plants for producing of pure uranium metal and of uranium hexafluoride per diem commenced operation in Widnes in mid-1943. The following year, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, Baxter was sent to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for three months to assist the Manhattan Project. The electromagnetic separation process had problems with the efficiency of its chemical processes for uranium recovery. At the request of the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., Baxter subsequently returned to Oak Ridge for an indefinite period, this time with his family. He became the personal assistant to the general manager, with responsibility for coordinating research, development and production activities. For his wartime nuclear weapons work, Baxter was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1946. Officer of the Order of the British Empire Baxter returned to Widnes as Research Director of the General Chemicals Division after the war ended in 1945. He became a director of Thorium Ltd, a company half owned by ICI that was involved in the production of radioactive substances, and was a consultant to the British nuclear energy program. His General Chemicals Division at Widnes was involved in chemical separation of uranium products, which he considered a patriotic duty. Baxter was personally responsible for the research and development that was the basis for the design of the Springfields uranium hexafluoride plant, and was a member of the committee that oversaw the construction of the chemical separation plant to extract plutonium. Much to Baxter's disappointment, ICI management did not see nuclear energy as being part of its core mission, and disengaged from it. He also became dismayed at political and economic developments in the United Kingdom after the Conservatives lost office in 1945. University of New South Wales Atomic scientists from fifteen nations meet for a conference at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment at Lucas Heights in 1966. (left to right) , Baxter and Robert Street. In 1949, Baxter heard that the New South Wales University of Technology was looking for a professor of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside for the rest of his life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well- organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England. A number of other professors disliked the name and organisational structure of the university, and wanted it to shake off the association with \\"technology\\" and become a \\"real university\\". While Baxter did not side with them, contending that the university's association with the government provided funding and facilities, most of what he did moved in that direction. He hired full-time staff, and broadened the scope of the subjects taught and the research carried out. A Department of Food Technology was the first, and for many years the only, one of its kind in Australia. He replaced the diploma-level with a new bachelor of science in chemical engineering degree, offering conversion courses to allow students to upgrade their diplomas to degrees. The first chemical engineering students had enrolled in 1949, and nine graduated with the bachelor of science degree in 1952. The School of Chemical Engineering became the first school to relocate to the new campus in Kensington in 1953. In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He defeated Arthur Denning in an election for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as a victory for the proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice- chancellor. During a two-day symposium on \\"Atomic Power in Australia\\" at the New South Wales University of Technology, Sydney, which began on 31 August 1954, Professors Marcus Oliphant (left), Homi Jehangir Bhabha (centre) and Philip Baxter, meet over a cup of tea A committee appointed by the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change its name to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject. In Baxter's eyes, the main role of the university was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was far short of the university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but even more so when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959. Baxter's biggest clashes with academic staff were over governance issues. He had a preference for industry- style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away with the election of deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean who was in charge of administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as \\"unusual, undemocratic and unacademic\\". His successor, Rupert Myers, declared that: \\"History will show Sir Philip Baxter to have been a great educational administrator who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community.\\" Atomic knight Nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights under construction On 19 August 1949, the Australian government created the Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee, chaired by Mark Oliphant and with Baxter as a member, to advise government on the development of nuclear power in Australia. On the committee's own recommendation, it was superseded by the Atomic Energy Policy Committee in April 1952. This in turn was replaced by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) in November. The AAEC was run by a three commissioners, with Jack Stevens as chairman, Baxter as vice-chairman and Hugh Murray from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company as the third member. Baxter succeeded Stevens as chairman in 1957. He worked part-time, spending Fridays at the AAEC until he retired from the UNSW in 1969. Thereafter he was full-time, until he retired from the AAEC on 15 April 1972. He was also the Australian member on the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency when it was created in 1957 and again from 1964 to 1972, serving as its chairman from 1969 to 1970. The AAEC established its offices in Coogee. Baxter and Frederick White from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) visited nuclear facilities in Britain, the United States and Canada in 1953. As there were few people in Australia with nuclear technology experience, he arranged with Sir John Cockcroft for Australians to be seconded to the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell. Some 60 Australian scientists were working there by 1956. During a symposium on \\"Atomic Power in Australia\\" held at the New South Wales University of Technology on 31 August and 1 September 1954, Baxter clashed with Harry Messel, the head of the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, over the latter's plans to build a low-power experimental nuclear reactor. Nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights completed Baxter would have none of it; he wanted a \\"real reactor, not a low-power toy\\". He prevailed; the government authorised a High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR). Based on the DIDO reactor at Harwell, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by heavy water, and fuelled with enriched uranium. Construction began at Lucas Heights in October 1955, and HIFAR went critical on 26 January 1958. By the time he became full-time chairman in 1969, the AAEC had grown to an organisation with a staff of over 1,000 and a budget of $8.5 million. The AAEC explored the country looking for uranium deposits, developed technology for uranium enrichment, and produced designs for nuclear reactors. More controversially, Baxter pressed the case for Australia to have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons. In 1958, he proposed creating a facility at Mount Isa to breed weapons-grade plutonium. His proposals found a sympathetic ear in Prime Minister John Gorton, who approved plans to build a CANDU reactor at Jervis Bay in 1969. An access road was built and ground was cleared, but Gorton lost office on 10 March 1971, and the project was suspended, and later cancelled by his successors. Nailing his colours to the mast, Baxter continued his advocacy. In 1975 he declared: For his work as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Baxter was made a Companion Order of St Michael and St George in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 1959, and was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Civil Division in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours on 12 June 1965. Arts and legacy The Sydney Opera House Baxter had been a member of the drama group in Stockton-on-Tees, and had performed on stage with University Drama Club at UNSW, sometimes with his daughter Valerie. In response to a request from the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1958 for improved training of actors, he founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). By 2013, NIDA was regarded as one of the world's finest drama schools, with alumni that included Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis, Mel Gibson, Baz Luhrmann and Hugo Weaving. From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was part-time and unpaid chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, J√∏rn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973. Baxter was awarded honorary doctorates by Montreal University in 1958, the University of Newcastle in 1966, the University of Queensland in 1967, Loughborough University in 1970 and the UNSW in 1971. Philip Baxter College at the UNSW was named after him in 1966. He died in Haberfield on 5 September 1989, and his remains were cremated. He was survived by three of his children; his wife Lilian had died on 27 July 1989, and his son Peter had died in a motor vehicle accident in the 1960s. His papers are in the archives at the University of New South Wales.

Based on the book Triumph Over Pain (1940) by Ren√© F√ºl√∂p-Miller, it tells the story of Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, a 19th-century Boston dentist who discovered the use of ether for general anesthesia. The film stars Joel McCrea and Betty Field, and features Harry Carey, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Porter Hall. The movie was filmed in 1942 but not released for over two years, and the released version differed from what Preston Sturges had wished, although he publicly accepted the film as his own. Paramount Pictures disliked the film Sturges had made, and pulled it from his control, re-titled and re-edited it, in the process making it (especially in the early segment) more confusing for the audience to understand. The studio's released version was marketed in a way that made it appear to be one of Sturges' comedies. The film was not well received by the critics or the public, and marked the end of a sustained run of success for Sturges, who had already left Paramount by the time the film was released.TCM NotesNixon, Rick \\"The Great Moment\\" (TCM article) Although rarely seen today, the film is worth viewing for its flashback structure - comparable in some ways to Citizen Kane, which was influenced by the earlier film The Power and the Glory (1933), for which Sturges wrote the screenplay - and for its irreverent and subtly satirical tone, unusual for a time when most Hollywood biopics were over- inflated and sentimental. In 2003, a medical-dental historian in a lengthy analysis of the movie and its history‚Äîwhich cited its flashback structure, timeless subject, injections of humor, and \\"un-Pasteur-like\\" treatment of its protagonist, while adhering reasonably well to the historical record‚Äîconcluded that \\"The Great Moment may now be due for a general reevaluation by movie historians and critics who, like most folks, have never felt much affection for dentists past and present.\\"Frank Heynick 2003 \\"William T.G. Morton and 'The Great Moment.'\\" Journal of the History of Dentistry, 51(1), p. 35 Plot (The version as released by the studio)Heynick op cit., pp. 29-31, which contains a more extensive and detailed plot summary The titles and credits open with a scene (in 1846) of a triumphant street procession and a jubilant crowd hailing William Morton (Joel McCrea) with signs such as \\"Pain is no more,\\" followed by a long, written prologue pointing out, in part, that \\"before ether there was nothing.\\" Next, an old Eben Frost (William Demarest) is seen heading through the snow to the farmhouse of Morton's aging widow Lizzie (Betty Field). On the way he stops at a pawn shop and redeems a medal once awarded to Morton inscribed: \\"To the benefactor of mankind.\\" At the Morton home, Lizzie reminisces to Frost about her late husband and their life together, although the nature of Morton's achievement is vague. In the brief first flashback (which takes place several years after his discovery, though this is not at all clear), Morton mortgages his farm to pay for a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet President Franklin Pierce (Porter Hall). The president declares his intention to ratify a large monetary sum awarded to Morton by a grateful Congress, but says Morton should first legitimize his claim in court by filing a patent infringement suit against some army or navy doctor. The newspapers loudly denounce Morton's greed, the court declares his discovery unpatentable, and Morton runs amok in a shop which is capitalizing on his discovery with no credit or royalties to him. The scene shifts back to the farmhouse and the aging Lizzie, who relates the details of the broken Morton's recent death and their life together before, during, and immediately after Morton's discovery. The second flashback, which makes up most of the story, follows Morton and Lizzie's courtship, early married years, and his tribulations as a dentist with patients who fear the pain of dental operations. Morton consults his former professor Charles T. Jackson (Julius Tannen), who cantankerously suggests cooling the gums and roots with topical application of chloric ether. Morton ignorantly purchases a bottle of sulphuric ether and passes out when it evaporates in the living room of his home. Morton's former partner Horace Wells later comes by, telling of his discovery that nitrous oxide (laughing gas, which in those days was used at carnival attractions) could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic. He asks Morton's assistance at a planned tooth extraction at Harvard Medical School before the class of prominent surgeon John Collins Warren (Harry Carey). The demonstration fails (or appears to) when the patient cries out. Wells remains convinced of nitrous oxide's efficacy, but soon swears it off when his next patient almost fails to revive from an overdose. Morton, thinking back to his passing out from inadvertently inhaling sulphuric ether vapor, wonders whether this instead could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic. He tries the gas on patient Frost, who goes berserk. Morton consults Jackson, who explains that the ether must be of the highly rectified type. The next trial with Frost succeeds. Morton, who is camouflaging the smell of the sulphuric ether and calling it \\"Letheon,\\" is soon raking in a fortune with his painless dentistry. However, Jackson and Wells now accuse Morton of having stolen their respective ideas. Morton begins thinking about the possible use of his \\"Letheon\\" in general surgery. He approaches surgeon Warren, who is highly skeptical but agrees to a demonstration at Massachusetts General Hospital. The operation (on October 16, 1846), the excising of a neck tumor before doctors and students in the operating theater, proceeds painlessly. Warren now schedules a public demonstration for a more serious operation‚Äîa leg amputation. On the scheduled day, representatives of the state Medical Society, jealous of the success of this upstart dentist, demand that, in accordance with established medical ethics, Morton first reveal the chemical composition of his \\"Letheon.\\" Morton refuses to do so until his pending patent is granted, but says that in the meantime he will let all hospitals and charitable institutions (though not his rival dentists) use his compound free of charge. The Medical Society's men declare this unacceptable, so surgeon Warren says he has no alternative but to perform the scheduled amputation without anesthesia. As the bewildered Morton wanders through the hospital corridors, he comes across the girl whose leg is to amputated, being prayed over by a priest. Taking pity on her, he marches into the operating theater to reveal his secret to surgeon Warren‚Äîand to the world.

Production The saga of The Great Moment - which during various stages of its development was called \\"Immortal Secret,\\" \\"Great Without Glory,\\" \\"Morton the Magnificent\\" and \\"Triumph Over Pain\\" - begins in 1939, with a screenplay for Paramount Pictures about the life of W.T.G. Morton, written by Preston Sturges, Irwin Shaw, Les River, Charles Brackett and Waldo Twitchell. The film was to be directed by Henry Hathaway, produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and William LeBaron, with Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan to star as Morton and Eben Frost. When Cooper left Paramount, production was delayed, although there may have been other reasons as well. It's unlikely that any footage was actually shot at that time, but Paramount did go so far as to check with historians and dental organizations to confirm the screenplay's depiction of Morton, finding that opinion was divided on his character and on his claim to have discovered the first practical anesthesia. In fact, when Rene Fulop-Miller's book Triumph over Pain was published in 1940, it caused a storm of controversy, as many disputed its claims regarding Morton. It is now recognized that Dr. Crawford Long's use of ether predated Dr. Morton's use, although Morton is credited for widely publicizing the technique. Paramount executives were losing interest in the project, but Sturges had become enthralled by it, seeing an opportunity to combine the themes of sacrifice, triumph and tragedy with elements of madcap, satire and the fickleness of fate and luck. Sturges' commercial and critical success was such that the studio executives, though sceptical of the Morton movie, were willing to indulge him and let him direct it if at the same time he would keep turning out the kind of films which were proven hits.Heynick op cit., p. 28; further background is given in: Preston Sturges 1995 Four More Screenplays by Preston Sturges, University of California Press; James Curtis 1982 Between Flops: A Biography of Preston Sturges, Brace Jovanovich; Diane Jacobs 1992 Christmas in July: The Life and Art of Preston Sturges, University of California Press; Preston Sturges 1990 Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges: His Life and Words, Simon & Schuster; Donald Spoto 1990 Madcap: The Life of Preston Sturges, Little, Brown; James Ursini 1973 The Fabulous Life and Times of Preston Sturges an American Dreamer, Curtis Books. Paramount bought the rights to an MGM short film Life of William Morton, Discoverer of Anesthesia, which is not credited in the released film as a source. Sturges then revised the 1939 screenplay with Ernst Laemmle, whose work was uncredited. At that time, Walter Huston was being considered to play the lead. The film went into production on 8 April 1942 and wrapped on 5 June, on budget and a day under schedule.TCM Overview (In the sequence of Sturges' films, that's after the filming of The Palm Beach Story but before its release, and before both The Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Hail the Conquering Hero began shooting.) Joel McCrea, who had just starred in The Palm Beach Story played Morton - McCrea told Sturges that he only gained good roles when Gary Cooper was unavailable - and William Demarest played Eben Frost, giving a \\"gem of a performance\\" in one of his \\"strongest and most important roles\\".Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Sturges explained his unusual choice of having his two flashbacks in reverse chronological order (the first flashback telling, however briefly, of episodes in Morton's life post-discovery and post-sacrifice, then the second, much longer flashback telling of his life up to and including his discovery and sacrifice) as follows: \\"Unfortunately, I was not around in 1846 to direct Dr. Morton's life. [...] Since [a director-biographer with integrity] cannot change the chronology of events, he can only change the order of their presentation. Dr. Morton's life, as lived, was a very bad piece of dramatic construction. He had a few months of exictement ending in triumph and twenty years of disillusionment, boredom, and increasing bitterness.\\"Heynick op cit., p. 31; from Curtis op cit., p. 172. Sturges' edits In the process of adapting and shooting the script, Sturges himself made a few interesting changes. An earlier version had young student Morton and his fianc√©e Lizzie engaging in ether frolics at a party (not uncommon in that era, though F√ºl√∂p-Miller's book does not say that Morton himself ever did so). Sturges decided it would be more appropriate to have Morton introduced cold to ether as a dentist.Heynick op cit., p. 33. More significant was the change Sturges decided to make at the very end. In a previous script, as Morton enters the operating theater to reveal the secret of his anesthetic to Dr. Warren and the world, there was to be dialogue between them (hesitation ellipses in original): Morton: \\"Professor Warren, it's called ... sulphuric ether ... highly rectified.\\" Prof. Warren: (Stupefied) \\"You mean plain C2H5OC2H5?\\" Morton: (He lifts his arms helplessly) \\"I don't know ... I guess so.\\" Warren: (Seizing his hands) \\"Oh, my boy ... my boy.\\"Heynick op cit., p. 34, in Sturges 1995 op cit., p. 526. Sturges decided to eliminate this dialogue, since although it made a point which Sturges indeed wished to make, it did it too well. The Morton story particularly intrigued Sturges because it contrasted with recent highly successful medical biopics by Warner Bros.: The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936) and Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet (1940). Sturges wished to eschew (in his words) the \\"traditional smugness\\" of the \\"hand-in- the-bosom-prematurely-turned-to-marble form of biography,\\" the \\"Pasteur manner, where every character knows his place in History.\\"Heynick op cit.,p. 31; from Curtis op cit., p. 330. Morton as presented is an un-Pasteur. He has no delusions of scientific genius or pre-determined destiny. Not only is Morton's great discovery aided by serendipity (as can often happen in the lives of geniuses, too); it is abetted in large measure by his scientific ignorance, an ignorance which also afforded Sturges the chance to inject some madcap humor (as when Morton's first test patient goes berserk). However, Sturges decided simply to eliminate the original dialogue with Prof. Warren when Morton marches (to the sound of trumpets) into the operating theater, since by emphasizing yet again Morton's scientific limitations this would detract from the power of the climactic sacrifice he was making.Thus, Sturges unambiguousy presented Morton as morally a (tragic) hero. Some historians point, however, to Morton's record of dubious, even illegal, financial dealings and dispute the magnitude of the role he claimed in the discovery of the use of ether for general anesthesia. Especially scathing is Richard J. Wolfe (2001 Tarnished Idol: William Thomas Green Morton and the Introduction of Surgical Anesthesia, Norman Publishing), who basically comes down on the side of rival claimants Wells and Jackson -- and of Morton's denouncers, who are villainous in the movie. Studio edits Paramount did not immediately release the film, because they disliked the non-sequential arrangement of the scenes, the tone of some of the acting, and the prologue. The film was taken away from Sturges by executive producer Buddy G. DeSylva, who never quite trusted him and resented the control Sturges had over his projects, and found the Morton story unsuitable for mainstream audiences. Sturges had shot the prologue as a voice-over to open the film: > One of the most charming characteristics of Homo sapiens, the wise guy on > your right, is the consistency with which he has stoned, crucified, hanged, > flayed, boiled in oil and otherwise rid himself of those who consecrated > their lives to further his comfort and well-being, so that all his strength > and cunning might be preserved for the erection of ever larger monuments, > memorial shafts, triumphal arches, pyramids and obelisks to the eternal > glory of generals on horseback, tyrants, usurpers, dictators, politicians, > and other heroes who led him, from the rear, to dismemberment and death. > This is the story of the Boston dentist who gave you ether-before whom in > all time surgery was agony, since whom science has control of pain. It > should be almost unnecessary then to tell you that this man, whose > contribution to human mercy is unparalleled in the history of the world, was > ridiculed, reviled, burned in effigy and eventually driven to despair and > death by the beneficiaries of his revelation. Paramount Pictures, > Incorporated, has the honor of bringing you, at long last, the true story of > an American of supreme achievement - W.T.G. Morton of Boston, Massachusetts, > in a motion picture called Triumph Over Pain. This prologue was deemed by the studio to be inopportune during World War Two. The film as released now opens with this prologue, in titles rather than voice-over, written by Sturges when it was clear that no satisfactory revision to the original prologue was feasible: > It does not seem to be generally understood that before ether there was > nothing. The patient was strapped down...that is all. This is the story of > W. T. G. Morton of Boston, Mass., before whom in all time surgery was agony, > since whom science has control of pain.This line, which remains from the > original prologue, is taken from the epitaph on Morton's tombstone. Of all > things in nature great men alone reverse the laws of perspective and grow > smaller as one approaches them. Dwarfed by the magnitude of his revelation, > reviled, hated by his fellow men, forgotten before he was remembered, Morton > seems very small indeed until the incandescent moment he ruined himself for > a servant girl and gained immortality. The film was heavily re-cut, to the point that some of the narrative became almost incomprehensible. Eliminated from the re-cut version was a brief sequence which preceded even the framing story with Frost and widow Lizzie. This initial sequence shifted back and forth between a scene of child in a contemporary hospital (early 1940s) being wheeled into the operating room and being assured by his parents that the operation will not hurt and a scene of a broken and impoverished Morton in the previous century pawning his medals.Heynick op cit., p. 32. The first flashback sequence was cut particularly heavily by the studio, since it was not only chronologically subsequent to the second flashback, but also was almost totally devoid of humor. The most significant segment eliminated from the first flashback was Morton's confession to Lizzie on the evening after his sacrifice, which would have appeared very early in the sequence. It reads in part (hesitation ellipses in original): Morton: \\"[T]oday at the hospital ... the Medical Society wouldn't let them use the Letheon ... unless they knew what it was so ... they asked me what it was.\\" Mrs Morton: (Staccato and smiling, on the verge of hysteria) \\"But you didn't just tell them ...\\" (She twists her hands) \\"... I mean you weren't such a fool as to tell them the most valuable secret in the world, JUST FOR THE ASKING?\\" Morton: (Miserably) \\"But Lizzie they were going to take her leg off without it ... without anything!\\" (He seems on the verge of hysteria himself) \\"They were just going to strap her down and hack it off!\\" Mrs. Morton: (Vehemently) \\"Whose leg?\\" Morton: (With a trace of exasperation) \\"I don't know ... some servant girl!\\"Heynick op cit., p. 33, in Sturges 1995 op cit., p. 381. The studio was concerned that revealing the nature of Morton's sacrifice so early in the movie would lessen the dramatic impact of that sacrifice at the climax. The downside of the elimination of this scene was, however, that the audience was all the less aware of how the remaining events in the first flashback sequence, especially as further whittled down by the studio, related to the story. (The reference in the prologue to Morton's having \\"ruined himself for a servant girl\\" is left hanging and would seem to point to, if anything, some illicit affair.) The second flashback (which forms the great majority of the film) was left comparably intact, for it was the traditional linear narrative with which the Hollywood film industry was most comfortable. Particularly, the humorous and slapstick episodes, which Paramount felt that audiences expected from a Sturges film, were preserved‚Äîso much so that Sturges suspected the film was being \\"cut for comedy.\\"Heynick op cit., p.33, from Sturges 1995 op cit., p. 329. The title was changed over Sturges' strong objections‚Äîunclear is whether the \\"great moment\\" refers to the first ether operation or Morton's sacrifice at the climax. (Because of the re-editing, the film is listed with various runtimes of 80, 83, 87, and 90 minutes, and some of the actors listed in official cast lists may not actually appear in the film.) At some point in this process, Sturges' contract with Paramount ran out, and he left the studio (although he came back to do some unpaid re-shooting and re-editing of Hail the Conquering Hero) Sturges later wrote about his departure \\"I guess Paramount was glad to be rid of me eventually, as no one there ever understood a word I said.\\" The Great Moment premiered in Los Angeles on August 24, 1944, more than two years after filming had wrapped, and went into general release on September 6 of that year.IMDB Release dates The film was not well-received, either by the critics or at the box-office, becoming the only film directed by Sturges for Paramount not to turn a profit. Sturges' reputation never quite recovered from its failure, and his post-Paramount career is the record of a sad decline. The Great Moment was released on video in the U.S. on November 11, 1990 and re-released on June 30, 1993. It was released on Laserdisc on October 26, 1994.TCM Misc. notes See also *List of American films of 1944 Notes External links  * Category:1944 films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American black-and- white films Category:Films about dentistry Category:Films scored by Victor Young Category:Films directed by Preston Sturges Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by Preston Sturges Category:Films based on biographies Category:1940s biographical drama films Category:1944 drama films ","title":"The Great Moment (1944 film)"},{"id":"18243350","text":"Sir Rupert Horace Myers, (21 February 1921 ‚Äì 21 February 2019) was an Australian metallurgist, academic and university administrator, who was the third vice-chancellor of the University of New South Wales from 1969 to 1981.

Havana harbor is the port of Havana, the capital of Cuba, and it is the main port in Cuba (not including Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, a territory on lease by the United States). Other port cities in Cuba include Cienfuegos, Matanzas, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. The harbor was created from the natural Havana Bay. It is entered through a narrow inlet and divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar√©s. History The waters of Havana Harbor, showing Old Havana at night. It was fortified by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century who in 1553 transferred the governor's residence to Havana from Santiago de Cuba on the eastern end of the island, thus making Havana the de facto capital. The importance of these fortifications was early recognized as English, French, and Dutch sea marauders attacked the city in the 16th century.Old Havana Later fortifications included the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Caba√±a, known as La Caba√±a or Fort of Saint Charles, built in the 18th- century on the elevated eastern side of the harbor entrance as the largest fortress complex in the Americas. The fort rises above the 200-foot (60 m) hilltop, beside Morro Castle. Castillo de la Real Fuerza and San Salvador de la Punta Fortress, both constructed in sixteenth century, sit on the western side of the harbor in Old Havana. The Battle of Havana was a two-month siege of the harbor defenses by the British in 1762. =USS Maine= Maine explosion. The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, \\"Effects of the Press on Spanish‚ÄìAmerican Relations in 1898\\" Map of Havana Harbor, 1888 Havana Harbor - 1898 In January 1898 the USS Maine, the largest vessel to come out of an American shipyard, was dispatched to Cuba to protect US interests there. At the time more than 8,000 US citizens resided in the country, and their safety could not be assured in the state of affairs at that time. On February 15, 1898 the Maine exploded and sank in the harbor. It became a major rallying call for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and it caused the US to finally intercede on Cuba's behalf. In 1912 the wreck was removed from the harbor as it was posing a hazard to navigation. It was sunk in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico with proper military ceremonies.The MaineUS Navy History =La Coubre= On March 4, 1960, the harbor was the scene of a deadly explosion when the French freighter La Coubre, carrying 76 tons of Belgian munitions, was being unloaded. The cause of the blast, which killed an estimated 100 people, is often attributed to the CIA who wished to overthrow the new government of Fidel Castro.Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy J. Naftali.

It receives approximately 48,000 m3 of waste water per day, which carries about 4,800 kg of nitrogen and 1,200 kg of phosphorus, which results in elevated concentrations of nutrients. Havana Bay is strongly affected by sewage dumping, and it also receives suspended solids, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and pollutants from agriculture, industry and port activities. The leading sources of pollution in the bay have been identified as the Luyano River which contains organic material, nutrients, sewage, solid waste,Michael Martinez, \\"In Cuba, a hard river to clean\\", Chicago Tribune, September 25, 2007 the Regla oil refinery, fish hatcheries, and port activities. The high concentration of hydrocarbons, heavy metals and other pollutants is of concern as the harbor is an important fishing port.

Scope Arithmetic combinatorics is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additive combinatorics is the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved. Ben Green explains arithmetic combinatorics in his review of \\"Additive Combinatorics\\" by Tao and Vu. Important results =Szemer√©di's theorem= Szemer√©di's theorem is a result in arithmetic combinatorics concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. In 1936, Erd≈ës and Tur√°n conjectured. that every set of integers A with positive natural density contains a k term arithmetic progression for every k. This conjecture, which became Szemer√©di's theorem, generalizes the statement of van der Waerden's theorem. =Green‚ÄìTao theorem and extensions= The Green‚ÄìTao theorem, proved by Ben Green and Terence Tao in 2004,. states that the sequence of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In other words there exist arithmetic progressions of primes, with k terms, where k can be any natural number. The proof is an extension of Szemer√©di's theorem. In 2006, Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler extended the result to cover polynomial progressions.. More precisely, given any integer-valued polynomials P1,..., Pk in one unknown m all with constant term 0, there are infinitely many integers x, m such that x + P1(m), ..., x + Pk(m) are simultaneously prime. The special case when the polynomials are m, 2m, ..., km implies the previous result that there are length k arithmetic progressions of primes. Example If A is a set of N integers, how large or small can the sumset :A+A := \\\\\\\\{x+y: x,y \\\\in A\\\\\\\\}, the difference set :A-A := \\\\\\\\{x-y: x,y \\\\in A\\\\\\\\}, and the product set :A\\\\cdot A := \\\\\\\\{xy: x,y \\\\in A\\\\\\\\} be, and how are the sizes of these sets related? (Not to be confused: the terms difference set and product set can have other meanings.) Extensions The sets being studied may also be subsets of algebraic structures other than the integers, for example, groups, rings and fields.

Together with Joseph von Baader (1763‚Äì1835) and Baron Theodor Freiherr von Cramer-Klett (1817‚Äì1884), Maffei was one of the three most important railway pioneers in Bavaria. Early life Joseph Anton Maffei was born in Munich, the son of an Italian tradesman from Verona. The Palazzo Maffei still stands today on the Piazza delle Erbe. His father came to Munich in order to run a tobacco wholesale business, that Joseph Anton Maffei continued. In 1835 Maffei was one of the founding shareholders of the Bavarian Mortgage and Discount Bank (Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank). Railway pioneer J. A. Maffei's 500th locomotive In 1836 Maffei founded the locomotive firm of J. A. Maffei in the English Garden in Munich. His desire was to make Bavaria competitive in the field of industrial engines. From small beginnings, a locomotive factory of world renown arose. Maffei, amongst others, also championed the construction of the railway line from Munich to Augsburg and supported Johann Ulrich Himbsel in building the private railway from Munich to Starnberg. In 1864 the 500th locomotive was delivered. Other achievements In 1851 Maffei supplied the first steamer, the Maximilian, for boat services on Lake Starnberg. By 1926 there were 44 steamships. Maffei was also a city councillor (Magistratsrat) in Munich and busied himself e.g. with the construction of the famous hotel, the Bayerischer Hof. Death Maffei died in Munich. Maffei's legacy Joseph Anton Ritter von Maffei died on 1 September 1870. His grave may still be found today at the Old Southern Cemetery (Alter S√ºdfriedhof) in Munich. The locomotive works he founded survived him by some 60 years, but in 1930 J. A. Maffei went bankrupt and was amalgamated with the firm of Krauss in 1930 to form Krauss-Maffei. Today, Villa Maffei in Feldafing (on Lake Starnberg) houses a museum and exhibitions. Origin of the Maffei family The surname von Maffei or Maffei is a patronymic name derived from the personal name Matth√§us (German). In ancient times the Maffei family settled in Verona from Germany.

One major area of study in additive combinatorics are inverse problems: given the size of the sumset A + B is small, what can we say about the structures of A and B? In the case of the integers, the classical Freiman's theorem provides a partial answer to this question in terms of multi-dimensional arithmetic progressions. Another typical problem is to find a lower bound for A + B in terms of A and B. This can be viewed as an inverse problem with the given information that A+B is sufficiently small and the structural conclusion is then of the form that either A or B is the empty set; however, in literature, such problems are sometimes considered to be direct problems as well. Examples of this type include the Erd≈ës‚ÄìHeilbronn Conjecture (for a restricted sumset) and the Cauchy‚ÄìDavenport Theorem. The methods used for tackling such questions often come from many different fields of mathematics, including combinatorics, ergodic theory, analysis, graph theory, group theory, and linear algebraic and polynomial methods.  History of additive combinatorics  Although additive combinatorics is a fairly new branch of combinatorics (in fact the term additive combinatorics was coined by Terence Tao and Van H. Vu in their book in 2000's), an extremely old problem Cauchy‚ÄìDavenport theorem is one of the most fundamental results in this field. = Cauchy‚ÄìDavenport theorem = Suppose that A and B are finite subsets of \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} for a prime p, then the following inequality holds. : A+B \\\\ge \\\\min(A+B-1,p) = Vosper's theorem = Now we have the inequality for the cardinality of the sum set A + B, it is natural to ask the inverse problem, namely under what conditions on A and B does the equality hold? Vosper's theorem answers this question. Suppose that A,B \\\\ge 2 (that is, barring edge cases) and : A+B \\\\le A+B-1 \\\\le p-2, then A and B are arithmetic progressions with the same difference. This illustrates the structures that are often studied in additive combinatorics: the combinatorial structure of A+B as compared to the algebraic structure of arithmetic progressions. = Pl√ºnnecke‚ÄìRuzsa inequality = A useful theorem in additive combinatorics is Pl√ºnnecke‚ÄìRuzsa inequality. This theorem gives an upper bound on the cardinality of nA-mA in terms of the doubling constant of A. For instance using Pl√ºnnecke‚ÄìRuzsa inequality, we are able to prove a version of Freiman's Theorem in finite fields.  Basic notions  = Operations on sets = Let A and B be finite subsets of an abelian group, then the sum set is defined to be : A+B = \\\\\\\\{a+b : a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}. For example, we can write \\\\\\\\{1,2,3,4 \\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{2,3,4,5,6,7 \\\\\\\\}. Similarly we can define the difference set of A and B to be : A-B = \\\\\\\\{a-b : a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}. Here we provide other useful notations. : kA = \\\\underbrace{A+A+\\\\cdots+A}_{k\\\\text{ terms }} : k \\\\cdot A = \\\\\\\\{ka : a \\\\in A\\\\\\\\} = Doubling constant = Let A be a subset of an abelian group. The doubling constant measures how big the sum set A+A is compared to its original size A. We define the doubling constant of A to be : K = \\\\dfrac{A+A}{A}.  Ruzsa distance  Let A and B be two subsets of an abelian group. We define the Ruzsa distance between these two sets to be the quantity : d(A,B) = \\\\log \\\\dfrac{A-B}{\\\\sqrt{AB}}. Ruzsa triangle inequality tells us that the Ruzsa distance obeys the triangle inequality: :d(B,C) \\\\le d(A,B) + d(A,C). However, since d(A,A) cannot be zero, note that the Ruzsa distance is not actually a metric. References =Citations= * Tao, T., & Vu, V. (2012). Additive combinatorics.

It demonstrates how technologies can help achieve the objective of limiting the global temperature rise to 2¬∞C and enhancing energy security. G8 leaders invited the International Energy Agency to contribute to the Gleneagles G8 Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development in 2005. They asked the IEA to advise on alternative scenarios and strategies for a \\"clean, clever, competitive energy future\\". The results of this initiative included the Energy Technology Perspectives, first published in 2006. Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) gives a long-term outlook on the global energy system. The main results are presented up to the year 2050. For the 2012 edition the analysis was extended to include scenarios up to 2075. ETP models the global energy system under different scenarios for around 500 technology options. Aimed at policy makers, energy experts, business leaders and investors the book's purpose is to serve as a guide for decision makers on energy trends when setting policy and business objectives concerning energy technology. The book is accompanied by an online component which includes data visualisations, downloadable data and figures complements. Information on the modelling methodology, assumptions and results are also presented online. ETP 2014 Energy Technology Perspectives 2014 (ETP 2014) was published in May 2014. The publication focuses on electricity‚Äôs potential to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in the long-term. Limiting the long-term global temperature increase to 2 degrees remains a central objective of the work. The book, subtitled \\"Harnessing Electricity‚Äôs Potential\\" explains that electricity is key to sustainable energy systems for the future and focuses on what this means for generation, distribution and end-use consumption. ETP 2014 explores the possibility of \\"pushing the limits\\" in six areas: ‚Ä¢ Decarbonising energy supply: is solar the answer to a cleaner energy future? ‚Ä¢ What role will natural gas play: flexibility vs. base load? ‚Ä¢ Electrified transport: how quickly and far can we go? ‚Ä¢ Can energy storage become a game changer? ‚Ä¢ What is the best way to finance low-carbon sources for electricity generation? ‚Ä¢ How can India prepare for population growth driven energy demand increases?

The post requires a relevant postgraduate qualification and specialist training. This role is distinct within school psychology from that of the psychiatrist, clinical psychologist and psychometrist.  Role of Psychological Examiners in schools  School Psychological Examiners are assessors licensed by a State Department of Education to work with students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade in public schools, interviewing, observing, and administering and interpreting standardized testing instruments that measure cognitive and academic abilities, or describe behavior, personality characteristics, attitude or aptitude, in order to determine eligibility for special education services, placement, or conduct re- evaluation, or occupational guidance and planning. The work of the School Psychological Examiners is both qualitative and quantitative in nature. They prepare psychoeducational evaluation reports based on test results and interpretation. Integrated with case history, the evaluation reports should present an accurate and clear profile of a student‚Äôs level of functioning or disability, strengths and weaknesses, compare test results with the standards of the evaluation instruments, analyze potential test biases, and develop appropriate recommendations to help direct educational interventions and services in a most inclusive and least restrictive environment. Evaluation reports are framed by laws and regulations applicable to testing and assessment in special education, and must follow school district policies and the codes of ethics applicable to education, special education, and psychological assessment. School Psychological Examiners also provide psychoeducational interventions such as consultation services, collaboration in behavior management planning and monitoring, and devising social skills training programs in public schools. Unless additionally trained and licensed, School Psychological Examiners do not offer or provide psychotherapy or clinical diagnostic/treatment services, which are attributions of licensed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as provided by law and professional regulations.  Qualifications  School Psychological Examiners are highly trained and experienced educators who hold a master‚Äôs or higher degree in education or school counseling and at least one endorsement in special education. In addition to school district policies, School Psychological Examiners are bound by professional regulations, as well as by the ethical codes of testing and measurement. Other designations for School Psychological Examiners include ‚ÄòEducational Examiners‚Äô or ‚ÄòPsychoeducational Examiners.‚Äô Designation of this specialty varies among different school districts. 'Psychometrist,‚Äô from the term psychometrics, is an occupational designation not inclusive of the broader faculties of School Psychological Examiners. Psychometrists deal exclusively with quantitative test administration, do not require coursework beyond the bachelor's level, or licensure by a state department of education. Training of psychometrists is primarily done on-the- job, and their services are valuable in mental health community agencies, assessment and institutional research, or test-producing companies, etc., rather than in K-12 schools.  Graduate Training and Licensure of School Psychological Examiners  Typical training includes coursework beyond the Master of Education, Master of Science in Education, or Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Currently, School Psychological Examiners complete the courses required by their state department of education rather than by a prescribed self-contained program of studies. The coursework is equivalent to an entire Specialist or Doctoral Degree; unfortunately just a handful of institutions of higher education offer this kind of self-standing graduate program. Graduate courses of a psychological nature include: * Special Education Law * Advanced Child and Adolescent Growth and Development * Psychology of Students with Exceptionalities * Abnormal Child and Adult Psychology * Advanced Statistics and Research in Education and Psychology * Tests and measurements * Assessment and Evaluation of the Individual * Individual Intelligence quotient * Group Assessment * Diagnostics and Remedial Reading * Ethical issues in education and psychological measurement and evaluation reporting * Methods of Instructing Students with Mild/Moderate Disabilities * Methods of Instructing Students with Severe to Profound Disabilities * Survey of Guidance and Counseling Techniques * Practicum for School Psychological Examiners (150 supervised contact hours). Licensure as School Psychological Examiner demands experience in a special education or school counseling setting, satisfactory completion of the required graduate coursework and practicum, plus a passing score on the 'Praxis II Special Education: Knowledge-Based Core Principles'. Graduate school recommendation and verification of experience by the employing school district complete the requirements. In addition to the practicum, on-the-job mentoring supervision for at least two school years, sometimes four years, allows the transition from initial licensure to standard professional licensure. An annual professional development plan and ongoing performance-based evaluation ensure 'High Quality' professionalism as required by the No Child Left Behind law and related regulations.  Competencies  Additionally, high quality School Psychological Examiners exhibit proficiency-level knowledge on: * The provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Act and the Section 504 of the Civil Rights Act and related * State and federal laws, and all the applicable regulations, policies, and standards pertaining the provision of psychosocial and educational services to disabled individuals * Children and adolescents' advanced development and behavior * Multicultural factors in attitudes and behaviors * Analysis and diagnosis of learning problems including special consideration of low incidence populations * Integration of knowledge, facts, and theory on classroom environment, psychosocial principles, and test results, to plan for prescriptive instruction, management, and education of students with special needs * Focused and methodical psychoeducational evaluation reporting, providing sound and accurate information and research- based remediation recommendations to improve individual student's learning, achievement, and behavioral performance * Teamwork and collaboration for the process of staffing with other school professionals and collaborative development of instructional strategies for students with special needs * Provision of assistance with instructional modifications or accommodations, and programming or transition recommendations for the Individualized Education Program (IEP) * Accountability for the monitoring and outcome assessment of services and interventions.  Evaluation standards  Evaluation standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing, and reporting the psychoeducational evaluation reported by school psychological examiners. The evaluation is informed by professional codes of ethics. * Standards for Qualifications of Test UsersAssociation for Assessment in Counseling and Education * Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education * Standards for Multicultural Assessment * Standards for Educational and Psychological TestingThe Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, American Psychological Association  See also  * Educational assessment * Psychological evaluation * Standardized test * Intelligence quotient * Individual assessment * Psychoeducational interventions * Psychosocial interventions * School counselor * Individuals with Disabilities Education Act - IDEA * Special education * Individualized Education Program - IEP * Section 504 of The Civil Rights Act.

Small (d. January 15, 1918) was the convicted murderer of his wife, Florence Aileen Curry Small, in New Hampshire. Mr. and Mrs. Small took out a joint life insurance policy of $20,000 USD on March 16, 1916 from the John Hancock Company of Boston. The policy was written that the other spouse would collect if one spouse died. Mr. Small was 49 and Mrs. Small was 37 years old. One premium of $1,107.60 was paid before the incident. Her body was found in the ruins of her burnt Ossipee Lake two-story cottage on September 28, 1916. Mr. Small had been at the cottage that evening, but was traveling back to Boston when the body was found. Mrs. Small's skull was crushed and also had a cord wrapped around her neck. She had also been shot, and there was evidence she had been chloroformed. The body would have been destroyed by the fire except for the fact that the fire had compromised the floor of the cottage. The body was found floating in the flooded basement. At first the alibi of being in Boston was a good one, until investigators discovered an alarm clock, spark plug, fire screen, clock spring and some hairpins to make a timed arson device. Mr. Small was known to be a tinkerer who enjoyed mechanical projects. Mr. Small offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the murderer after he was taken into custody. Mr. Small was employed as a stock broker in Boston. He was married three times. His first wife, Nettie Davis of Minot, Maine, died during childbirth on March 14, 1891. She was 22 years old. In 1909 Small sued Arthur Soden, who was the president/part owner of the baseball team, Boston Beaneaters of the National League, for $500,000 USD. Small claimed that Soden had alienated the affections of Small's second wife. https://www.nytimes.com/1909/02/10/archives/wifes-affections-valued- at-500000-fl-small-boston-broker-sues-ah.html At the time the damage amount of the lawsuit was the largest in United States history, the equivalent of almost 12 million today's US dollars. Soden was ordered to pay Small a judgment of $10,000.  Aftermath of the crime  The State of New Hampshire executed Small by hanging on January 15, 1918. Small was the second of only three people executed by the state of New Hampshire in the 20th century. The other two were Oscar Comery in 1916 and Howard Long in 1939. Mrs. Small is currently buried in the Grant Hill Cemetery in Center Ossipee. Through the efforts of the Ossipee Historical Society and citizens of Ossipee, Florence Small was given proper ceremony on the 91st anniversary of her death, and her site is now identified with a marker.

The Snake-witch (), Snake-charmer () or Smiss stone () is a picture stone found at Smiss, N√§r socken, Gotland, Sweden.  History  Discovered in a cemetery, it measures in height and depicts a figure holding a snake in each hand.Nyl√©n & Lamm 1988, p. 40-41. Above the figure there are three interlaced creatures (forming a triskelion pattern) that have been identified as a boar, an eagle, and a wolf.Hermodsson 2000, p. 109.

Although a number of scholars call it the Snake- witch, what the stone depicts‚Äîan accurate interpretation of the figures‚Äîand whether it derives from Celtic art or Norse art remain debated.  Parallels, interpretations, and speculation  The figure on the stone was first described by Sune Lindquist in 1955. He tried unsuccessfully to find connections with accounts in Old Icelandic sources, and he also compared the stone with the Snake Goddess from Crete. Lindquist found connections with the late Celtic Gundestrup cauldron, although he appears to have overlooked that the cauldron also shows a figure holding a snake.Hermodsson 2000, p. 110. Arrhenius and Holmquist (1960) also found a connection with late Celtic art suggesting that the stone depicted Daniel in the lions' den and compared it with a depiction on a purse lid from Sutton Hoo, although the stone in question does not show creatures with legs. Arwidsson (1963) also attributed the stone to late Celtic art and compared it with the figure holding a snake on the Gundestrup cauldron.Hermodsson 2000, p. 111. In a later publication Arrhenius (1994) considered the figure not to be a witch but a magician and she dated it to the Vendel Period, although men are called witches also, and the legs spread clearly identifies this as a female, making her a witch who was a magician. Hauk (1983), who is a specialist on bracteates, suggested that the stone depicts Odin in the fetch of a woman, while G√∂rman (1983) has proposed that the stone depicts the Celtic god Cernunnos.Hermodsson 2000, p. 112. It also has been connected to a nearby stone relief on a doorjamb at V√§te Church on Gotland which shows a woman who suckles two dragons, but this was made five centuries later than the picture stone.

British Museum File:Lady suckling dragons at V√§te church.JPGThe relief at V√§te of a woman suckling dragons  Snake symbolism  Snakes were popular as a motif on later picture stones which show snake pits, used as a painful means of execution; this form of punishment also is known through Norse sagas. Snakes are considered to have had an important symbolism during the passage from paganism to Germanic Christianity. They were frequently combined with images of deer, crustaceans, or supernatural beasts. The purpose may have been to protect the stones and to deter people who might destroy them.

In 1998 he won the NHK Mile Cup and the Japan Cup. In the following year he was campaigned in Europe where he won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Prix Foy before finishing second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was retired to stud but died after three seasons following unsuccessful colic surgery. El Condor Pasa has been described as the best Japanese racehorse of the 20th century. Background El Condor Pasa was a dark bay horse with a large white star bred in Kentucky by his Japanese owner Takashi Watanabe. His sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Light Shift, Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator, Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan, France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Watanabe sent the horse into training with Yoshi Ninomiya, who operated a small stable with only ten horses. Racing career El Condor Pasa won his only race as a two-year-old in 1997. In the following year he won his first four races culminating in a win in the Group One NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 17 May. After a summer break he returned in October and was tried beyond a mile for the first time when finishing second to Silence Suzuka in the Mainichi Okan. Despite losing his unbeaten record he started 5/1 third favourite for the Japan Cup over one and a half miles on 29 November. Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina, he took the lead in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from the mare Air Groove and the favourite Special Week. His win was enthusiastically received by the crowd of 146,879 and his trainer described the winner as \\"a hero... he has a huge heart\\". In 1999 El Condor Pasa was sent to France where he was trained with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as his objective. On his first European outing he finished second to Croco Rouge in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp Racecourse in May. Two months later he faced opponents from France, Germany and Britain in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Ebina sent the colt into the lead in the straight and he drew clear to win by two and a half lengths from Tiger Hill and Dream Well, with Sagamix and Borgia among those unplaced. On his final trial for the Arc he defeated Borgia and Croco Rouge in the Prix Foy at Longchamp in September. On 3 October, El Condor Pasa started the 18/5 second favourite for the Arc behind Montjeu, the three-year-old winner of both the Prix du Jockey Club and Irish Derby. El Condor Pasa led from the start and broke clear of the field in the straight to establish a three length advantage. Montjeu emerged as his only challenger, and although El Condor Pasa rallied when the French colt drew alongside him he was overtaken in the last hundred metres and beaten by half a length. The first two were six lengths clear of the third placed Croco Rouge. Assessment and honours El Condor Pasa was named Japanese Champion Three-year-old Colt for 1998. Despite never running in Japan during the following year, El Condor Pasa's performances in France led to his being voted the 1999 Japanese Champion Older Horse and Japanese Horse of the Year. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated El Condor Pasa the best racehorse trained in Japan in the 20th century. Stud record El Condor Pasa was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Shadai Stallion Station in Hokkaido. In July 2002 the horse became gravely ill with horse colic. El Condor Pasa underwent surgery but died at 9.10 p.m. on 16 July. His three crops of foals contained several major winners including Vermilion (Japan Cup Dirt, February Stakes), Song of Wind (Kikuka Sh≈ç) and Alondite (Japan Cup Dirt).  Pedigree  * El Condor Pasa was inbred 3 √ó 4 to the stallion Northern Dancer, meaning that Northern Dancer appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

First published 1990 in French. English edition 345 p., translation by Peter Kussi. This novel springs from a casual gesture of a woman, seemingly to her swimming instructor. Immortality is the last of a trilogy that includes The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Plot Divided into seven parts, Immortality centers on Agnes, her husband Paul and her sister Laura. Part One: the Face establishes these characters. Part Two: Immortality depicts Goethe's fraught relationship with Bettina, a young woman who aspires to create a place for herself in the pantheon of history by controlling Goethe's legacy after his death. Part Three: Agnes and Laura fight, while focusing on the deteriorating state of Laura's relationship with Bernard Bertrand. Part Four: Homo Sentimentalis chronicles Goethe's afterlife and postmortem friendship with Ernest Hemingway. Part Five: Chance sees Agnes' death, and intersects these fictional events with Kundera's seemingly autobiographical account of a conversation with Professor Avenarius.

History In the early afternoon of 26 April 1803 a meteorite shower of more than 3000 fragments fell upon the town of L'Aigle in Normandy, France. Upon hearing of this event the French Academy of Sciences sent the young scientist Jean-Baptiste Biot to investigate that spectacular fall of stones. After painstaking work in the field he reported two kinds of evidence pointing to an extraterrestrial origin for the stones:M. Gounelle. The meteorite fall at L'Aigle on April 26th 1803 and the Biot report.(Biot, 1803), p. 9. # Physical evidence: the sudden appearance of many identical stones similar to other stones fallen from the sky in other places # Moral evidence: many witnesses who observed a \\"rain of stones thrown by the meteor\\" Biot's passionate paper describing how these stones must undoubtedly be of extraterrestrial origin effectively gave birth to the science of meteoritics. The L'Aigle event was a milestone in the understanding of meteorites and their origins because at that time the mere existence of meteorites was harshly debated. If they were recognised, their origin was controversial, with most commentators agreeing with Aristotle that they were terrestrial, and witnessed meteorite falls were treated with great skepticism. The meteorite has since been stored along with Angers, another meteorite that struck France 19 years later, in a room at the Mus√©um d'histoire naturelle d‚ÄôAngers, a French natural history museum.

History Orcustus formed in Bergen, Norway, in early 2002 by Taipan, Dirge Rep, Infernus and Tormentor. Their moniker, meaning \\"the inner circle of Hell where Lucifer resides on his throne\\", was suggested by Dirge Rep and the band got approval to use it from the name's rightful owner, B√•rd \\"Faust\\" Eithun, who published the underground fanzine Orcustus in the early 1990s. Summer 2002 saw the band beginning to rehearse three tracks which eventually became the Demo 2002. These tracks were already written by Taipan for his former band Abattoir during the years 1998-2000. The demo was recorded in the autumn of 2002 and released early in 2003. The demo was quickly sold out, and garnered praise from well-known figures in the black metal scene, such as Fenriz of Darkthrone. This release led to a deal with the American label Southern Lord Recordings and later that year two tracks from the demo were released as the World Dirtnap 7‚Äù EP. Work for their debut album then began. Teloch entered the band in 2004 and contributed with the track \\"Grin of Deceit\\" to the 2005 Wrathrash 7‚Äù EP. The title track hailed from the Abattoir days. A track called \\"I Satans virke\\" was also recorded in that session for a split 7‚Äù EP with the Norwegian band Daudur due for release on Worship Him Records in 2009. Teloch‚Äôs involvement with Orcustus came to an end in 2006. After five years in the making, recording the Orcustus album commenced in spring 2007. Recording and mixing were completed in June 2008. By this time inner and outer adversity had taken its toll and the decision was made to end the band. However, in the last week of 2008, Dirge Rep and Taipan decided to pick up the pieces in order to resurrect Orcustus.

The French claimed that their troops had been ambushed by the Chinese. The incident led to the Sino-French War (August 1884 ‚Äì April 1885).  Background  In late 1883 France and China began to fight an undeclared war in Tonkin. In December 1883, in the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign, the French defeated the Black Flag Army and captured the town of S∆°n T√¢y. In March 1884, in the B·∫Øc Ninh campaign, they defeated China's Guangxi Army and captured the strategically important town of B·∫Øc Ninh on the Mandarin Road. The defeat at B·∫Øc Ninh, coming close on the heels of the fall of S∆°n T√¢y, strengthened the hand of the moderate element in the Chinese government and temporarily discredited the extremist 'Purist' party led by Zhang Zhidong, which was agitating for a full-scale war against France. Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the capture of H∆∞ng H√≥a and Th√°i Nguy√™n, convinced the Empress Dowager Cixi that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tianjin (Tientsin). Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain Fran√ßois-Ernest Fournier, commander of the French cruiser Volta, represented France. The Tientsin Accord, concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam. Fournier was not a professional diplomat, and the Tientsin Accord contained several loose ends. Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. The war party called for Li Hongzhang's impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.Lung Chang, 222‚Äì6 Li Hongzhang hinted to the French that there might be difficulties in enforcing the accord, but nothing specific was said. The French assumed that the Chinese troops would leave Tonkin as agreed, and made preparations for occupying L·∫°ng S∆°n and other cities up to the Chinese border.  Approach march  Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne (1841‚Äì87) The route followed by Dugenne's column along the Mandarin Road from Phu Lang Thuong to B·∫Øc L·ªá In early June 1884 a French column under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne advanced to occupy the border towns of L·∫°ng S∆°n, Cao B·∫±ng and That Khe. Dugenne's column consisted of a battalion of marine infantry (chef de bataillon Reygasse), an artillery battery (Captain Jourdy), a newly recruited company of Tonkinese riflemen, and a small force of chasseurs d'Afrique (Captain Laperrine).The infantry in Dugenne's column included the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Companies, 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Buquet, Jeannin and Penther), the 2nd Company, 2nd African Battalion (Captain Maillard), and the 12th Company, 1st Tonkinese Rifle Regiment (Captain Bouchet and Lieutenants Delmotte and Bataille). Reygasse's marsouins were veteran soldiers, who had served under the command of Commandant Henri Rivi√®re at the Capture of Nam ƒê·ªãnh (March 1883), but the Tonkinese riflemen had only been recruited several days earlier, and were of negligible military value. The column needed to take food and rations for 45 days, and the combatants (450 Frenchmen and 350 Tonkinese) were accompanied by 1,000 Vietnamese porters, 240 French mule drivers and 200 mules. As the French were advancing through unknown country, Captain Jean-Fran√ßois-Alphonse Lecomte of the topographical service rode with the column to map the route. Lecomte, who served with distinction on General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle's staff throughout the Sino- French War, would later write a detailed account of the ambush, Le guet-apens de Bac-L√© (Paris, 1890). The column formed at Phu Lang Thuong, the most advanced French post on the Mandarin Road, on 11 June. It set off for L·∫°ng S∆°n on 12 June, reaching Phu Xuyen on 13 June, K√©p on 14 June and Cau Son on 15 June. The march, under a sweltering summer sun, was gruelling, and on 15 June Dugenne sent Jourdy's battery back to Phu Lang Thuong. At the same time he was reinforced by a company of z√©phyrs from chef de bataillon Servi√®re's 2nd African Light Infantry Battalion. French officer of the topographical service, probably Captain Jean-Fran√ßois-Alphonse Lecomte (1850‚Äì1919) Recent heavy rain had swollen the Song Thuong river, and the French were unable to use the ford at Cau Son. The column therefore remained at Cau Son for three days while its engineers bridged the Song Thuong, and only resumed its march on 19 June. For the next three days the column pressed on to the northeast, marching parallel to the course of the Thuong river and camping in the open country between Cau Son and the small town of B·∫Øc L·ªá. The French now became aware that their march was being observed. Single shots were heard in the distance at regular intervals, and on one occasion French cavalry scouts came under fire. It was not clear whether the attackers were Vietnamese bandits or Chinese soldiers. On the morning of 22 June the French column reached B·∫Øc L·ªá. Continuing their march in the afternoon, the French descended once more into the Song Thuong valley and rejoined the river. Dugenne's intention was to cross the Song Thuong and continue up the Mandarin Road to Thanh Moy and L·∫°ng S∆°n. The river was still swollen, and on the evening of 22 June Dugenne scouted its southern bank for a suitable ford. Chinese soldiers were visible on the other side of the river, and Laperrine's troopers covered them with their carbines while a French NCO tested the depth of the river. Neither side opened fire. Believing that he was dealing with stragglers from the Guangxi Army who would not oppose his passage, Dugenne gave orders for a crossing of the Song Thuong the following morning.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 1‚Äì102 In fact Dugenne was facing a force of 3,100 regular Chinese soldiers of the Guangxi Army under the command of Wan Zhongxuan (Ëê¨ÈáçÊöÑ). This force consisted of eight battalions under the command of Huang Yuxian (ÈªÉÁéâË≥¢) and one battalion under the command of Wang Hongshun (ÁéãÊ¥™È†Ü). A further 1,500 Chinese troops under the command of Pan Dingxin (ÊΩòÈºéÊñ∞) were camped close by. Most of the Chinese troops were armed with modern rapid-firing Remington rifles. Both commanders were aware of the provisions of the Tientsin Accord, but as a result of the political intrigues aimed at Li Hongzhang they had received no instructions to withdraw from Tonkin. They had instead been ordered by the commander of the Guangxi Army (a yung-ying regional army), Wang Debang (ÁéãÂæ∑Ê¶ú), to hold their positions.Lung Chang, 243‚Äì5 Wang Debang had experience serving with General Zuo Zongtang.  Ambush  The B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush, 23 June 1884At dawn on 23 June Captain Lecomte crossed the Song Thuong with the column's advance guard (two companies of French infantry, a section of Tonkinese riflemen and a small party of cavalry). The crossing was observed by a force of Chinese infantry deployed in a defensive position on a wooded hill 250 metres behind the river. The Chinese allowed the French troops to cross unmolested, but opened fire while the Tonkinese riflemen were crossing. Their shots were high, and it is possible that they were intended to warn rather than to kill. Lecomte reacted immediately to this hostile demonstration, deploying his infantry to flank the Chinese out of their position. The French drove the Chinese from the hill, and Lecomte established a defensive position to shelter the crossing of the rest of the column. By 11 a.m. the entire French column had crossed the Song Thuong.Lecomte, Vie militaire, 47‚Äì52 By then an interesting situation had developed at the French advance posts. At 9 a.m. three Chinese envoys came forward with a written message for Dugenne from the Chinese commanders. Lecomte let them through, and an interview took place. Although Dugenne's Vietnamese interpreters were unable to grasp some of the subtleties in the Chinese message, they were able to establish that the French were facing regular troops of the Guangxi Army and that the Chinese commanders were aware of their obligations under the Tientsin Accord. The Chinese generals explained that they had received no orders to withdraw, and were consequently obliged to remain in their positions until further notice. They requested Dugenne to send a heliograph message back to Hanoi to seek instructions.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 111‚Äì19 In view of the diplomatic significance of the confrontation, Dugenne should have reported the presence of the Chinese force to Hanoi and asked for further instructions. Instead, he informed the Chinese at 3 p.m. that he would continue his march up the Mandarin Road in one hour's time. According to Captain Lecomte (normally a reliable source), Dugenne believed that the Chinese would let him pass, and his intention was merely to get his column away from the swollen Song Thuong River and to find a secure camping ground for the night.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 119‚Äì20 Captain Marie Dominique LaperrineLEONORE base of the Chasseurs d'Afrique, whose cavalrymen covered the French retreat and helped evacuate the wounded on 24 June At 4 p.m. Dugenne resumed his advance. Aware of the potential for a misunderstanding, he gave strict instructions that nobody was to open fire except on his order. For several minutes the French column marched unmolested along a jungle path towards a group of Chinese forts on the cliffs of Nui ƒê·ªìng Nai. Seeing the path opening into a clearing, Dugenne ordered Laperrine's cavalry to replace an inexperienced section of Tonkinese riflemen at the front of the column. As the French cavalry spurred their horses forward to move to the front of the column, Chinese infantry in the Nui ƒê·ªìng Nai forts suddenly opened fire on them. Seconds later, Chinese infantry shadowing the march of the French column opened fire on both its flanks. It is not clear whether the Chinese were alarmed by the sudden movement of the French cavalry or (as the French believed) they mistook the horsemen for a party of senior officers and deliberately fired on this tempting target.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 123‚Äì6 The marine infantry of the French vanguard deployed as best they could and replied to the Chinese fire. Dugenne, who was leading the column's main body, ordered a bugler to sound for a ceasefire, but the bugle call had no effect. The Chinese were sounding their own trumpets to bring more of their own men into action, and as it became clear that the battle could not be stopped Dugenne planned his defence. He formed his men into a square, enclosing his vulnerable baggage train, and ordered them to dig trenches. During the late afternoon of 23 March the French successfully repelled repeated Chinese attacks, and were even able to counterattack with some effect. However, the Chinese brought up fresh troops during the night, and occupied positions on the heights of Nui ƒê·ªìng Nai from which they could fire down on the French square.Lecomte, Guet- apens, 131‚Äì9 On the morning of June 24, the Chinese worked their way around the sides of the French square in an attempt to cut the column's line of retreat to the Song Thuong. Dugenne made several local counterattacks to take some air around his positions, but it soon became obvious that, with no artillery support, the French would be encircled and annihilated if they remained where they were. At 11 a.m. Dugenne issued orders for a withdrawal to the Song Thuong.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 144‚Äì9 Although the column suffered heavy casualties from rifle fire during the withdrawal and was forced to abandon its baggage train, Dugenne successfully fought his way out of the threatened encirclement and extricated his small force. Captain Laperrine, the commander of Dugenne's small cavalry contingent, dismounted his troopers so that wounded men could be loaded onto the cavalry horses. The successful evacuation of the wounded was due in no small measure to the coolness with which Laperrine and his chasseurs d'Afrique covered the retreat.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 149‚Äì58 Falling back by echelons, the French recrossed the Song Thuong under fire and regrouped on its southern bank. In the afternoon of 24 June the column retreated to B·∫Øc L·ªá, followed at a respectful distance by the victorious Chinese, and occupied a defensive position on a high plateau.Lecomte, Guet- apens, 158‚Äì65  The relief expedition  General Fran√ßois de N√©grier joins Dugenne's column on the B·∫Øc L·ªá plateau, 27 June 1884 Dugenne had heliographed news of the battle back to Hanoi during the night of 23 June, and General Millot, the French commander-in-chief, immediately despatched General Fran√ßois de N√©grier and Lieutenant-Colonel Letellier to Dugenne's assistance with a substantial relief column assembled from the garrisons of Hanoi and B·∫Øc Ninh. He also ordered the 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps to concentrate at Phu Lang Thuong. De N√©grier left Hanoi on 24 June with two Turco battalions, two companies of the 143rd Line Battalion and two 80-millimetre artillery batteries.The column included two companies of the 143rd Line Battalion (Captains Astier and Barbier) and the 11th and 12th Army Artillery Batteries (Captains Palle and de Saxc√©). Travelling upriver aboard a flotilla of steamboats to Phu Lang Thuong and thereafter marching light, de N√©grier's relief column reached Cau Son on the evening of 25 June.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 175‚Äì6; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 196; Histoire militaire, 90 De N√©grier joined Dugenne's column near B·∫Øc L·ªá on the morning of 27 June and made preparations for an immediate counterattack to throw the Chinese back across the Song Thuong. The French scouted the Chinese positions during the afternoon, and de N√©grier issued orders for an attack the following morning. However, on the evening of 27 June he received a heliograph message from Millot, ordering him to return to Hanoi at once. The French premier Jules Ferry had decided to lodge a diplomatic protest and demand an explanation from the Chinese government. De N√©grier complied with this unwelcome order. During the night of 28 June, under cover of a heavy thunderstorm, he and Dugenne withdrew their respective commands from the B·∫Øc L·ªá plateau unnoticed by the Chinese. On the afternoon of 29 June the French reached Cau Son, where the wounded from the B·∫Øc L·ªá battle were evacuated back to Phu Lang Thuong by junk. At Phu Lang Thuong the wounded were transferred to the gunboat √âclair, which ferried them rapidly back to Hanoi. In early July the exhausted men of Dugenne's column returned to Hanoi. De N√©grier remained at Phu Lang Thuong with the 2nd Brigade, pressing Millot in vain for orders to attack the Chinese.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 179‚Äì91  Casualties  French casualties in the B·∫Øc L·ªá Ambush were 22 dead and 70 wounded. Chinese casualties were markedly higher, approximately 300 dead and wounded in total.  Millot's order of the day  On July 1, 1884, General Millot issued the following order of the day to the men of Dugenne's column. Significantly, he blamed the engagement near B·∫Øc L·ªá on the bad faith of the Chinese and described it as an ambush. Henceforth, the battle became, in French eyes, the 'B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush'. > Partis en petit nombre pour occuper, conform√©ment aux ordres du Gouvernement > et suivant les conventions de Tien-Tsin, les places fronti√®res du Tonkin et > de la Chine, vous avez √©t√©s attaqu√©s dans les gorges de Lang-Son par un > ennemi d√©loyal qui s‚Äô√©tait pr√©par√© pour vous attaquer dans un guet-apens. > Mais gr√¢ce √† votre √©nergie, vous avez d√©jou√© toutes ses ruses, vous avez > combattu avec succ√®s √† une contre dix et vous avez fait respecter le drapeau > et l'honneur de nos armes.

Significance  When news of the 'B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush' reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Ferry's government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tientsin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay an indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet was ordered to take his Far East Squadron to Fuzhou (Foochow). The negotiations broke down in mid-August and on 23 August 1884, at the Battle of Fuzhou, Courbet annihilated China's Fujian Fleet, inaugurating the nine- month Sino-French War. The defeat of the French forces also resulted in the unsuccessful French attempt to attack and take Taiwan, where the Chinese Huai Army under Liu Mingchuan defeated the French at the Keelung Campaign and Battle of Tamsui.

It was the largest fort on Hadrian's Wall, and is now buried beneath the suburb of Stanwix, in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. Roman name The fort was called Petrianis in the Notitia Dignitatum, but on the Ravenna Cosmography it is called Uxellodamo. On the Rudge Cup it is called VXELODVM. On the Amiens Skillet it is called VXELODVNVM. It is also called VXELODVNVM on the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan. The name Petrianis comes from the cohort that was stationed there. Uxelodunum, which appears to be a latinisation of a Celtic toponym, is thought to mean High Fort.For the etymology of the \\"dun\\" element in the name, see Dun. There was a similarly named hill fort in Gaul called Uxellodunum (see Uxellodunum, Encyclopedia Universalis for its etymology). It is thus likely that the name Petriana was a scribal error which confused the fort's name and the occupying unit, and that the fort's true name was Uxelodunum. Description The fort is about forty miles west of the fort of Castlesteads (Camboglanna) and five and a half miles east of Burgh by Sands (Aballava). It stands on a natural platform above the River Eden. The fort measures about north to south by east to west, covering approximately , much larger than the other wall forts. The fort is adjacent to the Wall, which passes along its north side. Apparently the fort was intended to guard the Eden bridgehead and watch the important western route to and from Scotland. The fort is now covered with buildings in the modern Carlisle suburb of Stanwix. Garrison Because of the large size of the fort, it is thought to have housed a cavalry regiment, one thousand strong. This was almost certainly the Ala Petriana, the sole regiment of this size on the Wall. This was a distinguished auxiliary regiment, whose soldiers had been made Roman citizens for valour on the field of battle. It seems that the fort was given the name of its garrison, thus supplanting the earlier name of Uxelodunum. Excavations Excavations were made in 1932‚Äì4, and the ditch for the south rampart was traced, as well as Hadrian's Wall, which formed the north face of the fort. Barrack-like buildings were also found within the outline of the fort. In 1939 a large granary, lying east to west, was found in extending the local school-yard. In 1940 the south-west angle tower was found as well as the south and east walls. In 1934 various objects were found which appeared to have been washed down into the river from the fort. These included brooches, mountings for cavalrymen's uniforms and harness. The Vallum has been traced to a point just short of the south-east angle of the fort. In 2017 a major discovery was made of the fort's bath-house, by the riverside beneath the grounds of Carlisle Cricket Club. The well-preserved remains included a hypocaust for heating. Also found was an inscription to Julia Domna, the mother of the Emperor Caracalla.http://www.newsandstar.co.uk She was also the wife of the Emperor Septimius Severus, whom she accompanied in Britain from 208 until his death in 211 at York. The inscription prompts the question, did Julia Domna and her husband visit Petriana? References * J.

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said that an inquiry indicated the attacker had been acting alone. A motive for the attack could not immediately be determined, but police at the scene referred to the incident as a terrorist attack. Three copycat attacks have occurred since then. This attack was the second incident in 2008 in which an Israeli Arab committed a violent act in west Jerusalem while carrying an Israeli ID Card (allowing for freedom of movement and travel throughout Israel), the first being the Mercaz HaRav massacre in early March 2008. On April 7, 2009, Duwait's house was demolished as a declared deterrent against future attacks, the first such demolition since 2005. The attack Damage caused by the attack Preliminary investigations suggest the Caterpillar 966 front-end loader was taken from a nearby construction site on Jaffa Road. The perpetrator then drove the vehicle against traffic, before hitting an Egged public bus near the city's old Central Bus Station. The impact flipped the bus onto its side, hitting nearby vehicles and pedestrians. The perpetrator, Hussam Taysir Duwait, was also heard yelling \\"Allahu Akbar\\" during the attack. After a traffic policewoman had shot the driver, the vehicle came to a halt but then started again and crushed another car, killing another person. At the point when the vehicle had stopped for the first time, three men had climbed up to the cabin: A 20-year-old off-duty soldier from Jerusalem, Moshe Plesser, who had recently enlisted at the Israel Defense Forces, an unnamed policeman, and Oron Ben Shimon, an armed civilian and manager of a regional security firm. According to Oron, while he was struggling with the driver inside the cabin, trying to get his feet off the accelerator and take over the wheel, he shouted at the soldier to shoot the driver. The soldier then grabbed Oron's handgun and killed Duwait with three shots to the head at point blank range. After the vehicle had immediately come to a halt again, motorcycle policeman Eli Mizrahi climbed the cabin and fired two more shots. Haaretz quotes the soldier as saying that \\"I got closer to the bulldozer, the whole time looking for my weapon to shoot him.\\" Coincidentally, the soldier is the brother-in-law of Captain David Shapira, the paratrooper officer who shot and killed the perpetrator in the Mercaz HaRav massacre. The moments during which the perpetrator was shot and killed have been filmed from at least two different angles, which accounts for the greater level of directly available descriptive detail in comparison to the original attack which is documented only through eyewitnesses on the scene as well as images that were taken mostly after the incident itself. 250px One witness is quoted as saying that Duwait was armed and 'shooting at a police officer'. =Fatalities= * Batsheva Unterman, 33, of Jerusalem \\\\- a kindergarten teacher, and the wife of Ido Unterman, grandson of former Chief rabbi Isser Yehuda Unterman. She was in her car at the scene of the attack. Her 6-month-old daughter was pulled from the car just before it was hit. * Elizabeth Goren-Friedman, 54, of Jerusalem \\\\- originally of Austria, Elizabeth Goren-Friedman worked as a teacher in a school for the blind. * Jean Relevy, 68, of Jerusalem \\\\- an air-conditioner technician who lived in the Gilo neighborhood. The perpetrator Duwait, a 32-year-old father of two from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sur Baher, was carrying an Israeli identity card, and was hired by a local construction firm for the Jerusalem Light Rail. Three Palestinian organizations took responsibility for the attack: the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the Galilee Freedom Battalion (), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Despite the Palestinian claims of responsibility, Israeli police chief Dudi Cohen said the attacker appeared to be acting alone and that \\"it looks as if it was a spontaneous act.\\" Some two hours after the attack, a Hamas spokesman said that the attack is \\"a natural response to Israeli aggression.\\" Nevertheless, he stressed that Hamas did not know who was behind the attack. Shimon Kokos, the lawyer of the perpetrator's family, said that Hussam \\"had not belonged to any militant organization and may have acted out of temporary insanity\\" and that, \\"had [he] not been killed during his rampage, it is doubtful whether he would have been judged fit to stand trial.\\" \\"My son never spoke of plans to carry out such an attack, if he had I would have tried to prevent it,\\" Duwait's father, Tayseer told The Media Line as police officers were about to question him. A Jewish ex-girlfriend of Duwait, commented that \\"he really didn't hate Jews. The fact is that he was with me. It's insanity, but the motivation was not nationalist\\" and also that his bad temper may have been related to his \\"[smoking] a lot of drugs.\\" Other people have gone on the record as well alleging regular drug abuse by Duwait, one neighbour saying that he was \\"a drug addict [...]. He'd shoot up all the time. [...] He was really just a junkie.\\" Aftermath Israeli Border Guard officers ordered the Duwait family to remove the mourning tent they erected in the neighborhood for their son. A Border Guard patrol passing through the area identified the construction of the tent and ordered the family to remove it. The family then disassembled the tent without any noted resistance. Two days after the attack, defense minister Ehud Barak ordered the demolition of Duwait's and Alaa Abu Dhein's (perpetrator of the Mercaz HaRav massacre) houses, as a stated deterrent against future attacks. Following the supreme court rejection of appeals by Duwait's family, his home was razed on April 7, 2009, the first such demolition since a military commission recommended against such action in 2005. During the demolition, police shot dead a Palestinian motorist who ran over and injured three police officers. =Bulldozer attack of July 22= On July 22, another east Jerusalem Arab resident, Ghassan Abu Tir, rammed his bulldozer (this time it was a smaller backhoe loader) into cars and a bus on King David street in Jerusalem. He wounded 24 people, including one whose leg was partially severed. He was subsequently killed by a fusillade of gunfire from a Border Policeman and an armed pedestrian. The attack was seen as a copycat act of to the July 2 attack, causing fears of repeated copycat acts in an emerging new terrorist tactic of vehicle ramming attacks. The attack happened just down the road from the hotel where Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama was due to stay as part of a multi-country visit. =BMW attack= On September 22, 2008, Qassem Mughrabi, a resident of East Jerusalem, drove a black BMW into a group of off-duty soldiers standing on a Jerusalem street injuring 19. Mughrabi was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Police spokesmen asserted the event was a terrorist attack, not an accident. =5 March 2009 attack= Two police officers were lightly wounded in Jerusalem when an Arab bulldozer driver overturned their police car and rammed it into a bus, before being fatally shot by police and an armed taxi driver. The attack occurred around 1 P.M. near the Malha shopping mall, on Menachem Begin Boulevard in southern Jerusalem. Police said that a copy of the Koran had been found in the bulldozer after the attack, and that the driver had not been carrying any identification. Israel Police and local residents later identified the man as Marei Radaydeh, a West Bank construction worker in his mid-20s who lived with his family in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina. Radaydeh was married and had a daughter. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a \\"natural response\\" to Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes in Arab East Jerusalem and to Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip. Official reactions ;Involved parties : * Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert mentioned that \\"There is no way to fence-off the Arabs of east Jerusalem and every home of a potential terrorist,\\" and that \\"We need to stop the terror attacks carried out by east Jerusalem Arabs, and if that must be done through means of deterrence or the demolition of a home ‚Äì then so be it.\\" B'Tselem has condemned the plans as \\"illegal collective punishment.\\" * President of Israel, Shimon Peres expressed pride in the speedy actions of the soldier who fired at and killed the attacker. : * Palestinian National Authority: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack stating \\"We want peaceful solutions through negotiations.\\" * Hamas government in the Gaza Strip praised the attack. ;Supranational * : Ban Ki Moon, United Nations Secretary General expressed condolences to the relatives of the dead victims, and wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured. ;International * : British Foreign Secretary David Miliband condemned the attack, calling it a \\"horrific act.\\" * : President of the United States, George W.

Although postnationalism is not strictly considered the antonym of nationalism, the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic as postnationalism is an internationalistic process. There are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements. Increasing globalization of economic factors (such as the expansion of international trade with raw materials, manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets) have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, socio-political power is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations, the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and NATO. In addition, media and entertainment industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. Migration of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.R. Koopmans and P. Statham; \\"Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany\\"; American Journal of Sociology 105:652‚Äì96 (1999)R.A.

The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship\\"; International Migration Review 38:389‚Äì426 (2004)  Postnationalism and human rights  In the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international human rights law and norms. International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their \\"personhood,\\" not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by non-citizens, but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on universal criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in western countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), citizenship based on ethnic descent, which had caused German-born Turks, for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include Yasemin Soysal, David Jacobson, and Saskia Sassen.Yasemin Soysal, \\"Limits of Citizenship:Migrants and Postnational Membership in Europe,\\" University of Chicago Press, 1994; and David Jacobson, \\"Rights Across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996  In the European Union  The European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.M. Rambour; (2005)J. Shaw; \\"Postnational constitutionalism in the European Union\\"; Journal of European Policy 6:579‚Äì97 (1999)M. Wilkinson; (2002)  In Canada  During the 2011 election, John Ibbitson when describing what he describes the fading issues of the \\"Laurentian consensus\\" argued that they were responsible for turning Canada into the first post national state. In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while defining Canadian values declared his country to be the world‚Äôs first postnational state. In 2019, Robert Dutrisac writing in Le Devoir, associated with multiculturalism , which he described as an ideology associated with English Canada. While, John Weissenberger associated the Trudeau description as an argument that Laurentian Elite have\\" diluted the ‚ÄúLaurentian‚Äù nature of the class and boosted their disdain for national character.\\"  In the media  Catherine Frost, professor of political science at McMaster University, argues that while the Internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have \\"the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations\\".C. Frost; \\"Internet galaxy meets postnational constellation: Prospects for political solidarity after the Internet\\"; Information Society 22:45‚Äì49 (2006) Nonetheless, it has been argued the increasing options of obtaining virtual citizenship from established nations (e.g., E-Residency of Estonia) and micronations can be seen as examples of what citizenship might look like in a post-national world.  In sports  Postnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship (UEFA Euro 2008) \\"the first postnational\\" European Championship.Simon Kuper; \\"Steeds Liever\\"; Vrij Nederland p. 24, June 28, 2008 He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans sportsmanship and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.

The village is about above sea level on a hill of Early Jurassic Middle Lias clay. The village is the northernmost settlement in Oxfordshire. The parish is bounded by Warwickshire to the west and Northamptonshire to the east. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 306. Church and chapel =Church of England= The Church of England parish church of Saint James the Great was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Cropredy until 1851. St. James' was originally Norman, built in about AD 1100. The arcade between the nave and north aisle survives from this date, as does the south doorway. Slightly later a chapel was added at the east end of the north aisle, linked by Early English Gothic arches to both the aisle and the chancel. There is also a squint from the chapel to the chancel. The bell tower was added in the 14th century, and the chancel was extended eastwards in either the 14th or the 15th century. The south porch is a late Mediaeval Perpendicular Gothic addition, and the ironwork on the south door was added in 1640. In 1856 the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of the church building. In 1860 the Gothic Revival architect William White heavily restored the building, including renewal of the foundations. White almost completely rebuilt the north aisle, and so altered the chancel that its original date may not be determined with certainty. The bell tower has three bells. Two were cast by a member or members of the Newcombe family of bell-founders: the second bell in 1609 and the treble in 1611. At that time the Newcombes had foundries at Bedford and Leicester. The tenor bell was cast in 1756 and Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast it in 1910. For technical reasons the bells are currently unringable. The church has also an early clock of an unusual design. The date of its manufacture is unknown, but its style suggests that it dates from the 17th century. St. James' parish is now part of the Benefice of Shires' Edge along with those of Cropredy, Great Bourton, Mollington and Wardington. =Methodist= A Primitive Methodist congregation developed in Claydon from 1835 and built a chapel in 1846. By 1969 it no longer had its own minister and was served by visiting clergy in the Banbury Methodist Circuit. The chapel has since closed and has been converted into a garage for the house next door. Economic and social history The Sunrising Inn was the last pub in Claydon and closed in 1990. It was a tied house of the Hunt Edmunds brewery of Banbury. The clockmakers Samuel Knibb (1625‚Äì70), Joseph Knibb (1640‚Äì1711) and John Knibb (1650‚Äì1722) were born at Claydon. Joseph and John were brothers and Samuel was a cousin. Samuel traded in Newport Pagnell from about 1655 to 1663, when he moved to London and went into a partnership making instruments as well as clocks. Joseph traded in Oxford from about 1663, but when Samuel died in 1670 Joseph moved to London and took over his business. John joined Joseph in Oxford in about 1664, took over their Oxford business when Joseph moved to London in 1670 and was Mayor of Oxford in 1697 and 1710. On 26 September 2010 the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board unveiled a blue plaque at Claydon to Samuel, Joseph and John Knibb. Historic houses in Claydon include Manor Farm built in 1720 and Claydon House. Claydon House is originally believed to be a 15th century tithe barn. It was owned in 1776 by one of the Knibb family. The house was recorded as the \\"Mill and Plough\\" in 1781 and was still serving ale until 1820. Later returning to a private residence it was purchased in 1867 by the vicar of Claydon, Rev. George.W. Palmer, to be the vicarage and was given to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in Oxford as a benefaction known as Claydon Vicarage. The property was altered that year by Edwin Dolby, the Victorian architect who altered a number of parish churches and vicarages. Claydon Vicarage was sold, on behalf of the Church Commissioners, in 1958 and it was subsequently renamed Claydon House and returned to being a private house. Between 1753 and 1763 Claydon had three public houses. By 1781 this had fallen to two, and from 1841 the number of pubs in the village fluctuated between one and two until the latter part of the 20th century. The New Inn had closed by 1969 and the Sunrising Inn closed in January 1990. The latter is now a private house, but still displays a white and blue enamel plaque of the Hunt Edmunds brewery of Banbury. On the Oxford Canal: Claydon Middle Lock, built 1776‚Äì77 Construction of the Oxford Canal began north of Coventry in 1769. In May 1776 it reached Fenny Compton in Warwickshire, northwest of Claydon. and by November 1777 the canal had been extended to Cropredy in Oxfordshire, passing through Claydon parish by skirting the north and east sides of the hill on which Claydon stands. On the east side of the hill the canal's engineer Samuel Simcock built Claydon Locks, a flight of five locks that begins the canal's southward descent from its 11-mile long summit pound. Between them the five locks achieve a total rise (i.e. change in water level) of . An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until 1776 when an Act of Parliament enclosed the common lands of the parish. In 1852 the Great Western Railway extended its Oxford and Rugby Railway through the western edge of Claydon parish to a new railway station at . In 1872‚Äì73 the East and West Junction Railway built a line from its Fenny Compton West railway station to through glebe land in the north of Claydon parish. Claydon's nearest station was to the south at , until British Railways closed it in 1956. Claydon and Clattercote School Board was established in 1875 and opened Claydon village school in 1877. The school closed in 1948. In 1932 the hamlet of Clattercote, south of Claydon, was added to the civil parish to form the present parish of Claydon with Clattercote. The village was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi Amenities The Bygones Museum at Butlin Farm in Claydon was founded in 1972.

Original circlotrons of 1950s used output transformers to couple relatively high output impedance of vacuum tubes to low-impedance loudspeakers. Circlotron architecture, easily scalable, was eventually adapted to operate without output transformers, and present-day commercially produced circlotron models are of output transformerless (OTL) type.  History  The Circlotron name emerged as a trademark of Electro-Voice. A U.S. patent for a circlotron High Fidelity Audio Amplifier was filed by Alpha Wiggins of Electro-Voice on March 1, 1954, and granted March 28, 1958.U.S. Patent 2,828,369 However, other inventors filed the same concept earlier:circlotron.tripod.com * C. T. Hall filed Parallel Opposed Power Amplifiers on June 7, 1951; U.S. Patent 2,705,265 was granted on March 29, 1955. * Tapio K√∂ykk√§ filed on September 2, 1952; Finnish Patent 27332 granted on November 10, 1954; improved version was filed on September 30, 1955, Finnish Patent 29642 granted on April 10, 1958. All these patents called for a transformer-coupled, fully balanced design; commercial transformerless amplifiers were not feasible at this time due to high costs of power supply capacitors required for an OTL design (at least thousands of microfarads at 200 volts or better). In the 1950s and 1960s, circlotrons were produced by Electro-Voice (eight models, 15 to 100 watts per channel), Finnish Voima and Philips. These inspired other local manufacturers, such as Carad. All these models employed output transformers and beam tetrode or pentode tubes (for increased efficiency). Similar amateur designs were published in the USSR. One can observe that the output stage of the successful McIntosh amplifier is a circlotron too because the special winding of the output transformer eliminates one of the two floating power supplies. The concept was resurrected in its transformerless form in early 1980s by Ralph Karsten, founder of Atma-Sphere, which remains the principal contemporary manufacturer of circlotrons. Other OTL circlotrons were made by Tenor Audio, Joule Electra and Einstein.  Basic transformerless schematic  Simplified diagram (omitting grid bias network) The electrical bridge of a circlotron is formed by a matched pair of triodes (V1, V2) and two floating power supplies ('B batteries'), B1+ and B2+. Grids of each triode are driven in opposite phases with a balanced, symmetrical input signal; differential current flows through the loudspeaker load and a simple, relatively high impedance, resistor network that ties floating supplies to the ground. Tubes are usually fixed biased with an external negative power supply ('C battery'); each side normally has independent bias adjustment to compensate for minor tube mismatch. Output impedance Z of a transformerless circlotron where each stage is a single triode with plate impedance of Rp and voltage gain of Œº is defined by the formula :Z = R_p / (2 + \\\\mu)See a comparison of OTL topologies and their output impedances Tube Lovers Anonymous The tubes best fitting the circlotron concept are triodes designed for use in power supplies as series regulators: 6080/6AS7, 6C33C, 6C19P. An amplifier with one 6AS7 dual triode per channel (Rp = 270 ohms,Actual Rp in a paralleled setting may be even higher due to conservative biasing Œº = 2) will have a Z of about 67 ohms‚Äîsufficient to drive most headphones. Driving loudspeakers requires paralleling output tubes, and in practice, V1 and V2 are not single triodes, but massive banks of paralleled triodes. Simple OTL amplifiers, for example Atma-Sphere M-60, employ 8 double triodes of 6AS7 type per channel; each continuously dissipates an average of 30 watts. Without feedback, this arrangement results in an output impedance of 6‚Äì8 ohms. It can be further lowered by applying global negative feedback or paralleling more output tubes. On the extreme end, Atma-Sphere MA-2 amplifier uses 20 6AS7 tubes per channel, with a continuous power consumption of 600 watts per channel (800 watts at maximum rated output of 220 watts, or a 27% maximum efficiency).  Benefits and drawbacks  Perceived fidelity (quality) of audio reproduction is a hardly quantifiable, subjective measure that should be left to each individual listener's taste. Apart from audio fidelity, circlotron OTL have certain benefits versus asymmetrical OTLs (i.e. Futterman amplifier) and conventional, transformer-coupled amplifiers: * Scalability. The same basic design can be easily scaled up or down by adding (removing) output tubes. * Loudspeaker safety. Even when either V1 or V2 bank fails completely, direct current through speaker is limited to non-destructive values. * Reliability. Failure in one triode (or a double-triode tube) can be offset by re-biasing the amplifier; it will continue operating, although at reduced maximum output and with increased even-order distortion caused by output stage asymmetry. * Linear frequency response and fast transient handling. Absence of output transformer and global negative feedback extends full power frequency response into hundreds of kilohertz. On the lower end of frequency scale, bass response is limited by power supply capacity and driver circuit, and can be easily extended below 1 hertz. These benefits are at the cost of high power consumption and concomitant heat generation: minimal stereo power amplifier (Atma-Sphere S-30) continuously dissipates 400 watts, while practical low-impedance stereo setups approach 1 kilowatt, the power of a small electric heater. Circlotrons, unlike minimalistic single-ended amplifiers, need to employ quite complex balanced input and driver stages delivering at least 100 V peak-to-peak voltage and able to drive relatively high capacitance loads (due to the number of paralleled power triodes and associated long wiring). The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two cathode followers inserted between the driver stage and the power stage. Both need a bipolar power supply, independent of the power stage power supplies, with power established before the power stage supply starts.

When first published in 2001 it became an international best- seller. A new edition was published in 2007 to include Gould's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory finished shortly before his death in 2002, and more recent works by Dawkins. The synopsis below is from the 2007 publication. Also Synopsis =Part I‚ÄîBattle Joined= In the introductory chapter the author points out that there have been many conflicts in biology. Still, few have been as public or as polemical as the one between Dawkins and Gould. Dawkins sees evolution as a competition between gene lineages, where organisms are vehicles for those genes. Gould, a palaeontologist in the tradition of George Gaylord Simpson, has a different perspective. For example, he sees chance as very important, and views organisms as being more important than genes. Their broader world views also differ, for instance they have very different beliefs about the relationship between religion and science. =Part II‚ÄîDawkins' World= This begins with a discussion on genes and gene lineages (chapter 2). Dawkins' view on the nature of evolution, as outlined in The Selfish Gene, has genes as the units of selection, both in the first replicators and in more complex organisms, where alliances of genes are formed (and sometimes broken). He then discusses in chapter 3, Dawkins' view of heritability, with genes as difference makers that satisfy replicator principles and have phenotypic power, increasing the likelihood of phenotypic expression, depending on environmental context. In chapter 4, he discusses aspects of genomes and genetic replication, using various examples. He notes that in a story about magpie aggression, \\"Dawkins' story will be about genes and vehicles\\", whereas Gould and others will describe it in terms of phenotypic fitness. (p. 39) He discusses ways in which genes \\"lever their way into the next generation\\", including genes that are loners, or 'Outlaws', and which promote their own replication at the expense of other genes in their organism's genome. He then discusses the role of extended phenotypes, in which genotypes that influence their environment further increase the likelihood of replication (chapter 4). Chapter 5 explores selfish genes and the selection within the animal kingdom of co-operation as opposed to altruism, levels of selection, and the evolution of evolvability itself. Sterelny notes that on the issue of high-level selection, \\"Dawkins and Gould are less sharp than they once were.\\" (p. 65) In chapter 6, Sterelny notes that \\"despite the heat of some recent rhetoric, the same is true of the role of selection in generating evolutionary change\\", (p. 67) and naive adaptationism. \\"Everyone accepts that many characteristics of organisms are not the direct result of selection\\", as in the example of redness of blood, which is a by-product of its oxygen-carrying properties. (p. 70) Numerous general truths are uncontroversial \\"though their application to particular cases may be. Nor is there disagreement between Gould and Dawkins on core cases\\", such as echolocation in bats, which \\"everyone agrees is an adaptation\\". (p. 71) They do however differ on the relative role of selection and variation. For example, they have different emphases on development. Developmental constraints are fundamental to Gould's approach. Dawkins gives this less weight, and has been more interested in enhanced possibilities open to lineages as a result of developmental revolutions. For example, the evolution of segmentation increases variation possibilities. He discusses this in Climbing Mount Improbable, and \\"returns to similar themes at the end of The Ancestor's Tale: major transitions in evolution are developmental transitions, transitions that make new variants possible, and hence new adaptive complexes possible\\". (pp. 77‚Äì78) \\"Gould, on the other hand, is inclined to bet that the array of possibilities open to a lineage is tightly restricted, often to minor variants of its current state.\\" (p. 78) Gould sees morphological stability as \\"probably explained by constraints on the supply of variation to selection\\". (p. 78) But whereas in his earlier work Gould considered variation supply as a brake on evolutionary change, in The Structure of Evolutionary Theory he carefully notes that it can also enhance possibilities for change. \\"So while both Dawkins and Gould recognise the central role of developmental biology in an explanation of evolutionary change, they make different bets as to what the role will be. Gould but not Dawkins thinks that one of these roles is as a brake\\", damping down change possibilities. (p. 78) Another difference is Dawkins conception of evolutionary biology's central problem as the explanation of adaptive complexity, whereas Gould has largely focused on the existence of large-scale patterns in the history of life that are not explained by natural selection. \\"A further disagreement concerns the existence and importance of these patterns\\", (p. 79) which leads on to Part III. =Part III‚ÄîThe View from Harvard (Gould)= In discussing Gould's perspective, Sterelny begins with two fundamental distinctions that Gould saw between his viewpoint and that of the Dawkins camp. Firstly, Gould thought that gene selectionists misrepresent the role of genes in microevolution, ascribing a causal role in evolution, rather than by-product record of evolutionary change. Moreover, evolutionary biologists have often neglected non-selective possibilities when formulating hypotheses about microevolutionary change. For example, contemporary sex differences in human males and females need not be adaptations, but could be evolutionary vestiges of a greater sexual dimorphism in ancestral species. But Gould's main target is 'extrapolationism', concerning the relationship between evolutionary processes occurring within species and those of large-scale life histories. In this view, the evolution of species lineages is an aggregate of events at the local population scale, with major changes being the additive result of minor changes over successive generations. While not disputing the relevance of this, Gould argued that it is not the whole truth. \\"Indeed, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that Gould's professional life has been one long campaign against the idea that this history of life is nothing but the long, long accumulation of local events.\\" (p. 86) Sterelny offers four highlights to illustrate this. Firstly, punctuated equilibrium, in which new species arise by a split in a parental species, followed by geologically rapid speciation of one or both of the fragments. A period of stasis then occurs until the species either becomes extinct or splits again. Gould argued that punctuated equilibrium challenges the gradual change expected by extrapolationists. In the case of Hominid evolution, there is the evolutionary trend of marked increase in brain size. To Gould, this trend was the result of species sorting, in which species with relatively larger brains were more likely to appear, or to survive. Secondly, in his Natural History writings, Gould often argued that the history of life was profoundly affected by mass extinctions caused by environmental catastrophes such as an asteroid impact causing the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, which wiped out pterosaurs, large marine reptiles and non- avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Such a mass extinction would be sudden at not just the larger geological time-scale, but also the more ephemeral ecological one. \\"The properties that are visible to selection and evolution in local populations‚Äîthe extent to which an organism is suited to life here and now\\" become irrelevant to survival prospects in mass extinction times. \\"Survival or extinction in mass extinction episodes determines the large-scale shape of the tree of life\\". Massive culling of synapsids at the end of the Permian \\"gave the dinosaurs their chance. The death of the dinosaurs opened the door for the radiation of mammals.\\" (p. 89) Thirdly, in Wonderful Life, Gould describes the Burgess Shale fauna, which is known in detail due to fortuitous preservation of both hard and soft tissue around 505 million years ago. Gould argues that the Burgess Shale fauna demonstrate both diversity of species and disparity of body plans. He accepts that diversity has probably increased over the last few million years, but argues that disparity of animal life peaked early in evolutionary history, with very little disparity generated since the Cambrian, and profound conservatism in surviving lineages. For example, despite diversity in beetle species their body plans follow the same general pattern. He argues that survival has been contingent, and that if the tape of life was replayed from the earliest Cambrian, with small alterations in the initial conditions, a different set of survivors may have evolved. Fourth, in The Spread of Excellence, \\"Gould argues that evolutionary trends are not the scaled-up consequences of competitive interactions among organisms.\\" (p. 90) For example, morphological changes in horses are not the cumulative result of the competitive success of horses better adapted to grazing. \\"Rather, Gould argues that this trend is really a change in the spread of variation within the horse lineage\\", which used to be species rich with a wide range of lifestyles and sizes. \\"But only a very few species survived, and those few happen to be largish horses. The average horse is larger now only because almost all horse species became extinct, and the few survivors happened to be somewhat atypical\\", and there is no evolutionary 'trend' towards increased size. (p. 91) Similarly with complexity. While complexity has increased over time, it is misleading to see this simply as a trend towards increased complexity, from simple organisms such as bacteria to complex organisms such as us. Rather, the distance from the least to the most complex living organism has increased. \\"The real phenomenon to be explained is this increase in variation rather than an upward trend in average complexity. There is, Gould argues, no such trend.\\" (p. 92) Sterelny notes two issues arising from consideration of Gould's case against extrapolationism. \\"Are the patterns in life's history that he claims to detect real? And do these patterns really show the existence of evolutionary mechanisms other than those operating at the scale of local populations?\\" (p. 92) Sterelny then outlines in chapter 8 Gould and Eldredge's punctuated equilibrium hypothesis. They argued that the appearance of stability in species evolution is not a mere effect of the gappiness and imperfection of the fossil record. Rather, it is the result of discontinuous tempos of change in the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time. Sterelny notes that this hypothesis has been misunderstood in two important ways. First, in some early discussions of the idea, the contrast between geological and ecological time was blurred, with Gould and Eldredge interpreted as claiming that species originate more or less overnight in a single step. However, Gould and Eldredge were referring to geological time, in which speciation taking 50,000 years would seem instantaneous relative to a species existence over millions of years. A second misunderstanding relates to further evolutionary change following speciation. They are not claiming that there is no generational change at all. \\"Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch describes this very process.\\" (p. 96) Sterelny notes that despite the fact that the fossil record represents, for several reasons, a biased sample, \\"the consensus seems to be shifting Gould's way: the punctuated equilibrium pattern is common, perhaps even predominant\\". Yet even if stasis is common \\"why suppose that this is bad news for the extrapolationist orthodoxy?\\" (p. 97) He notes that \\"the problem is not stasis but speciation. How can events in a local population generate a new species?\\" (p. 98) In discussing this issue, he notes \\"any solution to the speciation problem will take us beyond events in local populations observable on human timescales\\", and \\"it is likely that whatever explains the occasional transformation of a population into a species will rely on large-scale but rare climatic, biological, geographic or geological events; events which isolate populations until local change is entrenched\\". (p. 99) He notes that speciation is not just the accumulation of events in a local population, but dependent on the population's embeddedness into a larger whole. \\"There is a break with a strong version of extrapolationism, but it is not a radical break. Dawkins could, should, and probably would accept it; in The Ancestor's Tale, he has an inclusive view of speciation mechanisms.\\" (p. 100) Thus, while \\"Gould somewhat overstates the adherence of orthodoxy to strict extrapolationism\\", punctuated equilibrium is more important than some of the more \\"ungenerous treatment\\" that has been meted out. (pp. 100‚Äì101) In chapter 9, Sterelny discusses mass extinction, and notes Gould's hypothesis that mass extinctions are more frequent, rapid, intense and different in their effects than has been supposed. (p. 108) Moreover, Gould argues that during such extinctions, there are evolutionary principles that would enable the prediction of winners and losers. \\"The game has rules. But they are different rules from those of normal times ... Species survival is not random, but the properties on which survival depends are not adaptations to the danger mass extinction threatens. If a meteor impact caused a nuclear winter, then the ability to lie dormant would have improved your chances. But dormancy is not an adaptation to the danger of meteor impacts.\\" (p. 110) Similarly, \\"species with broad geographical ranges, species with broad habitat tolerances, species whose lifecycle does not tie them too closely to a particular type of community all would have had a better chance of making it\\", (p. 110) and this amounts to species selection. However, as Gould concedes, there are no well- worked-out case studies. \\"In short, Gould's case for the importance of mass extinction depends on the view that there is a qualitative difference between mass extinction and background extinction, and that major groups have disappeared that would otherwise have survived\\". (p. 113) A plausible but difficult to prove claim, as is the claim that mass extinction regimes are species selection regimes. In chapter 10, Sterelny discusses the fossil evidence of Cambrian fauna, and how this provides the basis for Gould's challenge to gradualistic orthodoxy. About 543 million years ago, at the base of the Cambrian, the Ediacaran fauna, characterised by small shelly fossils, fossilised tracks, and burrows, apparently disappeared. From available evidence, diversity of fauna was very limited at the beginning of the Cambrian Period. \\"By the middle of the Cambrian, about 520 million years ago, animal life was rich and diverse\\", (p. 116) as demonstrated by the Maotianshan Shales fossils, in Chengjiang, China, which \\"are as spectacular as the Burgess Shale fauna, and significantly older.\\" (p. 116) \\"Thus the fossil record seems to show that most of the major animal groups appeared simultaneously. In the 'Cambrian explosion', we find segmented worms, velvet worms, starfish and their allies, molluscs (bivalves, snails, squid and their relatives), sponges, brachiopods and other shelled animals appearing all at once, with their basic organisation, organ systems and sensory mechanisms already operational.\\" (p. 116) \\"This explosive evolutionary radiation of the Cambrian seems to be unique. Plants seem to have arisen somewhat more gradually ... nor was there a similar radiation when animals invaded the land ... the colonisation of the land saw no new ways of making an animal.\\" (p. 117) Despite adaptations, the basic body plans remain recognisable. One possibility is that the 'Cambrian explosion' is \\"an illusion generated by the failure of earlier Precambrian fossils to survive to our times,\\" (p. 117) that there is a long history of hidden evolution preceding the appearance of multi-celled animals in the fossil record. \\"This remains a live option. There are fossil embryos of animals from China dating to about 570 million years ago\\", (p. 120) and there are many animal lineages for which there is no fossil record, possibly due to being small and soft-bodied, so leaving no detectable traces. Certainly Precambrian animal life is evidenced by the Ediacaran fossils, but the relationship between fauna from these two periods remains unclear. Gould was inclined to support the view that the Ediacaran fauna became wholly extinct prior to the Cambrian, thus were not Cambrian ancestors, \\"hence their existence does not extend the timeframe of animal evolution into the Precambrian\\". (p. 120) However, the development of methods of calibrating rates of change in DNA sequences has given the ability to estimate the last common ancestor of various lineages. It also allows the obtaining of molecular clock dates for lineages without a fossil record, which shows that zero-fossil phyla are also ancient. Such information comes with important caveats in relation to methodology, including the underlying assumptions of each method. \\"However, even the youngest dates from molecular clocks place the origins of the deepest branches in the tree of animal life‚Äîwhere the sponges and jellyfish branch off from the other early animals‚Äîover 600 million years ago, and so quite deep in the Precambrian.\\" (p. 125) Gould accepted this, but noted that this does not negate the Cambrian Explosion. Molecular clocks date origins, while fossils date geographical spread and morphology. Molecular clock data cannot decide between gradual morphological change and rapid evolutionary bursts after initial species divergence. \\"Moreover, Gould argues that the fossil record supports the model in which the lineage splits much earlier than the distinctive morphologies evolve. For that explains why we find no Precambrian proto-arthropod fossils. In short, the 'hidden history' hypothesis remains an open option, but so does Gould's guess that the Cambrian explosion was genuinely explosive rather than an illusion generated by incomplete preservation.\\" (pp. 125‚Äì126) Of relevance to the explosive radiation hypothesis are the findings from the Cambrian sites: the Burgess (~505 myr), the Chengjiang (~522 myr), and the Sirius Passet formation in Greenland, which is dated at about 518 million years Before Present. Sterelny describes the distinction between disparity and diversity, and then explores Gould's claim that since the Cambrian, diversity has increased, but disparity has decreased. Since the Cambrian, not just species within phyla, but whole phyla themselves have become extinct. The major subdivisions of animal life are phyla, each of which is a distinctive way of building an animal. Gould's claim is that \\"the Cambrian phylum count was larger, maybe much larger, than the contemporary count. No new phyla have appeared, and many have gone. That count, in turn, is a reasonable measure of disparity. So Cambrian disparity was considerably larger than current disparity. The history of animal life is not a history of gradually increasing differentiation. It is a history of exuberant initial proliferation followed by much loss; perhaps sudden loss.\\" (p. 129) Gould doubted that selection played much role in either the early burst of disparity, the post-Cambrian conservativeness of evolution, or the roster of loss and survival. To Gould, there is a conservative pattern of history indicated by a reduction in disparity as measured by both the lack of new body plans and the lack of any major modifications of old ones. Given that evolution in general has not ceased in the past 500 million years, this poses a number of questions. However, Dawkins and more so his former student Mark Ridley think Gould's basic claim about history's pattern is incorrect. Central to Ridley's approach is cladistics, in which the purpose of biological systematics is to discover and represent genealogical relationships between species. Biological classifications are thus evolutionary genealogies, where only monophyletic groups (e.g. genera, families, orders, classes, phyla) are recognised and named. To cladists, similarity and dissimilarity are not objective features of the living world; they are products of human perceptions. Thus, whereas some morphological and physiological differences are more salient to us, and more striking or surprising, this is a fact about us, not the history of life. Conversely, genealogical reconstructions‚Äîwho is related to whom‚Äîare objective facts independent of the observer's perception. Sterelny discusses how both cladists and Dawkins think that Gould overestimates Cambrian disparity, and he notes that while the distinction between disparity and diversity is very plausible, in the absence of a good account of the nature of disparity, and objective measures, \\"the existence of Gould's puzzling pattern remains conjectural\\". (p. 141) Finally, in chapter 11, Sterelny discusses the \\"evolutionary escalator\\", or the tendency over time for life on earth to show a progressive increase both in complexity and adaptivity. While Gould does not outright reject this, he thinks it is a misleading way to think about the history of life. As above, with the example of horses, Gould argues that there has been no directional trend, but rather, a massive extinction in the horse lineage, with the surviving remnants happening to be largish grazers. So the appearance of a trend is generated by a reduction in heterogeneity. \\"A trend which is hostage to one switch between life and death is no trend at all.\\" (p. 146) At the scale of complexity, the same applies. \\"What we think of as a progressive increase in complexity is a change in the difference between the least and the most complex organism. It is a change in the spread of complexity.\\" (p. 146) Life starts in the simplest form that the constraints of chemistry and physics will allow, with bacteria probably close to that limit. \\"So life starts at the minimum level of complexity. Since even now nearly everything that is alive is a bacterium, for the most part life has stayed that way.\\" (p. 146) But occasionally life builds a lineage that becomes more complex over time. There are no global evolutionary mechanisms that either prevent more complex organisms evolving from simpler ones, or that make it more likely to occur. Complexity tends to drift up because the point of life's origin is close to the physical lower bound. Such complex creatures are relatively less than bacteria, which still dominate life, but the difference between the simplest and most complex organisms tends to become greater over time. So the increased range is wholly undirected. Displayed as a frequency distribution curve or histogram, the shape would be skewed to the right (i.e. positively skewed), with the mode near the left. Over time, the range would increase as average complexity drifts upwards. But the mode would remain at left, with the curve spreading to the right, because there is a wall imposed by the laws of the physical sciences to the left, but not to the right. To Gould, this upward drift in complexity is not the same as directional progress. 'Replaying the tape' of life's history would not guarantee the same outcomes, especially as mass extinction events make history utterly unpredictable. Conversely, Dawkins and Simon Conway Morris think that the course of evolutionary history is more predictable than does Gould. They argue that \\"convergent evolution is such a ubiquitous feature of evolution that the broad outline of evolution is highly predictable. Evolutionary pathways are constrained by both opportunity and possibility. There are not many ways of building working organisms, and so we can predict that evolution will move along this small set of pathways. Many of the most distinctive features of living systems have evolved more than once. Some of them (like eyes) have evolved many times.\\" (p. 149) Also, Dawkins thinks that evolution is progressive, not in an anthropocentric sense, but because over time life is becoming better adapted, although not in every aspect, as when local conditions change and organisms must move or readapt. \\"There is no reason to suppose that there is any arrow of overall improvement here.\\" (p. 150) However, Dawkins thinks that relationships between organisms and their enemies, such as predator-prey, or parasite-host relationships, are locked into a permanent arms race, and such lineages generate progressive change. \\"Both predator and prey will become absolutely more efficient in hunting and avoiding hunters, though their relative success with respect to one another may not change at all over time.\\" (p. 151) Thus progress is real though partial and intermittent. \\"Partial because it is generated only when selective regimes are both directional and stable: selecting for the same kind of phenotypic change over long periods, as in arms races ... intermittent because every arms race will ultimately be disrupted by large-scale environmental changes.\\" (p. 151) However, while they were in progress, each lineage was objectively improving. To Sterelny, Gould overstates his case, and \\"there is more to the history of life's complexity than a gradual increase in variance\\". (p. 151) He cites the 1995 work The Major Transitions in Evolution by John Maynard Smith and E√∂rs Szathm√°ry, in which life's history involves a series of major transitions and hence inherent directionality, with each transition facilitating possibilities for the evolution of more complex organisms. Dawkins pursues a similar, though less detailed, argument* in discussing the evolution of evolvability, in which a series of 'watershed events' make new life forms possible. These watersheds in evolvability comprise the evolution of sex, of multi-celled life together with a life cycle that takes large organisms through a single-celled reproduction stage, and the evolution of a modular mode of the development and construction of bodies. \\"Segmentation, for Dawkins, is a special case of modularity; of building a creature out of relatively discrete chunks. For once a chunk has been invented by evolution, it can be modified or redeployed without stuffing up the rest of the organism.\\" (p. 152) While Gould too is interested in evolvability, the crucial difference between Gould's view, and that of Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins, is in how they see the spread of complexity. To Gould, complexity drifts upward, having a lower boundary or wall to the left, \\"but no upper bound, and these features of complexity are fixed by biochemistry, not the course of evolutionary history\\". (p. 153) Maynard Smith and Szathmary consider that evolutionary history has had upper bounds, or walls to the right. For example, until eukaryotic life evolved, there was an upper bound of complexity set by the intrinsic limits on the size and structural complexity of prokaryotes, and for \\"perhaps 2 billion years, bacterial evolution was confined between these two limits.\\" (p. 153) Similarly, until a series of evolutionary innovations facilitated the evolution of multi-celled organisms, eukaryotic complexity was set by the limits on a single eukaryotic cell. \\"Maynard Smith and Szathmary argue that social existence, too, has evolutionary preconditions. Until these are met, a wall remains to the right.\\" (p. 153) Whereas to Gould, there are unchanging boundaries set by physics and chemistry, Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins view evolution as irreversibly transforming these boundaries. \\"The eukaryotic cell, sexual reproduction and cellular differentiation all change the nature of evolutionary possibility. These possibilities have changed over time in a direction that increases the maximum attainable complexity. In short, over time the rules of evolution change.\\" (pp. 153‚Äì154) So evolvability has changed, with developmental mechanisms determining the variation available to selection. Gould claims that bacteria dominate every age, including this one.* They are the world's most numerous organisms, have the most disparate metabolic pathways, and may constitute most of the world's biomass. \\"All this is true and important\\", with Dawkins making similar observations.*Dawkins, Richard (2004), chapter 39. \\"But it is not the whole truth. We live in an age in which many biological structures are now possible that were once not possible. That too is true, and important.\\" (p. 153) =Part IV‚ÄîThe State of Play= In Chapter 12, Sterelny notes that \\"Dawkins and his allies really do have a different conception of evolution from that embraced by Eldredge, Lewontin and other collaborators of Gould\\", but that this does not explain the undercurrent of hostility generated in the debate, as illustrated by a series of exchanges in the New York Review of Books. But the issues pertain mostly to matters internal to evolutionary theory, and apart from banal psychological explanations pertaining to human reaction to public criticism, Sterelny thinks that at core is their different attitudes to science itself. To Dawkins, science is not just a light in the dark, but \\"by far our best, and perhaps our only, light.\\" (p. 158) While not infallible, the natural sciences are society's one great engine for producing objective knowledge about the world, not just one knowledge system among many, and certainly not a socially constructed reflection of contemporary dominant ideology. Dawkins accepts that science cannot say what we should accept and reject, \\"but does not think of values as a special kind of fact that can be studied non-scientifically\\", notwithstanding that values are a kind of fact that anthropologists can and do study. \\"Least of all does he think religion has any special authority on values.\\" (p. 158) Gould's perspective is more ambiguous, in which some important questions are outside the scope of science, falling into the domain of religion. \\"On this issue, Dawkins' views are simple. He is an atheist. Theisms of all varieties are just bad ideas about how the world works, and science can prove that those ideas are bad. What is worse, as he sees it, these bad ideas have mostly had socially unfortunate consequences.\\" (pp. 158‚Äì159) In contrast, Gould thought theism is irrelevant to religion. \\"He interprets religion as a system of moral belief. Its essential feature is that it makes moral claims on how we ought to live. In Gould's view, science is irrelevant to moral claims. Science and religion are concerned with independent domains.\\" (p. 159) Sterelny considers Gould's views on religion \\"doubly strange\\". (p. 159) First, various religions make innumerable factual claims about the history of the world and how it works, and those claims are often the basis of moral injunctions. Second, Gould's conception of ethics seems strange. \\"Does he think that there are genuine ethical truths? Is there genuine moral knowledge?\\" (p. 159) Recent ethical thinking has two approaches to this question, with perhaps the main contemporary argument being the 'expressivist' view that moral claims express the speaker's attitude towards some act or individual. In this view \\"when, for instance, I call someone a scumbag, I do not describe a particular moral property of that person. Rather, I express my distaste for that person and their doings.\\" (pp. 159‚Äì160) The main alternative is 'naturalism', in which moral claims are based on facts, albeit complex, about human welfare. Gould seems to deny both options. \\"If 'expressivism' is right, there is no independent domain of moral knowledge to which religion contributes\\", with moral utterances reflecting not objective features of the world, but attitudes and opinions of the speakers. Conversely, \\"if naturalism is right, science is central to morality. For it discovers conditions under which we prosper.\\" (p. 159) Gould thinks that there are important domains of human understanding where science has no role, and moreover he is sceptical about science's role within its 'proper' domain. Nevertheless, he rejects extreme versions of postmodern relativism. Evolution is an objective fact, containing objective facts, and those facts are not just aspects of a Western creation myth reflecting the dominant ideology, or an element of the current palaeontological paradigm. \\"So to some extent Gould shares with Dawkins the view that science delivers objective knowledge about the world as it is.\\" (p. 161) But while science reflects objective evidence and is not a mere socio- cultural construction \\"Gould argues that science is very deeply influenced by the cultural and social matrix in which it develops\\", (p. 161) with many of his writings illustrating the influence of social context on science, and its ultimate sensitivity to evidence. These writings \\"began as reflections on natural history; they ended as reflections on the history of natural history\\". (p. 161) Gould's Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle (first published in 1987) \\"locates the development of our conception of deep history in its cultural and intellectual context without any suggestion that that cultural context perverted the development of geology\\", whereas \\"in Wonderful Life, Gould argued that the Burgess Shale fauna were misunderstood because they were interpreted through the ideology of their discoverer\\". (p. 162) The Mismeasure of Man is Gould's most famous work on the themes of socio-cultural interests leading to bad science, pseudo-science, racist and sexist science, where \\"a particular ideological context led to a warped and distorted appreciation of the evidence on human difference\\". (p. 162) Thus, \\"one sharp contrast between Dawkins and Gould is on the application of science in general, and evolutionary biology in particular, to our species\\". (p. 162) Yet paradoxically, Dawkins' most systematic writings on human evolution explore the differences between human evolution and that of most other organisms, in which humans pass on their values through ideas and skills which Dawkins calls memes. To Dawkins, ideas are often like pathogens or parasites, replicating throughout human populations, sometimes quite virulently, with evangelical religion being a salient example. Doubts about the reliability and accuracy of idea replication suggest Dawkins' own view of cultural evolution may not work. But his general approach has gained some popularity, as illustrated by works which explore the interaction between cultural and biological evolution, such as Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd's Not By Genes Alone,. as well as Eytan Avital and Eva Jablonka's Animal Traditions. \\"So though Dawkins approaches human behaviour using different tools to those of standard sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists, he is fully committed to the idea that we can understand ourselves only in an evolutionary framework.\\" (pp. 164‚Äì165) This contrasts with Gould. While \\"Of course\\" he accepts that humans are an evolved species, \\"Everything that Gould does not like in contemporary evolutionary thinking comes together in human sociobiology and its descendant, evolutionary psychology. The result has been a twenty-year campaign of savage polemic against evolutionary theories of human behaviour. Gould hates sociobiology\\". And \\"It is true that some evolutionary psychology does seem simple-minded,\\" such as Randy Thornhill's \\"unconvincing\\" attempt to argue that a tendency towards rape is an evolutionary adaptation. (p. 165) However, contemporary evolutionary psychologists, and especially biological anthropologists, have accepted the need for caution in testing adaptationist hypotheses. (p. 165) However, even the most disciplined sociobiological approaches reflect different approaches to evolution to that exemplified by Gould. They \\"tend not to emphasise the importance of development and history in imposing constraints on adaptation, the problems in translating microevolutionary change into species-level change, the role of contingency and mass extinction in reshaping evolving lineages, or the importance of paleobiology to evolutionary biology\\", (p. 166) which likely played a part in Gould's hostility. But Sterelny suspects more most of all, Gould thought \\"these ideas are dangerous and ill- motivated as well as wrong. They smack of hubris, of science moving beyond its proper domain, and incautiously at that\\". Conversely, to Dawkins, knowledge of evolutionary underpinnings to human behaviour is potentially liberating, and \\"might even help us to escape the poisoned chalice of religion\\". (p. 166) Finally, in chapter 13, Sterelny summarises the fundamental contrasts between the views of Dawkins and Gould. In Dawkins' argument, selection acts on lineages of replicators, which are mostly but not exclusively genes. Ideas and skills are the replicators in animals capable of social learning, and \\"the earliest replicators were certainly not genes\\". (p. 167) Genetic competition occurs through vehicle-building alliances, with selection dependent on repeatable influences on those vehicles. Other genetic replication strategies include Outlaws, the prospects of which are enhanced at the expense of vehicle adaptiveness. And extended phenotype genes advantageously enhance their environment. The vehicles of Dawkins replicators need not be individuals, but can also be groups, although animal co-operation is not sufficient to claim group selection. Evolution's central explanatory imperative is the existence of complex adaptation, which can only be explained by natural selection. This complex adaptation evolves gradually, with occasional replication errors resulting in large but survivable phenotypic change. Humans are unusual species in that they are vehicles for memes as well as genes, although humans are not exempt from evolutionary biological explanations. Extrapolationism is a sound working theory, with most evolutionary patterns the result of microevolutionary change over vast geological time. Major animal lineages are the result of ordinary speciation processes, although possibility-expanding changes may result in some form of lineage-level selection. In contrast, Gould sees selection as usually acting on organisms in a local population, although in theory and practice, it can occur at many levels, with change at one level often affecting future options at other levels. Selection can occur at the group level, with some species lineages having characteristics which make extinction less likely, or speciation more likely. And while rare, selection can occur on genes within an organism. While selection is important, and requires understanding, it is just one of many factors explaining microevolutionary events and macroevolutionary patterns. Further, complex adaptations are but one phenomenon explanations in evolutionary biology. Extrapolationism is not a good theory, with large-scale patterns in the history of life not explainable by extrapolating from measurable events in local populations. Evolutionary biology needs a theory of variation, explaining the effect of variation supply on change potentiality. While humans are evolved animals, attempts to explain human behaviour using techniques from evolutionary biology have largely failed, \\"vitiated by one-sided understanding of evolutionary biology. They have often been biologically naive.\\" (p. 170) Sterelny notes that these debates remain alive and developing, with no final adjudication possible as yet. \\"But we can say something about how the argument has developed.\\" (p. 170) He claims that \\"the idea that gene-selectionist views of evolution are tacitly dependent on reductionism and genetic determinism is a mistake. Dawkins and the other gene selectionists do not think that nothing happens in evolution but changes in gene frequency.\\" (p. 170) They do not deny the significance of the organism or phenotype, which they see as vehicles of selection, or 'survival machines', which interact with other survival machines and with the environment in ways replication of the genes whose vehicles they are. But there are other replication-enhancing strategies apart from organism construction. Extended phenotypes, as exemplified by parasitic species, are common and important, with probably all parasitic gene pools including \\"genes whose adaptive effects are on host organisms.\\" (p. 171) And \\"the outlaw count is unknown, but it is growing all the time\\", and may transpire to be more common than thought. Sterelny notes that \\"gene selectionism is not determinism. No gene selectionist thinks that there is typically a simple relationship between carrying a particular gene and having a particular phenotype\\". While they exist, such as the sickle-cell haemoglobin gene, they are the exception not the rule. Gene-selectionist ideas are compatible with context dependence of gene action, but they do assume some reasonable regular relationship between a specific gene in an organism's genotype, and some aspect of the organism's phenotypic expression. They assume that within gene lineages, the effect on their vehicles will be fairly similar. \\"So while gene selectionists are not genetic determinists, they are making a bet on developmental biology. When revitalised to reoccurring features of context, gene action will turn out to be fairly systematic. There is no reason to suppose that this hunch is false, but it is not known to be true.\\" (p. 172) Developmental biology is relevant to this debate in another important way: \\"The role of selection in evolution. Gould is betting that when the facts of developmental biology are in, it will turn out that the evolutionary possibilities of most lineages are highly constrained\\", with some characteristics \\"frozen\\" into their respective lineages. \\"They are developmentally entrenched. That is, these basic organisational features are connected in development to most aspects of the organism's phenotype, and that makes them hard to change.\\" (p. 172) And \\"since variation in these frozen-in features is unlikely, selection is not likely to be important in explaining their persistence\\", (p. 173) and Gould thinks 'frozen accidents' are important in explanations of evolutionary patterns found in the fossil record. Conversely, Dawkins thinks that over time, selection can alter the range of a lineage's evolutionary possibilities. \\"So he thinks both that selection has a larger range of variation with which to work, and that when patterns do exist over long periods ... selection will have played a stabilising role.\\" (p. 173) The integration of evolution and development \\"is the hottest of hot topics in contemporary evolutionary theory, and this issue is still most certainly open\\". In discussing the effects of mutations, Sterelny's \\"best current guess is that developmental biology probably does generate biases in the variation that is available to selection, and hence that evolutionary trajectories will often depend both on selection and these biases in supply\\" (173), vindicating Gould's view that developmental biology is crucial to explaining evolutionary patterns. (p. 174) \\"But it is harder to see how to resolve some of Gould's other claims about the large-scale history of life. Despite the plausibility of the distinction between disparity and diversity, we are not close to constructing a good account of disparity and its measurement\\". (p. 174) Further, convergent evolution belies the unpredictability that Gould supposes. However, \\"most examples of convergence are not independent of evolutionary experiments. For they concern lineages with an enormous amount of shared history, and hence shared developmental potential\\", as in \\"the standard example of streamlining in marine reptiles, sharks, pelagic bony fish like the tuna, and dolphins\\". (p. 175) Further, \\"the scale is not large enough. The fact that eyes have often evolved does not show that had, say, the earliest chordates succumbed to a bit of bad luck (and become extinct), then vertebrate-like organisms would have evolved again.\\" (p. 175) Moreover, Gould's main concern is not with adaptive complexes, which are the source of the above, oft-cited examples, \\"but with body plans‚Äîbasic ways of assembling organisms.\\" Sterelny thinks that \\"we have to score Gould's contingency claims as: 'Don't know; and at this stage don't know how to find out'\\". (p. 175) Gould seems right that mass extinctions played a role in shaping evolutionary history, and \\"is probably right that extinction works by different rules in mass extinction regimes\\". (p. 176) Some ideas are difficult to assess, such as whether mass extinctions filter out the features of species or of individuals comprising species. It is also difficult to tell how fundamental is the disagreement between Gould and Dawkins on this. But Sterelny's bet is that Gould may be right in thinking that survival or extinction in mass extinction depends on species properties. \\"However, it has proved hard to find really clear, empirically well-founded examples to back up this hunch.\\" (p. 176) It was once thought that sexual reproduction was maintained by species selection, which Sterelny outlines. He notes however that \\"this idea has recently fallen on hard times\\", with new individual-based ideas being developed. Further, species-level maintenance of sexual reproduction \\"has a problem: sex does not always promote evolvability\\", breaking up as well as creating advantageous gene combinations. (p. 177) \\"So it has been hard to find really convincing examples of species-level properties that are built by species-level selection. The problem is to find: (i) traits that are aspects of species, not the organisms making up the species; (ii) traits that are relevant to extinction and survival; and (iii) traits that are transmitted to daughter species, granddaughter species and so forth\\". And \\"transmission to daughter species is especially problematic\\". (p. 177) In the end, Sterelny states his own views are much closer to Dawkins than to Gould's, especially regarding microevolution‚Äîchange within local populations. \\"But macroevolution is not just microevolution scaled up; Gould's paleontological perspective offers real insights into mass extinction and its consequences, and, perhaps, the nature of species and speciation\\". And Gould is considered right to expand the explanatory agenda of evolutionary biology to include large-scale patterns in life's history. \\"So, Dawkins is right about evolution on local scales, but maybe Gould is right about the relationship between events on a local scale, and those on the vast scale of paleontological time.\\" (p. 178) =Suggested reading= The Suggested Reading section for each chapter is an extension of the chapter, aimed at pointing the reader in the direction of material that may assist their understanding of the issues under discussion.

An alternate return route passes by Tiberias, the Jordan River, Mount Tabor, and Mount Precipice.Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (2010). 1:50,000 topographical map #3, \\"Lower Galilee\\" (Hebrew language map)  History  View of Sea of Galilee from top of Mount Arbel Tabgha pool Capernaum Mount Tabor The trail was founded in 2007 by two hiking enthusiasts, Maoz Inon, a Jewish Israeli entrepreneur who has established hostels and guesthouses in Israel, and David Landis, a Christian American hiking specialist. The actual marking of the trail took place in 2008. It is currently managed and promoted largely by the work of volunteers, and is a non-profit project. The trail is public and free for anyone who wants to hike and camp along its course. The Jesus Trail is marked with a blaze of three stripes painted on rocks along the way (white, orange, and white). When portions of the Jesus Trail combine with other trails (such as the Israel National Trail), an additional orange circle is added to the previous trail marker. All marking of the trail was completed by the public Israel Trails Committee (ITC) which works in conjunction with the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI). Trail maintenance and cleaning up has been a combined effort of international, national, and local organizations including JNF-KKL (The Jewish National Fund), the Fauzi Azar Inn in Nazareth, village schools, and international volunteers. The biblical reference for the Jesus Trail is based on a verse from the New Testament Gospel of Matthew wherein at the start of Jesus' public ministry he is described as moving from his home- town of Nazareth, located in the hills of the Galilee, down to Capernaum which was a lakeside fishing village on the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus is described as gathering his first disciples. The account is also related in the two other synoptic gospels of Mark and Luke. The reference in the Gospel of Matthew reads: \\"Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum which was by the lake.\\" (Matthew 4:13). According to the Gospels, Capernaum became the home base for Jesus' ministry: \\"And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city [referring to Capernaum].\\" (Matthew 9:1); also: \\"And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.\\" (Mark 2:1). On the official Jesus Trail Homepage Maoz Inon and David Landis explain the Jesus Trail philosophy: \\"We hope that travelers of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds will gain a new understanding of the life of Jesus through the people and land that shaped his historical context along the Jesus Trail. Today, encounters on the trail still serve as opportunities to extend and receive hospitality with diverse groups of people. Modern travelers can practice living simply and traveling light, gaining wisdom from the spirit of Jesus‚Äô words from Mark 6:8-9: \\"Take nothing for the journey except a staff‚Äîno bread, no bag, no money in your belts. Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.\\" The Jesus Trail was designed in the tradition of pilgrimage hiking trails around the world, such as the Camino de Santiago de Compostela (the Way of Saint James) in northern Spain and the Saint Paul Trail in Turkey. The medieval practice of religious pilgrimage has seen a resurgence in recent years, with almost 200,000 hikers per year on the Camino de Santiago in the first decade of the 21st century. Target group The trail is geared for Christians who seek a pilgrimage route that allows for a more personal experience of the Galilee and sites from the life of Jesus, but integrates historical sites from different eras, sites sacred to other religions, nature sites, breathtaking panoramas and hiking for those who seek a physical challenge. The Gospel Trail is a similar hiking path that opened in November 2011 to attract Christian tourism to Israel, which accounts for two-thirds of all incoming tourism.  Sections of the trail  Jesus Trail Mark Mount of Beatitudes and Sea of Galilee The geography and distances involved naturally allow the Jesus Trail to be walked as a series of day-hikes for a total of four days, with each day's hike being between 13 and 19 km (8 to 12 mi) in length. * 1st Day: Nazareth to Cana via Sepphoris * 2nd Day: Cana to Kibbutz Lavi * 3rd Day: Kibbutz Lavi to Moshav Arbel * 4th Day: Moshav Arbel to Capernaum via Mount of Beatitudes = Details of the four sections = * Day 1: Nazareth to Cana via Sepphoris ‚Äì The trail starts in center of Nazareth at the Church of the Annunciation, goes through the Old City of Nazareth and then ascends via steep stairways to the ridge overlooking the city. From there the trail goes out into agricultural fields towards the extensively excavated ancient city of Tsippori (Sepphoris). After passing through the Arab village of Mash'had the trail arrives at Kafr Kanna, the traditional site of the New Testament account of Jesus turning water into wine. * Day 2: Cana to Kibbutz Lavi ‚Äì After leaving Cana, the trail goes almost entirely along forests and through natural and cultivated fields to end at the outskirts of the modern Jewish agricultural commune (Hebrew: kibbutz) of Lavi, which is located near the hill of the Horns of Hattin. * Day 3: Kibbutz Lavi to Moshav Arbel ‚Äì This hike goes from hilltop to hilltop, from the panoramic view at the Horns of Hattin, past the Druze shrine of Nabi Shu'ayb in the small Arbel Valley, through striking scenery of a historically dense landscape, to end near the Jewish agricultural cooperative (Hebrew: moshav) of Arbel. * Day 4: Moshav Arbel to Capernaum via Mount of Beatitudes ‚Äì After ascending Mount Arbel there is a climb down the cliff to come out on a small fertile agricultural plain adjacent to the lake known as the Sea of Galilee (Kinneret). Then the trail arrives at the northern shore of the lake to the church at Tabgha which commemorates the New Testament account of Jesus feeding the multitudes, then to the church and gardens at the Mount of Beatitudes, which commemorates the Sermon on the Mount, and then finally arriving at the ancient lakeside fishing village of Capernaum with its extensive ruins and modern church.

It is based on the 1962 publication of Walter Tappolet, Das Marienlob der Reformatoren. Mary Through The Ages is a collection of texts from Martin Luther, John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and Heinrich Bullinger, whom Pelikan called \\"the Reformers in Praise of Mary\\". Reformers in praise of Mary Mary Through the Centuries: Her Place in the History of Culture includes sermons, theological works, and devotion-oriented text to document his claim that the Protestant reformers continued the traditional Catholic teachings on Mary in such areas as perpetual virginity and Theotokos. Biblical texts which might cast shadows or raise questions are interpreted in line with Catholic teachings. Thus, the biblically mentioned brothers of Jesus ‚Äì whose existence would undermine the claim of the perpetual virginity of Mary ‚Äì were actually cousins according to Martin Luther. Luther clearly opposed what he considered Catholic exaggerations of Mary, but her strong faith is to him, according to Pelikan, a model of a Christian life lived by faith alone (sola fide): \\"Mary became the obvious case study of this for Luther, as the opening words of Mary's Magnificat showed him that 'holiness of spirit... consists in nothing else than faith pure and simple.'\\" Mary Through the Centuries takes issue with the notion that the Marian views of Luther and other reformers are nothing but traces of the past. Mary is vital for their theology centering on the divinity of Christ. Thus Mary is, in the theology of Martin Luther, \\"the guarantee of the reality of the incarnation and of the human nature of Christ.\\" Controversial views Mary Through the Centuries addresses also controversial theological topics such as \\"the development of Mariology within the Catholic Church\\" over the centuries and, by implications, the last two Marian dogmas of 1854 and 1950. For biblical scholars and sola scriptura theologians, this is a difficult topic. Mary Through the Centuries views development positively and points out that other Christian beliefs, not contained in the Bible as such, were formulated later as well, such as the concept of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed, a view which raised discussion and controversy.

It was held as a 128-player tournament from 27 November to 17 December 2005 in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. The top ten finishers qualified for the candidates matches of the World Chess Championship 2007. One of them (√âtienne Bacrot) had already qualified for the candidates matches via rating, freeing the place for the eleventh player at the World Cup (Vladimir Malakhov). The World Cup was won by Armenian grandmaster Levon Aronian. Background The 2005 World Cup was part of the cycle for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. Three of the players at the World Cup, Levon Aronian, Alexander Grischuk and Boris Gelfand, went on to qualify for the World Championship, which was held as an eight-player double round-robin event, with Gelfand finishing third. Four top finishers of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 (Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler and Alexander Morozevich) were already invited to the World Championship 2007 and thus exempt from the World Cup. Playing conditions The tournament was in the style of the FIDE World Chess Championships between 1998 and 2004: each round consisted of a two-game match, followed by tie breaks at faster time controls if required. In rounds 1‚Äì3 losing players were eliminated. However, in rounds 4‚Äì6 defeated players progressed to the next round, to determine standings of the 16 best players. The time control for regular games was 90 minutes for the first 40 moves and 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with 30 seconds added after each move. Tie breaks consisted of two rapid chess games (25 minutes each + 10 seconds per move); followed by two blitz games if required (5 minutes + 10 seconds per move); followed by a single Armageddon chess game if required (white has 6 minutes and must win, black has 5 minutes and only needs to draw). Qualification The following players qualified for the World Cup: *Three of the four semi-finalists of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 (Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Michael Adams and Teimour Radjabov); the fourth semi-finalist, Veselin Topalov, was the reigning FIDE World Champion and already had a berth in the next championship. *Women's World Champion 2004 (Antoaneta Stefanova). *Junior World Champion 2004 (Pendyala Harikrishna). *22 players with the highest Elo rating.

She was the second daughter of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais and Princess Augusta of Bavaria, and a member of the House of Beauharnais. In 1826 she married Constantine, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. Life =Early years= Schloss Eugensberg in 1850 Born and raised as a Catholic, Eug√©nie grew up in the Palais Leuchtenberg on Ludwigstra√üe in Munich and frequently spent the summer months with her parents at Schloss Eugensberg, a castle built by her father on Lake Constance (at what is now Salenstein). The family's behaviour was princely in every aspect - the French envoy Coulomb wrote in 1822: \\"Prince Eug√®ne de Beauharnais lives in greater luxury than [Napoleon's] court\\". Their palace in Munich had been built by the famous Bavarian architect Leo von Klenze for over 2 million guilders. Besides Munich and Schloss Eugensberg, the family had manors at Eichst√§tt and Ismaning. On her father's death in 1824, Eug√©nie inherited Schloss Eugensberg. =Marriage= On 22 May 1826, Eug√©nie married the Catholic Hereditary Prince Constantine of Hohenzollern-Hechingen in Eichst√§tt. Eug√©nie brought Hofkavalier Gustav von Billing (born in Leuchtenberg) to Hechingen as her financial advisor - he managed her large dowry on her mother's behalf and quickly won Constantine's trust as an advisor. From 1833 on, Eug√©nie and her husband lived at Schloss Lindich near Hechingen, the residence city of the House of Hohenzollern- Hechingen, though they also spent much of the summer months at Schloss Eugensberg, thus keeping in contact with her aunt Hortense and her cousin Louis Napoleon, who later became Napoleon III. =Life in Hechingen= Eug√©nie had a great lust for life and even hunted deer with her husband in 1831. The couple took many trips to Munich, to Schloss Eugensburg by Lake Constance, to Schloss Tegernsee in Tegernsee, the summer residence of the kings of Bavaria, and in 1833 a Grand Tour to Italy, which lasted nearly 18 months and went as far as Sicily. Villa Eugenia in Hechingen Eug√©nie then sold Schloss Eugensberg for 32,000 guilders to Heinrich von Kiesow of Augsburg.Thurgauer Zeitung vom Mittwoch, 14 January 2004, Ressort Untersee und Rhein The proceeds of that sale financed her rebuilding of Villa Eugenia in Hechingen, where the couple took up residence in 1834. At the southern edge of the villa's park, she acquired the Gasthaus Zur Silberburg and in 1844 rebuilt it as another villa, to house visiting noble relations. The surrounding gardens were also bought up and redesigned as an English landscape, now known as the F√ºrstengarten. Some of the couple's famous guests at Hechingen included her cousin Napoleon III, Hector Berlioz, and Franz Liszt. The Hofkapelle had a good choir, and from 1843 the villa hosted Sunday concerts by members of the Museumsgesellschaft (museum society) and the Musikvereins (music society). Bust of Eug√©nie de Beauharnais at the Kinderbewahranstalt in Hechingen which she founded She remained childless and sought comfort in increasing piety, setting up an old- people's home in Hechingen and (in 1839) a major Kinderbewahranstalt for the town (the building which housed the latter contains a bust of her and is now the Amtsgericht). The latter was set up for those children whose parents \\"were often hindered by business or domestic difficulties, at home or in the fields, from bringing up their small children.\\" For ten years she attended her father- in-law Frederick, mortally ill from war injuries, who died in 1838 at Schloss Lindich. Every Maundy Thursday, Eug√©nie and her husband washed the feet of twelve old and needy local people and then invited them to an Apostelmahl or Last Supper in the Billardh√§uschen in the F√ºrstengarten, at which (after a grace) a stockfish with sauerkraut was passed round. Eug√©nie became ill with tuberculosis and in winter 1846 moved into the so-called Hofk√ºche directly behind the Villa Eugenia, since it could be better heated. Her doctors gave her odd treatments, including the inhalation of fumes from cow dung and the burning of moxa sticks on her chest. Due to the risk of spreading the disease, she could only see her husband rarely, and even then only at a distance. In summer 1847 she set off to seek a cure at the Badenweiler spa, but on the return journey she died at the Hotel Post in Freudenstadt on 1 September 1847. She was buried in the vault before the high altar of the Stiftskirche in Hechingen. On her mother's request, her heart was placed in an urn in the chapel of the Palais Leuchtenberg in Munich; since 1952 it has been housed in a niche beside the choir steps on the right side of the Stiftskirche. In her will she left her fortune of 273,000 guilders to charity.  Honours  * Dame of the Order of Saint Elizabeth.

History  Although various \\"concert\\" pieces have been written across history (such as Liszt's Trois √©tudes de concert and Grand solo de concert), concertos for solo piano are very rare. The first (and still best known) example comes from Johann Sebastian Bach, whose Italian Concerto, BWV 971, was published in 1735. Even though it was written for two-manual harpsichord, it is regularly played on the piano and considered the first example of a concerto fitted to solo keyboard. Schumann's Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor (1835), Op. 14, was labelled by Tobias Haslinger as a \\"Concerto without orchestra\\". The French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote in 1857 his set of Op. 39 √©tudes, of which nos. 8‚Äì10 were labelled as a concerto for solo piano. It includes markings such as \\"Tutti\\", \\"Solo\\" and \\"Piano\\", as well as instrumental directions such as \\"quasi-trombe\\" and \\"quasi-celli\\". The Spanish composer Joaqu√≠n Turina wrote in 1935 his Concerto Without Orchestra (Spanish: Concierto sin orquesta), Op. 88. The Russian composer and violinist Joseph Achron wrote in 1941 his final work Concerto for solo piano, op. 74. Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji's Concerto da suonare da me solo e senza orchestra, per divertirmi (1946) is clearly inspired by Alkan; for instance, the third movement of the work is titled Scherzo diabolico‚Äîa reference to Alkan's √âtude Op. 39 No. 3. In addition to that, the first movement of the work contains various programmatic indications. These, however, are controversial, since they effectively refer to an imaginary orchestra. However, it has also been argued that the orchestra is represented in the work by means of bitonal relationships.Abrahams, Simon John, Ph.D., Le mauvais jardinier: A Reassessment of the Myths and Music of Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, King's College London, 2002, pp. 209‚Äì210.

The French businessman, Jean de Gribaldy, took over sponsorship the following year with Frimatic, another maker of washing machines, as main backer. Caput went with him to run the team but, said, Lebreton, his organisation was chaotic. \\"The de Gribaldy team was badly organised. We were told we were to ride raced only a few hours before they started. It was a bazaar, and I wanted to leave.\\" Caput ran the team from 1968 to 1969.

She was a granddaughter of Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, Napoleon's first wife.  Biography  The fifth of the seven children of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais (1781‚Äì1824), Duke of Leuchtenberg, and his wife, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788‚Äì1851), Th√©odolinde was born in Mantua, Italy, and presumably named for Theudelinda, a 6th-century queen of the Lombards. She had two brothers (Auguste and Maximilian) and three surviving sisters (Jos√©phine, Eug√©nie, and Am√©lie). Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napol√©on Bonaparte and former Empress of France, was her paternal grandmother. The latter, however, died about six weeks after Th√©odolinde's birth. Through her marriage to Friedrich Wilhelm Alexander Ferdinand, Count of W√ºrttemberg, Th√©odolinde became Countess (Gr√§fin) of W√ºrttemberg, but died before her husband was created Duke of Urach. She died after a short illness on the morning of 1 April 1857 in Stuttgart, Germany, and was buried in the family vault at Ludwigsburg Palace, with her heart buried at the Hauskapelle of the palace in Munich. She was the subject of an 1840 portrait by Friedrich D√ºrck. Marriage and issue On 8 February 1841, at the age of 26, she was married in Munich to Wilhelm, Count of W√ºrttemberg (afterwards Duke of Urach), whose father, Wilhelm Friedrich of W√ºrttemberg, was a younger brother of Friedrich II, the last Duke of W√ºrtemberg, whom Napoleon later (1806) elevated to the status of King of W√ºrttemberg, as Friedrich I. He was also a cousin of Princess Catharina of W√ºrttemberg (1783‚Äì1835), who became the second wife of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, Napoleon's youngest brother, in 1807. Four daughters were born from this marriage: * Princess Augusta Eugenie of Urach (1842‚Äì1916) ** Married first Count Rudolf von Enzenberg zum Freyen und Jochelsthurn (1835‚Äì1874) and second Count Franz von Thun und Hohenstein (1826‚Äì1888). Both of her marriages produced issue. Among her descendants belongs Danielle, Freiin von und zu Bodman (wife of prince Inigo von Urach, current pretender of Lithuanian throne). * Princess Marie Josephine of Urach (1844‚Äì1864). * Princess Eugenia Amalie of Urach (1848‚Äì1867). * Princess Mathilde of Urach (1854‚Äì1907) ** Married Paolo Altieri, Prince of Oriolo and Viano (1849‚Äì1901), by whom she had issue.

Now in ruins, it is located at the edge of the city of Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin) in Armavir Province of Armenia.  History  Aerial view of the entire complex Zvartnots was built at a time when much of Armenia had just recently been overrun by the Muslim Arabs who were progressively occupying the Sasanian Persia/Iran of which Armenia was a part at the time. Construction of the cathedral began in 643 under the guidance of Catholicos Nerses III (nicknamed Shinogh or the Builder). Dedicated to St. Gregory, it was located at the place where a meeting between King Trdat III and Gregory the Illuminator was supposed to have taken place. According to the medieval Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi, the cathedral was consecrated in 652. Stepanyan, A. and H. Sargsyan. ‘∂’æ’°÷Ä’©’∂’∏÷Å [Zvart'nots]. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1977, vol. 3, pp. 707-710. From 653 to 659, Nerses was in Tayk and the construction of the cathedral continued under Anastas Akoratsi. Following the Arab occupation of Dvin and the intensifying wars between the Byzantine and Arab armies on the former's eastern borders, Nerses transferred the patriarchal palace of the Catholicos from Dvin to Zvartnots.Maranci, Christina. \\"Byzantium through Armenian Eyes: Cultural Appropriation and the Church of Zuart'noc'.\\" Gesta 40 (2001): p. 109. The exterior church design, featuring basket capitals with Ionic volute mounts, eagle capitals, and vine scroll friezes reveals the influence of Syrian and northern Mesopotamian architecture.Richard Krautheimer. Early Christian and Byzantine Church Architecture, 4th ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1986, pp. 322-23. Zvartnots stood for 320 years before its collapse in the 10th century; by the time the historian Stepanos Taronatsi wrote of the church it was already in ruins, without giving a reason. How it collapsed is still debated, though most argues for one of two theories; earthquake, or as a result of Arab raids. The most common explanation is earthquake, though the building was well engineered and designed to last 1,000 years (a projected date for the second coming of Christ). Excavations have uncovered traces of large fires at the site, perhaps of an earlier attempt to destroy the church, though the construction also included firing of obsidian and lime mortar to form the mortar joints (firing it into brick) and the 1893 excavation used fire and explosives to clear debris. A close copy of the cathedral was erected at Ani out by Trdat the Architect under the reign of Gagik I Bagratuni during the final decade of the tenth century. The contemporary Armenian historian Stepanos Taronetsi referred to Zvartnots when describing the church that Gagik I had inaugurated as \\"a large structure at Va≈Çar≈°apat [Vagharshapat], dedicated to the same saint that had fallen into ruins.\\"Maranci. \\"Byzantium through Armenian Eyes\\", p. 118.  Excavations  The remaining ruins of Zvartnots were uncovered at the beginning of the twentieth century. The site was excavated between 1901 and 1907 under the direction of vardapet Khachik Dadian, who uncovered the foundations of the cathedral as well as the remains of the Catholicos palace and a winery. The excavations furthermore revealed that Zvartnots stood on the remnants of structures that dated back to the reign of [Urartian king Rusa II.  Structure  Most scholars accept the 1905 reconstruction by Toros Toramanian, who worked on the original excavations and proposed that the building had three floors. The plan of the cathedral, as drawn by Toros Toramanian. Some scholars, like Stepan Mnatsakanian and most notably A. Kuznetsov, however, have rejected his reconstruction and offered alternative plans. Kuznetsov, for example, contended that Toramanian's plan was \\"illogical from the standpoint of construction\\" and insisted that the technical expertise at the time did not correspond to the bold design conceived by Toramanian. Kuznetsov, A. –¢–µ–∫—Ço–Ω–∏–∫a –∏ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—áec–∫–∏—Ö –ó–¥a–Ω–∏–π. Moscow, 1951, pp. 110-114. The interior of the mosaic-decorated church had the shape of a Greek cross or tetraconch, with an aisle encircling this area, while the exterior was a 32-sided polygon which appeared circular from a distance. Some sources claim that the Zvartnots cathedral is depicted upon Mount Ararat in a relief in Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. However, this is not very likely as the fresco was painted more than 300 years after the destruction of the church. Zvartnots was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2000 together with churches in Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). A drawing of the cathedral was depicted on the first release of 100 AMD banknotes and its model can be seen in Yerevan History Museum.  Influence  The church of St. Gregory (better known as Gagkashen) in Ani (now in Turkey) was built in 1001-1005 and was intended to be a recreation of Zvartnots. The Holy Trinity Church in the Malatia-Sebastia district of Yerevan is modeled by architect Baghdasar Arzoumanian after Zvartnots and was completed in 2003.

One of the inspirations of 60x365 was Boris Willis's Dance-A-Day project where Willis podcast a single dance every day for a year. Another inspiration (including the title) is 60x60, another miniature project in which Morneau's work was also part of several 60x60 mixes including the Crimson Mix, Order of Magnitude Mix, 2009 International Mix, 2008 International Mix, Evolution Mix (part II) 2007 International Mix, 2007 Midwest Mix, and 2006 Midwest Mix.

History  = Background = Similar to the Baptist Convention of Hong Kong and the Macau Baptist Convention, the CBC traces its origins from the original missionaries sent by the Triennial Convention to China. The Revd. John William Shuck and his wife, Henrietta Shuck, established their work in Portuguese ruled Macau in 1835 whereas Dr. and Mrs. William Dean began work at the same time among Chaozhou speaking Chinese in Bangkok, Thailand.Hong Kong American Baptist Mission: Our Story The work was relocated to Hong Kong in 1842 where both the Shucks and the Deans worked with the Cantonese and Chaozhou speaking Chinese respectively. They were joined by other missionaries, including Issachar Jacox Roberts, who began mission work in Canton (present day Guangzhou) in 1844, becoming one of the first Western missionary to work outside the relative safety of the protected European factories and the Deans relocated their mission headquarters to Swatow (present day Shantou) in 1860. By 1949, the American Southern Baptist Mission in China had 220 missionaries working in 392 congregations, 410 outreach points, serving a total of 123,000 Baptist Christians.ROC Department of Civil Affairs: Âè∞ÁÅ£Âú∞ÂçÄÂÆóÊïôÁ∞°‰ªã - Âü∫Áù£Êïô - Êµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉ (in Chinese) The bulk of the work was located in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Kiangsu, Honan, Ahnwei, and Shantung and it included institutions like hospitals, schools, and colleges in Pingtu, Longkow, Kweilin, Yangchow, K'aifeng, and a few other cities and towns.Lalulalu.com: ‰∏≠ËèØÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉËÅØÊúÉ (in Chinese) By 1951, most foreign missionaries were expelled from mainland China with the establishment of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. = Work in Taiwan = In October 1936, a resolution was passed during the centenary celebrations of the Baptist mission in China to engage in the extension of work to the frontier regions, which then included Taiwan which was a part of Japan. With the retrocession of Taiwan to China following the surrender of Japan in 1945, plans were made to expand the mission to Taiwan. A visit was made by a Shanghai missionary, Lila Florence Watson, in February 1948. In 1948, the National Baptist Convention of China was established in Shanghai and Yang Mei Chai (Ê•äÁæéÈΩã) was sent to Taiwan to establish a frontier mission in June of the same year. Yang was also appointed the head of the Taiwan district of the national convention. Bertha Smith of the American Southern Baptist Mission in Shantung arrived in Taiwan on October 19, 1948 and the first church was inaugurated on December 26 of the same year. = Local ministry = In the 1950s, the CBC saw an influx of missionaries and refugees from the mainland. This led to the rapid growth of the church particularly in the Mandarin language ministry with significant support from the Southern Baptist Convention in the United States. The first Taiwanese Hokkien service was conducted in at the Amoy Street Baptist Church (ÂªàÈñÄË°óÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉ). In February 1957, the first Taiwanese congregation was established as the Mu Yi Church (ÊÖïÁæ©Â†Ç). Work among the Hakkas began in 1958 in Miaoli and further work was planted in Pingtung. Work began with the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan as early as 1951 in Liouguei, Kaohsiung with the establishment of the Liouguei Baptist Church (ÂÖ≠ÈæúÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉ). Work in languages apart from Mandarin was however generally slow due to the lack of standard materials and work among the aboriginal people was not significant until the first Ami pastor graduated from the Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary in 1982.Chinese Baptist Convention: ÂæûÈÇäÁñÜÂà∞Á¶èÁàæÊë©Ê≤ô (in Chinese) = Later developments = From the period of 1948 to 1954, a total of 11 churches and 22 outreach points had been established by Baptist missionaries and workers. On July 5, 1954, the Taiwan Baptist Association (Âè∞ÁÅ£Êµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉËÅØ) was established. It was later renamed the Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Province Convention and the Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Convention before assuming its current name in 1972. Similar to Baptist churches elsewhere, churches affiliated with the CBC are autonomous and self-governed and the CBC doesn't exercise any executive authority. The CBC's role is primarily in the coordination of work among the associated churches and the management of inter-church institutions.  Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary  The seminary was established in 1952 for the training of national workers. Until recently the seminary had faced problems from the authorities as it was an unrecognized institution and had faced accusations of awarding fraudulent academic degrees in the past. In 2005, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution to provide for the framework of recognition of religious academic institutions and seminaries allowing the seminary to initiate the procedure of gaining full recognition from the authorities.Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary: Why would TBTS Apply for Registration  Affiliations  The CBC is a member of the Baptist World Alliance and the Asia Pacific Baptist Federation.
