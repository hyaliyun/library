Canned Laughter is a British one-off comedy television programme featuring Rowan Atkinson, broadcast on 8 April 1979 on ITV. Atkinson plays three roles; the nerdy Robert Box (who has been cited as an early incarnation of the Mr. Bean character, albeit involving more dialogue), his sinister boss Mr. Marshall, and would be stand-up comic Dave Perry, as well as an uncredited role as a radio announcer. Produced by LWT, the thirty minute episode was directed by Geoffrey Sax. Synopsis=Act 1= The episode begins with Robert Box sleeping. He rises by the tune of a disco tune playing on his radio alarm, and then shines by the radio station jingle (leading to a clich√©d advert for a deliberately unidentified product). He then heads to the mirror as he tries to figure out how to ask one woman colleague on a date. As the radio begins to play \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" by ELO, the scene turns to Dave Perry who announces to a neighbour that he has his first major gig at a \\"swish (posh) restaurant\\" in Camden Town. Said neighbour, Mrs. Nolan has been sued for divorce by her husband after 45 years of marriage. Still at home, Robert shaves in a rather awkward fashion. He then finds out he's late for work and eats a spoonful of instant coffee and one of sugar, and takes a sip of cream and one of water, and finally shakes himself up before leaving his flat. Meanwhile, Perry takes a bus to Sloane Square, where a sarcastic bus conductor proceeds to take a slice off a pound bill since Dave just had 15 pence instead of the 16p the conductor charged him, disbelieving the fact that Perry was in fact a comedian. The scene then turns again to Box, who is shown running to work, tripping with a \\"Help the Blind\\" sign in the process. At work, Mr. Marshall has refused the whole office a pay increase in light of most workers chain-smoking (A co-worker then hides a cigarette on one of Robert's pockets). After the meeting, Box summons up the courage to ask Lorraine (Sue Holderness) on the date. The act ends with Robert's coat getting on fire because of the cigarette, with \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" on the background. =Act 2= The act begins with the \\"Sarraceno\\" restaurant pianist playing \\"Smoke...\\". The scene quickly turns to Robert and Lorraine having a conversation about the place. Then they order dinner: Box asks for \\"soup and beef\\", Lorraine makes her order in French, much to Box's dismay, as he didn't understand a word. She explains that her father was stationed in Toulouse, but Robert asks her for him, not knowing that Lorraine's dad is dead. Then the entertainment is presented: Dave Perry. However, what he expected to be his \\"big break\\" turned out to be a series of quips, with Box being the only one laughing at his jokes, with Lorraine being increasingly annoyed. After Perry ended his routine unnoticed, Lorraine begins to tell Robert about her concern about diverse issues, such as the Third World and lemmings, among others. The waiter then goes to ask them for dinner. Box decides to dance so to get on Lorraine's good side, but unfortunately the dance floor is comically small. The dance turns to be a disaster, with him wreaking havoc by tossing and turning his date around the restaurant, causing her to leave early. Turns out also that Mr. Marshall was also having dinner at the place, deciding to sack Robert on the spot. Despondent, the lonely and now unemployed Box is joined by the equally downtrodden Dave, who hasn't had a good night either. As the credits roll, Lorraine passes by a shop where she sees Robert instead of John Travolta, making her turn away. On other works Atkinson reprised his Robert Box character in 1982 (now named \\"Bernard Fripp\\") for a theatrical comedy featurette called Dead on Time, which in turn reused the gag of the main character tripping over a \\"Help the Blind\\" sign. The Mr. Bean episode The Trouble with Mr. Bean (1991) partially reused the electric shaver gag (with Bean's nose hairs getting stuck on the shaver, whereas Robert shaved his whole face (except his eyebrows and tongue). Robert Box's \\"no coffee mug\\" routine later appeared in the 1992 series Funny Business, in which Atkinson played a silent comedy character called Kevin Bartholomew. The same gag would later be used again in Bean, the 1997 Mr. Bean feature film.

Recording For the recording of this song, guitarist Slash used a slightly different setup. For the rest of the album, he used a Gibson Les Paul copy through a modified Marshall amplifier on the same settings for each song. However, for this song, he swapped to a 1960s Gibson SG because he felt it had a darker sound.  Composition and lyrical intent  The song is about a friend of the band, a girl named Michelle Young who is thanked in the Appetite For Destruction cover sleeve. Slash knew Young throughout junior high, as she was a friend of Slash's first girlfriend.Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. pp. 119 According to Axl Rose, he and Young were in a car together when \\"Your Song\\" by Elton John came on the radio and Young 'happened' to mention that she had always wanted someone to write a song about her. Rose's first attempt was a sweet, almost romantic song, but one that had absolutely nothing to do with the reality of Michelle's life. He was unhappy with this version and re-wrote it, this time seeking to be completely honest.An Interview With The Gunners, Hit Parader - March 1988; retrieved January 3, 2008, from Several members of the band expressed concern over this version of the song, especially Slash, fearing it would upset Young.Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. pp. 120 Rose himself then became hesitant, but finally decided to show it to her. She liked the song and the attention it brought to her, and was especially pleased with its honesty, most notably regarding her drug addiction, the death of her mother and her father's work in the pornography industry, all of which are mentioned within the first verse. According to Slash's self-titled autobiography, Young managed to clean up and move across the country to escape her lifestyle.

SID was founded in 1962. Its main activities are publishing technical journals and running \\"Display Week\\", its main conference, held in May or June each year. SID publications include the Journal of the Society for Information Display, published monthly, the Digest of Technical Papers from SID's annual conference, Information Display magazine, proceedings from other conferences such as the Vehicle Displays and Interfaces Symposium, Asia Display, and International Display Workshops. In addition, local chapters in the Americas, Europe, and throughout Asia have meetings frequently, including lectures by display technologists, and are sometimes offered as webcasts. The SID Board of Directors grants several SID awards based upon outstanding achievements and significant contributions. History In early 1960s, IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers. Later IRE was merged with AIEE to form IEEE in January, 1963.) declined to create a new Section devoted solely to electronic information displays. This caused founders from IRE to start their own society, Society for Information Display (SID). SID was founded when Dr. Luxenberg held a meeting on September 29, 1962 at UCLA in Boelter Hall. There were 39 initial attendees. One of the founding members of SID was Edith M. Bairdain. The organization was made up of professionals interested in information display and the interactions between humans and machines. The annual SID symposium, seminar and exhibition is known as \\"Display Week.\\" Due to emergence of new display technologies and their successful commercialization, such as CRT, Plasma Display, LCD Display and OLED Displays, SID has expanded its scale in membership as well as the attendance in Display Week, its symposium and exhibition. In 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, SID Display Week was held for the first time online. The event drew more than 5,500 attendees from 50+ countries and Takatoshi Tsujimura was named SID president.

It is isomeric with 4-pyrone. 2-Pyrone is used in organic synthesis as a building block for more complex chemical structures because it may participate in a variety of cycloaddition reactions to form bicyclic lactones. For example, it readily undergoes Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes producing, upon loss of carbon dioxide, substituted benzenes. The Gogte Synthesis (1938) is a method for the alkylation of certain pyrones with acid chlorides. Derivatives The most common natural products containing a 2-pyrone are the bufanolides and kavalactones. Oxovitisin A, a pyranoanthocyanin found in wine, also contains a 2-pyrone element. 6-Amyl-Œ±- pyrone (6PP) is a derivative of 2-pyrone, found in animal foods and heated beef. Due to its good organoleptic properties with coconut aroma, it is used as flavor enhancer in the food industry. Biologically, it is produced by Trichoderma species via solid state fermentation. Derivatives of 2-pyrone play a role as signalling molecules in bacterial communication, similar to quorum sensing. Cells with LuxR-type receptors, but lacking its homolog LuxI (and thus unable to produce N-acylhomoserine lactone QS signaling molecules) are known as LuxR \\"solos\\", to which pyrones bind as ligands facilitating cell-cell communication.

There were also many raids on apartments, robberies and arsons. According to the Human Rights Watch reporter Robert Kushen, \\"the action was not entirely (or perhaps not at all) spontaneous, as the attackers had lists of Armenians and their addresses\\".Conflict in the Soviet Union: Black January in Azerbaidzhan, by Robert Kushen, 1991, Human Rights Watch, , p. 7 The pogrom of Armenians in Baku was one of the acts of ethnic violence in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, directed against the demands of the Nagorno- Karabakh Armenians to secede from Azerbaijan and unify with Armenia.

London: Minority Rights Group, 1991 In 1988 the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave incorporated into the Soviet Azerbaijan, started voicing their demands for the unification of the enclave with Armenia. On February 20, 1988 the Soviet of People's Deputies in Karabakh voted to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This process took place in the light of the new economic and political policies, Perestroika and Glasnost, introduced by the new General Secretary of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev who had come to power on March 10, 1985.Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war Thomas De Waal This unprecedented action by a regional soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians' demands labelling them as ‚Äúnationalists‚Äù and ‚Äúextremists‚Äù. On the following day demonstrations were held by Azerbaijanis in Baku and other cities of Azerbaijan against the unification of Karabakh with Armenia, during which strong anti-Armenian sentiments were voiced, the common slogans were: 'Death to Armenians', 'Armenians out of Azerbaijan'. On February 27, 1988 a massive pogrom was carried out in Sumgait during which the Armenian population of the city was brutally slaughtered and expelled.Shahmuratian Samvel (ed.)

Nationalism and Ethnic Politics, vol. 1 (1), Spring 1995, pp. 86‚Äì110 The pogrom By January 1990, Azerbaijan was in turmoil. Large rallies by the Azerbaijani Popular Front took place in Baku. On January 12 a mass rally took place in the city's Lenin Square, during which the radical nationalists of Azerbaijan's anti-communist Popular Front were calling people for the defense of Azerbaijan's sovereignty from the demands of the Armenians. At the same time groups of young Azerbaijanis were roaming the streets, terrorizing Armenian citizens and warning them to leave the town. > The rhetoric of some Popular Front leaders, which included calls for the > deportation of Armenians from Azerbaijan, was at least harmful to the > relations with the Armenian population; that rhetoric was not significantly > toned down during the pogroms.Conflict in the Soviet Union: Black January in > Azerbaijan, by Robert Kushen, 1991, Human Rights Watch, , p. 8 Thomas de Waal has called this pogrom the first part of \\"Black January\\" a tragedy with about 90 Armenian victims. According to him, at first a large crowd gathered in the Lenin Square of Baku, and at nightfall different groups separated from the Azerbaijani Popular Front demonstrators, and started to attack Armenians. As in Sumgait, their activities were distinguished by extreme cruelty: the area around the Armenian quarter became an arena of mass killings. During the \\"pogroms in Baku, Armenian homes were set on fire and looted while many Armenians were killed or injured\\". Kirill Stolyarov in his book \\"Break-up\\" describes beatings of the elderly, expelling them from their homes, burning people alive and other cases of savagery.Kirill Stolyarov \\"Break-up.

Aleksei Vasiliev, an Azerbaijani soldier of the Soviet army testified seeing a naked woman being thrown out of the window into the fire in which her furniture was burning. The events in Baku were reflected in a report by the Armenian state party in the UN Committee in elimination of discrimination against women, July 27, 1997: > For five days in January of 1990, the Armenian community of Baku, the > capital of Azerbaijan, were killed, tortured, robbed and humiliated. > Pregnant women and babies were molested, little girls were raped in front of > their parents' eyes, Christian crosses were burned on their backs, and they > were abused for their Christian faith.Committee on the elimination of > discrimination against women Bill Keller, who was in Baku after the events, in his report for The New York Times wrote: > Here and there, boarded windows or soot-blackened walls mark an apartment > where Armenians were driven out by mobs and their belongings set afire on > the balcony.

Thus the pogrom in Baku resulted in numerous human casualties; dozens of thousands of Armenians lost their houses and were deported from the country ‚Äì this was acknowledged by the Chairman of the Soviet of the Union Yevgeny Primakov on the closed session of the Supreme Council of USSR on March 5, 1990. The victims of the pogrom were not only Armenians but also \\"the Jews, Ossetians, Georgians, and all others who resembled Armenians to a greater or lesser extent. They were beating in the face, not in the passport.\\" The pogrom lasted for about seven days during which Central authorities did little to stop the violence ‚Äì no state of emergency was declared in Baku. The police did not respond to the calls of the victims.Cullen, Robert, \\"A Reporter at Large: Roots\\", The New Yorker, April 15, 1991. Der Nesessian, The Armenians, (London), 1969, p. 70. Several eyewitnesses told Helsinki Watch/Memorial that they \\"approached militiamen(police) on the street to report nearby attacks on Armenians, but the militiamen did nothing\\". Many testimonies confirm that the police deliberately did nothing to put an end to the pogrom and that everything was organised in advance as the pogrom makers knew exactly where the Armenian lived. Azaddin Gyulmamedov, a young Azerbaijani who attended the rally in Baku on the 13th and witnessed the outbreak of anti-Armenian violence, gave the following testimony: > We went to see what was happening. We saw these guys in the streets. I don't > know who they were -drug addicts, maybe. They had sticks and clubs, and > lists of Armenians and where they lived.

(translation: The authorities of the Azerbaijan SSR, and the respective bodies in particular, could not but have known that in the specially organized demonstration a provocation was planned in advance ‚Äì as if the Armenians were killing the Azerbaijanis. And the five thousand protesters at once spread all over the city having in their hands the addresses of Armenian apartments. It was hard to take measures in this situation, especially taking into account that the actions of internal troops were being blocked as the bandits were hiding behind the women and children using them as live shields. What lessons did the Azerbaijani authorities learn from this? None!) The authorities thus not only failed to stem the anti- Armenian attacks, but also raised serious doubts about whether the Soviets wished to stem the violence at all or merely to hold the power in Baku.

History  The early castle, whose construction date is unknown, is mentioned in a 1052 charter. During the 13th century, it was restored by Odon IV of Ham who gave the fortress its definitive shape, a polygonal enceinte broken up by large cylindrical towers. Enguerrand de Coucy bought the seigneury in 1380 and his daughter sold it in 1400 to Louis d' Orl√©ans, who integrated it into his network of fortresses which included La Fert√©-Milon, Pierrefonds and F√®re-en- Tardenois. Louis began the reconstruction, perfected after 1418 by John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny, who acquired the seigneury following Louis' assassination. John's nephew, Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol and constable to Louis XI in 1465, constructed a monumental keep in 1441. This massive tower (the tour du conn√©table - constable's tower) was 33 m (~108 ft) in diameter and 33 m (~108 ft) high and had walls 11 m (~36 ft) thick. The Ch√¢teau de Ham was besieged several times, notably by Philip II of Spain in 1557. United with the French crown under the reign of Henri IV, it was transformed at the end of the 17th century by Vauban. The castle was later turned into a state prison. It 'welcomed' many famous prisoners, the last of whom was Prince Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (the future Napol√©on III) who, after six years, escaped by adopting the identity of a painter, Badinguet. Later, his opponents would often refer to him disparagingly as Badinguet In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the Second Army of the North encircled the town of Ham and forced the occupying Prussians to sign a surrender. Like the Ch√¢teau de Coucy, the fort was dynamited on 19 March 1917, by the Germans. All that remains today is the square plan entrance tower and parts of its network of enceintes. Ruines du ch√¢teau These picturesque ruins dominate the peaceful course of the Canal de la Somme. The castle has been listed since 1965 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

She was the first tenured female professor of Rutgers College. Early life and education Koller was born Noemie Benczer in Vienna, Austria on born August 21, 1933. Her father was a Ph.D. chemist and her mother worked as a bookbinder. The family moved frequently in her early childhood due to the turbulence of World War II. Her family moved from Vienna to Paris, and then subsequently moved further south in France several times to escape the German invasion. They subsequently emigrated to Cuba, and then to Mexico where she attended the Lyc√©e Franco- Mexicain beginning in 1943. Upon completing high school at the Lyc√©e in 1951, she traveled to New York to receive a college education. She was accepted into Barnard College, the women's college associated with Columbia University, which did not accept female applicants at the time. She entered Barnard with standing as a junior, as she received credit for the humanities courses at the Lyc√©e, and was able to attain a B.A. in Physics in two years. She entered graduate studies at Columbia University in 1953; she received her M.S. in 1955 and earned her Ph.D. in 1958 in experimental physics. She continued at Columbia as a postdoctoral research associate until 1960. During her time at Barnard and Columbia, Koller worked as a laboratory assistant to Chien-Shiung Wu, an experimental physicist whose work focused on beta decay. Wu became a mentor and friend. Upon Wu's death, Koller spoke about her at the meeting of the American Physical Society; Koller later wrote a brief biography of Dr. Wu for the National Academy of Sciences. She has written that Wu was an \\"extremely careful experimentalist,\\" and credits Wu with giving her a hands-on education with experimental technique.  Career  In the fall of 1960, Koller was hired at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. She was the first woman hired in the Physics department; in 1965, she became the first tenured female professor of Rutgers College. At Rutgers she has been a major member of the nuclear physics research group working on the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator, as well as a condensed-matter physicist, performing experiments using the M√∂ssbauer effect, by which she investigated the electronic structure of magnetic materials. According to the 'Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics' (CWP) Project of the UCLA entry on Koller, Koller was a pioneer in several areas of nuclear and condensed matter physics, including the first identification of the double gamma decay of the observationally stable but theoretically unstable 40Ca isotope to the ground state: a 0+ ‚Üí 0+ transition; the observation of the interplay of single particle and collective motions in nuclei; and the description of a broad range of nuclear electromagnetic transitions in the rare earth region using a simple relation based on constant gyromagnetic ratios for nucleon pairs. Accordering to the Encyclopedia of World Scientists, she was the first person to directly measure the \\"magnetic moments of super-deformed nuclear states\\" and developed techniques \\"to study magnetic properties of nuclei far from the valley of stability.\\" Koller was active in administrative duties also.

The Town Center is located on the site of the original Coliseum Mall, an enclosed facility constructed in 1973 by Mall Properties Inc. of New York, its only owner. At 991,000-square feet (876,000 retail, 115,000 office), Peninsula Town Center is the largest redevelopment project in Hampton's history. Mall Properties has teamed with Steiner + Associates, which developed Easton Town Center in Columbus; Zona Rosa in Kansas City; The Greene Town Center near Dayton; and Bayshore Town Center near Milwaukee to create Peninsula Town Center. Peninsula Town Center has a mix of department and specialty retailers and restaurants, as well as commercial office and residential space above stores on some buildings. There are also several landscaped parks, plazas and squares and 4,402 parking spaces in surface and structured lots as well as on-street. History Coliseum Mall was built in 1973, as a commercial centerpiece of Hampton's Mercury Boulevard-Coliseum Central district and still remains the largest single tax source within the city. Coliseum opened with three anchors: E. J. Korvette, JCPenney, and Nachman's. The center was the largest and busiest shopping area on the Virginia Peninsula as it opened on October 31, 1973, until Newmarket North Mall opened in 1975 with Sears, Leggett, and Miller & Rhoads which had moved from its original location across the street at the original Newmarket Shopping Center. The Coliseum Mall was expanded in 1976, adding Norfolk-based Smith & Welton and Richmond-based Thalhimers. The Smith & Welton location was later a Children's Palace toy store. In 1980 E. J. Korvette declared bankruptcy and closed all its locations. The Coliseum location was left vacant until major tenant Montgomery Ward acquired the space. Ward had moved from the adjacent Mercury Plaza Mall which was converted into an open-air shopping center. The company's Auto Center remained at Mercury. In 1987, Crown American and the City of Newport News built and developed the competitive Patrick Henry Mall, and later surrounding \\"big-box\\" shopping centers sprouted around the mall during the 1990s. Since then the city's Oyster Point/Patrick Henry district has experienced substantial growth, making commercial retail challenging for the Coliseum Central district of Hampton. Until the last several years, Coliseum existed, though did not really keep up with changing times. The Nachman's became Hess's, then Proffitt's, then Dillard's, which also opened an auxiliary store in the former Children's Palace. Thalhimers became Hecht's in 1991 and Macy's in 2006. Both of the Dillard's stores closed in 2003. The same year, a portion of the mall was set aside to accommodate a Burlington Coat Factory store. Burlington Coat Factory instead opened in the former Montgomery Ward building, and a short-lived Steve & Barry's opened in the slot originally slated for Burlington Coat Factory.  Redevelopment  On January 14, 2007, Coliseum Mall permanently closed its doors to prepare for demolition in late February 2007. The mall was redeveloped as an open-air center, anchored by the existing Macy's and JCPenney, along with a new Target store. On January 7, 2016; Macy's announced three Hampton Roads locations, including the one at Peninsula Town Center, would close as part of a series of 40 locations being closed in early 2016.

He was known as a leading Hebraist and Bible translator.  Life  He was born at Ferrara and educated at the University of Padua. He was converted about 1540 to the Catholic faith through Cardinal Pole but embraced Protestantism in the following year, before going to Strasbourg to teach Hebrew. Owing to the Schmalkaldic War in Germany, he was compelled to seek asylum in England, where he resided at Lambeth Palace with Archbishop Cranmer in 1547. Two years later, he succeeded Paul Fagius as Regius professor of Hebrew at Cambridge. On the death of Edward VI of England he returned to Germany in 1553. At Zweibr√ºcken he was imprisoned as a Calvinist.Nicholas Barker, 'The Perils of Publishing in the Sixteenth Century: Pietro Bizari and William Parry, Two Elizabethan Misfits', in Edward Chaney and Peter Mack (editors), England and the Continental Renaissance: Essays in Honour of J. B. Trapp (1990), pp. 125-6. He became professor of Old Testament at the University of Heidelberg in 1561 and remained there until he was released from his post in 1577. He ultimately found refuge at the College of Sedan, where he died. According to Morison, he \\"when dying reversed his nation's decision, and exclaimed, Not Barabbas, but Jesus! (Vivat Christus, et pereat Barabbas!).\\"James Morison, A Practical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Matthew, (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1902), p. 581. Works His chief literary work was a Latin translation of the Bible from the Hebrew and Syriac. The New Testament translation, by Theodore Beza, appeared in 1569, at Geneva. The five parts relating to the Old Testament were published at Frankfurt between 1575 and 1579, in London in 1580, and in numerous later editions. The work was joint with Franciscus Junius (the elder), his son-in-law. Harris Fletcher remarks that there were two quite different versions of Tremellius available in the late 1500s: > The Junius-Tremellius Bible first appeared from 1575-79, and subsequently in > two different major forms. One of these in 1585 was printed as a tall folio > with copious marginal notes, which were for the greater part written by > Tremellius. The folio editions contained, in addition to Tremellius' Latin > Old Testament with this large amount of marginal notation, a complete Latin > translation of the Apochrypha done by Junius, and two Latin translations of > the New Testament, one being of the fragmentary Syriac version by > Tremellius, and the other from the Greek by Beza. The other form in which > this Bible appeared was printed, usually in quarto, without notes, with the > Apochrypha, and after 1585 with only Beza's translation of the New > Testament. The Tremellius translation was favored by John Milton, \\"undoubtedly\\" the folio version, with Tremellius's marginal notes, according to Harris. It was used also by John Donne for his version of Lamentations. Archbishop James Ussher also used the Junius-Tremellius translation when compiling his Annals of the World.James Ussher, Larry and Marion Pierce (editors), The Annals of the World, Revised and Updated from the 1658 English Translation, Master Books, Green Forest, AR (2003), p. 6 Tremellius also translated John Calvin's Geneva Catechism into Hebrew (Paris, 1551), and wrote a \\"Chaldaic\\" and Syriac grammar (Paris, 1569).

Hafjell hosted the alpine skiing technical events (giant slalom and slalom) at the 1994 Winter Olympics; the speed events were held at Kvitfjell, a regular stop on the World Cup tour for men's speed events in March. Hafjell occasionally hosts World Cup slalom and giant slalom races, last in 2006 (women) and 1996 (men's and women's finals).fis-ski.com - World Cup - Hafjell podiums Hafjell Bike Park Hafjell Bike Park is renowned as the best Bike Park for downhill riding in Norway and some of the bike trails have a vertical drop of 830 m, varies in difficulty with jumps and drops for the ‚Äùnut balls‚Äù and easier lines for the beginners. Since its early inception in 2001, Hafjell Bike Park has exploded into a world class Bike Park. It started with the ‚ÄúWednesday Club‚Äù, a group of local riders doing shuttle runs in the area that soon became tired of blasting down the Hafjell fire-roads and craved more demanding trails. In Feb, 2002 a meeting between Snorre Pedersen and the manager of Hafjell Alpine Centre, Geir Olsen occurred, resulting in support from Hafjell Alpine Centre, ending the Illegal trail building. Snorre Pedersen is the architect of the Park, and is described as a magician with bike trails, and back in 2003 he started as a pioneer, digging and constructing the NC-trail, together with the help of volunteers putting in hundreds of hours of manual labour. Hafjell did on this trail later host a National Downhill race in 2004. This was the start of the designing and transforming of the hills of Hafjell, and this turned it into a true paradise for the downhill enthusiasts. Altogether 14 trails are now carved into the alpine wooden landscape. Whether you prefer downhill, cross-country or trail riding, Hafjell can make your biking better through its gondola and lift accessed mountain biking experience. The name Until 1930 the name was written \\"Avfjellet\\" on maps. The first element is av 'off', the last element is fjell n 'mountain'. The meaning is 'the mountain broken off a larger mountain' (the top of Hafjell lies beneath the larger and taller mountain Nevelfjell, and it could be considered to be a part of this). The first element was pronounced just as [a:], and the h was later added (see h-adding) to emphasize it. Events The venue hosted the Alpine skiing events during the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.

He played for Western Province in the Currie Cup and for the Stormers in the Super 14 until a neck injury forced him into retirement in January 2007. Greeff also played 12 Tests for . Greeff was a talented utility back, but his career was blighted by a succession of injuries: a broken hand, damaged shoulder, injured knee, and, finally, a career-ending neck injury. He made his international debut in June 2002, when he came on as a substitute against , and went on to win a further 11 caps, all but one as a starter. The only time he did not start as a fullback was in his last international appearance, against Georgia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, when he played centre. Although Werner Greeff scored only four tries for his country, one of them, against in a Tri Nations match at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, on 17 August 2002, was voted the South African try of that year. The Springboks, who had gone behind 0-9 after conceding three kickable penalties in the first 20 minutes, scored four tries to take a 26-9 lead with 20 minutes remaining. Australia responded with three tries and a drop-goal and led 26-31 as time expired on the clock. The Springboks played the last ten minutes with only 14 men after Marius Joubert had been shown a red card. Just before full-time they launched a last, desperate counter-attack which concluded with Werner Greeff hitting the Australian defence at full speed on a perfect angle and powering his way over the line for a try that levelled the scores; with the last kick of the match, he then converted his own try to give South Africa a dramatic win. In March 2006, Greeff underwent neck surgery that involved the fusion of two vertebrae. After spending six months in rehabilitation, he returned to play one game for Stellenbosch University second XV (the Victorians) against the University of Cape Town in September 2006 and scored a try within the first 20 seconds. He made his return to first-class rugby as a starter in Western Province's home game against Griquas in the 2006 Currie Cup, and started again a week later, when WP lost in the semi-final to the Blue Bulls. He was named in the Stormers' squad for the 2007 Super 14, but, after playing in a pre-season warm-up game against a Boland team, continuing concerns about the neck injury forced him to announce his retirement from rugby on 22 January 2007. Already the owner of a fast-food outlet in Cape Town, he indicated that it was his intention to pursue his business interests.

Alheit arrived in South Africa in 1842 and worked at mission stations in Tulbagh (1842-7), Schietfontein (1847‚Äì64), Stellenbosch (1864‚Äì73) and Saron (1873-1882). Between 1864 and 1873 he was head of a boys' hostel in Stellenbosch where a third of the boys were the sons of Rhenish missionaries. Here Alheit showed great aptitude in the teaching of mathematics. Another hostel opened in 1860 and was called the Rhenish Institute for the daughters of Rhenish missionaries. From these schools a Gymnasium developed, which later turned into Victoria College and finally into Stellenbosch University. The hamlet of Alheit on the Orange River between Kakamas and the Augrabies Falls, is named after him.

History  CAS development began with an attempt to offer an alternative to the IQ test (Das, Kirby & Jarman, 1975,Das, J. P., Kirby, J. R., & Jarman R. F. (1975). Simultaneous and successive syntheses: An alternative model for cognitive abilities. Psychological Bulletin, 82, 87‚Äì103. 1979Das, J. P., Kirby, J. R., & Jarman, R. F. (1979). Simultaneous and successive cognitive processes. New York: Academic Press.). Developed and published in 1997 by J.P. Das, PhD of the University of Alberta and Jack Naglieri, PhD, then at Ohio State University, the CAS has its theoretical bases both in the neuropsychology of Luria as well as in cognitive psychology. CAS is based on the planning, attention-arousal, simultaneous and successive (PASS) cognitive processing theory (or the PASS Theory of Intelligence), a modern theory within the information-processing framework (Das, Naglieri & Kirby, 1994Das, J. P., Naglieri, J. A., & Kirby, J. R. (1994). Assessment of cognitive processes. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.). Roots of CAS are in Luria's (1973)Luria, A. R. (1973). The working brain: An introduction to neuropsychology. New York. organization of cognitive functions in the brain as well as in cognitive psychology of Baddeley, Estes, Posner and other contemporary psychologists. Their work has guided the selection and interpretation of CAS tests. The Kaufman assessment battery for children or KABC by (Alan S. Kaufman, 1983Kaufman, A.S., & Kaufman, N.L. (1983). Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. Circle Pines, MN: American Guidance Service. ) is perhaps the first battery of commercially available tests to provide a psychometric assessment of cognitive processes. K-ABC has used several references to the early research of Das and his colleagues (Das, Kirby & Jarman, 1979) on simultaneous and successive processing, a precursor to PASS theory. KABC did not assess the Arousal-Attention, and Planning functions, as CAS did, until K-ABC II appeared in 2004. The latter provides two theoretical bases, one of them in Luria (1966)Luria, A. R. (1966). Higher cortical functions in man.

(2005). The Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Cognitive Abilities. D. Flanagan & P. L. Harrison (Editors). Contemporary Intellectual Assessment New York: The Guilford Press. Pp136-182.). Some may consider this a strength of KABC-II. However, two important features of CAS have set it apart from ability measures within fluid and crystallized abilities of CHC, and verbal-performance IQ: * CAS is a system of assessment of ‚Äòprocesses‚Äô, not abilities. Ability tests such as WISC/WAIS * those that measure fluid and crystallized abilities address different constructs than process assessments. CAS process measures may have the same contents in several of its sub-tests (i.e. verbal, as in Simultaneous Verbal, and Word-series, see next section) but the codes are different (Simultaneous contrasted with Successive. see McCrea 2009McCrea, S.M.(2009). A cognitive neuropsychological examination of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System Subtests: A report of three stroke cases studied longitudinally during recovery. International Journal of Neuroscience,119,553‚Äì599. for further discussion).  The CAS battery  Cognitive process subtests in the CAS battery The CAS standard battery consists of three subtests for each PASS Scale (12 subtests in all) whereas the basic battery has 2 subtests for each scale (8 in total). It takes an hour to administer the standard battery and 40 minutes for the basic battery (Naglieri & Das, 1997Naglieri, J. A., & Das, J. P. (1997). Cognitive Assessment System. Administration and scoring manual. Interpretive handbook. Itasca, IL: Riverside.). The CAS battery provides a standard score for each process as well as a Full Scale standard score. The average internal reliability coefficients across ages 15‚Äì17 for the PASS scales are: * Planning = .88 * Attention = .88 * Simultaneous = .93 * Successive = .93 * Full Scale = .96. Each of these scales are described in detail below. For further explanation, see Naglieri, 1999 (B),Naglieri, J. A. (1999 B). How valid is the PASS theory and CAS? School Psychology Review, 28, 145‚Äì162. Naglieri & Das (2005).Naglieri, J. A., (2005). The Cognitive Assessment System. In D. P. Flanagan and P. L. Harrison (Eds.) Contemporary Intellectual Assessment (Second Edition) (pp. 441‚Äì460). New York: Guilford. Additional details on the origin of each of the 12 tests in CAS have been discussed at some length in Das, Naglieri &Kirby; (1994) and more recently in a review by McCrea (2009). = Planning Scale = Planning helps us select or develop strategies needed to complete tasks for which a solution is needed, and is critical to all activities where an individual has to determine how to solve a problem The Planning scale includes matching numbers, planned codes, and planned connections. In the matching numbers subtest, children are presented with four pages containing eight rows of numbers. The child is instructed to underline the two numbers that are the same. The planned codes subtest contains two pages, each with a distinct set of codes arranged in seven rows and eight columns. At the top of each page is a legend that indicates how letters relate to simple codes (e.g., A = OX; B = XX; C = OO). In the planned connections (a variation of Trails test) subtest the child is instructed to connect numbers in sequence that appear in a quasi-random order (e.g., 1‚Äì2‚Äì3, etc.). For these two tests, the child connects numbers and letters in sequential order, alternating between numbers and letters (e.g., 1-A-2-B, etc.). All Planning subtests include strategy assessment. This is conducted after the administration of each subtest and recorded in two categories: *Observed strategies ‚Äì those seen by the examiner * Reported strategies ‚Äì those obtained following completion of an item (Naglieri, 1999 ANaglieri, J. A. (1999 A). Essentials of CAS assessment. New York: Wiley.). = Attention Scale = Attention is a mental process that involves focusing on selected aspects of external events, internal events, or stimuli. Attention is controlled by intentions and goals. The Attention scale includes the expressive attention, number detection, and receptive attention subtests. Expressive attention (a variation of the Stroop test) has two forms, one for children 7 years and younger, and the other 8 & over. The receptive attention subtest contains two separate tasks; in the first task, targets are letters that are physically the same (e.g., BB but not Bb). For the second task, targets are letters that have the same name (e.g., Bb but not Ab). This subtest is an adaptation of Posner & Boise (1971).Posner, M.I.& Boise, S.J. (1971) Components of attention. Psychological Review,78,391‚Äì408. = Simultaneous Scale = Simultaneous processing is essential for organization of information into groups or a coherent whole. It requires both nonverbal and verbal processing for the analyses and synthesis of logical and grammatical components of language and comprehension of word relationships. The Simultaneous scale has nonverbal matrices, verbal spatial relations, and figure memory. Nonverbal matrices items present a variety of shapes; it is similar to Progressive Matrices. Verbal spatial relations subtest measures the comprehension of logical and grammatical descriptions of spatial relationships. In this subtest, the child is presented with six drawings, arranged in a specific spatial manner, and a printed question (e.g., show me the triangle to the left of the circle). The child is instructed to choose one of the six drawings that best answers the question. In Figure memory, a combination of Figure-Copying and Memory for Designs, the child is presented a two- or three-dimensional geometric figure for 5 seconds and then presented immediately with a response page, on which the original geometric figure is embedded in a larger, more complex geometric pattern. The child is asked to identify the original design. = Successive Scale = Successive processing is involved whenever information must be remembered or completed in a specific order or sequence. The Successive scale has word series, sentence repetition, and sentence questions. In word series, the examiner reads the child a series of words and then asks to repeat the words in the same order. Sentence repetition requires the child to read 20 sentences aloud one by one. After each sentence is read, the child is asked to repeat the sentence exactly as presented. The sentence questions subtest uses the same type of sentences that are used in the sentence repetition subtest. However, now the child is read a sentence and asked a question about it. For example, the examiner reads \\"The blue yellows the green\\" and asks the child \\"Who yellows the green?\\" In a modified form, it has been used as a test of working memory. Speech Rate (Ages 5 to 7) is an 8-item timed subtest that requires the child to repeat a string of 3 common words, such as dog-girl- book, over and over again as fast as possible until asked to stop. The score is the time it takes the child to complete 10 repetitions before stopping.  Present Use  CAS is used for understanding cognitive development of typical and atypical children, as well as cognitive impairment in adults. It has been used for research, diagnosis, and clinical evaluation by several professionals including educational and school psychologists because it provides good guidelines for educational interventions. Research on the relationship between the CAS and achievement has shown that the PASS processes strongly predict academic achievement in spite of the fact that it does not include vocabulary (Naglieri and Rojahn, 2004Naglieri, J. A., & Rojahn, J. R. (2004). Validity of the PASS Theory and CAS: Correlations with Achievement. Journal of Educational Psychology, 96, 174‚Äì181.). Similarly, CAS tests have been used for understanding, assessment of and intervention with educational problems associated with reading disabilities (Das, 2009Das, J.P. (2009). Reading difficulties and Dyslexia:An interpretation for teachers. New Delhi:SAGE International Publishers. ) such as autism, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Naglieri, 2005). CAS tests have also been used for clinical evaluation of mental retardation and cognitive changes in ageing (Das, 2003Das, J.P. (2003). Cognitive Aging and Down Syndrome: An Interpretation .International Review of Research in mental retardation. Volume 26, Pp 261‚Äì306.). Deserving of special mention is the use of CAS tests for fair assessment of minorities (Naglieri, 2005) and First Nation children whose chronic weakness in reading has been identified as a successive processing deficit compounded by poor home literacy (Das, Janzen & Georgiou, 2007Das JP, Janzen T, Georgiou GK. (2007). Correlates of Canadian Native Children's Reading Performance: From Cognitive Styles to Cognitive Processes. Journal of School Psychology 45(6):589‚Äì602.) both of which can be improved through PASS- related intervention (Hayward, Das & Janzen, 2007Hayward D, Das JP, Janzen T. (2007). Innovative programs for improvement in reading through cognitive enhancement: a remediation study of Canadian First Nations children. Journal of Learning Disabilities 40(5):443‚Äì57.). Additionally, CAS with supplementary tests has been found useful for research related to executive decision making in management (Das, Kar, & Parrila, 1996Das, J.P., Kar, B. & Parrila, R. (1996). Cognitive Planning:The psychological basis of intelligent behaviour. New Delhi:SAGE International Publishers.). CAS withstands adaptation and translation into other languages. CAS in Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Castillian), Norwegian and Swedish are commercially available. In addition, CAS has been used in Chinese, Greek, Norwegian and Dutch research.  Criticisms  The CAS meets at least two challenges, first in terms of its factor-analytic purity (Naglieri & Das, 1997 Interpretive handbook), and second in extending its scope by supplementary tests, especially for assessment of Executive Functions. The validity of CAS comprising the 4 PASS constructs is adequately supported by several books and studies (Das, Naglieri, & Kirby, 1994; Das, Kar & Parilla, 1996; Das, 2009). The CAS Interpretive Handbook, (Naglieri and Das, 1997) reported information about the factor structure of the CAS providing evidence that the PASS four-factor solution was the best solution based on the convergence of factor-analytic results, clinical utility of the four separate scores, evidence of strategy use and theoretical interpretation of the subtests. Keith and Kranzler (1999Keith, T. Z., & Kranzler, J. H. (1999). Independent confirmatory factor analysis of the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS): What does the CAS measure? School Psychology Review, 28, 117‚Äì144.) challenged this position and argued that there was insufficient support. Naglieri (1999 B) and Puhan, Das & Naglieri (2005)Puhan, G., Das, J.P.& Naglieri, J.A. (2005). Separating planning and attention: evidential and consequential validity. Canadian Journal of School Psychology, 20, 75‚Äì84. responded with reasonable evidence and rational arguments in defense of the structure of the test and the validity of the 4-factor CAS. However, the issue has not yet been resolved as yet. Additionally, the importance of using factor-analysis in support of theories of intelligence has not been supported by major contemporary theories of intelligence such as those advanced by Gardner, Robert Sternberg, Das (2004)Das, J.P. (2004). Theories of intelligence: issues and applications. In Hersen, M. (Eds.), Comprehensive Handbook of Psychological Assessment Volume 1 (pp. 5‚Äì21). New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons or even by Jensen (2006)Jensen, A.R. (2006). Clocking the mind. Oxford:Elsevier. in his chronometric approach to general intelligence, Clocking the Mind. An insistence on factor analytic confirmation may even be a hindrance to the desirable goal of closing the gap between psychology and the business of intelligence test development. The challenge for CAS is to extend itself into new areas of cognitive importance such as Executive Functions, and evaluation of neuropsychological impairments in an aging population. Curiously enough, few if any of the existing assessment instruments for these areas have emphasized the necessity of factor analysis. Insofar as constructive criticism goes, supplementary tests are necessary for extending the application of CAS. To begin with existing tests, the Successive subtests should have a nonverbal measure, such as Luria's test that asks participants to continue a series \\"+++__ __+++__ __+++__ __......\\", or a motor response of tapping to dot sequences such as \\"... .. ... .. ... ... .. \\" as given in Das, Kirby & Jarman (1979). Similarly, Attention subtests should include both a continuous performance test, and a more cognitively loaded vigilance test (Das, Naglieri & Kirby, 1994). In regard to Executive Functions, one would notice that elements of it are already included in CAS : Expressive attention (Stroop) = inhibition of response; Planned Connection (Trails) = shifting. But the existing Planning scale must be supplemented by tests of complex planning (Das, Kar & Parrila, 1996), and so-called ‚Äòhot‚Äô tests that involve affective decision making, such as the predicament test (Channon, 2004).Channon, S. (2004). Frontal lobe dysfunction and everyday problem-solving: Social and non-social contributions Acta Psychologica,115: 235‚Äì254 In conclusion, the CAS will increase its reach as a system for assessment of intelligence in keeping up with advances in psychological and neurological foundations of cognitive functions. Thus it may follow Cronbach's (1975)Cronbach, L. J. (1975). Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology.

Racers attempt to complete the stage in the shortest time. A race on a special stage is coordinated such that each competing racer begins after a set interval, to reduce the chance of impedance by other competitors. Each special stage is a relatively short section, usually up to about 30 miles in length. A rally usually comprises approximately 15-30 special stages. The driver with the lowest overall time for all special stages in an event is the winner. Special stage A special stage at the 2017 Rally Australia. The roads on which special stages are held vary from rally to rally, from the asphalt mountain passes used on the Monte Carlo Rally to the rough forest tracks used on the Rally GB. Surfaces such as ice and snow or desert sand are also common, with the aim of providing a challenge for the driver and crew as well as a test of the car's performance and reliability. While competing on a special stage, the drivers and co-drivers can have no support from their teams (except through radio/phone contact) and must deal with any breakdowns or problems themselves. Typically, each car will be given a specific start time for a stage at four-minute intervals. In the minutes before setting off, a car will wait stationary at the start point until the driver scheduled start time. The driver may begin immediately at that time, and usually an official (using hand signals) and the co-driver (through speech) will provide a ten-second countdown. The timing of a stage for a particular car starts at its scheduled time, not when it passes the start point. At the end of the stage, there are two sets of markers. The first is usually referred to as the flying finish, and is the point at which timing for the stage ends. The name comes from the fact that a car will be traveling at full racing speeds when it passes this post. Several hundred meters further along the stage is the stop control point, where the car must come to a halt in order for officials to record their time and check paperwork. Approximately 50 meters after the stop point is the end of the special stage restrictions. The cars must travel between special stages on public roads, often known as transport stages. While on public roads, all local traffic laws must be obeyed, so all cars must be roadworthy and taxed and insured. Drivers may be given a scheduled time to arrive at their destination to ensure they do not speed during the journey, with penalties for arriving too soon or too late (although the margin for late arrival is quite large).

History Humberside was established in 1892 as \\"Toronto Junction High School\\" in the basement of the local Presbyterian church. It moved to the current site in 1894 in the High Park area of Toronto, with the construction of a new Richardsonian Romanesque building. In 1903, the school was renamed \\"Toronto Junction Collegiate Institute\\", after a local street that runs west from Dundas Street West, past Keele Street to the school's main entrance. In 1909, the school was changed to \\"Humberside Collegiate Institute\\" and became part of the Toronto Board of Education when the Junction was annexed by the City of Toronto. In 1910 an addition was added by Charles Hartnoll Bishop.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1127 During World War I, many students lost their lives in battle. The front entrance is now a memorial to those who lost their lives, and for quite some time, it was not allowed to be used, until recently. Names were added to the memorial after World War II. The school's yearbook, Hermes, named for the Olympian god of the same name, was established in 1925. The student council was formed in 1931, and three decades later, the school held its first formal dance. In the late 1920s, Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer was commissioned by the school to paint what is thought to be the largest Canadian mural. After being restored the mural hangs in the school auditorium, which was renamed in 1992 as Lismer Hall. 1966 saw major renovations to the school. A new north wing was opened, which houses the science laboratories. A new library was also constructed, as well as a new structure at the back which housed the (then) new auditorium, and music facilities. In 1972, Humberside became one of the first schools to introduce computers as part of the curriculum. Extended French and French Immersion programs were introduced in 1980 and 1983, respectively. Humberside celebrated its centennial in 1992. In 1998, the TBE was dissolved and Humberside became part of the new Toronto District School Board (TDSB). The school was used in the filming of the TV movie Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life in 2005. In 2005, Mel Greif retired after thirty years of teaching history and geography. He won multiple awards for teaching, including the Jane Jacobs Prize and the Governor General's Award of Excellence.. Accessed April 18, 2013.

In her art and writing she \\"explores tensions between consciousness, feminism, and religious ritual tradition.\\" Early life Margolis was born into a Jewish family and Yiddish-speaking community in the Bronx, NY. In 1948 her family moved to suburban New Jersey, from which the adolescent Margolis would adventure to New York City for her early artistic education.  Early artistic training  Margolis began her artistic training during high school at age 15 with a drawing class at The Art Students League, then attended Cooper Union, where she met her first husband Albie Tabackman. The two traveled across the United States to California, where they lived at Magic Forest Farm in Oregon. Margolis also studied at Lone Mountain College in San Francisco, and has an MFA (1986) from the University of Southern California.  Travels  Margolis led an Orthodox Jewish life in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Israel before leaving the orthodoxy. And for the last 10 years, since leaving Orthodoxy, she has been slowly finding a balance between everything she has gained from her religious life and a retrieval of the freedoms that she believes are important for her art.  Career  Since 1996, Margolis has been the Art Editor of Nashim: The Journal of Jewish Women's Studies and Gender Issues, published by Indiana University Press. She was selected as one of ten international Common Ground artists. Margolis is Creative Director of Bright Idea Books, which produces limited edition and artist's books.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built for John Cradock in 1716 and was later altered by architect George Wilkinson. In 1783 extensive gardens, including parterres and water features, were laid out by William Emes. In 1809 the property was largely rebuilt in a two-storey seven bay Georgian style to designs by John Nash. It was further improved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by architect Douglas Caroe. The manor passed by female descent to the Fenton and Fletcher families and as a result of the 1814 marriage of Elizabeth Fenton to Francis Twemlow, to the Fletcher-Twemlow family. The house fell into disuse following the death in 1976 of Charles Fletcher-Twemlow. The Grade II listed stable block was converted to residential use and new houses were built in the grounds. New owners carried out extensive refurbishment to the House. In 2008 the current owners launched a garden restoration not-for- profit membership organisation called 'The Emes Society' (after William Emes - see above) with the intention of looking after the garden and developing it for the 21st Century, with open days for the public including, e.g. a Bluebell Walk. The formal part of the garden includes a magnificent Cedar of Lebanon planted by William Barron. On 23 August 2019 Betley Court suffered a devastating fire believed to have started in the roof space.

He is remembered as Riky≈´'s third-generation successor in Kyoto through whose efforts and by whose very being, as the blood-descendant of Riky≈´, the ideals and style of Japanese tea ceremony proposed by Riky≈´ were able to be passed forward by the family.  Biography  He was the son of Sen Sh≈çan and Okame, a daughter of Riky≈´, and is counted as the third generation in the three lines of the Sen family known together as the san-Senke (see Schools of Japanese tea ceremony). He helped to popularize tea in Japan. It was in the generation of his children, S≈çsa, S≈çshitsu and S≈çshu, that the three lines of the family‚Äîthe Omotesenke, Urasenke and Mushak≈çjisenke‚Äîwere established, with these three sons, respectively, as their heads of house. They are counted as the fourth generation in the respective lines. He had the original tea house constructed on the north side of the Sen residence and named it name Konnichi-an (‰ªäÊó•Â∫µ , \\"Hut of This Day\\").http://www.japanesegardens.jp/gardens/famous/konnichi- an.php At around the age of ten, he was sent to live at Daitoku-ji temple, through the wish of his grandfather, Riky≈´. He lived at the sub-temple Sangen'in, under the supervision of the priest Shunoku S≈çen.Genshoku Chad≈ç Daijiten Japanese chad≈ç encyclopedia, entry for \\"Sen S≈çtan\\" During the years following Riky≈´'s death, when the Sen family was disbanded and S≈çtan's father found shelter with the daimy≈ç Gam≈ç Ujisato in distant Aizu Wakamatsu, S≈çtan was able to stay safely at Daitoku-ji temple. When his father was at last permitted to return to Kyoto and reestablish the Kyoto Sen family, S≈çtan left the priesthood and returned to his family. His father soon left the headship of the family to S≈çtan, and moved out. S≈çtan had two sons by his first wife, and after her death, two more sons by his second wife. He had a falling out with his oldest son, and consequently there are only very scanty records concerning that son. S≈çtan arranged for his second son, Ichi≈ç S≈çshu, to be adopted into the family of a lacquer ware artisan at a young age. S≈çshu, however, later on chose to carry on the tea tradition of his forefather, Riky≈´, and built a tea house where he was living at on Mushak≈çji street, to dedicate himself to that pursuit. He gave up the lacquer business to the lacquer ware artisan Nakamura S≈çtetsu. This represents the birth of the Nakamura S≈çtetsu line of lacquer ware artisans who have been responsible for much of the lacquer ware of the Sen families, as well as the birth of the Mushak≈çjisenke (Mushak≈çji Sen house/family) line of the Sen family. Meanwhile, S≈çtan had his third son, K≈çshin S≈çsa, become heir to the Sen house, which eventually came to be referred to as the Omotesenke (front Sen house/family), while he set up his retirement quarters on adjacent property. S≈çtan had his fourth and youngest son, Sens≈ç S≈çshitsu, adopted into the family of a doctor, but after a few years the doctor died and so S≈çshitsu returned to live with S≈çtan. Eventually, he became heir to the retirement quarters, and the family there came to be known as the Urasenke (rear Sen house/family). Also, among S≈çtan's chanoyu followers, there were four who were especially close and active in the world of chanoyu. They are referred to as S≈çtan's \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" (ÂõõÂ§©Áéã, Shitenn≈ç). They were Fujimura Y≈çken (1613‚Äì99), Sugiki Fusai (1628‚Äì1706), Yamada S≈çhen (1627‚Äì1708), and Kusumi Soan (1636‚Äì1728).

The district had been represented by Republican Roger Wicker since 1995. The district has demonstrated itself to be \\"reliably conservative\\" in past elections, with George W. Bush winning the district by 25 points in the 2004 presidential election.A House Race Holds Clues for GOP, Susan Davis, The Wall Street Journal, May 13, 2008. Early speculation had Republicans Greg Davis, Glenn McCullough, and Randy Russell and Democrats Steve Holland and Jamie Franks as contenders. All but Franks ended up as candidates. The party primaries were held on March 11. The primary runoff election was held on April 1, 2008. According to Mississippi state election law, those who voted in the Democratic Primary on March 11 were only allowed to vote in the Democratic runoff on April 1. Mississippi was one of the states where right wing commentators such as Rush Limbaugh suggested people cross party lines on March 11 in order to keep the competition alive between Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Several websites such as the Daily Kos \\"DailyKos:' Limbaugh's system-gaming could give us a new Democratic congressman ] and politico.com suggested that this is why the Republican primary runoff was so close between the more moderate McCullough and Davis as many of the more Conservative Republicans were not allowed to vote in that runoff. It is also believed that this has led to the final special election race involving a conservative Democrat (Childers) who has a better than usual chance to win the general election. Republicans were particularly concerned that a race between Childers and McCullough would've increased the Democrat's chances. The initial special election to fill the seat was held on April 22, 2008; no one received a majority of the vote so a runoff election was held between the two top vote getters: Democrat Travis Childers (who was the top vote getter with 49.4% of the vote) and Republican Greg Davis (who received 46.3% of the initial special election vote) on May 13, 2008. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent over $1.3 million in support of Davis' bid for the vacant seat. Freedom's Watch, a Republican-supporting advocacy group, purchased an additional $550,000 in advertising. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $1.5 million in support of Childers. Despite the district's Republican leanings, Childers defeated Davis in the final round of the special election by a 54% to 46% margin.Miss. Democrat wins House seat in special election, Emily Waggster Pettus, Associated Press, May 13, 2008. Once sworn in, Childers will serve through the end of the 110th Congress in January 2009. Childers victory represents the 3rd time during the 110th Congress that a Democrat has been elected to a previously Republican-held seat in a special election. Childers victory is seen as a surprise upset for the Republican party as Mississippi's 1st district has been historically right leaning. It is believed that this sends \\"a clear signal of national problems ahead for Republicans in the fall\\". Negative campaign ads approved by Davis tried to link Childers with presidential candidate Barack Obama and his controversial former pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Childers and Davis faced off against each other in the November general election. Again, Childers won that contest. =ResultsRunoff results=Newspaper endorsements Childers was endorsed by the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, The Commercial Dispatch, and The Commercial Appeal.

It was named after John Thornton Kirkland, president of Harvard University from 1810 to 1828. Background Some of the buildings were built in 1914 but construction was not completed until 1933. Kirkland is one of the smallest Houses at Harvard, but has nevertheless managed to win many intramural and house-spirit contests, most recently the 2012 Straus Cup. Before Harvard opted to use a lottery system to assign housing to upperclassmen, Kirkland was considered the \\"jock house\\" because its location near Anderson Bridge and the Soldiers Field made it a desirable home and convenient place to dine for Harvard athletes. The Kirkland House Boat Club last won the Agassiz Cup in 2003 The first Master of Kirkland House was Edward A. Whitney. Walter Eugene Clark succeeded Whitney as the second Master on September 1, 1935. The title of \\"House Master\\" was done away with at Harvard University in 2016 and was replaced with the title \\"Faculty Dean.\\" The current Faculty Deans of Kirkland House are Tom and Verena Conley, and the current Allston Burr Academic Dean is Soha Bayoumi, PhD.House Masters: Tom and Verena Conley. Retrieved 26 June 2013. Kirkland House boasts many traditions, such as its opening ceremony (complete with Minutemen reenactors playing the drums and fife as they process around the House, followed by the house Faculty Deans, tutors, and students), Secret Santa week (an in-house-only series of gifts, jokes, and events) -- accompanied by bawdy skits in the dining hall, and a Holiday Dinner and Dance complete with a mock roast boar. Kirkland House has a gym, lounge, game room, music rooms, and performance and event spaces for students. It also has a wall honoring the history of the Kirkland House Boat Club, which has one of the most decorated records in all of Harvard house rowing. Most recently, head coach Christopher D.H. Row‚Äîa resident tutor, art history doctorate and master of divinity‚Äîled the KHBC to five consecutive Agassiz Cup victories (1999-2003) and was awarded by the KHBC the title of \\"Admiral-for-Life\\" in recognition of that accomplishment. Among the most recent additions is a brewery, operated and maintained by the Kirkland House Brew Club, which occupies the space once used as the house darkroom. Kirkland House is located four blocks south of Harvard Yard, adjacent to Eliot House, and across Dunster Street from the Malkin Athletic Center. The House Shield is a black cross with three silver stars on a red field. The black cross is drawn from the arms of the Diocese of Carlisle (where the name Kirkland originated). The stars are drawn from the arms of the many branches of the Kirkland family. Due to the shield's perceived resemblance to the Confederate battle flag, Harvard College endorsed the use of an alternate House shield.College Approves Kirkland House Shield Change. Retrieved 21 February 2020. Constituent halls A view facing the Kirkland House dining hall, in May. Kirkland House comprises the following three halls: * Smith Halls * Bryan Hall * Faculty Deans' Residence * Hicks House * 20 DeWolfe Street apartments Smith Halls, which were constructed in 1914 as freshman dormitories; Bryant Hall and the Masters' Residence, both constructed in 1931; and Hicks House, which dates from 1762 and serves as the House Library. Kirkland students also live in the 20 DeWolfe Street apartments. Located in Smith Halls, the dining hall and Junior Common Room boast magnificent woodwork and high ceilings that highlight Kirkland's classic charm and elegance.

Failla (born December 8, 1972) is a former American football and baseball player and coach. College career Failla was recruited out of North Allegheny Senior High School in Wexford, Pennsylvania by the University of Notre Dame, where he was a two-sport athlete, playing shortstop for the baseball team, and backing up starting quarterbacks Rick Mirer and Kevin McDougal on the football team for three years, from 1991‚Äì1993. When it became clear that he would not win the starting quarterback job in 1994, he entered the Major League Baseball Draft, and was selected by the California Angels in the third round. Following stints with the Boise Hawks, the Cedar Rapids Kernels and the Lake Elsinore Storm in the minor-league system, he decided to return to school in 1998, and used his final year of NCAA eligibility playing quarterback at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where he led the team to a 10‚Äì2 record and a playoff berth. Professional career After his graduation from IUP, Failla signed with the Arena Football League's New Jersey Red Dogs in 1999, and with the National Football League's Carolina Panthers in 2000, but failed to record a stat with either team. In 2001, he was drafted by the Chicago Enforcers of the XFL with the ninth overall selection, but lost the starting quarterback job to fellow Notre Dame alum Kevin McDougal. After the XFL folded at the conclusion of its only season, Failla accepted the position of offensive coordinator at Saint Francis University, where in the 2005 season his offense set school records for passing yards (3,223), total offense (4,479) and touchdowns (37). He groomed multiple all-conference players including quarterback Anthony Doria (NEC offensive player of the year), wide receiver Luke Palko, running back Todd Harris, and Division I-AA All-American wide receiver Micheal Caputo and Quarterback / wide receiver Joe DeLeo. Under Failla, Palko and Caputo tied the NCAA Division I record for most passes caught by two teammates in a career. He then returned to his alma mater at IUP in February 2006 as the offensive coordinator under head coach Lou Tepper, but resigned three months later to pursue business interests. He is currently featured as a regular guest on Pittsburgh's KDKA Sports Showdown.

The line-up consists of founder member Dillie Keane; Ad√®le Anderson, who joined in 1984; and Liza Pulman, who first joined in 2004. The group received a Perrier Award nomination at the 1984 Edinburgh Festival, and went on to be nominated three times for the Olivier Award for Best Entertainment (1995, 2000 and 2004), and twice for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue (2005 and 2010). Keane and Anderson were also nominated for the 2010 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics. Their name is derived from the expletive exclamation 'F**king Ada!', which appears in the text of Alan Bennett's play The History Boys (2004), and is also the name of a song by Ian Dury. History (from left to right) Ad√®le Anderson, Dillie Keane and Marilyn Cutts performing in Barefaced Chic! at the Lyric Hammersmith Fascinating A√Øda was founded in March 1983 by Dillie Keane, along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been Ad√®le Anderson ‚Äì who joined the group in 1984 ‚Äì and Keane. The trio started performing in a West End wine bar, but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983. Over the years they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three Olivier Award nominations for Best Entertainment, in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted 'Most Popular Act 1985' by City Limits magazine, and also earned a Perrier Comedy Award nomination. The group broke up in 1989 and subsequently reformed in 1994, performing for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, One Last Flutter, ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the Comedy Theatre in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time. The show earned the group their third Olivier Award nomination. Liza Pulman joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show Absolutely Fabulous twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan. The show earned them a 2005 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Revue. In 2007, Keane stated on the welcome page on the Fascinating A√Øda official website that \\"Next year will be our 25th anniversary so we really want to do a new show to celebrate\\". The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as Stop The Week, After Hours, People Like Us and the breakfast broadcaster TV-am. Some of their most famous songs include Shattered Illusions, Herpes Tango, Lieder and Taboo. They were the subject of several BBC documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in The Stage magazine for ten years, and written two books, The Joy of Sequins in 1995 and Fascinating Who? in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time \\"juggling acting, cabaret and writing\\". The group have an official mascot‚Äîa pure bred Irish setter called \\"Dillie\\", born in 1999. After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director Russell Churney, plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs. In 2008 they performed at the Jermyn Street Theatre, followed by three nationwide tours.

The Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. Fanjingshan is a sacred mountain in Chinese Buddhism, considered to be the bodhima·πá·∏ça of the Maitreya Buddha. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018.  Name  The mountain's name \\"Fanjing\\" is an abbreviation of Fantian Jingtu (), or \\"Brahma's Pure Land\\". Fantian is the Chinese name for the Buddhist heavenly king BrahmƒÅ, and Jingtu is Chinese for \\"pure land\\", the focus of Pure Land Buddhism.  Location and environment  Fanjingshan is located in Tongren, Guizhou Province in southwest China. It is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains. The elevation of its terrain ranges from above sea level. The Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. The reserve covers a total area of and is a conservation area for primitive vegetation of the mid sub-tropic alpine region of western China. The mountain was designated a World Heritage Site in July 2018. Fanjingshan's relative isolation has ensured a high degree of biodiversity. Endemic species such as the rare Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi) and the Fanjingshan fir (Abies fanjingshanensis) occur only in a small region centering on Fanjingshan. Several endangered species, including the Chinese giant salamander, forest musk deer, and Reeve's pheasant are also found in Fanjingshan. It is also home to the largest and most contiguous subtropical primeval beech forest.  Buddhism  Fanjingshan The Mushroom Rock Fanjingshan is considered a sacred mountain of Chinese Buddhism, ranking just below the Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism. It is considered the bodhima·πá·∏ça (or daochang)‚Äîa spot in which one reached enlightenment‚Äîof the Maitreya Buddha. The influence of Buddhism reached Fanjingshan by the Tang dynasty at the latest, especially after Hou Hongren () constructed the Zangke Road () in 639 AD, which facilitated transport in the mountainous region, and local gazettes record the construction of several temples in the area. More temples were built during the ensuing Song and Yuan dynasties. Buddhism greatly prospered during the Ming and Qing dynasties, when the cult of Tianguan Maitreya () became dominant in Fanjingshan. The Bozhou rebellion in the late 16th century caused great damages to Fanjingshan's temples. After suppressing the rebellion, the Wanli Emperor ordered the monk Miaoxuan () to rebuild the Golden Peak and the Cheng'en Temple (). Many other temples were constructed in the area, ushering in the golden era for Buddhism in Fanjingshan. Most temples during the Ming and Qing dynasties belonged to the Pure Land and the Linji sects of Buddhism. In the turmoil that toppled the Qing dynasty, many temples were destroyed by marauding armies and bandits, and few monks remained in the Republic of China era. After further destructions during the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism has enjoyed a renaissance since the 1980s. Many old temples have been rebuilt and new ones constructed, including the Cheng'en Temple, Huguo Chan Temple (), Great Golden Buddha Temple (), and Longquan Temple (). In 2010, the Fanjingshan Buddhist Cultural Park was opened, with a Golden Hall that houses a five-meter-tall statue of the Maitreya Buddha made with of gold and thousands of gems. It is said to be the largest gold Maitreya statue in the world.

Bradley House, also known as Mrs. Josephine Crane Bradley Residence, is a Prairie School home designed by Louis H. Sullivan and George Grant Elmslie. It is located in the University Heights Historic District of Madison, Wisconsin, United States. A National Historic Landmark, it is one of just a few residential designs by Sullivan, and one of only two Sullivan designs in Wisconsin.  History  George Grant Elmslie joined the architectural partnership of Adler & Sullivan in 1888. Following the dismissal of Frank Lloyd Wright from the firm, and especially once the partnership dissolved, Elmslie's role under Louis Sullivan increased. Elmslie was entrusted with the design of the main facade of the Gage Building and of all of the details of the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building. The Bradley House, intended for professor Harold C. Bradley, was designed at a time when Sullivan's architectural practice was starting to fail. Once considered the foremost designer of skyscrapers, Sullivan now struggled to secure commissions and often sparred with clients. The Bradley House was \\"designed by Elmslie with only occasional suggestions from Sullivan.\\" All drawings of the building were sketched by Elmslie and many of the architectural details are consistent with the style he would develop later in his career with William Gray Purcell. The Bradley House was the last building Elmslie designed while with Sullivan; he left to partner with Purcell in 1909. An elaborate design was initially planned for the Bradley House with a cruciform design. It featured a living room and force to the rear, a library and kitchen on the two wings, and a porte-coch√®re on the main entrance. Bays projected out of the house, lined with casement windows. However, the Bradleys rejected this draft as too large. Elmslie reenvisioned the house on a smaller scale and included a pair of cantilevered sleeping porches on the second floor. Sullivan was probably responsible for the idea of the sleeping porches, though Elmslie was responsible for integrating them into the final design. Elmslie was not satisfied with the result when the house was completed. The Harold C. Bradley House was entered in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. It has been occupied and maintained by the Sigma Phi Society, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison chapter since 1915. The blueprints of the Bradley House are held in the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections at the University of Illinois Library in Urbana‚ÄìChampaign.

This includes the group administered Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Second Edition and the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Online version. The most current version is NNAT3. Like all nonverbal ability tests, the NNAT is intended to assess cognitive ability independently of linguistic and cultural background.  Present use  These tests may be administered to K-12 school children on an individual or group basis as a means to identify potentially gifted children for placement in accelerated programs.  NNAT and the media  Beginning in the 2012-13 school year, the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test- 2nd Edition (NNAT-2) replaced the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA).http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0E2224D7-DF21-42DA-8C9E-BC4FDEC157FB/0/NYCGiftedandTalentedAssessmentFAQ_413.pdf The decision sparked some degree of controversy The NNAT-2 is considered significantly harder than the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA) which it replaced. In New York City, the NNAT-2 makes up 50% of the gifted and talented exam, the other 50% is the Otis‚ÄìLennon School Ability Test (OLSAT).  Criticism  The NNAT has been found by one study to show excessive score variability, with within-grade standard deviations reaching as high as 20 points. This has the effect of both overrepresenting and underrepresenting index scores - that is, more students received very high or very low scores than expected. Lohman et al. found that 3.4 times as many students scored in the 130+ range on the NNAT as expected.

Development The engine was announced at the 2006 National Business Aviation Association convention. Certification was originally slated for the end of 2010 or early 2011. In early 2008 the high pressure spool and combustor have been run in a US$120 million core-demonstrator called SM-X, reaching the take-off speed of 20,300rpm. Falcon 5X Model at the 2015 Paris Air Show The First Engine To Test started ground testing in September 2012. In May 2013, in-flight tests were targeted for the fourth quarter of the year. They finally started in July 2014 on a Grumman Gulfstream II and should take place in Istres-Le Tub√© Air Base. In 2015, engine certification was rescheduled for late 2016. In 2015, Safran passed ‚Ç¨654 million of depreciation for amortization for the Silvercrest program. In November 2016, issues were traced to airflow through the engine not as controlled as expected, a side-effect of the axial-centrifugal high- pressure compressor selection, controlling software was adapted to maintain a steady airflow and active clearance controls were added to the low pressure turbine ; in May 2017, altitude tests should begin soon in Russia for an early 2018 certification. The Silvercrest 2D was to power the Dassault Falcon 5X and the 2C the Cessna Citation Hemisphere, EASA certification was expected in spring 2018 and FAA certification in August 2018. In October 2017, after Safran discovered high-pressure compressor response problems at high altitudes and low airspeeds on its flying testbed in San Antonio, Dassault announced the Falcon 5X introduction could be further delayed after 50 test flight hours, and do not rule out switching its engine supplier. An axial-centrifugal high- pressure compressor is common below but rare for the range. Textron Aviation declared that they were confident that these problems will be solved when it powers the Citation Hemisphere. Until 2015, issues were mostly oil-fuel heat exchanger problems, carcass distortion and clearance control challenges of the high-pressure section. Optimizing the settings, the control laws and positioning of the variable stator vanes will recover a part of the losses, but not all. Flowpath will not be too modified and no stages or vanes will be added, the fixes selection will establish the length of the delay and the schedule will be revised before 2017 ends to recover all the surge margin and to operate as planned across the flight envelope. The problem is due to the axial part, not the centrifugal, and is not related to the overall compressor architecture. At this time the test engines had logged 800 flights, and the one concerned had 90 hours, including 30 hours on the ground and 60 hours in the air. On 13 December 2017, Dassault abandoned the Silvercrest due to technical and schedule risks, ended the 5X development and launched a new Falcon with the same cross section, Pratt & Whitney Canada engines and a range for a 2022 introduction. Compliant Silvercrest engines were originally planned for the end of 2013 but technical issues led Safran to postpone them to the end of 2017, leading to delay the 5X introduction from 2017 to 2020, and the high pressure compressor issues in the fall of 2017 delayed it further with performance shortfalls, preventing a 2020 service entry. In December 2017, Textron Aviation declared that the Silvercrest delays did not impact the Hemisphere programme with a first flight still planned in 2019 and an introduction after 2020 and Textron confirmed its selection for the Hemisphere after Dassault cancelled the 5X. However, in April 2018, they declared that they suspended the Hemisphere Program because of the ongoing problems with the Silvercrest engine. In May 2018, Safran announced it had launched a high- pressure compressor redesign for a go-ahead decision by the middle of 2019, after testing, shelving the Hemisphere program if problems cannot be fixed. The redesigned compressor will be tested in July 2019 to prove the engine operation. By October 2018, Safran had amassed over 9,000 test hours and 300 in flight. Safran needs a second customer to justify its investment, but is still optimistic for the engine's future. In July 2019, Textron suspended the Cessna Citation Hemisphere development as its turbofans did not meet objectives: the new high pressure compressor exceeded expectations during ground tests but further trials are necessary to \\"confirm engine improvements and complete overall engine performance and durability validation\\" and Safran will continue the effort as an \\"R&T; platform\\". For Safran, insufficient skills retention is causing the repetition of technical issues as design engineers retire.  Design  presented at EBACE 2018 It was originally designed as an thrust turbofan. It should power super mid-size to large cabin business jets or 40 to 60-seat regional jets with a Maximum Takeoff Weight of . In 2016 the thrust range was quoted as . The two-shaft engine architecture includes a fan with solid wide-chord swept blades, followed by 4 booster stages, all driven by a 4-stage low pressure turbine. The high pressure spool has 4 axial compressor stages and 1 centrifugal stage, driven by a single- stage turbine. An axi-centrifugal compressor is unusual for an engine in this thrust range. Turbomeca, which like Snecma is a part of the SAFRAN Group, participates in the design of the centrifugal compressor stage. Design in 2007 featured a smaller 40-inch fan, no booster, one more high-pressure compressor stage, one low-pressure turbine stage less and a lower 4.5 bypass ratio, a 27:1 overall pressure ratio and a core pressure ratio of \\"over 17\\".

San Paolo Maggiore is a basilica church in Naples, southern Italy, and the burial place of Gaetano Thiene, known as Saint Cajetan, founder of the Order of Clerics Regular (or Theatines). It is located on Piazza Gaetano, about 1-2 blocks north of Via dei Tribunali. History The Baroque style church is located on the site of the 1st-century temple of the Dioscuri. The church was built upon the ruins of that temple. The church occupied the area behind the temple's pronaos. The front section of the latter, including six columns and triangular tympanum, was visible until 1688, when it was destroyed by an earthquake. The current church includes two corinthian columns from the ancient edifice. They stand awkwardly in front, linked by a fragile beam projecting from the facade. The church erected here in the 8th-9th century was dedicated to St. Paul to celebrate a victory in 574 of the Duchy of Naples against pillaging Saracens.* In 1538, the building was ceded to St Cajetan and his order of Theatines. Cajetan had been in Naples for six years working on building his order. The Theatine priest and architect Francesco Grimaldi designed the adjacent house for the order. In the early 1580s, general reconstruction of the church began with the erection of the transept and the polygonal apse. This was followed by the nave built by Gian Battista Cavagni. The aisles, designed by Giovan Giacomo di Conforto, date from 1625 onwards. As the building was proceeding, it was decorated and embellished, notably by Massimo Stanzione who painted the nave ceiling with a series of canvases depicting events in the life of St Paul. On the occasion of the canonization of the Order's founder, St. Cajetan, Dionisio Lazzaro unsuccessfully connected the fa√ßade with the temple's columns with a wall, causing the building to crumble in 1688. The decoration continued in the 18th century with, among others, Domenico Antonio Vaccaro and Francesco Solimena, who re-used marble elements from the ancient edifice for the new pavement and the pilasters of the nave. The church was severely damaged by an Allied bombing in 1943, which caused the nearly total destruction of Massimo Stanzione's frescoes. Interior The interior is on the Latin cross plan. The nave has remains of Stanzione's frescoes depicting Histories of Sts. Paul and Peter. Other frescoes by Francesco Solimena can be seen in the sacristy. In the nave there is also a statue of the Guardian Angel (1712) by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro. Notable, especially for their marble decorations, are the Chapels of Firrao di Sant'Agata and the Madonna della Purit√†, both dating from the 17th centuries. The main altar was sculpted in 1775-1776 to a design by Ferdinando Fuga. Cloister The cloister was built during the Theatine reconstruction of the late 16th century, occupying the former pagan temple. The vestibule uses columns taken from the former Palaeo-Christian church; the cloister itself has a square plan with, in its center, a well supported by small columns. The frescoes on the walls, one of which was attributed to Aniello Falcone, have disappeared.

Biography  Mann was raised in rural Tennessee; his parents owned a lumber business. He sang in church and did country songs for local talent shows, playing guitar and piano. In 1957, he released his first single on Jaxon Records, \\"Gonna Rock and Roll Tonight\\" b/w \\"Rockin' Love.\\" Several further singles on Jaxon followed, after which Carl Perkins' drummer, W.S. Holland, became Mann's manager, signing him to Sun Records.[ Biography], AllMusic Sun owner Sam Phillips signed Mann to a three- year contract, and soon after Sun released Mann's rockabilly version of Nat King Cole's \\"Mona Lisa.\\" Mann and Conway Twitty both released single versions of the tune at the same time, and both charted; it was sixteen-year-old Mann's first hit, peaking at No. 24 on the US R&B; Singles chart and No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. Mann's follow-up singles were less successful; he covered several pop standards, but the only charting hit was 1959's \\"Pretend,\\" which peaked at No. 57 Pop. An LP, Like Mann, was released in 1960 but did not sell well, and Mann began to drift from the business. He did a stint in the Army in 1964, and then released a single, \\"Down to My Last I Love You,\\" on Monument Records; after it failed, he returned to family life and battled problems with alcoholism. Mann returned as a country artist in 1974, releasing singles on ABC and Dot. His 1976 single \\"Twilight Time\\" scraped the US Country Singles chart, peaking at No. 100. In 1977, he landed a deal with Dutch record label Rockhouse Records, who released a live/studio split Gonna Rock'n'Roll Tonight in 1978 and In Rockabilly Country in 1981. He toured occasionally in Europe in the 1980s, but eventually returned once again to running the family logging outfit. Mann came out of music retirement in 2005, performing on the local Huntingdon Hayride radio show in his hometown. He continues to perform overseas and in the states, and record. A CD called Rockabilly Highway, featuring Mann, and Sun Records label mates W. S. Holland and Rayburn Anthony, was released in 2008. He was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in Jackson, Tennessee, in 2006. In May 2011, a book on his life and music career called The Last Son of Sun was released. Mann continues to perform to date, including at Sun Record showcases in Las Vegas, \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" at Orleans Hotel in Vegas. Nashville's \\"Ink and Iron\\", and other venues.

The hotel was built in 1864‚Äì65 to serve railroad and steamboat travelers coming to the city. The hotel was named after Hercules L. Dousman, an early Wisconsin fur trader, land speculator and millionaire. The hotel operated until the 1920s; it was later converted to a meatpacking plant. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its significance as one of the last grand hotels to survive from the 19th century railroad and steamboat era.Blanche Higgins Schroer (Undated) , National Park Service and In the early 21st century, it was undergoing restoration. Its ground floor has opened as a restaurant and event venue known as the Dousman House. Description The Dousman Hotel is a three-story brick building with a Mid-Victorian design. Due to additions and neglect, many of the building's decorative features are no longer intact. The brick quoins at the corners and arched moldings around the windows are the most prominent remaining elements of the original design. The hotel once had a square cupola and a bracketed cornice; both have been removed, though the cupola was eventually replaced. The building's original front porch, which ran along the center block of the front facade, is also gone. The hotel's original interior included fifty-one guest rooms and a dining room, though these were later gutted. History The Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad built the Dousman Hotel next to its train depot in 1864‚Äì65. The hotel was named for fur trader Hercules L. Dousman, who had interests in both the steamboat and railroad industries, as well as lumber and real estate. At the time he was regarded as Prairie du Chien's most prominent resident and became a millionaire before his death, when there were few in the United States. Travelers on both the river and the railroad frequented the hotel, which was considered the most luxurious of the city's hotels at the time. The hotel's proximity to the Milwaukee and Mississippi station made it a convenient choice for rail travelers. The hotel was a financial success and remained in operation through 1925. After its closure, meatpacking plants occupied the hotel from 1939 to 1952; during this time, several additions were placed on the hotel, and its original interior was destroyed. The hotel was used for storage by other businesses after 1952, but by the 1960s it had been abandoned and became derelict. The building has since been restored, and a hotel once again operates in this space.

Vision Health, equity, and security for all people in their communities Mission To be a leader, partner, catalyst, and voice for local public health departments. History The history of NACCHO dates back to the 1960s, with the formation of the National Association of County Health Officials (NACHO), an independent affiliate of the National Association of Counties. As the U.S. federal, state, and local public health systems continued to expand, NACHO combined with the U.S. Conference of Local Health Officers, an organization affiliated with the United States Conference of Mayors, to form the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) in 1994. This unified organization more closely represents all governmental local health departments, including counties, cities, city/counties, districts, and townships. In 2001, NACCHO expanded its scope to include tribal public health agencies serving tribal communities on reservation lands and in 2012 to include counties and cities in the U.S. territories. Today, active membership in NACCHO continues to grow with about 2,800 local health departments. Governance NACCHO is governed by a 27-member Board of Directors composed of health officials from around the country elected by their peers, a representative for Tribal health departments, and ex officio members representing the National Association of Counties, of which NACCHO is an affiliate, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The Board of Directors meets four times a year. The NACCHO Executive Committee includes four NACCHO officers and three Board members representing different geographic regions and population size. Approximately 380 NACCHO members serve on 40 committees and workgroups. Most committees meet by conference call and have one face-to-face meeting each year ReferencesExternal links Category:Public health organizations Category:Medical and health organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Biography Sens≈ç S≈çshitsu was the youngest son of Sen no S≈çtan; and he was a great-grandson of Sen no Riky≈´. Before becoming the head of the Urasenke line of the Sen family, he studied under a physician of Kyoto named Noma Gentaku, aiming to become a physician. Due to the death of Noma, however, he returned to live with his father and concentrate on making a life of carrying on the chad≈ç tradition of the Sen family, founded by his great-grandfather, Sen no Riky≈´.

He spent a great deal of his life in Kanazawa, and his first son, who succeeded him as the fifth head of the Urasenke line of the Sen family, Fuky≈´sai J≈çs≈ç, was born in Kanazawa. Sens≈ç finally retired from his position with Tsunatoshi and returned to Kyoto when he was sixty-six years old, though he continued to make visits to Kanazawa on occasion, and that is where he died on the 23rd day of the 1st month of 1697, at the age of seventy-five.Section on the biography of the Fourth-Generation Grand Master, Sens≈ç S≈çshitsu, in Chanoyu: The Urasenke Tradition of Tea.

History  The Strand Theater was constructed and managed by Gioachino and Rosalia Sapienza in 1914 along Main Street (U.S. Route 19) in downtown Zelienople. It is one of the oldest movie theaters in Butler County. The theater was not only used for showing feature films, but was also used as a performing arts center. It featured silent films with live piano accompaniment as well as Vaudeville- style shows on its small stage.Strand Theater Initiative During its long run as a theater, it was owned and/or managed by the Sapienza, Evans, Thomas, and Nalevanko families, all from Zelienople. Local teenage boys and girls were hired as ushers for many years, showing customers to their seats with a flashlight. The price of admission for adults was 10 cents during the 1930s and 50 cents during the 1950s (children under 12 for less).Strand Theater Initiative The Strand closed down in the mid-1980s and sat abandoned for over 20 years. One of the last films shown there was Top Gun with a release date of May 12, 1986. Another was Wildcats with a release date Feb 14, 1986.IMDB Wildcats In 2001, the Strand Theater Initiative was formed by the residents of Zelienople and surrounding communities in hopes of saving the structure. Over the next four years, the initiative would set up certain activities in the area to help with the fundraising. By 2006, enough funds were collected to start the renovation process. In the summer of 2007, work began on the interior of the theater, as the floor and seats were removed for the building restoration. A complete rebuilding of the structure began in the spring of 2008 and took nearly a year to complete. The theater reopened in late July 2009, with the first patrons through the doors being Mr. Alan Tomo and his daughter Madeleine.Pittsburgh Post Gazette \\"The Strand Theater Returns\\"  Current Events  The Strand Theater currently shows classic and new movies Friday and Saturday evenings, as well as Sundays during the afternoon.

Canals in Hackney Users Group Kingsland Basin is home to Canals in Hackney Users Group (CHUG), a local charity. Founded in 1983, it was set up to 'promote use of the canal in Hackney'. In the early 1980s a Hackney Council grant to generate affordable housing enabled the dredging of the abandoned basin, and the setting up of moorings for residential boats. CHUG ºs key activities over the last three decades focused on educating about the canal and its environmental and historical facets, and advocating its use by working with schools and local organisations. CHUG actively improved the canal environment, and campaigned for sustainable development around the basin. CHUG works with the Laburnum Boat Club, which uses the basin as a training space. CHUG supports LBC with resources and funds for sporting activities. CHUG still manages and maintains the moorings. The self-managed moorings, unique in the UK, provide affordable residential moorings in central London. The redevelopment of Kingsland Basin may affect CHUG's ability to do this in the future.

In the 1920s she helped establish the original London Film Society, and was the first curator of the film department of the Museum of Modern Art, New York City in 1935. Life Barry was born Iris Sylvia Crump, in the Washwood Heath district of Birmingham, England. She was the daughter of Alfred Charles Crump and Annie Crump. She studied at the Ursuline convent, Verviers, Belgium. She moved to London in 1916 or 1917, where she met Ezra Pound. She had two children with Wyndham Lewis, a boy in 1919, and daughter in 1920. According to scholar Yolanda Morato, the avant-garde had a very strong impact on her during this period; the essence of her first book on the cinema as art is to be found in these years. As Barry spent the war years going to the cinema, when she wrote her book Let's go to the pictures (1926), she explicitly stated: \\"Going to the pictures is nothing to be ashamed of\\" (viii). In 1923 she met the American poet Alan Porter (1899‚Äì1942), assistant literary editor of The Spectator, and published a poem in the magazine in July 1923. During their engagement The Spectator also favorably reviewed her first novel, Splashing into Society. She and Porter were married on October 8, 1923, the name Felix Porter appearing in the marriage record. She began publishing film criticism in The Spectator in 1923, and was film correspondent for the Daily Mail between 1925 and 1930, when she emigrated to the United States. Her marriage to Alan Porter did not long survive the move. The Film Society, the first of its kind, was launched in October 1925; she was one of its founders along with cinema owner Sidney Bernstein, film director Adrian Brunel, well-connected enthusiast Ivor Montagu, and fellow film critic Walter Mycroft. She is best remembered as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, which had opened in 1929. After immigrating to the United States in 1930, she founded the film study department in 1932, with an archival collection of rare films, library of film-related books, and a film circulation program. She also collected films. She became an American citizen in 1941, and married John E. Abbott. Barry wrote a book on moviegoing Let's Go to the Pictures (1926) and the scholarly classic D. W. Griffith: American Film Master (1940), and became a regular book reviewer for the New York Herald Tribune. In 1949, she was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French government, in recognition of her services to French cinema. She died 22 December 1969, in Marseilles. MoMA's Film Library The cinema studies scholar Haidee Wasson argues that under Barry's direction the MoMA's Film Library, the first American institution of film art, created the cultural and intellectual climate that allowed \\"selected films to become visible to an emergent public under the rubrics of art and history,\\" served as a \\"promulgator of discourses about cultural value and productive leisure,\\" and consequently defined \\"what objects and media matter within the politics of cultural value and visual knowledge\\". Wasson further details MoMA's director's Alfred Barr and Iris Barry's continuous struggle to affirm the cultural status and value of cinema to powerful museum benefactors and to win over Hollywood film studios' support in order to elevate cinema's status to that of a unique American art form. Wasson elaborates on MoMA's Film Library's effort to create modern audience for art cinema by employing overt disciplinary strategies. The staff of the Film Library, and sometimes Barry herself, carefully monitored the spectator's behavior in the cinematic salon, sanctioning improper conduct (e.g. rowdiness, excessive chatter or laughter during screening etc.) by, at times, even terminating the film screening altogether. These strategies, Wasson argues, sought to mold a new form of cinematic audience by instilling the values of \\"educated film viewing and studious attention\\". Through her work at MoMA's Film Library, Barry gained recognition as one of the founding figures of the film preservation movement alongside Henri Langlois (in France) and Ernest Lindgren (in Great Britain). On October 10, 2014, MoMA presented an illustrated talk by Robert Sitton, author of Lady in the Dark: Iris Barry and the Art of Film.MoMA Member Calendar, October 2014 Works *Splashing into society.

The religion first entered the country in 1987, when a Ghanaian missionary belonging to the Ahmadiyya movement visited Guadalcanal island on a reconnaissance trip lasting three years. Today, there are two major denominations in the country - Ahmadi Muslims and Sunni Muslims. According to a 2007 report by the United States Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report, there are approximately 350 Muslims in the country. However, different reports suggest that there may be 1000 Ahmadi Muslims in the country alone. Sub groups=Ahmadiyya= Islam was first introduced by an Ahmadi Muslim missionary, Hafiz Jibrail from Ghana. He visited the country from 1987 for three years and managed to draw a handful of converts to Islam, after which he left for Ghana. The Community then continued to flourish and practice their faith for a period lasting over a decade, with no external contact from members of the international Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. In the years 2000 to 2005, the Community sent another missionary, as a result of which the Community grew to approximately 1000 members. The Community is headquartered in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, and is present in the villages of Guadalcanal, Russells, Savo and Bellona islands. =Sunni= Sunni Muslims first entered the country in 1995 as a result of dawah efforts from members of the Tablighi Jamaat. Sunni Muslims have publicly differentiated from Ahmadi Muslims and claim to represent the 'true' orthodox Islam. The Community claims to have more members than the Ahmadiyya Community.

Located in the unincorporated community of Leisyville, the air strip is a single, long runway with houses running the length of the field on the north of the strip. History The airpark was started by Bill Olinger in the late 1950s and opened in 1958. Olinger was selling empty lots on the airstrip in the early 1960s for $1,800, which included a partial ownership of the airport itself. In February 1975, a plane that took off from the field crashed 20 minutes later as the pilots practiced aerobatic maneuvers, killing one person. The strip was built on the site of a former hop farm and had grown to 12 homes along the strip in 1976. Details The runway at the air park is a turf strip, which is maintained by the homeowners association. Olinger Strip is classified by the state's Department of Aviation as a privately owned, private use airport with at least three aircraft based at the airport. This designation allows the county to regulate heights of objects in the airplane approaches to the landing strip. Washington County approved these regulations in 2003, which also allowed for the Olinger Strip and like airports to expand by more than the previously allowed 20 percent.

Bagot was born at Rennes, France. He entered the Society of Jesus, 1 July 1611, taught belles-lettres for many years at various colleges in France, philosophy for five years, theology for thirteen years, and became theologian to the General of the Society. In 1647 he published the first part of his work Apologeticus Fidei titled Institutio Theologica de vera Religione In 1645 the second part, Demonstratio dogmatum Christianorum, appeared, and in 1646 Dissertationes theologicae on the Sacrament of Penance. In his Avis aux Catholiques, Bagot attacked the new doctrine on grace, directing against it also his Lettre sur la conformite de S. Augustin. In 1653 his Libertatis et gratiae defensio was published. In 1655 Rousse, Cur√© of Saint Roch (or Masure, the Cur√© of St. Paul's), published a little work titled De l'obligation des fid√®les de se confesser a leur cure, suivant le chapitre 21 du concile general de Latran. P√®re Bagot answered this in his D√©fense du droit √©piscopal et de la libert√© des fid√®les, which he afterwards translated into Latin. A controversy arose, in which various ecclesiastics, including Pierre de Marca, Archbishop of Toulouse, took sides against Bagot. The work was referred to the faculty of theology at Paris, which censured some of the propositions. Bagot, however, defended his doctrine before this assembly with the result that the censure was removed. he answered his opponents in the R√©ponse du P. Bagot. On his return from Rome he devoted the remaining years of his life to the congregation of the Blessed Virgin, and died superior of the professed house at Paris.

It serves as a monument to Charles Van Hise, a prominent Wisconsin geologist who studied the area extensively.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hp/register/viewSummary.asp?refnum=97001267 The rock was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. and Description The rock seen from below Van Hise Rock is made of Baraboo quartzite, a type of pink-purple quartzite found in south central Wisconsin. It is one of the best-exposed parts of the Baraboo Range, a ring of quartzite hills that passes through Columbia and Sauk Counties. The quartzite in the range was formed as sandstone during the Precambrian Supereon; then a greenschist phase changed it to quartzite. The monolith is located in a wayside on Wisconsin Highway 136, about 3/4 mile north of the intersection with Wisconsin Highway 154 near the village of Rock Springs. The wayside provides visitor access to the rock. History The rock is named in honor of Charles Van Hise, a prominent geologist who chaired the University of Wisconsin Department of Mineralogy and Geology. Among his significant accomplishments in geology and politics, Van Hise determined how the quartzite in the Baraboo Range had formed. Building on earlier discoveries that the quartzite formed in the Precambrian Era and had metamorphosed, Van Hise was able to determine the forces that deformed the rock; his discoveries helped form the key principles of structural geology. Van Hise also used his studies of the quartzite's conversion from sandstone to write the Treatise on Metamorphism in 1904, the first publication to describe the process of metamorphism in detail. University of Wisconsin geologists used Van Hise Rock to demonstrate the properties and principles which Van Hise discovered; the rock is still used in geological education and research.

The case was decided under the older Companies Act 1985. Facts Without reading it, Mr D'Jan signed a change to an insurance policy which was erroneously filled out by his insurance broker, a Mr Tarik Shenyuz. He did not read it before he signed, and it contained a mistake, which was that the answer 'no' was given to the question of whether in the past he had 'been director of any company which went into liquidation'. This meant the insurance company, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance plc, could refuse to pay up when a fire at the company‚Äôs Cornwall premises destroyed ¬£174,000 of stock. The company had gone into insolvent liquidation by the time Mr D'Jan realised that the form had been incorrectly completed. The liquidators sued Mr D'Jan to recoup the lost funds on behalf of the company's creditors (who together were owed ¬£500,000). They alleged both negligence and misfeasance under s 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Judgment Hoffmann LJ, sitting as a judge of first instance, held that failing even to read the form was negligent, even though it may be common practice, but that Mr D'Jan's liability should be reduced because as majority shareholder and debtor it was primarily his own money that he risked, rather than other people's. The duty of care owed by directors in section 214 Insolvency Act 1986 was an accurate statement of the common law duty also (now codified in Companies Act 2006 section 174). Because Mr D‚ÄôJan held 99 and his wife 1 out of the 100, Mr D'Jan pleaded that in accordance with the principle of the Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd,[1983] Ch 258 that shareholders all acting by consensus bind the company's actions, his actions were ratified by the company and he should not be liable. Hoffmann LJ held that actual ratification is required, not just a likelihood that shareholders would ratify. However owning 99 shares was relevant to the court‚Äôs exercise of discretion to relieve directors for breaches of duty under section 727 of the Companies Act 1985 (now section 1157 of the Companies Act 2006) because it ‚Äòmay be reasonable to take a risk in relation to your own money which would be unreasonable in relation to someone else‚Äôs.‚Äô His judgment went as follows.

He last played for F.C. Halifax Town. As a youngster, Walker represented England at youth and schoolboy level and signed professional forms with Nottingham Forest in September 1992. But he failed to break into the first-team with Forest and joined Scunthorpe United in March 1997. Walker was a regular with United until he moved to Lincoln City in July 2000, playing in the 1998‚Äì99 Football League Division Three play-off final win at Wembley Stadium against Leyton Orient. After two years with Lincoln, in which he was named Player of the Season for the 2000-01 season, financial difficulties due to the ITV Digitial collapse meant that Walker was released at the end of his contract. Walker joined Exeter City in August 2002, but his solitary season with the Grecians ended in relegation from the Football League. The same fate would befall his next club, Cambridge United in 2004‚Äì05. Walker achieved a possibly unique hat-trick of successive relegations out of the league by playing for York City on loan for two months in 2003‚Äì04 season. Walker joined Chester City ahead of the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, where he was to manage just 13 league starts. With six weeks of the season remaining Chester lay bottom of the League Two table and Walker seemed set for yet another relegation experience, but a late run of wins saved City from the drop. However, Walker was released in the summer of 2006 and joined Ilkeston Town. On 2 August 2008 he linked up with his former Ilkeston manager Nigel Jemson at F.C. Halifax Town debuting in their inaugural match, a 3‚Äì0 home defeat to Bamber Bridge on 16 August 2008. After starting Town's first seven league games, Walker found himself dropped to the substitutes bench and, after one further league appearance from the bench, he was released in November 2008.

At the highest peak in Hartley stand nine obelisks referred to as \\"Nine Standards\\". Nobody knows the true purpose of the \\"Nine Standards\\" although some believe that they were used to create a sense of a forthcoming army to scare the enemy forces. However, it is believed more heavily that they were placed as geographical aid to help outline the borders between the two neighbouring counties, Westmorland and Yorkshire. Hartley also is home to Hartley Castle. It was originally built as a \\"tower house circa 1353 and extended circa 1600\\" and then re- developed in the 18th century. The Castle was built at the southern point of Hartley. In the 1870s, Hartley was described as: :Hartley, a township in Kirkby-Stephen parish, Westmoreland; 1 mile SE of Kirkby-Stephen. Acres, 3, 350.

The township is mountainous; includes Hartley fell; and contains coal, lead, and copper = Brief History of Hartley = The history of Hartley changes in correlation with the power struggle between different parties for control over England. Sir Andrew de Harcala was given residence at Hartley Castle in the 13th century as he served Edward II and then was later pronounced Earl of Carlisle. However, when Robert the Bruce invaded the north of England, Sir Andrew de Harcala was executed on accounts of treason. After, the new owner of the Hartley Castle fortified the house later that century. However, Sir Andrew de Harcala was also given other pieces of estate including the Kings Watermill now known as Hartley Low Mill. As well as losing residence at Hartley Castle, Sir Andrew also lost the Kings Watermill as soon as he was executed. The Kings Watermill was then later sold to the Musgraves family. The Mill was repaired in 1754 by Sir Philip Musgrave and given a \\"new cog wheel and 'trunls', for ¬£1.14\\". In 1914, the Musgraves family sold Hartley Low mill to a James Cleasby and from then, the owners and tenants of Low Mill have changed throughout the 20th century. = Population of Hartley over time = The population of Hartley has remained rather consistent over time. Hartley is a very small parish and because of this, differences in population over time are difficult to notice. However, in 1891 it had a population of \\"183\\" people. This shows the greatest population change in the time span of 10 years (54 residents). Throughout the 20th century, the census data from the years recording the population of Hartley remained at a constant level which continued into the start of the 21st century. In 2011, Hartley had a population of \\"138\\". By analysing the population in the whole of the Eden district from the neighbourhood statistics website it shows that in Eden in 2011, there was a total population of \\"52,564\\". This shows that Hartley made up only 0.26% of the population of the Eden district in 2011. = Occupation Census in 1881 = The Census in 1881 helps show the different occupations that the population of Hartley, Westmorland had at the time. One of the most noticeable factors about the occupations in Hartley is the divide in work by gender. The majority of females in Hartley had unknown occupations or worked in domestic services. A domestic service can include being a maid or a cleaner. There was only one female that had a professional occupation however, this female also happened to be the only person in Hartley with a professional occupation. On the other hand, the males in Hartley had more specific occupations. The most popular occupation in Hartley in 1881 was one linked to agriculture, most likely farmers. This shows that agriculture was a big part of the culture of Hartley and its people. From looking at the types of occupations, males had an occupation that usually involved some type of labour whereas females either did not have an occupation or did not have occupation that involved hard labour. It is also evident to show that only three males either had an unknown occupation or didn't have a specific occupation. This was most likely due to males being seen in society as those to provide an income for their families whilst the females stayed at home and were expected to look after the children and their homes for their husbands. Although, at this time in history, there was gender inequality and men were usually employed. Whilst for women, it was very difficult for them to acquire a job as they were expected by society to not work and to be dependent on men. The Victoria and Albert Museum states that \\"Traditionally, women were defined physically and intellectually as the 'weaker' sex, in all ways subordinate to male authority. In private life women were subject to fathers, husbands, brothers even adult sons\\". This is ultimately down to the social views on what men and women should do in terms of occupations and the limits that women had in 1881. = Occupation Census in 2011 = Hartley had a population of \\"138\\" according to the 2011 census. The 2011 census data shows the different occupations that men and women had in Hartley 2011. One key feature shown in the 2011 occupation data of Hartley is the high number of men and women who have professional occupations. The highest number of occupations that women had were Professional occupations (10). Whereas, the most popular occupation for men in Hartley are Skilled trade occupations (13) closely followed by Managers, directors and senior officials (11). The most unpopular professions for both genders were Sales and Customer Service Occupations, Process, plant and machine operatives and Elementary occupations. One main difference between the occupation data from the 1881 census and the 2011 census is the increase in employed women. In 1881, only one woman was able to obtain a professional occupation in Hartley. Whereas, 130 years later, this number has increased to ten. The popularity in the different types of occupations has also changed from 1881. In 1881, popular occupations were professions that involved manual labour such as Agriculture. Nevertheless, in 2011 there is a greater popularity in more occupations that aren't as labour-intensive. For example, there is a larger section of the population of Hartley working in the service sector working as Managers, directors and senior officials.

It was formerly in the county of Westmorland. The place-name 'Crosby Garrett' is first attested in a document of 1200, where it appears as Crosseby, and in another of 1206, where it appears as Crossebi Gerard. The first name is Old Scandinavian Krossa-byr, meaning 'village or homestead with crosses'. 'Garrett' is the French personal name 'Gerard', which is ultimately of Germanic origin.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.132.

The helmet was sold to a private buyer at Christie's later that year for ¬£2.3 million. Description The parish contains no settlements of any size other than the village of Crosby Garrett, and much of the parish is on Crosby Garrett Fell to the south-west of the village. The Settle to Carlisle railway passes through the parish, at the southwestern edge of the village on the Crosby Garrett viaduct; the village once had a railway station, Crosby Garrett station, which closed in 1952. The parish church of St. Andrew has an Anglo-Saxon chancel, the remainder of the church dates between the 12th and 15th centuries. In 2010, a major restoration project was undertaken.

Her writing is significant as it recaps the views of the American Civil War from the point of a view of a woman living in one of the most frequently re-occupied towns of the conflict. She became known as one of the \\"Devil Diarists of Winchester.\\" Peake was born in 1822 in Alexandria, Virginia. She was the youngest of six children of Dr. Humphrey Peake and Annie Linton Lane. She married Angus William McDonald in 1847 in Hannibal, Missouri. The couple would have nine children.Descendants of William Peake . Cornelia was the second wife of McDonald, an 1817 graduate of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. valdosta.edu During the Civil War, her husband was away from Winchester serving as the colonel of the 7th Virginia Cavalry, leaving Cornelia to stay home with the children. (He would die in December 1864, leaving her a widow.)Find-a-Grave biography for Colonel McDonald, findagrave.com She kept a detailed diary during the Civil War, which was published in 1875, with a second edition in 1934. It was reprinted in 2003. She was buried beside her husband in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.Find-a-Grave biography of Cornelia McDonald, findagrave.com Influences on the Civil War Her diary is very beneficial in aiding research about women during the Civil War. In her diary she discusses the war, her feelings toward the war, her opinions on the issue of slavery and she gives insights into being a woman in the United States in the 1800s. Peake shows a devotion to her state, Virginia, not her country or even the Confederacy. She also describes her inner conflict of following her husband and their friends in their thoughts on slavery or to follow her own instincts about slavery being outdated and wrong. She confesses the need for some change in the South, but she also expresses fears about losing her way of life. Cornelia Peake McDonald's diary is very insightful about a woman's role during the Civil War and the conflicts women were facing during that time. It is crucial to recognize that the Women's Right's Movement was in its beginning stages while she was writing her diary. Many women during this time found the war to be liberating. Change was taking place in both the South and the North, Blacks were gaining freedom and women were left to care for finances, farms and families while men went to war and sometimes never returned. These new responsibilities linked with the new independence movement pushed women to question their ideas and stations in life. In Cornelia Peake McDonald's diary, a perfect example of this is seen, she starts to question herself and her ideas. Cornelia Peake McDonald is a good example of how women began to progress starting during the Civil War.

Construction and opening The station was built on the Midland Railway's New Mills and Heaton Mersey Line (the so-called \\"Disley cut off\\" line) to avoid the congestion and junctions of New Mills, Marple, Romiley and Stockport Tiviot Dale and difficult profile of the existing line, slowing down London St Pancras to Manchester Central express trains via the Manchester South District Line. On 1 October 1901, the initial section from Heaton Mersey to Cheadle Heath opened, with a service of passenger trains to Manchester Central. The line through Disley tunnel to New Mills South Junction was opened on 1 July 1902, enabling through services to Derby and other stations. Initially named Cheadle Heath, from 1 May 1902 to 1 October 1908 the name was Cheadle Heath for Stockport, from 1 October 1908 until 14 June 1965 Cheadle Heath Stockport, and from that date until closure the station reverted to its original name. Train services Local trains served Manchester Central and intermediate stations. The Midland Pullman operated a regular morning express service between Manchester Central and London St Pancras, with Cheadle Heath as its only stop before running non-stop to London. The station remained open to passengers until 2 January 1967 and to freight traffic until 1 July 1968. Current use of the station site and railway line By 2009 most of the station's site has now been occupied by a Morrison's supermarket and car park, however a single track remains and is still used by freight trains, mostly carrying limestone from quarries near Buxton in the Peak District to chemical factories near Northwich in Cheshire. The two railway bridges across the River Mersey at Cheadle Heath North junction have been demolished. Three of the four bridge heads remain. One of them is readily accessible to walkers.

The beverage has antioxidant effects because of the flavonoids.\\"Contenido de glic√≥sidos de flavonoides en frutos inmaduros en Citrus aurantium y Citrus sinensis\\" on Informaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica n¬∞ 13, edited by C.I.T. of Argentina - ISSN 0716-8756 Its name was taken from the Greek myth of Hesperides.  History  The Hesperidina label (1866) was printed in the US to avoid falsifications. This alcoholic drink was invented in 1864 by an American immigrant, Melville Sewell Bagley, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bagley was a native of the state of Maine. He had been involved in the dry goods business in New Orleans before the outbreak of the American Civil War. After the outbreak he emigrated to Buenos Aires where he worked at \\"La Estrella\\" pharmacy, located on Defensa and Alsina streets. Bagley experimented with different formulas to create a digestive beverage using oranges as the main ingredient.Norteamericanos en la Argentina by Lucio P√©rez Calvo, 2007 - Hesperidina would be born from those tests. Prior to the official launch of his drink, Bagley held an extensive publicity campaign using posters spread throughout Buenos Aires. Those posters had only the single, cryptic word \\"Hesperidina\\" without images or further explanations. The poster campaign lasted three months until Hesperidina was finally launched on December 24, 1864, with an advertisement published in La Tribuna newspaper. The advertisement touted Hesperidina as a \\"stomach digestive, prepared with bitter oranges.\\" The immediate success of the ap√©ritif led to imitators and counterfeiting of the product. Alarmed by this development, Bagley convinced the president of Argentina, Nicol√°s Avellaneda, to create a patent and trademark office in 1876 in order to protect his product. Hesperidina was the first product to register as a trademark in Argentina on October 27., Revoluci√≥n Industrial y Equipamiento Urbano by Jorge Gazaneo & Mabel Scarone - Instituto de Arte Americano e Investigaciones Est√©ticas, 1967 Soon after, Bagley had Hesperidina labels printed at the New York Bank Note Company in order to strengthen controls over the product. During the Triple Alliance War (1864‚Äì1870) Hesperidina was distributed among Argentine soldiers \\"to revitalize the wounded\\" because of its therapeutic effects on stomach problems associated with drinking non-potable water. Beverages, indeed, opened the door to a whole new sector of advertisement pioneered by the Hesperidina campaign and the arrival to the country of worldwide \\"food and beverage\\" names such as Real Hollands, Nestl√©, Domecq and Bols among others. In popular culture The Hesperidina is mentioned in three short stories by Julio Cort√°zar: Casa Tomada, T√≠a en Apuros and Circe. Another writer, Juan Carlos Casas, included Hesperidina in his book Fraile Muerto.Fraile muerto by Juan C. Casas, Editorial Stokcero, 2002, , Hesperidina also appeared in the short story Perdido by Haroldo Conti.Haroldo Conti bio Tango singer Roberto Goyeneche described Hesperidina as his favorite beverage, which he used to drink at \\"La Sirena\\", a bar in Saavedra, Buenos Aires.

The case is globally cited for its definition of a fiduciary and the circumstances in which a fiduciary relationship arises. Facts Mr Mothew was a solicitor who had acted for both borrower and lender in a mortgage transaction relating to the purchase of a residential property. It was alleged that he negligently told the building society that there was no second charge on the house when the mortgage agreement was signed. At the time of reporting to the building society and requesting its funding, unbeknown to Mr Mothew, the borrower had a relatively small bank overdraft facility limited to ¬£2,000. After completion of the purchase and mortgage (at which time the lender's funds were applied to the transaction) but before the transactions were registered at Land Registry Mr Mothew was approached by the borrower's bankers [Barclays] to say that they were granting a second mortgage facility to the borrower and seeking that their second charge be registered at Land Registry. The second charge documentation had been prepared and executed by the borrower at the bank's premises. By registering the second charge documentation contemporaneously with the purchase and (first) mortgage there was a waiver of fees payable to the Land Registry thereby saving expense for the borrower than if the second charge had been registered separately later. The Cheshunt Building Society were asked by Mr Mothew to consent to registration of the second charge which they did and they were also given formal notice of the second charge which they acknowledged. Mr Mothew delayed sending the application to the registry whilst the lender's consent was being obtained since it was also required to be lodged at the Land Registry. At the time of their default the borrower's overdraft facility had risen from ¬£2,000 to ¬£3,350. The housing market collapsed, and the homeowners (having lost their employment in the recession) defaulted on their mortgage with the building society. To realise their money, the building society had the property sold off for ¬£53,000 in February 1991, a considerable time after they had taken possession of it. The lender claimed that if it had known of the borrower's overdraft facility, it would not have granted its mortgage to the borrower. They sued Mothew for the sum they lent (¬£59,000) less the proceeds of the sale. Mothew argued that Bristol and West had been aware of the second charge and even if it had not known, it would still have proceeded with the transaction and suffered the same loss, because in 1988 when the transaction was going through, the market was buoyant and the extent of the borrower's overdraft facility was commonplace. This would mean no damages would be recoverable at common law, for there would be no causal connection with Mothew's (alleged) negligence and the building society's loss. At first instance he was unsuccessful. However his professional indemnity insurers took the matter to the Court of Appeal where three judges unanimously supported Mr Mothew (see Judgment below) and the case was referred back, ultimately resulting in a settlement whereby no penalty or payment was required to be paid by Mr Mothew or his insurers. Bristol and West ended up having to make a contribution in the region of eighty thousand pounds (¬£80,000) to the costs of Mr Mothew's indemnity insurers. This case is important because the Court of Appeal set out authority (a case with establishing a precedent) for a solicitors \\"fiduciary duty\\" to a lender in the application of funds drawn down by the solicitor irrespective of negligence being established. It has never in this particular case established any negligence, default or breach of duty of care by Mr. Mothew. Judgment Millett LJ allowed Mothew's appeal, and held that a causal link needed to be established. Just because the solicitor himself had fiduciary duties to his clients, that did not mean that every breach of duty of care was a breach of a fiduciary duty. When considering breaches of trust, causation need not be demonstrated, since these are concerned with acts of bad faith or breaches of the duty of loyalty that result in restitutionary damages. The building society had been fully informed and had consented to Mothew's course of action, which broke the causal link. Also, a claim for breach of trust was not accepted, because Mothew's misrepresentations did not lead him outside his authority to apply the mortgage money. At p. 16-18 Millett LJ gave a summary of the relevant law. Staughton LJ and Otton LJ agreed.

It was published in 1945 by Methuen Plot summary Miss Cornwallis is mistress of the fifth form. Hilary Wentworth is a calm and dignified head-girl. Being in the fifth form means quite a lot of changes ‚Äì for example, the girls have got studies of their own now, instead of common rooms and dormitories, the first ‚Äì and second-formers have got to work for them. For some reason, Mirabel has been made games captain for the school, and Gladys vice captain. It is not explained why or how Mirabel has developed such good sporting abilities, nor is it explained why she is no longer musical. In her first term at St Clare's she was written as a very musical girl, talented at the piano and the violin. Two girls use their new power badly - Angela Favorleigh takes advantage of her prettiness and charm and turns the younger girls into willing slaves and so does Mirabel, who is games captain. Some room is made for the second-form - Antoinette, Claudine's little sister, has come to St. Clare's, too, and she proves to be as irrepressible as Claudine. There are three new girls in the fifth form and all of them are unpopular ‚Äì Anne-Marie, who fancies herself a poet, Felicity Ray, a musical genius, and Alma, a fat girl who suffers from what nowadays would be called an eating disorder. Felicity's parents are very ambitious and, in spite of Miss Theobald's warnings, push their daughter too hard ‚Äì she is to take a very difficult musical exam and works herself too hard.

It is a romantic drama set against the background of the French Foreign Legion, and the film was an example of poetic realism in the French cinema. The title Le Grand Jeu refers to the practice of reading the cards. Blanche asks whether her client wants the 'full works', the whole story: \\"Alors... je te fais le grand jeu?\\" Plot Pierre Martel (Pierre Richard-Willm), a young Parisian businessman, is brought to financial ruin and disgrace through the extravagant lifestyle that he pursues with his lover Florence (Marie Bell). Forced to leave the country, he joins the Foreign Legion, as Pierre Muller, and seeks to submerge his own despair in a new life in North Africa alongside other unhappy refugees such as the Russian Nicolas (Georges Pito√´ff). When not on campaign, they lodge in a cheap hotel run by the greedy and lecherous Cl√©ment (Charles Vanel) and his sadly stoical wife Blanche (Fran√ßoise Rosay), who passes the time by reading the cards to tell her customers their fortunes. When Pierre encounters Irma (Marie Bell) working in a local bar as a singer and a prostitute, he finds her almost identical to his former lover Florence, except for her voice and the colour of her hair. Irma is vague about her past and Pierre becomes ever more obsessed with the apparent reincarnation of his old love. They live together at the hotel, and when Cl√©ment forces himself on Irma, Pierre kills him in a struggle; Blanche makes it appear to be an accident. When Pierre's term of service finishes, he and Irma plan a new life together back in France where he has now inherited some money. But on the eve of their embarkation in Casablanca, Pierre happens to meet again the real Florence, now mistress to a wealthy Arab, and his feelings for Irma are shattered. Having duped Irma into returning to France alone, he re-enlists in the Legion. Blanche's cards foretell a brave death for him in his next campaign. Production Jacques Feyder had been working in Hollywood since 1929. However, in 1932, when he and MGM failed to reach an agreement on any new projects, he returned to France. One of his last unrealized projects in Hollywood had been to direct Greta Garbo in an adaptation of Pirandello's Come tu mi vuoi (As You Desire Me), in which he proposed to give a different voice to Garbo for part of her role. He carried this same idea into the scenario for Le Grand Jeu, in which two different roles would be played by the same actress, but with one of them dubbed by a different voice to create a disconcerting dramatic effect.Jean-Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans d'ann√©es trente. (Paris, Stock, 1983), p.173-174. Marie Bell's own voice was used in the role of Florence, but Claude Marcy dubbed her voice in the character of Irma. (Marcy also regularly dubbed the dialogue of Greta Garbo for French distribution of her films.)Jacques Feyder; sous la direction de Jean A. Gili et Michel Marie. Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 1998. p.233. (1895, octobre 1998, num√©ro hors s√©rie). With Charles Spaak as his scenarist, Feyder developed a romantic drama set in the colonial world of French North Africa, which he had previously explored in his silent film L'Atlantide. For the central character of Pierre, Feyder had originally wanted Charles Boyer, but after a disagreement between them he chose the popular film and theatre actor Pierre Richard-Willm. The supporting cast included Charles Vanel and Feyder's wife Fran√ßoise Rosay. Filming took place in the autumn of 1933, and the film was released in May 1934. In addition to the atmospheric set designs of Lazare Meerson, Feyder wanted to film some scenes on location. When however he took his cast and crew to Morocco, he failed to obtain the cooperation of the Legion for his story, and he was obliged to film some scenes of legionnaires at work and on the march in real life as though he were making a documentary.Notes accompanying Path√© Classique DVD released in 2007. One of the assistant directors on this film (and others by Feyder) was Marcel Carn√©, some of whose later films (Le Quai des brumes, Le jour se l√®ve) would create a similar mood of romantic fatalism (and poetic realism). Reception On its release in France, the film enjoyed considerable success, and was rated one of the best French films of 1934 by both the public and the press. In addition to its superior production values, there was much interest in the technical device of the double role with a dubbed voice.e.g. Alexandre Arnoux, Du muet au parlant, (Paris, La Nouvelle Edition, 1946). A contemporary film historian wrote: \\"Le Grand Jeu is one of the few films to have made use of a new idea since talkies came in. This might not have been sufficient to hold our attention but for a certain vulgar brutality which sustained the interest of the plot. Though the film was overromantic, we had the impression of seeing real people. ...There is a rare quality of truthfulness which always saves Feyder, and his rather vulgar characters exude a strange atmosphere of destiny and death.\\" The same author concluded that \\"out of this rather absurd plot, Feyder made a profoundly human film\\".Maurice Bard√®che and Robert Brasillach, History of the Film; trans. by Iris Barry. (London, Allen & Unwin, 1938) p.336. Critics have subsequently tended to find weaknesses in the acting of the two principals, now overshadowed by the supporting contributions of the better-known Charles Vanel and Fran√ßoise Rosay, but the vivid portrayal of a colonial garrison has continued to impress.Georges Sadoul, Dictionnaire des films, (Paris, Seuil, 1983), p.131.) Influence Le Grand Jeu contributed to the series of films which used the French Foreign Legion as a colourful background. It was followed in 1935 by Julien Duvivier's La Bandera, also scripted by Charles Spaak, though actually about the Spanish Foreign Legion. Other French films with similar background were Un de la l√©gion (1936, dir.Christian-Jaque - a comedy with Fernandel) and Les Hommes sans nom (1937, dir.Jean Vall√©e). Meanwhile, American cinema showed a continuing interest in the Foreign Legion with remakes of Beau Geste and Under Two Flags, among many others. Le Grand Jeu was also one of the films which defined a characteristic mood of romantic despair in the French cinema of the 1930s, a mood shared by films such as P√©p√© le Moko, H√¥tel du Nord, Le Quai des brumes, and Le jour se l√®ve. Although there is no reason to claim a connection, the theme of a man re-inventing a new lover in the image of his old one was later explored by Alfred Hitchcock in Vertigo. A 1954 remake of Le Grand Jeu was directed by Robert Siodmak and featured Gina Lollobrigida and Arletty. It was released in the USA as Flesh and the Woman and in the UK as The Card of Fate.

It is one of the oldest Ganesha temples in the state. Five gods - Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Sun and Ganesha - are worshiped as one deity in a single Garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum there.  Multiple deities  Five gods are worshiped as one deity there. There is no pahada in the temple for this reason. Normally, Hindu temples close after pahada, which is sleeping time for the Gods. Since Shiva and Vishnu are worshiped in a single sanctum sanctorum, leaves of both Bilva (Aegle marmelos) and Tulasi (Holy Basil) are used in prasadam. Anna (rice) prasadam is offered instead of Batula Bhoga.Kadambini Magazine Edition September 2013  Location  The Mahavinayak Temple is located in Chandikhole, in Jajpur district. The first adjoining foothill base, hosts the temple of Goddess Chandi, and in the second foothill base is the temple of Mahavinayak. Both have perennial springs (named Golden Spring) with pucca swimming ponds for bathing. In the middle of the hill, just above the Mahavinayak temple, is another temple dedicated to Maa Banadurga.  Legends  The Mahavinayak temple is a place of mythological and historical importance. This temple was constructed by the kings of the Keshari Dynasty of Odisha during the 12th century. Rati Devi, the wife of Kamadev, is worshiped there for her devotion that led to the release of her husband from the curse of Lord Shiva. While she was praying to Lord Ganesh, five hands simultaneously stretched out towards her to receive her offering, putting her in a dilemma. She then prayed to Bramha who clarified that the five Gods, Ganesh, Sun, Vishnu, Shiva and Durga, had been pleased with her prayer and simultaneously stretched their hands to receive her offering. Kamadev was released thereafter, and that day a large granite stone emerged from the earth, containing the divine power of the five Gods. This place is also related to Mahabharat legends. The Baruna hill area was the capital of Yudhisthira. From this place, he left for heaven by handing the royal charges of his empire to a teli (an oilman whom he saw first before dawn) who later became the king. His palace was named as Teligarh and the remains of his palace can still be seen on the opposite side of the temple. During the Mahabharat battle, mother Kunti also offered Golden Champa flower to Lord Shiva from this place for the victory of her sons. It is also said that the detached head of Lord Ganesha fell at this location.  Festivals  Festivals such as Shiva Ratri, Makar Sankranti, and Raja are celebrated here. Shiva Ratri is celebrated for five days with Yagna and Homa every year. People visit each Monday. In the month of Shravana, Shiva devotees offer holy river water to fulfill their wishes.  Tourism  This temple plays a role in Odisha tourism, particularly attracting worshipers of Shiva. It is a picnic spot for trekkers and religious pilgrims, with its densely wooded hills. Chandi temple can be reached via a forest route from Mahavinayak temple. Its natural environment attracts tourists during winter and summer season. Lodging and temple boarding facilities are available for pilgrims to use. These facilities are maintained by the Endowment Commissioner of Odisha with one Trustee board.

He was the principal bassoonist in the London Symphony Orchestra (1958‚Äì1965), and in the BBC Symphony Orchestra (1965‚Äì1982), playing under such conductors as Cantelli, Toscanini, Furtw√§ngler, Monteux, Karajan, Klemperer and Boulez.William Waterhouse Guild Music profile 2000 The composer and cellist Graham Waterhouse is his son. William Waterhouse died in 2007 in Florence. Chamber musician William Waterhouse was a member of the Melos Ensemble from 1959 and participated with the group in the premiere of the War Requiem by Benjamin Britten, conducted by the composer. He recorded all the wind chamber music by Beethoven, and works by Nielsen, Jan√°ƒçek, Poulenc, Schubert and Jean Fran√ßaix with the ensemble. He wrote in 1995: \\"It was the remarkable rapport between this pair of lower strings\\" (i.e. Terence Weil and Cecil Aronowitz) \\"which remained constant throughout a succession of distinguished leaders, that gave a special distinction to this outstanding ensemble.\\"Obituary Terence Weil, The Independent, William Waterhouse, 9 March 1995 He recorded with the Melos Ensemble, its principal players Richard Adeney and William Bennett (flute), Gervase de Peyer and Keith Puddy (clarinet), Stephen Trier (bass clarinet), Peter Graeme and Sarah Barrington (oboe), Neill Sanders and James Buck (horn), Edgar Williams (bassoon), Emanuel Hurwitz and Ivor McMahon (violin), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Terence Weil (cello), Adrian Beers (double bass), Lamar Crowson (piano):Melos Ensemble ‚Äì Music among Friends, EMI * Beethoven: ** Quintet for piano and winds, Op. 16 ** March for Sextet in B flat major, WoO 29 ** Rondino in E flat major, WoO 25 ** Septet ** Octet ** Duo No. 1 in C major, WoO 27 * Schubert: Octet * Franz Berwald: Septet * Carl Nielsen: Wind Quintet * Jan√°ƒçek: Ml√°d√≠, Concertino * Francis Poulenc: Trio for Oboe, Bassoon & Piano, Sonata for Clarinet & Bassoon * Jean Fran√ßaix: Divertissement for Oboe, Clarinet and Bassoon, Divertissement for Bassoon and String Quintet (dedicated to him) * Nikos Skalkottas: Octet * Richard Rodney Bennett: Calendar * Gordon Crosse: Concerto Da Camera * Harrison Birtwistle: Tragoedia * Peter Maxwell Davies: Leopardi Fragments In 1974 he recorded Stockhausen's Adieu with the London Sinfonietta: Sebastian Bell (flute), Janet Craxton (oboe), Antony Pay (clarinet) and John Butterworth (horn), conducted by the composer.

Among the rare music he rediscovered is a sonata for bassoon and piano by Anton Liste (1772‚Äì1832) that he recorded in 1998 with William Fong.Bassoon & Piano Sonatas by Anton Liste Guildmusic, German/English, quote: It is a rare opportunity to hear the masterly artistry of William Waterhouse, whose recordings are, sadly, too few, especially as a soloist. No other bassoonist in the world plays like Bill. His phrasing ability, ease of performance, style, and fabulous technique make him a \\"bassoonist's bassoonist\\". Lyndesay G. Langwill, who had published his Index of Musical Wind-Instrument Makers in book form from 1960 in six editions, had designated William Waterhouse as his successor and had left him his archive of correspondence and books, before he died in 1983. After ten years of research The New Langwill Index: A dictionary of musical wind- instrument makers and inventors was published. This important work of reference was awarded the C.B. Oldman prize in 1995.C.B. Oldman Prize Posthumously he received the Curt Sachs Award of the American Musical Instrument Society on 31 May 2008.American Musical Instrument Society 2008 Juror of international competitions He served on the jury of the ARD Musikwettbewerb in Munich in 1965, 1975, 1984 and 1990, as well as in Prague, Eindhoven, Markneukirchen, Potsdam and Victoria BC. Double Reed Society William Waterhouse was one of the co-founders of the British Double Reed Society in 1988 and was a member of the Society's Committee until his death in 2007. The IDRS 2009, the annual conference of the International Double Reed Society in Birmingham, was dedicated to him and Evelyn Barbirolli. Music dedicated to William Waterhouse Gordon Jacob dedicated to him the Suite for bassoon and string quartet, first performed at the Cheltenham Festival on 8 July 1969 together with Emanuel Hurwitz, Ivor McMahon, Cecil Aronowitz and Terence Weil,Gordon Jacob Suite and the Partita for solo bassoon which Waterhouse premiered on 27 October 1977 in Wigmore Hall.Gordon Jacob Partita Jean Fran√ßaix dedicated his 1942 Divertissement for bassoon and string quintet (or orchestra) to him when it was published in 1968,Divertissement Schott Music also in 1994 his Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano.Trio Schott Music Victor Bruns dedicated his Trio op. 97 f√ºr Fagottino, Fagott und Kontrafagott to William Waterhouse. Stanley Weiner wrote a Sonata for Bassoon Solo op. 32.Stanley Weiner Sonata Graham Waterhouse dedicated Mouvements d'Harmonie and Hexenreigen to him and composed Phoenix Arising for bassoon and piano and Epitaphium as a tribute to his father's memory. In 2008 he composed the bassoon quartet Bright Angel, in memory of a hike with his father through the Grand Canyon. The Proud Bassoon William Waterhouse was celebrated in his 80th birthyear on 16 April 2011 in a Memorial Concert The Proud Bassoon in Wigmore Hall. Players included his three children, Gervase de Peyer and Timothy Brown as former members of the Melos Ensemble, players who succeeded him such as Roger Birnstingl (Orchestre de la Suisse Romande) and Julie Price (BBC Symphony Orchestra), bassoonists from around the world, such as Jim Kopp, Lyndon Watts and Takashi Yamakami, his students and a bassoon quartet from the RNCM, led by Stefano Canuti. All the music played related to him, his own arrangement of Giovanni Gabrieli's Sonata Pian' e Forte for two bassoon choirs, music dedicated to him, such as Gordon Jacob's Suite and the Divertissement of Jean Francaix, and music composed in his memory, his son's Bright Angel and Epitaphium. The concert ended with the final movement from Schubert's Octet, which he had often played and twice recorded with the Melos Ensemble. The program book includes a section of memories, titled \\"recollected in tranquility, a celebration\\", including a contribution of Karlheinz Stockhausen who wrote in 2007: > Not only in rehearsal, but also in many hours before and after rehearsals > and recordings, and during our trips with the ensemble, I had the pleasure > and privilege of sharing with William Waterhouse his rich cultural knowledge > and enthusiasm.

A resistance group or network was an organization created for a specific military purpose (intelligence, sabotage, helping prisoners of war escape and preventing shot-down pilots from falling into the hands of the Germans). In contrast, the main goal of a resistance movement was to educate and organize the population. The majority of resistance movements in France were unified after Jean Moulin's formation of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR) in May 1943. CNR was coordinated with the French Forces of the Interior under the authority of the Free French Generals Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle and their body, the Comit√© Fran√ßais de Lib√©ration Nationale (CFLN).

The organisation had a particularly-strong presence in the Vercors, Lyon and Massif central d√©partements of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. *The Mouvements Unis de la R√©sistance (MUR) was formed in January 1943 as the civilian branch of the Arm√©e Secr√®te. *The Mouvement de Lib√©ration Nationale (MLN) was formed in early 1944 to combine the MUR of the Southern Zone with several movements in the Northern Zone. Many of the volunteers involved in the MLN went on to found the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance. * The Bataillons de la Jeunesse militant communist youth movement was incorporated into the Francs- Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). Ultimately, unification took place from late 1943 to early 1944 when the Arm√©e Secr√®te, the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans and other organisations gave birth to the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Other movements *The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British military organisation that directed from London. It parachuted more than four hundred agents into Occupied France to establish escape routes, co-ordinate acts of sabotage, set up radio communications and supply materials and armaments for French groups. *The American OSS and the SOE contributed Jedburgh teams in 1944 to aid the resistance and arrange air supply of equipment. *D√©fense de la France was a resistance group in the Northern zone that was centred on the distribution of a clandestine newspaper, whose circulation had reached 450,000 by January 1944. *The Groupe du mus√©e de l'Homme was formed by Parisian academics and intellectuals in 1940 after General Charles de Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June. It distributed clandestine newspapers but with a more patriotic and conservative position than others. It also transmitted political and military information to Britain and helped to hide escaped Allied prisoners-of-wars. Vichy agents eventually infiltrated the group, and many members were arrested and later executed. *The Noyautage des administrations publiques (NAP) was a resistance organisation launched in 1942 with the mission of infiltrating the administration of the Vichy regime.

The terminology was established by the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA), under accreditation from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Addendum Principal dimensions The addendum is the height by which a tooth of a gear projects beyond (outside for external, or inside for internal) the standard pitch circle or pitch line; also, the radial distance between the pitch diameter and the outside diameter. Addendum angle Addendum angle in a bevel gear, is the angle between face cone and pitch cone. Addendum circle Internal gear diameters Root circle The addendum circle coincides with the tops of the teeth of a gear and is concentric with the standard (reference) pitch circle and radially distant from it by the amount of the addendum. For external gears, the addendum circle lies on the outside cylinder while on internal gears the addendum circle lies on the internal cylinder. Pressure angleApex to back Apex to back, in a bevel gear or hypoid gear, is the distance in the direction of the axis from the apex of the pitch cone to a locating surface at the back of the blank. Back angle The back angle of a bevel gear is the angle between an element of the back cone and a plane of rotation, and usually is equal to the pitch angle. Back cone Principal dimensions The back cone of a bevel or hypoid gear is an imaginary cone tangent to the outer ends of the teeth, with its elements perpendicular to those of the pitch cone. The surface of the gear blank at the outer ends of the teeth is customarily formed to such a back cone. Back cone distance Back cone distance in a bevel gear is the distance along an element of the back cone from its apex to the pitch cone. Backlash In mechanical engineering, backlash is the striking back of connected wheels in a piece of mechanism when pressure is applied. Another source defines it as the maximum distance through which one part of something can be moved without moving a connected part. It is also called lash or play. In the context of gears, backlash is clearance between mating components, or the amount of lost motion due to clearance or slackness when movement is reversed and contact is re-established. In a pair of gears, backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth. Backlash is unavoidable for nearly all reversing mechanical couplings, although its effects can be negated. Depending on the application it may or may not be desirable. Reasons for requiring backlash include allowing for lubrication and thermal expansion, and to prevent jamming. Backlash may also result from manufacturing errors and deflection under load. Base circle Involute teeth The base circle of an involute gear is the circle from which involute tooth profiles are derived. Base cylinder Base cylinder The base cylinder corresponds to the base circle, and is the cylinder from which involute tooth surfaces are developed. Base diameter Base diameter The base diameter of an involute gear is the diameter of the base circle. Bevel gearBull gear The term bull gear is used to refer to the larger of two spur gears that are in engagement in any machine. The smaller gear is usually referred to as a pinion. Center distance Center distance Center distance (operating) is the shortest distance between non-intersecting axes. It is measured along the mutual perpendicular to the axes, called the line of centers. It applies to spur gears, parallel axis or crossed axis helical gears, and worm gearing. Central plane Central plane The central plane of a worm gear is perpendicular to the gear axis and contains the common perpendicular of the gear and worm axes. In the usual case with axes at right angles, it contains the worm axis.  Circular Pitch  The Circular Pitch defines the width of one tooth and one gap measured on an arc on the pitch circle; in other words, this is the distance on the pitch circle from a point on one tooth to the corresponding point on the adjacent tooth. This is equal to œÄ divided by the Diametral Pitch. CP = Circular Pitch in inches DP = Diametral Pitch CP = 3.141 / DP Machinery's Handbook Twenty-Fifth Edition, by Erik Oberg, Franklin D. Jones, Holbrook L. Horton, and Henry H Ryffle, 1996, Industrial Press Inc. Composite action test Schematic of the composite action test The composite action test (double flank) is a method of inspection in which the work gear is rolled in tight double flank contact with a master gear or a specified gear, in order to determine (radial) composite variations (deviations). The composite action test must be made on a variable center distance composite action test device. and this is composite action test for double flank Cone distance Cone distance Cone distance in a bevel gear is the general term for the distance along an element of the pitch cone from the apex to any given position in the teeth. Outer cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the outer ends of the teeth. When not otherwise specified, the short term cone distance is understood to be outer cone distance. Mean cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the middle of the face width. Inner cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the inner ends of the teeth. Conjugate gears Conjugate gears transmit uniform rotary motion from one shaft to another by means of gear teeth. The normals to the profiles of these teeth, at all points of contact, must pass through a fixed point in the common centerline of the two shafts. Usually conjugate gear tooth is made to suit the profile of other gear which is not made based on standard practice. Crossed helical gear A crossed helical gear is a gear that operate on non- intersecting, non-parallel axes. The term crossed helical gears has superseded the term spiral gears. There is theoretically point contact between the teeth at any instant. They have teeth of the same or different helix angles, of the same or opposite hand. A combination of spur and helical or other types can operate on crossed axes. Crossing point The crossing point is the point of intersection of bevel gear axes; also the apparent point of intersection of the axes in hypoid gears, crossed helical gears, worm gears, and offset face gears, when projected to a plane parallel to both axes. Crown circle The crown circle in a bevel or hypoid gear is the circle of intersection of the back cone and face cone. Crowned teeth Crowned gear Crowned teeth have surfaces modified in the lengthwise direction to produce localized contact or to prevent contact at their ends.  Diametral Pitch  The Diametral Pitch (DP) is the number of teeth per inch of diameter of the pitch circle. The units of DP are inverse inches (1/in).Machinery's Handbook Twenty-Fifth Edition, by Erik Oberg, Franklin D. Jones, Holbrook L. Horton, and Henry H Ryffle, 1996, Industrial Press Inc. DP = Diametral Pitch PD = Pitch Circle Diameter in inches CP = Circular Pitch in inches n = Number of Teeth DP = n / PD The Diametral Pitch (DP) is equal to œÄ divided by the Circular Pitch (CP). DP = 3.1416 / CP Dedendum angle Dedendum angle in a bevel gear, is the angle between elements of the root cone and pitch cone. Equivalent pitch radius Back cone equivalent Equivalent pitch radius is the radius of the pitch circle in a cross section of gear teeth in any plane other than a plane of rotation. It is properly the radius of curvature of the pitch surface in the given cross section. Examples of such sections are the transverse section of bevel gear teeth and the normal section of helical teeth. Face (tip) angle Face (tip) angle in a bevel or hypoid gear, is the angle between an element of the face cone and its axis. Face cone The face cone, also known as the tip cone is the imaginary surface that coincides with the tops of the teeth of a bevel or hypoid gear. Face gear Face worm gear A face gear set typically consists of a disk-shaped gear, grooved on at least one face, in combination with a spur, helical, or conical pinion. A face gear has a planar pitch surface and a planar root surface, both of which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation. It can also be referred to as a face wheel, crown gear, crown wheel, contrate gear or contrate wheel. Face width Face width The face width of a gear is the length of teeth in an axial plane. For double helical, it does not include the gap. Total face width is the actual dimension of a gear blank including the portion that exceeds the effective face width, or as in double helical gears where the total face width includes any distance or gap separating right hand and left hand helices. For a cylindrical gear, effective face width is the portion that contacts the mating teeth. One member of a pair of gears may engage only a portion of its mate. For a bevel gear, different definitions for effective face width are applicable. Form diameter Form diameter Form diameter is the diameter of a circle at which the trochoid (fillet curve) produced by the tooling intersects, or joins, the involute or specified profile. Although these terms are not preferred, it is also known as the true involute form diameter (TIF), start of involute diameter (SOI), or when undercut exists, as the undercut diameter. This diameter cannot be less than the base circle diameter. Front angle The front angle, in a bevel gear, denotes the angle between an element of the front cone and a plane of rotation, and usually equals the pitch angle. Front cone The front cone of a hypoid or bevel gear is an imaginary cone tangent to the inner ends of the teeth, with its elements perpendicular to those of the pitch cone. The surface of the gear blank at the inner ends of the teeth is customarily formed to such a front cone, but sometimes may be a plane on a pinion or a cylinder in a nearly flat gear. Gear center A gear center is the center of the pitch circle. Gear range The gear range is difference between the highest and lowest gear ratios and may be expressed as a percentage (e.g., 500%) or as a ratio (e.g., 5:1). Heel Heel and toe The heel of a tooth on a bevel gear or pinion is the portion of the tooth surface near its outer end. The toe of a tooth on a bevel gear or pinion is the portion of the tooth surface near its inner end. Helical rack A helical rack has a planar pitch surface and teeth that are oblique to the direction of motion. Helix angle Helix angle is the angle between the helical tooth face and an equivalent spur tooth face. For the same lead, the helix angle is greater for larger gear diameters. It is understood to be measured at the standard pitch diameter unless otherwise specified. Herringbone gearHobbing Hobbing is a machining process for making gears, splines, and sprockets using a cylindrical tool with helical cutting teeth known as a hob. Index deviation The displacement of any tooth flank from its theoretical position, relative to a datum tooth flank. Distinction is made as to the direction and algebraic sign of this reading. A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was nearer to the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), than the theoretical position would be considered a minus (-) deviation. A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was farther from the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction, than the theoretical position would be considered a plus (+) deviation. The direction of tolerancing for index deviation along the arc of the tolerance diameter circle within the transverse plane. Pitch Deviations Inside cylinder Diameters, Internal Gear The inside cylinder is the surface that coincides with the tops of the teeth of an internal cylindrical gear. Inside diameter Internal gear diameters Inside diameter is the diameter of the addendum circle of an internal gear, this is also known as minor diameter. Involute gearInvolute polar angle Involute polar angle Expressed as Œ∏, the involute polar angle is the angle between a radius vector to a point, P, on an involute curve and a radial line to the intersection, A, of the curve with the base circle. Involute roll angle Involute roll angle Expressed as Œµ, the involute roll angle is the angle whose arc on the base circle of radius unity equals the tangent of the pressure angle at a selected point on the involute. Involute teeth Involute teeth Involute teeth of spur gears, helical gears, and worms are those in which the profile in a transverse plane (exclusive of the fillet curve) is the involute of a circle. Lands Top and bottom lands =Bottom land= The bottom land is the surface at the bottom of a gear tooth space adjoining the fillet. =Top land= Top land is the (sometimes flat) surface of the top of a gear tooth. Lead Lead is the axial advance of a helix gear tooth during one complete turn (360¬∞), that is, the Lead is the axial travel (length along the axle) for one single complete helical revolution about the pitch diameter of the gear. Lead angle is 90¬∞ to the helix angle between the helical tooth face and an equivalent spur tooth face. For the same lead, the lead angle is larger for smaller gear diameters. It is understood to be measured at the standard pitch diameter unless otherwise specified. A spur gear tooth has a lead angle of 90¬∞, and a helix angle of 0¬∞. See: Helix angle Line of centers The line of centers connects the centers of the pitch circles of two engaging gears; it is also the common perpendicular of the axes in crossed helical gears and worm gears. When one of the gears is a rack, the line of centers is perpendicular to its pitch line.  Module  The module is the measure of gear tooth size which is normally used for metric system gears. It is similar to the Diametral Pitch (DP), which is commonly used for English system (inch measure) gears but they differ in the units used and in that they bear a reciprocal relationship. Module is the pitch circle diameter divided by the number of teeth. Module may also be applied to English system gears, using inch units, but this usage is not in common use. Module is commonly expressed in units of millimeters (mm). MM = Metric Module PD = Pitch Circle Diameter in mm n = Number of Teeth MM = PD / n English system (inch measure) gears are more commonly specified with the Diametral Pitch (DP) which is the number of teeth per inch of diameter of the pitch circle. The units of DP are inverse inches (1/in). DP = Diametral Pitch PD = Pitch Circle Diameter in inches n = Number of Teeth DP = n / PD When converting between module and DP there is an inverse relationship and normally a conversion between the two units of measure (inches and millimeter). Taking both of these into consideration the formulae for conversion are: MM = 25.4 / DP and DP = 25.4 / MM Machinery's Handbook Twenty-Fifth Edition, by Erik Oberg, Franklin D. Jones, Holbrook L. Horton, and Henry H Ryffle, 1996, Industrial Press Inc. Mounting distance Mounting distance Mounting distance, for assembling bevel gears or hypoid gears, is the distance from the crossing point of the axes to a locating surface of a gear, which may be at either back or front. Normal module Normal module is the value of the module in a normal plane of a helical gear or worm. :m_n=m_t \\\\cos \\\\beta \\\\, Normal plane Planes at a pitch point on a helical tooth A normal plane is normal to a tooth surface at a pitch point, and perpendicular to the pitch plane. In a helical rack, a normal plane is normal to all the teeth it intersects. In a helical gear, however, a plane can be normal to only one tooth at a point lying in the plane surface. At such a point, the normal plane contains the line normal to the tooth surface. Important positions of a normal plane in tooth measurement and tool design of helical teeth and worm threads are: #the plane normal to the pitch helix at side of tooth; #the plane normal to the pitch helix at center of tooth; #the plane normal to the pitch helix at center of space between two teeth In a spiral bevel gear, one of the positions of a normal plane is at a mean point and the plane is normal to the tooth trace. Offset Offset Offset is the perpendicular distance between the axes of hypoid gears or offset face gears. In the adjacent diagram, (a) and (b) are referred to as having an offset below center, while those in (c) and (d) have an offset above center. In determining the direction of offset, it is customary to look at the gear with the pinion at the right. For below center offset the pinion has a left hand spiral, and for above center offset the pinion has a right hand spiral. Outside cylinder Cylindrical surfaces The outside (tip or addendum) cylinder is the surface that coincides with the tops of the teeth of an external cylindrical gear. Outside diameter Wormgear diameters The outside diameter of a gear is the diameter of the addendum (tip) circle. In a bevel gear it is the diameter of the crown circle. In a throated worm gear it is the maximum diameter of the blank. The term applies to external gears, this is can also be known from major diameter. Pinion Pinion and annular gear A pinion is a round gear and usually refers to the smaller of two meshed gears. Pitch angle Pitch angle in bevel gears is the angle between an element of a pitch cone and its axis. In external and internal bevel gears, the pitch angles are respectively less than and greater than 90 degrees. Pitch circle A pitch circle (operating) is the curve of intersection of a pitch surface of revolution and a plane of rotation. It is the imaginary circle that rolls without slipping with a pitch circle of a mating gear. These are the outlines of mating gears. Many important measurements are taken on and from this circle. Pitch cone Pitch cones A pitch cone is the imaginary cone in a bevel gear that rolls without slipping on a pitch surface of another gear. Pitch helix Tooth helix The pitch helix is the intersection of the tooth surface and the pitch cylinder of a helical gear or cylindrical worm. =Base helix= The base helix of a helical, involute gear or involute worm lies on its base cylinder. =Base helix angle= Base helix angle is the helix angle on the base cylinder of involute helical teeth or threads. =Base lead angle= Base lead angle is the lead angle on the base cylinder. It is the complement of the base helix angle. =Outside helix= The outside (tip or addendum) helix is the intersection of the tooth surface and the outside cylinder of a helical gear or cylindrical worm. =Outside helix angle= Normal helix Outside helix angle is the helix angle on the outside cylinder. =Outside lead angle= Outside lead angle is the lead angle on the outside cylinder. It is the complement of the outside helix angle. =Normal helix= A normal helix is a helix on the pitch cylinder, normal to the pitch helix. Pitch line The pitch line corresponds, in the cross section of a rack, to the pitch circle (operating) in the cross section of a gear. Pitch point The pitch point is the point of tangency of two pitch circles (or of a pitch circle and pitch line) and is on the line of centers. Pitch surfaces Pitch surfaces Pitch surfaces are the imaginary planes, cylinders, or cones that roll together without slipping. For a constant velocity ratio, the pitch cylinders and pitch cones are circular. Pitch cones Planes=Pitch plane= Pitch planes The pitch plane of a pair of gears is the plane perpendicular to the axial plane and tangent to the pitch surfaces. A pitch plane in an individual gear may be any plane tangent to its pitch surface. The pitch plane of a rack or in a crown gear is the imaginary planar surface that rolls without slipping with a pitch cylinder or pitch cone of another gear. The pitch plane of a rack or crown gear is also the pitch surface. =Transverse plane= The transverse plane is perpendicular to the axial plane and to the pitch plane. In gears with parallel axes, the transverse and the plane of rotation coincide. Principal directions Principal directions Principal directions are directions in the pitch plane, and correspond to the principal cross sections of a tooth. The axial direction is a direction parallel to an axis. The transverse direction is a direction within a transverse plane. The normal direction is a direction within a normal plane. Profile angleProfile radius of curvature Fillet radius Profile radius of curvature is the radius of curvature of a tooth profile, usually at the pitch point or a point of contact. It varies continuously along the involute profile. Rack and pinionRadial composite deviation Total composite variation trace Tooth-to-tooth radial composite deviation (double flank) is the greatest change in center distance while the gear being tested is rotated through any angle of 360 degree/z during double flank composite action test. Tooth-to-tooth radial composite tolerance (double flank) is the permissible amount of tooth-to-tooth radial composite deviation. Total radial composite deviation (double flank) is the total change in center distance while the gear being tested is rotated one complete revolution during a double flank composite action test. Total radial composite tolerance (double flank) is the permissible amount of total radial composite deviation. Root angle Root angle in a bevel or hypoid gear, is the angle between an element of the root cone and its axis. Root circle The root circle coincides with the bottoms of the tooth spaces. Root cone Principal dimensions The root cone is the imaginary surface that coincides with the bottoms of the tooth spaces in a bevel or hypoid gear. Root cylinder The root cylinder is the imaginary surface that coincides with the bottoms of the tooth spaces in a cylindrical gear. Shaft angle Shaft angle A shaft angle is the angle between the axes of two non-parallel gear shafts. In a pair of crossed helical gears, the shaft angle lies between the oppositely rotating portions of two shafts. This applies also in the case of worm gearing. In bevel gears, the shaft angle is the sum of the two pitch angles. In hypoid gears, the shaft angle is given when starting a design, and it does not have a fixed relation to the pitch angles and spiral angles. Spiral gear See: Crossed helical gear. Spiral bevel gearSpur gear Spur gear A spur gear has a cylindrical pitch surface and teeth that are parallel to the axis. Spur rack A spur rack has a planar pitch surface and straight teeth that are at right angles to the direction of motion. Standard pitch circle The standard pitch circle is the circle which intersects the involute at the point where the pressure angle is equal to the profile angle of the basic rack. Standard pitch diameter The standard reference pitch diameter is the diameter of the standard pitch circle. In spur and helical gears, unless otherwise specified, the standard pitch diameter is related to the number of teeth and the standard transverse pitch. standard reference pitch diameter can be estimated by taking average of gear teeth tips diameter and gear teeth base diameter. The pitch diameter is useful in determining the spacing between gear centers because proper spacing of gears implies tangent pitch circles. The pitch diameters of two gears may be used to calculate the gear ratio in the same way the number of teeth is used. : d = \\\\frac{N}{P_d} = \\\\frac{pN}{\\\\pi} \\\\qquad \\\\text{spur gears} : d = \\\\frac{N}{P_{nd}\\\\cos \\\\psi } \\\\qquad \\\\text{helical gears} Where N is the total number of teeth, p is the circular pitch, P_d is the diametrical pitch, and \\\\psi is the helix angle for helical gears. Standard reference pitch diameter The standard reference pitch diameter is the diameter of the standard pitch circle. In spur and helical gears, unless otherwise specified, the standard pitch diameter is related to the number of teeth and the standard transverse pitch. It is obtained as: : d = km = \\\\frac{zp}{\\\\pi} = z\\\\frac{m_n}{\\\\cos\\\\beta } : D = \\\\frac{N}{P_d} = \\\\frac{Np}{\\\\pi}= \\\\frac{N}{P_{nd} \\\\cos\\\\psi} Test radius The test radius (Rr) is a number used as an arithmetic convention established to simplify the determination of the proper test distance between a master and a work gear for a composite action test. It is used as a measure of the effective size of a gear. The test radius of the master, plus the test radius of the work gear is the set up center distance on a composite action test device. Test radius is not the same as the operating pitch radii of two tightly meshing gears unless both are perfect and to basic or standard tooth thickness. Throat diameter Worm gear diameters The throat diameter is the diameter of the addendum circle at the central plane of a worm gear or of a double-enveloping worm gear. Throat form radius Throat form radius is the radius of the throat of an enveloping worm gear or of a double-enveloping worm, in an axial plane. Tip radius Tip radius Tip radius is the radius of the circular arc used to join a side-cutting edge and an end-cutting edge in gear cutting tools. Edge radius is an alternate term. Tip relief Tip relief Tip relief is a modification of a tooth profile whereby a small amount of material is removed near the tip of the gear tooth. Tooth surface Profile of a spur gear Notation and numbering for an external gear Notation and numbering for an internal gear The tooth surface (flank) forms the side of a gear tooth. It is convenient to choose one face of the gear as the reference face and to mark it with the letter ‚ÄúI‚Äù. The other non-reference face might be termed face ‚ÄúII‚Äù. For an observer looking at the reference face, so that the tooth is seen with its tip uppermost, the right flank is on the right and the left flank is on the left. Right and left flanks are denoted by the letters ‚ÄúR‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù respectively.

C. Fields and Me is a 1976 American biographical film directed by Arthur Hiller and starring Rod Steiger and Valerie Perrine. The screenplay by Bob Merrill is based on a memoir by Carlotta Monti, mistress of actor W. C. Fields during the last 14 years of his life. The film was released by Universal Pictures. Plot The story begins in 1924 in New York City, where W. C. Fields is a Ziegfeld Follies headliner, and ends with his 1946 death in California at age 66. In between, it dramatizes his life and career with emphasis on the latter part of both, when the \\"Me\\" of the title, Carlotta Monti, played a prominent role, with a number of fictionalized events added for dramatic impact. Having lost his girlfriend Melody to another man and most of his life savings due to careless investments by his broker, Fields heads west to Santa Monica, where he operates a wax museum until he's offered a film role. He quickly becomes a major screen presence and a notorious drinker. While at a party with his friends John Barrymore, Gene Fowler and restaurant owner Dave Chasen, Fields is introduced to starlet Carlotta Monti, whom he hires as a live-in secretary. In order to stifle her theatrical aspirations, he arranges a screen test. The studio boss Harry Bannerman decides she has some talent, but Fields threatens to quit Paramount Pictures unless she is discouraged from pursuing a career in films. When she learns the truth, Carlotta leaves him and goes to New York. When Barrymore passes away, she returns to Hollywood to comfort Fields. On the set of My Little Chickadee, she learns why her efforts to get him to marry her have routinely been rebuffed: his first marriage has never been dissolved legally. Although hurt by the revelation, Carlotta resigns herself to a life of unwedded bliss that often crumbles into sorrow and frustration as the relentlessly mean-spirited Fields continues to drink heavily and his health steadily declines. The comic is hospitalized and, after enduring great physical pain, dies on Christmas Day, a holiday he had despised with a passion. Principal cast * Rod Steiger as W.C.

However, she turned it down in order to work with Alfred Hitchcock on his final feature-film Family Plot. Rod Steiger's makeup was an early assignment for makeup artist Stan Winston. The Pacific Electric Railway car used in the film had been saved from the scrap heap, refitted with an internal combustion engine, rubber tires, and a steering mechanism, and used in several period films set in Los Angeles prior to its appearance in this film. In 2001 it was refurbished to operate on a rail line serving San Pedro, California. The mansion used for this film was located at 700 Berkshire Avenue, LaCanada Flintridge, Los Angeles County, was previously owned by William Joseph Connery, a silent-movie era independent movie producer. He called the home \\"Villa Ardaree\\" and it was known before that as Dryborough, after the original owners. Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the film \\"dreadful\\" and added, \\"It holds up a wax dummy of a character intended to represent the great misanthropic comedian and expects us to feel compassion but only traps us in embarrassment . . . the movie needn't have been quite as brainless as it is. That took work. First off, Bob Merrill . . . has supplied a screenplay that originally may have been meant as the outline for a musical. It exhibits a tell-tale disregard for facts and the compulsion to make a dramatically shapeless life fit into a two-act form . . . Then there's Arthur Hiller, a director who makes intelligent films when the material is right . . . and terrible ones when the writers fail. Most prominent in the mess is Rod Steiger, who . . . reads all of his lines with the monotonous sing-song manner used by third-rate nightclub comics doing Fields imitations. He also speaks most of them out of the corner of his mouth as if he'd had a stroke.\\" Judith Crist in her review wrote that Steiger as Fields looked \\"like Van Johnson with a clown nose\\". Time Out London calls it a \\"witless biopic [that] leaps through pseudo-history with cretinous inaccuracy. Sloppily slung together, hell-bent on wringing hearts with the drama of the last, lonely, drink-sodden years, it can't get even the simplest facts straight, and doesn't do much of a job on the tear-jerking either . . . Steiger makes a brave stab at the part, but the reality and genius of Fields never get a look in.\\" However, TV Guide awarded it three out of a possible four stars with the comment, \\"Though the great comedian would have hated this film [and Fields purists undoubtedly will be outraged with the many inaccuracies in it], this movie biography . . . has a certain appeal thanks to Steiger's handling of the lead role . . . Rather than ape Fields, [he] creates his own interpretation of the man, capturing subtle nuances that create a better-rounded character.\\" The film has never been released on home video due to the successful efforts of Fields' grandson, a judge in California, to keep it from public view.

The upgrader is owned by Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP), a joint venture of Shell Canada Energy (60%), Marathon Oil Sands L.P. (20%) and Chevron Canada Limited (20%). The facility is located in the industrial development of Scotford, just to the northeast of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta in the Edmonton Capital Region. Site The Scotford Upgrader is a part of a larger site known as Shell Scotford located 40 km northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. Shell Scotford comprises three operating units: the Upgrader, a Refinery, and a Chemical plant. The Scotford Cogeneration Plant is also located on the site. Currently, work is being done on the first Upgrader expansion. In 1984, Shell opened both the Refinery and Chemical plant on the Scotford site. As one of North America's most modern and efficient refineries, the Scotford Refinery was the first to exclusively process synthetic crude oil from Alberta‚Äôs oil sands. Benzene that is produced during the refining process is sent to the adjacent Chemical plant and is used in the production of Styrene Monomer, a chemical needed to make many of the hard plastics people use daily. In 2000, a glycols plant was opened at Scotford Chemicals. Much of the output of the Scotford Upgrader is sold to the Scotford Refinery. Both light and heavy crudes are also sold to Shell's Sarnia Refinery in Ontario. The rest of the synthetic crude is sold to the general marketplace. History of Scotford In 1891, a group of immigrants from Galicia, Austria settled on the land south of the North Saskatchewan River, near the South Victoria Trail. Philip Krebs, along with his son John, settled on the north side of South Victoria Trail. Their home became a popular stopping place for those travelling along the trail. Besides being a hospitable natured man, John was fluent in four European languages (German, English, Polish, and Ukrainian) and could speak Cree - making him popular with those who stopped by. When the Canadian Northern Railway was being built into Fort Saskatchewan, Philip Krebs‚Äô homestead was a natural place for a stop. In 1905, a loading station was erected there, and on the siding of the building was the name ‚ÄúScotford‚Äù (named after Walter Scott and Alexander Rutherford, the premiers of the two provinces ‚Äì Saskatchewan and Alberta - that were formed that same year). The area is still referred to by that name. Description The Scotford Upgrader has a rated processing capacity of , but has at times pumped out more than . It was shut down after being damaged in a fire 19 November 2007. The production was resumed in December 2007. The facility uses hydrogen addition to convert the bitumen from CNRL's Muskeg River Mine in the Athabasca oil sands into refinery-ready sweet, light crude oil. The Muskeg River Mine is the first commercial unit using Shell's Enhance froth treatment technology ‚Äî a process for removing sand, fine clay and water from oil sands froth to make clean bitumen suitable for upgrading via hydrogen addition. According to Shell, the hydrogenation process is well suited to the very clean bitumen produced at the Muskeg River Mine, and results in the upgrader producing more light crude oil than it inputs in the form of heavy bitumen. It also produces lower levels of sulfur dioxide emissions than the alternative coking method which removes carbon to produce petroleum coke as a by-product. The Scotford Upgrader has its own hydrogen manufacturing unit and produces most of the hydrogen required for the hydrogen-addition process. The Scotford Upgrader capacity was expanded by by March 2010, an increase of 60% in capacity. In May 2007, the US$9 billion to US$11.3 billion expansion contract was awarded to TIC, Bantrel Constructors, PCL & KBR. KBR built 160 modules and performed construction work for the Atmospheric and Vacuum (A&V;) unit and Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU). Bantrel completed the tank farm, Utilities, Waterblock and Flare units, PCL completed the Residue Hydroconversion Complex (RHC) and TIC constructed the Hydrogen Manufacturing Unit (HMU) .

The company was founded in 1910 by John P Ahrens and Charles H Fox and built its first motorized fire engine in 1911. By the end of the following year production of horse-drawn fire apparatus ceased completely. Since then, over 1500 pieces of fire apparatus were built until 1977. Ahrens-Fox fire engines were recognizable by the chromed sphere above the pump that held air and smoothed the outgoing pressure fluctuations from the piston pump. During the year 1913 only, Ahrens- Fox built a 44 hp (following then-actual rating practice) automobile. Like at rival American LaFrance, the idea was to sell these cars to bigger fire brigades as a car of duty for their chiefs. Also like at ALF, it was not successful for Ahrens-Fox either, although for Ahrens-Fox the results were more consequential; there was only one model, a huge six-cylinder called the E-C Battalion Roadster. It was guaranteed to go faster than 50 mph, and featured a four speed gearbox. A small pickup bed was added for some items that were thought to be useful for the head of a fire brigade, and was included in the base price. Only six of these roadster-pickups were built during 1913; it seems all stayed in Cincinnati. Ahrens-Fox abandoned the idea and never returned to it. Today, Ahrens-Fox and all of its assets, parts, and paper is owned by W. Kenneth Menke III, president of the Fire Products Company (Powerarc), Webster Groves, Missouri.

One example of such equivalent dish is Lithuanian desert tinginys (Lithuanian: lazy), which is made out of cocoa, broken biscuits, condensed milk and butter, and sometimes nuts, however alternative recipes exist under the same name of the dish. Chocolate salami is not a meat product. The appellation \\"salami\\" stems from physical resemblance. Like salami, chocolate salami is formed as a long cylinder and is sliced across into discs for serving. These discs are a brown, chocolaty matrix (like the red meat of salami) peppered with bright bits of cookie (like the white flecks of fat in salami). In Portugal, they are typically made using Marie biscuit. Some varieties also contain chopped nuts, such as almonds or hazelnuts and may be shaped like truffles. In Greece, chocolate salami is called Mosaiko or Kormos. In Turkey, it is called Mosaic Cake (mozaik pasta). In Romania, it is called biscuit salami (salam de biscui»õi), and it may have originated during the 1970s or 1980s in the communist era, possibly as a result of food shortages.

Both runner and driver are assumed to never tire. The question to be solved is: under what circumstances, and with what strategy, can the driver of the car guarantee that he can always catch the pedestrian, or the pedestrian guarantee that he can indefinitely elude the car? The problem is often used as an unclassified proxy for missile defence and other military targeting, allowing scientists to publish on it without security implications. The problem was proposed by Rufus Isaacs in a 1951 reportR. Isaacs, Games of Pursuit, RAND Corporation (1951) for the RAND Corporation, and in the book Differential Games.R. Isaacs, Differential Games: A Mathematical Theory with Applications to Warfare and Pursuit, Control and Optimization, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1965), PP 349-350. The homicidal chauffeur problem is a classic example of a differential game played in continuous time in a continuous state space. The calculus of variations and level set methods can be used as a mathematical framework for investigating solutions of the problem. Although the problem is phrased as a recreational problem, it is an important model problem for mathematics used in a number of real-world applications. A discrete version of the problem was described by Martin Gardner (in his book Mathematical Carnival, chapter 16), where a squad car of speed 2 chases a crook of speed 1 on a rectangular grid, where the squad car but not the crook is constrained not to make left-hand turns or U-turns.

Folk lore states that Canna edulis Ker-Gawl. is the variety grown for food in South America, but there is no scientific evidence to substantiate the name as a separate species. It is probable that this is simply a synonym of C. discolor, which is grown for agricultural purposes throughout South America and Asia. In the Andes, the rhizome can be harvested within 6 months from planting out and the yields range from 13 - 85 tonnes per hectare, with 22 - 50 tonnes being average, though larger yields are obtained after 8 ‚Äì 10 months. In Queensland, Australia they are able to obtain a yield of 5-10 tons of C. 'Queensland Arrowroot' tubers per acre.Arrowroot, James M. Stephens, University of Florida Most cultivated forms do not produce fertile seed. There are also sterile triploid forms, these contain a significantly higher proportion of starch, though their cropping potential is not known.Khoshoo, T.N. & Guha, I. - Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas. Vikas Publishing HousePolyploidy in CannasMore polyploidy in Cannas Animal fodder The rhizomes and leaves are good fodder for cattle and pigs and it is grown for this purpose in Tropical Africa and Hawaii, where it is harvested 4‚Äì8 months after planting.Burkill, H.M. 1985. The useful plants of west tropical Africa, Vol 1 The foliage of Agricultural Canna is also used for its silage making properties, which are superior to those of corn. Human consumption Canna is still grown for human consumption in the Andes and also in Vietnam and southern China, where the starch is used to make cellophane noodles.Reappraisal of Edible Canna as a High-Value Starch Crop in Vietnam =Edible qualities= Rootstock - actually a rhizome, this can be eaten either raw or cooked. It is the source of canna starch which is used as a substitute for arrowroot. The starch is obtained by rasping the rhizome to a pulp, then washing and straining to get rid of the fibres. This starch is very digestible. The very young rhizomes can also be eaten cooked, they are sweet but fibrous. The rhizome can be very large, sometimes as long as a person's forearm. In Peru the rhizomes are baked for up to 12 hours by which time they become a white, translucent, fibrous and somewhat mucilaginous mass with a sweetish taste. The starch is in very large grains, about three times the size of potato starch grains, and can be seen with the naked eye. This starch is easily separated from the fibre of the rhizome. Young shoots - these can be cooked and eaten as a green vegetable and are quite nutritious, containing at least 10% protein.Plants for a Future - Canna Edulis  See also  * Canna * List of Canna species * List of Canna cultivars * List of Canna hybridists * Canna leaf roller * Canna virus * Canna rust * Japanese beetle  References =NotesBibliography= * Bourne, M.J., G.W.

Early life John C. HillPress coverage of Hill during his lifetime almost never referred to him by using his middle name, Cathles. He was always Mr John Hill, Mr J.C. Hill or J.C. Hill. His building company was J.C Hill & Co. It might be thought safe to assume that he was in happy with the forms of his name used, or, as a powerful late Victorian businessman, he would have taken steps to correct the situation. Example press coverage: . Cathles was a family name and several of his relatives who went by that name were in business and local politics in North London. was born in Hawkhill, Dundee, on 12 December 1857, the eldest son of Robert Hill and his wife Eliza, n√©e Cathles. He had two brothers and three sisters, one of whom died in infancy.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004. When he was three years old his family moved to the village of Auchterhouse in the county of Angus. His father was tollhouse keeper at Auchterhouse which he combined with working as a cartwright and joiner.Hill Archive Guide, University of East Anglia, Bridget Gillies, October 2006. Business career When Hill was seventeen he left home and became a self-employed journeyman carpenter and joiner. After two years he settled in Glasgow where he attended the Mechanics' Institute. There he learned the principles of architecture and construction. At the age of 21 he moved to London, where a relative, George Cathles Porter, was working as a speculative builder in Hornsey. After quickly establishing himself as a joiner, Hill was able to set up his own joinery business within a year. His business was successful and it was not long before he was exploiting the suburban building boom and building houses.Dictionary of Business Biography: Biographical Dictionary of Business Leaders Active in Britain in the Period 1860-1980, Vol III, David J. Jeremy (Ed.), Butterworths,1984, By 1881 he was living as a boarder at 9 Albert Road, off the Seven Sisters Road. He was described as a \\"builder employing 8 men\\".United Kingdom Census, 1881 His first offices were established in Archway, London. =North London= Hill became a prolific developer-architect in North London. Records indicate that he was responsible for building 2,397 houses in or near London and in the city of Peterborough. He focussed on suburban communities for the middle classes complete with houses, shops and pubs. In the 1890s he built up a good part of Harringay, North London. In addition to a few streets of terraced houses to the east of Green Lanes, the development also included a magnificent terrace of shops, Grand Parade, and a vast ornate public house, The Salisbury. He is also credited with large developments in Crouch End including the Grade II* listed Queens pub in Crouch End (and is also in CAMRA's National inventory),\\"London Heritage Pubs - An inside story\\", G. Brandwood & J. Jephcote, CAMRA (2008), the Broadway Parade on the western side of Crouch End Broadway and the Rathcole estate. As a developer Hill experienced a shortage of bricks. He resolved this problem by acquiring a brickfield at Fletton in 1889. This eventually became the London Brick Company. At his Fletton works, he built a huge kiln, called 'Napoleon' which was the biggest in the world. () Hill also owned a chain of five off-licences in north London. When his businesses ran into trouble, these five were taken over by his cousin William Cathles and some survived till the middle of the Twentieth century. In 1910 Hill founded a national association of brick manufacturers to try to tackle the trade's endemic competition which had been threatening its ruin. Like most builders of the period, Hill financed his operations through mortgages. At the beginning of the twentieth century Hill's financial position deteriorated and in 1912 Hill was declared bankrupt with a deficit of over one million pounds. Hill told the bankruptcy court that his failure had been brought about by the Finance Act, 1909, which had entirely destroyed the value the equities his mortgages.'Builders Big Failure', Lincolnshire Echo, 29 November 1912. This same article tells us that Hill had erected 2,597 houses in his time as a house builder at a total cost of ¬£1,909.845. ¬£1,476,000 of this was raised on mortgage. Other appointments Outside his building business, Hill had various other appointments. He was a local councillor in Fletton and served on the London County Council as member for Islington North from 1909 to 1912,Reports of the London County Council for the Years 1909 to 1912, London County Council when he resigned.London Standard May 7, 1912 In 1896 hew was appointed as a director for Olympia Ltd, who owned and ran the Olympia Stadium in London.London Standard January 16, 1896 Family and personal life When he first moved to London Hill was recorded as living at 9 Albert Road, Tottenham, Middlesex. In 1882 he married a grocer's daughter, Matilda Mose, and by 1885 they had moved to 32 Archway Road.Electoral Registers, Islington North, 1885- 1889 In 1890 they were living in Highgate, at the top of Whitehall Park.Electoral Registers, Islington North, 1890 - 1898 Four years later, success enabled a further move to a pseudo-gothic mansion called Southwood Hall at the junction of Muswell Hill Road and Wood Lane in Highgate.Image of Southwood HallHampstead & Highgate Directory, 1895 In 1905 the family moved out of Southwood and into a mansion flat in Hornsey Gardens, albeit an elegant one. Death and legacy For the last four years of his life Hill suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. He died of a heart attack on 5 April 1915 at 20 Ventnor Villas, Hove, while on a visit to the resort.

It was made by film students of the Northern Film School in 2006, post-production finished in 2007. Plot The film is told through the personality of a typical park bench, the Bench narrates retrospectively at his life and the people that has come and gone in his lifetime. Not having the senses that human beings deem normal he lives with his surroundings, in a bubble of feel. Only being able to sense we view this characters life through the warmth of touch, vibration of laughter and the uncertainty of emotion. The film begins with a Tramp lying on a park bench, a narration begins to speak in the first person perspective. As the tramp moves away, the narration still remains with the Bench. The Bench begins reflecting on his youth as a newly fitted bench. The energetic characters that come by and sit on him; a man exercising through the park, children playing chase around him, a young couple kissing, a perverted old man staring at young women at the bus stop. This new sense of life is illustrated by a personal connection the Bench has with a neighbouring bluebird called 'Kevin'. Kevin starts his own little family. The most striking of his offspring is a vibrant yellow bird. After the chicks learn to fly and leave the nest, the mother too leaves Kevin. The Bench shows empathy towards Kevin's loneliness. 'Night' people as they called, the hooligans, the drunken tramps come and deface and abuse the bench. The bench finds some ways of getting revenge (E.g. A drunk tries to get a bottle cap off by hitting it against the Bench, the cap comes off and hits him in the face.) The vandalism gets the better of the Bench and he is worn down. He realises now that people don't want to be near him anymore. At the same time, he discovers that Kevin too has perished and he begins to understand that this is the way of things. The Bench is removed piece by piece and bundled away in a van. A brand new bench has now replace it, the vibrant yellow bird returns to the tree and so on; the cycle of life continues. Production The film was shot within a studio against blue screen, later a computer generated world was added that surrounded the bench and the live action characters. Another character that was added was Kevin, a small animated hand drawn bird. Release In 2007, the film was screened at the Leeds International Film Festival during a showcase of other work by the Northern Film School. The film is currently still being shown on the BBC Big Screen in Leeds City centre on Millennium Square.

It was founded in 1975, having grown out of the Family Squatters Advisory Service. After being based for many years in St. Paul's Road in Islington, ASS moved its offices to Whitechapel High Street the same building as Freedom Press. History In the late 1960s, the Family Squatters Advisory Service (FSAS) was founded in London, England, to help defend the rights of squatters. However, in the 1973 case of McPhail vs. Persons Unknown, the Court of Appeal stated that a landowner could re-enter a squatted property and use reasonable force to evict those occupying the property, while remaining exempt from the Forcible Entry Act. Thus, as a result of this ruling, all power lay in the hands of the possessor of the property, rather than the occupants.Law and the Underprivileged, Smith, Chris and Hoath, David C. 1975, Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd, London This case sparked a division amongst those fighting for squatters' rights at the FSAS, for new-wave advocates thought that the FSAS did not do enough to protect the unlicensed squatters' rights. That division gave rise to a different organization called the All London Squatters (ALS). The ALS was geared more toward direct action and was open to licensed and unlicensed squatters. ALS was perceived as more militant. As tensions heightened in London, FSAS split even further. The division between those for and opposed to unlicensed squatters grew deeper, and by 1975, divisions within the group led to its dissolution. In its wake grew a new organization called the Advisory Service for Squatters (ASS).Squatting: The Real Story, Wates, Nick and Wolmar, Christian, 1980, Bay Leaf Books A spokesperson for the group said in 2003 \\"Today's squatters are highly organised and efficient. Many have full-time work, and drug problems are rare.\\"Fallon A. \\"Squatters are back, and upwardly mobile,\\" The Independent on Sunday, October 12, 2003 Squatters Handbook ASS publishes the Squatters Handbook which both serves as a guide for how and where to squat and explains the legal issues involved. 150,000 copies have been sold since 1976.The thirteenth edition was published in 2009, and the fourteenth in October, 2016. The Squatters' Handbook details guidelines on how to find property to squat in, what to do in confrontations with the police, how to maintain the property and set up temporary plumbing, and generally how to survive while squatting. It can be purchased for a small fee from the Advisory Service. Eric Pickles criticises councils for signposting ASS In June 2008 the ASS was subject to controversy when The Daily Mail reported on the Squatters Handbook. Eric Pickles, Conservative MP for Brentwood and Ongar, criticised councils for publishing the Squatters Handbook and the ASS contact details on council websites. He said ‚ÄúHomeowners will be horrified that town halls are giving squatters the green light to break into law-abiding citizens‚Äô homes ... Promoting such lawlessness is breathtaking, but is sadly an indictment of social breakdown that has become rife under Labour and the prevalence of 'human rights' laws. This revelation coupled with fact violent crime is doubling blows apart Labour's claim to be the party of law and order.‚ÄùAdvisory Service for Squatters - Squatting is Still Legal. Advisory Service for Squatters In response the ASS issued a press release explaining that \\"Councils signpost ASS on their websites because we offer free advice to homeless people and those with housing problems.\\" In the press release the ASS also stated that \\"Squatters only occupy empty properties. In those cases where a mistake is made and there is an occupier, the squatters can be quickly removed by legal mechanisms.\\" and that \\"squatting mostly happens in housing that‚Äôs been left to rot, whether by councils or private owners.\\" The ASS also stated that it \\"does not promote lawlessness, as squatting is still legal. We help disadvantaged people to find housing, to help themselves when no one else will. We often recommend that people who are eligible for Priority Need Housing apply to their local Council.\\" The ASS further stated that \\"Human Rights laws are generally unavailable to squatters as a defence.\\" And that \\"the real issue is the difficulty of getting housed, due to profiteering through privatisation and gentrification, which leads to unaffordable rents and the need to take personal action.\\"  See also  * Squatting in England and Wales * Social centres in the United Kingdom NotesExternal links * Category:Housing organisations based in London Category:Housing rights organizations Category:Organizations established in 1975 Category:Squatting in the United Kingdom ","title":"Advisory Service for Squatters"},{"id":"15008015","text":"Location of Alexander Island in the Antarctic Peninsula region Satellite image of Alexander Island Shaw Nunatak () is a nunatak rising to 500 m in Nichols Snowfield, northern Alexander Island, Antarctica.

After the Restoration in 1660, she was renamed HMS Bonaventure after a previous ship built in 1653 that had been blown up three years later.Lavery, Ships of the Line, vol.1, p. 158. She was widened in 1663, and by 1677 her armament had been increased to 48 guns. In 1683 she underwent her first rebuild, relaunching as a 40-gun fourth rate ship of the line. Bonaventure was rebuilt a second time in 1699 at Woolwich Dockyard, relaunching as a fourth rate of between 46 and 54 guns. Her third rebuild took place at Chatham Dockyard, where she was rebuilt as a 50-gun fourth rate to the 1706 Establishment, relaunching on 19 September 1711. She was renamed HMS Argyll prior to the Jacobite rising of 1715, and on 27 January 1720 she was ordered to be taken to pieces at Woolwich for what was to be her final rebuild. She was relaunched as a 50-gun fourth rate to the 1719 Establishment on 5 July 1722, and saw much service in home and Atlantic waters. She was employed on blockade duties during the War of the Austrian Succession, and in 1741 Argyll captured five Spanish coasters, and with the assistance of two other warships cut free five captured British warships that were docked in north-western Spain. In 1742 Argyll served to escort convoys of East Indiamen from St. Helena to England. In 1745 she returned to Britain by way of escorting a convoy and was paid off in 1746. After the conclusion of the war in 1748, Argyll was towed to Harwich and scuttled as part of a breakwater.

Licensed to Kennewick, Washington, United States, the radio station is currently owned by the Kennewick School District. It broadcasts from the Tri-Tech Skills Center in Kennewick, by students as part of extra classes taken by Juniors and Seniors from high schools in the Tri- City area. History Originally supervised by Marv Carstens, the station's early years included great friction with some elements of the community over the all heavy metal format. The station was shut down for a time due to complaints from Evangelicals. It was reborn in the late 1980s as a billboard top 40 station. Broadcast hours were severely curtailed during this time frame; sign off was at 5:00pm. The Top 40 format was never embraced within the station and did not succeed. The early 1990s brought a first for the Tri- Cities: a classic rock format. The station shifted away from the unpopular top 40 format and during class hours ran the classic rock format. After class hours, students ran special programs from 3:00pm to 5:00pm sign off. Also during this time, as a test, Tri-Tech's administration loosened up on the station and allowed Friday night KTCV to broadcast until 10:00pm. The classic rock format was phased out after country KOTY 106.5 became KEGX 'The Eagle 106.5\\" in 1993 with its own classic rock format. KTCV then shifted to more of an underground rock format. New slogan was \\"88.1 The Alternative.\\" That branding existed until the late 2000s with the station rebranding as \\"88.1 The Edge.\\" Today, local radio veteran Ed Dailey has taught the program since 1997. The station has broadcast 24/7 since the early 2000s with the addition of an automation system. Unlike the early days when KTCV always had a live DJ, today KTCV reflects the industry standard and operates primarily with automation and voice tracking. Mid-1990s Crises The 1990s brought a few crises to the station. The most serious, was a challenge to the license in 1996 by two outside groups. At the time, KTCV was running severely restricted hours again due to internal problems. The outside groups attempted to force a shared frequency agreement with the Kennewick School District. This would've set the stage for the Kennewick School District to completely lose the station. However, some decisive actions were enacted by the Tri-Tech administration and the license was saved. Additionally, the station's license accidentally expired during this era without a proper renewal forcing the station to go off the air. Through luck and immediate action, the FCC allowed the station an emergency renewal. Another event that forced the station to go off the air was an incident with an outdated EAS relay system. KTCV stayed off the air until the system was updated. As KTCV has entered the 21st century, stability has been the rule. The station has been well cared for by Mr. Dailey and the Tri- Tech administration. Coverage KTCV has gone through various signal upgrades over the years. Originally, with an ERP of 320 watts that covered Kennewick well, but listeners in West Richland and especially Benton City had a difficult time receiving the station. Power was increased in the late 1990s to 1100. Today, the current ERP of the station is 3500 watts. The current signal now does well for the most part in the greater Tri-City area. Benton City continues to have reception problems in some places due to geography. Reception of KTCV is no longer possible in Walla Walla due to K-LOVE translator K201DX. Reception to the south across the Oregon border is spotty. This is due to the geography of the region and location of KTCV's tower. To the north, KTCV reaches approximately 35 miles north of the Tri-Cities along US Highway 395. The farthest report of KTCV reception has been over a distance of 90 miles from the Tri-Cities at the Sprague Lake rest area along Interstate 90. Mission The station operates as a learning tool for the students of the Radio Broadcasting program at the Tri-Tech Skills Center. First year students learn about radio history, radio theory, public speaking, broadcast writing and various live audio applications. First year students also read short newscasts on KTCV. Second year students take a more active role in KTCV; from day-to-day operations and on-air announcing. These students learn the NEXGEN digital automation in addition to the Selector software, Pro-Tools and Adobe Audition. Unique to KTCV is the students' influence on the format and programming. KTCV is one of only a few high school stations in the state that the students take an active role in operations, programming and management. Community Radio Class In addition to students, an adult community radio class is offered from time to time. This gives adults in the great Tri-City area an opportunity to learn the skills that the high school age students acquire. These class attendees read news and voice track for KTCV in addition to learning radio broadcasting history and theory, news writing and proper announcing techniques. Adults who complete this course are able to submit proposals for their own specialty show on KTCV to Mr. Dailey just like the regular Tri-Tech Radio Broadcasting students.

He made 3 known appearances in first- class cricket matches between 1775 and 1778, but it is believed he was playing much earlier as he had become the landlord of the White Hart at Chertsey by 1773.

Plot Eddie Rico (Richard Conte) is the happily married owner of a prosperous laundry company in Bayshore, Florida. Later in the film we discover that years ago he had been the accountant for a major crime syndicate. He has given up his ties to the syndicate, and hopes to adopt a child with his wife, Alice. When the film opens, Eddie's sleep is interrupted by a call from Phil, a mob operative, who demands Eddie provide employment and a place to lay low for someone who turns out to be a hitman named Wesson (William Phipps). Eddie's young wife Alice becomes worried that the syndicate will bring Eddie back into a life of crime. Eddie calms her, but then receives a worrisome letter from his mother saying that his two brothers, Johnny (James Darren) and Gino (Paul Picerni), who are both still involved with the mob, have disappeared. Shortly thereafter, while he is driving, Eddie realizes the vehicle that taps him at a stop light is being driven by his brother, Gino. Off the main street, they both pull over; Gino slides into Eddie's front seat and, in desperation, begs Eddie to help him get out of the country. Gino admits to being the gunman in a gang killing and identifies Johnny as having been his driver. Gino now believes the syndicate is planning to get rid of him; out of the blue they've ordered him to St. Louis. Eddie cannot believe that the syndicate is after him; he has complete faith in the benevolence of Sid Kubik (Larry Gates), the syndicate boss, who Eddie believes thinks of the Ricos as family, just as Eddie thinks of Kubik as a father. Consequently, Eddie tells Gino to go to St. Louis‚Äî\\"Have I ever steered you wrong?\\"‚Äîand gives him some money to do so. When Eddie returns to work, he takes a call from \\"Uncle\\" Sid Kubik, who orders him to Miami for a face-to-face conference. Eddie leaves, despite his wife's objections that he will miss an adoption interview. Eddie meets Kubik in Miami, where Kubik apologizes for the orders given earlier regarding Wesson and congratulates Eddie on his impending adoption. Kubik says the syndicate does not know where Johnny is, but they are concerned. It seems that Johnny's new wife's brother Peter Malaks (Lamont Johnson)‚Äîwho doesn't at all approve of Johnny or of his having married his sister Norah‚Äîhas met with prosecutors on a number of occasions. Naturally, the bosses feel that as a result of what Peter tells them, Johnny will be \\"persuaded\\" to turn on the syndicate and testify against them in return for clemency. After Eddie insists that he does not believe Johnny would ever rat on them, Kubik tells Eddie that while he believes in Johnny's loyalty, others aren't so sure. In order for Johnny's life to be saved, Kubik says that Eddie must find him and get him to leave the country. After Eddie leaves to do what he has been ordered, Kubik walks down the hall to enter another room where Gino, his face battered from a beating being administered by one of Kubik's henchmen, is seen slumped in a chair with only enough strength to raise his head and say with bitter sarcasm, \\"Thanks, uncle Sid.\\" Eddie arrives in New York City and finds Peter Malaks. When Eddie says that Johnny may be in a lot of trouble, Malaks angrily refuses to help find him, calling Johnny a gangster and telling Eddie that maybe Johnny would be better off dead. Eddie then visits his mother (Argentina Brunetti) to ask her where Johnny is, but she proclaims that even though she once took a bullet to protect Kubik's life, she no longer trusts the man, in large part because Gino had told her not to. Indeed, she tells Eddie as he is leaving not to trust anybody. When Eddie tells her that Johnny's life is in danger, she laments, kneeling to pray in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary she has sitting on a shelf, but refuses to tell Eddie anything. Finally, as Eddie is walking out the door, she relents and reveals, with great trepidation, that Johnny last wrote her from El Camino, California. Eddie has to take two planes to El Camino, where he finds Johnny and his pregnant wife, Norah (Kathryn Crosby) hiding out on a friend's farm. Johnny says he's left the syndicate because he wants his son to grow up to be clean and not know a life of crime. Norah, pregnant, is distraught at the prospect of Johnny being dragged back into the syndicate and collapses; she needs a doctor and one is called. Johnny tells Eddie to leave. Eddie returns to his hotel where Mike Lamotta (Harry Bellaver), a local crime boss, is waiting in Eddie's room. There, Eddie realizes that Kubik has used him to locate Johnny and all along has intended that Johnny be killed. Lamotta orders Eddie to call Johnny and tell him to meet the mobsters waiting outside the house where he's staying. Instead, after Johnny joyously tells Eddie that he's a new father, Eddie urges Johnny to go to the cops; he is immediately knocked out by Lamotta's assistant, Gonzales (Rudy Bond). To save his wife and newborn son, Johnny goes outside, where he is killed. As Eddie and Gonzales fly back to Florida, Eddie learns that Gino had attempted to flee the country and was also killed. While in a bathroom during their stopover in Phoenix, Eddie knocks Gonzales out. He takes Gonzales' pistol and calls Alice, telling her to leave their house in Florida and meet him in New York at a special place only they know about. Eddie then manages to elude Kubik's minions by hitching a ride to New York in a truck transporting new cars. He goes to Peter Malaks and informs him that both his brothers have been murdered and that he intends to testify against the syndicate. Malaks, now convinced of Eddie's sincerity, agrees to meet him the next day at a bank where Eddie will give him money to care for his now-widowed sister and their new nephew. The next day, Eddie goes to the bank (where an informant there recognizes him and rats him out to Kubik via phone), gets a pile of cash from his safe-deposit box, and puts some in three envelopes‚Äîone for Malaks, one for Alice so she can get safely out of the country, and one for his mother. He meets Malaks and Alice outside in a cab and gives each their envelopes. He sends the weeping Alice to the airport with Malaks. When Eddie goes to say goodbye to his mother and give her her envelope, Kubik is there and holds him at gunpoint. Eddie pulls out the gun he took from Gonzales in Phoenix and kills both Kubik and his accomplice, but is wounded himself. In a newspaper headline shot, we discover that Eddie, apparently recovered from his wound, has testified against the syndicate and that it has been successfully prosecuted and destroyed. The final scene shows Eddie driving with Alice up to the children's home where they apparently are meeting with the administrators to finalize the adoption of their new child.

Performances are first-class right down the line, Conte a standout as a man finally disillusioned after thinking of the syndicate leader who orders his brother's execution as a close family friend. Both femmes have comparatively little to do, Dianne Foster as Conte's wife and Kathryn Grant as the brother's, but make their work count.

The case is formally identified and cited as \\"No 5\\",L Sealy and S Worthington, Company Law (OUP 2007) though some observers regard it as the sixth in the saga of litigation concerning Barings Bank. Facts Nick Leeson was a dishonest futures trader in Singapore for the Barings Bank. He traded in the front office and also did work, in breach of an internal audit recommendation, in the back office, auditing his own team's trades. This allowed him to effectively act as his own supervisor. Leeson abused this situation to secretly make increasingly large unauthorized trades on his employer's behalf. He fraudulently doctored the bank's accounts, and reported large profits, while trading at losses. After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the stock market went into a downward spiral, and the truth of his losses was uncovered, bankrupting Barings Bank. The Secretary of State sought director disqualification orders under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against three directors of Barings for their failure to supervise his activities. They were alleged to be incompetent, and therefore \\"unfit to be concerned in the management of a company\\" (sections 6-8). Judgement=High Court= Jonathan Parker J held that the three directors should be disqualified. Unfitness was determined by the objective standard that should ordinarily be expected of people fit to be directors of companies. Directors must inform themselves of company affairs and join in with other directors to supervise those affairs. Having no adequate system of monitoring was therefore a breach of this standard. Directors may delegate functions, but they nevertheless remain responsible for those functions being carried out. Furthermore, the degree of a director's remuneration will be a relevant factor in determining the degree of responsibility with which a director must reckon.[1999] 1 BCLC 433 =Court of Appeal= Morritt LJ, Waller LJ and Mummery LJ upheld Jonathan Parker J's decision in full.

Cross-Docking)is the process of transferring a shipment from one mode of transportation to another. It is most commonly employed when one mode cannot be used for the entire trip, such as when goods must be shipped internationally from one inland point to another. Such a trip might require transport by truck to an airport, then by airplane overseas, and then by another truck to its destination; or it might involve bulk material (such as coal) loaded to rail at the mine and then transferred to a ship at a port. Transloading is also required at railroad break-of-gauge points, since the equipment between lines is not compatible. Since transloading requires handling of the goods, it causes a higher risk of damage. Therefore, transloading facilities are designed with the intent of minimizing handling. Due to differing capacities of the different modes, the facilities typically require some storage facility, such as warehouses or rail yards. For bulk goods, specialized material handling and storage are typically provided (as, for example, in grain elevators). Intermodal transport limits handling by using standardized containers, which are handled as units and which also serve for storage if needed. Transloading versus transshipment Transloading may be confused with transshipment, but in modern usage they represent different concepts. Transloading concerns the mechanics of transport, while transshipment is essentially a legal term addressing how the shipment originates and is destined. Consider a load of grain that is transloaded at an elevator, where it is combined with grain from other farms and thus leaves on the train as a distinct shipment from that in which it arrived. It thus cannot be said to be transshipped. Or consider a package shipped through a package delivery service or by mail: it may change shipping mode several times along the trip, but since it is (from an external point of view) conveyed as a single shipment regardless of how it is conveyed or what else travels with it on the legs of its journey, it is not considered to be transshipped. Conversely, a load on a truck can be taken in one (legal) shipment to an intermediate point and then to its ultimate destination without ever leaving the truck. If this is specified as two shipments, then the goods are transshipped, but no transloading has taken place. The modern distinction between transloading and transshipment was not well codified in the period of the mid-19th through mid-20th centuries, when discussions of break of gauge often used the word transshipment for what today's careful usage would call transloading, or for any combination of transloading and transshipment. Transloading facilities Container cranes are used to transfer containers to/from container ships. Transloading can occur at any place. A truck can pull up to another truck or a train, and transloading may be accomplished by no more elaborate means than teamsters and stevedores. In the interests of speed and efficiency, however, a variety of specialized equipment is used to handle the goods. Thus, intermodal facilities have specialized cranes for handling the containers, and coal piers have car dumpers, loaders, conveyors, and other equipment for unloading and loading railroad cars and ships quickly and with a minimum of personnel. Often the equipment used to ship the goods is optimized for rapid transfer. For instance, the shipment of automobiles is expedited by autorack rail cars and roll-on/roll-off ships, which can be loaded without cranes or other equipment. Standardized containers allow the use of common handling equipment and obviate break bulk handling. Transloading is often combined with classification and routing facilities, since the latter often require handling of goods. Transloading may occur at railway sidings and break-of-gauge stations. Where ports are too small to handle large bulk carrier ships, transloading can occur at sea, using transhipment platforms, ships, or floating cranes and barges.

She was out of the first crop sired by Seattle Slew, 1977's Horse of the Year and the 10th winner of America's Triple Crown. Her dam was Strip Poker, by Bold Bidder, sired by Bold Ruler. History Bred by Francis Kernan in Kentucky on Spendthrift Farm, the yearling Landaluce was chosen at auction for buyers Lloyd French and Barry Beal by Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Her price tag was $650,000. Lukas said he noticed her \\"tremendous heart girth\\". Beal and French named their new filly after a guide on a Spanish ranch they had once visited, Francisco Landaluce. Racing only at two, during that year Landaluce started five times and won each race. Her combined winning margin was 46¬Ω lengths, 21 of those lengths coming in the Grade II Hollywood Lassie Stakes. She debuted at Hollywood Park Racetrack on July 3, 1982, winning a six-furlong Maiden Special Weight in a time of 1:08 1/5. (The horse that placed seven lengths behind her, Some Kinda Flirt, won her next race by a huge margin.) Her jockey was Hall of Famer Laffit Pincay, Jr.. Riding her once, Pincay chose to continue riding her. He said, \\"Normally, I am not a superstitious man, but I walk around these days hoping nothing happens to her. When I see Wayne Lukas walking towards me, my instinct is to turn away. I am afraid he is going to tell me something has gone wrong. I never want to hear that she has turned a hair.\\" On July 10, Landaluce won the six-furlong Hollywood Lassie by 21 lengths in 1:08 flat. Her margin of victory remains the largest ever run in any race by a two-year-old at Hollywood Park. Her time is said to be the fastest clocking ever for a juvenile filly in a one-turn, six-furlong race. Lukas was quoted as saying, \\"You search and you look, and then all of a sudden, it comes, that star, and you know you have been blessed with something special.\\" At Del Mar Racetrack on September 5, Landaluce won the one-mile Del Mar Debutante Stakes. She then went to Santa Anita Park for the October 11 running of the seven-furlong Grade II Anoakia Stakes, which she won by eight lengths. Her last race, and her last victory, was the one-and- one-sixteenth-mile Grade I Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita. Lukas was now pointing her towards the Grade I Hollywood Starlet Stakes, scheduled to run on November 28. But on November 22, Landaluce became ill. Lukas, knowing it was a virus, was still hopeful she would make the Starlet. However, Landaluce had colitis X, a disease that nearly killed her sire.http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/stallion- directory/%5Creference.aspx?doc=seattleslew Landaluce, though, steadily weakened from the blood clots formed by a severe bacterial invasion and died on November 28, 1982. Landaluce was posthumously awarded the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly for 1982. The Hollywood Lassie Stakes was renamed the Landaluce Stakes in her honor, and she was buried in the infield at Hollywood Park. After the closure of Hollywood Park in 2014, her remains were moved to Spendthrift Farm in Kentucky. See also * List of Undefeated horses References * \\"D.

The station's broadcast license is held by the Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc. It airs an English/Spanish language radio format of Top 40 (CHR) music and news as a non- commercial outlet, serving Fresno County. The station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 6,000 watts, broadcasting from a tower at 100 meters (328 feet) in height above average terrain (HAAT). The tower is southwest of Fresno, in Cantua Creek, California.Radio-Locator.com/KBHH History=Launch (1996-2007)= In May 1996, Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc., was among the applicants to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new radio station in Kernan. After a settlement among the applicants was reached in January 1998, the FCC granted the permit on April 16, 1998, with a scheduled expiration date of April 16, 2001. The new station was assigned call sign \\"KBHH\\" on July 17, 1998. After construction and testing were completed in April 2001, the station was granted its broadcast license on June 18, 2001. =Periods of Silence (2008-2014)= On November 14, 2008, the station's signal went dark in response to the late-2000s recession. On December 4, 2008, the station applied to the FCC for special temporary authority to remain silent, asserting that it was \\"unable to operate profitably in the current economic climate\\". The station reported that it resumed broadcasting on November 12, 2009. This is just one day short of the one year of continuous silence that would have left the station's broadcast license subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation. Four days later, on November 16, 2009, KBHH again fell silent. Citing the same conditions in its December 7, 2009, request to remain off the air, the station was granted authorization to remain silent on March 10, 2010, with a scheduled expiration date of September 7, 2010. The station reported to the FCC it resumed operations \\"at licensed parameters\\" on November 10, 2010, again just two days before the one-year maximum. Two days later, on November 12, 2010, the station once again went off the air. Again citing the inability to operate profitably in a December 2, 2010, FCC filing, the station was granted authority to remain silent on September 29, 2011, with a firm expiration date of November 12, 2011. Moving the Transmitter In March 2011, with the station still off the air, KBHH management applied to the FCC to relocate its broadcast transmitter southwest of Fresno to the top of a hill near Cantua Creek, California. This move would improve signal coverage in the Fresno area without increasing power output. To accommodate the move, KBHH also asked the FCC to relocate under-construction KAAX in Avenal, California, from its originally permitted 95.1 MHz to 106.9 MHz to prevent interference due to short-spacing of the two tower sites. The FCC approved the plan and issued a new construction permit to make these changes on October 17, 2011, with a scheduled expiration of October 17, 2014. =Regional Mexican era (2014-2018)= Michael Nowakowski, the vice-president of the Communications Fund of the Cesar Chavez Foundation led the coalition to re-launch KBHH in the Central Valley. Alongside Bill Barquin, chief operation officer, both helped relaunch the station in October 2014, branded as \\"La Campesina 95.3 FM\\" as part of the Radio Campesina Network. (\\"Campesina\\" is a Spanish word meaning \\"peasant\\" or \\"farmworker\\".) Anthony Chavez, president of Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc., is the youngest son of American farm worker, labor leader, and civil rights activist C√©sar Ch√°vez. KBHH is one of about a dozen Radio Campesina stations in California, Arizona, Nevada and Washington serving farmworkers. =CHR era (2019-present)= On June 9, 2019, without any prior announcement, KBHH flipped to CHR, branded as \\"Forge 95.3\\". The programs are presented in English, and the playlist features current-based pop music in English and Spanish. The station has opened a request line, where listeners can make music suggestions. KBHH has already begun introducing personalities under the new format.InsideRadio.com \\"Danny Morrison\\" June 11, 2019 The format change was due to Farmworker Educational acquiring KVPW from the EMF two months later, with the \\"La Campesina\\" affiliation moving there after that sale's closure.

Design and development The Fledgling was designed in response to a 1927 Navy requirement for a new primary trainer, and was selected after evaluation in competition with fourteen other submissions. The Fledgling was a conventional biplane design with two-bay, staggered wings of equal span braced with N-struts. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits, and the fixed tailskid undercarriage could be easily swapped for a large central pontoon and outrigger floats under the wings for seaplane training. The Navy ordered two batches of the Fledgling, each powered by different versions of the Wright Whirlwind engine, both of which were built under the Curtiss designation Model 48. Believing the design to have commercial potential, Curtiss developed the Model 51 as a civil equivalent powered by the less powerful Curtiss Challenger engine. The company operated 109 of these aircraft in its own air taxi service, the Curtiss Flying Service during the 1930s. A number of these aircraft were experimentally fitted with the same Wright engines used in their military counterparts as the J-1 and J-2, but these were not produced in quantity. Another experimental variant, the reduced-wingspan Fledgling Junior was produced to the extent of a single prototype only. A number of Model 51s were exported to foreign military services for evaluation: four to Canada and one to Czechoslovakia, but these did not lead to any purchases. Curtiss also delivered at least seven N2C-1 kits to Turkey in 1933, as part of an agreement to produce the Curtiss Hawk Model 35 under licence in Turkey. These N2C-1s were used as trainers and liaison aircraft by the Turkish Air Force until 1945. At least one N2C-1 is thought to have been given to Iran as a gift from the Turkish Air Force.

Railroad and service  The Columbus, Delaware and Marion Railway, or CD&M;, provided interurban service connecting Columbus, Delaware, Marion, Worthington, and Bucyrus, Ohio. It also provided local street car service in Marion and Delaware. The CD&M; provided local and interurban service on of track as The Columbus, Delaware and Marion Electric Railway Company. It operated service to Bucyrus through the Delaware, Marion and Bucyrus Railroad on an additional of track. At Bucyrus the railway met the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway for connecting service to Cleveland. The CD&M; also generated electricity for Marion and sold power to the Middle West Utilities System. As a means of increasing off hours riders, the company developed Glenmary Park north of Worthington to attract interurban passengers with playing fields and picnic areas, and provided partial funding for Crystal Lake Amusement Park north of Marion, Ohio.  History  Abutments of a former flyover over what is now the CSX Columbus Subdivision outside Delaware The Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Railway was formed in 1901 to establish interurban service north of Columbus, Ohio. The CD&M; Railway purchased the Columbus, Clinton and Worthington Street Railway. At the same time, a rival company, the Columbus, Delaware and Northern Railroad, acquired a right-of-way between Columbus and Marion. The CD&M; Railway bought its rival and the railroad began interurban service in 1903. In October 1904, the CD&M; incorporated as a holding company operating through its subsidiary the Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Electric Railroad. In 1908, the company built the Columbus, Marion, and Bucyrus Railway to connect Columbus to the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway at Bucyrus with plans for service to Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo. The Columbus Marion and Bucyrus operated passenger service from Columbus to Bucyrus and nightly through freight service between Columbus and Cleveland. In 1909, both the CD&M; Railway Company and its Bucyrus subsidiary went bankrupt. The Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus emerged from bankruptcy in 1914, and in 1917, the CD&M; was reorganized as the Columbus, Delaware and Marion Electric Company. = Decline and abandonment = The Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus Railway lost money during the late 1920s. The railway went bankrupt in 1930 and was absorbed into Columbus, Delaware, and Marion in 1931. In 1931, the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway abandoned its rail lines, causing the CD&M; to lose revenue from its Cleveland freight service in 1933 The company filed for bankruptcy in March 1933 and abandoned rail passenger service in August 1933. Passenger rail was replaced by bus service. The CD&M; Electric Company was merged with the Reserve Power Company to form Marion-Reserve Power Company in 1937. The Ohio Railway Museum in Worthington operates on about one mile of former Columbus, Delaware and Marion right-of-way. The museum's collection includes a preserved CD&M; parlor car numbered 501. Until 1969, another segment of CD&M; track, leading to a power plant, was used in Marion.

Close to the city, over a flat highland or meseta (12,000 feet over sea level) is the old famed Inca city called Wanuku Pampa, Wanuku Marka or Wanuku Viejo. The most important festival is by the end of July and it is called \\"La Fiesta del Sol\\".:es:La Uni√≥n, Hu√°nuco  Geography = Location = The coordinates are: . It occupies an area of the Urqumayu valley which serves as a boundary with the Rip√°n District, with which it communicates by two bridges, at an altitude of 3204 m, corresponding to the region Quechua, according to Javier Pulgar Vidal in his classification of eight natural regions of Peru. The closeness of the valley gives a configuration elongated north‚Äìsouth, bounded on the east by the plateau of Wanuku Pampa and the hill Pallqa, on the west by the foothills of the upper valley, where villages are located Anchacgrande, Quchapampa and Liriopampa in the Rip√°n District. Because of the proximity to the town R√≠pan (just one of the only cross two bridges), often in both villages is mentioned with the name of La Uni√≥n, sometimes called La Uni√≥n ‚Äì R√≠pan. The two bridges that cross the river, have different characteristics: * The first bridge made of stone masonry bridge called C√°ceres, only used for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. * The second made of steel and wood (floor of the bridge), called the Union bridge, if used for motorized transport (buses, trucks, etc.) and pedestrian.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 When it was the archbishopric and Electorate of Trier, it was one of the most important states of the Holy Roman Empire, both as an ecclesiastical principality and as a diocese of the church. Unlike the other Rhenish dioceses ‚Äî Mainz and Cologne, Trier was the former Roman provincial capital of Augusta Treverorum. Given its status, Trier has always been the seat of a bishop since Roman times, one of the oldest dioceses in all of Germany. The diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese in the time of Charlemagne and was the metropolitan for the dioceses of Metz, Toul, and Verdun. After the victory of Napoleon Bonaparte of France, the archdiocese was lowered to a diocese and is now a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cologne. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Peter. History The bishops of Trier were already virtually independent territorial magnates in Merovingian times. In 772 Charlemagne granted Bishop Wiomad complete immunity from the jurisdiction of the ruling count for all the churches and monasteries, as well as villages and castles that belonged to the Church of St. Peter at Trier. In his will he also elevated the diocese to the Archdiocese of Trier, with suffragans on both sides of the Rhine. This arrangement lasted over a thousand years. In Early Modern times, the archdiocese of Trier still encompassed territory along the Moselle River between Trier, near the French border, and Koblenz on the Rhine. The Archbishop of Trier, as holder of an imperial office was traditionally an Imperial Elector of the German king. The purely honorary office of Archchancellor of Gaul arose in the 13th century. In this context that was taken to mean the Kingdom of Arles, or Burgundy, technically from 1242 and permanently from 1263, and nominally until 1803. Arles along with Germany and Italy was one of the three component kingdoms of the Empire. The last elector removed to Koblenz in 1786. From 1795, the territories of the Archbishopric on the left bank of the Rhine ‚Äî which is to say almost all of them ‚Äî were under French occupation, and were annexed in 1801 and a separate bishopric established (later assuming control of the whole diocese in 1803). In 1803, what was left of the Archbishopric was secularized and annexed by the Princes of Nassau.

It travels west-to-east from the Alabama state line in Columbus across the central portion of the state through cities such as Macon, Dublin, Statesboro, and Savannah to connect to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Tybrisa Street and Inlet Avenue in Tybee Island, near the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the roadway continues as Butler Avenue. In Georgia, all U.S. Highways have at least one state highway that travel concurrently along its route. The main ones that US 80 use are SR 540 from the Alabama state line to Geneva and in the eastern part of the Macon metropolitan area; SR 22 from the Alabama state line to Macon; SR 19 from Macon to a point southeast of Montrose; and SR 26 from that point to Tybee Island. From Macon to its Savannah, US 80 roughly parallels I-16, taking a more circuitous route to pass through the center several small towns that I-16 bypasses. Route description The highway crosses the Chattahoochee River from Alabama into Columbus where it proceeds along J. R. Allen Parkway through the northern section of the city as a limited-access freeway. Past Columbus, the road meanders through rural Georgia for roughly en route to Macon where it becomes the Eisenhower Parkway which crosses Interstate 475 (I-475) and then I-75 before traveling through downtown Macon and merging with US 129/US 41 Bus. in a concurrency. The concurrency with US 41 Bus. ends at Walnut Street, and the one with US 129 ends at Riverside Drive. After crossing the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge over the Ocmulgee River, it has another interchange, this time with I-16. The highway joins southbound US 23/US 129 Alt. and parallels the northern boundary of Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park just east of the city. Beyond Macon, the highway turns southeastward, traveling through the cities of Dublin, where it encircles the Laurens County Courthouse. Before the highway leaves Dublin, it is joined by US 319/SR 31, where all four highways cross the Herschel Lovett Bridge over the Oconee River, entering East Dublin, where US 319/SR 31 leaves to the northeast. Later it enters Swainsboro, where it is concurrent with SR 56, and Statesboro where it is concurrent with US 25, and traveling roughly parallel to I-16. On the outskirts of Savannah, the highway crosses I-95 and follows Louisville Road into the city's downtown area. After briefly merging with I-516, US 80 continues eastward along Victory Drive, just south of Savannah's historic district. At the community of Thunderbolt, where Victory Drive ends, US 80 crosses the Wilmington River and proceeds across the islands and marshes along the Atlantic Coast east of Savannah. There it crosses Lazaretto Creek onto Tybee Island. The final stretch of US 80 follows Butler Avenue across Tybee Island. The highway terminates at 19th Street, a few hundred feet from the ocean. A small monument at the intersection of Butler and Tybrisa Street marks the end of the highway. The following portions of US 80 in Georgia are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From the Alabama state line to the SR 96 intersection in Geneva *From the I-475 interchange to the southern end of the US 129 concurrency in Macon *From the northern end of the US 129 concurrency in Macon to the SR 57 intersection in East Macon *The portion between US 441 Byp./SR 117 and US 441/SR 29 in Dublin *From the western end of the US 25/SR 67 concurrency in Hopeulikit to the US 301 Byp./SR 73 Byp. intersection in Statesboro *From the I-95 interchange in Pooler to an indeterminate point in Tybee Island. History In 2017, it was planned to extended Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road (from SR 17's current southern terminus at I-16 to just south of its intersection with the northern terminus of Pine Barren Road). Construction on the extension began in 2018. Future The at-grade intersection at Jimmy DeLoach Parkway's current southern terminus is to be converted into a full diamond interchange. The extension of the parkway is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it is opened. The former alignment of SR 17 is planned to be redesignated as SR 17 Spur. Also, the eastern end of Osteen Road, which lies on the right-of-way of the extension, is to be shifted to the west.

It was previously located at 4 Macclesfield Street. In 1974, it became the first Chinese restaurant in the United Kingdom to be awarded a Michelin Star. The restaurant was referenced in the lyrics of 1978 song \\"Werewolves of London\\" by Warren Zevon. Lee Ho Fook closed in 2008, being replaced by another restaurant called Golden Harvest. That was then replaced by Dumplings' Legend, which specialises in soup-filled dumplings. Reviews A 1968 review of Lee Ho Fook in The Times described it as \\"undoubtedly one of the best new Cantonese restaurants in London\\". One of the three owners of the restaurant, Vincent Tsui told The Times that initially they had not expected their cooking to appeal to English people but found that they had come regularly and that \\"We're not going to make any concessions\\". A small card with the Chinese names of dishes to present to waiters was given to customers who only spoke English. The 1969 edition of The Good Food Guide praised Lee Ho Fook's \\"strikingly individual cooking\\" as \\"the work of an artist\\". William F. Heintz called it \\"one of the top places to dine in all of London\\" in a review for The Chinese-American News Magazine in 1974. In a 1978 review for the New York Times wrote that the food was \\"quite good ‚Ä¶ though it should be characterized as Chinese food for Westerners\\" and praised the \\"sweet and sour pork, beef stir‚Äêfried with peppers and onions, chicken soup with egg drops\\" and \\"Cantonese staple\\" crabmeat soup with corn. The decor was described as \\"a mishmash of Chinese restaurant clich√©s‚Äîpanels embossed with dragons, lanterns, woven bamboo, and with rather cramped seating\\". The waiting service was described as \\"virtually non-existent\\". In culture In the book Dubious Gastronomy: The Cultural Politics of Eating Asian in the USA Robert Ji-Song Ku wrote that Zevon's reference to Lee Ho Fook was emblematic of his perception of the ubiquity of Chinese food in the daily life of British people. The writer and novelist Will Self wrote that he was a fan of Lee Ho Fook for the fact that it was mentioned in Zevon's song. The comedian and writer Rich Hall imagined dining at the restaurant as a werewolf in his 2010 short story collection Magnificent Bastards.

Geography It sits at the top of an imposing hill about 8 miles from Teramo. To the west can be seen the Gran Sasso, the highest peak in the Apennines and to the east lies a plain leading to the Adriatic Sea. History The town dates to pre-Roman Empire times and is rather important in that artifacts of the ancient Piceni and Etruscan tribes have been unearthed in this location. These pieces date back to the 4th century A.C. and are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Chieti. Rapino has an elongated shape with one road, winding through the village center and eventually leading to Teramo. A lesser road connects the village to the nearby state road (SS 150). The lack of an efficient means of reaching the SS 150 has served to greatly increase the village's isolation over the years. The local townspeople have recently increased the pressure on the provincial authorities to upgrade this important byway. Santo Stefano is the main church of the village and was constructed in medieval times. It is best known for a crucifix dating back to the 16th century. Also present is a wooden belltower built in an architectural style reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance. In records dating back to the 11th century mention is made of a castle existing in this area. On 23-24 May 1998 a large reunion was held in Rapino by provincial authorities to celebrate the inauguration of a statue honoring local individuals fallen in all of the wars in which Italy has participated. On 9 October 2007 a town meeting was held at the old schoolhouse of Rapino. A town committee was organized and has since received official recognition by the communal authorities. Initial goals focus on petitioning the commune of Teramo to upgrade the town's transportation links and recreational facilities. Secondary goals include establishing a website for the village, obtaining funds for restoration work on the Chiesa di San Stefano, establishing a high speed ADSL internet connection, and improving the village's sanitary services. Economy Up until the middle of the 20th century, the two most important economic activities in the area included farming and animal grazing.

Hero of the Reconquest He arrived in Buenos Aires at 11 years of age, poor and speaking only Basque. He became a merchant, gaining riches in the slave trade, and selling textiles and firearms. He became a respected member of the community and a politician and member of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, by 1785 as Defender of the Poor. He was one of the founding members of the Consulado de Comercio de Buenos Aires (the equivalent of today's Chamber of Commerce), in 1794. When in 1806 the first British Invasion came to Buenos Aires, he put his fortune at the service of the creole reconquest, organizing a group of conspirators and joining with other groups formed and funded by other prominent merchants, such as S√°enz Valiente and Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n. The invading General Beresford had ordered the confiscation of all arms in civilian's hands, but √Ålzaga who was a specialist in arms smuggling collected hundreds and installed secret gun-repair shops. He rented houses around the main square (Plaza Mayor) in secret, and from there they excavated tunnels to mine the Fort. His organizational skills were notable; he had a strong will and natural leadership, but he was never popular. The wages for the volunteers were paid for by √Ålzaga from his own coffers. He rented the Perdriel Ranch, in present- day San Mart√≠n, where the volunteers trained. The British spy-network only heard about this place a few days before the start of the reaction, and was too late to attack Perdriel, only accelerating the fight for reconquest. When Santiago de Liniers arrived back from Montevideo and started the Reconquest, on 12 August, he was joined by √Ålzaga's secret army, and the British were rapidly defeated. Beresford's surrender came in early and the viceroyalty was saved. Defense of Buenos Aires √Ålzaga convened an open council (cabildo abierto), which removed viceroy Sobremonte from military command, giving it to Liniers, and forbidding Sobremonte's return to Buenos Aires. On January 1, 1807 √Ålzaga was re-elected Mayor and took control of the city government. The British fleet had not left the R√≠o de la Plata, and awaited reinforcements which arrived under command of general Whitelocke. They captured Montevideo in June 1807, easily defeating Sobremonte's forces. √Ålzaga simply ordered the removal of the viceroy and ordered his arrest, replacing him temporarily with Liniers. He participated in the organization of volunteer city militias, and army of more than 6,000 men, and paid for a regiment of Asturians and Vizcayans out of his own funds. On 2 July 1807 the expected invasion came through, and Liniers was defeated at Miserere, on the outskirts of the city. Whitelocke did not pursue the escaping creole army giving his troops three days of rest. √Ålzaga convinced the defeated Liniers on preparing the city's defenses, taking advantage of the respite; organized the defense house-by- house, illuminated the city with oil lamps to continue working through the night and made sure all houses had projectiles and other defensive arms on their roofs. The British resumed their attack on June 5, but made the tactical mistake of coming in separate columns, making it easier for the defenders to defeat them separately. At noon on the 7th, the British capitulated and retreated. √Ålzaga forced general Whitelocke to sign a document that included the surrender of Montevideo. Revolution of January 1, 1809 Liniers and √Ålzaga became the heroes of the day, but soon they had a mutual conflict, as much as by the failed administration by the viceroy, as that Liniers was French and Spain had declared war on Napoleon Bonaparte's France. On January 1, 1809, he organized a revolution to depose Liniers. √Ålzaga took his regiments to the streets (the \\"Gallegos\\", \\"Mi√±ones de Catalu√±a\\" and \\"Vizca√≠nos\\", all Spaniards), organized a protest against the viceroy and tried to force Liniers to resign. In his place he would name a Junta, managed by Spaniards with two Creole secretaries: Mariano Moreno and Juli√°n de Leyva. Liniers resignation was on the condition that military command passed to general Ruiz Huidobro, his second in command. This disconcerted √Ålzaga and gave time for colonel Cornelio Saavedra, commander of the Patricios Regiment. He in turn disbanded the mutinous Spanish forces and forced Liniers to withhold his resignation. This failed revolution was a precursor of the May Revolution the following year and highlighted the conflict lines between the royalist Spanish and the Creoles and produced a schism that was the start of the May Revolution. √Ålzaga was sent to prison to Carmen de Patagones and a trial followed. The mutinous Spanish regiments were disbanded, which eased the way for the May Revolution. The Governor Francisco Javier de El√≠o, in Montevideo, formed a Junta to govern that city and rescued √Ålzaga from Carmen de Patagones. The Junta was disbanded when the new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, arrived in Buenos Aires. √Ålzaga took part in the subsequent revolution against Cisneros the following year, and even though he was not present in the open cabildo of May 22, 1810, he it is known he participated in the negotiations to leading to the formation of the Primera Junta, as he placed three members of his party: Mariano Moreno, Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu. Trial and death On 1 July 1812, the government discovered a plot of Spaniards against the First Triumvirate, whose members Rivadavia, Pueyrred√≥n and Chiclana, prepared to take over on July 5, the fifth anniversary of the defense against the British. During the ensuing investigation, secretary Rivadavia, based on dubious proof and confessions extended the accusations against √Ålzaga and his co-conspirators. √Ålzaga was arrested, tried and condemned to death along with other people. The executions started on July 4, two days after his arrest which raises the suspicion that the trial outcome was previously decided. More than 30 men were executed, including military commanders, merchants and clerics. He was executed on 6 July 1812 in Buenos Aires. The bodies were then hanged and left on the Plaza de la Victoria for three days. Bibliography *David Rock, Argentina 1516-1987 * Wright, Ione S., and Lisa M. Nekhom.

Gladwell defines a tipping point as \\"the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point.\\" The book seeks to explain and describe the \\"mysterious\\" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: \\"Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do.\\" The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990. The book is co-authored by John Decker. The three rules Gladwell describes the \\"three rules of epidemics\\" (or the three \\"agents of change\\") in the tipping points of epidemics. =The Law of the Few= \\"The Law of the Few\\" is, as Gladwell states: \\"The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts.\\" According to Gladwell, economists call this the \\"80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80 percent of the 'work' will be done by 20 percent of the participants\\" (see Pareto Principle). These people are described in the following ways: :*Connectors are the people in a community who know large numbers of people and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who \\"link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together.\\" They are \\"a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [... for] making friends and acquaintances.\\" Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person who understands the concept of the weak tie. Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that \\"their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy.\\" :*Mavens are \\"information specialists\\", or \\"people we rely upon to connect us with new information.\\" They accumulate knowledge, especially about the marketplace, and know how to share it with others. Gladwell cites Mark Alpert as a prototypical Maven who is \\"almost pathologically helpful\\", further adding, \\"he can't help himself.\\" In this vein, Alpert himself concedes, \\"A Maven is someone who wants to solve other people's problems, generally by solving his own.\\" According to Gladwell, Mavens start \\"word-of-mouth epidemics\\" due to their knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate. As Gladwell states: \\"Mavens are really information brokers, sharing and trading what they know.\\" :* Salesmen are \\"persuaders\\", charismatic people with powerful negotiation skills. They tend to have an indefinable trait that goes beyond what they say, which makes others want to agree with them. Gladwell's examples include California businessman Tom Gau and news anchor Peter Jennings, and he cites several studies about the persuasive implications of non-verbal cues, including a headphone nod study (conducted by Gary Wells of the University of Alberta and Richard Petty of the University of Missouri) and William S. Condon's cultural microrhythms study. =The Stickiness Factor= The Stickiness Factor refers to the specific content of a message that renders its impact memorable. Popular children's television programs such as Sesame Street and Blue's Clues pioneered the properties of the stickiness factor, thus enhancing effective retention of educational content as well as entertainment value. =The Power of Context= Human behavior is sensitive to and strongly influenced by its environment. Gladwell explains: \\"Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and places in which they occur.\\" For example, \\"zero tolerance\\" efforts to combat minor crimes such as fare-beating and vandalism of the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes citywide. Gladwell describes the bystander effect, and explains how Dunbar's number plays into the tipping point, using Rebecca Wells' novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, evangelist John Wesley, and the high- tech firm W. L. Gore and Associates. Dunbar's number is the maximum number of individuals in a society or group that someone can have real social relationships with, which Gladwell dubs the \\"rule of 150.\\" Other key concepts Gladwell also includes two chapters of case studies, situations in which tipping point concepts were used in specific situations. These situations include the athletic shoe company Airwalk, the diffusion model, how rumors are spread, decreasing the spread of syphilis in Baltimore, teen suicide in Micronesia, and teen smoking in the United States. Reception=Public= Gladwell and his co-author, John Decker, both received an estimated US$1‚Äì1.5 million advance for The Tipping Point, which sold 1.7 million copies by 2006. In the wake of the book's success, Gladwell was able to earn as much as $40,000 per lecture. Sales increased again in 2006 after the release of Gladwell's next book, Blink. The Guardian ranked The Tipping Point #94 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century. =Scientific= Some of Gladwell's analysis as to why the phenomenon of the \\"tipping point\\" occurs (particularly in relation to his idea of the \\"law of the few\\") and its unpredictable elements is based on the 1967 small-world experiment by social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram distributed letters to 160 students in Nebraska, with instructions that they be sent to a stockbroker in Boston (not personally known to them) by passing the letters to anyone else that they believed to be socially closer to the target. The study found that it took an average of six links to deliver each letter. Of particular interest to Gladwell was the finding that just three friends of the stockbroker provided the final link for half of the letters that arrived successfully. This gave rise to Gladwell's theory that certain types of people are key to the dissemination of information. In 2003, Duncan Watts, a network theory physicist at Columbia University, repeated the Milgram study by using a web site to recruit 61,000 people to send messages to 18 targets worldwide. He successfully reproduced Milgram's results (the average length of the chain was approximately six links). However, when he examined the pathways taken, he found that \\"hubs\\" (highly connected people) were not crucial. Only 5% of the e-mail messages had passed through one of the hubs. This casts doubt on Gladwell's assertion that specific types of people are responsible for bringing about large levels of change. Watts pointed out that if it were as simple as finding the individuals that can disseminate information prior to a marketing campaign, advertising agencies would presumably have a far higher success rate than they do. He also stated that Gladwell's theory does not square with much of his research into human social dynamics performed in the last ten years. Economist Steven Levitt and Gladwell have a running dispute about whether the fall in New York City's crime rate can be attributed to the actions of the police department and \\"Fixing Broken Windows\\" (as claimed in The Tipping Point). In Freakonomics, Levitt attributes the decrease in crime to two primary factors: 1) a drastic increase in the number of police officers trained and deployed on the streets and hiring Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner (thanks to the efforts of former mayor David Dinkins) and 2) a decrease in the number of unwanted children made possible by Roe v. Wade, causing crime to drop nationally in all major cities‚Äî\\"[e]ven in Los Angeles, a city notorious for bad policing\\". And although psychologist Steven Pinker argues the second factor relies on tenuous links, recent evidence seems to uphold the likelihood of a significant causal link.

Development The General Aircraft Corporation was established to build an aircraft designed by Doctor Otto C. Koppen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The aircraft was the G1-80 Skyfarer, a two-seat cabin high-wing braced monoplane with a light alloy basic structure and a mixed steel tube and fabric covering. It had an unusual tail unit, a cantilever tailplane with the elevator mounted on the upper surface of the tail with aluminum endplate fins and no movable rudders. It was powered by a 75 hp (56 kW) Avco Lycoming GO-145-C2 geared air-cooled four-cylinder engine.Engine description The aircraft incorporated aerodynamic control principles covered by patents issued to Fred Weick, an early aeronautical engineer who went on to design and market the Ercoupe. Since it had no rudders (or rudder pedals), it was simpler to fly (it had a single control wheel, which controlled the ailerons and elevator), and was considered spin-proof. The aircraft was certified in 1941 with a placard that stated that the aircraft was characteristically incapable of spinning. It was claimed that an average person could learn to fly the Skyfarer in about an hour. It was anticipated that many aircraft would be ordered and built, but the United States became involved in the Second World War and the Skyfarer program was abandoned after either 17 or 18 examples had been built. The rights and tooling passed to Grand Rapids Industries, who built two aircraft before stopping production.Ercoupe history website The company became a manufacturer of the Waco CG-4A troop glider. Operational history In October 1944, a Skyfarer was used by Alverna Babbs, the first legless pilot to be granted a student pilot's permit, to complete her first solo flight at Lunken Airport. Variants L.W. DuVon and Dr. David O. Kime of Western Union College convinced the type holder Grand Rapids Industries, to give the equipment, tools and one of the finished planes to the college. They then found local investors who formed Mars Corporation in 1945. The aircraft was later licensed as the Mars M1-80 Skycoupe with a 100 hp engine. One example was built and production plans were estimated to be as high as 75 planes in its first year. The glut of aircraft produced after the war left little market for the aircraft. The facility to manufacture the aircraft was sold by 1946. The aircraft NC29030 resides in the Plymouth County, Iowa Historical Museum.

In 1902, she became the only racehorse to win four British Classic Races outright. Breeding Sceptre was bred by Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster at his Eaton Stud in Cheshire and was foaled on 9 April 1899. Her sire, Persimmon, had won The Derby and St. Leger in 1896 and the Eclipse Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup in 1897. Sceptre's dam, Ornament, was sired by the Duke of Westminster's Bend Or and was herself a full sister to Triple Crown winner Ormonde. Racing career The 1st Duke of Westminster died in 1899, and his bloodstock was auctioned. The Duke's trainer, John Porter, wanted the 2nd Duke to buy Sceptre, but was outbid by Robert Sievier, who bought her for 10,000 guineas. Sceptre proved to be a hardy filly. Sievier, who trained her himself for most of her three-year-old season, was in almost constant need for funds, and betting on the filly was one way to keep himself afloat. He ran Sceptre in a number of major races, particularly as a three-year-old, before selling her at the age of four. =1901= Sievier sent Sceptre to be trained by Charles Morton at Wantage. She ran three times at two, winning the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom and the July Stakes at Newmarket before being beaten in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. At the end of the season, Morton became private trainer to Jack Joel, and Sievier decided to train his own horses at a yard at Shrewton in Wiltshire which he leased from John Porter. =1902= Staggeringly by modern standards, Sceptre began her season in the Lincolnshire Handicap with Sievier backing her to win ¬£30,000. She carried 6 stone 7 pounds (41.5 kilograms) but was beaten by a head. She then went to Newmarket and won both the 2,000 Guineas in a then record time of 1 minute 39 seconds and two days later the 1,000 Guineas. Her next target was the Derby but she bruised a foot ten days before the race and finished fourth behind Ard Patrick after being left at the start. Two days later, she won The Oaks. Sievier then ran her in the Grand Prix de Paris, where she was unplaced, and then twice at Royal Ascot, where she was fourth in the Coronation Stakes and won the St. James's Palace Stakes. Sceptre also ran twice at Glorious Goodwood, where she was beaten in the Sussex Stakes on the opening day but won the Nassau Stakes three days later after being galloped on the intervening two days. At the autumn meeting at Doncaster she won her fourth classic, the St. Leger. Sievier ran her again two days later over the same course and distance in the Park Hill Stakes, in which she was beaten. At the end of the season, Sievier sent Sceptre to auction to raise money but she failed to reach her reserve price. =1903 and 1904= Sceptre's four-year-old season began with Sievier making another attempt to win the Lincoln to raise money. She carried 9 stone 1 pound this time and was beaten into fifth place. Sievier then sold her for ¬£25,000 to Sir William Bass, who sent her to Manton to be trained by Alec Taylor, Jr.. She won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot before losing by a neck to Ard Patrick in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park with the 1903 Derby winner Rock Sand behind her in third. Sceptre won her four remaining races in 1903, taking the Jockey Club Stakes, Duke of York Stakes, Champion Stakes and Limekiln Stakes. In her final season, 1904, she raced only three times but was placed in all three, finishing second in the Coronation Cup, and third in the Hardwicke Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup. She retired with 13 victories to her name, worth over ¬£38,000. Sceptre and her second foal, Maid of Corinth (1907) Later life Sceptre changed hands several more times, being owned by Edmund Somerville Tattersall of the Tattersalls family, John Musker and finally Lord Glanely. She produced eight foals (one colt and seven fillies), and although none of her offspring were of her quality, four of her daughters won races. One of them, Maid of the Mist, established a bloodline which could be found in classic winners Relko, April the Fifth and Craig An Eran. She remains the only horse to have won four British Classics outright ‚Äì Formosa won the same four classics as Sceptre in 1868 but dead heated for the 2,000 Guineas. In 1923 after failed attempts to get Sceptre in foal, Lord Glanely sold her to a Brazilian breeder despite the promise when he purchased her that she would remain in his care for the remainder of her life. However, public outcry led Glanely to cancel the sale. Sceptre lived in England until her death in February 1926.

The company mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the United States. Arch Coal is the second-largest supplier of coal in the United States, behind Peabody Energy. the company supplied 15% of the domestic market. Demand comes mainly from generators of electricity. Arch Coal operates 32 active mines and controls approximately 5.5 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves, located in Central Appalachia, the Powder River Basin, Illinois basin and the Western Bituminous regions. The company operates mines in Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, and is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The company sells a substantial amount of its coal to producers of electric power, steel producers and industrial facilities.  History  Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 through the merger of publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc. and privately held Arch Mineral Corporation. Arch Mineral had its origins in 1969, when it was formed as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland Inc.) and the H.L.Hunt family of Dallas, Texas; Ashland Coal was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil. With the completion of the merger, Arch became the leading producer of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States. In June 1998, Arch Coal expanded into the western United States with the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Included in this transaction were the Black Thunder Coal Mine and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming; the West Elk longwall mine in Gunnison County, Colorado; and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operates three longwall mines in Utah. In October 1998, Arch added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Thundercloud, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine.Arch Coal Buys Coal Tract in Wyoming In July 2004, Arch Coal solidified its position as a leading producer of high-Btu, low-sulfur western bituminous coal with the acquisition of the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company and its 161-million-ton reserves. In August 2004, Arch again expanded its position in the Powder River Basin with the acquisition of Triton's North Rochelle mine adjacent to Arch's existing Black Thunder operation. By integrating the North Rochelle mine with Black Thunder, Arch created the premier mine in the nation's fastest growing coal supply region. In September 2004, Arch again added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Little Thunder, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder Coal Mine. In December 2005, Arch Coal sold select eastern assets to Magnum Coal Company to unlock the value of some of its Central Appalachian holdings, sharpened its focus in that region, and strengthened its balance sheet in preparation for future growth. In August 2006, Arch acquired a one-third interest in Knight Hawk Coal, a growing coal producer in the Illinois Basin. In October 2009, Arch acquired Rio Tinto's Jacobs Ranch mine and blended it with Black Thunder Coal Mine in the southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, creating the single largest coal mining complex in the world. In November 2009, Arch acquired the rights to mine 731 million tons of Otter Creek coal reserves in the northern Powder River Basin of Montana. On June 15, 2011, Arch acquired International Coal Group (ICG) and cemented its place as a top five global coal supplier and a top 10 metallurgical coal producer and marketer. In December 2011, Arch Coal became the successful bidder for a 222 million ton federal coal lease known as the South Hilight tract in the southern Powder River Basin. In June 2013, Arch Coal announced the planned sale of its Canyon Fuel Company LLC subsidiary to Bowie Resources, LLC. Canyon Fuel includes the Sufco, Skyline and Dugout Canyon mines in Utah. In January 2016, Arch Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This was stated to be a part of a restructuring aiming at reducing debt by $4.5 billion. On October 5, 2016, Arch Coal emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company won a court approval allowing them to erase almost $5 billion in debt and left bankruptcy with $300 million in cash. Arch Coal resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ARCH. Unsecured creditors and bondholders will receive $30 million in cash along with 6% of the new shares according to court agreements. Bondholders will also have the option to receive either warrants to buy up to 12% of the company's new stock or an additional $25 million cash.  Politics  Arch Coal PAC is named, along with other major coal producers, as a donor to the 2004 election campaign in West Virginia. 2004 was a record-setting year for donations made by the coal industry.Coal companies are big political donors  Competitive status  Arch is number 564 in the 2013 Fortune 1000 list. They are the second largest coal producer in the United States.  Environmental impact = Mountaintop removal in Appalachia = Arch Coal practices Mountaintop removal mining, which is controversial because it reduces the height of mountaintops.EPA Environmental Impact Statement Their West Virginia mining operations in the Appalachian Mountains were the subject of a critical documentary in 2002 on Now with Bill Moyers on PBS. Arch's Dal- Tex mining operations above the town of Blair, West Virginia were the subject of a 1998 U.S. News & World Report story \\"Shear Madness\\" by Penny Loeb.Shear Madness - US News and World Report The story documented the impacts of mountaintop removal on communities close to the mines and their subsequent depopulation. A 1999 lawsuit brought by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Bragg v. Robertson was the first successful citizen lawsuit to stop Arch's proposed mountaintop removal valley fill. The fill would have buried several miles of stream at Pigeon Roost Hollow near Blair, West Virginia. In his ruling for the plaintiffs, Judge Charles H. Haden stated that \\"If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated. No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration...Under a valley fill the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality.\\" As of 2012, the company reported that surface mining in Appalachian mountains accounted for roughly 4 percent of its annual coal production. = Colorado mining = Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups announced a campaign in 2015 against Arch Coal's mine project in the Sunset Roadless Area of Gunnison National Forest. =Mine reclamation= Arch Coal used more than $1 billion in \\"self-bonding\\" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. After Arch Coal declared bankruptcy, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality agreed to accept $75 million in place of the company‚Äôs $486 million in self-bonding liability to the state. = Environmental awareness = Arch Coal‚Äôs subsidiary operations reported a water compliance rate of 99.9 percent over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2012. In 2012, Arch Coal became the first energy company to earn the Conservation Legacy Award from the National Museum of Forest Service History.

The station is owned by Stephens Media Group. History KALE began broadcasting in 1950 on AM 900 kHz and was owned by Yakima Broadcasting Corp. KALE had a Top-40 radio format until the early 1980s when it switched to a more adult contemporary format. The station reached its zenith as an AM station during the early to mid-1970s. The station was consistently at or near the top of the age 18-to-49 ratings block (as well as among teens) and frequently led the market in sales billings. The news department won numerous regional and statewide Society of Professional Journalists awards. KALE's ratings dominance waned as listeners began migrating from AM to FM during the latter 1970s and early 1980s. In the 1970s the station was owned by Sterling Recreation Organization and later was owned by Revitalization Partners, before New Northwest Broadcasters purchased the station. In December 2010, Townsquare Media announced it was acquiring 12 stations owned by New Northwest Broadcasters. Since they were already owners of 11 stations in the Yakima and Tri-city areas they planned to spin off 11 stations once the sale closed. Townsquare was planning to move some formats to new frequencies and some call signs were expected to change as well but in July, 2011, the FCC stopped Townsquare Media's plan to buy 12 Tri-City and Yakima radio outlets from New Northwest Broadcasters. According to the July 30, 2011, Tri-City Herald, \\"An eight-page letter from the FCC to Townsquare released on the agency's website Friday said that proposed use of a divestiture trust was a substantial departure from the kinds of uses previously approved by the commission and dismissed five sets of applications that would have reassigned the radio station licenses.\\"http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2011/07/30/1589145/feds-halt- companys-plan-to-buy.html On November 6, 2011, the Tri-city Herald reported that a Fargo, N.D., radio owner was paying more than $6 million to purchase 12 stations in the Tri-Cities and Yakima currently owned by New Northwest Broadcasters. Ingstad Radio Washington agreed to purchase ‚Äî at a discount ‚Äî more than $16 million in debt owed by Seattle-based New Northwest Broadcasters from a creditor, CIT Group. The Tri-Cities stations included in the sale are: KUJ-FM, a Top-40 hits station; KIOK-FM, a country station; KEGX-FM, a classic rock station; KTCR, talk radio; KKSR-FM, a variety hits station; and KALE, a FOX Sports affiliate. The Yakima stations are: KXDD-FM, a country station; KRSE-FM, a variety hits station; KJOX, an ESPN affiliate; KARY-FM, an oldies station; KBBO, a news radio station and KHHK-FM, a contemporary hit music station. The discounted price for Ingstad is about $6.7 million for all 12 stations. According to the Tri-City Herald on May 15, 2012, the station switched to a \\"Country Legends\\" classic country format with the sports programming being moved to sister station AM 1340. KALE's broadcast studios were initially at the transmitter site at Road 68 in Pasco, Washington. The studios then moved to 218 W. Kennewick Ave., Kennewick, Washington. In 1978 the studios moved again to 310 W. Kennewick Ave. when KALE's FM station, KIOK, FM 94.9, was licensed and began broadcasting. The site at 310 W. Kennewick Ave. was the former site of the historic Benton Theatre which, at the time of the move, was also owned by Sterling Recreation Organization.

Laffilard says that \\"...recognizing that his son had spirit and drive, his father Jean sent him to Paris, entrusting him to Pierre de Casamajor, a physician from his province, to teach him the ins and outs of government officialdom so as to be able to acquire a favourable position within it. The doctor placed him with a Solicitor to the Councils where he quickly learned the ropes. In 1731 he then introduced him to his friend Pierre de Forcade, at that time First Commissioner of the Colonial Office, who took an immediate liking to him and hired him as a clerk in his office. French colonial affairs fell within the purview of the Ministry of the Marine at that time, since the navy was the only conduit of supplies. Little by little, De La Porte made himself known to the Minister, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Maurepas, and to Joseph Pellerin, a former Commissioner of the Marine and now Minister of State, who enjoyed Maurepas' entire confidence. With Pellerin's protection and influence, over the next five years he rose within the office, and was promoted in 1736 to First Scrivener and then to Commissioner of the Marine year later.\\" This was about as high as someone not born into a great noble house could hope rise, and doing so within such a short span of time and at thirty, (even with a powerful patron),) is a testament to his talent and drive. Patron and prot√©g√© became family on January 23, 1737 when in Versailles, at the age of twenty-one, Arnaud married Pellerin's daughter Marie-Anne. Portrait of Madame de La Porte by Jean-Marc Nattier Canada On the 17th of June 1738, he succeeded Pierre de Forcade as First Commissioner of the Colonial Office. The Intendant of New France (the Civil Governor of Canada), Gilles Hocquart, had travelled back from Quebec to France to plead with the Ministry of the Marine to underwrite the expansion of agriculture and industry there as he judged that there was too little financial capital or expertise available locally. De La Porte, relatively inexperienced, was inclined to trust colonial administrators on matters relating to the areas they governed and so was convinced by Hocquart's arguments. As a result, the Ministry reversed its former policy of austerity and released a half-million livres between 1737 and 1741 for agricultural and industrial development in Canada. A remarkable economic explosion soon followed, with the Saint-Maurice Forge (the oldest operating steel mill in North America when it finally closed down in 1883), beginning to produce on a larger scale and shipbuilding flowering into an export industry. Canadian local prosperity followed naturally from all this, and the volume of trade increased by 40% in a decade, while exports doubled. As the king's money flowed in, Hocquart's web of patronage and influence increased apace, much to the detriment of the (military) Governor-General, Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, who saw his own r√¥le shrinking proportionally. In that day, both in the colonies and in France, the patronage system obtained, which meant that connections with those in a position to grant contracts and allocate resources was everything. Complex webs of support developed around those in power, not always entirely by what we today would judge to be ethical means. This sort of backroom dealing was tolerated by all involved as long as it didn't go ‚Äútoo far‚Äù although it seemed that the only way of discovering just how far was too far seemed to be to go there...and get caught. Beauharnois, increasingly marginalised, decided to remove his rival once and for all and encouraged local magnates to petition the Ministry for a review of his activities. As a result, Arnaud's younger brother Jean de La Porte, sieur de Lalanne was dispatched to Quebec to investigate these rumours of financial irregularities. The visit of Monsieur de Lalanne, was anticipated with quite a bit of apprehension. Pierre Hazeur de L‚ÄôOrme, representative of the chapter of Quebec at Paris, informed his brother, Joseph-Thierry Hazeur, at Quebec, of La Porte's mission, adding that everyone in Canada, ‚Äúimportant or unimportant,‚Äù should pay court to Jean for ‚Äúhe could well one day come to hold a high position.‚Äù As Commissaire Enqu√™teur (Commissioner of the Marine acting as special investigator in Canada) he was empowered to audit all accounts, take depositions from all interested parties, hear complaints and accusations and generally to try to get to the bottom of the scandal, if there was indeed a scandal, for there was already, even before his dispatching, a suspicion that the charges of corruption imputed against Hocquart were in fact fabrications (or at least exaggerations) intended to discredit him, conjured up by his enemy and rival, Governor de Beauharnois. La Porte arrived at Quebec in the early autumn of 1740, in time to help Hocquart prepare the annual financial dispatches. Hocquart reported that ‚Äúhe has begun to go into much of the routine. I think that he will certainly profit from his time in Canada. He is fortunate to have been born with great natural ability. . .‚Äù Whether he accepted Hocquart's advice to visit the Saint-Maurice ironworks that winter is not clear, but he did inspect them on his way to Montreal the following summer. None of his views on the colonial administration has survived, but the very absence of serious repercussions for Canadian officials following his return to France in 1741 suggests that he was reasonably satisfied. Then too, Hocquart, who left nothing to chance, was careful to send him off bathed in praise. Monsieur de Lalanne's two years in New-France was the first time anyone in the family had set foot in Canada, but he kept an eye out for lucrative colonial enterprises in which he might wish to acquire an interest for himself and his family. Hocquart's fine opinion of the La Portes soon changed when it became apparent that Jean was using his recently acquired familiarity with the Canadian economy for private benefit. On 17 April 1744, the Count de Maurepas informed Canadian officials that Jean de La Porte was to be given the ‚Äúfur farm‚Äù (la ferme sur la traite des fourrures, i.e. the profits on the taxing of the fur trade) of Lac Alemipigon (Lake Nipigon, Ontario) from that year forward, as a reward for his services in New France. In a letter dated a week later, Maurepas confirmed that the La Porte brothers had received also a warrant granting them five-sixths of the fishery of Baie de Ph√©lypeaux (Baie de Brador, Que.) on the death of the current proprietor, Fran√ßois Martel de Brouage. Revenues from the whole concession had been more than 55,000 livres in 1741. Both Beauharnois and Hocquart resisted these metropolitan intrusions, asserting that the colonial inhabitants who developed such enterprises should reap their benefits. But Hocquart's successor, Fran√ßois Bigot, proved more cooperative. Arnaud de La Porte became a key figure in the ‚ÄúGrande Soci√©t√©‚Äù, acting as Bigot's protector in the office of the colonies. The de La Porte family's fortunes waxed thanks to this, but however frustrating to the locals it might be for distant and powerful officials back in France to be reaping the benefits of their labour, it was entirely in keeping with the usage of the day. The measured exploitation of the financial rewards their situation afforded them was the unspoken norm among high government officials (both in France as in England, c.f. the toleration of the contemporaneous Fox there). No doubt Arnaud in particular had Canadians‚Äô interest sincerely at heart, but Jean's r√¥le in New-France faded soon after his posting, around 1750, as Commissioner at Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, where the La Portes also had extensive private investments). Arnaud was a vigorous and involved figure at the central government with regard to New France,however as is evidenced by the rich correspondence between him and the Governors and Intendant who followed Hocquart. Unfortunately, circumstances beyond the good intentions of those on the spot and La Porte in Versailles conspired to bring this initially rewarding boom in Canada to a disappointing end. Incompetent administration of the forge, then three successive years of bad harvests and finally the French declaration of war with England in 1744, which led to naval blockades that annihilated trade until 1748. Meanwhile, Arnaud's prot√©g√© Fran√ßois Bigot went on to serve as Intendant of New-France during increasingly difficult times for the colony. Pressure was rising from the combined efforts of the British and the Americans to disrupt trade. Inflation was making it harder for the common colonist to survive, let alone prosper, and when the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756, the situation in Canada became chronically critical. This however did not stop Bigot during his dozen-year intendancy, with a small group of wealthy and powerful locals called the ‚ÄúGrande Compagnie‚Äù, from making a profit. By all the usual venal means typical of the Bourbon administration, but brought to a fine art and exploited beyond the usual degree, they continued to line their pockets while providing a better-than-average administration, especially considering the catastrophic times they faced. Many were the complaints filed against them from the outset, whether from jealous outsiders resentful of being excluded from the ‚Äútake‚Äù or from more legitimate quarters, but the government made not the slightest move to investigate them. No doubt the powerful La Porte, back home at Versailles, was in on the deal as well, but lest one be too hasty in judging these officials‚Äô probity, it is essential to view the situation within its historical context, not because Bigot was innocent of the accusations brought against him but because the Bourbon administration in general was founded upon venality, patronage, and corruption of just the kind he was accused of (his virtuoso performance aside). It would not be until after the French Revolution that the standards of public honesty we have come to expect would come into being. While Bigot may well have been too greedy even for his day, had New-France not fallen to the British when it did, it is very unlikely he would have ever faced prosecution. In the event, the British conquest of New France brought an end to all these manoeuvrings and Bigot soon after his return home to France was made to stand trial on corruption charges. Because the government badly needed a scapegoat, and because the enormous costs of the unsuccessful Seven Years' War, among other things, had brought it dangerously near bankruptcy, it was necessary to find him guilty which the court duly did, simultaneously repudiating as ‚Äútainted‚Äù the Crown's over 18 million livres of debt to the colonists, many of whom thus found themselves now not only conquered but ruined as well. Known to history as the ‚ÄúAffaire du Canada‚Äù this scandal, along with the government's listless reaction to the British conquest, went a long way towards permanently souring relations between the conquered colonists and the French back home. As one of them would later say, they were forced to ‚Äúremain French despite France‚Äù. Arnaud de La Porte was not implicated in any wrongdoing, and in any case he had, after an immensely successful twenty-year career at the Ministry of the Marine, taken his retirement, on January 27, 1758. Patron of science He had, during his long tenure there, also had influence in other spheres as well, in particular in the advancement of science (this was, after all, the Age of Enlightenment). In a letter dated 1742 by the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, 1707-1788, whom Darwin a century later called ‚Äúthe first modern author to treat evolutionary ideas in a scientific spirit‚Äù, to a correspondent who had been sending specimens from his posting in Cayenne to Buffon's Jardin du Roi (the modern Jardin des Plantes, Paris), asking for additional funding for his work there, wrote ‚ÄúI have successfully petitioned an augmentation for you of 300 livres for which you are obliged to Monsieur de La Porte whose lively interest in the sciences led him to support your and my claims before Monsieur le Comte de Maurepas...and since he [La Porte] has the direct protection of our Cabinet of Natural History, which is currently very flush and in an enviable state, you would, Monsieur, do well to pay him your court‚Äù.

The nobility of the de La Porte family dates from this year. After twelve years of service at the Chambre des Comptes, Arnaud de La Porte died in office on the 21st of March 1770 at 64 years of age. Heirs and family Arnaud de La Porte was survived by two daughters and four sons, and all of the latter entered the public sphere. Arnaud II briefly achieved the position his father had never been able to attain of Minister of the Marine, and during the Revolution was called by his beleaguered king to oversee counterrevolutionary activities from his new post as Intendant of the Civil List (manager of the king's private funds), an endeavour which would cost him his life in 1792 when he became the Revolution's second victim of the guillotine. Jean-Victor took over his father's last position at the Chambre des Comptes and emigrated at the Revolution, serving first in the artillery of the Army of the Princes in Germany, and after its disbanding going into exile in England, living in London for a decade before returning to France during the Napoleonic Regime. Ferdinand was appointed bishop of Carcassone by Napoleon and was granted the title of Baron by him, and finally Arnaud-Joseph became a Councillor of State under Louis XVIII. Louis XVIII, on his ascension in 1814, granted the hereditary title of Baron to the son of the guillotined Arnaud Jr. in recognition of the services he had performed for the King during the Revolution, and for his ultimate sacrifice. After the bishop's death, his nephew inherited his Napoleonic baronial title as well as the royal one, thus becoming doubly a baron, but when he died without male heirs both titles passed to Jean-Victor's branch, where they continue to reside to this day.

In the ten-year span of its known life, the Bennett BTC-1 was identified in print by four different names: the Bennett, the Breese Bennett, the Bowlus Bennett and the Globe BTC-1. Design The BTC-1 was conceived by the aviation entrepreneur F. C. \\"Bub\\" Merrill. He sensed there was a need for an airplane with competitive performance; an appealing price; smaller, less expensive engines; and made of low cost wooden construction, with little need for expensive tooling. Unfortunately, Merrill did not have the financial resources to turn his concept into reality.Skyways p. 14 In late 1935, he turned to Frank C. Bennett, then President of Bennett Oil Corporation, President of Federal Oil of Houston, Texas, and Vice-President of Bennett Oil and Gas of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Merrill's choice of Bennett as an investor was no accident or stroke of luck, as he knew that it was common for oil companies to invest in the development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill's convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin- engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck. Using Belgian chemist Dr. Leo Baekland's patented carbolic acid and formaldehyde phenolic resin compound marketed as \\"Bakelite\\", Dr. Robert Nebesar patented a process where bakelite-bonded fine grain plywood was formed under pressure and heat to produce a strong light weight curved panel. The process was marketed under the trade name \\"Duraloid.\\" Merrill's original concept called on Nebesar's patented Duraloid shapes to form the BTC-1 monocoque fuselage and tail surfaces. The combination of the skills of Baekland and Nebesar made possible the development of what can be considered the forerunner of today's composite aircraft. Merrill put together a team of aircraft designers and builders to put his plan into action. Art Mankey from the Glenn L. Martin Company was Chief Engineer, Walter Chaffee, from Douglas Aircraft, a qualified test, and William Hawley Bowlus of San Fernando, California the designer and builder of gliders and sailplanes since 1911 which were mostly constructed using bent and formed wood.Skyways p. 15 Bowlus constructed his aircraft at his Ranch in San Fernando, which was equipped with the equipment to make structurally strong light weight and graceful shapes for world class high performance sailplanes. The BTC-1 offered a challenge to Bowlus but he had the reputation and skills as the premier plywood former in the aviation industry. Bowlus, Breese and Mankey had worked at Ryan Aircraft. Bowlus was the factory manager in the production of the Ryan NYP Spirit of Saint Louis. Mankey was a contributing engineer there and Breese was the test pilot of the company's products. When the BTC-1 was completed it was partially disassembled and trucked from San Fernando a short distance to the Van Nuys airport. The BTC-1 was reassembled and Van Breese began flight testing. On one of the first few flights the landing gear would not extend, so Breese made the landing wheels-up. The Duraloid skin and wooden structure sustained little damage. The result of the belly landing was remarkable as the damage was limited to the two bent Hamilton Standard Propellers and the aluminum cowling and landing gear doors. On November 1, 1937 the Bennett BTC-1 received approval number 2-552 from the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and the aircraft was officially registered as N18690. They had a certificated airplane, but no factory or sales. With a total of $100,000.00 invested, Bennett and Merrill began a sales campaign directed to cities already exhibiting interest in aviation.Skyways p. 18 Among those cities was Fort Worth, Texas, where in 1936, the Bennett Aircraft Company located its new operation. Two more individuals play an important part in the development of the BTC-1. The first was Airport Manager and Aviation Director, William \\"Bill\\" Fuller. Fuller was an attendee at one of the presentations given by Bennett and Merrill. Second was John Clay Kennedy, who, after a lengthy career in the cattle and beef industry, settled in Fort Worth. He was a partner in a medical pharmaceutical company called Globe Laboratories. Kennedy bought the rights to a serum to immunize cattle from a disease called \\"Black Leg,\\" an acute anaerobic bacterial disease fatal to most infected animals. Sales of the serum made Kennedy a millionaire. He sold out and retired in 1930, spending eight years raising horses and traveling. By 1938 he was looking for an enterprise to keep him busy. In a chance meeting with Bill Fuller, Kennedy confided his desires to Fuller. Fuller told Kennedy about the Bennett Corporation and in a short time the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware, passed into history, when on April 9, 1940 the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Texas was born. The incorporators were Bennett, Kennedy and the owner of a large Fort Worth insurance agency, H. E. Brants.Skyways p. 20 No orders were placed for the aircraft and no production aircraft were built. With nothing but expenses on the horizon, the Bennett Corporation declared bankruptcy and went out of the business in 1940. Late in 1940, John Clay Kennedy, the principal stockholder in the Bennett Aircraft Corporation, emerged from the bankruptcy as the owner of the assets of the firm. Kennedy then formed the Globe Aircraft Company in 1941. He also ended up with the BTC-1 which was renamed the Globe BTC-1. Construction Three-quarter front view The BTC-1 followed the basic design criteria of the 1930s for light transport aircraft. The American design philosophy of the time evolved around twin-engine, six to eight passenger, monocoque monoplanes. Airframe construction of the time was typically all- metal duraluminum with flight control surfaces covered with fabric. Favored engines were Jacobs, Wright and Pratt-Whitney in the 230 to 450 Horsepower range, per side. The one constant in the aviation industry at the time was escalating cost, which has continued to today.Skyways p. 21 The Bennett was built using two low cost methods, horsepower versus weight and materials advancement. The principal structural material was Duraloid, a plywood impregnated with resin and processed under a patented process. If the design criteria proved successful the BTC-1 could fly at competitive speeds with less power and at lower manufacturing costs. =Fuselage= The internal fuselage structure of the BTC-1 was of built-up frames with alignment and load transfer through routed stringers. The Duraloid outer skin was bonded to this internal structure. It is not possible to determine the number and disposition of parting lines of the fuselage skin. However, if William Hawley Bowlus followed his own standard practice, entire sides from upper to lower center lines would have been molded as one piece. The average thickness of the skin would have been one quarter inch with additional laminations providing attaching points for the internal structure. Given the overall use of Duraloid throughout the airframe components it is reasonable to believe the bonding was accomplished using the Bakelite-based resin. When the two fuselage halves were mated and fully skinned, they were covered with a lightweight fabric covering material. In 1936 it would have been either cotton or linen doped over the Duraloid skin. Clear nitrate was used to bond and fill the fabric covering. The filling of the fabric weave would have been accomplished by mixing extra fine sawdust with the clear dope sanded smooth to the desired finish. This same process was followed throughout the aircraft. Many comments were made on the outstanding finish of the product. The interior layout of the fuselage suffered from the same obstruction as some of the earlier Lockheeds. The main spar and its related hump virtually separated the cockpit from the main cabin. This required two different entry doors, both requiring over-wing access.Skyways p. 22 =Wings= Given Bowlus's penchant for consistency, all-Duraloid construction is the most likely as there is no photographic or descriptive text indicating the wing to have been other than a fully monocoque cantilever structure. The main spar of the wing was fabricated as a full span tapered box. To this box spar was attached a formed leading edge forming a full span D-cell. The ribs were bonded to the aft face of the spar and to the upper and lower wing skins. This method of assembly would have resulted in a strong, light structure. The flap structure followed the same format as the wing and the aileron structure varied only in being fabric covered. =Empennage= The vertical fin and horizontal stabilizers were fixed cantilever structures. The design followed the same practices as the wing structure, with additional thickness at the leading edge of the stabilizers as protection from ground damage. The rudder and elevators were of the same construction as the ailerons. Trim tabs were adjustable from the cockpit. Vance Breese was primarily referred to as the test pilot, but he was also acknowledged as a contributing designer of the Executive. The empennage of the BTC-1 was almost certainly a Breese design. When compared with the configurations of the Breese-Dallas, the Vultee model V-1, and the Vultee model 51, which became the BT-13 and 15, the planforms and ratios are virtually the same. Breese engineering skills contributed to all of those designs. =Powerplant= The Executive was equipped with two 285 horsepower Jacobs seven cylinder L-5 radial engines. However, the performance figures quoted by the Bennett group were based upon anticipated performance of the aircraft using Jacobs 300 horsepower L-6 engines. Sales information provided also mentions anticipated use of the Wright R-760-E Whirlwind of 350 horsepower. There is no record of installation of either of the larger engine choices. The propellers were two- bladed Hamilton-Standard controllable pitch or constant speed units as an option. The engines used welded steel tube engine mount of 4130 Chrome- Molybdenum tubing and flat stock. It is reasonable to assume that load bearing members of the mount system extended far enough to transfer the torsion and tension loads into the main wing 3structure.Skyways p. 23 =Landing gear= The fully retractable main landing gear were welded steel and flat stock structures with single fork mounted Goodyear low pressure tires. The majority of the landing loads were absorbed through air-oil struts providing eight inches of travel. Landing gear retraction was hydraulically powered by an engine driven pump, or with emergency extension by gravity and a manually operated hand pump in the cockpit. The aircraft was equipped with a full swiveling tail wheel. There is no mention of the auxiliary wheel being retractable. =Accommodations= The cockpit and passenger cabin were separated by the main wing spar. The cockpit had seating and controls for two; however, the right hand controls were noted as being easily removable, allowing a seventh passenger in lieu of the additional pilot. The passenger cabin provided seating for six in various configurations. There were provisions for luggage stowage in the aft cabin and in a smaller compartment in the nose of the aircraft. =Doors= Entry into the cockpit and passenger cabin were from the upper surface of the wing center section. Access was through bi-fold doors latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage. =Finish and appearance= The aircraft was painted in overall cream with trim lines and number in red. The outstanding appearance was of its smooth skin and excellent finish, a virtual trademark of William Hawley Bowlus.

The basic concept is that the smart antenna either physically rotates toward the signal, or is stationary, but has elements pointed in different directions and uses only those elements that maximize the received signal. This is accomplished by feedback from the control device, such as a digital-to-analog converter box, telling the smart antenna when the signal is stronger or weaker. Analog televisions generally give instant feedback as the signal gets better or worse as you move the antenna. Digital television antennas can be difficult to aim correctly because of the cliff effect and because of delays in decoding and displaying the signal. Smart antennas remove the burden of positioning the antenna for digital TVs and can make the tuning process easier than it was with analog television.  Information from TVP9900 document  There are two basic modes of operation for a CEA-909 antenna, mode A and mode B. Mode A allows for communication only from the tuner to the antenna and Mode B allows for bidirectional communication. A 14-bit pulse-width modulation data stream is sent to the antenna and if the antenna is mode B a 10-bit data stream is sent back. The timeout period for a response from a mode B antenna is 100 ms. The system uses a single wire for communication, possibly similar to I¬≤C. The 10 bits sent back from the antenna are largely unused. Only the first two bits are used with at least one of those being used for a transmission error flag; the remaining 8 bits are reserved. The contents of the 14 bits sent to the antenna are not revealed.  Revision CEA-909-A  CEA-909-A is an update to CEA-909 that enables a single coaxial cable to connect smart antennas to smart antenna-capable DTV sets. A weakness of CEA-909 was that it required another control cable in addition to the coaxial cable. This revision was first approved by the Consumer Electronics Association R4 Video Systems Committee on 6 June 2007 and ANSI public review closed on 1 October 2007. After editorial review, it was published in December 2007.  Revision CEA-909-B  The CEA R4 Video Systems Committee published this update in September 2010. Purchase price for the full publication is $81.  CEA-909A data timing specification Mode A The data timing of the specification is divided into 125 Œºs symbol periods between 5 VDC for V_Hi and 0 V for V_Low. The PWM Logic 0 is V_Hi for the first 41.7 Œºs followed by V_Low for the rest of the symbol period while Logic 1 is V_Hi for the first 81.3 Œºs (V_Low for the rest). The preamble should send V-Hi for three periods then V_Low for one period then a logic 1 start bit. The 14-bit data breaks down sequentially as follows: Two bits for coarse direction or switching control, MSB sent first. Two bits for fine direction control, MSB sent first. One bit for polarization control Two bits for preamp gain. The state 1,1 shall be maximum gain, state 0,0 minimum gain, and remaining states progressing monotonically. 7 bits for RF channel number (per CEA-542-B ), MSB sent first. (Note: this could allow for channel assignment from 0 to 127, but it is artificially limited to the range 2‚Äì69 and the post-transition channel range will be 2‚Äì51) After the data is sent the system should send V_Low for 1 period and wait until next RF channel change (with a minimum of 10 ms between data streams to allow for the antenna controller logic to reset). This means channels should be able to change and reset as fast as every ‚âà12.5 ms (‚âà80 Hz) or every channel in 0.85 seconds and with 16 'virtual' antennas (32 with two polarization states).  Limited Choice of EIA/CEA-909A Smart Antennas in the Marketplace After the above rigorous, seven year standardization process by the Consumer Electronics Association leading up to the deployment of ATSC Digital television in the United States on June 11, 2009, two smart antenna models were brought to market: * RCA ANT2000 -- no longer available from retailers * DTA-5000 -- sometimes associated with the Sylvania brand name; no longer available from retailers And two models are causing consumer confusion: * Although the Apex SM550 is capable of connecting to a CEA-909 port for the purpose of drawing electrical power, it is not a true smart antenna. * The unfortunately-named Channel Master 3000A SMARTenna is a conventional antenna, not a smart antenna. The United States National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) ran a coupon-eligible converter box (CECB) subsidy program for the ATSC conversion, but did not subsidize the purchase of a smart antenna to mitigate the cliff effect of digital television, and many CECBs do not support smart antennas.  Official specs  The official specifications are available for purchase from Global Engineering Documents.

The station was situated at the southern end of Station Road which still exists. The station was later operated by the London Midland and Scottish Railway and was closed by the London Midland Region of British Railways on 3 July 1961. The main station building was a substantial brick- built structure located on the east (southbound) side of the line. A footbridge led across the twin railway tracks to the northbound platform which was provided with a smaller brick-built shelter. Station staff could use a wooden boarded crossing at the north end of the facility. Train services The station was served by local trains from Manchester Central to Cheadle Heath and to Stockport Tiviot Dale; also by secondary stopping trains from Derby. These continued to run after the closure of the station until 1967, with line closing to all traffic two years later.

It is the first chartered hospital to have been founded in the city of Pittsburgh and it is also the first hospital in the world to have been established by the Sisters of Mercy. It is also the first teaching hospital in the region, accepting residents to teaching positions beginning in 1848, one year after opening its doors. In January 2008, Mercy Hospital merged with Pittsburgh health care giant UPMC, taking on its current name UPMC Mercy. UPMC Mercy remains Pittsburgh's only Catholic hospital that provides a full breadth of specialized services. History The Sisters of Mercy, a religious congregation founded in Ireland in 1831 by Catherine McAuley, brought its stated mission of caring and compassion to the growing industrial city of Pittsburgh in 1843. Mother Frances Warde led six other sisters to the United States, where they founded the first congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh. The pioneering \\"Seven Sisters\\" of Mercy opened the first permanent hospital in Pittsburgh, and the world's first Mercy Hospital, on January 1, 1847. Founded by Bishop Michael O'Connor, it began life in a temporary frame building on Penn Avenue known as Concert Hall. The hospital they established was open to all regardless of race, nationality, age, gender, or religion. Mercy established the region's first teaching hospital with resident physicians in training in 1848. Mercy Hospital viewed from across the Monongahela River Mercy Hospital grew rapidly with Pittsburgh in the second half of the nineteenth century. To qualify for new funding sources, the hospital was incorporated, a board was established, and Thomas M. Carnegie was elected board president. The Sisters of Mercy and the physicians and nurses of Mercy Hospital continued to serve the Pittsburgh region through World War I, the worldwide epidemic of Spanish influenza, the Great Depression, and World War II. One of the most compelling examples of the hospital's service to the community occurred in 1931 when Mercy Hospital donated more than $600,000 ($ today) worth of health care services at a time when one day in the hospital cost less than $4 ($ today). That commitment to the community was demonstrated again when, in the 1960s, Mercy decided to rebuild and remain in uptown Pittsburgh, and over the next four decades, the hospital expanded, replaced facilities, and developed specialized programs and advanced technology. In 2006, Mercy Hospital decided to seek a strategic partner to strengthen and preserve its faith-based care and Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh merged with UPMC to become UPMC Mercy on January 1, 2008. The hospital remains Pittsburgh's only Catholic hospital with specialized services, including the neurosciences, Level I trauma and burn services, women's health, orthopaedics, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. Mission From its inception in 1847, the hospital has welcomed and served all who are in need of its services regardless of race, nationality, age, gender or religion. UPMC Mercy continues to provide significant amounts of unreimbursed healthcare to the poor and uninsured in Pittsburgh and to the entire Western Pennsylvania region. The Mission of the hospital includes \\"a commitment to being a transforming, healing presence within the communities we serve\\". Core values UPMC Mercy embraces the following seven \\"core values\\" that are at the heart of its daily operation: # Reverence for each person, # Community support, # Justice for all, # Commitment to those who are poor, # Stewardship, # Courage, # Integrity. As a Catholic hospital, UPMC Mercy will not provide or permit medical procedures that are contrary to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, thus not providing some procedures available at other UPMC facilities. Major programs UPMC Mercy Hospital is a Level I Trauma and Burn Center, a major neurosurgical center, and a major cardiovascular treatment center that also has recently acquired unique expertise and advanced technology for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke and neurovascular disorders. UPMC Mercy provides inpatient Behavioral Health services, on both a General Adult unit and a Dual Diagnosis unit. Level 4A Medically Managed Inpatient Detox services have been offered at UPMC Mercy since January 2010, as a result of the closure of UPMC Braddock that month. Although both Level 4A (Medically Managed) and Level 3A (Medically Monitored) Inpatient Detox had been available on the UPMC Braddock premises, Level 3A services are not available at UPMC Mercy. It also incorporates a fully accredited and internally contained 76-bed rehabilitation center for the treatment of various forms of pathology producing physical disabilities, with specialty rehabilitation programs that address acquired brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, and Limb Amputation. UPMC Mercy Hospital offers physician residency training programs in the fields of General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Podiatry, Physical Medicine and Rehab, and Pharmacy. Helipad at UPMC Mercy Internal Medicine Residency Program Internal medicine residency program is the largest residency program of the institution, with more than 50 first, second and third year categorical residents. The program director is Dr. Anthony J Pinevich. The program includes rotations at UPMC Mercy Hospital and the Mercy Health Center. Prominent patients Ben Roethlisberger is a past patient. In a statement released on June 15, 2006 through the Pittsburgh Steelers organization following his treatment at Mercy Hospital for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident in downtown Pittsburgh on June 12, 2006, Mr. Roethlisberger included the following acknowledgment: \\"The physicians and support staff at Mercy Hospital were simply amazing, and I will forever be grateful for their caring treatment.\\" In March 1983, Pittsburgh Penguins coach/GM and Pittsburgh Hornets legend Baz Bastien was rushed to the hospital after crashing into a motorcycle on Interstate 376 in suburban Greentree, Pennsylvania.

Longer conveyors and screw-fed cementitious materials slow down production significantly. A concrete plant, also known as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors. The heart of the concrete batching plant is the mixer, and there are many types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a comparatively large batch of concrete mix. In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe and other parts of the world, a Twin Shaft Mixer is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, as well as from the aggregate batcher to the charge chute. A Twin shaft Concrete Mixer Which most common in Concrete Plants The aggregate batcher also named as aggregate bins, is used for storage and batch the sand, gravel and crushed stone of the concrete plant. There are also many types of aggregate batchers, but most of them measured aggregate by weighing, some use the weighing hopper, some use the weighing belt. The cement silos are an indispensable device in the production of concrete. It mainly stores bulk cement, fly ash, mineral powder and others. There are 3 types of cement silos, bolted cement silos, Horizontal cement silos and integrated cement silos. Integrated cement silos made in factory, it can be used directly. Bolted cement silo bolted for easy installation and removal. Horizontal cement silos have lower requirements on foundations and can be transported by truck or flatbed without disassembly. Cement Silos The screw conveyor is a machine to transfer the materials from the cement silos to the powder weighing hopper. Screw Conveyor Concrete plant use the control system to control the working of the machine. concrete batch plants employ computer aided control to assist in fast and accurate measurement of input constituents or ingredients. With concrete performance so dependent on accurate water measurement, systems often use digital scales for cementitious materials and aggregates, and moisture probes to measure aggregate water content as it enters the aggregate batcher to automatically compensate for the mix design water/cement ratio target. Many producers find moisture probes work well only in sand, and with marginal results on larger sized aggregate. Automatic Control System  Types  There are many classification standards for concrete plants. Concrete Plant can be divided into dry mix plant and wet mixing plant depending on whether a central mixer is used. It can be also divided into stationary concrete plant and mobile concrete plant depending on whether can be moveable. = Dry mix Concrete Plant = A Dry mix Concrete Plant, also known as Transit Mix Plant, weighs sand, gravel and cement in weigh batchers via digital or manual scales . All the ingredients then are discharged into a chute which discharges into a truck. Meanwhile, water is either being weighed or volumetrically metered and discharged through the same charging chute into the mixer truck. These ingredients are then mixed for a minimum of 70 to 100 revolutions during transportation to the jobsite. = Wet mix Concrete Plant = A Wet mix Concrete Plant, combines some or all of the above ingredients (including water) at a central location into a Concrete Mixer - that is, the concrete is mixed at a single point, and then simply agitated on the way to the jobsite to prevent setting (using agitors or ready mix trucks) or hauled to the jobsite in an open-bodied dump truck. Dry mix differ from Wet mix plants in that Wet Mix contain a central mixer whereas dry, which can offer a more consistent mixture in a shorter time (generally 5 minutes or less). Dry mix plants typically see more break strength standard deviation and variation from load to load because of inconsistencies in mix times, truck blade and drum conditions, traffic conditions, etc. With a Central Mix plant, all loads see the same mixing action and there is an initial quality control point when discharging from the central mixer. Certain plants combine both Dry and Wet characteristics for increased production or for seasonality. le A Mobile batch plant can be constructed on a large job site.Concrete Batch Plant Modeling Guide. IowaDNR.gov = Mobile Concrete Plant = The mobile batch plant, also known as a portable concrete plant is a very productive, reliable and cost effective piece of equipment to produce batches of concrete. It allows the user to batch concrete at most any location then move to another location and batch concrete. Portable plants are the best choice for temporary site projects or even stationary locations where the equipment height is a factor or the required production rate is lower. = Stationary Concrete Plant = The stationary concrete plant is designed for produce high-quality concrete. It has the advantages of large output, high efficiency, high stability and high specification. Stationary Concrete Batching Plant adopts reliable and flexible , it easy to maintenance and owning a low failure rate. It is widely used in various projects such as roads and bridges, ports, tunnels, dams and buildings.  Application  Typical concrete plants are used for ready mix, civil infrastructure, and precast applications. = For Ready Mix = The global Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) market is valued at US$394.44 Billion in 2017 and is expected to reach US$624.82 Billion by the end of 2025, growing at a CAGR of 5.92% between 2016 and 2022.Ready Mix Concrete Market Worth 624.82 Billion USD by 2025 The Concrete Plant for Produce Ready Mix Concrete is also called as Ready Mix Concrete Plant, it is generally located inside the city, transporting ready-mixed concrete for the projects through concrete truck mixers. Ready Mix concrete plants have higher requirements for durability, reliability, safety and environmental protection of the concrete plant's system. = For Precast Applications = The Precast concrete, also named as a PC component, is a concrete product that is processed in a standardized process in the factory. Compared with cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete can be produced, poured and cured in batches. At the same time, the precast concrete batching plant has the safer construction environment, lower cost, and high quality products; the construction speed can be guaranteed. In addition, it is widely used in transportation, construction, water conservancy and other fields. Across the globe, Precast & Prestress operations are industry giants. Precast & Prestress producers can be credited for supplying the utmost critical segments utilized for world-wide infrastructure to include buildings, bridges, parking decks, road surfaces, retaining walls.  Dust and water pollution  Municipalities, especially in urban or residential areas, have been concerned at the pollution by concrete batching plants.Concrete Batching Plant Pollution. u-forest.ca (March 30, 2016) The absence of suitable dust collection and filter systems in cement silos or at the truck loading point is the major source of particulate matter emission in the air. The loading point is a large emission point for dust pollution, so many concrete producers utilize central dust collectors to contain this dust. Notably, many transit mix (dry loading) plants create significantly more dust pollution than central mix plants due to the nature of the batching process. A final source of concern for many municipalities is the presence of extensive water runoff and reuse for water spilled on a producer's sites.

The territory ceded by Poland in red, territory ceded by USSR in green. The 1951 Polish‚ÄìSoviet territorial exchange or Polish- Soviet border adjustment treaty of 1951 was a border adjustment signed in Moscow between the Soviet-imposed People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union regarding roughly of land, along their mutual border. The agreement was signed on February 15, 1951 and ratified by People's Republic of Poland on May 28, 1951 and USSR May 31, 1951. It modified the border treaty of August 16, 1945 and entered into force on June 5, 1951. The exchange was made to the decisive economic benefit of the Soviet Union due to rich deposits of coal given up by Poland; these deposits were discovered well before World War II.Sylwester Fertacz, Krojenie mapy Polski: Bolesna granica. Alfa. Retrieved from the Internet Archive on 14 November 2011.J.A.S. Grenville, The major international treaties, 1914‚Äì1973. A history with guide and text. Taylor & Francis. 572 pages. Within eight years following the agreement, the Soviets built four large coal mines there with a total annual mining capacity of 15 million tons.Bogdan Kawa≈Çko, \\"Prostowanie granicy.\\" Dziennik Wschodni, 2006-02-03. Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça ZarzƒÖdzania i Administracji w Zamo≈õciu. In exchange, the Soviet Union ceded part of the Ukrainian SSR's Drohobych Oblast (1939‚Äì1959): the city of Ustrzyki Dolne and the villages of Czarna (Ukrainian: Chorna), Shevchenko (whose name was restored to prewar Polish name Lutowiska in 1957), Kro≈õcienko, Bandr√≥w Narodowy, Bystre and Liskowate. All of this territory became part of the Krosno Voivodeship in 1975, and of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship on 1 January 1999. It was a stretch of Ustrzyki deposits of oil. Poland gave up part of the Lublin Voivodship, with the cities of Be≈Çz (Ukrainian: Belz), Uhn√≥w ( Uhniv), Krystynopol ( Chervonohrad) and Warƒô≈º (, Varyazh). All of this territory is now part of the Sokal Raion (), Ukraine. After World War II, the territory of Poland changed dramatically, moving westwards. Poland gained the former German provinces of Silesia and Pomerania, with the eastern part of Brandenburg and the southern part of East Prussia. The eastern border of the country was established roughly along the Curzon Line, leaving Bia≈Çystok in Poland and Lviv in the Soviet Ukraine. The border of Poland and the Soviet Union, delimited on the 1945 agreement remained almost unchanged until the early 1950s (with a minor correction in 1948, when the village of Medyka near Przemy≈õl was transferred to Poland). Then, rich deposits of coal were confirmed in the so-called Bug River knee ‚Äì Polish postwar territory between the upper Bug and the So≈Çokija River. The Soviet government decided to gain control over this land, which possessed not only coal but also fertile black soil. Negotiations The Government of the People's Republic of Poland formally asked the government of the USSR to exchange a small border section of Poland with an equivalent border section of the territory of the USSR. In the political conditions of the time, the USSR's indication of the areas on the Bug and Solokiya was a wish that should have been accepted without discussion. During the negotiations held in Moscow in January and February 1951, both delegations tried to increase the value of the territory as much as possible. Initially, the Russians proposed to replace almost the entire Tomaszowski and Hrubieszowski Poviats along with the bend, remembering the rich forests and oil in the Bieszczady Mountains. The deputy minister of foreign affairs at the time was the well-known geographer Stanis≈Çaw Leszczycki, who discreetly advised against such an exchange, reminiscent of a bazaar \\"machniom\\" rather than a fair transaction. Thus, the Poles rejected the original version of the agreement and, although Leszczycki was dismissed from his post at the end of 1950, the deal was to concern only the knee of the Bug in exchange, for which Poland was about to receive a piece of the Bieszczady Mountains with the only \\"metropolis\\" Ustrzyki Dolne. The Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrentev constantly emphasized that the USSR is giving Poland lands of great natural wealth. He also diminished the significance for the USSR-Ukraine of the railway line from Kovel to Lviv.Bieszczady 1951. Akcja H-T 1951 To the opinion of Polish negotiators about coal resources in this area, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister Korniyets, participating in the talks, replied that the research done at the border gave very poor results. And yet coal was known before the war. Initially, it was established that Poland should pay the difference resulting from a higher valuation of the territory surrendered by the USSR. Polish negotiators did not agree to such a solution, they were faced with the fact that it meant Poland's resignation from Ni≈ºankowice, Dobromyl and Chyr√≥w. To Zawadzki's remark that this would cause that the railway line leading to Ustrzyki Dolne, which would be in Poland, would run through the territory of Ukrainian SSR, the Soviet Union did not react at all. Agreement concerning the exchange On 15 February 1951, the governments of the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union signed a bill that ratified the change of the eastern border of Poland. According to the agreement, Poland transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of territory located west of the town of Sokal, which had been located in the Hrubiesz√≥w county of the Lublin Voivodeship (together with the towns of Be≈Çz, Krystynopol and Uhn√≥w as well as the rail line Rawa Ruska - Krystynopol). These towns are now located in the Sokal Raion of the Lviv Oblast. Several coal mines have been constructed there, and the former town of Krystynopol is now known as Chervonohrad. According to the agreement, all real estate left behind in the exchanged territories, such as infrastructure, buildings, farms, and rail lines, were automatically transferred to the new owner and both sides relinquished all future claims. Moveable goods were allowed to be kept by private individuals under the condition that the owners had to take them when they left. The Polish population of the Sokal area was transferred in May 1951, mainly to the Recovered Territories. The inhabitants of the town of Belz (now, Western Ukraine) settled in Ustrzyki Dolne. Officially, the Polish side declared that the exchange took place on the Warsaw's initiative. However, in the early 1950s, Poland was de facto ruled by the Soviet Union and all pertinent decisions were made by Joseph Stalin. Results And indeed as a result of the exchange on the railway route from Zag√≥rz to Przemy≈õl, PKP trains will pass through the territory of the USSR-Ukraine. They were closed and escorted by commuters inside with dogs and border guards standing on the steps of the wagons. The idea of obtaining oil resources in that area was quite doubtful. Polish geologists were well aware that the offer referred to small pond resources similar to those in the vicinity of Krosno, Jas≈Ço and Gorlice. They were described quite accurately on geological maps, and production at 85 tons per day did not have a significant impact on the volume of Polish imports of this raw material. Even though the territory ceded to Poland was roughly as large as the territory transferred to the Soviet Union, the land around Ustrzyki Dolne lacked industry, natural resources and fertile soil. On top of that, it was already depopulated during the 1947 Polish-Soviet Operation Vistula. In 1968‚Äì69 the Polish government of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka completed the hydro-electric Solina Dam, long, and high, on the San river, which created Lake Solina. The territory is now part of Bieszczady County (Subcarpathian Voivodeship).  Plans of next exchange  In November 1952, Soviet rulers wanted to exchange new territories with bigger parts of the land, both counted and were inhabited by more than 100,000 people. Poland had to lose large parts of Hrubiesz√≥w and Tomasz√≥w counties with town Hrubiesz√≥w, due to Soviet plans of expanding of the coal industry but had to gain part of Drohobych Oblast with town Khyriv (Chyr√≥w) and whole railway Przemy≈õl-Zag√≥rz, separated by Polish-Soviet border in 1945. The plans of second exchange were abandoned due to Stalin's death on March 5, 1953, and never realized.http://rcin.org.pl/Content/46399/WA303_62493_A507-DN-R-26-3_Tebinka.pdf See also * Territorial changes of Poland after World War II * Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union * Curzon Line * Kresy * List of national border changes since World War I * History of the Ukrainian minority in Poland ** Repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to USSR (1944-1946) ** Operation Vistula * Polish minority in Ukraine ** Repatriation of Poles (1944‚Äì1946)#From Ukraine ** Repatriation of Poles (1955‚Äì1959) References * Agreement (with Protocol and annexes) concerning the exchange of sectors of Poland and USSR territories.

Life and career =Early years= Oudin was one of six brothers born in New York City to French parents, Lucien and Sophie Agnus Oudin. He sang as a boy soprano in the choir of Dr. Tyng's church in New York City and studied music under Moderati. Oudin showed talent and was eventually entrusted with the baritone solos at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church. He studied Law at Yale University and was admitted to the Bar in 1879, joining the offices of the legal firm Evart, Southmayd and Choate. In 1881 he set up in legal practice for himself and continued this work for three years, until he accepted an offer to join the American Opera Company, singing for them several times in the western United States. Travelling to Europe in May 1886, Oudin met fellow New Yorker Lady Randolph Churchill in London, who set him up as a salon singer, during which period he appeared before British aristocracy, including The Prince of Wales.New York Times obituary, November 5, 1894 =Opera and concert years= Oudin made his operatic stage debut in New York as Montosol in Josephine Sold by Her Sisters at Wallack's Theatre in August 1886 under the direction of John A.

It is best known for the nearby Keem Bay, a Blue Flag beach. Dooagh beach Between May 2017 and January 2019, Dooagh beach had 300 metres of golden sand. Previously, the sand was completely washed away in a storm in 1984, leaving a rocky foreshore that remained until the sand was restored by an unusually high tide in April 2017. The new sandy beach was reported as causing an increase in tourism to the village. Dooagh beach washed away for a second time in early 2019. Transport=Road= Dooagh is located on the R319 regional road. Bus √âireann route 440 (Dooagh‚ÄìWestport‚ÄìIreland West Airport Knock) operates once a day on weekdays in each direction. Expressway route 52 provides an evening journey each way to/from Westport and Galway. =Rail= The nearest rail services are at Westport railway station approximately 62 km away. There are several trains a day from Westport to Dublin Heuston via Athlone. Facilities Dooagh has a number of bed and breakfast establishments and self-catering apartments. There are two public houses, Lourdie's and Gielty's Bar and Restaurant, which sometimes host traditional Irish music sessions. The bar and nightclub in the Wavecrest Hotel is open seasonally. Places of interest The road to the west of Dooagh leads over Croghaun Mountain to Keem Strand, which has views over Clew Bay. A turning off the Keem Road leads to Lough Acorrymore, surrounded by scree slopes and now dammed to supply water for the entire island. The seaward side of Croghaun has high cliffs, the island's highest. On the road from Dooagh beach towards Lough Corrymore stands Corrymore House, once the home of Captain Charles Boycott, a British land agent whose ostracism by his local community in Ireland as part of a campaign for agrarian tenants' rights in 1880 gave the English language the verb \\"to boycott\\", meaning \\"to ostracise\\". Captain Boycott moved to Corrymore House after his residence at Keem was burnt down. The American artist Robert Henri also lived there at one time, having bought the house in 1924. In the centre of Dooagh is a monument to Don Allum, the ocean rower who was the first to row across the Atlantic in both directions, and who completed this feat on reaching Dooagh village near to this point. Culture Achill has five pipe bands, Dooagh Pipe Band being one of these. Dooagh Pipe Band was founded on 17 March 1947 with a membership of eleven. Scoil Acla, an Irish traditional music summer school, takes place annually in Dooagh. Scoil Acla was established in 1910. Artist Paul Henry was an active member of Scoil Acla and in 1912 directed the play Casadh an t-Sugain (The Twisting Of The Rope) by Douglas Hyde. The school gradually went into decline, but was revived in 1985. Education Dooagh National School serves the Dooagh, Pollagh and Keel areas, and has 36 pupils and two teachers. The school was built in 1959 and renovated in 2001. Achill Archaeological Field School is based at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of archaeology and anthropology.

It is formed from ice Ih by compressing it at a temperature of 198 K at 300 MPa or by decompressing ice V. When heated it undergoes transformation to ice III. Ordinary water ice is known as ice Ih, (in the Bridgman nomenclature). Different types of ice, from ice II to ice XVIII, have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures. It is thought that the cores of icy moons like Jupiter's Ganymede may be made of ice II. History The properties of ice II were first described and recorded by Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann in 1900 during his experiments with ice under high pressure and low temperatures. Having produced ice III, Tammann then tried condensing the ice at a temperature between under of pressure. Tammann noted that in this state ice II was denser than he had observed ice III to be. He also found that both types of ice can be kept at normal atmospheric pressure in a stable condition so long as the temperature is kept at that of liquid air, which slows the change in conformation back to ice Ih. In later experiments by Bridgman in 1912, it was shown that the difference in volume between ice II and ice III was in the range of . This difference hadn't been discovered by Tammann due to the small change and was why he had been unable to determine an equilibrium curve between the two. The curve showed that the structural change from ice III to ice II was more likely to happen if the medium had previously been in the structural conformation of ice II. However, if a sample of ice III that had never been in the ice II state was obtained, it could be supercooled even below ‚àí70 ¬∞C without it changing into ice II. Conversely, however, any superheating of ice II was not possible in regards to retaining the same form. Bridgman found that the equilibrium curve between ice II and ice IV was much the same as with ice III, having the same stability properties and small volume change. The curve between ice II and ice V was extremely different, however, with the curve's bubble being essentially a straight line and the volume difference being almost always .

Las Soledades (Solitudes) is a poem by Luis de G√≥ngora, composed in 1613 in silva (Spanish strophe) in hendecasyllables (lines of eleven syllables) and heptasyllables (seven syllables). G√≥ngora intended to divide the poem in four parts that were to be called \\"Soledad de los campos\\" (Solitude of the fields), \\"Soledad de las riberas\\" (Solitude of the riverbanks), \\"Soledad de las selvas\\" (Solitude of the forests), and \\"Soledad del yermo\\" (Solitude of the wasteland). However, G√≥ngora only wrote the \\"dedicatoria al Duque de B√©jar\\" (dedication to the Duke of B√©jar) and the first two Soledades, the second of which remained unfinished. From the time of their composition, Soledades inspired a great debate regarding the difficulty of its language and its mythological and erudite references. It was attacked by the Count of Salinas and Juan Mart√≠nez de J√°uregui y Aguilar (who composed an Antidote against the Soledades). The work, however, was defended by Salcedo Coronel, Jos√© Pellicer, Francisco Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (Abad de Rute), the Count of Villamediana, Gabriel Boc√°ngel, and overseas, Juan de Espinosa Medrano y Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. Rafael Alberti would later add his own Soledad tercera (Par√°frasis incompleta)Argos 16/ Ensayo/ Guadalupe Mercado The first novel of John Crowley's Aegypt series is named The Solitudes and the G√≥ngora poem is read by the protagonist, and is referenced throughout the plot.

It travels west to east in the north-central part of the state, starting at the Alabama state line, west of Tallapoosa, where the roadway continues concurrent with the unsigned highway Alabama State Route 4\\\\. This is also the western terminus of Georgia State Route 8 (SR 8), which is concurrent with US 78 to the east. The highway serves the Atlanta, Athens, and Augusta metropolitan areas on its path from the Alabama state line to the South Carolina state line, at the Savannah River, on the northeastern edge of Augusta, where it continues concurrent with US 1/US 25/US 278/SC 121\\\\. This is also the eastern terminus of SR 10 and the northern terminus of SR 121, as well as the southern terminus of SC 121\\\\. US 78 travels through portions of Haralson, Carroll, Douglas, Cobb, Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Walton, Oconee, Clarke, Oglethorpe, Wilkes, McDuffie, Columbia, and Richmond counties. Various portions of the highway, from the Alabama state line into Atlanta, were part of the historic Bankhead Highway, a cross-country automobile highway connecting San Diego and Washington, D.C.. It was part of the National Auto Trail system. US 78 also is a freeway for about 10 miles. It is the main route of the freeway. It has about 8 exits. Route description=Alabama to Mableton= US 78 begins at the Alabama state line, west of Tallapoosa, where the roadway continues to the northwest, concurrent with the unsigned Alabama State Route 4 (SR 4). Southeast of here in Haralson County, US 78 travels concurrent with Georgia State Route 8 (SR 8), which also begins at the state line. They travel just to the south of Wards Lakes, East Wards Lake, and the East Wards Lake Dam, and cross over Sanders Creek. Approximately southeast of the creek, US 78/SR 8 cross over the Tallapoosa River on the Bently Bridge. About later, they curve to the east-northeast. Then, they enter Tallapoosa's city limits, where they have a very gradual curve to the east. In the main part of town, they have an intersection with SR 100 (Robertson Avenue), which joins the concurrency for a few blocks, until it turns off onto Alewine Avenue. Here, the concurrency curves to the east-southeast. Just before leaving town, US 78/SR 8 intersect the northern terminus of SR 100 Spur before crossing over Greene Creek. Immediately, upon leaving the city limits, they pass the Helton Howland Park and the Tally Valley Park. Upon passing Pine Grove Cemetery, they are northeast of Tally Mountain; then, they curve to the southeast, passing through Budapest. After crossing over a Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line, the two highways curve to the east-southeast and enter Waco. In the main part of town, they curve to the east-northeast and leave the city limits. Immediately, they enter Bremen. Just after the city limits, they pass just south of Antioch Cemetery and intersect US 27/SR 1 (Martha Berry Highway). A few blocks later, they pass northwest of Bremen City Cemetery and Higgins General Hospital. In the main part of the city, they cross over an NS line and intersect US 27 Business/SR 1 Business (locally known as Alabama Avenue to the south and Hamilton Avenue to the north). Just before intersecting Bryan Street, the highways begin to curve to the east-southeast. They cross over Buck Creek, and begin a very gradual curve to the east-northeast, shortly before leaving the city limits. North of the Mangham Lakes, US 78/SR 8 begin to curve to a nearly northeast routing. Just after crossing over Chance Creek, they curve to the east-southeast and enter Carroll County and the city limits of Temple. In Temple, US 78/SR 8 pass just south of Easterwood Lake before they cross over Webster Creek. Slightly more than later is an intersection with the western terminus of SR 274 (James Street) and the northern terminus of Centerpoint Road. Right after this, the two highways slightly shift to a nearly due-east routing. Almost after SR 274 is an intersection with SR 113 (Carrollton Street). About a block and a half later, the two highways pass just south of Temple High School. Immediately after the school is the eastern terminus of SR 274 (Sage Street), which circles around the SR 113 intersection. Just to the east of Oak Shade Road, the concurrency curves to the northeast. They begin a gradual curve back to the east-southeast, cross over Trestle Creek and leave the city limits. After a slight jog to the north, they curve to the southeast and cross over the Little Tallapoosa River. Approximately later, they curve to the east-southeast and then enter Villa Rica. In the main part of the city, US 78/SR 8 curve to the east-northeast and intersect SR 101 (locally known as Industrial Boulevard to the south) and SR 61, the latter of which joins the concurrency. The three highways pass Hill Crest Cemetery before a fairly sharp curve to the southeast. At Carroll Road, SR 61 departs the concurrency to the northeast. The highways curve to the east-northeast and enter Douglas County. US 78/SR 8 curve back to the east- southeast and very briefly travel due east. During this section, they intersect the northern terminus of SR 8 Connector (Liberty Road). Almost immediately, they curve to the east-northeast before curving back to the east- southeast and leaving the city limits. After a brief northeast routing, they curve to a nearly due-east direction and back to the east-southeast, north of Andy Mountain. They head southeast and curve back to the east-northeast, traveling through Winston, and passing Winston Elementary School. US 78/SR 8 travel due east to an intersection with the southern terminus of Polk Road, where they begin to curve to the east-northeast. They travel through White City, curving back to the northeast. After a very brief jaunt to the east, the concurrency curves to the east-northeast and enters Douglasville. In town, they intersect SR 5 (Bill Arp Road), which joins the concurrency. In downtown, they travel just south of Worthan Park a few blocks before intersecting SR 92, which also joins the concurrency. The four highways travel together for two blocks, where SR 92 splits off onto Mozley Street. US 78/SR 5/SR 8 leave the city limits and pass northwest of Beulah Elementary School. They pass Sunrise Memorial Gardens and curve to the east-northeast just before entering Lithia Springs. In town, they travel north of Penns Lake and curve to the east. They curve to the northeast and back to the southeast, before curving back to the northeast and intersecting US 278/SR 6 (Thornton Road). At this intersection, US 278 joins the concurrency, which travels to the north-northeast. They pass Louise Suggs Memorial Park and intersect Line Street, where they enter Cobb County and the city limits of Austell. US 78/US 278/SR 5/SR 8 travel one block to the east of Rose Hill Cemetery. Just north of Rosehill Street, they make a slight tilt to the north-northwest before a nearly 90-degree curve to the right, then traveling to the east-northeast. The four highways travel just south of Collar Park. They cross over Sweetwater Creek on the Dr. J.A. Griffith Bridge. Just over later, SR 5 departs the concurrency to the north. The other three highways cross over Butternut Creek and enter Mableton. They travel in a roughly eastern direction before curving to the east-southeast and passing the Austell Campus of Chattahoochee Technical College and Davis Chapel Cemetery. They curve to the northeast, and pass northwest of Sky View Elementary School, before beginning to curve back to the southeast. At this point, they are south of Mableton Elementary School and Mableton Memorial Gardens. After an intersection with the western terminus of SR 139 and the southern terminus of Floyd Road, they travel just south of Lions Park. After a curve to the east, they pass Harmony‚ÄìLeland Elementary School and Lindley Middle School. They curve to the southeast, passing Mt. Harmony Cemetery and Cobblestone Creek Pond, before crossing over Nickajack Creek on the Coogan Ray Bleodow Memorial Bridge, where they leave the city limits. The three highway continue to the southeast and cross over the Chattahoochee River into Fulton County and the city limits of Atlanta. =Atlanta area= From nearly the very moment that US 78/US 278/SR 8 enter the county, they are southwest of the Atlanta Industrial Park. The travel through the former location of the Bankhead Courts, a government housing complex. On the southeast corner of the industrial park is English Park and an intersection with the northern terminus of SR 70 (Fulton Industrial Boulevard NW). Less than later is an interchange with Interstate 285 (I-285; Atlanta Bypass). The concurrency travels through the Brookview Heights neighborhood, southwest of Carey Park and Williams Elementary School. A short distance later, they intersect SR 280 (locally known as Hamilton E. Holmes Drive to the south and James Jackson Parkway NW to the north). After curving to an eastern routing, the three highways pass Center Hill Park. At an intersection with the southern terminus of Hollywood Road NW, the concurrency curves to the southeast. They travel through Grove Park, passing Edwin Place Park, Grove Park Elementary School, and Woodson Elementary School. They curve to an easterly routing and cross over Proctor Creek. US 78/US 278/SR 8 travel through Buckhead, passing Maddox Park, just south of the Fulton County Jail. The three highways intersect US 19/US 41/SR 3 (Northside Drive NW) at an intersection that doesn't have any signage on the eastbound lanes. All six highways travel concurrently to the southeast for about . Along this stretch, drivers can see the Atlanta skyline. US 19/US 41/SR 3, along with US 29 southbound, travel in a due-south direction. At the same time, US 78/US 278/SR 8, along with US 29 northbound, travel to the east. The four highways curve to the northeast and begin skirting along the northern edge of downtown as they travel underneath multiple NS rail lines and Marietta Street NW, north of the Coca-Cola headquarters, before curving back to the east. They travel just south of Georgia Tech, before crossing over I-75/I-85 (Downtown Connector). About later, they begin skirting along the northern edge of the Bank of America Plaza. This is about one block south of the AT&T; Midtown Center and Fox Theatre. At the corner of Peachtree Street is the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. At the intersection with Piedmont Avenue NE, the four numbered highways turn left onto Piedmont for one block and turn to the right onto Ponce de Leon Avenue. Three blocks later, at the intersection with Argonne Avenue NE, US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8 begin to skirt along the northern edge of Ponce de Leon Center. A few hundred feet later, they intersect Boulevard NE. They travel under a footbridge that carries the Eastside BeltLine Trail. Just to the east of the intersection with Bonaventure Avenue NE, the highways skirt along the northern edge of Freedom Park and intersect SR 10 (Freedom Parkway), which joins the concurrency. On the southeast side of the intersection is an entry point for the Freedom Park Trail and, less than later, is another entry point. At the intersection with North Highland Avenue NE, is the Plaza Theatre and Druid Hills Baptist Church. About a block and a half later, they intersect US 23 (Moreland Avenue NE) and SR 42 (Briarcliff Road NE). Here, US 23 joins the concurrency. At this intersection, the six highways enter DeKalb County. =DeKalb County= US 23/US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8/SR 10 curve to the northeast, traveling between Springdale Park on the south and Springdale Park Elementary School and Howard School on the north. On the northwest corner of Brightwood Park, they pass St. John's Lutheran Church; then, they curve to the southeast and pass The Paideia School. A short distance past Fairview Road NE, they pass the Lullwater Estate, which is on the north side of Shady Side Park. After that, they skirt along the southwestern edge of the Druid Hills Golf Club. Just past Clifton Road NE, they begin to skirt along the northeastern edge of Dellwood Park before entering Druid Hills. On the eastern edge of the park, the concurrency is just south of the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. They cross over Lullwater Creek before beginning to skirt along the southern edge of Deepdene Park. At approximately the midway point of the park, US 278/SR 10 split off onto East Lake Drive NE, while US 23/US 29/US 78/SR 8 continue to the east, before curving to the north-northeast. Southeast of Fernbank Forest, the four highways curve back to the east and pass under a CSX railroad. They then curve to the northeast and cross over Peavine Creek before entering Decatur. After traveling through a mostly residential part of the city, they intersect SR 155 (Clairemont Avenue). Here, US 23 turns left, while US 29/US 78/SR 8 continue to the northeast. Less than after the northeastern intersection of Parkside Circle, the three highways enter North Decatur. At the intersection with DeKalb Industrial Way, they begin to travel between North Decatur and Scottdale. Shortly after intersecting Orion Drive, they cross over the South Fork Peachtree Creek. Less than later, US 78, concurrent with SR 410 splits off to the east-northeast (known as Stone Mountain Freeway), while US 29/SR 8 travel to the north-northeast on Lawrenceville Highway. This is an incomplete interchange, as there is no access from US 29/SR 8 south to US 78/SR 410 east or vice versa. This is on the southeast corner of North DeKalb Mall. Approximately later is an incomplete interchange with Valley Brook Road and North Druid Hills Road. The city limits of Scottdale pass through this interchange. The freeway crosses over the South Fork Peachtree Creek then under McClendon Road. After that, they cross over the creek again before reaching the Richard F. Sams Interchange with I-285 (Atlanta Bypass). At the Montreal Road overpass, the freeway begins to travel along the Clarkston‚ÄìTucker city line; then, they skirt along the southeastern edge of Tucker, before entering Tucker proper within the interchange with Brockett Road and Cooledge Road. Just northeast of this interchange, US 78/SR 410 travel just to the northwest of Idlewood Elementary School. Shortly before the Idlewood Road overpass, they begin to curve to a nearly due-east routing. The freeway crosses over the South Fork Peachtree Creek again. At this point, they skirt along the southeastern edge of the city limits and leave the city altogether within the interchange with Mountain Industrial Boulevard. Just before the end of this interchange, the freeway begins a gradual curve to the east-southeast before curving to the southeast. After going under the Juliette Road overpass, they have an interchange with SR 10 (Memorial Drive). At this interchange, SR 410 ends, and SR 10 begins to travel concurrently with US 78\\\\. Within the interchange, the roadway curves to the east-northeast. Almost immediately after the interchange, the freeway passes under the Silver Hill Road overpass and begins to skirt along the northwestern edge of Stone Mountain Park. A short distance later, they cross over Stone Mountain Creek, travel just to the north of the Stone Mountain Park Dam‚ÄìNorth Dam and Stone Mountain Park Lake‚ÄìNorth, and have an interchange with the southern terminus of SR 236 (Hugh Howell Road). Here, the roadway enters Stone Mountain Park proper. The freeway crosses over Little Stone Mountain Creek before the westbound and eastbound lanes diverge from each other. The eastbound lanes curve to the southeast and meet an interchange with the main entrance of Stone Mountain Park. At this interchange, they curve back to the northeast and meet the westbound lanes again, just before leaving the boundary of the park and entering Gwinnett County. =Gwinnett County to Athens= Almost instantly, US 78/SR 10 enter Mountain Park. They have an interchange with West Park Place Boulevard and Rockbridge Road. The latter is only listed on westbound signage. The freeway crosses over West Park Place Boulevard on the Forrest L. Adair II Memorial Bridge and curves to the east-northeast. After this interchange, Stone Mountain Freeway ends and the numbered highways continue to the east- northeast. At an intersection with Camp Circle SW and Pucketts Road SW, the concurrency leaves Mountain Park. After a curve to the northeast, they curve back to the east-northeast and travel south of Lake Lucerne and the Opossum Lake Dam, before crossing over the Yellow River. They intersect the northern terminus of SR 264 (Bethany Church Road) and the southern terminus of Killian Hill Road at the erroneously termed Cpl Jonathan Ryan Akers Memorial Interchange. The concurrency passes Eternal Hills Cemetery; then, they enter Snellville, where they intersect SR 124 (Scenic Highway) at the James D. Mason Memorial Interchange. Here, US 78/SR 10 curve to the east-southeast and pass the Snellville Historical Cemetery. Almost immediately, they travel about one block north of Britt Elementary School. Just past the intersection with Skland Drive SW and Wisteria Drive SW, they pass South Gwinnett High School. Just past the school, the highways curve to the east-northeast. A little over later, they curve to the east-southeast. At an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 84 (Grayson Parkway) and the northern terminus of Rockdale Circle, they curve back to the east-northeast and travel north of Amitriain Lake. At an intersection with Crestview Drive, the two highways leave Snellville proper and skirt along the edge of the city limits for about , where they leave the city altogether. On the northwest corner of Rosebud Park, they curve to the east-southeast. After traveling south of Tuggle Lake, they enter Loganville. In the city, they curve to the south-southeast. Just over after intersecting Logan Drive, US 78/SR 10 enter Walton County. (After the highway was expanded to four lanes in 1985 and rerouted near the Walton/Gwinnett border, the unexpanded portion formerly part of US 78 was renamed Logan Drive.) In downtown Loganville, the concurrent highways intersect SR 20 (Main Street). They curve to the east-southeast and intersect SR 81 and the northern terminus of Cown Drive. At this intersection, SR 81 joins the concurrency. At Lee Byrd Road's southern terminus, SR 81 splits off to the south-southeast. US 78/SR 10 leave the city limits and cross over Big Flat Creek. They enter the city limits of Between and curve to the southeast. Right after leaving town, they curve to the east-southeast, and, approximately after intersecting the eastern terminus of Sardis Church Road, they curve to the east-northeast. Then, they curve back to the east-southeast and cross over the Alcovy River. A short distance after the river, US 78/SR 10 bypass the main part of Monroe on a freeway bypass. Their first exit is with the western terminus of SR 10 Business (West Spring Street). The bypass begins to curve to the east-northeast. Approximately after that interchange is the eastern terminus of SR 138\\\\. Less than after that is an interchange with SR 11 (North Broad Street). The two highways curve back to the east-southeast. Approximately later, they curve to the northeast have an interchange with the eastern terminus of SR 10 Business (East Spring Street), where the freeway bypass ends. Part of the highway is known as the Moina Michael Highway, named for Moina Michael, an American professor and humanitarian who conceived the idea of using poppies as a symbol of remembrance for those who served in World War I. US 78/SR 10 cross over Jacks Creek and intersect the northern terminus of SR 83 (Unisia Drive). Approximately after leaving Monroe, they travel through a rural area of the county and cross over the Apalachee River into Oconee County. US 78/SR 10 continue to the northeast and intersect SR 53 (Hog Mountain Road). They curve to the east before curving to the north-northeast. They intersect Mars Hill Road (former SR 209) just before an interchange with US 29/SR 8/SR 316 (University Parkway), as well as the western terminus of US 78 Business. At this interchange, US 78 begins a concurrency with US 29/SR 8/SR 316 to the east-southeast; meanwhile, US 78 begins, concurrent with SR 10\\\\. The four highways travel south of Jennings Mill Country Club and curve to the southeast briefly. Just before intersecting the Oconee Connector, they begin a gradual curve to the east-northeast. They meet an interchange for SR 10 Loop (Athens Perimeter Highway) and the southern terminus of Epps Bridge Parkway. Here, US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10 Loop begin to travel concurrently to the east-southeast, while SR 316 meets its eastern terminus. Immediately after they curve to the southeast, the concurrent highways travel just north of Robinson Cemetery. They curve to the northeast and then to the east-northeast and have an interchange with US 129/US 441/SR 15 (Macon Highway) and the southern terminus of Timothy Road. In the western part of the interchange, Athens Perimeter Highway crosses over McNutt Creek into Clarke County and the city limits of Athens. =Athens‚ÄìClarke County= US 29/US 78/US 129/US 441/SR 8/SR 10 Loop, plus the unsigned SR 422, that is the hidden reference route numbering for the Athens Perimeter Highway, form one of the concurrencies in the state with seven component highways. They curve to the east-southeast and cross over the Middle Oconee River. Approximately later, the seven-highway route curves to the northeast and passes south of Athens Memorial Park. They have an interchange with the southern terminus of SR 15 Alternate (Milledge Avenue) northwest of the University of Georgia Golf Course. In the eastern part of the interchange, they cross over an NS rail line. They skirt along the southeastern edge of Oconee Forest Park, curving to the north-northeast. On the northeastern edge of the park, the concurrency has an interchange with College Station Road, which leads to the university. They pass east-southeast of Stegeman Coliseum, begin to curve to the northeast, and cross over the North Oconee River near the Georgia Museum of Art. They pass to the southeast of the Oconee Hill Cemetery. At the next interchange, US 78 leaves the concurrency to the east-northeast, concurrent with SR 10 again, while US 78 Business meets its eastern terminus. US 78/SR 10 travel to the east-southeast and pass to the south of the Athens Ben Epps Airport. At the intersection of Cherokee Road, they pass southwest of Satterfield Park. They skirt along the northeastern edge of the Southeast Clarke Park before crossing over Shoal Creek. Just prior to crossing over Big Creek, the concurrency begins to curve to the south-southeast. They curve to the east-southeast and then to the southeast before leaving the city limits of Athens and entering Oglethorpe County. =Athens to South Carolina= US 78/SR 10 continue to the southeast, crossing over Moss Creek. After a brief east-northeast section, they travel just south of the city limits of Arnoldsville, in an east-southeast direction. Just before entering Crawford, they cross over Barrow Creek. In town, they curve to the east-northeast, travel to the north of Crawford Cemetery, and curve to the northeast. On the northeastern edge of the city limits, the concurrency begins a gradual curve to the southeast, traveling north of Brooks Lake and the Brooks Lake Dam and southwest of a branch of the Oglethrope County Library. They also pass Oglethorpe County High School. Immediately after entering Lexington, US 78/SR 10 intersect SR 22 (Comer Road), which joins the currency. The three highways travel to the south-southeast to an intersection with SR 77 (Union Point Road), which also joins the concurrency. The four-highway concurrency curves to the southeast and passes the city's magistrate court. Approximately before leaving the city limits, SR 77 departs the concurrency to the north-northeast on Elberton Road. The three highways begin a curve to the east-southeast, and SR 22 departs the concurrency to the south-southeast on Crawfordville Road. US 78/SR 10 cross over Long Creek, before curving to the south-southeast and then to the east-southeast. They cross over Buffalo Creek, curve back to the southeast, and make an easterly jaunt. Southeast of the University of Georgia Farm Lake, the highways cross over Dry Fork Creek into Wilkes County. Just after US 78/SR 10 begin a gradual curve to the southeast, they cross over Beaverdam Creek. They travel south of Rock Cemetery. Just over after intersecting the southern terminus of Centerville Road and the northern terminus of Richardson Road, they begin to travel through Rayle. In the center of town, they curve to the east. Just to the east of town, the highways curve to the east-northeast and curve back to the east-southeast and travel to the south of Washington‚ÄìWilkes Orchard Lake and the Washington‚ÄìWilkes Orchard Dam. They again curve to the east-northeast and bend to the southeast, passing the Washington‚ÄìWilkes County Airport. A little over before entering the city limits of Washington, they intersect the western terminus of US 78 Business/SR 10 Business. In the city, just west of the intersection with the northern terminus of Campbell Street, the mainline routes begin to curve to the east-southeast. They intersect SR 44 (North Mercer Street), which joins the concurrency. The three highways travel with the honorary designation of the Benjamin Wynn Fortson Jr Memorial Highway, named for Benjamin W. Fortson, Jr., a former Secretary of State of Georgia. After crossing Threemile Creek and intersecting South Elijah Clark Drive, they curve to the east-northeast. At the intersection with Carey Street, they begin to curve back to the east-southeast. They intersect SR 17 Business (known locally as Poplar Drive to the south and Tignall Road to the north). Here, SR 44 departs the concurrency to the north. After this intersection, US 78/SR 10 begin to curve to the south-southeast. They curve to the east and intersect SR 17, where the concurrency turns right, and all three highways travel to the south-southeast. The concurrent routes skirt along the eastern city limits of Washington and travel to the west of Booth Lake and the Booth Lake Dam, before very briefly re-entering Washington proper. Just before the intersection with Ann Denard Drive, they begin to skirt the city limits again. On the southeastern edge of the city, they intersect the eastern terminus of US 78 Business/SR 10 Business and the southern terminus of SR 17 Business (all three carry the Robert Toombs Avenue name), as well as the western terminus of US 378 (Lincolnton Road). Both directions also carry SR 47\\\\. US 78/SR 10/SR 17 travel to the south-southeast, known as the Sam McGill Memorial Parkway. Almost immediately, they begin to curve to the east-southeast. They intersect the southern terminus of the unsigned SR 47 Connector (Thomson Road) and the eastern terminus of Denard Road. They curve to the south-southeast and travel through rural areas of the county and skirt along the northeastern edge of the Washington‚ÄìWilkes Country Club. On the southeastern corner of the golf course, the three highways intersect the northern terminus of SR 80 (Wrightsboro Road). They curve to the east-southeast and back to the southeast. They cross over the Little River into McDuffie County. US 78/SR 10/SR 17 continue to the southeast and cross over Hart Creek and Big Creek. They curve to the south- southeast and intersect the southern terminus of SR 43 (Lincolnton Road). Approximately later, they pass Pine Grove Cemetery. Just after they intersect Stagecoach Road, they skirt along the eastern edge of Belle Meade Country Club and then the Thomson‚ÄìMcDuffie County Airport. Just before they enter Thomson, they intersect the northern terminus of SR 17 Bypass (Thomson Bypass). At this intersection, US 78/SR 10 turn left and follow the bypass around the eastern side of the city, while SR 17 continues toward the main part of the city. The three highways curve to the south-southeast and cross over, but do not have an interchange with, I-20 (Carl Sanders Highway). The trio travels through the northeastern part of Thomson and intersect SR 150 (Cobbham Road). They leave the unmarked city limits and curve to the east, before coming back to the south-southeast and intersect SR 223 (White Oak Road). The concurrency curves to the south-southwest and crosses over a CSX rail line before intersecting US 278/SR 12 (Augusta Road). At this intersection, SR 12 meets its eastern terminus, and US 78/US 278/SR 10 travel to the southeast as Augusta Highway. SR 17 Bypass travels to the south-southwest, as well. The three highways stairstep their way to the southeast, crossing over Sweetwater Creek and traveling near Boneville. Southwest of Boneville, they cross over Boneville Stream. South of Boneville, they travel southwest of Boneville Pond. Just before the intersection with Wire Road and Ellington Airline Road, they curve to the east-northeast. Just to the west of Old Augusta Road, US 78/US 278/SR 10 curve to the east-southeast. They curve to the southeast and enter Dearing. In town, they curve to the east and intersect School Drive, which leads to Augusta Technical College's Adult Education Center and Dearing Elementary School. The concurrency curves to the northeast and then back to the east- southeast, before they cross over Boggy Gut Creek and enter Columbia County. Approximately after entering the county, US 78/US 278/SR 10 enter the western city limits of Harlem. Just to the southeast of West Boundary Street, they travel about two and a half blocks south of Harlem Middle School. In the main part of town, they intersect US 221/SR 47 (Louisville Street). At the southeastern edge of the city limits, the roadway becomes known as Gordon Highway, which is a major urban corridor farther to the east. The highways travel through Campania and Berzelia. A few thousand feet later, they curve to the northeast, crossing into Richmond County (and the city limits of Augusta), and begin paralleling the northern edge of Fort Gordon. Kmart store on US 1/US 78/US 278/SR 10 (Gordon Highway) US 78/US 278/SR 10 serve as the access point for Gordon Park Speedway and Augusta State Medical Prison. A short distance later is Fort Gordon's Gate 3, a commercial vehicle gate for the Army base and Gate 2, a variable-hour gate. At the intersection for Gate 2, the highway also intersects the eastern terminus of SR 223 (East Robinson Avenue). Approximately later is an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 383 (Jimmie Dyess Parkway) and the northern terminus of an access road to Fort Gordon's Gate 1, the 24-hour main gate for the base. About halfway between here and the interchange with I-520 (Bobby Jones Expressway), the three highways leave the edge of Fort Gordon and begin to transition into an urban corridor. After the interstate, the roadway enters the main part of Augusta, passing south of Aquinas High School, and curves to the south-southeast, past the location of the now-closed Regency Mall. Immediately after a slight curve to the east is an intersection with US 1/SR 4 (Deans Bridge Road). US 1 joins the concurrency, while SR 4 continues to the northeast into downtown. The four-highway concurrency curves slightly to the east-southeast to an interchange with US 25/SR 121 (Peach Orchard Road), which both join the concurrency. The six highways travel to the east-northeast and intersect the northern terminus of Doug Barnard Parkway (the former SR 56 Spur) and the southern terminus of Molly Pond Road. The highways curve to the north- northeast and intersect Laney‚ÄìWalker Boulevard, thus effectively entering downtown. They pass just to the northwest of Magnolia Cemetery, Cedar Grove Cemetery, and May Park and southeast of James Brown Arena. A short distance later, they pass to the east of Old Medical College and the Old Government House, then they have an interchange with US 25 Business/SR 28 (Broad Street). Here, US 25 Business meets its southern terminus. Just after this interchange, the highways cross over the Savannah River into South Carolina. At the state line, SR 10/SR 121 end, while US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278, concurrent with SC 121 curve to the northeast toward North Augusta. =National Highway System= The following segments of US 78 are included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility: * From the US 278/SR 6 intersection in Lithia Springs, through the Atlanta metropolitan area, to the US 278/SR 12/SR 17 Byp. intersection just east of Thomson * The entire segment in Richmond County History=1920s= The road that would eventually be designated as US 78 was established as part of SR 8 from the Alabama state line to Decatur, SR 45 a point west of Loganville to Monroe (and possibly just to the east of it), SR 10 from Athens to Washington, SR 17 from Washington to Thomson, and SR 12 from Thomson to Augusta. By the end of 1921, SR 45 was extended from Ingleside to just west of Loganville. It was also from Monroe to a point about Bogart. Also, SR 16 was designated from the Alabama state line to Carrollton. By the end of 1926, SR 16 was redesignated as a southern branch of SR 8 from the Alabama state line to Villa Rica. US 78 was designated along the northern branch of SR 8, from the Alabama state line to Villa Rica, and mainline SR 8, from Villa Rica to Decatur. SR 45 was redesignated as SR 10 from Decatur to a point west of Loganville. SR 13 was designated from that point to Monroe, SR 8/10 were designated from Monroe to about Bogart, SR 10 was designated from either Athens or Lexington to Washington, SR 17 was designated from Washington to Thomson, and SR 12 was designated from either Thomson or Harlem to Augusta. In 1929, US 78's routing was split, with US 78N being designated on the northern branch of SR 8 (thereby replacing the mainline highway), while US 78S was designated on the southern branch of SR 8. =1930s= Before 1932, US 78/SR 8 were paved from Carrollton to just southwest of Villa Rica, and from just west of Douglasville to Decatur. US 78/SR 10 were paved from Decatur to the DeKalb‚ÄìGwinnett county line; from about Bogart to about the Clarke‚ÄìOglethorpe county line; from east of the Oglethorpe‚ÄìWilkes county line to just south-southeast of Washington. SR 13 was paved from west of Loganville to Monroe. SR 12, and possibly SR 10, was paved from Thomson to Augusta. In January, SR 13, from west of Loganville to Monroe, was redesignated SR 20\\\\. SR 10 was designated along SR 17 from Washington to Thomson. Later that year, US 78/SR 8 were paved from Willa Rica to Douglasville. By the middle of 1933, US 78N/SR 8 were paved from Bremen to Villa Rica. Also, US 78/SR 10 were paved from Lexington to south-southwest of Washington. In May, US 78N/SR 8 were paved from east of the Alabama state line to Bremen. In June, US 78N/SR 8 were paved west to the Alabama state line. By the middle of 1934, the segment of the highway from Bogart to Washington was paved. By the end of the year, SR 20 was redesignated as part of SR 10. By the middle of 1935, a very brief section of US 78/SR 10 south of Bogart was paved. Two years later, US 78/SR 10 were paved from the Gwinnett‚ÄìCobb county line to about Snellville. By the end of 1938, US 78N was redesignated as part of the mainline US 78\\\\. Also, US 78/SR 10 were paved from about Snellville to Loganville, and from Monroe to the Walton‚ÄìOconee county line. =1940s to 1980s= The 1946 map is the earliest one that showed the eastern part Atlanta on that city's inset. It showed, before 1947, US 78 routed along the current length of US 278 from Atlanta to the Belvedere Park‚ÄìAvondale Estates city line, and SR 10 from that point to just north of Stone Mountain. This is before the Stone Mountain Freeway was built farther north. By the beginning of 1967, the Stone Mountain Freeway was established, from just southwest of its interchange with SR 236, to the Cobb‚ÄìGwinnett county line. Also, US 78/SR 10 were rerouted on the north side of Monroe on a freeway bypass. In 1967, the Stone Mountain Freeway was proposed to be extended to its western terminus. By the beginning of 1970, the Stone Mountain Freeway was completed. At the beginning of the 1980s, SR 12's eastern terminus was truncated at Thomson.

The highway travels from its western terminus as US 278/SR 74 at the Alabama state line near Esom Hill to its eastern terminus at US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278/SC 121 in the Augusta metropolitan area where it crosses the Savannah River into South Carolina. The route is concurrent with SR 6 from the Alabama state line to Lithia Springs, SR 100 and SR 1 in Cedartown, SR 8 from Lithia Springs to Decatur, SR 5 from Lithia Springs to Austell, and SR 10 from Atlanta to Avondale Estates, and again from Thomson to the South Carolina state line. It is entirely concurrent with SR 12 for , and is briefly concurrent with the southern terminus of SR 124 in Lithonia. Concurrencies of US 278 with US highways in Georgia include two long ones with its parent route US 78 from Lithia Springs to Druid Hills, and again from east of Thomson to the South Carolina state line. Others include US 19/US 41 in the vicinity of Georgia Tech in Atlanta, US 29 from Georgia Tech to Druid Hills, US 23 from the eastern part of Atlanta to Druid Hills, US 129/US 441 in the vicinity of Madison, US 1 from Augusta to the South Carolina state line, and US 25 from Augusta to the South Carolina state line. It is also concurrent with I-20 from exit 75 in Lithonia until it reaches exit 90 in Covington in Newton County. US 278 largely travels parallel to I-20 from DeKalb County, near Atlanta, to McDuffie County. Route description=Alabama through Lithia Springs= The highway starts at the Alabama state line, near Esom Hill in Polk County, and is concurrent with SR 6 from its western terminus. It travels southeast as a two-lane undivided highway until the intersection with Hardin Road, where it curves northeast. Along the way, it travels straight east along the north edge of a waterway known as Esom Slough, then turns to the northeast again at the intersection with Brewster Field Road. Getting away from Esom Hill, it travels through a community known as Akes, and only has intersections with three local roads; Branch Road to the northwest, Akes Station Road to the southwest, and Lewis Drive West to the southeast, From there the highway takes another curve to the northeast, although this time more directly than earlier. At some point, it also passes a short formerly proposed eastbound right-of-way. Just before entering Cedartown, the road is joined by a concurrency with SR 100 (Canal Road). At a bridge over an abandoned Seaboard Air Line Railroad line, it travels over a connecting spur to the Silver Comet Trail, and officially enters the City of Cedartown. The spur leads to a trailhead on the northeast corner of the bridge, while the trail itself travels along the south side of the road beginning at the southeast corner of the bridge. The trail continues to run along the south side of the road as it passes an Underwriters Laboratory building, and then crosses a bridge over Dry Creek, where it loops around like the inner ramps of a cloverleaf interchange and leaves the side of the road to travel along the east bank of the creek. Condominiums are along the north side of the road and single-family houses line the south side until it reaches U.S. Route 27 Bus./SR 1 Bus. (Main Street). From there, Canal Street becomes Martin Luther King, Junior Boulevard. This segment of the highway shifts between southeast and east trajectories and, at one point, crosses an at-grade former Central of Georgia Railway line. MLK Jr Boulevard travels southeast for the last time and ends at a short concurrency with US 27/SR 1, where SR 100 turns south and US 278/SR 6 turns north. That concurrency ends at an overpass with two connecting roads on the southwest and northeast corners. The Silver Comet Trail, which travels in close proximity with US 278 from the Alabama state line flanks the highway directly along the south side for the second time east of the bridge over Fish Creek.Silver Comet Trail Map At the border with Rockmart, US 278 Bus./SR 6 Bus. branches off to the southeast, while mainline US 278/SR 6 curves to the northeast onto Nathan Dean Parkway. Before the intersection of Calloway Drive, the Silver Comet Trail makes a sharp turn south. The eastern terminus of US 278 Bus./SR 6 Bus. is also the west end of the concurrency with SR 101\\\\. US 278/SR 6/SR 101 makes a slight turn to the southeast where it encounters the intersection with SR 113, and that route joins them as they all turns south. US 278/SR 6/SR 101/SR 113 leaves the city limits at a bridge over Braswell Road and a parallel railroad line. Just after the intersection with Fairview Road, the routes curve to the southeast. The concurrency travels over a bridge above the Silver Comet Trail again, just before the intersection with Atlanta Highway and Coots Lake Road, the former of which was once a segment of US 278/SR 6/SR 101/SR 113. Not long after this, the highway passes by Coots Lake, for which the latter road is named. SR 101/SR 113 leaves the concurrency a little further southeast, and after descending into a slight valley, US 278/SR 6 crosses the Polk‚ÄìPaulding county line, where the street name is changed to Rockmart Highway. Along the way, it passes by few sites of any note other than Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport. Further east, a former segment on the opposite side called \\"Wayside Lane\\" begins, which serves the Lillian C. Poole Elementary School, and Wayside Baptist Church. Wayside Lane ends west of a power line right-of-way. After the west end of Olivet Loop (another former segment) and at a break in the median, the route officially enters Dallas. At the intersection of the east end of Olivet Loop and Vista Lake Drive, Rockmart Highway becomes the Jimmy Campbell Parkway. What passes for a major intersection after this is West Memorial Drive, another former segment of the highways. A real major intersection follows shortly, specifically Buchanan Street, where SR 120 and SR 6 Bus. meet. SR 120 joins US 278/SR 6 in a concurrency and curves further southeast away from Downtown Dallas. At a self- storage facility, the highways curve to the east again just before the intersection with Academy Drive and Vernoy‚ÄìAiken Road, and then intersects SR 61 just before curving to the southeast again. Just after curving back towards the east, it crosses a bridge over a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad line and becomes the Jimmy Lee Smith Parkway. The last intersection in Dallas is the shared intersection with Butler Industrial Drive and Cadillac Parkway. Just before the intersection with Paris Road, US 278/SR 6/SR 120 enters Hiram. As the highway passes by the Wellstar Paulding Hospital complex, the concurrency with SR 120 ends at the intersection with SR 360, where SR 120 turns north. The road continues to the east but curves to the southeast as it approaches the next major intersection, which is the east end of SR 6 Bus. Curving east-southeast it travels along a long line of commercial zoning where it intersects SR 92\\\\. After three other signalized intersections, two of which are driveways to shopping centers, the road intersects Greenfield and Metromont Roads, where Jimmy Lee Smith Parkway becomes Wendy Bagwell Parkway. After the intersection with Isley Stamper Road, US 278/SR 6 crosses the Paulding‚ÄìCobb county line and enters Powder Springs, where the name of the road is now \\"C.H. James Parkway.\\" Commercial development is reduced, but not eliminated. A former segment of the road branches off to the southeast just before the intersection with Elliot Road and Powder Springs‚ÄìDallas Road. One last intersection with Florence Road can be found before US 278/SR 6 makes a sharp curve to the south. From there, the road approaches a pedestrian bridge under the Silver Comet Trail, which is the route's final encounter with the trail, and then approaches the intersection with Richard D. Sailors Parkway, the former SR 176/SR 6 Bus. From there, it climbs a bridge over Powder Springs‚ÄìDallas Road and a parallel former Southern Railway line now owned by Norfolk Southern Railway. Curving back to the southeast after the intersection with Hill Road Southwest, the highway travels through a western portion of Austell, where it passes by a major Norfolk Southern Railway yard. Access to that yard is available at the intersection with SR 6 Spur. One last bridge over a railroad line south of Humphries Hill Road is crossed as C.H. James Parkway becomes Thornton Road. After the intersection with a dead end street named Center Street, US 278/SR 6 finally enters Lithia Springs and curves to the southeast. =Metro Atlanta area= In Lithia Springs, SR 6 continues southeast towards College Park, while US 278 turns left onto US 78/SR 5/SR 8, and returns to Austell. Within \\"downtown\\" Austell, US 78/US 278/SR 5/SR 8 becomes Veterans Memorial Highway, makes a sharp right turn and runs along the south side of a railroad line. East of a bridge over Sweetwater Creek, SR 5 splits from US 78/US 278/SR 8 at an interchange with Markham Road and heads slightly northeast through the western parts of Smyrna to just west of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. US 78/US 278/SR 8 curves southeast of the tracks, but meets up with them again as it enters Mableton, near Church Street Southwest and Old Floyd Road, only to move away from the tracks again where the routes also encounter the northern terminus of SR 139 which continues into Floyd Road Southwest. Veterans Memorial Highway curves more towards the southeast until just before passing by Lindley Middle School, where it briefly leads back towards the east, only to curve southeast again in the vicinity of Mount Harmony Memorial Gardens. Veterans Memorial Highway ends at the bridge over the Chattahoochee River and becomes Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway Northwest as it enters Atlanta. The first site within the city is the industrial complex containing the Atlanta Public Safety Annex across from the site of the abandoned Bankhead Courts housing project and park. Across from an industrial park, it encounters the northern terminus of SR 70 and then approaches the first interchange with I-285 at exit 12. Continuing southeast, it travels along the southern edge of Brookview Heights and the northern edge of Collier Heights until it reaches SR 280\\\\. East of there, it travels through northern Center Hill and then into Grove Park. The highway intersects Hollywood Drive Northwest, and makes a sharp southeast curve at the same trajectory. It starts to move more towards the east before reaching the Bankhead neighborhood then runs under the Bankhead (MARTA station) along the MARTA Green Line. After an entrance to that station, the road becomes a divided highway as it travels along the northern edge of Maddox Park, then passes under another railroad bridge containing pylons for a second track. Almost instantly the divider ends before the intersection with Marietta Boulevard Northwest, then climbs an embankment to a bridge over an abandoned railroad line. From there, the highway travels straight east and after the intersection with Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard, enters the English Avenue neighborhood where it travels over another bridge over an abandoned railroad line. Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway Northwest ends at US 19/US 41 in front of Georgia Tech, and US 78/US 278/SR 8 turns southeast along US 19/US 41 (Northside Drive Northwest) to the southeast. At the end of the US 19/US 41 concurrency, the highway is joined by US 29 and all three US highways travel along North Avenue Northeast. Tunneling under some railroad lines, including some abandoned ones, US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8 travels between Georgia Tech territory and Coca-Cola owned property. After traveling along the south side of Bobby Dodd Stadium, it encounters an interchange with I-75/I-85 (Downtown Connector), at exit 249D. Two blocks later, it passes by North Avenue (MARTA station), where North Avenue Northwest becomes North Avenue Northeast. For one block between Juniper Street and Piedmont Avenue, US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8 only travels eastbound along North Avenue Northeast. These two streets are one-way pairs along that block where the eastbound highways travel along that street, then turn north onto Piedmont Avenue and then east again onto Ponce de Leon Avenue, while the westbound highways travel from Piedmont to Juniper for one block along Ponce de Leon Avenue, then turn south onto Juniper Street and west again onto North Avenue Northeast. The southeast corner of Piedmont and Ponce de Leon includes the Savannah College of Art and Design's Ivy Hall Writing Center. US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8 continues to wind through Historic Midtown and the Old Fourth Ward, where it travels along the northern edge of an A.I.D.S. hospice,Living Room; Atlanta then the site of the former Ponce de Leon Park (now occupied by a shopping center) and Ponce City Market next to the bridge under the Atlanta Beltline Rail Trail. Traveling between the Poncey-Highland and Virginia- Highland neighborhoods, it approaches the western leg of the Freedom Parkway (a formerly proposed extension of SR 400), where the concurrency with SR 10 begins. The five highways pass the Briarcliff Plaza shopping center and intersect North Highland Avenue then travels along the southern edge of Atkins Park, where it encounters an intersection with US 23/SR 42 (Briarcliff Road Northeast / Moreland Avenue Northeast), and US 23 joins the concurrency as all four US routes and two state routes cross the DeKalb County line. South Ponce de Leon Avenue immediately splits off to the southeast, but US 23/US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8/SR 10 only travels along the main Ponce de Leon Avenue along the northern edges of Springdale Park, Virgilee Park, and Brightwood Park, while South Ponce de Leon travels along the south side of these parks. This pattern ends at Lullwater and Fairview Roads, but is repeated again shortly afterwards at Shady Side Park and Dellwood Park, where the routes enter Druid Hills. On the opposite side, a North Ponce de Leon Avenue runs along the northern edge of Deepdene Park while US 23/US 29/US 78/SR 8 branches off to the northeast traveling along the south side of that park, awaiting the reunification of North Ponce de Leon Avenue with its parent street. US 278/SR 10 branches off to the southeast onto East Lake Road Northeast, and the first notable feature is the St. Elias Antiochian Orthodox Church, across from a triangle with US 23/US 29/US 78/SR 8, which also has a Jefferson Davis Highway marker. East Lake Road Northeast travels southeast as a two-lane road with a continuous center-left turn lane that is momentarily suspended by a divider at a railroad crossing as it enters East Lake, Georgia. The road curves south and has an intersection with a connecting road to West Howard Avenue. That road is one of two that travel along the MARTA Blue Line. US 278/SR 10 travels under West Howard Avenue, then the MARTA Blue Line as well as a parallel CSX freight line and College Avenue Northeast, and then turns right at a connecting road to the aforementioned road at East Lake (MARTA station). From there, the highway turns northeast onto College Avenue and follows the freight line. Across from a local street named Cambridge Avenue, the Blue Line leaves the right-of-way for the freight line as both enter Decatur. In the meantime, US 278/SR 10 has a short concurrency with SR 155 between South Candler Street and Commerce Drive. The Blue Line returns across from the freight line along US 278/SR 10, and after traveling under a pedestrian bridge for Avondale (MARTA station), the road curves away from both lines to the east. East of the Twin Oaks shopping center, the name of US 278/SR 10 changes from East College Avenue to North Avondale Road as it enters Avondale Estates, while a local street named South Avondale Road branches off to run parallel to it. The road curves again this time to the southeast at Clarendon Avenue. =State Route 12 concurrency= SR 10 leaves US 278 as it turns northeast onto Mountain Road, and SR 12 begins, replacing it as the route's concurrent state highway. SR 12 starts on the eastern edge Avondale Estates, continuing the southeast trajectory previously used by SR 10\\\\. Along the way, it intersects a local street named Kensington Road providing access to Kensington (MARTA station). The road briefly turns straight south after SR 154, but then turns southeast again crossing I-285 for the second time at exit 43. US 278/SR 12 continues through Lithonia, where it merges with and is concurrent with SR 124 until it reaches its southern terminus at I-20 at exit 75. From there, the three highways are concurrent through Conyers and Rockdale County to Covington in Newton County. In Covington, US 278/SR 12 splits from I-20 at exit 90 and parallels the interstate on its southern side in an easterly direction to south of Social Circle, where the two highways cross I-20 at exit 101 and continue to parallel the interstate, now on its northern side. A Jefferson Davis Highway marker along US 129/278/441 in Madison The highway continues into Morgan County and travels through Rutledge and then Madison where it has a concurrency with SR 83\\\\. Shortly after this, it has a wye intersection with SR 24 Spur, which also serves as part of US 278 Truck/SR 12 Truck. Curving northwest, it joins another concurrency with US 129/US 441/SR 24\\\\. Within downtown Madison, the concurrency with SR 83 ends when that highway turns north onto West Washington Street. The concurrency with US 129/US 441/SR 24 ends across from the northern terminus of US 129 Byp./US 441 Byp./US 278 Truck/SR 12 Truck/SR 24 Byp. (Madison Bypass). Crossing a bridge over the Apalachee into Greene County,US 278, SR 12 over Apalachee River (Ugly Bridges) the highway travels through part of the Oconee National Forest before heading through Greensboro where a concurrency with SR 15 begins at North Laurel Street and another one with SR 44 begins at South Main Street. The SR 15 concurrency ends at Siloam Road, but the one with SR 44 continues along US 278/SR 12 into Union Point, where SR 44 turns north onto SR 77, and US 278/SR 12 turns southeast onto another concurrency with SR 77 within the city. Continuing southeast into Taliaferro County, the highway passes through Crawfordville where it intersects SR 22\\\\. From Crawfordville, the highway heads southeast, crosses into Warren County, and crosses I-20 at exit 154 to its southern side once again south of Sharon. US 278/SR 12 continues south into Warrenton, turns straight east at an intersection with US 278 Byp./SR 12 Byp. traveling south of the city, then serves as the eastern terminus of SR 16\\\\. The intersection with SR 80 also serves as the east end of US 278 Byp./SR 12 Byp., then the highway travels northeast into McDuffie County. The intersection with Wire Road seems unimportant other than serving as a de facto connecting route with SR 17, which it will encounter in downtown Thomson. Beyond SR 17 the highway travels east and then southeast as SR 12 ends at another concurrency (US 78/SR 10/SR 17 Byp). =East to South Carolina= Though SR 12 ends at US 78/SR 10, US 278 returns to a second concurrency with US 78/SR 10 and all three highways travel to the southeast as Augusta Highway. SR 17 Byp. travels to the south-southwest, as well. The three highways stairstep their way to the southeast, crossing over Sweetwater Creek and traveling near Boneville. Southwest of Boneville, they cross over ponds and streams named for the community. Just before the intersection with Wire Road and Ellington Airline Road, they curve to the east-northeast. Just to the west of Old Augusta Road, US 78/US 278/SR 10 curve to the east-southeast. They curve to the southeast and enter Dearing. In town, they curve to the east and intersect School Drive, which leads to Augusta Technical College's Adult Education Center and Dearing Elementary School. The concurrency curves to the northeast and then back to the east-southeast, before they cross over Boggy Gut Creek and enter Columbia County. Approximately after entering the county, US 78/US 278/SR 10 enter the western city limits of Harlem. Just to the southeast of West Boundary Street, they travel about two and a half blocks south of Harlem Middle School. In the main part of town, they intersect US 221/SR 47 (Louisville Street). At the southeastern edge of the city limits, the roadway becomes known as Gordon Highway, which is a major urban corridor farther to the east. The highways travel through Campania and Berzelia. A few thousand feet later, they curve to the northeast, crossing into Richmond County (and the city limits of Augusta), and begin paralleling the northern edge of Fort Gordon. Former Kmart store on US 1/US 78/US 278/SR 10 (Gordon Highway) US 78/US 278/SR 10 serve as the access point for Gordon Park Speedway and Augusta State Medical Prison. A short distance later is Fort Gordon's Gate 3, a commercial vehicle gate for the Army base and Gate 2, a variable-hour gate. At the intersection for Gate 2, the highway also intersects the eastern terminus of SR 223 (East Robinson Avenue). Approximately later is an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 383 (Jimmie Dyess Parkway) and the northern terminus of an access road to Fort Gordon's Gate 1, the 24-hour main gate for the base. About halfway between here and the interchange with I-520 (Bobby Jones Expressway), the three highways leave the edge of Fort Gordon and begin to transition into an urban corridor. After the interstate, the roadway enters the main part of Augusta, passing south of Aquinas High School, and curves to the south-southeast, past the location of the now-closed Regency Mall. Immediately after a slight curve to the east is an intersection with US 1/SR 4 (Deans Bridge Road). US 1 joins the concurrency, while SR 4 continues to the northeast into downtown. The four-highway concurrency curves slightly to the east-southeast to an interchange with US 25/SR 121 (Peach Orchard Road), which both join the concurrency. The six highways travel to the east-northeast and intersect the northern terminus of former SR 56 Spur (Doug Barnard Parkway) and the southern terminus of Molly Pond Road. The highways curve to the north-northeast and intersect Laney Walker Boulevard, thus effectively entering downtown. They pass just to the northwest of Magnolia Cemetery, Cedar Grove Cemetery, and May Park and southeast of James Brown Arena. A short distance later, they travel to the east of Old Medical College and the Old Government House, then they have an interchange with US 25 Bus./SR 28 (Broad Street). Here, US 25 Bus. meets its southern terminus. Just after this interchange, the highways cross over the Savannah River into South Carolina. At the state line, SR 10/SR 121 ends, while US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278, travels concurrent with SC 121\\\\. The concurrency curves to the northeast toward North Augusta, and ultimately to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. =National Highway System= The following portions of US 278 in Georgia, including portions of SR 12 from Avondale Estates to Augusta, are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From the Alabama state line to the eastern end of the SR 10 concurrency in Avondale Estates *From the eastern end of the I-20 concurrency to the intersection with SR 36/SR 142 in Covington *The brief concurrency with US 129/US 441/SR 24 in Madison *The brief concurrency with SR 15 in Greensboro *The entire Richmond County portion History=1920s= SR 12 was established at least as early as 1919 from SR 8 in Decatur to Augusta, with a south-southwestern turn to end in Waynesboro. The Covington‚ÄìMadison segment traveled through Social Circle. SR 6 was established from SR 1 in Cedartown to SR 8 in Austell. SR 8 was established from SR 6 in Austell to SR 12 in Decatur. SR 21 was designated on SR 12 in Augusta. By the end of September 1921, SR 6 was extended westward to the Alabama state line. SR 12's western terminus was shifted east-northeast to Ingleside, while its eastern terminus was truncated to end in Augusta. By October 1926, US 78 was designated on SR 8 from Austell to Avondale and on SR 12 from Thomson to Augusta. US 29 was designated on SR 8 from Atlanta to Decatur. US 1 was designated on US 78/SR 10/SR 12 in Augusta. An unnumbered road was established on a more direct path between Covington and Madison. Two segments had a \\"completed hard surface\\": from the Cobb‚ÄìFulton county line to Avondale and a portion in the west-southwest part of Augusta. By October 1929, US 19 was designated on US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 12 from Atlanta to Decatur. Three segments were completed: a portion northwest of Covington, from southeast of Social Circle to west of Greensboro, and the entire Richmond County portion (except for the western end). =1930s= By the middle of 1930, three segments were completed: the eastern part of the Polk County portion of the Cedartown‚ÄìDallas segment, the eastern part of the Cobb County portion of the Dallas‚ÄìAustell segment, and from just west of the DeKalb‚ÄìRockdale county line to Covington. Later that year, US 25 was designated on US 1/US 78/SR 10/SR 12 in Augusta. Two segments had a completed hard surface: the Austell‚ÄìAtlanta segment and a portion in the eastern part of Covington. Also, the unnumbered road (from east of Covington to southeast of Social Circle) was also completed. By the beginning of 1932, SR 12's path between Covington and Madison was shifted southward onto the previously unnumbered road. The western part remained as SR 11, while the eastern part was redesignated as SR 60\\\\. The Avondale‚ÄìConyers and Thomson‚ÄìAugusta segments were completed. In February 1932, US 19 was shifted off of SR 8 to the north; US 23 was designated on the Atlanta‚ÄìLawrenceville segment instead. In April, the western half of the Cedartown‚ÄìRockmart segment was completed. By the beginning of August, two segments were completed: from northwest of Crawfordville to just east of the Taliaferro‚ÄìWarren county line and the entire McDuffie County portion (except for the extreme western end). In August, the entire McDuffie County portion was completed. Between November 1932 and May 1933, the Warren County portion of the Warrenton‚ÄìThomson segment was completed. The next year, the Cedartown‚ÄìRockmart segment, a portion in the southeastern part of Dallas, and the Madison‚ÄìGreensboro segment, were completed. At the end of 1936, the Dallas‚ÄìAustell segment was completed. By April 1937, the Crawfordville‚ÄìWarrenton segment was completed. By July, the Greensboro‚ÄìUnion Point segment was completed. By the end of 1937, US 1/US 78/SR 4/SR 10/SR 12 were indicated to have entered the main part of Augusta on Milledgeville Road; they intersected US 25/SR 121 (Savannah Road); all seven highways traveled on Twiggs Street and 7th Street to an intersection with SR 28 (Broad Street); US 1/US 78/SR 4/SR 10/SR 12/SR 28 traveled east-southeast on Broad Street to an intersection with 5th Street; and US 1/US 78/SR 4/SR 10/SR 12 traveled on 5th Street to the South Carolina state line. The next year, the Polk County portion of the Rockmart‚ÄìDallas segment was completed. By the middle of 1939, the Union Point‚ÄìCrawfordville segment had a completed hard surface. =1940s and 1950s= In 1940, a portion west-southwest of Dallas was completed. By the beginning of 1941, two segments were completed: the western part of the Alabama‚ÄìCedartown segment and the Rockmart‚ÄìDallas segment. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, the entire segment of SR 6 from Alabama to Austell was hard surfaced. Between June 1954 and June 1955, US 278 was designated on SR 6 from the Alabama state line to Austell, US 78 from Austell to the South Carolina state line, SR 8 from Austell to just east of Atlanta, and SR 12 from east-southeast of Avondale Estates to the South Carolina state line. By June 1955, Gordon Highway was established around the southwest side of Augusta and proposed to the 5th Street/Gwinnett Street intersection. It began on US 78/SR 10/SR 12 (with US 278 newly designated on it) west-southwest of Augusta to US 25/SR 121 south of the city. No numbered highways were indicated to be designated on it, so US 1/SR 4 remained on its previous path. It had an interchange with US 25/SR 21\\\\. US 1/US 78/SR 4/SR 10/SR 12 split off of the US 78/US 278/SR 10/SR 12 concurrency just north-northeast of Gwinnett Street, where US 278 reached its eastern terminus. It traveled north-northeast to Calhoun Street, east-southeast to 5th Street, and resumed its 5th Street path, albeit on a more southern starting point. By the middle of 1957, Gordon Highway was completed around the southern and eastern sides of Augusta to 5th Street just north-northeast of Gwinnett Street in the city. US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278 was shifted onto the highway, with SR 4/SR 12 and possibly SR 10 remaining on Milledgeville Road, Twiggs Street, 7th Street, and Broad Street. =1960s and 1970s= By June 1960, SR 10 was shifted off of SR 4 and onto Gordon Highway. SR 21 was extended onto the SR 4/SR 12 concurrency on Twiggs Street and 7th Street. SR 21 reached its northern terminus at Broad Street. US 25 was shifted off of Broad Street and onto Gordon Highway, which was extended to the South Carolina state line. Its former path was redesignated as part of US 25 Bus. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, SR 21 was extended west-northwest on US 25 Bus./SR 28 (Broad Street) and followed the business route to the South Carolina state line. SR 121 was extended on Gordon Highway from the US 25/SR 21/SR 121 interchange to the state line. Also, the intersection of Gordon Highway and Broad Street was converted into an interchange. Between the beginning of 1963 and the beginning of 1969, a northern bypass of the main part of Rockmart was built from US 278/SR 6 west- northwest of the city to SR 113 in the northwestern part of the city. By the beginning of 1974, an eastern bypass of the main part of Rockmart was proposed from US 278/SR 6/SR 100 southeast of Van Wert north-northwest and north to SR 113 in the northwest part of Rockmart. Between the beginning of 1979 and the beginning of 1982, SR 6's path in Cedartown was shifted westward one block, replacing the entire length of SR 6 Loop. =1980s= In 1981, SR 21's northern terminus was truncated to Millen. SR 4's Milledgeville Road portion was truncated to the 15th Street intersection. It was routed on 15th Street, Walton Way, and then resumed its 13th Street path, just with a more southerly starting point. In 1983, a western bypass of Powder Springs, Clarkdale, and Austell, designated as SR 726, was proposed from an unnumbered road south- southwest of Powder Springs to US 78/SR 5/SR 8 southwest of Austell. In 1986, a slightly northern rerouting of US 278/SR 6 was proposed from just east of the Paulding‚ÄìCobb county line to the northern part of Powder Springs. US 278/SR 6 in the Powder Springs‚ÄìAustell area was shifted westward, onto the path of SR 726 and the northern part of the unnumbered road in Powder Springs. The former path from Powder Springs to Austell was redesignated as SR 6 Bus. Camp Creek Parkway was extended north-northwest to connect with the eastern terminus of SR 6. The next year, SR 744 Spur was proposed from US 27/SR 1/SR 100 in the southern part of Cedartown to the proposed path of SR 744 southeast of it. Part of the eastern bypass of Rockmart, designated as SR 748, was proposed from SR 113 east-northeast of the city south and south-southeast to US 278/SR 6 east-southeast of Van Wert. A northeastern bypass of Yorkville, designated as SR 789, was proposed from north-northeast of Yorkville to east of it. A southern bypass of Dallas, designated as SR 768, was proposed from west-southwest of Dallas to US 278/SR 6/SR 120 southeast of it; this replaced the proposed path of SR 6 Byp. In 1988, a proposed northern rerouting of US 278/SR 6 was designated as a second iteration of SR 726. =1990s= In 1990, US 278/SR 6 was shifted northeast from Van Wert on SR 113 and southeast on the proposed path of SR 748, with SR 101/SR 113 concurrent with them to Yorkville. US 278/SR 6/SR 120 was routed on the proposed path of SR 768\\\\. At this time, SR 726 was completed. The next year, the path of US 278/SR 6 in Cedartown was shifted southward from the central part of the city to the southern part, onto the proposed path of SR 744 Spur. US 278/SR 6, as well as part of US 27/SR 1, was routed onto parts of the former path of SR 744\\\\. US 278/SR 6 in Rockmart was shifted northward onto a more direct path just north of the city. US 278/SR 6 in the Powder Springs area was shifted northward, onto the former path of SR 726. Major intersectionsSpecial routes Three special routes of US 278 exist in the state of Georgia. A business route in Rockmart, a truck route in Madison, and a truck bypass in Warrenton.

In the U.S. state of Georgia, US 25 is as a highway that travels south to north in the eastern part of the state, near the Atlantic Ocean, serving Brunswick, Statesboro, and Augusta on its path from Brunswick to South Carolina at the Savannah River. Its routing travels through portions of Glynn, Wayne, Long, Tattnall, Evans, Bulloch, Jenkins, Burke, and Richmond counties. The segment of US 25/SR 121 from Interstate 16 (I-16) south-southwest of Statesboro north to Millen is the western segment of the Savannah River Parkway, a four-lane divided highway that roughly parallels the Savannah River. The segment from Millen north to I-520 in Augusta is the combined segment of the parkway. This highway is being considered for inclusion as part of I-3, which is ultimately planned to stretch from Savannah to Knoxville, Tennessee. Route description=Glynn County= US 25 begins at an intersection with US 17/SR 25 (Glynn Avenue) in the southern part of Brunswick in Glynn County. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of SR 25 Connector. This intersection is west of the Marshes of Glynn Overlook Park and is north of Howard Coffin Park. US 25 and SR 25 Connector travel concurrently on Gloucester Street to the west-southwest. At the intersection with US 341/SR 27 (Oglethorpe Street), SR 25 Connector ends, and US 25 begins a nearly concurrency with US 341/SR 27\\\\. The three highways travel to the north-northwest. Just after F Street, they curve to the north-northeast and skirt along the western edge of Gateway Park. On the northern edge of the park, they intersect Newcastle Street and turn left, back to the north- northwest. Between L and M Streets, the concurrency passes just to the southwest of Orange Park, and between Q and R Streets, they pass to the southwest of Palmetto Park. Between the intersection with Oak Street/1st Street, US 25/US 341/SR 27 pass Greenwood Cemetery. Between 2nd and 5th Streets, they pass Selden Park. Between 4th and 7th Streets, they pass Palmetto Cemetery. At 7th Street, they enter Dock Junction. Just before 9th Street, the concurrency passes Acco Park. Farther to the north-northwest, they intersect SR 303 (Blythe Island Highway/Community Road). The roadway passes to the southwest of Ballard Park and cross over the Brunswick‚ÄìAltamaha Canal. Immediately, US 25/US 341/SR 27 begin to curve to the northwest. Approximately later, they cross over Yellow Bluff Creek. Only about later, they have an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95; Purple Heart Trail). At Crispen Boulevard, the concurrency leaves the city limits of Dock Junction. They cross over Burnett Creek and travel through Pyles Marsh, before curving back to the north-northwest. Immediately after that curve, the three highways travel through Brobston. Just before entering Sterling, they pass east of Sterling Park. In town, they intersect SR 99, as well as the eastern terminus of SR 32\\\\. The highways travel through Pennick and Zuta, before passing to the southeast of Berry Lake. After traveling through Everett, they enter Wayne County. =Wayne County= When the concurrent routes pass Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, they curve back to the northwest, travel through Mt. Pleasant and cross over Alex Creek. After traveling through Grangerville, Pendarvis, and Gardi, they make a slight westward jog in Odessa; then, they cross over Ponholloway Creek, before entering Jesup. In town, US 25 splits off from US 341/SR 27 (East Cherry Street) to the north-northwest and intersects US 301/SR 23, with which US 25 begins traveling concurrently. The three highways travel to the north-northeast in the northeast part of the city. They curve to the north-northwest, before curving to the north and meeting US 84/SR 38, which join the concurrency. Immediately afterward, the five highways travel to the north-northeast and leave the city limits. The concurrency travels through rural parts of the county, before traveling through Doctortown, and curving to the northeast and crossing over the Altamaha River into Long County on the Dr. J. Alvin Leaphart Sr. Memorial Bridge. =Long County= US 25/US 84/US 301/SR 23/SR 38 continue to the northeast and travel through rural areas of the county, crossing over Forrest Pond, Back Swamp (in two places), Corker Branch, Fountain Branch, Brickyard Branch, and Jones Creek on its way to Ludowici. In town, the concurrency intersects SR 57 south, which travels to the southeast. At this intersection, US 25/US 301/SR 23, as well as SR 57 north travel to the northwest, while US 84/SR 38 continue to the northeast. After a slight jog to the east, the roadway crosses through Wefanie. Just before leaving the county, they intersect the southwest terminus of former SR 261, today known as Marcus Nobles Road. Right after that, they curve to the north-northwest and cross over Beards Creek into Tattnall County. =Tattnall County= US 25/US 301/SR 23/SR 57 travel to the east of Kicklighters Pond. After an intersection with the western terminus of SR 196, the roadway curves to the north-northeast and enters Glennville. At an intersection with SR 144 (Barnard Street), SR 23/SR 57 depart the concurrency to the northwest. At this intersection, US 25/US 301 continue to the north-northeast, concurrent with SR 73, which begins here. Just after leaving the city limits, the highways pass the Georgia Veterans Memorial Cemetery ‚Äì Glennville, Stricklands Pond, and Strickland Pond Dam. Alongside Smith State Prison, the concurrency begins to curve to the north. They curve back to the north-northeast and cross over Beards Creek just before intersecting the southern terminus of what used to be SR 250\\\\. After passing to the east of Durrence Pond, just west of Midway, US 25/US 301/SR 73 cross into Evans County. =Evans County= The concurrency passes to the east of Union Cemetery and then to the west of Evans Heights Golf Club. Approximately later, it crosses over Bull Creek. After a westward jog past Richards Pond, the highways curve to a due north routing and enter Claxton. In downtown, they intersect US 280/SR 30 (Main Street). Just before leaving town, the highways curve to the northeast. Just northeast of the city limits, US 25/US 301/SR 73 pass southeast of the Claxton Sewage Treatment Pond and the Claxton Sewage Treatment Pond Dam. About later, they cross over the Canoochee River on the Claxton Bridge. They provide access to the Claxton‚ÄìEvans County Airport and then curve to the north-northwest. After curving back to the north-northeast, the highways curve to a due north routing and intersect the northern terminus of SR 169\\\\. About later, they cross into Bulloch County. =Bulloch County= Almost immediately, the three highways curve to the north-northwest, passing Ephesus Cemetery, and curve back to the north-northeast and pass by Nevils Pond and Nevils Pond Dam. They again curve to the north-northwest and have an interchange with I-16 (Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway). US 25/US 301/SR 73 curve to a nearly due north routing briefly before curving to the northeast and intersect SR 46, southeast of Register, just before crossing over Lotts Creek. The highways pass Riggs Lake and Riggs Lake Dam. Later on, they travel through Jimps, just before passing a campus of Ogeechee Technical College. They intersect the southern terminus of US 25 Byp./SR 67 Byp. and US 301 Byp./SR 73 Byp. (Veterans Memorial Parkway) and enter Statesboro. They pass just to the west of Georgia Southern University and skirt along the eastern edge of W. Jones Lane Memorial Park. They curve to the north-northeast and cross over Little Lotts Creek before intersecting SR 67 (Fair Road). In downtown, they curve to the north-northwest and intersect US 80/SR 26 (Northside Drive East). At this intersection, US 301/SR 73 continue to the north-northwest, while US 25/SR 67 travel to the west-southwest, concurrent with US 80/SR 26\\\\. The four highway curve to the north-northwest before assuming a more northwesterly routing. After leaving the city limits, they intersect the northern terminus of US 25 Byp./SR 67 Byp. They provide access to William James Middle School. In Hopeulikit, the four highways curve to the north-northwest; then, US 80/SR 26 split off to the southwest. About later, US 25/SR 67 enter Jenkins County. =Jenkins County= After continuing to the north-northwest, US 25/SR 67 pass just to the northeast of Paynes Chapel Cemetery and Clifton Cemetery, before they curve to the north-northeast. Then, they intersect SR 121, which joins the concurrency. Approximately later, immediately after traveling through Emmalane, they intersect SR 23, which also joins the concurrency. At Union Camp Logging Road, the four highways curve to the northeast and cross over the Ogeechee River. Just after entering Millen, they begin to curve to the north-northeast and intersect SR 17 Byp. (South Gray Street), which joins the concurrency. At an intersection with SR 17 (Winthrope Avenue), SR 17 Byp. ends, and SR 23/SR 67 depart the concurrency to the east. Less than before leaving town, US 25/SR 121 curve to the north- northwest. On the northern edge of the city limits, they intersect the northern terminus of SR 21\\\\. The two highways pass the Magnolia Springs Country Club and travel through the southwestern part of Magnolia Springs State Park, in the community of Lawton. On the northwestern edge of the park, they pass Millen Airport and curve back to the north-northeast, passing Magnolia View Lake and travel to the west of Perkins; then they curve once again to the north-northwest and enter Burke County. =Burke County= The concurrency travels just to the west of Munnerlyn, passing Jenkins Lake, and make a slight westward jog, and curve to a due north routing before curving back to the north-northwest in Idlewood and passing Burke County Airport. They intersect the southern terminus of US 25 Byp./SR 121 Byp. (Burke Veterans Parkway). The mainline highways turn to the right and curve back to the north- northwest and have an interchange with the bypass route. Just before entering Waynesboro the roadway passes to the west of the Burke County campus of Augusta Technical College. In town, they curve to the north-northeast and intersect SR 24, which joins the concurrency. The three highways travel to the northwest and pass Burke Medical Center and the Burke County Museum. They intersect SR 56/SR 80 (6th Street). At this intersection, SR 24 departs the concurrency to the southwest. Just past 9th Street, they pass Burkeland Garden. About past the West 13th Street/Peachtree Street intersection, the concurrency begins to curve to the north-northeast to an intersection with the northern terminus of US 25 Byp./SR 121 Byp. The mainline highways turn left and begin curving to the north-northwest and leave town; then, they curve to a nearly due north routing. They cross over Walnut Branch and Brier Creek, before traveling to the west of Stockton Pond. Approximately later, the highways cross over McBean Creek into Richmond County and the city limits of Augusta. =Richmond County= Former Kmart store on Gordon Highway in Augusta Just before passing the Pointe South Golf Club, US 25/SR 121 begin to travel along the Hephzibah‚ÄìAugusta city line. They intersect the eastern terminus of SR 88\\\\. After curving to the north-northeast, they re-enter Augusta proper. They pass the Richmond Factory Pond and Richmond Factory Pond Dam and curve to the northeast. Then they pass by the East Central Regional Hospital‚ÄìGracewood. The two highways curve to the north and cross over Butler Creek and make a gradual winding path to an interchange with I-520 (Bobby Jones Expressway), passing to the west of Foss Park and the Charles B. Webster Detention Center and to the east of Rollins Elementary School and Sego Middle School along the way. US 25/SR 121 intersect Windsor Spring Road, which is also part of the I-520 interchange. The roadway curves to the north-northeast. At the intersection with Lumpkin Road, they pass Alleluia Community School and are just to the west of Elliot Park. The concurrency crosses over Rocky Creek just southeast of Lombard Pond. It curves to the northeast and intersects the southern terminus of Tubman Home Road and the northern terminus of SR 56 (Mike Padgett Highway). Approximately later, they have an interchange with US 1/US 78/US 278/SR 10 (Gordon Highway) and begin to travel concurrently with those four highways. The six-highway concurrency continue to the northeast, to an intersection with the southern terminus of Molly Pond Road and the northern terminus of Doug Barnard Parkway (former SR 56 Spur). Just before that intersection, the roadway begins to curve to the north-northeast. The highways pass just to the northwest of Magnolia Cemetery, Cedar Grove Cemetery, and May Park and southeast of James Brown Arena. A short distance later, they pass to the east of Old Medical College and the Old Government House, then an interchange with US 25 Bus./SR 28 (Broad Street). Here, US 25 Bus. meets its southern terminus. Just after this interchange, the highway crosses over the Savannah River into South Carolina. At the state line, SR 10/SR 121 end, while US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278, concurrent with SC 121 curve to the northeast toward North Augusta. =National Highway System= From its southern terminus, in Brunswick, to Ludowici and from I-16, south-southwest of Statesboro to its northern terminus, at the South Carolina state line on the northeastern edge of Augusta are included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History=1920s= The road that would later be designated as part of US 25 was established in 1920 as an unidentified road from Brunswick to about Sterling, SR 27 from that point to Jesup, SR 38 from Jesup to Ludowici, SR 23 from Statesboro to Millen, and SR 21 from Millen to Augusta. By the end of the next year, SR 23 was designated between Ludowici and Glennville, SR 26 was designated on a routing southwest of, and into, Statesboro, SR 46 was designated between Statesboro and Hopeulikit, and SR 67 was designated from Hopeulikit to a point southwest of Millen. The latter two supplanting SR 23, which was re-routed on a more westerly path. By the end of 1926, US 341 was designated along SR 27 between Brunswick and Jesup. By the end of 1929, US 80 had been designated along SR 46 between Statesboro and Hopeulikit. =1930s= By 1932, US 341/SR 27 were paved in Glynn County. Also, SR 73 was designated from Clayton to an intersection with SR 26 southwest of Statesboro, approximately where I-16 is today. Farther to the north-northwest, US 25 was designated from Hopeulikit to Augusta, and US 25/SR 21 were paved from Waynesboro to Augusta. That January, the positions of SR 26 and SR 46 were swapped. In April, SR 23's Ludowici‚ÄìDarien segment was redesignated as part of SR 99; SR 23 was re-reouted along SR 38 between Jesup and Ludowici. By May 1933, that Jesup‚ÄìLudowici segment of SR 23/SR 38 was paved. In May, US 25/SR 21 were paved from Millen to just north of the Jenkins‚ÄìBurke county line. In July, SR 23 was paved from the Long‚ÄìTattnall county line to Glennville. In late 1934, SR 73 was extended southward from Claxton to Glennville. A vert short stretch of SR 46 south of Statesboro was paved. US 25/SR 67 was paved from just southeast of the SR 23 intersection south-southwest of Millen and into that town. Between June and October 1935, US 25/SR 21 was paved between the Jenkins‚ÄìBurke county line and Waynesboro. At the end of that year, nearly half of US 341/SR 27, between the Glynn‚ÄìWayne county line and Jesup, was paved. In mid-to-late 1936, SR 46 was paved from the SR 73 intersection southwest of Statesboro into the city. About one year later, all of US 341/SR 27 between Brunswick and Jesup were paved. Also, a short stretch of SR 23 northwest of Ludowici was paved. In August 1938, all of SR 23 between Ludowici and Glennville was paved. By mid-1939, US 25 was designated along US 341/SR 27 between Sterling (and perhaps Brunswick) and Jesup. It was also designated along SR 23 between Ludowici and Glennville and along SR 73 between Claxton and the intersection with SR 46, southwest of Statesboro. It is unclear whether it was designated along the stretches of roadway in between those. =1940s= Between April and July 1941, US 25/SR 73, between the Evans‚ÄìBulloch county line and the intersection with SR 46, were paved. In 1942, SR 73 was paved from Glennville to the Tattnall‚ÄìEvans county line. In 1943, SR 73 was paved all the way from Glennville to Claxton. By the end of 1946, US 25 was designated along SR 23/SR 38 between Jesup and Ludowici. In Augusta, US 25 (and presumably SR 21) approached downtown on Savannah Road. It intersected US 1/US 78 (Milledgeville Road). The three highways traveled to the northeast on Twiggs Street until just past Gwinnett Street, where they curved to the north-northeast onto 7th Street. At the intersection with SR 28 (Broad Street), US 1/US 78 turned right, while US 25 turned left. At 13th Street, US 25 turned to the right and crossed into South Carolina. Also, all stretches of road from Brunswick to Augusta were paved. By the middle of 1948, US 301 was designated along US 25/SR 23 from Ludowici to Glennville. =1950s= By the end of 1953, US 301 was designated along SR 73 between Glennville and Claxton. In 1955, US 278 was added to the intersection of US 1/US 78 and US 25 in Augusta. Also, US 1/US 78 left the concurrency with US 25 just past Gwinnett Street and turned right onto Calhoun Street, then left onto 8th Street. In 1956, the four U.S. highways in Augusta were re- routed on a bypass to the east of the main part of downtown. The former route of US 78 became part of SR 12, and the former route of US 1 became part of SR 4\\\\. SR 4 also took the former route of US 25 through the city, but ended at SR 28\\\\. US 25 followed the bypass onto 8th Street with US 1/US 78/US 278\\\\. At the intersection with SR 28, it turned left as it had done previously, just a little farther to the east-southeast. It appears that US 278 ended at this intersection. SR 21 followed Savannah Road and ended at the intersection with SR 4. =1960s= By the middle of 1960, US 25 was no longer routed on Broad and 13th Streets. It was re-routed to continue following US 1/US 78 and SR 10, which had only recently joined the concurrency. In its place was the newly commissioned US 25 Business. Between 1960 and 1963, SR 121 was designated, concurrent with US 25, as it does today. At least as far back as 1965, US 25/US 341/SR 27 traveled through Brunswick on Norwich Street, before being moved slightly to the west. During this time period, the eastern bypass in Augusta was named Gordon Highway. SR 121's concurrent section was designated along US 25, as it exists today. The Gordon Highway‚ÄìBroad Street intersection was reconfigured into an interchange. =1980s= In the early part of the decade, SR 21's concurrency with US 25 was truncated at Millen. Between 1983 and 1986, US 25/US 341/SR 27 were moved to the west in Brunswick to follow Newcastle Street.

The design team included David Thurston, who later developed several other light seaplanes including the Colonial Skimmer, Lake Buccaneer, Thurston Teal and Seafire. Only 19 aircraft were built, and these were used only for testing and as demonstrators. Design and development The Goodyear Aircraft Corporation began to design a small light amphibian before the end of the Second World War. The prototype designated GA-1 first flew in September 1944. It was a cantilever high-wing monoplane with underwing stabilizing floats. The GA-1 had an all-metal fabric-covered wing, an all-metal single-step hull, and a cruciform tail unit. It had a retractable tail-wheel, accommodation for two, and a pylon-mounted piston engine with a pusher propeller. Operational history After successful testing of the prototype, 18 demonstration aircraft were built. These differed from the prototype in that they had room for the pilot and two passengers. Two versions were built, the GA-2 with a Franklin 6A4-145-A3 piston engine, and the GA-2B with a Franklin 6A4-165-B3 flat-six piston engine. Although the aircraft were successfully tested and demonstrated, the costs involved in producing the aircraft prevented it being sold at a price that private pilots could afford, and the project was abandoned. In 1950, a revised four-seat variant the GA-22 Drake was flown, followed in 1953 by the GA-22A Drake; only one of each was built. Variants ;GA-1 Duck :Prototype two-seater originally powered by a Franklin 4ACG-100-H3 piston engine, later fitted with a 125 hp (93 kW) Franklin 6A engine, one built. ;GA-2 Duck :Demonstration three-seat aircraft with a Franklin 6A4-145-A3 engine, 16 built, some later modified as GA-2Bs. ;GA-2B Duck :Demonstration three-seat aircraft with a Franklin 6A4-165-B3 engine, six modified from GA-2s in 1949. ;GA-22 Drake :Revised larger variant with four- seats, two built (one as a GA-22A with a revised hull) with the first flight in 1950. ;GA-22A Drake :Revised larger variant with four-seats, powered by a Continental E225-8 and converted into a flying boat with a revised hull; first flight in 1953.

During World War II, Schumacher served in the German Luftwaffe, commanding the Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) fighter wing. After World War II, Schumacher was an active politician and elected member of the Landtag in Lower Saxony (1951‚Äì1963). Military career Schumacher initially fought in World War I as an artillerist before he transferred to the Kaiserliche Marine and participated in the Battle of Jutland as a F√§hnrich on a battlecruiser.Luftwaffe 39‚Äì45 Historia website. He learned to fly in 1930 and transferred to the newly emerging Luftwaffe in 1934, involved in the flight- and leader-training departments.Luftwaffe Officer Career Summaries website. On 1 August 1936 he was given a squadron command in I./JG 136, he was subsequently promoted to major, and full command of the I./JG 136 -- Gruppe (subsequently renamed II./JG 333 on 1 November 1938, and again on 1 May 1939 to II./Jagdgeschwader 77) based on the northern coast, the German Bight. Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Schumacher was appointed Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer Deutsche Bucht (Jaf√º Deutsche Bucht‚ÄîFighter-commander German Bight) in October, to control all the disparate fighter units stationed on the northern coast. In November he was then given orders to set up a brand new Geschwader. Initially (and unusually) comprising just a Stab or HQ Flight, called Stab./JG Nord, it was soon officially authorised as JG 1 on 30 November 1939, with Schumacher as its first wing commander.Weal 2006, pg.8 It inherited command of I./JG 1 which had been previously operating without an HQ, and was also based at Jever on the northwest coast. He claimed his first aerial victory over a Vickers Wellington bomber, among the 12 shot down in the aerial battles of the Heligoland Bight on 18 December 1939.Weal 2006, pp. 8‚Äì9 His successful co-ordination of a range of different units and aircraft was effective and forced a fundamental change in air strategy for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the first year of the war, as they abandoned unescorted bomber missions. He claimed his only other victory, a Bristol Blenheim, over the North Sea on 27 December 1939. He led his Geschwader in the Battle of the Netherlands, although his unit did not follow the armies in the invasion of France or the Battle of Britain, instead being kept back on the coast. For his outstanding leadership and success he was the very first fighter pilot awarded the Knight's Cross - on 21 July 1940. Because of that, and/or his lack of direct involvement in the Battle of Britain, he kept his role as a Geschwaderkommodore and was not dismissed by Hermann G√∂ring in his purge of the senior fighter commanders a month later. On 8 November 1941, he controversially shot down a de Havilland Dragon of the Finnish Air Force by mistake, and was relieved of command.Luftwaffe Officer Career Summaries website. However, he was soon re-appointed to a new post - as Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer Norwegen on 5 January 1942. Again this was a role to co- ordinate a number of scattered units, this time across Norway, facing both the Russian Polar Front, the North Sea and Arctic Ocean. This subsequently also got further centralised with the formation of the new Jagdgeschwader 5 in May 1942. In late February 1943 he was sent to Romania, and in May became head of the Luftwaffe mission to oversee the training of the Romanian air-force. Finally, in the latter years of the war, now a Generalmajor, he was tasked with assignments co-ordinating the Defence of the Reich. He finished the war having flown 160 missions, with just the two victories from 1939.

In his past roles, Ireland was the Miami Dolphins' general manager from 2008 to January 2014; a Dallas Cowboys executive prior to that; and, a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs before that. Before his career as a football executive, Ireland was an assistant football coach at the University of North Texas, and a player at Baylor University. Ireland was also a childhood ball boy for the Chicago Bears. High school and college career Ireland was a wide receiver and placekicker and soccer forward for Cooper High School in the 1980s, and then a placekicker for the Baylor Bears from 1988 to 1991. He became the starter at placekicker as a sophomore. At Baylor, Ireland was known for making difficult kicks but missing the easy ones. Against Rice University in 1991, for example, he made a 58-yard field goal, then missed field goals of 43, 45, and 27 yards. Baylor, a 20.5 point favorite, lost the game by three points. Baylor was ranked 8th in the Associated Press poll at that time. Ireland finished his college career third on the school's all-time scoring list with 213 points. His 45 career field goals, including a 58-yard effort against Rice in 1991, were school records. He is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Professional career=Early years= Ireland began his professional career as the special teams coach at the University of North Texas from 1992 to 1993. He became a scout for the NFL Scouting Combine from 1994 to 1996. He later was hired to be an area scout for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1997 to 2000. =Dallas Cowboys= Ireland was a national talent-scout for the Dallas Cowboys from 2001 to 2005. During this period, the team drafted four future-Pro Bowl selections: safety Roy Williams; offensive lineman Andre Gurode; cornerback Terence Newman; and tight end Jason Witten. In 2005, Ireland was promoted to Vice President of College and Pro Scouting. In what would be Ireland's final season with the Cowboys (in 2007), the Cowboys went 13-3 and won the NFC East Division Championship. At the time of his departure in January 2008, 38 of the team's 53 players were acquired over the past three years, including 12 of 22 starters. =Miami Dolphins= On January 2, 2008, Ireland was officially hired by then-Executive Vice President of Football Operations Bill Parcells as general manager of the Miami Dolphins. Ireland and Parcells had worked together previously, when Parcells was the head coach and football operations boss at the Dallas Cowboys (2003-2006). On December 28, 2008, the Miami Dolphins defeated the New York Jets 24-17, securing the AFC East title and becoming the first team in NFL history to reach the playoffs after having won only one game during the previous season. In reaction to the victory and title, Ireland granted a rare interview to ESPN's Tim Graham, saying, \\"It's a remarkable feeling. I'm so proud of these coaches, these players. Coach always asked us and the players right there in training camp, 'Why not us?' Well, Why not us? I'm just so proud of the coaches and what they've done.\\" In April 2010, Ireland asked NFL prospect Dez Bryant during a formal interview whether Bryant's mother was a prostitute. According to two unnamed NFL sources, Bryant allegedly told Ireland that his dad was a pimp and that his mother worked for his father. Bryant denies ever telling Ireland that his father was a pimp. Ireland later apologized to Bryant for asking the question. On September 7, 2010, Ireland assumed full command of operations on a day-to-day basis. Bill Parcells became a daily consultant for the Miami Dolphins, a position he has since left. Ireland's tenure with the Dolphins became controversial as the club's on-field successes declined after 2008. Public efforts to recruit free agent players such as Peyton Manning, and Alex Smith were unsuccessful, as was the effort to recruit former Titans coach Jeff Fisher. Ireland's handling of his Dez Bryant interview was cited as an example of poor leadership on Ireland's part and a perception that Ireland was not honest in dealings with players. In 2011, some fans pitched in to have a plane fly over Sun Life Stadium reading: \\"MR ROSS: SAVE OUR DOLPHINS. FIRE IRELAND.\\" At a home game in 2012, Ireland was seen speaking to and taking pictures with fans. One fan told him to \\"fire yourself\\" stating that Ireland has made the Miami Dolphins the laughing stock of the NFL since he's been GM. Ireland responded to that fan by calling him an \\"Asshole\\". In 2013, Ireland came under further scrutiny when the off-field interactions between offensive guard Richie Incognito and offensive tackle Jonathan Martin were brought to light by the latter. He reacted to allegations of a culture of bullying on the part of Incognito by suggesting that Martin \\"punch\\" him. A second airplane banner was flown over Sun Life Stadium on November 17, during warmups for the Dolphins' Week 11 game against the San Diego Chargers, reading \\"MR ROSS: WE TOLD YOU SO 2 YEARS AGO #FIREIRELAND\\". On January 7, 2014, the Dolphins announced that they had mutually parted ways with Ireland. =Seattle Seahawks= On April 26, 2014, the Seattle Seahawks announced they had hired Jeff Ireland to work as a consultant for the 2014 NFL Draft, the Seahawks also announced that a possible long term deal would be negotiated after the draft. Ireland's tenure with the Seattle Seahawks, however, was short-lived as the team decided to move on without him after only one month. =New Orleans Saints= On January 20, 2015, Adam Schefter tweeted \\"It's not just Dennis Allen joining the Saints. Former Dolphins GM Jeff Ireland is being hired to do college scouting for the Saints, per source.\\". He was hired to be the Saints' assistant general manager & college scouting director. Personal life Ireland is the stepson of College Football Hall of Famer E. J. Holub, who played center and linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Texans. Ireland is also the grandson of Jim Parmer, who played for the Philadelphia Eagles and was a personnel executive for the Chicago Bears. Jeff and his wife, Rachel, have four children.

In the U.S. state of South Carolina, it begins as a highway that travels south to north in the western part of the state, serving the northern part of the Augusta metropolitan area, Greenwood, and Greenville on its path from North Augusta to North Carolina in the Saluda Mountains, near Travelers Rest. Route description=ADHS corridor W= US 25, from I-85 to the North Carolina state line, is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), which is part of Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). Of the section of US 25, only was authorized for ADHS funding. In the 2013 fiscal year, South Carolina completed Corridor W and also became the first state to complete its entire ADHS miles among all 13 Appalachian states. The entire section of US 25 along Corridor W boasts a four-to-six-lane limited- access road, with interchanges at major intersections. History Established in 1927 as an original US highway, it was assigned to the entirety of SC 21, which was removed the following year. Traveling closely as it does today, it went from North Augusta to Travelers Rest, connecting the cities and towns of Edgefield, Greenwood, Ware Shoals, and Greenville. In 1937, US 25 was rerouted in Greenville, moving onto College Avenue from Main Street to Buncombe Street. By 1961, US 25 was moved onto a new bypass east of North Augusta, leaving US 25 Bus.

Biography From left to right: Su Bong, Seung Sahn, and Dae Gak Robert Genthner (Buddhist name Dae Gak, \\"great enlightenment\\") was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1947. He went to graduate school in Psychology at Kent State University. Genthner graduated from Kent State in 1973 with his Ph.D. in clinical psychology, later that year teaching psychology at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Kentucky. He stopped teaching in 1979, afterward practicing as a licensed psychologist. In 1979, Genthner met Korean monk and Zen teacher Seung Sahn during a retreat at the Providence Zen Center. In the early 1980s, he and several other individuals founded the Lexington Zen Center in his home, with retreats sometimes taking place at the homes of other practitioners. The group became affiliated with Seung Sahn's Kwan Um School of Zen, founded in July 1983. In 1986, he co- founded a Zen temple at Furnace Mountain with Seung Sahn. The temple, Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah (which means \\"Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple\\"), was completed in 1994. Also that year, Genthner/Dae Gak received Dharma transmission from Seung Sahn, and founded the Cincinnati Zen Center. In 2000, Genthner was subject to disciplinary action following allegations by two patients of sexual misconduct and violations of patient confidentiality; while denying wrongdoing, he agreed to a suspension of one year, a fine, and one year of supervised probation after his license was reinstated.Lexington Herald Leader, 7/25/2000, Psychologist's License Suspended, B3Fall 2000 Psychology Board News, State of Kentucky Board of Psychological Examiners, Volume 3, Issue 2, \\"Robert W.

Route description After crossing the Savannah River from Georgia, US 278 bypasses downtown North Augusta, South Carolina to the south en route to Beech Island and Johnson Crossroads. It then forms a de facto northern boundary of the Savannah River Site, crossing into the property on a few occasions. The route then continues eastward and then southward through the communities of Barnwell, Kline, Allendale, Fairfax, Hampton, Varnville, Ridgeland, and Hardeeville where it meets I-95. US 278 shares the route between Ridgeland and Hardeeville with US 17\\\\. Upon reaching Hardeeville, the route heads eastward toward the Atlantic with large residential and commercial developments lining the spine of the road from Hardeeville through Okatie and Bluffton. The route crosses over Calibogue Sound onto Hilton Head Island. After a five-mile stretch in which the route is tolled, US 278 ends at US 278 Business on the southern portion of Hilton Head Island, just outside Sea Pines Plantation. =Cross Island Parkway= On Hilton Head Island, US 278 was previously routed along what is now US 278 Business until a new toll road, named the Cross Island Parkway, opened on January 16, 1998. The section of roadway cost $83 million to build and was funded with a combination of state funds, federal funds, state highway bonds and tolls. The controlled access toll road has only one interchange along its route at Marshland Drive. It was the first toll road built in South Carolina in modern history. A majority of the road users pay their tolls using Palmetto Pass, South Carolina's system for electronic toll collection. Tolls will be removed once the bonds sold to build the road are retired. The completion of the Cross Island Parkway (a direct expressway connection from the north side to the south side of the island) has caused a great amount of commercial and residential development along the road. Before the toll road opened, it could take one hour to travel the route of what was then signed as US 278 (William Hilton Parkway) during peak tourism season. The Cross Island Parkway greatly relieved congestion on that road when it opened. =Tolls= Cross Island Parkway Toll Plaza Toll rates, for 2-axle vehicles, along Cross Island Parkway are $1.25 at the toll plaza and $1.00 at the Marshland Road/Spanish Wells Road interchange. Each additional axle is $1.00 (plaza and ramps). The toll plaza has both electronic toll collection (ETC) and cash lanes, which are manned 24 hours a day; Marshland Road/Spanish Wells Road interchange accept only ETC or exact change only. Those that do not have exact change or do not pay the toll have five days to contact the Cross Island Parkway Customer Service Center to make a payment; after that time, a violation notice will be mailed. Travelers that make a mistake of taking the toll road may request a \\"Turn Around Pass\\", which gives them ten minutes to continue along the highway, turn around at the roundabout and return the pass at the toll plaza on the return trip. Only the Palmetto Pass is accepted on the Cross Island Parkway. History US 278 was established, in South Carolina, in 1965, traveling from Augusta, Georgia to Hilton Head Island. Crossing the Savannah River, in concurrency with US 1/US 25/US 78/SC 121, it then overlapped with SC 125 on Atomic Road, to Beech Island. Replacing SC 28 from Beech Island to Almeda, where it then replaced SC 128, going through Ridgeland, to Old House. Replacing part of SC 462, it went south into Bluffton and then east into Hilton Head Island, replacing part of SC 46. Throughout the 1980s, US 278 was widen to four-lane, in phases, east of SC 170, in Bluffton. In 1996-1997, US 278 was rerouted south of Ridgeland to Hardeeville, then east on new primary routing to SC 170, in Bluffton. Its former routing was replaced by SC 336 to Old House and SC 462 to SC 170. In 1998, US 278 was rerouted onto new routing along the west side of Hilton Head Island; known as the Cross Island Parkway, the toll road provides quicker access to the far south end of the island. The old alignment, in Hilton Head Island, became US 278 Business.

It was a conventional, two-bay biplane with slightly staggered wings of unequal span. The aircraft was provided with two open cockpits in tandem and fixed tailskid undercarriage, but many were built for the Navy with twin floats replacing the wheels. During the course of the war, Model Rs were used for general liaison and communication duties, as well for observation, training, and as air ambulances. In practice, the Curtiss powerplants supplied with these aircraft proved insufficient and were mostly replaced with Liberty engines. The Navy's Model R-3 floatplane had extended-span, three-bay wings, and was intended for use as a torpedo bomber.

In 1915 he completed his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he also studied psychoanalysis, sociology, education, and biology. Siegfried Bernfeld was of Jewish ancestry. While still a student, he was involved in the psychoanalytical movement, and later became an important member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. During the First World War, when Vienna became home to over 100,000 refugees, many of them Jews from Galicia, Bernfeld became interested in developing new forms of Jewish education catering to the needs of these young Jews; in summer 1917 the Zionist organization in Vienna recruited him to lead its education and youth work.Rechter, David (February 1996). Bubermania': The Jewish Youth Movement in Vienna, 1917‚Äì1919\\". Modern Judaism. Vol. 16, No. 1. p. 25-45; here: p. 26, 28. From 1917 to 1921 Bernfeld was in charge of Zionistischen Zentralrat f√ºr West- √ñsterreich (Zionist Central Council for Western-Austria), and in 1919 he headed a project called Kinderheim Baumgarten, which provided housing and education for 300 Jewish children from Poland, who were displaced during the war. From 1922 until 1925 he practiced psychoanalysis in Vienna, where one of his analysands was the British scientist Lionel Penrose. From 1925 to 1932 he worked at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. Subsequently he returned to Vienna, and with the threat of Nazism, went into exile in Menton on the French Riviera, where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards he emigrated to the United States, where he worked as an educator in San Francisco. In a 1931 article published on the journal edited by Freud, Bernfeld defined psychoanalysis coiningOccurrences on Google Books. the German term Spurenwissenschaft (\\"science of traces\\"). He is also remembered for his research in providing a link between psychoanalysis and educational theory. He was interested in the role of education, and how it related to issues such as social change and social inequality. He was an early proponent of Freudo-Marxism, and developed theories regarding the correlation of psychoanalysis with socialism. He regarded educational reformer Gustav Wyneken (1875-1964) an early influence in his career, and was a member of several liberal and \\"youth culture\\" organizations. Among his written works was an influential book on infant psychology called Psychologie des S√§uglings, and a 1925 work on educational theory titled Sisyphos, in which Bernfeld advocates a non-authoritarian educational system that stresses the importance of the instinctual life and the needs of the student. He also published an important work on psychoanalytic interpretation called Der Begriff der \\"Deutung\\" in der Psychoanalyse, in which he explains the correlation of psychoanalysis to scientific principles. Later in his career, he published several articles about the early scientific work of Sigmund Freud.  References External links * Biographical entry by R.

The Audiencia was created by royal decree on December 13, 1527, and was seated in the viceregal capital of Mexico City. The First Audiencia was dissolved by the crown for its bungling and corruption and the crown established the Second Audiencia in 1530.Peggy K. Liss, Mexico under Spain, 1521-1556: Society and the Origins of Nationality. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1975, 52. Another Audiencia was created in Guadalajara in western Mexico in 1548. Assertion of Royal Control After the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521 conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s exercised power in New Spain as its first European governor and proceeded to allocate rewards to Spaniards who had participated in the victory.Liss, Mexico Under Spain p. 48. He initially established a government in the town of Coyoac√°n, south of Lake Texcoco, because Tenochtitlan was in ruins after the conquest. From here he governed with the title of Captain General and Justicia Mayor. In his letters to the king, he explained and justified his actions, arguing that it was necessary to grant rewards of encomiendas to conquerors in order to persuade them to remain in the area now under Spanish control rather than see them depart for conquests elsewhere.Hern√°n Cort√©s, Letters from Mexico, Anthony Pagden, editor and translator. New Haven: Yale University Press 2001, pp. 279-80. The crown sent treasury officials to New Spain, asserting the right of the crown to the revenues from the newly conquered lands. During Cort√©s's expedition to Honduras (1524‚Äì26), treasury officials were left in charge and the political situation descended into chaos. After Cort√©s's return to Mexico City in 1526, the crown realized that to assert its power over him that a higher level of royal authority was needed and created the Audiencia of Mexico.Liss, Mexico Under Spain, p. 51. The first Audiencia in Mexico was created in 1528 and headed by crown official Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n. Hern√°n Cort√©s, who as leader of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, had accrued considerable wealth and power after the conquest that was not effectively checked by crown treasury officials. By setting up the Audiencia the crown sought to limit Cort√©s's personal power by creating the high court as an effective instrument of royal power.Liss, Mexico Under Spain, p. 51Ida Altman, The War for Mexico's West: Indians and Spaniards in New Galicia, 1524-1550. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2010, p. 21. Guzm√°n was opposed by the first bishop of Mexico, Juan de Zum√°rraga, an ally of Cort√©sAltman, War for Mexico's West, p. 22 Guzm√°n's tenure as the president of the Audiencia was marked by ruthless attacks on his political rivals, corruption, and extreme violence against Indians. One scholar calls him \\"a natural gangster.\\"J.H. Parry,The Audiencia of New Galicia in the Sixteenth Century. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1948. However, structurally the crown had set up a conflictive situation between the conquerors turned encomenderos and the high court determined to assert royal authority. The crown's choice of Nu√±o de Guzm√°n as president of the Audiencia was a major blunder. Guzm√°n largely ignored the crown's instructions and intentions to assert royal authority against the conqueror group and their rewards with Guzm√°n acting as a rival to accrue power and wealth to himself and his retinue via the power of the Audiencia.Liss, Mexico Under Spain, p. 52. The crown rectified its blunder and dissolved the First Audiencia in 1530 and established the Second Audiencia with judges who recognized crown authority;Liss, Mexico Under Spain p. 52-55 this body functioned until the end of the colonial era. In 1532, the Viceroyalty of New Spain was created, although the first Viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, would not arrive in Mexico until 1535. The Viceroy took over the executive functions of government from the Audiencia and served as its president. In the following decade, as more mainland areas were conquered, a second Audiencia was created in Guadalajara, the provincial capital of the Kingdom of New Galicia, in 1548.Ida Altman, The War for Mexico's West: Indians and Spaniards in New Galicia, 1524-1550.

FLF Television Paris) and based on Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. The show was first aired in Germany in October 1964 under the title Robinson Crusoe as four 90-minute episodes by co-producers ZDF television, and syndicated in the USA the same year. It was first aired in the UK in 1965 as a 13-part serial. This English dubbed version produced by Henry Deutschmeister also had a new musical soundtrack composed by Robert Mellin and P. Reverberi replacing the music composed by Georges Van Parys for the French/German original. The production concentrated not only on events on the island but included Crusoe's other adventures, told in flashback. The English-language version's theme music, which the BBC requested before they would buy the serial, has been praised. Radio commentator Glenn Mitchell said \\"The theme tune, with its rumbling introductory notes suggesting the rolling waves of the on-screen title sequence remains distinctive, as does the full incidental score, comprising numerous cues that in each case represent some part of Crusoe's existence. The score combines the maritime idiom of the late 17th and early 18th centuries with some very 1960s influences‚Äî(later, composer Gian Piero Reverberi's Rond√≤ Veneziano re-imagined Vivaldi for the 20th century, a recognisably similar project.)\\"Glenn Mitchell, Robinson Crusoe:Rescued Again, Radio 4, 20 January 2011 It has since been recreated by bands such as The Art of Noise. Description After its debut in 1965 it became a staple part of the BBC's school summer holiday schedules. Often shown Mondays to Fridays in the mid '70s, it was last screened in the early 1980s, after which the BBC's contract for repeat screenings expired. It is the story of a young Englishman's struggle for survival on an unknown desert island, and his recollections of his adventures prior to the shipwreck that brought him there, in particular his involvement with slave traders. He has his pet dog Dick, a parrot and a goat for company. In the latter half of the story a group of cannibals arrive on his island; he repels them by means of explosives, and in the process rescues a man from becoming their next meal; he names him Friday. In the end he comes to terms with his less than exemplary past, and becomes a better man thanks to his experiences on the island, befriending Friday and putting his life in order. The serial was filmed on Gran Canaria, the 3rd largest of the Canary Islands, off the coast of Morocco. Robinson's Island locations were shot at Playa del Ingles on the southern tip of Gran Canaria; the Moroccan scenes were filmed further along the coast at Playa de Maspalomas and the Dunes of Maspalomas; the small village of Tejeda located inland at the notional centre of Gran Canaria was used as the location for Robinson's Plantation in Brazil. Most of this footage was shot mute because of the lack of dialogue and the time it saved on location, the sound being dubbed on later. The English locations (York/Hull) were shot in Normandy, France. The filming took four months to complete. For the Gran Canaria footage a small 11 man film crew was used, all of whom also played small parts in the serial, such as assistant director Luc Andrieux who took the part of Kasir the fishmonger. This was Austrian, Salzburg-born,Robinson Crusoe :Rescued Again, presented by Glenn Mitchell, BBC Radio 4, 20 January 2011 actor Robert Hoffmann's first professional acting job after leaving the French actors school in Paris in 1964. (In Defoe's novel Crusoe is only 27, and his father a German √©migr√© from Bremen, surnamed Kreutznaer, so that Crusoe is an anglicization of this name.) Franco London Film made three different cuts of the show available (four-part, six-part and thirteen-part versions) to accommodate the broadcasting requirements of countries buying the serial. The success of this production led to a series of 16 French/German co-production adaptations of classic adventure and children's novels between 1964 and 1983, for ZDF and ORTF in France. These serials are known by German fans as the ZDF four parters. The man behind these mini epics was German producer/writer Walter Ulbrich. Franco London Film, in association with Deropa Films (Germany), were involved in the next four serials: Don Quixote the Man of La Mancha, produced by Walter Ulbrich and Henry Deutschmeister in 1965 (the last to be made in monochrome); Die Schatzinsel/L'ile au Tresor in 1966, an adaptation of Treasure Island that starred English actor Ivor Dean as Long John Silver; Les Aventures de Tom Sawyer in 1968 (broadcast in 13 parts on BBC1 from 1970 to 1974); and finally Die Lederstrumpf Erzahlungen an adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's novels featuring Natty Bumppo, collectively known as The Leatherstocking Tales, (including The Last of the Mohicans) in 1969. The serial has been dubbed into German, English, French and Italian.

VHS and DVD releases *In 1997, the complete series was released on VHS video by Network in four volumes. This was thanks to the work of Tim Beddows who tracked down the only known English language prints in a French film vault. However, these were 16mm prints, since the original 35mm prints used by the BBC between 1965 and 1982 had been junked, and no other 35mm prints could be found. *In 2006, the four- part German version was released on DVD, dubbed in German by Concorde Home Entertainment and restored from 35mm prints. *In 2007, Network released the series on DVD. Once again these were the recovered 16mm prints; these also included a French print of part one with burnt in Portuguese subtitles and an interview with Robert Hoffman from TV show V.I.P. (1997).

Ahr is a wine region (Anbaugebiet) for quality wine in Germany,Wein.de (German Agricultural Society): Ahr , read on January 2, 2008 and is located in the valley of the river Ahr, a tributary of Rhine, and is situated in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. With only of vines as of 2008,German Wine Institute: German wine statistics 2009/2010 it is one of smaller of Germany's 13 regions. Despite its northern location (it is for example situated north of Mosel region) it primarily produces red wines, and red grape varieties account for 86% of the vineyard area, which is more than in any other German wine region. History It is believed that vines were cultivated in the Ahr valley already in Roman times, as is the case with nearby Mosel, although definite documentary evidence to this effect seems to be lacking.Wein-Plus Glossar: Ahr, read on January 22, 2013 However, a property list of the Benedictine Pr√ºm Abbey drawn up in the year 893 AD, called the Pr√ºmer Urbar, lists vineyards in eight Ahr locations, so at least at this time, winemaking in the Ahr region was established. Geography and climate The narrow Ahr river valley is responsible for the region's favoured mesoclimate. Situated between 50¬∞ and 51¬∞ north, Ahr is the world's most northern region dominated by red wine grapes. So far north, very good sites with a warm microclimate are needed to properly ripen red wine grapes, and the Ahr vineyards are said to have a \\"Mediterranean\\" microclimate. Most vineyards are located on terraced slopes facing southwest to southeast along the middle and lower portions of river Ahr, over a stretch of 25 kilometers, from Altenahr to the Rhine.J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, p 8, Oxford University Press 2006, The wine-growing parts of the Ahr valley enjoy protection from the Eifel mountains resulting in a favoured mesoclimate. Soils vary between slate, basalt and greywacke clay of volcanic origin. Ahr consists of a single district (Bereich) called Walporzheim-Ahrtal, only one collective vineyard site (Gro√ülage) called Klosterberg, and 43 single vineyard sites. Grape varieties Sp√§tburgunder, outside Germany more commonly known as Pinot noir, is the dominant grape variety of the Ahr wine region. At 61.3% or in 2008, Ahr grows a higher proportion of the much- appreciated Sp√§tburgunder (Pinot noir) than any other German wine region. Other common grape varieties, by area of cultivation in 2008 are: * Portugieser, 43 ha (7.7%) * Riesling, 43 ha (7.7%) * Fr√ºhburgunder, 35 ha (6.3%) * Regent, 19 ha (3.4%) * Dornfelder, 19 ha (3.4%) * M√ºller-Thurgau, 15 ha (2.7%) * Domina, 10 ha (1.8%) Wine style While Ahr primarily grew red wine before the current red wine trend in Germany, until the 1980s the wines were almost invariably very light-colored, bordering on ros√©, and often were significantly sweet. While this style of wine was perhaps rather unimpressive by international standards, Ahr could rely on its vicinity to the populous Ruhr Area to sell its small production to weekend tourists. In the 1980s, Werner N√§kel of Weingut Meyer-N√§kel started to experiment with extended maceration and a significant influence of oak, which then was a style of red wine which hardly existed in Germany.Wein-Plus Glossar: Meyer-N√§kel, read on January 22, 2013 After his wines won their first award in 1989, his style was followed by many other Ahr wineries as well as in other German regions. This style is now firmly established as the style of the best wines of the top Ahr producers: dry, fairly tannic and with a heavy oak influence.J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, p 659-660, Oxford University Press 2006, In comparison with Pinot noir wines of Burgundy, Ahr wines tend to have a paler red color and being more oak-dominated. The top red wines used to be classified as dry (trocken) Auslese, but nowadays they are either called Grosses Gew√§chs or are classified as plain Qualit√§tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete and are sold under estate-specific wine names. The best red wines of Ahr are quite expensive, and are routinely priced significantly higher than Germany's top dry Rieslings. Prices in excess of 50 euro are not uncommon for the top of the range at more well-known producers, although cheaper entry wines also are produced. Due to the limited production, and the high domestic demand for red wines in Germany, Ahr wines have only limited international (export) availability.

Merrell joined the Army from his birthplace of Staten Island in August 1944 (a week after his 18th birthday),WWII Army Enlistment Records and by April 18, 1945, was serving as a private in Company I, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. On that day, near Lohe (a suburb of Nuremberg), Germany, he singlehandedly attacked German positions that were firing on his unit. He disabled two enemy machine gun emplacements and killed nearly two dozen German soldiers before he was himself killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor (now on exhibit at Fort Wadsworth) ten months later, on February 26, 1946. Merrell, aged 18 at his death, was buried in Saint Peters Cemetery, West New Brighton, New York.

Additional honors A former SS barracks in N√ºrnberg, Germany was acquired by the US Army and renamed the Merrell Barracks. The Merrell Barracks was vacated and returned to the German government in September 1992. A Staten Island Ferry boat was named after him (in service until 1982), as was the US Navy Freighter, the USNS Pvt. Joseph F Merrell. This ship served as a cargo ship during the Korean War and made expeditions to Antarctica in 1957 and again during operations Deep Freeze in 1962, '63, '64, and '65.

West of Williston is SC 781, which connects back with US 278; the routing allows travelers to bypass Aiken all together between Williston and Augusta. Traveling in a southeasterly direction, it goes through the cities and towns of Williston, Blackville, Denmark, Bamberg, Branchville and St. George, where connects with I-95. Continuing east, it passes through Dorchester and begins to parallel with I-26 in a southeasterly direction through Summerville. It crosses into Charleston County at Lincolnville, where the highway skirts just inches south of the Berkeley County line. In North Charleston, US 78 shares a concurrency with US 52, as it connects with I-526. Entering Charleston, it splits with US 52 and goes south along King Street; its eastern terminus at Line Street, a block away from US 52's eastern/southern terminus and nearby to I-26/US 17 interchange. US 78 is a predominantly two-lane rural highway connecting much of the Lowcountry. Wider sections (four-lanes or more) are found between North Augusta-Aiken, St. George and North Charleston. Though it provides the most direct route between Augusta and Charleston (using US 278/SC 781 to bypass Aiken), it is not a busy route because of the many cities and towns it goes through. History Established in 1927 as an original US highway, it traveled closely as it does today; from North Augusta to Charleston, connecting the cities and towns of Aiken, Bamberg, St. George, and North Charleston. By 1931, US 78 was rerouted north of Summerville and Lincolnville, leaving Richardson Avenue/Lincoln Avenue. Around 1939, US 78 was realigned from Meeting Street to Rivers Street, south of Durant Avenue in the Charleston area. Also in 1939, US 78 was fully paved in the state, its last unpaved section was between St. George and US 178\\\\. By 1952, US 78 was placed on new four-lane highway bypassing Clearwater, Burnettown, and Gloverville; also by same year a new bridge was constructed over the Savannah River, leaving Fifth Street Bridge. By 1967, US 78 was adjusted to bypass south of mainstreet Blackville, leaving a secondary road, but was later upgraded as a connector (signed as a business loop).

History The area which was to become Duke's Place was occupied until its dissolution in 1531 by the Priory of Holy Trinity, Christ Church. Henry VIII then gave the land to Sir Thomas Audley who cleared it and built houses on the site, although fragments of the medieval buildings still survived at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The area was eventually inherited by Audley's son-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, from whom the name \\"Duke's Place\\" is derived. In the early 17th century the residents of the former priory precinct, finding worship at St Katherine Cree \\"uncongenial\\"Vanished churches of the City of London Huelin, G.: London, Guildhall Library Publishing 1996 sought permission from the king, James I to build a parish church for themselves. Permission was granted, and the new church, dedicated to St James in tribute to the king, was consecrated on 2 January 1622. The patronage of the new church belonged to the lord mayor and commonalty of London, and the parish claimed exemption from the Bishop of London in ecclesiastical matters. It was notable in the late 17th century as a \\"marriage factory\\", with multiple ceremonies each day. The church survived the Great Fire of London,The Churches of the City of London. Reynolds, H.

George Godwin, writing in 1839, called it \\"a plain warehouse like construction of brick, quite unworthy of description\\". It was 65 feet long and 42 feet wide, and divided into nave and aisles by wooden columns supporting entablatures and a flat ceiling. The stained glass in the east window, included the arms of Sir Edward Barkham, the Lord Mayor who had been instrumental in the establishment of the church. There was a tower; Godwin suspected its trefoil openings were survivals from the priory building. An organ (\\"exceedingly small\\", according to Godwin ) was installed in 1815 and the church restored in 1823. The poverty of the area and its increasing Jewish populationSee Bevis Marks Synagogue made it increasingly difficult to raise funds to maintain the church; Godwin described it as being \\"in a very dirty and dilapidated state\\". In 1874, under the 1860 Union of Benefices Act, it was demolished and the parish joined to that of St Katherine Cree. The site of the church is now occupied by the Sir John Cass School.

The Russian Soviet Government Bureau (1919-1921), sometimes known as the \\"Soviet Bureau,\\" was an unofficial diplomatic organization established by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the United States during the Russian Civil War. The Soviet Bureau primarily functioned as a trade and information agency of the Soviet government. Suspected of engaging in political subversion, the Soviet Bureau was raided by law enforcement authorities at the behest of the Lusk Committee of the New York State legislature in 1919. The Bureau was terminated early in 1921. History=Establishment= Sometime in January 1919 a courier acting on behalf of the government of Soviet Russia contacted Ludwig C.A.K. Martens, a respected editor of Novyi Mir, the newspaper of the Russian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America, appointing him its representative in the United States.Archibald E. Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism: Its History, Purpose and Tactics with an Exposition and Discussion of the Steps being Taken and Required to Curb It ... : Part 1: Revolutionary and Subversive Movements Abroad and At Home, Vol. 1. Albany, NY: Lyon, 1920; pg. 643. Arrangements were made to organize an office staff, including a commercial department headed by industrialist A.A. Heller, a diplomatic department headed by former head of the Finnish Information Bureau, Santeri Nuorteva, and a legal department headed by Socialist Party leader Morris Hillquit. On March 19, 1919, Martens contacted the U.S. State Department in an effort to present the diplomatic credentials prepared for him by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin.Todd J. Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare: The Lusk Committee and New York's Crusade Against Radicalism, 1919-1923. New York: Routledge, 2003; pg. 37. Chicherin authorized Martens to take over all real estate and property formerly held by the embassy and consulates of the Russian Provisional Government, to receive and disburse money on behalf of the Soviet government, and to solicit and answer all legal claims on behalf of Soviet Russia. With the economy of Soviet Russia on the verge of collapse, the administration of Woodrow Wilson was reluctant to grant formal diplomatic recognition, however, instead maintaining a wait-and-see attitude while allowing the Soviet government to establish a temporary agency in New York City.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 38. The Russian Soviet Government Bureau (RSGB) was the stop-gap organization established by Martens in lieu of a recognized diplomatic embassy. The Bureau maintained offices at the \\"World Tower Building,\\" located at 110 West 40th Street in Manhattan.Stevenson (ed.) Revolutionary Radicalism, vol. 1, pg. 639. A staff of 35 was hired, including a former editor of Novyi Mir and partisan of the Communist Labor Party, Gregory Weinstein, as office manager.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pg. 162. The nature and activity of the Soviet Bureau ventured into uncharted water, as historian Theodore Draper noted: > \\"There were no precedents for Martens' bureau. It was set up as a diplomatic > mission, without diplomatic recognition. It was made up mostly of Americans, > and the others, like Martens himself, had been cut off for many years from > direct contact with Russia. couriers constituted the only method of > communication, but they were so slow and uncertain that it took two months > for Martens to get in touch with the Soviet government.\\" A secret mission to Russia in March 1919 conducted by Wilson administration envoy William C. Bullitt to assess the economic and political system there ended in a negative report which accentuated various atrocities committed in the name of the Bolshevik regime, effectively removing any chance of formal recognition of the Martens initiative. Despite the decision to forego formal recognition, the State Department did not immediately seek the removal of Martens, instead opting to advise Americans to use \\"extreme caution\\" in their dealings with the Soviet Bureau.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 39. =Trade agency= With its chances of gaining official recognition clearly dashed from the outset, the Soviet Bureau concentrated its efforts on building commercial contacts with American businesses. Martens sought to take over assets previously held by the Provisional Government and to use these funds as part of a $200 million program to acquire commodities and capital goods for the struggling Bolshevik government of Russia.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 45. Martens declared that with the overthrow of the Provisional Government in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the position of ambassador Boris Bakhmeteff had become vacant and the assets formerly held legally transferred to the new regime. While the effort to obtain massive assets came to naught, contacts with American companies eager to do business with Soviet Russia came fast and furious. By the end of the first month, Martens' right-hand man, the Finnish socialist Santeri Nuorteva, declared to the press that \\"we are swamped with requests for commercial connections.\\"New York Times, March 28, 1919. Cited in Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 46. This tempo was accelerated in April 1919, when the RSGB mailed letters of inquiry to 5,000 American firms and circulated press kits to 200 trade-oriented newspapers.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 56. Numerous firms took interest and sent their representatives to New York for direct discussions with Martens and his associates, including such industrial giants as the Ford Motor Company, meatpackers Armour and Company and Swift and Company, agricultural machinery maker International Harvester, cotton goods maker Marshall Field and Company, and Sears, Roebuck and Company.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pp. 56-57. Indeed, during its brief period of active operations as a Soviet trade agency, terminated by a June 12, 1919 raid, the RSGB was contacted by an estimated 941 American companies seeking to sell products to or to obtain products from Soviet Russia.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 58. By the end of 1919, the Russian Soviet Government Bureau had signed contracts totaling nearly $25 million.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 62. This proved to be the first of a growing flood of commerce, with Soviet contracts with American companies topping the $300 million mark by May 1920. =Propaganda agency= Soviet Russia, launched as a publication of the RSGB, was later turned over to the Friends of Soviet Russia organization. In addition to its role as the trade agency of the Soviet Russian government in America, the RSGB also served a propaganda function, attempting to counteract \\"the campaign of deliberate misrepresentation which is being waged by enemies of the Russian workers\\" in the press.\\"To the Reader,\\" Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 1 (June 7, 1919), pg. 1. The Soviet Bureau published a weekly informational bulletin from its earliest days, moving to a magazine format with the title Soviet Russia: A Weekly Devoted to the Spread of Truth About Russia effective June 9, 1919.Masthead, Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 1 (June 7, 1919), pg. 1. Soviet Russia included reprints of speeches by RSGB officials,See, for example, Santeri Nuorteva, \\"Trade Possibilities in Soviet Russia: Speech at the Knit Goods Manufacturers' Convention in Philadelphia, June 4th,\\" Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 2 (June 14, 1919), pp. 9-10. news and commentary supporting the Soviet side in the ongoing Russian Civil War,See, for example, Max M. Zippin, \\"The Antisemitism of the Koltchak Government,\\" Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 3 (June 21, 1919), pp. 4-6. and the pronouncements of top Soviet government officials on matters of trade and world politics.See, for example, Yuri Larin, \\"Economic Reconstruction in Soviet Russia at the End of February, 1919,\\" Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 3 (June 21, 1919), pp. 8-9. While the publication of such fare seemed reasonable to the Soviet Bureau and its political supporters, the presence of a Bolshevik propaganda agency in the heart of New York City was a proverbial red flag to conservative opponents of the Soviet regime. The Russian Soviet Government Bureau became a top target of the so-called Lusk Committee established by the New York state legislature to investigate radical activities in the state of New York. =Relationship with the American Communist movement= Martens and his staff accepted a number of invitations to speak at radical meetings in New York City and elsewhere, activity which drew the ire of conservative forces in America.Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism, vol. 1, pg. 644. Martens retained close contact and warm relations with the Socialist Party of America (SPA) and the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP) which emerged from the SPA's organized left wing late in 1919. Relations with the rival Communist Party of America (CPA) were frosty, however, as the powerful Russian Federation of that organization sought to control the activities and purse of Martens and the Soviet Bureau in America. A historian has summarized the perspective of the communist wing of the Russian colony in America neatly: > \\"The leaders of the Russian federation ... did not hesitate to extend their > jurisdiction over the official Soviet agency ... They felt that commercial > and trade relations were foolish objectives. Only the spread of the > proletarian revolution mattered. If the revolution conquered outside Russia, > then commercial and trade relations would come of themselves. If the world > revolution failed, commercial and trade relations could not help the Russian > Revolution to survive. In effect, the American Russians had taken literally > what the Russian leaders themselves were saying about the necessity for a > world revolution to save the Russian Revolution, and in doing so, they > became more doctrinaire than their teachers.\\"Draper, The Roots of American > Communism, pp. 162-163. While Commissar of Foreign Affairs Chicherin ultimately sided with Martens in maintaining financial and organizational independence from the CPA, relations between the Soviet Bureau and the party were stilted. =Raid= On March 28, 1919 and April 11, 1919 The New York Times published articles urging to close what it deemed the illegal representation of the Soviet Bureau. A number of government agencies conducted inquiries of the RSGB prior to its office being raided, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Directorate of Military Intelligence, and the War Trade Board.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pg. 63. Information was provided as requested, with Soviet Bureau official Evans Clark noting to assistant director of the War Trade Board G.M. Bodman at a meeting on April 25, 1919, that the bureau \\"had nothing to conceal\\" and was \\"glad to furnish information to those entitled to have it.\\" Additionally, Martens and his lawyer Charles Recht had met personally with officials of the Department of Justice in April and May, while Clark travelled to Washington, D.C. to consult with the personal secretary of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer.Pfannestiel, Rethinking the Red Scare, pp. 63-64. While federal officials seem to have taken a \\"wait and see\\" attitude towards the Soviet Bureau, New York state politicians and law enforcement authorities were motivated by a more urgent agenda. On Thursday, June 12, 1919, the RSGB's offices on West 40th Street were suddenly raided by New York Police at the behest of the state legislature's newly established Joint Legislative Committee Investigating Seditious Activities (commonly known as the \\"Lusk Committee\\").Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism,\\" vol. 1, pg. 641. A search warrant was served and \\"every shred of written or printed paper\\" was removed from the premises,Introductory editorial, Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 3 (June 21, 1919), pg. 3. material which was later parsed at the Lusk Committee's leisure for evidence of illegal seditious activity and further radical connections for the committee to explore. The Soviet Bureau vociferously protested the Lusk Committee's action: > \\"The invasion of the office of the Russian Soviet Government was altogether > unwarranted and illegal. The Russian Soviet Government Bureau has > conscientiously refrained from interfering in American affairs. Its > activities have always been open to investigation by anyone honestly in > search of information about Soviet Russia or about the activities of the > Bureau. Only the existing state of hysterical reaction diligently nursed by > a persistent campaign of slander against Soviet Russia can explain why such > drastic steps were taken in a case where a simple inquiry would have brought > out all the information necessary ‚Äî without breaking the law and the first > principles of international hospitality.\\" Martens was subsequently subpoenaed and called before the committee to give testimony. =Hearings= The organization was a subject of hearings in United States Senate from January through March 1920. On December 17, 1920, the United States Department of Labor decided to deport Martens. In January 1921 Martens finally left the United States. Work of the organization stopped with the departure of its leader. FootnotesKey participants * Boris Roustam Bek * Evans Clark * Jacob W. Hartmann * A.A. Heller * Leo A.

Created in 1972, the medal is presented to both living and deceased individuals deemed to have performed \\"acts of conspicuous courage in circumstances of great peril,\\" and grants recipients the ability to use post-nominal letters; for Anglophones SC, and for Francophones √âC. Design The Star of Courage is in the form of a wide silver compass star Celeste with a maple leaf in each angle. On the obverse is a gold roundel at the centre of the star, bearing a maple leaf surrounded by a laurel wreath. The reverse bears on the upper arm the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch beneath a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour, and the inscription COURAGE. Below this is engraved the name and rank of the recipient. This medallion is worn on the left chest, on a wide ribbon coloured red with two vertical blue stripes: for men, hung from a bar, and for women, on a ribbon bow, both pinned to the left chest. Should an individual already possessing a Star of Courage be awarded the medal again for subsequent acts of bravery, he or she is granted a medal bar, in gold and bearing a maple leaf, for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended; a small gold maple leaf is also added to the ribbon bar. Eligibility and receipt On 1 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, created the Star of Courage to recognize acts of great bravery. Any person, living or deceased, may be nominated for the Star of Courage; it is not necessary that the act of bravery take place in Canada, nor must the person who carried out the act be a Canadian. However, the event must have involved Canadians and/or Canadian interests. Nominations can be made no later than two years following either the act of bravery itself or the conclusion of any coroner's or court's inquest into the events for which the person was nominated. , the Star of Courage has been presented to 461 people.

Licensed to Wenatchee, Washington, United States, the station serves the Wenatchee area. The station is currently owned by Alpha Media LLC, through Alpha Media Licensee LLC, and features programming from ESPN Radio. KKRT's programming is simulcasted on sister station KWIQ AM 1020 in Moses Lake North, Washington. History KKRT has changed its name various times since its debut. KKRT first went on the air as KSGA on the first of July 1985, but changed its call sign to KEYK in early January 1987. On the thirteenth of October 1988, the call sign was changed again to its current name of KKRT when it changed from its classic country format to old standards as \\"K-Heart\\". On occasion, during the early 1990s, KKRT was used as a back-up station to carry Seattle Mariners radio broadcast from KWWW-AM, and later, KZPH when there were conflicts with broadcasts for the Washington State Cougars Football Team and the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1993, the station dropped the standards format, and carried the audio feed of CNN Headline News. It was rebranded as \\"CNN AM 900\\". In 1996, KKRT became the full time Mariners affiliate, and changed to an all sports format as \\"SportsRadio 900\\" carrying programming from One-on-One Sports and ESPN Radio. The station also later picked up the local rights to WSU football (which ended in 2015, when the broadcasts moved to KPQ) and the Sonics (which ended after the 2006‚Äì07 season, one year before the \\"relocation\\" to Oklahoma City). In 2000, KKRT dropped One-on-One and started carrying the entire ESPN Radio schedule. Today, along with the Mariners, KKRT is the regional affiliate for the Washington Huskies Football Team and the Gonzaga Men's Basketball Team.

Stems may reach up to diameter on old plants; in forest habitats they may become horizontal with erect side branches. Young plants have a single unbranched stem with a rosette of leaves until the growing tip flowers or is damaged, after which it branches, producing two or more new stems; thereafter, branching increases with subsequent flowering episodes.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening 2: 96. Macmillan . The leaves are glossy green, lanceolate, long and wide; small leaves are erect to spreading, and larger leaves usually drooping under their weight. The flowers are produced in panicles long, the individual flowers are diameter, with a six-lobed corolla, pink at first, opening white with a fine red or purple central line on each of the lobes; they are highly fragrant, and popular with pollinating insects. The fruit is an orange-red berry diameter, containing several seeds. Cultivation Inflorescence of Dracaena fragrans 'Massangeana' Dracaena fragrans 'Massangeana' in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S. In Africa, D. fragrans is commonly grown as a hedge plant. It is suited to frost- free climates and USDA Hardiness zones 10-11. Elsewhere, it is primarily popular as a houseplant and valued for its tolerance of a wide range of indoor conditions from full light to low light. It is also very tolerant of neglect. The NASA Clean Air Study indicated that the plant aided removal of indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.Wolverton, B. C. 1996. How to Grow Fresh Air. New York: Penguin Books. The plant is known as \\"masale\\" to the Chagga people of Tanzania, who regard it as holy. In cultivation in the Neotropics, a few generalist hummingbird species like the sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea) visit the flowers.Baza Mendon√ßa, Luciana & dos Anjos, Luiz. (2005). Beija-flores (Aves, Trochilidae) e seus recursos florais em uma √°rea urbana do Sul do Brasil [Hummingbirds (Aves, Trochilidae) and their flowers in an urban area of southern Brazil]. [Portuguese with English abstract] Revista Brasileira de Zoologia 22 (1): 51‚Äì59. PDF fulltext =Cultivars= Several cultivars have variegated foliage. 'Massangeana', also commonly denominated \\"Mass Cane\\", has a bright yellow central stripe on the foliage. 'Compacta' is more compact and suitable for indoor cultivation. Other popular cultivars include 'Janet Craig', 'Lemon Lime', and 'Warneckei' ('Warneckii'), which are often sold under the synonym D. deremensis. The cultivars 'Lemon Lime', ‚ÄòMassangeana‚Äô, and 'Warneckei' bear the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Propagation= Dracaena fragrans is propagated by cutting segments of old stems long, drying them, and then inserting them into moist sand until they root. New growth, typically being two or three shoots, comes from old foliar scars at the top of the stem. Etymology and synonymy The species name refers to the fragrant flowers, while the English name derives from a perceived resemblance of the stem to a corn (Zea mays) stalk. Synonyms include Aletris fragrans L. (basionym), Cordyline fragrans (L.) Planch., Pleomele fragrans (L.) Salisb., Sansevieria fragrans (L.) Jacq., Dracaena deremensis Engl., Dracaena smithii Hook.f., and Dracaena ugandensis Baker. Other English names include striped dracaena (for variegated cultivars), corn plant (for the cultivar 'Massangeana';), Chinese money tree, and fortune plant.MacDonald, Elvin \\"The World Book of House Plants\\" pp.238 Popular Books The plant is known as \\"‡∂∂‡∑ù‡∂≠‡∂Ω‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∑É‡∑ä - bothal gas\\" (meaning \\"bottle tree\\") in Sinhala, in Sri Lanka.

His Moody 33 (mk 1) centre cockpit design originated from his work in 1973 with A H Moody & Sons Ltd at Swanwick near Southampton. The boats were built in production by Marine Projects (Plymouth) Ltd, and led to the development of successive models: Moody 30, 36 and 39, all built at Plymouth. The custom Moody 42 was built by Moody's firm in Swanwick, with a centre cockpit and aft cockpit/deck saloon variants. In 1972 Angus Primrose designed the Warrior 35, built by Trident Marine Ltd. The long keel hull was also developed in various forms as the aft cockpit Challenger 35 and the deck saloon version the Voyager 35.

Career  Granahan worked at WPTS in Pittston as a radio announcer and disc jockey in his youth. His Elvis Presley-like voice got him a job recording demos of songs submitted to Presley. Granahan was offered a contract with Atlantic Records in 1957 as a rockabilly artist under the name Jerry Grant, but his release sank without a trace, and another release shortly after on Mark Records was also a flop. In 1958, Granahan teamed with publisher Tommy Volando on Sunbeam Records, and recorded the single \\"No Chemise Please\\". The song became a nationwide hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 23 on the Billboard \\"Top 100 Sides\\".\\"Top 100 Sides\\", Billboard, June 30, 1958. p. 34. Retrieved February 10, 2018. None of his next four singles for Sunbeam were sales successes; however. Around this time, Granahan co-wrote the song \\"Click-Clack\\" with Dave Alldred of The Rhythm Orchids. A demo of the tune reached Dick Clark, as well as Tony Mammarella, who had just founded Swan Records. Because of contractual obligations, Granahan released the song under the alias Dickey Doo & the Don'ts on Swan, and Clark guaranteed it airplay on American Bandstand. \\"Click-Clack\\" reached No. 28 on the Billboard \\"Top 100 Sides\\",\\"Top 100 Sides\\", Billboard, March 10, 1958. p. 52.

In 1959, Granahan also managed a regional hit in the U.S. Northeast with the single \\"Let the Rumors Fly\\", released on Gone Records.
