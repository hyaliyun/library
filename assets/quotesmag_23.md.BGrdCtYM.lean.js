The goal of the program was to apply concepts from artificial intelligence to the problem of designing and implementing computer software. Software would be described by models in very high level languages (essentially equivalent to first order logic) and then transformation rules would transform the specification into efficient code. The air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control weapons systems and other command and control systems using this method. As software was becoming ever more critical to USAF weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military, as well as for information technology in other major US industries. History In the early 1980s the United States Air Force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft. The air force commissioned a group of researchers from the artificial intelligence and formal methods communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development. The report described a vision for a new approach to software development. Rather than define specifications with diagrams and manually transform them to code as was the current process, the Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA) vision was to define specifications in very high level languages and then to use transformation rules to gradually refine the specification into efficient code on heterogeneous platforms. Each step in the design and refinement of the system would be recorded as part of an integrated repository. In addition to the artifacts of software development the processes, the various definitions and transformations, would also be recorded in a way that they could be analyzed and also replayed later as needed. The idea was that each step would be a transformation that took into account various non-functional requirements for the implemented system. For example, requirements to use specific programming languages such as Ada or to harden code for real time mission critical fault tolerance. The air force decided to fund further research on this vision through their Rome Air Development Center laboratory at Griffiss air force base in New York. The majority of the early research was conducted at the Kestrel Institute in Northern California (with Stanford University) and the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) in Southern California (with USC and UCLA). The Kestrel Institute focused primarily on the provably correct transformation of logical models to efficient code. ISI focused primarily on the front end of the process on defining specifications that could map to logical formalisms but were in formats that were intuitive and familiar to systems analysts. In addition, Raytheon did a project to investigate informal requirements gathering and Honeywell and Harvard University did work on underlying frameworks, integration, and activity coordination. Although not primarily funded by the KBSA program the MIT Programmer's Apprentice project also had many of the same goals and used the same techniques as KBSA. In the later stages of the KBSA program (starting in 1991) researchers developed prototypes that were used on medium to large scale software development problems. Also, in these later stages the emphasis shifted from a pure KBSA approach to more general questions of how to use knowledge-based technology to supplement and augment existing and future computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools. In these later stages there was significant interaction between the KBSA community and the object-oriented and software engineering communities. For example, KBSA concepts and researchers played an important role in the mega-programming and user centered software engineering programs sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In these later stages the program changed its name to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (KBSE). The name change reflected the different research goal, no longer to create a totally new all encompassing tool that would cover the complete software life cycle but to gradually work knowledge-based technology into existing tools. Companies such as Andersen Consulting (one of the largest system integrators and at the time vendor of their own CASE tool) played a major role in the program in these later stages. Key concepts= Transformation rules = The transformation rules that KBSA used were different than traditional rules for expert systems. Transformation rules matched against specification and implementation languages rather than against facts in the world. It was possible to specify transformations using patterns, wildcards, and recursion on both the right and left hand sides of a rule. The left hand expression would specify patterns in the existing knowledge base to search for. The right hand expression could specify a new pattern to transform the left hand side into. For example, transform a set theoretic data type into code using an Ada set library. The initial purpose for transformation rules was to refine a high level logical specification into well designed code for a specific hardware and software platform. This was inspired by early work on theorem proving and automatic programming. However, researchers at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) developed the concept of evolution transformations. Rather than transforming a specification into code an evolution transformation was meant to automate various stereotypical changes at the specification level, for example developing a new superclass by extracting various capabilities from an existing class that can be shared more generally. Evolution transformations were developed at approximately the same time as the emergence of the software patterns community and the two groups shared concepts and technology. Evolution transformations were essentially what is known as refactoring in the object-oriented software patterns community. = Knowledge-based repository = A key concept of KBSA was that all artifacts: requirements, specifications, transformations, designs, code, process models, etc. were represented as objects in a knowledge-based repository. The original KBSA report describes what was called a Wide Spectrum Language. The requirement was for a knowledge representation framework that could support the entire life cycle: requirements, specification, and code as well as the software process itself. The core representation for the knowledge base was meant to utilize the same framework although various layers could be added to support specific presentations and implementations. These early knowledge-base frameworks were developed primarily by ISI and Kestrel building on top of Lisp and Lisp machine environments. The Kestrel environment was eventually turned into a commercial product called Refine which was developed and supported by a spin-off company from Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated. The Refine language and environment also proved to be applicable to the problem of software reverse engineering: taking legacy code that is critical to the business but that lacks proper documentation and using tools to analyze it and transform it to a more maintainable form. With the growing concern of the Y2K problem reverse engineering was a major business concern for many large US corporations and it was a focus area for KBSA research in the 1990s. There was significant interaction between the KBSA communities and the Frame language and object-oriented communities. The early KBSA knowledge- bases were implemented in object-based languages rather than object-oriented. Objects were represented as classes and sub-classes but it was not possible to define methods on the objects. In later versions of KBSA such as the Andersen Consulting Concept Demo the specification language was expanded to support message passing as well. = Intelligent Assistant = KBSA took a different approach than traditional expert systems when it came to how to solve problems and work with users. In the traditional expert system approach the user answers a series of interactive questions and the system provides a solution. The KBSA approach left the user in control. Where as an expert system tried to, to some extent replace and remove the need for the expert the intelligent assistant approach in KBSA sought to re-invent the process with technology. This led to a number of innovations at the user interface level. An example of the collaboration between the object-oriented community and KBSA was the architecture used for KBSA user interfaces. KBSA systems utilized a model- view-controller (MVC) user interface. This was an idea incorporated from Smalltalk environments. The MVC architecture was especially well suited to the KBSA user interface. KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views of the knowledge-base. It might be useful to look at an emerging model from the standpoint of entities and relations, object interactions, class hierarchies, dataflow, and many other possible views. The MVC architecture facilitated this. With the MVC architecture the underlying model was always the knowledge base which was a meta-model description of the specification and implementation languages. When an analyst made some change via a particular diagram (e.g. added a class to the class hierarchy) that change was made at the underlying model level and the various views of the model were all automatically updated. One of the benefits of using a transformation was that many aspects of the specification and implementation could be modified at once. For small scale prototypes the resulting diagrams were simple enough that basic layout algorithms combined with reliance on users to clean up diagrams was sufficient. However, when a transformation can radically redraw models with tens or even hundreds of nodes and links the constant updating of the various views becomes a task in itself. Researchers at Andersen Consulting incorporated work from the University of Illinois on graph theory to automatically update the various views associated with the knowledge base and to generate graphs that have minimal intersection of links and also take into account domain and user specific layout constraints. Another concept used to provide intelligent assistance was automatic text generation. Early research at ISI investigated the feasibility of extracting formal specifications from informal natural language text documents. They determined that the approach was not viable. Natural language is by nature simply too ambiguous to serve as a good format for defining a system. However, natural language generation was seen to be feasible as a way to generate textual descriptions that could be read by managers and non-technical personnel. This was especially appealing to the air force since by law they required all contractors to generate various reports that describe the system from different points of view. Researchers at ISI and later Cogentext and Andersen Consulting demonstrated the viability of the approach by using their own technology to generate the documentation required by their air force contracts.

Abu'l-Qasim himself was born in Hamdanid Aleppo before fleeing with his father to Fatimid Egypt, where he entered the bureaucracy. After his father's execution, he fled to Palestine, where he raised the local Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal to rebellion against the Fatimids (1011‚Äì13). As the rebellion began to falter, he fled to Iraq, where he entered the service of the Buyid emirs of Baghdad. Soon after he moved to the Jazira, where he entered the service of the Uqaylids of Mosul and finally the Marwanids of Mayyafariqin. He was also a poet and author of a number of treatises, including a \\"mirror for princes\\".  Life = Early life and career in the Fatimid court = Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn was the son of Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al- Husayn al-Maghribi, himself the grandson of the family's founder, Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Maghribi, a Persian official who had originally served at the Abbasid court of Baghdad as head of the diwan al-maghrib, the \\"Bureau of the West\\", whence the family's nisbah of \\"al-Maghribi\\". In the late 940s, Abu'l-Qasim's grandfather entered the service of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, serving as a secretary (katib) under Emir Sayf al-Dawla (r. 946‚Äì967), a post to which he was followed by Abu'l-Qasim's father Ali. According to the 13th-century Aleppan historian Ibn al-Adim, Abu'l-Qasim was born in May 981 in Aleppo. The later Egyptian historian al-Maqrizi reports that he was born in Egypt instead, but this is in all likelihood incorrect. In 989/90, Abu'l-Qasim was forced to flee the Hamdanid domains when his father Ali sided with the rebellious governor of Homs, Bakjur, in his effort to capture Aleppo from Sayf al-Dawla's son and heir, Sa'd al-Dawla (r. 967‚Äì991). Ali defected to the rebel camp, but Bakjur's assault failed, and the Banu'l-Maghribi were forced flee to Egypt and the \\"lusher pastures of the Fatimid court\\", in the words of Hugh N. Kennedy. In Egypt, Ali rose to senior posts in the caliphal administration, while Abu'l-Qasim received his education as a katib, and in the early reign of Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r. 996‚Äì1021) acquired an influential position in the Diwan al-Sawad (the fiscal bureau responsible for the land tax). = Flight from Egypt and the Jarrahid revolt = Soon, however, the Banu'l-Maghribi became involved in the intrigues between various factions of the Fatimid court, and in 1009/10, the powerful Christian vizier, Mansur ibn Abdun, convinced al-Hakim to have all the members of the family executed. According to the poet Ibn al-Qarih, who had been tutor to the Banu'l-Maghribi before the massacre, Abu'l-Qasim was largely responsible for this turn of events: in a polemical text (hija) written against him, Ibn al-Qarih accused him of \\"having been the indirect instigator of his family's ruination through his own intrigues\\" (P. Smoor). This provoked the reaction of the famous Syrian poet Abu'l-Ala al-Ma'arri, who had been in contact with Abu'l-Qasim and later wrote an elegy on the latter's death; nevertheless, in the exchange of letters that followed al-Ma'arri himself recognized that Abu'l-Qasim's intrigues played a role, although he tried to minimize this by ascribing them to \\"youthful ambition and inexperience, and their terrible result as being the ultimate effect of crushing Fate\\". Abu'l-Qasim was the only one of his family to escape death, and fled to the Jarrahids of Palestine in 1011. Driven by a flaming desire to avenge himself upon the Caliph, he persuaded the Jarrahid emir, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, to raise the Bedouins in open rebellion against al-Hakim. The revolt spread swiftly through the Palestinian hinterland. Even the provincial capital, Ramlah, fell to the Bedouin, and the coastal cities were besieged, but not taken. Abu'l-Qasim went as far as orchestrating the proclamation of an anti-Caliph, the Alid Sharif of Mecca, Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, in July 1012. Despite the rebellion's initial success, the Jarrahids were susceptible to bribery by the Caliph and did not inspire trust in their confederates: dismayed by the lack of respect shown to him by the Jarrahids, Abu'l-Futuh abandoned the revolt and returned to Mecca, while Abu'l-Qasim himself fled to Iraq. = Later career in Iraq and the Jazira = In Iraq, Abu'l-Qasim tried to seek refuge in the Abbasid administration (then under Buyid control). Ibn al-Adim reports that the Abbasid caliph, al-Qadir (r. 991‚Äì1031) was initially suspicious of Abu'l-Qasim's intentions due to his nisbah, which implied Fatimid sympathies, and Abu'l-Qasim was forced to remain at Wasit until the true origin of his surname could be explained. From the Baghdad court, he switched to the service of the Uqaylid ruler of Mosul, Qirwash ibn al-Mukhallad, as his vizier, before entering the court of Nasr al-Dawla ibn Ahmad, the Marwanid ruler of Mayyafariqin. He then returned briefly to Baghdad to serve as vizier under al- Qadir, but soon fell out with the Caliph due to his support for pro-Alid factions in Kufa, and was forced to return to Nasr al-Dawla's service, where he remained as vizier until his death in 1027. In accordance with his will, he was buried in Karbala.  Writings  Abu'l-Qasim was also an author and poet of some note. His more important works were a compilation of Ibn al-Sikkit, a work on Arab tribal nomenclature, and a short manual on statecraft, or \\"mirror for princes\\", the Kitab fi'l-si'yasa, probably written for his patron, Nasr al-Dawla ibn Ahmad. In his work, al-Ma'ari records al-Maghribi's possession of a precious library. It survived long after his death in Mayyafariqin, where Ibn Shaddad reported it as still extant two centuries later. Legacy Abu'l-Qasim's alleged conversations with the Nestorian archbishop Elijah of Nisibis form the basis of that cleric's Book of Sessions (), covering religious, literary, and linguistic topics..

With his active participation curricula and programs of the faculty were developed, \\"radio engineer\\" qualification for graduates was established. His textbook in two parts, \\"The course of transmitting devices\\" was published in 1957‚Äì1958. This book and his tutorials were fundamental and intelligible at the same time. Under his supervising 6 doctoral (habilitation) and 20 PhD theses were produced. At the department headed by Neiman research in the field of radio transmitters and antenna systems was conducted. He headed the department \\"Microwave Technology\\" of the laboratory at the Radio Faculty. Since 1946, Neiman worked also at the Central Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering (CNIRTI, former Scientific Research Institute-108). Under his leadership a number of research and development works were made: new methods for the generation, transmission and reception of microwave signals, the production of large capacities in the centimeter and decimeter ranges, constructive design of disk klystron and others. Neiman was the member of the CNIRTI Scientific Council. Neiman died on June 25, 1975 in Moscow. On one of the buildings of the Moscow Aviation Institute in his memory a memorial plaque is set. In 1995 the Moscow Aviation Institute held a meeting devoted to the 90th anniversary of the birth of Neiman. Speeches of staff and his pupils revealed great respect for his research and teaching, to his personality. Many people noted that even now Neiman is the example of real scientist, a wonderful teacher and a man of high moral character, and he serves as the guide for their work and life. In 2005 the Aircraft Radio Electronics Faculty at the MAI held a conference of young scientists, PhD students and students dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Neiman. The scientific work and achievements Neiman made the significant contribution to the development of many areas of radioelectronics. In 1920-1930-s under his leadership and with his participation transmitters of different power and range, and also antenna-feeder systems for different ranges for the greatest Soviet shortwave broadcasting centers were developed. He developed methods of regulating the phase velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves along the antenna wire, which have found wide application in the later traveling wave tubes of UHF and microwave bands, as well as a surface wave antennas. He published the monograph \\"The transmitting antennas\\", which for a long time served as a guide for the design of these antennas and was used as the textbook. He created a general theory of frequency stabilization, developed a theory of calculation of passive vibrators. He conducted the study of the phenomenon of flare expiration of the antenna wire, the results of it were used in the design of antennas and super- powerful Soviet shortwave radios. He created the general theory of receive antennas based on an electrodynamic principle of reciprocity, and it became conventional in radio engineering. He carried out a number of theoretical and experimental studies of band antennae (in-phase and rhombic), developed the theory of rhombic antennas, invented two advanced systems of rhombic antennas. Also developed the theory of inhomogeneous lines with impedance that varies exponentially. Proposed and developed a general theory and methods of calculation of closed oscillating electromagnetic devices, later known as the \\"volume resonators\\", which are the basis of many systems of UHF and microwave bands. He developed a new type of antenna - diffraction antenna (one of its species is slot antenna). Also proposed the theory and method of preparation of the traveling wave along the wire without loss of power. He formulated the general requirements and principles of the building of broadband antennas, discovered and described the phenomenon known as \\"feeder echo.\\" Together with A.A. Pistolkors he developed the theory of a direct measurement of the traveling wave in the feeders and created the appropriate measuring devices, so called \\"feeder reflectometers\\". In the late 1940s, Neiman developed the theory of electronic modes of triode and tetrode generators at high angles of electron span and large vibration amplitudes. His monograph \\"Triode and tetrode microwave frequency generators\\" was awarded the Stalin Prize of the 3rd degree in 1951 and published also in German and Chinese. In the 1950s and 1960s, Neiman proposed the new principle for broadband antennas free from the reflection phenomena and called \\"antennas of smooth radiation\\", and also the new method of calculating the power and radiation resistance of metallic antennas based on the calculation of emission of electrons moving in metal. He generalized the theory of contours and lines on the vibrational, channelizing and emitting electromagnetic microwave systems, which became the basis for the design of a wide class of microwave systems (monograph \\"A generalization of the theory of chains on the wave systems\\"). He developed the theory of transverse joints in waveguide systems, proposed a number of methods for design and analysis of triode, tetrode, pentode, klystron, platinotron, magnetron and reznatron amplifiers and oscillators, carried out studies of surface electromagnetic waves. In the book \\"Automatic processes and phenomena\\" he proposed a number of original provisions of the general theory of automatic processes. Also conducted several studies in the field of computer science: explored theoretical issues of radiopulse fast discrete automation systems, stated principal considerations for the automation of research, automation of programming of ultrafast computing systems. In 1964-65, Neiman expressed original ideas and principal considerations of radical miniaturization on elements for recording, storing and retrieving of digital information to the molecular-atomic level, including the use of biological structures of DNA molecules. Much later the actual use of DNA for this purpose started. Full texts of the Neiman's publications on radical miniaturization.https://sites.google.com/site/msneiman1905/ In 1966-67, Neiman generalized negentropy principle of information to digital data processing systems, and defined the relation restrictions between their speed and energy level of the functioning of their elements. He made a number of fundamental assumptions of the theory of extracting information from the objective processes, identified the cause of her contradictions and paradoxes. Also he worked on the history and prospects of development of electronics. Neiman published over 90 scientific papers, including six books and textbook for higher school, which was released in two editions. For fruitful scientific, pedagogical and social activities, Neiman was awarded the Order \\"Badge of Honor\\" (1953) and three medals, in 1962 he was awarded the title \\"Honored Personality of Science and Technics of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\\".

It was the seat of a hofmark, a Bavarian feudal estate. After the old castle was destroyed, the schloss was built in 1682. It was burned down in 1927, but was rebuilt following the original design as closely as possible. Building The schloss stands on an artificial hill. It is reached by a small bridge over the moat, which is now dry. There are fifteen steps leading up to the grand entrance. The richly- ornamented wooden door was made in the early 19th century and survived a fire in 1929. Above it the family emblem of the Barons of Gravenreuth, a unicorn, is at the left and the Bavarian lion is at the right. The building is almost square, with three stories and a tent roof. Grounds The castle lies on the southwestern edge of a large landscaped area with a stream, pond, picturesque bridges and boat house. An Orangery built in 1830 with old Bohemian etched glass panels was used to preserve delicate plants in the winter. There is a grotto among the trees built in the 19th century by the Countess of Boullion, great-grandmother of present Baron, dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes. A small pavilion was brought from the Paris Exhibition of 1900, from where visitors can look over the great lawn. Outbuildings to the south were once used for carpentry, brewery, blacksmith and gardening. They have survived and are being renovated for new uses. The Orangerie was built in 1807 and expanded into its present form in 1871. It was later allowed to deteriorate. One wing collapsed and the roof of the Palm house was in precarious condition. Recently plans were made to renovate the building to contain a swimming pool, changing rooms and sauna, and two guest apartments. History The house was built on the site of a former moated castle, first mentioned in 1408. The two-story castle was built by Wolfgang von Waldeck. A woodcut by Philipp Apian from 1568 gives some idea of the original shape. It had a stepped gable roof and was surrounded by a moat. This early castle was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). In 1682 Johann Baptist Freiherr von Leyden built a schloss on the same site, which is depicted in an engraving by Michael Wening from around 1700. The castle had a chapel and various outbuildings around three sides of a square to the south. Karl Ernst Graf von Gravenreuth came to live in the schloss. He was from a Frankish noble family that had emigrated to France. He was a friend of Napoleon, with whom he had studied at the French Military Academy. He emigrated to Bavaria when the French Revolution broke out. He became a minister of the Bavarian state, and was involved in arranging the secret Treaty of 1805 in which Maximilian I Joseph became king of Bavaria. The Emperor Napoleon (1769‚Äì1821) often visited the schloss. Hortense de Beauharnais (1783‚Äì1837), stepdaughter of Napoleon and queen-consort of Holland, was also a frequent visitor. She is said to have donated the cast iron railings of the entrance bridge. In 1816 the Graf von Gravenreuth used money that Napoleon had given him in compensation for his lost properties in France to purchase the Affing hofmark. The castle had been poorly maintained by the previous owner, who was struggling financially. Gravenreuth renovated the building, expanded the brewery and built a brick factory and a nursery to bring in revenue. His wife redesigned the landscape garden in the informal English style. There were no significant structural changes until 16 October 1927, when the castle was destroyed by a major fire, probably due to a faulty fireplace. Six firemen died fighting the blaze, but their hand pumps could not reach the top floor. Some antique furniture was rescued but many valuable objects were lost. The owner determined to rebuild the house exactly as it looked in 1694. The present castle is thus a reconstruction.

Northumberland County Council Planning application reference C/10/00267/CCMEIA dated 29 November 2010. In May 2012 the UK government Planning Inspector Clive Sproule, held an inquiry into this proposal, after the County Council had rejected applications to develop the site. The inquiry sat for nine days between 15‚Äì31 May. On 7 August the Planning Inspector published his decision. The appeal by HM Project Developments Ltd against the decision of the Northumberland County Council was allowed provided a schedule of conditions could be met.The Planning Inspectorate Appeal Decision Ref APP/P2935/A/11/2164056 A notable person absent from the inquiry was Dr Dick van Steenis, a retired GP, whose presence at other inquiries to give evidence of the link between open cast mining and reduced life expectation and other health problems, had previously led to the blocking of many open-cast mines.Dr van Steenis was too ill to attend the inquiry. He died a few months later (The Times obituary 16 April 2013). Hartleyburn Parish Council then sought a judicial review of the Planning Inspector's decision. Hartleyburn Parish Council's challenge to the Inspector's decision was dismissed by Judge Brehens sitting in the High Court in Leeds.[2013] EWHC 1650 (Admin) Case No: CO/9843/2012 14 June 2013 Following the Planning Inspector's decision, an amended application was submitted by HM Project Developments Ltd to Northumberland County Council.Variation to condition 2 of ref C/10/0022267/CCMEIA Northumberland County Council Planning and Environment Committee This application was recommended for acceptance by the County Council Planning Case Officer and was approved by the Planning and Environment Committee of the County Council on 7 January 2014.

The ''''' ('CNSA, \\"National Relief and Food Committee\\"; ) was a relief organization created in 1914 to distribute humanitarian aid to civilians in German-occupied Belgium during World War I. It was directed by the Belgian financier √âmile Francqui. The CNSA acted as the network by which the aid brought in by the international Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB) could be distributed within Belgium itself. Background Before the outbreak of World War I, Belgium relied on supplies of imports for almost three- quarters of all food consumed. With the German invasion in August 1914, the importation ceased and, as the economic crisis created by the invasion escalated, the distribution of the food that was available began to break down. In particular, the British Royal Navy began a four-year \\"Blockade of Europe\\" which, although aimed at Germany, also cut food supplies from neutral countries to German-occupied Belgium. Foundation and operation of the CNSA The Committee was established in September 1914, shortly after the German army occupied Brussels, under the name Comit√© Central de Secours et d'Alimentation (\\"Central Relief and Food Committee\\"). It was supported by voluntary contributions from a small group of notable financiers and businessmen, including Ernest Solvay, Dannie Heineman and √âmile Francqui. √âmile Francqui, a businessman, who was instrumental to the foundation and operations of the CNSA Initially, the Committee's activity was restricted to the city of Brussels and its suburbs. However, as the Germans extended their control across Belgium following the fall of the city of Antwerp in October 1914, and as the threat of famine within Belgium increased, the Committee linked up with similar organizations around the country and took the title \\"national\\". The initial direction of the Committee was given to Francqui. Francqui's position as head of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (\\"General Company of Belgium\\"), a giant semi-nationalized holdings company, allowed the CNSA access to a nationwide distribution network. From the start, the Committee was organized into two sections: one responsible for providing and selling food and the other for charitable aid such as clothing. Both sections of the CNSA were highly decentralized and relied heavily on local Committees across the country for much of their operations. As an American, and therefore a citizen of a neutral country, Heineman used his contacts abroad to find overseas sources of food which might be shipped to Belgium to resupply the populace. Food from abroad being the only viable immediate solution to Belgium's food shortage, the Committee's chief initial difficulty was obtaining the permission of the British and German governments to import food and in providing guarantees that it would not be used for military purposes. The CNSA was also supported in its early activities by Charles de Broqueville's Belgian government in exile. The logistical problems involved in coordinating the huge shipments of food to Belgium meant that the CNSA began to look for foreign assistance in procuring and transporting material to Belgium. Francqui used his personal acquaintance with Herbert Hoover, future President of the United States, to create an external body to assist the management of the CNSA. Hoover became the director of the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB), and led successful attempts to raise money abroad in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Belgium. Because the CRB was officially an American organization, the CRB was also necessary to assure that the food, once delivered to the CNSA, was not immediately seized by the Germans. The CRB also provided the international support necessary to convince the British government to permit the shipments. Once received, the food and material from the CRB was distributed through the CNSA's network of 125,000 agents across the country. The CNSA continued to expand throughout the occupation. In April 1915, the German Government allowed the CNSA to extend its operations to the occupied regions of northern France, under the auspices of a subcommittee called the Comit√© d'Alimentation du Nord de la France (\\"Food Committee of Northern France\\"). By 1918, the CNSA had distributed 3.4 billion Belgian francs' worth of aid across Belgium. Evaluation Postcard depicting the three patrons of the CNSA who were all ambassadors of neutral countries to Belgium: Brand Whitlock (United States); the Marques of Villalobar (Spain); and Maurits van Vollenhoven (Netherlands). The work of the CNSA during the war was considered extremely successful by contemporaries and modern historians alike. By providing a network of food distribution, the CNSA and CRB managed to avoid a major famine in Belgium during the occupation. Nevertheless, although the CRB and CNSA were part of the same network, the CRB criticized the CNSA, holding it responsible for occasional thefts of food by the Germans and for providing inadequate security for the shipments. The Belgian arm, however, felt under undue pressure from the CRB. In 1916, Francqui even petitioned the British to allow the CNSA to take full charge of the international network away from the CRB, although this appeal was dismissed because of the precarious position CNSA held within the occupied country. Nevertheless, relations between the two bodies remained generally good. The Committee also played an important political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium from being able to use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population of the occupied territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium. The Belgian government in exile supported the CNSA, which they hoped, in the words of the Minister Michel Levie, would become an \\"underground parliament\\" and fulfill the day-to-day running of the Belgian state which the occupation made impossible for the official government to carry out. Historians have also described the organisation of the CNSA, with its central committee and local networks, and its activities such as providing unemployment benefits to Belgian workers in 1917, as echoing those of an official government in peacetime while also serving as a symbol of national unity.

It is subordinate to the Works Branch of the Development Bureau and the current director is Leung Koon-kee. History The origins of the Architectural Services Department lie in the Architectural Office, one of the sub- departments of the former Public Works Department (PWD). The PWD was founded in 1891, but the structure of the department at that time is reportedly unclear. The Architectural Office existed by 1939, and following the disruption in operations during the Japanese occupation, the unit was kept busy in the postwar years by rebuilding work. The 1948 annual report of the Public Works Department reported that 274 government buildings were repaired that year. During the 1960s the Architectural Office was heavily involved in the resettlement housing programmes, but these duties were divested to the Hong Kong Housing Authority upon its 1973 establishment. The modern Architectural Services Department (abbreviated ASD or ArchSD) was founded in 1986, reporting directly to the Secretary of Lands and Works. Some of the most prolific clients of the department have been the Urban Council and Regional Council, and their successors the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. =Significant projects (as architect)= * Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier (1957) * Central Government Offices (1954‚Äì1959) * Queen Elizabeth Hospital (1963) * Murray Building (1969) * Hong Kong Space Museum (1980) * Prince Philip Dental Hospital (1981) * Hong Kong Coliseum (1983) * Supreme Court Building (1984) * Kowloon Central Library (1985) * Wanchai Tower (1985) * Queensway Government Offices (1986) * Hong Kong Railway Museum (1986) * Sha Tin Town Hall complex (1987) * Tuen Mun Town Hall complex (1987) * Hong Kong Cultural Centre (1989) * Immigration Tower (1990) * Revenue Tower (1990) * Hong Kong Museum of Art (1991) * Tai A Chau refugee detention centre (1991) * Regional Council chambers and Regional Services Department headquarters (1991) * Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (1992) * Hong Kong Stadium (1994) with HOK Sport * Kowloon Walled City Park (1995) * Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground (1996) * Hong Kong Institute of Education (1997) with P&T; Architects * Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices (1999) * Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse (1999) * Kwai Tsing Theatre (1999) * Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence (2000) * Hong Kong Central Library (2001) * Stanley Municipal Services Building (2005) * Hong Kong Wetland Park Visitor Centre (2006) * Tuen Mun Hospital Rehabilitation Block (2007) Directors * Jos√© Lei, 1986-1991 * Paul Jeremy Corser, 1991-1993 * Kenneth Chan, September 1993‚ÄìApril 1997 * Pau Shiu-hung (ÈÆëÁ¥πÈõÑ), October 1997‚Äì2 November 2002 * Yue Chi- hang (‰ΩôÁÜæÈèó), 3 November 2002 ‚Äì 4 July 2009È´òÂ±§ÂÆòÂì°‰ªªÂëΩÔºåÊñ∞ËÅûÂÖ¨Â†±Ôºå2002Âπ¥11Êúà2Êó•„ÄÇ * Marigold Lau Lai Siu-wan (ÂäâË≥¥Á≠±Èüû), 5 July 2009 ‚Äì 16 October 2011È´òÂ±§ÂÆòÂì°‰ªªÂëΩÔºåÊñ∞ËÅûÂÖ¨Â†±Ôºå2009Âπ¥6Êúà25Êó•„ÄÇ * Leung Koon-kee (Ê¢ÅÂÜ†Âü∫), 17 October 2011 ‚Äì 9 December 2017È´òÂ±§ÂÆòÂì°‰ªªÂëΩÔºåÊñ∞ËÅûÂÖ¨Â†±Ôºå2011Âπ¥9Êúà27Êó•„ÄÇ * Mrs Sylvia Lam Yu Ka-wai (Êûó‰ΩôÂÆ∂ÊÖß), from December 10, 2017È´òÂ±§ÂÆòÂì°‰ªªÂëΩÔºåÊñ∞ËÅûÂÖ¨Â†±Ôºå2017Âπ¥11Êúà16Êó•„ÄÇ Notes ; References  External links * Architectural Services Department Category:Hong Kong government departments and agencies Category:Hong Kong architecture ","title":"Architectural Services Department"},{"id":"41556278","text":"Architectural office may refer to: * An architectural firm * The predecessor of the Architectural Services Department of the Hong Kong government ","title":"Architectural office"},{"id":"41556282","text":"Enida persica is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.

It was released on 15 February 1999.  Plot  Bernardo Puccini (Ezio Greggio), visits the Italian natural food company, owned by his wealthy but hot-tempered father Guido Puccini (Gianfranco Barra) for a work as a food examiner and flavour developer. He is delighted by the taste of a new cream cheese he had asked, which contains no sugar, fat and preservatives. However, it displeases Guido for the lack of sugar, and angrily argues with his son for additional chemical additives instead of natural substitutes. He then receives a heart attack and is taken to the hospital, along with his old-aged doctor, Dr. Caputo (John Karlsen). In the intensive care unit, Guido recites to Bernardo his history during World War II where the statue of Virgin Mary fell on him and pinned, but was saved by an American soldier named Jake Gordon (Mel Brooks). He tells his son to deliver Jake to him as his last request for a half of his business, and Bernardo unwillingly accepts the request. Sofia (Randi Ingerman), his girlfriend who receives plastic surgery, questions about the request that it doesn't deserve to take the job, but he pursues to fulfill his father's will. When he arrives at Los Angeles, California, he visits the mental hospital where Jake Gordon is located, who was discovered as delusional from a day after the war he had experienced. Nevertheless, Dr. Barbara Collier (Julie Condra) and her father Dr. Hugo (Robert Dawson) refuses him because Jake is unpredictable to be released. After that, he sneaks to make Jake remember that Jake had saved his father, and to break him free. They are able to escape the hospital after they push the mental patients on wheelchairs as a diversion to gate guards, but are discovered by Dr. Barbara and Dr. Hugo, who orders her to retrieve him back. As they arrive in Italy, Jake offers Bernardo a drink that he dissolved five sedative pills. Bernardo unknowingly doses it, causing him to become perplexed in arrival terminal. They are soon found by Dr. Barbara Collier, and Jake steals Bernardo's wallet (which he falsely thinks that Bernardo Puccini photo is him) and quickly escapes to Monte Carlo, Monaco. After he is recovered, Bernardo confronts Dr. Collier that he should bring Jake to his father to fulfil the request, but Collier wants him to return to the mental hospital when Dr. Hugo holds her responsibility for letting the patient go. Bernardo and Collier arrive in Monte Carlo, and enter the hotel where unidentified Jake had checked in. Bernardo replies the lobby his own name that Jake used from his purloined wallet. The lobby tells them that he is out to the beach, and Bernardo finds him covering the topless female sunbathers with hand towels. He removes them, but accidentally includes a sensitive, aged sunbather, who calls the police due to his perversion. After he was released from prison by Collier, Bernardo's twitching sensation is increasing, and he proves to her that having Jake with him turns him insane every time Jake causes trouble. In the diner, Collier advises him to stay calm so he will be fine. When he hears the piano tune and is annoyed by twitches, he rushes for it and finds Jake. When Jake finds Collier, he departs the building, causing Bernardo to chase after him, but causing the police to follow them. Bernardo is feebly pinned down by the statue of Virgin Mary, which Jake reminds him about the incident. They finally sidestepped from police chase, but Jake is handcuffed by Collier who demands to take him with her. Bernardo does not surrender and sets up the trap, installing a fake corridor in the airport, which turns out to be a truck carrying Jake away. But again he was arrested. In the police station, Bernardo madly retells what Jake had been abusing him and what Jake had performed compulsive acts all along. Dr. Collier feels remorse about his sanity, so she allows him and Jake to depart back to Italy. As Bernardo and Jake meet Guido, whose heart condition is recuperating, Guido strangles Jake for revenge because of the death of his wife. Bernardo breaks them apart, and Jake states his reason of vengeance that he had married Jiovana who happens to be Guido's wife, but realized that she is a he. Sofia approaches with her newly surgicated body parts, and tells the police to arrest Jake for his insanity. Dr. Collier intervenes and declares Jake a \\"free man\\", so he is released. Bernardo scolds Sofia for her abnormal femininity and her plastic surgery obsession, and dumps her. He then persuades his father to take over the factory. Guido asks to call over Dr. Caputo, but his son realizes that he is dead. Bernardo later falls in love with Dr. Collier while Jake enjoys his marching dance with other patients. Later, Bernardo becomes Collier's husband and Jake's assistant, but then pretends to dislike the cream cheese the way Guido did. He visits Jake in the office, and grows headache. Jake uses a \\"relocating pain\\" again by hitting Puccini's leg with a golf club. Bernardo runs away while Jake tries to finish the \\"treatment\\".

Eating live animals, or parts of live animals, may be unlawful in certain jurisdictions under animal cruelty laws. Religious prohibitions on the eating of live animals by humans are also present in various world religions. Animals are also eaten alive for shock value. Practice=As a crime= In October 1963, a case was reported in Vit√≥ria de Santo Ant√£o, Pernambuco, Brazil. A man named Ant√¥nio Pinto bought a donkey for three thousand Cruzeiros. He then galloped with the animal and stopped at every bar he sighted to have a drink. Then, he bit on the animal's ear strong enough to swallow it. He said that he had eaten the animal's ear as a \\"snack.\\" Finally, he strangled the donkey with a cord.Comeu as orelhas do jumento para depois enforca-lo: Loucura, Diario de Noticias (November 1963)Comeu as orelhas do jumento e depois enforcou-o com as r√©deas, Diario de Pernambuco (October 29, 1963)Comeu as orelhas do jumento e depois enforcou-o com as r√©deas: Recife, Correio Braziliense (October 31, 1963) In 2006, 49-year-old Reggie Paul Fountain ate his pitbull puppy alive. He bit off the animal's ear and carried it around with him as he ran around his neighbourhood in his underwear, covered in blood, before he was restrained by police. He was arrested, and explained that he was on PCP and cocaine.Man Accused Of Eating His Dog Alive, KSLA (April 13, 2006) =For shock value= Several television game shows such as Fear Factor, Survivor and I'm a Celebrity feature segments where contestants must eat live animals including spiders, cockroaches and grubs. Other shows such as Man vs. Wild also feature Bear Grylls eating various insects alive. There have been calls to ban eating animals alive on these shows. A YouTube channel called \\"Food for Louis\\" shows Louis Cole eating live animals. =Traditional food=Fish In Japan, Ikizukuri (\\"prepared alive\\") is the preparation of sashimi (\\"pierced food\\") made from live seafood. The most popular sea animal used in ikizukuri is fish but octopus is typically the only species that is still moving on the plate. Another fish dish invented by a Taiwanese chef from Chiayi, is called Yin Yang fish (also dead-and-alive fish) in which the fish's body (but not the head) is rapidly deep-fried and served while the head is still fresh and moving. It is prepared extremely quickly, with care not to damage the internal organs, so that the fish can remain alive for thirty minutes. In an interview, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc stated that in Japan, he had eaten live eels. He was advised to add vinegar and sake, which made them jump around, and then swallowed them whole. Frog In 2012, a video showing a woman in Japan eating a live frog was posted on YouTube and went viral. In the video, a live frog is seen stabbed alive, stripped of its skin, and its inedible innards removed to be served as fresh sashimi on an iced platter. In 2007, a newspaper reported that a man from south east China claimed that eating live frogs for a month cured his intestinal problems. He also eats live mice and rats. Andrew Zimmern of the Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods ate frog sashimi in restaurant seafood name Asadachi in Shinjuku. Though most of the frog is served dead (and raw), the meal begins by eating the frog's fresh, still-beating heart. Snake Consuming the beating heart and blood of live snakes has been a reported practice among some locals and tourists in certain parts of Vietnam, particularly Le Mat village in Hanoi. The practice was documented on Gordon's Great Escape when celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay swallowed the beating heart of a cobra at a Ho Chi Minh eatery. It was also consumed by celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain in the same city. Octopus In Korea, Sannakji is the preparation of live octopus that has been cut into small pieces or prepared whole, and served with its arms still squirming. Sea urchin Sea urchins are prized as a delicacy in many places worldwide (particularly in Japan, France, South Korea, Chile, New Zealand, the Philippines, Italy, Spain, the Mediterranean, and North America) for their briny-flavoured gonads. The gonads are often eaten raw, such as in sushi (typically called uni), and some people prefer to eat them immediately after they are cut open. Scissors are often used to avoid the protective spines whilst cutting the animal open. The gonads do not move, even when taken from the live animal. Shrimp In China, drunken shrimp is a dish that can be served live, although it can also be prepared with dead shrimp. When served live, the shrimp, usually 10 per serving, are first doused in a strong liquor which makes them less likely to struggle while being swallowed and also creates a flavourful marinade. A plate is typically held over the bowl to prevent the shrimp from leaping out as they are much more active than when served as Odori ebi. Odori ebi (\\"dancing shrimp\\") is a type of Japanese sashimi that contains young shrimp, usually only one individual per serving. The shrimp has its shell removed and sometimes its head as well. These can be deep fried and served alongside the rest of the shrimp, which is still moving its legs and antennae while being eaten. The shrimp only dies when chewed. Oyster Oysters are the most common animal eaten alive, as it is generally their state when served raw. Ant A chain of restaurants, based primarily in Copenhagen, serves a salad crawling with live ants. The ants are chilled so that they move slower, and are supposed to taste like lemongrass. Cockroach Live cockroaches were eaten in a competition in Florida in 2012. The winner collapsed and died from asphyxia due to choking and aspiration of gastric contents. Larva Casu marzu is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese that contains insect larvae. One example of eating live larvae is the witchetty grub of Australian aboriginal cuisine, which can be eaten alive and raw or cooked. Casu marzu is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese, notable for containing live insect larvae. It is found almost exclusively in Sardinia, Italy. Casu marzu goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage most would consider decomposition, brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly Piophila casei. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese. The cheese received attention on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. Zimmern described the taste of the cheese as \\"so ammoniated\\" that \\"...it scorches your tongue a bit.\\" The cheese is known to leave an aftertaste for a duration of up to several hours. Similar milk cheeses notable for containing living insect larvae are produced in several Italian regions. Religious prohibitions According to the Talmud (a central text of Rabbinic Judaism and the basis for all codes of Jewish law) the sixth law of the Noahide Laws ( Sheva mitzvot B'nei Noach, lit. \\"Seven Laws [of the] Children [of] Noah\\", which are believed to apply to all humanity) sets out the moral imperative not to eat of a live animal (the Tosefta has the graphic language not to eat \\"a limb torn from a living animal\\"). According to Jewish law, this Noahide Law is (along with the other six) considered to be binding on all the \\"children of Noah\\" ‚Äì that is, all of humanity ‚Äì as the minimum set of morality laws to be practiced by all human beings, irrespective of their religion. The laws of Kashrut, on the other hand, set out additional regulations which are binding upon Jews only. Thus, Kosher laws further determine what is and is not fit for consumption by Jews, and under what circumstances even otherwise kosher foods become unfit for consumption for Jews (including how an animal must be killed by Jewish ritual slaughter before it is consumed by Jews). Thus, eating of a live animal is forbidden under Noahide Law and specifically for Jews under Kosher law. Any non-Jew who adheres to the Noahide laws is regarded as a righteous gentile, and is assured of a place in the world to come ( Olam Haba), the final reward of the righteous.Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote See also * Eating live seafood * Odorigui, Japanese term for consumption of live seafood while it is still moving * Pain in animals * Pain in invertebrates * Goldfish Swallowing, a school fad in 1930s American high schools and colleges * Cruelty to animals References Category:Carnivory Category:Dishes involving the consumption of live animals ","title":"Eating live animals"},{"id":"41556347","text":"Dikimdya () is the name of several rural localities in the Sakha Republic, Russia: *Dikimdya, Gorny District, Sakha Republic, a selo in Mytakhsky Rural Okrug of Gorny District *Dikimdya, Nyurbinsky District, Sakha Republic, a selo in Dikimdinsky Rural Okrug of Nyurbinsky District *Dikimdya, Olyokminsky District, Sakha Republic, a selo in Kindigirsky Rural Okrug of Olyokminsky District ","title":"Dikimdya"},{"id":"41556369","text":"The Best Laid Plans is a Canadian comedy-drama miniseries based on the Stephen Leacock Award-winning 2008 novel of the same name by Terry Fallis.Scott Stinson, \\"The CBC‚Äôs Best Laid Plans is a backroom at the top\\".

Headquartered in Nashville, TN, the company operates the largest contiguous rubber plantation in the world in Liberia, which first opened in 1926. History=Creation and early history= During the 1920s, the United States access to rubber was restricted by the European colonial powers (Britain and the Netherlands), which held a monopoly in rubber production.Robert Anthony Waters Jr, Historical Dictionary of United States- Africa Relations, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 103-104 Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, considered rubber a vital resource due to its usage for car tires and began working with American rubber companies in order to find a rubber source that was controlled by US interests. Part of a Department of Commerce-subsidised worldwide search for a place for rubber plantations, rubber magnate Harvey Samuel Firestone sent experts to Liberia in December 1923 to do a soil survey. In 1926, the Liberian government granted Firestone a 99-year lease for a million acres (to be chosen by the company wherever in Liberia) at a price of 6 cents per acre,W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, \\"Liberia, the League and the United States\\", Foreign Affairs, July 1931 Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the non-native South American rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis in the country, eventually creating the world's largest rubber plantation. Firestone also provided a $5 million loan at a 7% interest rate to the government to pay the foreign debts it had and to build a harbour needed by Firestone. The loan was given in exchange for complete authority over the government's revenues until the loan was paid.Rosenau, p. 17 The loan took a larger and larger portion of the Liberian government's incomes: it grew from 20% of the total revenue of Liberia in 1929, to 32% in 1930, to 54.9% in 1931 and nearly the whole revenue in 1932. An estimation made by a member of the American Legation in Liberia said that Liberia really paid a 17% interest rate for the loan. During the Great Depression, as rubber price fell, Firestone stopped its development of the plantation (using just 50,000 acres and cutting wages in half), and, depriving the Liberian government of tax incomes, the government missed a payment to the loans to the company. Firestone asked the US government to send a warship to Monrovia to enforce the debt payment, but President Franklin Delano Roosevelt rejected the \\"gunboat diplomacy\\". The loans to the company were finally paid in 1952.Rosenau, p. 18 =During the civil wars= As rubber demand went down during the 1980s, Firestone dismissed a number of 5000 workers, leading to the local antipathy to the company.Rosenau, p. 20 On June 6, 1990, during the First Liberian Civil War, the resistance group National Patriotic Front of Liberia took over the Firestone plantation and evacuated US personnel. The exact nature of Firestone's activities in the plantation between 1990 and 1997 is unclear, the government's official stance was that they were able to take it back within a few months, while media reports say that it was not operational until late 1994.Rosenau, p. 21 In 1997, after the violence was over, the company restarted the operations, at first at a third of capacity, with 3000 workers. The company soon faced a number of violent protests, as its employees wanted better working conditions, better pay and resettlement benefits. By October 2008, it was operating at half the capacity, withholding further investments until the government finally agreed to give the company a lenient tax status.Rosenau, p. 22 =Current operations= In 2005, the Firestone Company and the Liberian government signed a new 37-year deal raising the lease to 50 cents per acre. Labor controversy The workers accuse the company of serious labor abuses, including exploitative child labor, which they claim amount to modern-day slavery. Workers specifically claim that Firestone's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children, subjecting them to grueling and dangerous work conditions. In response to the claims, the president of Firestone Natural Rubber told a CNN interviewer that \\"each tapper will tap about 650 trees a day, where they spend perhaps a couple of minutes at each tree.\\" As the network pointed out, this would add up to more than 21 hours of work per day. In May 2006, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) released a report detailing the state of human rights on Liberia's rubber plantations. According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. =Alien Tort Claims Act= In November 2005, the International Labor Rights Fund, representing \\"tappers\\" (workers who extract latex from rubber trees) on the Liberian plantation, filed an Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) case in US District Court in California against Bridgestone (parent company owning Firestone), alleging \\"forced labor, the modern equivalent of slavery\\", on the Firestone Plantation in Harbel, Liberia. The lawsuit stated: Firestone rejected these allegations, stating that the corporation has provided employment and pensions to thousands of Liberians as well as healthcare. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children. In reply to the charge of exploitative child labor, Management of the plantation claims that workers are bringing their own children to work to assist them and that this is not endorsed by the plantation management. Workers claim that management's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children as their only means of meeting quotas. Even though Liberia does have child labor laws and Firestone has banned children from tapping trees, workers say the ban is not enforced. The workers say the only way they can complete their daily quota is to bring their children along. Firestone management says if children are found helping their parents, the employees are cancelled, and if necessary, disciplined. \\"We have very strict policies about our child labor. We do not hire anybody under 18 years of age, and we discourage parents from bringing their children to the fields with them.\\" Firestone requested to transfer the case to Indianapolis, Indiana, from California and this request was granted in April 2006. =UN report= In May 2006, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) released a report: \\"Human Rights in Liberia‚Äôs Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future\\". According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also noted that workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated since the houses were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.

Founded by English aristocrats in the late nineteenth century and enjoying royal patronage, the society grew quickly. It aimed to improve understanding and sympathy between rich and poor, and encouraged well-off children to correspond with, and occasionally host, poor children from the East End of London. Foundation and patronage The society was established in 1893 by the Earl of Winchilsea and his wife the Countess, in memory of their only son, George Edward Henry, Viscount Maidstone (\\"Maidy\\"), who had died the previous year at the age of nine. Prior to his death, the child had discussed with his father the idea of establishing the Order.Blunt, Wilfrid. Lady Muriel: Lady Muriel Paget, her Husband, and her Philanthropic Work in Central and Eastern Europe. London, Methuen & Co., 1962, pp. 10-11. The bereaved parents were assisted in the foundation of the society by their daughter Lady Muriel Finch-Hatton (later famed for her many philanthropic works). Among its patrons were Princess Victor of Hohenlohe- Langenburg who was the society's \\"Grand Princess\\"; the members included four Battenberg children of Princess Beatrice (Queen Victoria's youngest child). In 1898, the head office of the society was in London. The Order was still in existence in 1907. Membership Initially the membership was principally drawn from the counties of Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. By 1895 the original membership of a dozen had expanded to over 10,000, with 300 associates over the age of 17 called the Elder Children. Five hundred of these children had established friendships with London children by that year. By the end of the following year the membership numbered 12,000, and reached 13,000 in 1898, the year of Lord Winchilsea's death. Aims and objectives The society's motto, quoting Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, 4.13.87, was \\"What's brave, what's noble, let's do it\\". This motto appeared on the logo together with a woodcut likeness of Maidy in an Eton collar.Blunt, Wilfrid. Lady Muriel: Lady Muriel Paget, her Husband, and her Philanthropic Work in Central and Eastern Europe. London, Methuen & Co., 1962, p. 12. Its rules were \\"Gentleness, Honour and Love\\"; and its stated object was \\"to bind together, with the threefold cord of gentleness, honour and love, children belonging to every sphere of life, so that by kind words and deeds passing betwixt one and the other, more especially from the rich to the poor, a spirit of sympathy and large-heartedness may be encouraged in early life.\\" With a view to personal connections being established, the wealthy children would send the London child \\"clothes, boots and some of their pocket money, and [issue] invitations to holiday in the family home outside of London\\": this would encourage \\"social and moral responsibility amongst the children of the wealthy classes\\". Activities An American account of 1895 describes its activities thus: > The rich boy or girl becomes the fairy godmother or Santa Claus of a poor > child: he sends the little waif his old clothes, he personally packs up the > pair of boots that will keep the little feet from the London stones. He > saves a trifle out of his pocket money to give that child some little > present, or a treat. He gets his mother to invite the London waif down into > the country for a fortnight or maybe a month. The street arab is thus not > boarded out with dozens of other children, but comes alone as the guest of > the rich boy. The waif is located in the lodge or the gardener's cottage, > and during his stay the rich child devotes so much time every day to play > with the town streetling, and in this way the rich and the poor children get > to understand one another. The activities included a rural meet in the south-east organised for a thousand East End children, a London tea with music and a cinematograph exhibition for 1500 poor children, a Christmas party at St Mark's Hall in the East End for three hundred children (which featured a fifteen-foot tree), and large picnics including competitive sports held for the members and their London counterparts, the first of which was held in the grounds of the Earl's semi-ruined ancestral home, Kirby Hall, Northamptonshire. At this picnic, attended by 300-400 children, 'a grand investiture' of the Order was led by Lady Winchilsea. The railway companies assisted the work of the Order by carrying the London children at greatly reduced fares. Shortly after the society was established, the Earl and Countess of Winchilsea founded a temporary convalescent home for poor 'companions' of the Order in the village of Ewerby, close to the family's Lincolnshire estate. The Order was featured each month in the 'Companions' section of Lord Winchilsea's weekly agricultural paper The Cable, and membership forms were printed in the paper: membership entitled children to take part in competitions and to write for advice and help on any subject.

Life Born at Lincoln on 3 November 1792, he was the third son of a coal-dealer. His parents were Wesleyan Methodists in Lincoln. He received his early education from local teachers, mainly from the Rev. W. Gray, a senior vicar of the cathedral: he knew the classics, and studied French, mathematics, and Hebrew. Hannah helped his father in his trade, and at an early age became a Wesleyan preacher in villages around Lincoln, preaching his first sermon at Waddington.

In 1824 Hannah was sent to America to a Wesleyan conference. He was in 1834 appointed tutor of the Wesleyan Theological Institution, at Hoxton and then at Stoke Newington. From 1840 to 1842 and from 1854 to 1858 he was secretary, and in 1842 and again in 1851 president of the Wesleyan conference.

His work has been exhibited in many museums and galleries in Greece and abroad and he has also worked on various book illustrations. Life Tassos Mantzavinos was born in Athens on 2 March 1958. His first painting instructors were Manos Sofianos and Mimis Kontos. He studied painting at the Athens School of Fine Arts in 1979 and graduated with distinction in 1984. Among his teachers was Yiannis Moralis. In 1984 he held his first solo exhibition in Athens at Gallery 7. Tassos Mantzavinos continued with numerous solo exhibitions in Greece and participated in group exhibitions in Greece and abroad. He also participated in the 2nd and 3rd Biennale of Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean in Thessaloniki and Barcelona, as well as the 16th Biennale of Alexandria in 1987. Along with his artistic career, Tassos Mantzavinos taught drawing at the Vakalo Art & Design College in Athens and worked on various book illustrations. Work Since his early period, the key elements of his painting were the anti-naturalistic, expressionistic intensity in the drawing style of his forms and an existential exploration through particular themes, but also through the act of painting itself. After the mid 1990s, the largest part of his work features narrative elements, referring to personal memories, experiences and dreams, clearly autobiographical, or strongly symbolic folk tales and traditions. Tassos Mantzavinos‚Äô themes sometimes acquire a surrealistic dimension, as they are presented in unexpected combinations. The frequent presence of the artist's figure in the paintings, and his fascination with certain thematic motifs reveal a deep, empathetic link between the artist and his work. His three-dimensional wooden constructions, one of his latest artistic endeavours, function as an extension of his painting, enhancing its communicative immediacy.

The building was later converted into a shopping centre and demolished in 2013. History=Background= The building's history can be traced back to a pavilion built by Kongens Klub (\\"King's Club\\") some 200 metre further to the west in 1846. It was dismantled when the Zealand Railway Company constructed Copenhagen's new central station, in 1864, and rebuilt on the corner of Vester Farimagsvej (now Axeltorv) and Vesterbro Passage (now Vesterbrogade). In 1872, a new owner changed its name to Caf√© Boulevard . =Etablissementet National= The opening night, illustration from Illustreret Tidende Interior In 1880, Hans Hansen, a well-known developer of the time, acquired the property. He commissioned Henrik Vilhelm Brinkopff to expand the complex and changed its name to Etablissementet National. At its opening on 15 January 1882, it was the first building in Copenhagen to feature electric light. It contained 73 electric lamps and had a spotlight on the top of one of the corner towers casting light onto the pavement below. The old part of the building was replaced by a new, circular concert hall, again with Brinkopff as the architect, which was inaugurated on 13 October 1893. In 1884, Hans Hansen went bankrupt and National Scala was taken over by a newly founded company. In the 1890s, the repertoire consisted mainly of theatre. The restaurant was called Euterpe. =La Scala and Scala-teatret= Thor Jensen, an entrepreneur who had returned from the US, then took over the building, introduced a cabarets and changed the name to La Scala in 1898. The orchestra was led by Georg Lundbye, H. C. Lundbye's son. One of the main attractions were the singer Dagmar Hansen while the American illusionist and escape artist Harry Houdini were among the guest performers. Scala-teatret in 1922 Between 1912 and 1927, with Frede Skaarup as owner and theatre director, Scala experienced a renaissance under the name Scala-teatret. The repertoire was operettas and revues, featuring popular artists such as Liva Weel and Carl Alstrup. =National-Scala= The run-down Scala-teater closed in 1930. The building then went through a comprehensive renovation under supervision of the engineer Christen Ostenfeld, his first major assignment, and the name was changed to National-Scala. It went through another modernization in 1937 before finally closing in 1957 with debts of $150,000 and the loss of 275 jobs. Its last big hit was a three-week stint by Josephine Baker in 1955. =Anva and Scala= The Scala building The building was acquired by FDB, demolished and replaced by the Anva department store. In the 1980s, the building was acquired by a consortium of investors, including Bent Fabricius-Bjerre. It reopened as a shopping mall after a major renovation in 1989, containing five cinemas, 12 restaurants, fitness centre as well as stores. It was never a success and changed hands several times up through the 1990s. In 2007, a new owner, Centerplan, decided to demolish the building, launching an architectural competition for the site, prior to the company's bankruptcy in 2008. In 2011, Ejendomsselskabet Norden together with ATP, PFA and Industriens Pension acquired the building. New plans for the site were released in 2011 and the building was finally demolished in 2012. The construction site of the Scala Project The Scala Project The new project for the site consists of five cylinders of varying height and interconnected by skyways, positioned on a one-storey plinth. The project also proposes a renovation of the square that will enhance Fortification Ring's character of being a \\"green belt\\"surrounding the city centre.

The cousins Erskine Felix, Kendel Felix, Kendall Felix, and Irvine Henry were arrested and eventually convicted of the crime. Erskine worked for Stark, a prominent member of the Satmar Hasidic community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of New York City. Claiming that Stark owed him money, Erskine recruited his cousins to help in a botched robbery of Stark that instead turned into a homicide. The New York Post featured a front page image of Stark with the headline, \\"Who Didn't Want Him Dead?\\". The headline, referring to the notion that Stark had acquired a number of enemies during the course of his real estate dealings, sparked condemnation from local officials for showing insensitivity towards the victim, and for seeming to condone crime.  Background  Menachem Stark was a prominent member of the Satmar Hasidic community of Williamsburg, a neighborhood of New York City. He was a real estate developer. = Loan defaults and missing money = Public records showed that Stark and his business partner, Israel Perlmutter, had some business troubles dating back to the 2007‚Äì2009 recession, including a $29 million loan default resulting in a 2009 bankruptcy and a lawsuit in 2011,Rumors Fly Among Hasidim About Abducted Man‚Äôs Death, New York Times, January 6, 2014 and an unrelated $2.9 million loan default that led to a $4 million judgement in 2012.IN RE SOUTH SIDE HOUSE, LLC, accessed via Leagle.com, January 15, 2014 The media also reported on a long list of building violations in properties owned by Stark and his partners.A Developer Is Mourned and Vilified in Brooklyn.

Newsday, January 23, 2014 said that Stark had \\"obtained cashier's checks made out to a multitude of individuals, entities and law firms to pay for personal debts or for use in other real estate transactions.\\" According to the Daily News, the checks were marked \\"customer withdrawal\\". The Daily News said that court records show that, in the month before Stark was murdered, five \\"customer withdrawals\\" were taken out from the account, totaling $267,101. According to court records, a rent security account at one of Southside LLC's businesses contained only $3,500, when it should have in excess of $200,000 on deposit. The account contained rents collected from the company's buildings, which the company continued to manage as its bankruptcy was being processed. Flaxer said he would call Stark's widow and his partner Perlmutter to testify in the case. Perlmutter, via his attorney, said he would use his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination if he is questioned about the missing money. Perlmutter also reportedly told police that the pair owed about $1 million to a loan shark or a Russian businessman. In the weeks before his death, Stark reportedly ended his conversations with the phrase \\"Please pray for me\\". He would ask the person to whom he was speaking to invoke his name and his mother's name, a sign in Orthodox Judaism of someone facing a life-threatening situation.Arrest looms in abduct-slay of Brooklyn landlord.

He was also badly burned on his torso and hands. When found, he had $4,000 cash in his pocket, and uncashed checks in his name worth another $41,000.Probed in Killing. New York City Authorities Investigate Business Dealings of Well-Known Real-Estate Developer Menachem Stark Wall Street Journal Online, January 6, 2014  Arrests  Four cousins were arrested in the aftermath of the crime. Erskine Felix, the ringleader, lived in nearby Crown Heights and managed construction sites owned by Stark. He had about $20,000 worth of construction work which had not been paid up to that point. His co-conspirators ‚Äì his brother Kendall Felix, cousin Kendel Felix, and cousin Irvine Henry ‚Äì worked as carpenters on those construction sites. According to prosecutors, Erskine, claiming Stark owed him the money, plotted to kidnap him and hold him for ransom. In May 2014, Kendel Felix, 29, was indicted on charges of second-degree murder, kidnapping, and attempted robbery in the case. He said that he and two accomplices had kidnapped Stark, hoping to get the money. According to the New York Post, Kendel confessed to the killing and admitted to being the driver of the van, as well as one of the men who wrestled with Stark on the sidewalk. The Post said that Felix implicated two other men in the murder, but that they had been arrested and then released. According to Felix's alleged confession, one of the accomplices said \\"He owes me money\\" just before they grabbed Stark. Felix indicated that the death was unintentional, and occurred after one of Felix's accomplices sat on Stark inside the minivan.  Convictions  Kendall Felix, who admitted to burning Stark's body, was charged with conspiracy and hindering prosecution. He pleaded guilty in 2019 to both counts in exchange for a plea bargain offered by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun. In March 2019, he was sentenced to 2 1/3‚Äì7 years behind bars, over prosecutors‚Äô objections. Felix, who was confronted by Stark's widow, declined to address Chun or Stark's family during his sentencing. In April 2019, Erskine Felix was convicted of second-degree murder, first degree kidnapping and tampering with physical evidence for masterminding and carrying out the fatal kidnapping. He was acquitted of another first-degree kidnapping charge and a conspiracy charge. Jurors took fewer than five hours of deliberation to convict Felix. In June he was sentenced to 24 years to life. In May 2019, Kendel Felix was sentenced to 15-years-to-life in prison. He apologized to the victim's family.  Outrage about New York Post front page  The New York Post featured an image of the deceased Stark on the front page of their January 5 edition with the headline, \\"Who Didn't Want Him Dead?\\". The front page sparked outrage, specifically among members of the Orthodox Jewish Community, amid suggestions that the Post was helping to create a climate of violence. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind, and other local politicians condemned the coverage at a press conference at Brooklyn Borough Hall, and there were calls for a boycott of the tabloid. The Post refused to apologize, saying that the headline referred only to Stark's \\"many enemies\\", and expressed its sympathies to the deceased man's family.Post's report on slain slumlord draws harsh criticism, NY Post, January 5, 2014Chicago Jewish News: \\"A man of dishonor\\" July 20, 2014 Stark left behind a wife and seven children.

He was Director of the University of Cambridge Computing Service from 1970‚Äì1994, Chief Executive of United Kingdom Joint Academic Network (JANET) 1994‚Äì1997, and Executive Director of Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) 1997‚Äì2002. He is now much involved with the National Museum of Computing. He was involved in the development of the programming language CPL, whose influence can be traced on to C, and C++. He was president of the British Computer Society from 1999 to 2000 and chairman of the Computer Conservation Society from 2007 to 2011. Student years Dr. Hartley became an undergraduate at Clare College, University of Cambridge in 1956. He read Mathematics for the first two years and studied Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing in his third year, graduating BA in 1959. He then became a research student of Computer science developing the first programming language \\"Autocode\\", and its compiler for the EDSAC 2 computer, for which he was awarded a PhD in 1963. His thesis was entitled \\"Automatic Programming for Digital Computers\\". Software development As a member of the staff of the university's Mathematical Laboratory he was joint author, with David Barron, John Buxton, Eric Nixon, and Christopher Strachey, of the early high-level programming language CPL. which was subsequently developed into BCPL which in turn influenced B and C. From 1962 to 1967 he was a major contributor to the development of the Cambridge Multiple Access System that was developed for the Titan, the prototype Atlas 2 computer built by Ferranti for the university. This was the first time-sharing system developed outside the United States, and it influenced the later development of UNIX. Hartley was successively Junior Research Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, Fellow of Darwin College and then University Lecturer. He also did some pioneering work in video-tape recorded lecturers. In 1986 he was elected a Fellow of Clare College where he is currently secretary of the Alumni Association. Computing service Between 1970 and 1994 Dr. Hartley was director of University of Cambridge Computing Service. The service had been founded as the Mathematical Laboratory under the leadership of John Lennard-Jones in 1937, although it did not become properly established until after World War II when Maurice Wilkes became Director. Upon its foundation, it was intended \\"to provide a computing service for general use, and to be a centre for the development of computational techniques in the University\\" and Wilkes continued this strong service ethos. He learnt about electronic computation, reading John von Neumann's First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC and attending the final two weeks of the Moore School Lectures. EDSAC was the result, and Wilkes also supervised Hartley's PhD. When Dr. Hartley became Director, the Mathematical Laboratory was renamed the Computer Laboratory, with separate departments for Teaching and Research, and the Computing Service. One of Dr. Hartley' most notable achievements as Director between 1987 and 1992, was to conceive and design the Granta Backbone Network, a fibre-optic network that joined up all of Cambridge's university and college sites.The Granta Backbone Network should not be confused with the \\"Cambridge Ring\\" which was an experimental local area network architecture developed at the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory in the mid-late 1970s and early 1980s. Public service From 1972 to 1974 Dr Hartley was chairman of the UK Inter-University Committee on Computing. He was a member of the Computer Board for Universities and Research Councils ‚Äì which allocated government funds to purchase the large and expensive computers that the institutions needed ‚Äì from 1979 to 1983 where he had special responsibility for network development. From 1981 to 1986 he was a member of the Prime Minister's Information Technology Advisory Panel. Having become a Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS) in 1968, Dr. Hartley served on its Council in 1970‚Äì73, 1977‚Äì1980 and 1988 to 1990, was a Vice-President from 1987 to 1990, Deputy President in 1998‚Äì99 and President in 1999‚Äì2000. Since ceasing to be Director of the University Computing Service, Dr. Hartley has served both private sector and public sector bodies, but the latter have predominated. From 1994 to 1997 he was Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association (UKERNA) whose objectives were to take responsibility for the UK academic community's networking programme, and to further opportunities with other communities, including industry. It developed JANET, the UK's joint academic network, which provides computer network and related collaborative services to UK education and research, including further- and higher-education organisations and the UK Research Councils. From 1997 to 2002 Dr. Hartley was Executive Director of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre which maintains the largest searchable database of experimentally-determined small molecule crystal structures. It performs analyses on these data and facilitates others' use. Dr Hartley maintains strong ties with the University of Cambridge where he continues to be a Fellow of Clare College and an Honorary Member of the Computer Laboratory. He has recently become involved in the history of computing, serving for four years as Chairman of the Computer Conservation Society, a special-interest group of the British Computer Society. In 2012 he spent a year as part-time Museum Director of The National Museum of Computing and is currently a trustee of the EDSAC Replica Project.

Plot Tommy McCabe (Dennis Morgan) is a cocky nightclub singer who gets his jollies out of making fun of the local police force. In fact, his act includes a parody of a policeman. This does not prove amusing to pretty Jerry Sullivan (Gloria Dickson), the daughter of a police lieutenant (Harry Shannon), nor to Jerry's flatfoot boyfriend Bill Morrissey (John Payne). Tommy falls in love with Jerry, but initially receives a cool reception from her father and brothers, who are also police officers. Tommy's singing in the Sullivan parlor melts the hearts of everyone but Morissey. Due to his love for Jerry, Tommy joins the police force. Jealous, Morrissey subjects him to a rigorous training program beyond what is typical for cadets. Eventually suspended from the police because of his carelessness, Tommy ends up saving the day by saving Morrisey's life. Tommy is finally reinstated in the force, thus rewarding Jerry's faith in him.

It can be made of wood, stone or metal. Most wayside crosses are designed as crucifixes. Stone crosses may also be conciliation crosses. Often they serve as waymarks for walkers and pilgrims or designate dangerous places.Sakrale Kleinbauten: Flurkreuze / Wegkreuze(PDF; 256KB) Redaktion: ibid Altbau AG, CH-Merkbl√§tter des Bundesamtes f√ºr Bev√∂lkerungsschutz, Kulturg√ºterschutz They are particularly common in Europe, for example in Germany, Galicia, Ireland and the Alps.  Description  Wayside crosses are especially common in Roman Catholic regions. Most of them were erected in previous centuries by the local population as a sign of their faith. Several of them were put up at places where an accident or a crime took place. The custom of placing an \\"accident cross\\" at spots on the roadside where people have been killed has, meanwhile, spread worldwide. Special forms of cross are the conciliation cross and the \\"plague cross\\". Many wayside crosses, however, simply act as waymarks to indicate difficult or dangerous spots or to mark intersections. On walking maps, wayside crosses and shrines are displayed in order to aid orientation. On many crosses there is an inscription which may indicate why the cross was erected and by whom. In some regions wayside crosses are mostly made of wood (e. g. in the Alps). They vary in size from small, inconspicuous crosses to great crosses hewn from stout beams. On many crosses, a skillfully carved figure of Jesus Christ is displayed. In many cases, when a wooden cross became rotten or dilapidated over the decades, it was restored or replaced with a new one on the same spot. In many regions of Europe, wayside crosses are made of stone, and consequently last much longer. That said, many such stone crosses in the Rhineland region of Germany were lost during French occupation (1794‚Äì1814), because wayside crosses were banned in the wake of the strict secularisation that was imposed. Only a few crosses were able to be hidden by the local population and thus avoid destruction. Originally these stone crosses were short and stocky in shape and, with a height of about half a metre, considerably smaller than their wooden counterparts. In the 19th century (at least in the Rhineland) much larger stone crosses were put up. By the North Loop of the N√ºrburgring racing circuit in Germany there was a centuries-old stone cross called the Schwedenkreuz (\\"Swedish Cross\\"). In 1594 the fortress city of Raab (present day Gy≈ër in Hungary) was recaptured from Ottoman Empire by Baron Adolf von Schwarzenberg. In commemoration, the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II decreed that crucifixes be set up on all the main roads and crossing points of the empire, bearing the inscription: \\"Praise and thanks to the Lord God\\". Some of those that survive in Austria and Germany are known as Raaberkreuze (\\"Raab cross\\") or T√ºrkenkreuz (\\"Turk's cross\\"). In M√ºnsterland in north Germany, crosses called Hofkreuze (\\"farmyard crosses\\") may be found. They belong to farms and usually stand by a public right of way near the farm entrance. Votive crosses are erected by people in gratitude for being rescued from death, such as war, sickness, infection or other life- threatening danger. Other so-called \\"weather crosses\\" or \\"hail crosses\\" were set up to ward off natural disasters or extreme weather.

Chapter 10 - Clothing and Textiles, pp. 259-299 Ben Gold was the president of the Fur Workers Industrial Union. Organizational history The Fur Workers Industrial Union was formed in 1927 by a group of New York City locals expelled from the American Federation of Labor-affiliated International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada. The split had been preceded by a power struggle inside the fur workers union locals of New York. Under the leadership of Gold, communists had taken over the control of a number of fur workers locals in New York. They had nearly been able to seize control over the union as such during the 1925 convention. Following a 1926 strike led by Gold, locals in Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark and Boston also swayed to the communist side. In January 1927, foreseeing a communist victory at the 1927 union convention, the communist leaders and locals were expelled on the instructions of the AFL president William Green. The relations between the Fur Workers Industrial Union and the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada were very bad. Violent clashes often broke out between the two unions at picket lines, at workplaces or in the streets of the city. Apart from its presence in New York, the union also established a stronghold in Chicago. In 1935 the Fur Workers Industrial Union merged back into the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada. The merger was preceded by a meeting in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at which the left and right wings of the fur workers movement reconciled and opted for a united front. A mass meeting of 5,000 members of the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada was held in New York in June 1935, defying the AFL president Green by voting to continue merger efforts with the dissident union. According to media reports, Gold received a 15-minute standing ovation when entering the meeting hall.The Miami News, June 22, 1935.

He was the founder and first director of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage. The Institute organizes an international symposium in honour of Coremans on 15‚Äì17 June 2015. Early career Coremans studied Latin and Greek at Koninklijk Atheneum Antwerp from 1920 to 1926. After completing a doctorate in analytical chemistry at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) in 1932, he stayed on as a library assistant. In 1934, Jean Capart, curator of the Royal Museums of Art and History of Brussels, invited him to assemble a laboratory and to reorganize the RMAH's system for photographic artifacts. In his new position, Coremans used laboratory techniques to authenticate artifacts and evaluate their condition. Analysis through radiography, thermography, and ultraviolet light enabled Capart to study objects quickly; he published his results in the Bulletin des mus√©es (Journal of the Royal Museums of Art and History). In 1935, Coremans published his initial researches into the air conditioning of museums. All the while, Coremans took pertinent courses: metallography at ULB; spectroscopy at the University of Li√®ge; history of Flemish painting in the fifteenth century at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. World War II During World War II, Capart asked Coremans to oversee a cultural heritage documentation project. Coremans invited volunteers to photograph monuments and public art around Belgium, to complete the collection of 30 000 negatives belonging to the photographic service of the Royal Museums of Art and History (among which 12 000 realized by the Germans during the First World War). He was supported in this task by Jozef Muls, director of the Administration of Fine Arts, and Constant Leurs, director of the ¬´ Commissariat g√©n√©ral √† la Restauration du Pays ¬ª. Coremans recruited young people, preventing them from being sent to Germany for compulsory labour. He obtained photographers' collaboration in all the provinces of the kingdom. 160 000 views were taken. It was the basis of the ¬´ Archives centrales iconographiques d'Art national ¬ª. Armed Resistance fighter, Coremans hid young resistance fighters and objectors to forced labour in Germany, in the buildings of the Jubilee park (Parc du Cinquantenaire). His team fulfilled emergency missions to save fragments of the Saint Gertrude of Nivelles shrine, and mural paintings in the churches of Saint-Brice and Saint- Quentin in Tournai. He also focused on the preservation of artworks in the Bruges museums, moved them to the castle of Lavaux-Sainte-Anne, as well as those stored in various shelters in Ghent, Antwerp and Brussels. He made every effort to prevent their condition from deteriorating. In 1942, he was assigned to the direction of the laboratories of the Royal Museums of Art and History . After the war Coremans helped officials return artworks stolen from Belgian citizens by the Nazis. This confidential mission raised questions concerning the protection of heritage in wartime: Coremans undertook an international survey on the subject. This led to drafting a series of directives published in 1946 in the handbook La protection scientifique des ≈ìuvres d'art en temps de guerre; l'exp√©rience europ√©enne pendant les ann√©es 1939 √† 1945. Meanwhile, museum services of which Coremans was in charge grew bigger, resulting in 1948 in the creation of the ¬´ Archives Centrales iconographiques d'Art national et Laboratoire central des mus√©es de Belgique (ACL) ¬ª, an autonomous institution of which Coremans became the first director. ACL would be renamed in 1957 ¬´ Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage ¬ª. In the same year, Coremans was appointed as an expert in the trial of the forger Han van Meegeren, which earned him great fame afterwards, but also numerous attacks emanating from collectors who had been duped. In 1948, he was appointed lecturer at the University of Ghent where he introduced, for the first time in Belgium, the teaching of technology and scientific examination of works of art, for archeology and art history students, with the aim to include physical characteristics of artwork alongside aesthetic and historical considerations. This experience of the meeting between hard and social sciences led him to reorganize the ACL into three departments: Documentation, Conservation-Restoration and Laboratories: the concept of interdisciplinarity was born. The first major restoration project of the ACL, in 1950, was the restoration of the Ghent Altarpiece by the brothers Hubert and Jan Van Eyck. Other restorations would follow in the same spirit of collaboration. The need to disseminate the methods implemented in these restorations led to publication of the Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Cultural heritage from 1958. At the same time, under the leadership of Coremans, the National Research Centre ¬´ Flemish Primitives ¬ª, was set up, in collaboration with Herman Bouchery and Jacques Lavalleye . The Centre went on to publish several series of books, enabling the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage to increase its international activity. Because of his experience in the field of research centres, Coremans is appointed in 1957 a member of the Special Review Board of Scientific Research, established by the National Council for Science Policy. Between 1951 and 1954, he participated actively in the creation of the Brussels Art Seminar, a university programme established by the Belgian American Educational Foundation, where he proposed courses in techniques used in painting. Eminent specialists, such as Erwin Panofsky, took part. This intense activity, on a national and international level, called for the Royal Institute of Cultural Heritage to move into new premises, independent and custom-built. Coremans studied in detail the requirements of each of the departments of the Institute with Ren√© Sneyers, assistant director, and Maurice Vanden Stock, administrative director. Begun in 1959, the new building was completed in 1962, and was seen as a model of its kind to inspire other foreign institutions. For Coremans, it was mainly the opportunity to rationalize and to develop the training activities of the Institute, by creating a regular programme of post-graduate courses in scientific examination and the preservation of cultural property. Coremans devoted his last years with intense energy to this educational activity. The concept and the dissemination of interdisciplinary teaching in this field was one of its primary concerns. During 1963 he gave courses in both theoretical and practical conservation at the Royal Institute of Cultural Heritage, in collaboration with the Belgian American Educational Foundation and the Conservation Center of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. He died on 11 June 1965 in Noorden. His laboratories manager, Ren√© Sneyers, became the second director of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage. Paul Coremans is internationally recognized as a promoter of interest in the world's artistic heritage, an interest he helped to develop by the implementation of his innovative concepts.

The present building dates to 1646, and was restored in 1900. Building The castle is a 17th-century building on a medieval foundation. It stands on a spur of high land to the west of the village of Sandersdorf. The building has four wings. The east and south wings are decorated with bay windows and gables. The lower west wing contains the inner courtyard with open arcades. There are onion domes over the gatehouse and the castle chapel. The most valuable works of art are a crucifix by Ignaz G√ºnther and the Romanesque tympanum on the outside. History A castle was built as the seat of the lords of Sandersdorf in the mid 12th century. The castle changed ownership several times in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1420 it was burned by Duke Henry XVI of Bavaria-Landshut during his war with Duke Ludwig the Bearded of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. In 1425 Sandersdorf and its estate was awarded to the Muggenthal family. They held the castle for more than 200 years. The castle brewery was founded in 1550, and its Sandersdorf beer became widely known. The castle was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), but the Muggenthals rebuilt it in its present form. In 1646, soon after the reconstruction, Wolfgang Unverzagt Freiher von Roy purchased the property. He went bankrupt, and Johannes Jakob Lossius bought it in 1650. In 1675 it was inherited by his nephew Dominikus de Bassus, a professor at the University of Ingolstadt. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) the building was devastated in 1703. Thomas Maria Baron de Bassus became a leader of the Illuminati in Italy, an secret society founded to promote enlightenment ideas such as opposition to superstition, prejudice, and abuse of state power. In 1787 the Bavarian police raided Sandersdorf castle and found compromising documents. His estate was temporarily confiscated. Baron de Bassus died in Sandersdorf in 1815. Sandersdorf remained the property of the Barons de Bassus, and was partially restored in 1900 by the Munich architect Gabriel von Seidl. In 2008 the Wittelsbach Compensation Fund bought the castle and estate from the de Bassus family.

From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non- integrated nature of rugby within South Africa drew frequent controversy. South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era. Halt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981. South Africa were excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed MƒÅori to go under the status of 'honorary whites'. No other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with rugby league over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world. The issue affected not only black South Africans, but also indigenous New Zealanders and to a lesser extent indigenous Australians. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as would be frowned upon. The famous Scottish rugby commentator, Bill McLaren, devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, Talking of Rugby, called \\"Barred from the International Feast\\". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's \\"unacceptable racist policy\\", but adds \\"it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.\\"McLaren, p145 Ian Robertson, documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity: Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981. Governing bodies Like most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines: * The South African Rugby Board (SARB) for whites,Hopkins, p20 * The South African Rugby Federation (SARF) for \\"coloureds\\" i.e. people considered to be of mixed race. * The South African Rugby Association (SARA) (originally the South African African Rugby Board) for blacks. There was also the South African Rugby Union (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership. However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team. At the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped. British and Irish Lions The British and Irish Lions were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand. In the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in 1955, seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in 1962, 1968, 1974 and one final one in 1980. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their 1997 tour when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed. The Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the South African Rugby Board announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's apartheid policies including a potential boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by Clive Rowlands and coached by Mick Doyle. The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions. MƒÅori and apartheid New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against MƒÅori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that MƒÅori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being MƒÅori, this was agreed to, and MƒÅori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some MƒÅori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at MƒÅori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which MƒÅori were central, and MƒÅori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by PƒÅkehƒÅ (white New Zealanders). In 1973 a proposed Springbok (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed- race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although PƒÅkehƒÅ continued to dominate the movement, MƒÅori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the patu squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement. During and after the Tour, many MƒÅori protesters questioned PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly PƒÅkehƒÅ prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi. 1950s South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games. In April 2010 it was revealed by Muru Walters that in 1956 Ernest Corbett, Minister of MƒÅori Affairs, had told the MƒÅori All Blacks to deliberately lose to the Springboks \\"for the future of rugby\\". The MƒÅori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated MƒÅori rugby players. 1960s Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, Verwoerd barred a MƒÅori rugby player from touring South Africa with the All Blacks, and the tour was cancelled. New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again. In 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations. In 1963, Lloyd McDermott, the first Australian aborigine on the team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to rugby league as a result. B. J. Vorster took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, \\"Dolly\\" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70. Ian Robertson describes the scene at Murrayfield in Edinburgh in 1969: > There was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind > both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with > standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.Rugby a way of life, > p112 1970s Statue of Danie Craven in Stellenbosch. Chris Laidlaw, former All Black, politician and fierce critic of apartheid. In March 1973, the Argentine government and the Union Argentina de Rugby had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to San Isidro Club to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to South Africa by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991. South Africa was the indirect cause of the 1976 Olympic boycott. A New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa prompted African countries to demand that the New Zealand Olympic team be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that rugby union was not an Olympic sport and the New Zealand Rugby Union was not affiliated to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.Espy 181, pp.157‚Äì8 Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana. In February, 1977, Danie Craven flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. > For the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long > last look everybody in the face.

However, some, such as Chris Laidlaw, later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport: > Times have changed, however.

Bill McLaren thought apartheid was \\"unacceptable\\", but: 1980s Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. In 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the Falklands War. The supposedly turned down its invitation to the 1987 Rugby World Cup, because of its distaste for the apartheid regime of South Africa. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the Great Soviet Encyclopedia states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa.Sorokin, px Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited.Thau, Soviet Rugby, p 47 In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that: > No nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose apartheid > in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and > arenas.Cambridge, p494 The Soviets leaned on other nations heavily: > Over the years, Ferasse has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with > South Africa.

To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to Racine and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.Cotton, p29 In 1989 a World XV, sanctioned by the IRB and funded by South African Breweries, played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg . = South Africa in New Zealand, 1981 = Police officers guarding a barbed wire perimeter around Eden Park near Kingsland railway station in New Zealand. The 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.Griffiths, p260-1 Two games had to be cancelled. The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there. The final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the \\"Crazy Biggles Test\\". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets. All-Black prop Gary Knight was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb. Musician Bruce Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour. He was at the University of Otago at the time. It was a tight game, with Allan Hewson, the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25‚Äì22. As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene: > There will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension > generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the > efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an > exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon. The role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour. The NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. Two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour. = New Zealand Cavaliers = A \\"rebel tour\\" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.The 1981 Springbok rugby tour ‚Äì A country divided. New Zealand History Online. This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended. The All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the apartheid r√©gime (1990‚Äì1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers but often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern. Of the 30 players who had been selected for the All Black tour, only David Kirk and John Kirwan did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments--a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport On their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the \\"Baby Blacks\\". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back. = South American Jaguars = The Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Spain. While many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by Union Argentina de Rugby, a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones, due to the politics of those countries. This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the Pumas to play a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa.Union Argentina dr Rugby Memorias 1971 pag.9 Post-apartheid era=1995 Rugby World Cup= After his election in 1994, Nelson Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Prior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions Australia, who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months. During the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France. They then met New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final at Ellis Park Stadium. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a drop goal from Joel Stransky. During the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the Webb Ellis Cup while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as F.W. de Klerk later put it, \\"Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\\"; ; ; ; Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, Winnie, accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.; . These events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-apartheid South Africa.

Secretary of the Air Force =Malmstrom Air Force Base controversy= Three weeks after assuming her duties as Secretary, the news came that there were morale problems in the ranks of the AFGSC. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations was looking into alleged use of synthetic drugs by the airmen and uncovered during the probe facts of cheating on monthly proficiency exams at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.Adam Lowther. A year later: Responding to problems in the ICBM force, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 12 February 2015. Altogether, 92 officers were identified as involved in cheating scandal.Air Force: 92 implicated in nuke cheating scandal, Washington Times, January 30, 2014.

US Air Force suspend 34 airman manning critical nuclear missile launch sites after discovering they cheated on proficiency tests by text, Independent, 16 January 2014. Over the next year, James visited the three Air Force bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, to work with both airmen and senior Air Force officers to provide fixes to the challenges faced. James has cited USAF's inattention to the nuclear mission, to the point of using a simple test score as, \\"a top differentiator, if not the sole differentiator on who gets promoted,\\" as one of the reason of morale's deterioration in the ICBM force.Robert Siegel. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James discusses the Air Force's response to widespread cheating by nuclear missile operators on their monthly proficiency tests, NPR, March 31, 2014. She helped to establish the Force Improvement Program (FIP), a grass- roots-type feedback program designed to quickly locate actionable recommendations for positive change through one-on-one interviews and surveys, identified more than 300 recommendations for improvement.Air Force secretary: Morale, empowerment programs working, The Associated Press (Air Force Times reprint), February 22, 2015. Some of the immediate improvements included funds to upgrade launch control centers, the underground bunkers where airmen and support staff serve 36-hour shifts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; more helicopter support to transport airmen to LCCs; additional manpower to help alleviate the strain on the force, as well as extra pay to attract and keep people in key missile related career fields.

Addressing the 2011‚Äì2013 Malmstrom Air Force Base debacle two years later at Aspen Security Forum, James said that, \\"We never found evidence of cheating beyond that one base, but we did find evidence of systemic problems across the board,\\" which were addressed by increasing training, incentives and creating development opportunities.Amaani Lyle. Air Force Secretary Addresses Priorities at Aspen Security Forum, DoD News, July 25, 2015. =Reducing the size of the Air Force= With a congressional mandate to reduce the size of the Air Force, James decided to make cuts to meet the mandated end strength quickly in one-two fiscal years versus over five years, in order to alleviate some uncertainty for Airmen.Stephen Losey. AF secretary: 18,700 more airmen cuts before it's over, Air Force Times, May 29, 2014. James addressed concerns that the downsizing was straining the force during her travels. She confirmed that the Air Force was able to achieve force size and shape goals in fiscal year 2014 alleviating the need to conduct involuntary force management programs in fiscal year 2015. This was announced during her online town hall meeting when she told airmen that she heard their concerns with regards to involuntary force management boards.Stephen Losey. 'Enough is enough': No involuntary force cuts in 2015, Air Force Times, December 16, 2014. The Air Force began 2014 fiscal year with 330,700 active- duty airmen, and by November 6, 2014 its end strength had dropped to 316,500 becoming the smallest it has ever been since its establishment in 1947. =RPA manning issue= James acknowledged that the Air Force is a force under strain and one of the most impacted forces specifically are those that support remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) operations. RPA operations have surged nine times over the last eight years. With increased operations tempo, expiring active duty service commitments and reductions to the force, the current environment has resulted in projections reflecting more RPA pilots departing the service than the Air Force is able to produce as replacements via the training pipeline. Balancing Air Force ISR capability with finite resources remained a top priority for James so she worked to get monthly incentive pay beginning in January 2015, which was previously not permitted for RPA pilots, to be authorized.Air Force senior leadership addresses need to stabilize RPA enterprise , Air Force Public Affairs, January 15, 2015. James signed a memo increasing the monthly flight pay for 18X RPA pilots from a maximum of $650 to $1,500 per month if they stay in the RPA community beyond their six-year commitment after completion of undergraduate RPA training.Jeff Schogol.

It was named after the Struma (Strymonas) river. Background In August 1916 Romania chose to join the war effort on the side of the Allies. The Allies planned a large offensive in the Macedonian front for the middle of August in order to support Romania's entry in the war and pin down as many Bulgarian forces as possible. The Bulgarian high command suspected an impending offensive and the fighting around Doiran that erupted on 9 August only confirmed these suspicions. On their part the Bulgarians had urged for an offensive in Macedonia since the beginning of the year and now planned a strike with the First Army and Second Army on both Allied flanks. On the western flank, the Chegan Offensive resulted in the conquest of Florina, but the First Army failed to take Chegan (today Agios Athanasios). The plan on the eastern flank was to seize the Drama-Komotini railway and this objective was given to the Bulgarian Second Army and the 10th Aegean Division. For the operation general Todorov could rely on 58 battalions, 116 machine guns, 57 artillery batteries and 5 cavalry squadrons in his army and an additional 25 battalions, 24 machine guns, 31 batteries and 5 squadrons in the 10th Division.  Occupation and consequences  The Struma Offensive began on 18 August with the 7th Rila, 11th Macedonian Division and the 3/2 Infantry Brigade and 10th Division advancing on a 230 kilometer long front. For six days the Bulgarian forces achieved all their objectives in the face of weak Greek and French resistance: following the ouster of pro-Entente Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, the royal Greek government in Athens had demobilized it forces, and pursued a course of neutrality at all costs, even ordering the local Greek troops to not resist the Bulgarian invasion. The depth of the advance reached 80-90 kilometers and an area of 4,000 square kilometers was occupied. Most importantly however the Macedonian Front was shortened with 100 - 120 kilometers. In addition, the demobilized Greek IV Army Corps, under Col. Ioannis Hatzopoulos, numbering 464 officers and 6373 soldiers, that was positioned in the area but wasn't allowed by the Greek government to resist, was disbanded and its troops and armament were interned by the Germans in G√∂rlitz for the rest of the war. General Nikolaos Christodoulou did not obey to the government and together with his men joined the Movement of National Defence, that broke out in Thessaloniki. The cities of Kavala, Drama and Serres were taken. Aftermath The refusal by the Greek government to defend this territory, won after hard fighting in the Second Balkan War of 1913, led to a coup by pro-Venizelist officers and the formation of the so-called \\"Provisional Government of National Defence\\". Greece joined the war in 1917 and eventually recovered all of the occupied territories in 1918, at the war's end.

History=Middle Age and early modern period= In a written source from 1393, students of St. George's Premonstratensian monastery are mentioned for the first time. In a slightly more recent source, this monastic school is also called St. J√ºrgen's School. It educated sons of the clergy and over time also admitted sons of the townsfolk of Stade during the Middle Ages, who were to receive an advanced education. Many university students from that time also came from Stade. Due to the Reformation, the convent of St. George was dissolved and by about 1540, the convent school became a municipal latin school. In 1588, the four-grade latin school converted to a seven-grade gymnasium, which was called the \\"Athenaeum\\" for the first time in 1635. Its first principal was Reiner Lange, who later became Mayor of Stade. Besides Latin, Greek, Hebrew, philosophy and theology were taught. Students from all over Northern Germany came to the Athenaeum. It was able to compete with schools from Bremen and Hamburg. In the early 17th century, the school experienced a period of prosperity, with about 300 students and a new building. The three-winged front part (Altbau) around the forecourt towards the Harsefelder Stra√üe In the 1670s, the Athenaeum lost its reputation, which continued in the 18th century due to the regression of importance of Stade. In 1765, the school building burned down and was rebuilt in 1768. Despite its reorientation to more science education, the numbers of students decreased. The situation did not improve until the mid-19th century. =Imperial period and World War I= Sealing stamp of the school In 1830, the Athenaeum introduced the opportunity to take a maturity exam, which allowed them to study at universities. About five to eight students per year were successful taking the exam, who mainly came from Stade and its vicinity. In the imperial period of Germany, the school was converted to a Royal gymnasium. The number of students increased to 242, which caused a huge lack of space, so the Athenaeum moved to the \\"Carl-Diercke-house\\". After World War I the school lost its royal attribute, however, the school life did not really change. In 1929, the Athenaeum moved again, now into today's building on Harsefelder Stra√üe. Thenceforth the school got the official name \\"Athenaeum\\". =World War II and modern times= During the time of the National Socialism, the gymnasium changed to an \\"Oberschule\\". Like many other German schools, it accepted the national socialist orientation, but headmaster Dr. , who remained in office from 1929 to 1950, cared for continuity despite political upheaval. In 1974, the Athenaeum introduced the coeducation. From 1981 to 2012, the building in the Harsefelder Stra√üe has been expanded several times by new school buildings, a sports field and two sports halls. In 2013, the Athenaeum celebrated its 425-year anniversary with numerous events such as theme days, lectures by former students, art exhibitions and concerts. The Mittelbau of 1958 with photovoltaic system The observatory on the Mittelbau The extension part (Erweiterungsbau) of 2012 Main entrance in the Neubau part of 1982 The Athenaeum today The school grounds in the Harsefelder Stra√üe contain besides the 1901 built main building (called Altbau) a school garden and a sports field. In 1958, a first extension (now called Mittelbau) has been officially opened, 1982 a second one (Neubau). In 1960/1962, two new sports halls with a swimming pool were built, in 2003 they were partly replaced by one big sports hall. In 2012, the construction of another new extension building (Erweiterungsbau) was completed. The current principal is Martin Niestroj. The school's observatory built in 1966 by Dr. Karl Otto Palmer is used by the astronomy working group under the direction of Dr. Hans-Otto Carmesin. Other successful working groups are the chess working group, which is regularly participating in chess tournaments. More well-known working groups are the rowing working group, the theater working group and the school's own choir. In 2001, the teacher Christian Schlecht (French, Ethics) was awarded in a TV show as the \\"Cleverest Teacher Germany\\". In July 2005 an 11th grade of the Athenaeum organized a 24-hour fundraising marathon. The raised money was donated to build a school in Mali. It was the intention of the organizers to open the students for new topics and to get the local businesses into the Athenaeum. In total, 12,000 ‚Ç¨ have been collected, and the school in Mali is built. By another fundraising in December 2005, 2,500 ‚Ç¨ have been collected for an infirmary in Mali. In Summer 2009, photovoltaic systems were installed on the school's roofs, like on other schools near Stade. This project was financed by the federal government, like many other projects, too. Thus, in 2009‚Äì2010 the IT equipment of the school was brought up-to-date. Furthermore, parts of the extension buildings has been renovated and the pavilions were replaced by another building. In November 2010, the teacher Dr. Hans-Otto Carmesin won the Klaus-von-Klitzing-award as the \\"Best Science Teacher of the Year\\", founded by the University of Oldenburg. Dr. Carmesin invested the prize money in the school's observatory. Since September 2012, the new extension building of the Athenaeum is in use. In 2013, another building destroyed by a water damage has been completely renovated, so the rooms of the Realschule Camper H√∂he are no longer needed. In November 2013, Dennis Roeder, English and history teacher at the Athenaeum, was awarded with the \\"German Teacher Prize 2013\\" for his extraordinary educational involvement.

In the history of the Mauricie, the center was an important gathering place for events secular or religious. Under the leadership of Bishop Albert Tessier, from the mid-1950s, Tavibois is recognized as a meeting place for intellectuals and artists. This center is very popular as a summer camp for youth education. thumb  Geography  View of the exterior of the Tavibois chapel, in H√©rouxville, in 2014.

Tavibois center is close to the municipal boundary between Grandes-Piles and H√©rouxville. Despite its proximity to the Saint-Maurice River, 3.8 km (measured in a straight line), the Tavibois center is part of the watershed of the Batiscanie, Quebec. The area surrounding the Tavibois center with several wet areas is the head of the Little Mekinac South River, which flows in Saint-Tite in the Little M√©kinac North River. It empties into the Rivi√®re des Envies, upstream of the city of Saint-Tite. View in 2014 of the main buildings at Domaine Tavibois, H√©rouxville, from the Lac Tavibois dam. The Tavibois domain has three small lakes near the center: Tavibois, Leo and Tessier. Each lake has a retention dam. Upstream in the territory of Grandes-Piles, found the ‚Äúlac √† la truite‚Äù (lake of the trout) and lake Gagnon. These lakes drain into the Little River Mekinac South, whose path to the east (or to Saint-Tite), is more or less parallel to the path of ‚ÄúPetites forges‚Äù (Little forges road).

At the end of the 19th century, John McDougall acquired this area which also included the Forges Saint- Joseph where it was mined iron ore. Finally, the Forges activities were dropped. Subsequently a sawmill there was exploited. Monument to the pioneers installed on the Tavibois estate in H√©rouxville. In 1951, the area of Tavibois was acquired by three co- owner, Albert Tessier, Dr. Avila Denoncourt and Father Boivin. This land included 300 acres, including Farm Rocheleau also called ‚ÄúPetites forges‚Äù (Little Forges). Since the establishment of the Tavibois center, Archbishop Tessier and Dr. Denoncourt have greeted the end of the stay in the community of the Daughters of Jesus, through physical maintenance, website development and animation. The community center was then adopted before inheriting this domain that Daughters of Jesus always administer. This private estate is owned by the Community of the Daughters of Jesus since 1966. Although the area is part of the heritage of the community, the facilities are open to the public such as a place of meditation, contemplation or rest. Families can rent cabins at low prices; each visitor brings his bedding and food. Tavibois hosted renowned artists including Jordi Bonet, the French poet Gustave Thibon, Pierre Bourgault, Leo Arbour, L√©vis Martin, and many others.

Plot Carmelita Carrito (Cooper), a young Mexican girl, is an aristocrat at heart despite the coarseness exhibited by her father Carpi (Marcus). Although she has a lover named Pepo (Blue), Carmelita finds herself attracted to the bandit Leopoldo Juares (Bosworth) when he takes refuge in her house. After his departure, Carmelita watches wistfully after him, eventually falling asleep by the window. A U. S. Army officer, William Jerome (Oakman), comes searching for Juares, and Carmelita, fascinated by the gringo, tells him that Juares is to meet her at the brook. Discovering her duplicity, Juares forces Carmelita to don his hat and coat. Jerome, mistaking Carmelita for the bandit, shoots the girl and is ordered to be executed before a firing squad. Carmelita then awakens from her dream and discovers that United States troops, led by Pepo, are converging upon her house to arrest Juares, who is hiding there. Pepo captures the bandit and wins a large reward as well as Carmelita's affections.

Background Torpy enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1994 and left the service in 2005 at the rank of Captain. He earned his commission through the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he served with the Army's 1st Armored Division in Germany, Kuwait, and Iraq. Critics consider Torpy and his advocacy group to be outsiders, frequently describing Torpy as a \\"perpetually offended\\" atheist, and framing his advocacy for under-represented non- religious groups as an attack on the free exercise of religion. Torpy cites his experiences in the Army and at West Point, when superiors \\"responded with indifference or hostility\\" to individuals or groups who did not profess religious beliefs. Torpy argues that while the numbers of Christian evangelical service members and of non-religious members are about the same (roughly 20% of the military population) there is a clear preference for funding and providing services for the former while attempts to provide the same services for the latter are refused. Activities Through his own organization and partnered with others, Torpy has seen some progress toward his stated goals of gaining acceptance and support for non-religious service members and veterans. The Army invited him to address its 12th-annual Diversity Leadership Conference at West Point in 2012, and the U.S. Army approved a major's request to list humanism as his religious preference for the first time in April 2014.

It is an active Roman Catholic parish church in the diocese of Shrewsbury, and its parish is combined with that of St Joseph, Wallasey. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In 1860 the Seacombe Mission was founded by St Alban's Church, Liscard, and the Roman Catholics of Seacombe first worshipped in the upper room of a house. In 1862 a combined school and chapel were built. The local population was growing, and in 1870 a plot of land was bought, and a presbytery and school were erected. No church was built at this time, part of the school being used as a chapel. In 1883, following a legacy left by a local resident, it was agreed that some of the money should be used to finance the building of a church. Edmund Kirby was chosen as the architect, the foundation stone was laid in 1888, and the church opened in July 1889. The church was damaged slightly by bombs in the Second World War, following which it was renovated. It was reordered following the Second Vatican Council, and there was a more substantial reordering in 2006. Architecture=Exterior= The church is built in stone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under lean-to roofs, a south chapel, and a chancel with a canted apse. The west front has an arched doorway with a sexfoil in the tympanum. This is flanked by gabled buttresses. Above the doorway are five lancet windows. At the top of the west front is a gable containing a large rose window. At the west end of the aisles are paired windows with a quinfoil above. Along the south side of the aisle and on both sides of the clerestory are lancets. On the north side of the church are two gabled transeptal bays with rose windows forming confessionals. There is also a gabled porch and a baptistry. At the east end of the chancel is a three-light window, and on the sides are lancets. The east window contains Geometrical tracery. =Interior= Inside the church the nave and chancel are in one vessel with a single waggon roof. The five-bay arcades are carried on round piers. The octagonal pulpit is in stone with clustered shafts in marble. The high altar and the reredos date from about 1900 and are panelled with coloured marble. Flanking the chancel arch are canopied statues of Our Lady and Saint Joseph. The stained glass in the east window is in memory of those who fell in the First World War.

Parts of it fall within the communities of Rhigos, Aberdare and Treherbert. A recreational walking route, the Coed Morgannwg Way, and route 47 of the National Cycle Network run northeast and southwest of it respectively.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheet 166 Rhondda & Merthyr Tydfil/Merthyr Tudful The reservoir gained national attention in 1969 when significant damage was discovered that led to the evacuation of hundreds of nearby homes and prompted more than ¬£1 million of emergency repair works. Geography and construction The reservoir was built in 1898 and covers an area of . It was located at the top of the Rhondda Fach, near the village of Maerdy. The site holds around of water. The dam was built using earth embankments, the core of which were constructed of clay. The banks were reinforced during the early 1970s with thick concrete. History Construction of the reservoir was completed in 1898. In its formative years, there were several incidents of the reservoir suffering damage. Two minor leaks in the embankments were fixed during the first decade. A larger leak was filled in with around 40 wheelbarrows of rubble in December 1910 and required refilling a year later. Settling issues caused further issues in the 1910s and rerouting work was undertaken when it was discovered that the top of the core in the embankments was only above the water level. In April 1917, a local official recommended that the reservoir be drained or the water level significantly lowered to avoid any risk of destabilising the dam. Work was carried out to address the issues and, by September of the same year, the reservoir was cleared of any further concerns. On 11 November 1929, the area set a new maximum daily rainfall record for Wales when of rain fell, a record it retained as of 2016. As such, the site had been dubbed \\"the wettest place in Wales\\". =1969 flood warning= In December 1969 there was a significant emergency when a local man discovered a large hole, measuring deep and long, after he and his horse fell into the crevice. The man alerted the emergency services who were able to free his horse and alerted the water department who sent experts to inspect the dam. The officials discovered a large crack in a pipe used to drain water from the drawoff shaft, which led to the evacuation of 350 houses, 7 schools and the relocation of miners from Maerdy Colliery. 150 elderly residents were evacuated to higher ground and around 2,000 people also fled the valley. As the reservoir did not feature any system to drain water which are utilised in more modern structures, in order to relieve the pressure on the damaged area, a combined effort from the army, Royal Air Force (RAF), local volunteers and the fire brigade was required to divert water away from the reservoir with the assistance of an RAF helicopter. An estimated 200‚Äì300 workers were utilised in the efforts. To undertake repair work, the reservoir was drained by as much as , leaving it at less than a third of its usual capacity. The workers were hampered in their efforts by the poor access to the site that delayed the arrival of heavy water pumping equipment. The work cost an estimated ¬£1.5 million. More than 450 tons of cement and 80 tons of bentonite were injected into the cores of the embankment during the repair work. The dam was given the all clear by the end of January 1970, although further work was carried out in the following months. As part of the dam's new safety certificate, water was limited to 30 ft below the top watermark, the same level that the dam had been lowered to in order to avoid bursting. =Aftermath= As part of an investigation into the incident, substantial work was carried out on the reservoir to ensure it met the current safety standards. This included reinforcing the embankments with a 600 mm concrete barrier and the installation of new drain-off pipework (nearly double the size of the original). The incident played a part in the introduction of the 1975 Reservoirs Act that required supervising engineers to monitor large, raised reservoirs. The Secretary of State for Wales, George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy, ordered an inspection of all reservoirs in Wales over a certain age as a result, also declaring that \\"lives have been saved\\" by the emergency work carried out. Two minor leaks were discovered at the end of the 20th century, although these were deemed to be of little threat to the structural integrity of the dam.

Two participated in the World Gliding Championships of 1965. Design and development The Standard Class (single seat, span) KAI-14 was an all-metal aircraft designed and built at the Kazan Aviation Institute by a team led by M.P. Simonov in the USSR in the early 1960s. It was a shoulder wing, cantilever monoplane. The leading edge had a forward sweep of 2¬∞ and its trailing edge was compound tapered. The wing terminated with small streamlined bodies known as salmons and was rigged with 4¬∞ of dihedral. Its inset hinged ailerons were each divided into two sections and small area airbrakes were mounted inboard. A braking parachute was deployed when landing. The metal semi-monocoque fuselage had a forward section which contained the cockpit ahead of the wing leading edge but became markedly slimmer aft, in pod and boom style. The KAI-14 had a 90¬∞ butterfly tail with straight tapered surfaces, squared tips and externally mass-balanced elevators. It landed on a fixed monowheel, faired into the fuselage underside, which had a brake operated via the airbrake lever. The rear fuselage was protected by a tail bumper. The KAI-14's cockpit could be configured in two ways, either with the pilot reclining under a long, fuselage contour following, one piece canopy or sitting upright under a shorter, raised canopy. The first arrangement gave lower drag, the second better vision; the latter is sometimes referred to as the \\"trainer canopy\\". Operational history The first flight was made about 1962. It was first seen in the West when two examples were entered as Standard Class competitors at the World Gliding Championships of 1965, held at South Cerney in England. Both were damaged in landing accidents and failed to fly the complete programme.

In retirement Gordon Stott published three volumes of extracts from the diaries he had been keeping throughout his legal career. Personal life Gordon Stott was born in 1909, youngest son of Rev Dr George Stott, minister of Cramond Kirk, Edinburgh, and Flora Stott. He attended the village school, and went on to Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, where he graduated with first-class honours in Classics and won the Vans Dunlop Scholarship in law. He was a pacifist, and during World War II he was a conscientious objector, working on the land as alternative to military service. On behalf of other conscientious objectors, he acted as pro bono counsel at tribunals for conscientious objectors. From 1939 to 1944 he edited a Labour journal, the Edinburgh Clarion. He unsuccessfully stood for parliament as Labour candidate for Central Aberdeenshire in 1935, Edinburgh West in 1945 and Edinburgh North in 1959. He was a founder member of the Muir Society of Labour Lawyers and secretary of the Edinburgh and District Trades Council. In 1947 he married Nancy Braggins and they had two children, Elizabeth and Richard. His hobbies were walking, fishing, reading and golf. Stott was friendly and compassionate, with a plain-spoken and independent manner that showed little tolerance for hypocrisy. Of the government of which he had been a member he wrote \\"On Vietnam the Government gave the appearance of being committed to support the United States whose bombing aeroplanes continued for no intelligible purpose to lavish on that unfortunate country an increasingly powerful but futile demonstration of the American way of death\\". In his retirement Stott published three volumes of his diaries filled with amusing and indiscreet anecdotes: Lord Advocate's Diary (1991), Judge's Diary (1995) and QC's Diary (1998). Legal career In 1936 Stott was admitted as an advocate to the Faculty of Advocates where his outspoken socialist politics were unpopular. After the war he was an Advocate-Depute (prosecuting counsel); he often acted in industrial accident cases. From 1949 to 1956 Stott was a member of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission. He took silk, KC, in 1950, becoming Queen's Counsel in 1952. His pleading was a model of forceful economy and he was a formidable opponent having the adverse judgements of Lord Clyde (Lord President of the Court of Session) regularly overturned when Stott appealed them to the House of Lords. Stott later said \\"... the First Division of the Court of Session fell on evil days and there were some atrocious decisions. We had to go frequently to London to get them put right\\". Stott was Sheriff Principal for the sheriffdom of Roxburgh, Berwick and Selkirk between 1961 and 1964. At the start of the Wilson Labour government of 1964 Stott was appointed as Privy Councillor and Lord Advocate, the senior law officer in Scotland As Lord Advocate - he became known as Lord StottStott did not receive a peerage - his title reflected his position as Lord Advocate and, later, as Senator of the College of Justice - he enjoyed total independence from the government as a public prosecutor and legal adviser. He was responsible for implementing several reforms in the law and for establishing the Scottish Law Commission. Aware that his position was politically vulnerable, when a senior judicial vacancy became available in 1967, and following tradition, he appointed himself to the bench later saying \\"I appointed myself, and a jolly good judge I turned out to be\\". So he became a Senator of the College of Justice (High Court judge in Scotland) in the First Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session appeal court. Dealing with custody cases he would often chat informally with the children involved. A boy had said he would prefer to stay with his father. Stott wrote \\"When I asked him why, he said 'It's the mince. It's not watery'.\\". He retired at the statutory age of 75 in 1984.

They were established by Arthur J. Morris (1881‚Äì1973), a lawyer in Norfolk, Virginia, who noticed the difficulty his working clients had in getting loans. The first was started in 1910 in Norfolk, and the second in Atlanta in 1911. The plans established installment credit for customers. Lending required the borrower to provide references and proof of earnings to establish the borrower's credit worthiness. The banks gave depositors interest to secure funds for the loans. The banks were eventually organized as a New York-based banking organization (holding company) and made small loans to moderate income families through banks in more than 100 U.S. cities. In 1917 credit life insurance plans were offered. Morris Banks made 1,760,000 loans in its first 12 years, amounting to about $320 million. The banks were affected by the Great Depression and changes to the banking industry in its aftermath.  Origins of the concept  In 1910, attorney Arthur J. Morris (1881‚Äì1973) opened the Fidelity Savings and Trust Company in Norfolk, Virginia, which made small loans to working people under a concept he called \\"Morris Plan.\\" Under this lending approach, would-be borrowers had to submit references from two people of like character and earnings power who would guarantee the borrower's creditworthiness, and agreed to repay the loan through the purchase of Installment Thrift Certificates in weekly installments that would repay the face value of the loan. Morris Plan Banks expanded to more than 100 locations in the United States. Morris Plans pioneered the use of automotive financing (through arrangements between the Morris Plan Company of America, essentially a holding company for Morris Plan banks, and the Studebaker Corporation). The associated Morris Plan Insurance Society similarly pioneered credit life insurance (as it allowed for the loan to be repaid if the borrower died during the term of the loan, with any residue going to the estate). Officials H. Ross Ake was secretary- treasurer and manager of the Canton, Ohio, Morris Plan Bank from its founding in 1916. He also was on the Board of Governors of the National Association of Morris Plan Bankers (Industrial loan company#Origins of the concept). In 1929, Walter W. Head took over as president of State Bank of Chicago and guided it through a merger with Foreman National. When Foreman National was acquired by First National Bank in 1931, Head resigned to become president of Morris Plan Corp. At the time, Morris Plan was the largest industrial banking system in the U.S., with $200 million in annual business and 800,000 customers. Locations and bank building architecture * The Industrial Morris Plan Bank of Detroit opened in 1917, while its final location at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Grand River Avenue was completed and opened in 1926.

It originated in 1980 after the split of the Spanish Royal Society of Physics and Chemistry which itself was founded in 1903. The purpose of the RSEQ is \\"to facilitate the advancement and improvement of scientific activity, teaching, research and professional in the field of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.\\" The RSEQ is a member of EuCheMS (European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences), a non-profit organization founded in 1970 that promotes cooperation between scientific societies and European techniques in the field of chemistry. European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences.  History  Although the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry (RSEQ) emerged in 1980, its history dates back to 1903, the year of the founding of the Spanish Society of Physics and Chemistry (SEFQ) and soon began publishing the journal Annals of the Spanish Society Physics and Chemistry. The number of members was 263 in the first year, professionals experimental sciences, primarily engaged in the field of chemistry. In the 1920s, after major development and internationalization, the company incorporated at the IUPAC. In 1928, to mark the 25th anniversary of its founding, the company was honored by King Alfonso XIII with the name Royal Spanish Society of Physics and Chemistry. From this date forward, it created local branches (Sevilla, Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia) and hold biennial meetings of the Society. In 1934, the Royal Society organized the IX International Congress of Chemistry in Madrid, attended by 1,500 chemists in all countries. At that time, the Society already had about 1400 members. After the interruption of the Spanish Civil War and its disastrous consequences, the society began to reach new heights, especially from the 60s onward, as a result of the developing policies of the time. In the 70 territorial sections are consolidated specialized groups, such as Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (created in 1967), and Adsorption (created in 1978). At the end of the decade it was decided to divide the society into two independent branches, the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSEQ) and Physics (RSEF). Successors of the work of the parent company held their biennial meeting in Burgos, 29 September to 3 October 1980. In the following years the focus groups were widespread within the RSEQ, and biennial meetings continued. The publication Annals of Chemistry was divided into three series between 1980 and 1989: *Annals of Chemistry / Series A, Physical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, ( , CODEN AQSTDQ) *Annals of Chemistry / Series B, Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, (, CODEN AQSAD3) *Annals of Chemistry / C Series, Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (, CODEN AQSBD6) From 1990 to 1995, subseries A, B and C are joined to form again Annals of Chemistry, (, CODEN ANQUEX). Between 1996 and 1998 the magazine changed its name to Annals of Chemistry, International Edition, (, CODEN AQIEFZ) and published in English during this period. In 1998 it merged with other European publications, to edit together several magazines in English, but the tradition of publishing in Spanish with the founding in 1999 of continuing Annals of the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry (Annals RSEQ), , quarterly.  Publications  Since 1999, Annals of the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry, , is published quarterly. This journal is a continuation of classical Annals of Chemistry, which was integrated into a consortium of European magazines along with Acta Chimica Hungarica, Models in Chemistry, Bulletin des Soci√©t√©s Chimiques Belges, Bulletin of Soci√©t√© Chimique de France, Chemische Berichte, Chimika Chronika, Gazzetta Chimica Italiana, Liebigs Annalen, Polish Journal of Chemistry, Recueil des Travaux des Pays-Bas Chimiques and Revista Portuguesa de Qu√≠mica. The Association of European Journals in partnership with Wiley-VCH publishes several magazines: Chemistry - A European Journal, European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, European Journal of Organic Chemistry, ChemBioChem, ChemMedChem and ChemSusChem. The RSEQ is also co-editor of the journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry (published by Springer ) and Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP), published by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

This species is endemic to the B√≠o B√≠o Region, the Araucan√≠a Region and the Los Lagos Regions of Chile. Description Pristidactylus torquatus is a robust lizard with strong legs and a large head. The back is generally reddish-brown with large patches of grey and there is a dark collar around the throat. The underside is paler and the region round the vent is greenish-yellow. This lizard grows to a snout-to- vent length of about . Distribution and habitat Pristidactylus torquatus is endemic to Chile where it is found on the west side of the Andes between 35¬∞ and 42¬∞ south. The regions in which it is found are Biob√≠o, La Araucania and Los Lagos. Its natural habitat is the extensive southern beech forests (Nothofagus) that grow in this temperate climate. Behaviour Pristidactylus torquatus is a terrestrial species and is found mainly on the ground under the forest trees. It feeds chiefly on beetles which it chews up with its strong jaws. The female lays a clutch of about six eggs in a hole in the sand. Status The IUCN has listed Pristidactylus torquatus as being of \\"Least Concern\\" because of its wide range and the lack of any identified threats to the species. Although the Nothofagus forests are being felled, they are being replaced by stands of Eucalyptus and this does not seem to have adversely impacted the lizard.

He built the Alberga manor house in the village of Storhoplaks. In 1624, Alberga was created an allodial freehold estate. In 1628 he exchanged M√§kkyl√§ for Tr√§sk√§nda village ( now the manor of J√§rvenper√§ ) in the same parish. On 16 November 1646 Johan Guldener was ennobled with the name of Gylden√§r and introduced in 1650 in the House of Nobility Riddarhuset with the number 388. In 1647, he was a Major in the Viborg ( now Viipuri, Finland ) Infantry Regiment, which was sent to Riga. He was the commander of the Vargsk√§rs fort of Helsingfors ( now Helsinki ) in 1656 and 1658. He retired in 1664 with the rank of Major and the thanks \\"for his gracious services of many years\\" [ for sina hulda och l√•ngvariga tj√§nster ]. He died around 1685 at the age of 87 years. His wife was Elin Horn af Kankas, the daughter of the Royal Councilor Arvid Horn af Kankas from Finland ( Family No. 12 in Riddarhuset ) and his second wife, Ingeborg Iwarsdotter Stjernkors ( Family No. 39 ). They had three children.  Daughters  Daughter Ingeborg was married twice ‚Äì in 1654, to Lieutenant Antonius Creutzhammer ( Family No. 200 ), who died in 1657, and his cousin, Governor Friherre [ Baron ] Arvid Horn af √Öminne ( Family No. 2 ) ( 1631 ‚Äì 1692 ) but they were married without the permission from the King of Sweden so they were hauled to the Hovr√§tt, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Sweden, in √Öbo ( now Turku, Finland ) for the punishment. Ramsay believed that there was another daughter, Margaretha who married a Livonian noble, Hendrik Bergh, a Captain in the Viborg Cavalry Regiment, and who died before 1705.  Sons  Anrep stated in 1861 that Johan had two sons, who followed him to the military but Ramsay, writing in 1909, believed that they were actually Johan's son and grandson. Johan's son, Arvid, rose through the ranks of the Swedish Army. He began in 1644 as a Corporal in his father's old regiment, the Viborg Infantry Regiment, but, by 1655, he was a Lieutenant in the Nyland ( now Uusimaa, Finland ) Cavalry Regiment. He was a Major in 1665 and Lieutenant Colonel in 1669 with the cavalry of Colonel Kock von Crimstein. Then he was Lieutenant- Colonel in 1672 and Colonel in 1677 with the cavalry of Count Leonhard Wittenberg. He finished as the Commandant of Varberg in 1689. He died in 1710. He married Gertrud Dorothea Bergh of Livonian nobility but, in 1669, they separated. From her, he wrote that he had \\"for a long time endured great discomfort, contempt and injury\\" [ en l√•ng tid bort√•t utst√•tt stort besv√§r, f√∂rakt och skada ]. According to Anrep, they had six children but Ramsay counted only five. Anrep wrote three of their four sons followed their father to the military but only one of them, Ernst (Ernst Arvid, according to Ramsay), a Captain of Infantry, had a wife and children. All his three sons also joined the Army but they all died as childless bachelors so Arvid's branch became extinct in the male line However, the line of Johan's other son, Anders Eric, survived. Ramsay identified him as Erik, the actual son of Ernst. But she agreed with Anrep on the basic facts of this man's life. Erik was Quartermaster with Colonel Fritz Wachtmeister's twin cavalry regiments in 1678 during its march to Prussia. Erik was a Captain-Lieutenant with the √Öbo and Bj√∂rneborg ( now Pori, Finland ) regiments of cavalry in 1694 and resigned his commission in 1701. He was still living as late as 1711. He also married into the nobility. His wife Catharina Ramsey was the daughter of cavalry captain Hans Ramsey (Family No. 215, founded by a Scottish immigrant [Julia Maria] Jully Ramsay, ‚ÄúRamsay.‚Äù, Fr√§lsesl√§kter i Finland intill stora ofreden, Tredje H√§ftet, M-S [ Noble Families of Finland Before the Greater Wrath, Third Volume, M-S ] (Helsingfors: F√∂rlagsaktiebolaget S√∂derstr√∂m & Co., 1915), pages 327-331. ), whose estate of Pitkjerfvi ( now Pitk√§j√§rvi, near Somero, Finland ) passed to Erik and his wife, and Anna Ljuster ( Family No. 111 ). But the couple had only one child, a son who became a cavalry officer in the Swedish Army on both sides of the Baltic Sea. He did marry and have children but his sons and grandsons kept joining the military and several of them died without any issue. By 1861, although there were already daughters, the branch of Anders Eric had dwindled to three elderly brothers, the sons of his great- grandson. and ultimately failed in the male line in 1875. However, Ramsey believed in 1909 that there still might be descendants living in Finland.

Engineers from BS PZ In≈º. made new designs, but they remained only in drawings. As a consequence, it was decided to purchase the engines manufactured by Maybach, which meet the needs of engineers (300 HP). By the end of 1938, about 60% of the work was completed, and in March 1939, the first tests were planned. However, it turned out that the company has sent 2 defective copies. Talks about the requirement to replace the damaged goods to more powerful semi-automatic engines stalled, leading to a halt of the project.

She was at the Zoo until February 2017, when she traveled to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province.  Life  Bao Bao was born on August 23, 2013, at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. The cub of Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, Bao Bao is a result of artificial insemination of Mei Xiang on March 23, 2013. Giant pandas are listed as vulnerable species, and are protected in part by conservation efforts at reservations and in zoos such as the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C. Bao Bao is one of only several hundred giant pandas alive today in captivity, among fewer than 2,000 giant pandas in the world, and one the first surviving panda cub born at the National Zoo since Tai Shan in 2005. In 2013, there were an unusually high number of giant panda cub births in zoos around the world. In addition to Bao Bao, other giant panda cubs were born in 2013 include: Yuan Zai in Taiwan, twin cubs Mei Lun and Mei Huan at Zoo Atlanta, Fu Bao at Zoo Vienna and Xing Bao at Zoo Madrid. = Naming ceremony and debut = Bao Bao was named 100 days after her birth. Her name was chosen by voters through the Smithsonian's website. Five names were originally submitted by various dignitaries and groups, including Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai, U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, panda keepers at the National Zoo, the fundraising group Friends of the National Zoo and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. The chosen name was submitted by Friends of the National Zoo. The five choices for names were Bao Bao(ÂÆùÂÆù), Ling Hua(Áé≤Ëä±), Long Yun(ÈæôÈüµ), Mulan(Êú®ÂÖ∞), and Zhen Bao(ÁèçÂÆù). Michelle Obama, First Lady of the United States, and Peng Liyuan, First Lady of China, each sent special video messages that were played during the naming ceremony. Bao Bao's birth, naming ceremony, and travel to China in 2017 are part of China's panda diplomacy. Bao Bao's public debut at the National Zoo was on January 18, 2014. = Development = By August 19, 2014, Bao Bao could stand on her hind legs when keepers asked, and could recognize her name when it is called by familiar voices. She did not yet consistently respond as an adult giant panda would, even to her mother Mei's unique bleat. More often, she moved inside when called instead of remaining in her favorite trees, napping or resting. She had learned to follow Mei outside most days, and was rarely carried out any more. Bao Bao was being trained in targeting behaviors; she was touching her nose to a target at about five months. By August, she could follow one partway inside from the outdoor yard. She also started raiding Mei's bamboo supply and sampling it, another major milestone. Fruitsicles were her preferred reward over cooked sweet potato, corn syrup, and diluted apple juice. Bao Bao Bao Bao celebrated her first birthday on August 23, 2014, with a giant birthday cake made of frozen fruits and vegetables. Crowds of visitors gathered at the zoo to celebrate her birthday. On the afternoon of December 23, 2014, Bao Bao climbed a tree after touching a \\"hot wire\\". Responding to inquiries from concerned members of the public, the zoo stated that this was a natural reaction to the \\"hot wire\\", and that Bao Bao was safe and comfortable in the tree. After over 24 hours in the tree, Bao Bao safely climbed down on her own, late on December 24. A YouTube video was released by the National Zoo on Tuesday, January 6, 2015, of Bao Bao's first encounter with snow. On Thursday, February 19, 2015, in an online news release by her keepers at the National Zoo's David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat and Panda House, found on the National Zoo's website in the \\"Meet Our Animals\\" section, on the Giant Panda page news updates, it was stated that Bao Bao is about 18 months- a year and a half- old, another major milestone. The statement said, around this time, \\"... they stop nursing and start living separately from their mothers. Bao Bao started the weaning process naturally a few months ago, and now she‚Äôs eating significantly more bamboo and solid foods. She also eats separately from Mei Xiang and spends about 6 hours separated from her each day. They will spend increasingly more time apart until Bao Bao is living on her own. Bao Bao has been doing well during the time she spends apart from Mei. Our panda team expects that the process will be complete in early March. Last month our panda team and veterinarians performed an ultrasound along with human cardiologist Dr. Rosenthal on Mei Xiang (*Bao Bao's mother) as part of a routine checkup. She is in great health. Mei usually participates in ultrasounds when the panda team is monitoring her for possible pregnancies...\\" The rest of the release is viewable through this link. The separation was completed in early March 2015, as planned, and went well. Bao Bao celebrated her second birthday on August 23, 2015, one day after her mother Mei Xiang gave birth to twin pandas on August 22, 2015. Mei Xiang gave birth to twin males on August 22, 2015 at 5:35 pm and 10:07 pm. However, only one of the cubs, Bei Bei, survived. Bao Bao remained at the National Zoo until February 21, 2017, when she was sent to China. Once in China, she will participate in the species breeding program.

These crosses indicate their beliefs and superstitions as well as the wealth and standing of the people who erected them. Details such as accidents, occupations and prayer requests have survived, thanks to the extremely weather-resistant material of which the crosses are made. Their geographic distribution is centred on the basalt quarries of Mayen and Mendig, and covers an area with a radius of approximately 30 kilometres between the Rhine, Ahr and Moselle rivers. The exact number of monuments is not known. Local historian, Kurt M√ºller-Veltin, estimates that there are about 4,500 wayside crosses and about 6,000 grave crosses. The conservation of these monuments is undertaken by the Rhenisch Society for Monument Conservation (Rheinische Verein f√ºr Denkmalpflege).  Early examples  Wayside monuments known as Sch√∂pfl√∂ffel (\\"ladle\\") due to their shape, appeared up to the 16th century. The Nischenstock (\\"niche post\\") was derived from it but a cross was added above the niche.

Blessing stones  Some crosses were erected as \\"blessing stones\\" and had niches carved in them to hold the Blessed Sacrament (the host) during services as part of outdoor processions. File:Segenstein Hain.jpg16__ File:Segenstein Niederd√ºrenbach.jpg1699 File:L√ºtzingen.jpg1881  Grave crosses  Particularly impressive grave crosses from the 18th century have survived in Mayscho√ü and in D√ºmpelfeld. On one side is the image of Christ with various symbols; on the other there is an inscription with details of the deceased. File:Portrait D√ºmpelfeld.jpgCross depicting the man of sorrows File:Schriftseite D√ºmpelfeld.jpgInscription side of a basalt grave cross File:Sieben Schwerter D√ºmpelfeld.jpgCross with Seven Swords image File:Ertrunken Ahrbr√ºck.jpgCross of drowned person  Protection, defence and atonement  In the Early and High Middle Ages crosses were understood to provide protection from lightning, hail and other natural catastrophes. Atonement crosses were also erected in some places to provide satisfaction following murders and other serious crimes. Even unusual accidents were often a reason to put up a cross.  Inscriptions and house marks  The inscriptions are usually in German with dialectical influences. Years were given in Roman numerals to begin with, but later Arabic numerals were used. A commonly used abbreviation was D.S.G.G. which meant Der Seele Gott Gnade (\\"God have mercy on the soul\\"). The photograph shows an example of maximum economy in inscription writing e.g. MARIA MAR_I_A House marks are signs and ownership symbols of the clans or noble families. These marks may be used to work out when the deceased or donor lived.  Workshops  Originally the crosses were not produced in special workshops, but were by products of other stonemason businesses. Around 1630 specialist cross workshops emerged and crosses can usually be classified from the inscription style of the stonemason.  Material  Strictly speaking, the lava rock that was used from the quarries between Mayen and Mendig was not basalt, but a so-called tephrite lava. This scientific distinction did not make its way into every speech, however, as formerly all black, volcanic rock was described here as \\"basalt\\". The rock is relatively easy to work thanks to its coarse pores, but so weather-resistant that it survives for centuries without being significantly affected.

The Giving Keys is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, United States, and can be found in over 1200 retail locations worldwide, including Nordstrom, TOMS Marketplace, Kitson, Fred Segal, Anthropologie, Sevenly, and Altar'd State.  History  The Giving Keys was founded in 2008. Founder Caitlin Crosby has detailed the origins of The Giving Keys in The Huffington Post and at a TEDx event (TEDxBend). Crosby took to wearing an old hotel key as jewelry and one day asked a locksmith to engrave the word LOVE on the key. As friends and fans took interest in her key, she decided to make her own line of key necklaces with inspiring words on them to sell at her concerts. Shortly after launching the jewelry line, Crosby attended a movie screening by Invisible Children in Hollywood. Touched by the experience, she struck up conversation with a homeless couple (named Rob and Cera) outside the movie theater after the film. Crosby offered to take the couple out for a meal and complimented Cera on her necklace. Cera mentioned that she designed it herself, and in a moment of impulse, Crosby invited the couple to be her business partners and help her produce her high-demand jewelry. Over the few years, the company has grown rapidly; as of August 2014 TGK has employed 19 people transitioning out of homelessness. The Giving Keys has been featured on The Today Show, and in Elle, People, E! News, Last Call with Carson Daly, MTV, Relevant magazine, and The Huffington Post.

In 1978, the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, along with Aachen Cathedral, was the first monument on German soil to be entered in the List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Entry in the UNESCO list The Treasury contains works from Late Antique, Carolingian, Ottonian, Staufen, and Gothic times. The exhibits are displayed in premises connected to the Cathedral cloisters.  Collection and arrangement  In 1995, the Cathedral Treasury was completely refurnished in accordance with the newest conservation and pedagogical knowledge. An area of over 600 m2 contains over a hundred artworks, divided into five thematic groups. One conceptional area is the documentation of the Cathedral as the church of Charlemagne. The late gothic silver-gilt Bust of Charlemagne, a model for countless later reliquaries stands in the centre of this section. The Persephone sarcophagus, the Roman marble sarcophagus of the early third century in which Charlemagne was buried in the Cathedral is also here. Olifant and the so-called Hunting Knife of Charlemagne (with sheath) Among the objects in the Cathedral Treasury which were connected with Charlemagne is an Olifant from eleventh century (Saracen) Southern Italy or the east, which was long considered the Hunting Horn of Charlemagne. There is also the so-called Hunting Knife of Charlemagne, dating to the eighth century. It and the Petrusmesser in the Bamberg Cathedral Treasury are the only known Medieval knives that were kept above ground and therefore had a special significance from the beginning. All other similar pieces have been found in archaeological contexts. The hunting knife, made of Damascus steel is classified as Anglo- Saxon or Scandinavian. The associated sheath probably dates to the eleventh century and bears an Old English inscription, reading BRHTZIGE MEC FECID (Brythsige made me).Herta Lepie, Georg Minkenberg, Die Schatzkammer des Aachener Domes. Aachen: Brimberg, 1995, , p. 21. The second section contains objects connected to the liturgy, including the Cross of Lothair (still used today on special occasions), the Aachen Altar, the Carolingian Treasury Gospels, a masterpiece of medieval illumination. In addition there is also the late gothic pieces of goldsmith Hans von Reutlingen. Artworks which were used at Aachen at the Coronations of the Holy Roman Emperor between 936 and 1531 form a third thematic category, including the masterfully produced ivory situla,Rose-Marie Schulz-Rehberg, Die Aachener Elfenbeinsitula: Ein liturgisches Gef√§√ü im Spannungsfeld von Imperium und Sacerdotium: Eine kunst- historische Analyse. M√ºnster: Monsenstein und Vannerdat, 2006, . a vessel for Holy water made in Trier around the year 1000 and decorated with rich reliefs, as well as the Ottonian Liuthar Gospels which are exemplary of their period. Reliquaries containing the so-called 'three small relics' of Aachen Cathedral Treasury The relics of the Cathedral and the pilgrimage to Aachen (particularly the Aachen pilgrimage) and the cathedral as a church of Mary are the fourth and fifth categories. The reliquaries and the so-called Hungarian Donations, as well as pictures and sculptures of the Theotokos are displayed here. Gems which donors and patrons (often clergy) gave to the Cathedral treasury are displayed in vitrines. Items from the rich textile collection of the treasury are in constant rotation in the basement, with the coronation cloak, the Cappa Leonis (c.1520), falsely named after Pope Leo III in the centre.  History= Treasury = \\"Since I have seen every royal marvel, [I know that] no-one living has seen a more marvellous thing,\\" wrote Albrecht D√ºrer in his travel diary, when he visited Aachen in 1520 on the occasion of the Coronation of Emperor Charles V. By some miracle, the unique collection, the most important north of the Alps, has survived intact in the Cathedral and its Treasury to this day. Its outstanding position is due to the fact that Aachen Cathedral hosted the coronations of thirty Kings of the Romans between 936 and 1531. Only after being anointed at Aachen could the ruler be crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome. Countless precious objects entered the collection as royal donations, others were essential parts of the coronation ceremonies. As they grew over the centuries, the contents had a tumultuous history. They were sent away during the Thirty Years' War and again in 1794 when the French Revolutionary troops occupied Aachen and incorporated it into the d√©partement of the Roer. In August of that year the treasure was taken to the Collegium Liborianum, the Capuchin monastery in Paderborn, where the three items of Imperial Regalia hitherto in the possession of the Cathedral college (the Carolingian Coronation Gospels, the Sabre of Charlemagne and St. Stephen's Purse were separated and taken to Vienna. Since then the Aachen Imperial Regalia has remained in the Imperial Treasury, Vienna. Disputes over the ownership of these items continue to this day. In 1804 Marc-Antoine Berdolet, the first Bishop of Aachen, gave two pieces of the collection to Empress Jos√©phine, when she visited Aachen to bathe, as a thanksgiving for the return of the Treasure to Aachen which had been arranged by her husband Napoleon Bonaparte. Of these gifts, the Staufen arm-reliquary is now in the Louvre in Paris and the Talisman of Charlemagne is in the treasury of Reims Cathedral.Franz Kaufmann, Vom Talisman Karls des Gro√üen: Kanonikus Anton Joseph Blees und der Aachener M√ºnsterschatz zur Zeit der franz√∂sischen Revolution: Zwei Abhandlungen zur Geschichte des M√ºnsterschatzes. Aachen: Creutzer, 1920. Towards the end of the First World War the Treasure was once again taken to Paderborn on account of imminent air raids. It was returned in 1922. At the beginning of the Second World War, the Treasury was taken to B√ºckeburg Palace along with the treasure of other churches in the diocese and of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum. However, the palace soon proved unsuitable for the storage of such important artworks. Therefore, in 1941, Heinrich Himmler had a list of \\"Items important to the Reich and items unimportant to the Reich\\" drawn up and the fourteen \\"Items important to the Reich\\" were taken to Albrechtsburg in Meissen. These items included the Karlsschrein, the Marienschrein, Bust of Charlemagne, the Cross of Lothar, the ivories, the codices, and the two great Gothic reliquaries (Charlemagne's reliquary and Three Towers reliquary). The rest of the collection was sent back to Aachen Cathedral where they were carefully walled up in the south tower of the Westwerk. At the urging of the Reichskonservator Robert Hiecke and Provinzialkonservator Franz Wolff-Metternich who was in close contact with Cathedral chapter and the civic administration, the pieces stored at Albrectsburg were taken to Siegen on 13 September 1944 (as the citizens remaining in Aachen were being evacuated to Thuringia) and were stored there, in Hain Tunnel, along with the Essen Cathedral Treasury, the Trier Cathedral Treasury, the most valuable items of the Rheinish Museums and the wooden doors of St. Maria im Kapitol. On Easter Monday 1945, the young vicar Erich Stephany, accompanied by the American art protection officer Walker Hancock, set out for Siegen, to inspect the six boxes of stored Treasure. On 7 May he left for Siegen again, to bring the Treasure back to Aachen. However, the delivery was delayed by the Capitulation of the Wehrmacht signed the same day. The collection was only returned on 26 May thanks to Hancock, who prevented their transfer to Marburg, loaded the Treasure, copies of the Imperial Regalia, and the wooden doors of St Maria in a lorry without authorisation and transported them to Aachen and Cologne. = Treasury Chamber = Until 1979, the Treasure was housed in a 90 m2 room from Carolingian times on the east side of the cloisters. In 1975, on account of the significance of the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, the Federal Ministry of Regional Planning, Building and Urban Development decided to erect a Test Bunker for the Protection of Artefacts. Because only a short journey could guarantee a safe transfer in an emergency, the cathedral chapter decided to build a new Treasury on the west side of the cloisters in the immediate proximity of the bunker. Planning and construction took place from 1975 to 1979. In 1979 the new exhibition room came into service. The items were exhibited to the public in chronological order in three rooms with a floorspace of 490 m2. In time, however, technical shortcomings presented themselves, which endangered the masterpieces. Therefore, a new arrangement was organised in 1995, to meet conservation, technical, and safety requirements.Herta Lepie, Der Domschatz zu Aachen. Clemens M. M. Bayer et al.

It is a popular entrance into the system, being one of the easiest, driest, and having just two vertical pitches to contend with. It lies within the designated Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description A descending passage at the base of the large rocky shakehole leads to a pitch, which is restricted at the top. Below the pitch a step down leads to the top of the Greasy Slab, a slab normally negotiated with a handline. This drops into Bridge Hall. At the bottom of the boulder slope Horrocks' Way on the left leads into a further set of descending chambers. At the bottom of these are the two pitches into South- East Passage of Gaping Gill. The main pitch () is straight ahead and can be reached by traversing round the ledge on the left, or by crawling forward from the bottom of the slope. An alternative (and the original) route to the Big Pitch is also accessed from the bottom of the entrance pitch. A wide bedding passage leads to the right. Across the other side a climb leads to a pitch. At the bottom of this a thin rift drops into a low bedding which soon enlarges and morphs into Whitehall, a high rift passage. At the bottom turn left to arrive at the back of the platform overlooking the Big Pitch. Other passages of note: * A small passage to the left at the base of the entrance pitch drops into the top of Bridge Hall. * Veering right after the pit in the wide bedding leading off from the base of the entrance pitch leads to Small Mammal House and the alternative entrances of Small Mammal Pot and Stile Pot. * A passage to the right at the bottom of Bridge Hall (Leakey's Way) leads into Whitehall. * A traverse round to the right of Bridge Hall leads into the Graveyard Inlet which almost reaches the surface. * A climb in the Bridge Hall Aven leads into Violet Ground Beetle Passage, another inlet series. * A passage across from the Big Pitch on the left leads to an alternative descent down South-East Aven, and also to Wild Cat Rift, a passage which descends to the hole in the wall opposite the bottom of the Big Pitch. * A rope climb above the start of the traverse to the normal descent of the Big Pitch enters Horrocks-Stearn Crawl which leads into Flood Entrance Pot near the top of the main pitch. Small Mammal Pot () may be found in a patch of clints from the top of the path down into the Bar Pot shakehole. A climb down enters a passage which almost immediately drops down a pitch into Bar Pot's Small Mammal House. Small Mammal House was named after the piles of small mammal bones found on the floor when it was first explored, so it was evident that a connection to the surface was close by. Stile Pot () is in the shakehole below Small Mammal Pot near the wall-stile. A steeply descending passage, loose and tight in places, emerges through the floor of Small Mammal House. History The cave was first entered in 1949 by members of the British Speleological Association, who moved a few boulders at the bottom of the shakehole. The original route to the Big Pitch was through the bedding below the entrance pitch, down the pitch, and through Whitehall. Bob Leakey then discovered the route from Bridge Hall to Whitehall, and Ken Horrocks discovered the passage named after him which is now the voie normale. Wild Cat Rift was explored by members of the Northern Cave Club from below in 1969. Small Mammal House and the Graveyard Inlet was discovered by members of Lancaster University Speleological Society in the late 1970s, and Violet Ground Beetle Passage was first entered by John Cordingley in 1993. The alternative entrance of Small Mammal Pot was opened up from below by Mike Wooding and John Gardner in 2005. The alternative entrance of Stile Pot was opened up by John Gardner, John Sellers, Dave Checkley and Phil Johnstone in 2008. In 1959, Eric Sugden died when he fell down the entrance pitch whilst rigging it. In 1980 Lancaster University Speleological Society published a comprehensive survey of the cave. In 1987 the management of Ingleborough Show Cave submitted a planning application to develop Bar Pot for adventure caving tourist trips. The plans included setting up scaffolding structures supporting ladders for the two pitches, but the application was withdrawn after objections were voiced by a number of interested parties including the British Cave Research Association, the Nature Conservancy Council, and the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The actress's casting was first announced in September 2013, while a promotional trailer for the character was also released. Beck commented that she loved playing Gem because she pushed boundaries. The character made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 October 2013. She departed on 10 January 2014, with series producer Jason Herbison commenting that she could return in the future. Gem was introduced as the cousin of established characters Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). She was portrayed as \\"a schemer\\", \\"cunning\\", manipulative and having \\"a nasty streak\\". Using her position as a biology teacher, Gem sabotaged some of her students, while also encouraging Bailey Turner's (Calen Mackenzie) crush on her. Gem later used Bailey to achieve her own needs. Gem's obsession with Georgia led her to manipulate and isolate her from her friends and fianc√©. After showing her true colours, Gem attacked Georgia and left her for dead. Critical opinion on the character has been mostly positive. She has been described as someone \\"viewers love to hate\\", a \\"superbitch\\" and a \\"fun whacko\\", but Gem also been called \\"one of the soap's most irritating characters\\". One critic thought Beck was doing \\"an excellent job\\" and the character's appearance and introduction also received positive attention. Casting In September 2013, the show's then executive producer Richard Jasek teased Gem's introduction, saying established character Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) would have \\"a relative coming to visit, who's going to cause absolute merry hell for everyone.\\" That same month a promotional trailer previewing Gem's arrival was released. The character had previously been mentioned on-screen by her family members, but had never been seen before. It was also announced that actress Kathryn Beck had been cast in the guest role of Gem. Beck commented \\"I loved playing Gem because she pushes all the boundaries and just when you think she has gone too far, she goes further.\\" The actress made her first screen appearance as Gem during the episode broadcast on 7 October 2013. Development=Introduction and characterisation= Gemma, better known as Gem, is the cousin of Georgia Brooks and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). She comes to Erinsborough to catch up with Georgia, who is her favourite cousin and someone she has idolised since they were children. Shortly after arriving in town, Gem literally bumps into Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) and he spills coffee down herself. Unaware that Kyle is Georgia's boyfriend, Gem flirts with him and makes advances towards him. Beck explained \\"Gem comes on to him not realising who he is. It's very awkward!\\" A TV Week writer stated that the incident would not be the last time Gem would display strange behaviour and Beck added that when it becomes clear Gem is here to stay, things would get interesting. Georgia is happy to see her cousin and wanting her to stay around permanently, Georgia convinces Toadie to let Gem move into his house. Gem settles in well and tries to forge friendships with some of her new neighbours. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that just as things appear to be going well, it would become clear that Gem is keeping secrets surrounding her past. Gem was also billed as \\"a schemer\\" who would \\"rock Erinsborough to its core\\". Kilkelly also said that Gem seems obsessed with her cousin and would try to \\"divide and conquer\\" anyone who is close to her. Of her character, Beck commented \\"While Gem is cunning, she isn't necessarily convincing ‚Äì so a lot of people have worked out Gem has an agenda. But, I think viewers will still feel some sympathy for her.\\" When Gem eavesdrops on a private conversation between Kyle and Georgia's best friend, Kate (Ashleigh Brewer), Beck explained that this was a sign the layers were being pulled back to reveal Gem's real agenda and viewers would not be expecting it at all. =Sabotaging students= Toadie asks Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) to hire Gem as the new biology teacher at Erinsborough High when the position becomes vacant. After she is given the job, it emerges that Gem is scarred by a \\"scandalous\\" dismissal from her previous school and she assures her mother over the phone that she is ready to return to teaching. A Soap World columnist wrote \\"Now that she's comfortably settled into the school and the Rebecchi house, Gem's unable to shield her true personality any longer.\\" Showing \\"a nasty streak\\", Gem humiliates her student Josie Lamb (Madison Daniel), who is struggling with low self-esteem. When Kate learns of the incident, she talks to Georgia about Gem's behaviour, causing them to fall out. Gem then turns her attention to Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) and her intention to run for school captain. Gem becomes annoyed by Imogen's confidence and manipulates her friend Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) into standing against her. When she realises Imogen's confidence has not been crushed enough to force her to withdraw from the race, Gem decides to steal some votes for Imogen, so Amber will win. When Amber's younger brother Bailey (Calen Mackenzie) catches Gem out, he guilts her into replacing the votes, but he is unprepared when Gem propositions him into keeping his silence. =Manipulation of Bailey Turner and Georgia Brooks= Gem decides to use Bailey to her advantage and realises that his recent break- up has left him vulnerable to manipulation. An \\"uneasy chemistry\\" develops between the pair and Mackenzie stated that Gem makes Bailey believe that they could be more than just friends, calling the storyline not \\"your usual teacher/student dynamic.\\" Gem continues to encourage Bailey's crush on her and champions his place on a school trip to China. When Gem fakes an accident, Susan and Toadie's become suspicious about her motivations, while Gem uses Bailey's concern for her. She tells him that she is withdrawing her support for his placement on the China trip, saying that she cannot bear to be away from him. Seeing that Bailey is \\"smitten\\" with her, Gem believes she can use him to achieve her own needs. Gem starts to enjoy Bailey's attention and they develop \\"a firm friendship\\", which results in Imogen catching them holding hands at Lassiter's Lake. Imogen reports what she has seen to Susan, which leads to Gem threatening her. At the same time, Gem also begins causing trouble between Georgia and Kyle, by encouraging her cousin to apply for an overseas job. When Georgia and Kyle become engaged, Gem's displeasure at the event does not go unnoticed by Toadie, who contacts her mother looking for answers. Gem's mother then voices her concerns for her daughter's \\"erratic\\" behaviour, making Toadie suspicious of Gem. When Georgia notices the tension between Kate and Gem, she asks her cousin to be more friendly towards Kate. However, Kate angrily accuses Gem of being jealous of her close friendship with Georgia and that it is only a matter of time before Georgia sees what a horrible person she is. This causes Gem to try to find something on Kate that will cause more trouble. Using Bailey, Gem hacks Kate's laptop and finds an unsent email from Kate to Kyle, detailing a one-night stand between them. Gem then plants the email amongst the congratulatory notices at Georgia and Kyle's engagement party, exposing the affair. Gem is pleased when Georgia leans on her for support, but becomes \\"increasingly infuriated\\" by her inner strength and tries to isolate her, by taking her away to a private cottage. Beck told a TV Week writer that Gem is aware of how vulnerable Georgia is and realises that it is her chance to embed herself further in Georgia's life. At the cottage, Gem steals Georgia's phone, cutting her off from the outside world, and tells her the car will not start when she wants to leave. Beck thought that what Gem does to keep Georgia to herself was \\"quite unhinged.\\" When Georgia finds her phone in Gem's bag and learns that Gem hacked into Kate's laptop, Gem shows her true colours. The cousins argue and Georgia inadvertently turns the gas stove on, before she is knocked unconscious. Gem panics and then flees the scene of the crime. The storyline formed part of the show's season finale and Beck added that \\"everything is unravelling for Gem.\\" Gem made her last screen appearance on 10 January 2014. When asked if Gem would return in the future, series producer Jason Herbison commented that there was certainly scope for her to return. Storylines While she is coming out of Grease Monkeys, Gem runs into Kyle Canning and spills her coffee down herself. She takes off her top and Kyle gives her his shirt and offers to buy her a new coffee. She tells Kyle her name is Ursula and she flirts with him, but becomes angry when Kyle tells her he has a girlfriend. Gem turns up at Number 30 to see her cousin Georgia and is surprised to see Kyle. She apologises for lying about her name and asks Kyle to keep their first meeting a secret. Gem and Georgia's cousin Toadie allows Gem to stay with his family and Gem meets Georgia's best friend Kate Ramsay. While dancing with Georgia, Gem hurts her hip and Toadie reveals that Gem was involved in a serious quad biking accident, which left her in a coma. During that time, her fianc√© left her for another woman. Gem is interviewed by Susan Kennedy for a teaching post at Erinsborough High, but fails to impress her. Toadie convinces Susan to give Gem a chance, and Gem is given a job as a Biology teacher. Gem favours the boys over the girls during her classes and her teaching ability is questioned. Gem tells Georgia about her first meeting with Kyle, which briefly causes tension between Georgia and Kyle. Gem destroys Josie Lamb's already fragile self-confidence, and she then drives a wedge between Kate and Georgia. Gem proposes that she and Georgia rent Number 24; however, she cancels the application when Georgia tells her that Kyle will be moving in too. She is caught out by Kyle and Georgia and Gem tells Georgia that she could not face living with a couple. When Imogen Willis runs for school captain, Gem becomes annoyed with her confidence and tries to rig the vote. Bailey catches her out and threatens to report her, but Gem manipulates Bailey into believing that she has feelings for him. Gem continues to encourage Bailey's crush on her, while Imogen begins questioning Gem's teaching methods. Imogen later spots Gem and Bailey holding hands and tells Susan. Gem looks through Imogen's school file and learns Imogen is suffering from bulimia. Gem threatens to reveal Imogen's condition, but Imogen opens up to her classmates herself. Gem is not happy when Georgia and Kyle get engaged and fakes an injury to take the attention away from them. She is pleased when Bailey visits her in hospital and tells him she does not want him to go on a school trip, as she will miss him. Gem asks Bailey to hack into Kate's laptop, claiming that Kate is plotting against her. They find an unsent email from Kate to Kyle detailing their one-night stand. When she learns Georgia and Kyle plan to move into number 24 alone, she buys a dress to outshine Georgia at her engagement party and puts Kate's email amongst the congratulations messages, where Georgia reads it out. A devastated Georgia leans on Gem for support and agrees to go away to a private cottage with her. After they leave, Toadie learns from Gem's mother that Gem caused her quad bike accident to trap her fianc√© into marriage. Bailey also admits that Gem got him to hack into Kate's laptop. At the cottage, Georgia finds her phone in Gem's bag and learns Gem hacked Kate's laptop. Georgia confronts Gem, who pushes her into a cooker, causing the gas to come on. Georgia tries to leave and Gem pushes her again, causing Georgia to hit her head and fall unconscious. Gem panics and leaves Georgia alone in the gas filled cottage. A couple of days later, Gem leaves Georgia's car at the hospital and meets with Bailey. He tells Gem that Georgia is fine, but she is shocked when he tells her the gas was on when she left. Gem assures Bailey that it was all an accident. Bailey suggests Gem explains herself to the police, then reveals that he read Gem's diary. Gem goes to the hospital with a cut hand, and apologises for leaving Georgia in the cottage alone. Gem gets agitated when Kate and Kyle come into the room and she tells Georgia that Kate loves Kyle. The police then take Gem for questioning and arrange for a psychological evaluation, where she is given some medication. Georgia comes to say goodbye, saying she is grateful that she knows about Kate and Kyle, but is not happy about the way it happened. Toadie then takes Gem to meet her mother in Birregurra. Reception A reporter from the Sunday Mail liked Gem's introduction, calling it \\"a classic move\\". They added that she was \\"an attractive stranger\\". Another reporter for the publication commented that she \\"may not be the most reliable teacher\\". A TV Week columnist branded Gem a \\"hottie\\" and a \\"blonde bombshell\\". Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, commented that Gem \\"has dangerously unstable eyes.\\" Butler also quipped \\"Gem is the greatest strategist since Kevin Rudd\\" and said she could not wait to see how things ended between her and Georgia. Melinda Houston from The Sun- Herald praised both the character and actress, saying \\"There's something enduringly creepy about the Single White Female and the addition of Gem to Ramsay Street makes a nice variation on the assorted femme fatales and bad boys that are Neighbours usual fodder. And Kathryn Beck (Home and Away, East of Everything) is doing an excellent job.\\" John Burfitt from TV Week hoped Gem would be sticking around \\"so there's a bad girl in town.\\" Gem was also included in TV Week's \\"screen meanies\\" feature, where a columnist wrote \\"Move over, Paul Robinson, Erinsborough has a new baddie!\\" The columnist said Gem's most villainous act was leaving Georgia for dead. Rebecca Lake from the same publication called her a \\"fun whacko\\".The Age's Larissa Dubecki said \\"Another year, another psycho alert in the Anglo-Saxon enclave of Erinsborough\\", while also branding Gem \\"increasingly unstable\\". A writer for TV Soap observed that the addition of \\"superbitch\\" Gem was another new direction for Neighbours and that she was the first bad girl \\"viewers love to hate\\" since Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte). The Daily Star's Peter Dyke and Katie Begley called Gem \\"an evil schemer\\".

It is one of several smaller ports being rapidly expanded in Liaoning Province in order to service the Northeast. Setting Huludao Port opens to the middle section of Liaodong Bay. The port location was originally selected by British engineers hired by the Qing government, who considered that the shelter provided by the nearby mountains gave it an advantage over existing ports and alternative sites alike.http://www.kc86.com/knowledge_show/show/16778.shtml  History  The Port of Huludao was founded in 1908 by the then Qing governor Xu Shichang as a way to provide an alternative to the overloaded Qinghuangdao and Yingkou ports. Construction work started in 1910, only to stop abruptly with the outbreak of the 1911 Revolution. In 1930, Manchuria's warlord Zhang Xueliang once more started work, only to be thwarted again by the Mukden Incident. It was only during Japanese occupation that the port was completed to an annual capacity of 1 million tons. After the war, the Port was mostly used as a naval base by the PLAN. It was only in 1984 that it started by shared for civilian use again, and in 1997 that it was fully reopened for internal trade. It was only in 2007 that it was reopened for foreign trade.http://www.kc86.com/knowledge_show/show/16778.shtml Current plans hope to make the port into a 100 million ton throughput port by 2016.http://ln.sina.com.cn/city/csgz/2012-05-29/182.html Layout Huludao Port operates in four port areas. The main area is the Liutaogou Port Area (), with 4 berths being expanded to 7. The North Port Area, opening to the Longwan Bay and the Xincheng Port Area to the southwest of the city are intended as general cargo ports.

His strongest research achievements are in the statistical pattern recognition (working in applications in medical sciences and technical diagnostics), as well as his work on fuzzy-rational decision analysis and ribbon-risk analysis. Personal details and aspirations Kiril Tenekedjiev Kiril Tenekedjiev was born to Ivan Kirilov Tenekedjiev (a mechanical engineer), and Tatiana Museevna Tenekedjieva (a French language high school teacher). He has a younger sister, Dessy Tenekedjieva, who has a career in acting, singing and movie producing. Kiril's upbringing was entrusted to his grandparents on his father's side, whom Kiril loved tremendously and lives with the dear memory of them till present day. His grandfather, Kiril Georgiev Tenekedjiev, was a very respected medical doctor in Varna, Bulgaria and Kiril was named after him. Kiril's grandmother, Dimitrichka Tenekedjieva (originally, Dimitra, but loved being called \\"Dimitrichka\\"), was an exceptional erudite and worked as a high-school teacher while raising her two sons. She was a graduate of a French lyceum. She was extremely methodical in shaping Kiril as a hard working, ambitious, organized and determined individual. alt=303x303pxKiril was passionate for sports since early age, with particular interests in water polo. He played for Cherno More water polo teamhttp://narodensport.eu/2013/09/16/%D0%9A%D0%9B%D0%A3%D0%91-%D0%9F%D0%9E-%D0%92%D0%9E%D0%94%D0%9D%D0%90-%D0%A2%D0%9E%D0%9F%D0%9A%D0%90-%D0%A7%D0%95%D0%A0%D0%9D%D0%9E-%D0%9C%D0%9E%D0%A0%D0%95-1948-%D1%80/ (most of the time with the junior team) in Varna, and was also selected and played with the Junior National water polo team of Bulgaria in his late highschool years. Starting his two-year military service in 1979, prior to university, he retired from active sports. His coach in water polo played a huge role in shaping Kiril's personality and understanding of life. While studying at the First Language High Schoolhttp://www.1eg.eu/English/index.html (English profile) in Varna, he also participated in school theater performances, and showed very good artistic skills. At the end of his teen years, he switched his focus from sports to mathematics, having a natural talent and inclination to mathematics since primary school. While not active in sports nowadays, Kiril is a fan of football and basketball. In 2007, while in a specialization under the Fulbright Visiting Scholarship program, he had the chance to again exercise his passion for water polo, this time while coaching the SUNY at Binghamton's team in water polo. He is a die-hard Liverpool Football Club fan, and also a passionate supporter of several other European soccer teams. Kiril has two daughters. His elder daughter - Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva - is a graduate in a Bachelor of Sciences program in Statistical Science of Duke University (with a thesis in Missing Data in Financial Modeling), and in 2020 is to complete her PhD degree in Finance with the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, USA. His younger daughter - Lea-Tereza Tenekedjieva - has finished an International Baccalaureate program with the United World Colleges in New Mexico, USA, and in 2019 has obtained her undergraduate degree in Human Biology with Stanford University, USA.  Education and academic career  Kiril Tenekedjiev obtained his mechanical engineering degree (both at Bachelor and Masters degree) in ship machines and equipment from the Technical University of Varna, Bulgaria in 1986. He was awarded a PhD degree in Engineering from Higher Attestation Committee of Bulgaria in 1994, undertaking his studies with Technical University - Varna. His Doctor of Sciences degree from 2004, awarded again by the Higher Attestation Committee of Bulgaria, was on a thesis entitled Decision Analysis: Utility Theory and Subjective Statistics. He was promoted to Full Professor again by the Higher Attestation Committee of Bulgaria while still employed by the Technical University of Varna, in 2008. Kiril started his academic career in 1986 right after graduation from university. He worked as Researcher (operator) with the Ship propellers and cavitation unit of the Bulgarian Ship Hydrodynamics Centre, Varna, Bulgaria (a research institute with industrial research orientation in mechanical engineering, hydrodynamics and cavitation). He worked on several research tasks there, related to his interests in mechanical engineering.

It is parchment copy of an ownership document from the cartulary of the Benedictine monastery of St John the Baptist. It is one of the oldest Croatian cultural and linguistic records, which through its content provides a number of interesting insights into the various aspects of the time in which it was made. The first modern edition was published in 1881 by Franjo Raƒçki in his book Starine (Antiquities). It is written in Bosnian Cyrillic script by Ivan, the canon of the Cathedral Church of Split and a Hvar notary, at the request of the Povlja abbot Ivan, and by order of the Bishop of Hvar Nikola. The template for the first part of the charter was Prince Breƒçko's charter from 1184, which regulated territorial relations between the estate of the monastery and the island's prince and ≈æupan. That template charter is almost entirely included within the Charter of Povlja. The terse list of monastic estates reveal the Old Croatian tribal and clan common law procedures, and legal formulations contain recognizable vernacular and literary expressions, absent in later legal documents. Today it is kept in the parish office in Puƒçi≈°ƒáa.  Language  In the text of the Charter, two language layers can be seen: the common national language, which is the Chakavian dialect of Braƒç, its linguistic superstructure is provided by the contemporary literary language, which is Old Church Slavonic of Croatian recension, that gave the whole text a more formal feel. There are also a considerable number of words of Romance origin. Its undifferentiated writing shows the author's knowledge of various contemporary Cyrillic schools on one side and the influence of Latin writing customs on the other. These influences reveal an important linguistic information. Namely, the unusualness of the use of graphs in the graphic series —£ (yat), —ã (yery), i and e indicates that in those region at that time there was already established an Ikavian reflex of the yat (with the possibility of some words being Ekavian).

His house and grounds in Glasgow became Benmore Botanic Garden, managed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Biography Duncan was born in 1834 in Greenock. He was the son of a second-hand bookseller.Philippe Chalmin In the early 1850s, James Duncan was studying chemistry at Glasgow. He had a break and took a boat trip from Greenock to the lochs and coastlines of Argyllshire. While on Loch Long, he conceived a unique method of refining sugar. He patented his idea for sugar refining. Then between 1858 and 1861, he became a partner of the Greenock firm of 'Duncan, Bell & Scott'. In 1854, the refinery was producing up to 50,000 tons.William H Marwick After 1861, he developed a factory in Silvertown, London, at Millbank 21 Mincing Lane, called the 'Clyde Wharf Refinery'. It was the largest and most profitable sugar refinery in London. He was always refining the process and learning different applications to keep his company at the top of the industry. At the peak of the business, they were producing up to 2 thousand tons of sugar a week. In 1878 he was elected fellow of the Society of Chemical Industry, later becoming its Vice-President. By 1879 he held the prestigious post of 'Chairman of the Sugar Refiners' Committee', and also became Vice-President of the 'Railway and Canal Traders' Union'. In 1884, cheap German sugar arrived in the UK, which was much cheaper than UK produced sugar. In August 1885, he published an article in the 'Sugar Cane' journal, titled 'The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States'. In 1886, the unfair foreign competition meant that he had to close his London works of Clyde Wharf. He returned to Scotland, to manage the smaller refinery business in Greenock. After he retired, he spent time with his sister 'Mary Moubray' in Strone, and then spent the winter months in Italy. Philanthropy James Duncan's charitable work was widely known throughout Britain. he gave 20 per cent of his annual ¬£100,000 salary to a range of causes, making him one of the most committed philanthropists of the time. He also built 2 churches for 2 different congregations. He was known as a major collector of fine art and was also a lender of pictures to annual exhibitions, including the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. In 1878, he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. He regularly contributed works to European exhibitions, including the most prestigious at the Paris Salon, and to key international exhibitions of art and industry in France and Germany in the 1870s and 1880s. He was the first Scottish collector of an Impressionist work including purchasing in 1883, Renoir's painting 'Bay of Naples'. The painting was later lent to the National Gallery of Scotland by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (who now own it), for a summer exhibition about James Duncan's collection. Duncan was also one of the most valued and important clients of the influential French picture dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, and regularly frequented the studios of Europe's most famous painters. He collected works by the likes of Raeburn and Corot, including Eug√®ne Delacroix's masterpiece Death of Sardanapalus'. He was friends with various people in different fields of work including; the chemist James \\"Paraffin\\" Young, who established the world's first commercial oil works; the pioneering ophthalmic surgeon 'Dr Neven Gordon Cluckie', whose work led to the establishment of eye surgeries in hospitals throughout Britain; the celebrated preacher Charles Spurgeon; Rev. Henry Boyd (Principal of Hertford College Oxford, 1878‚Äì1922), with whom Duncan had worked closely in the 1870s to improve working conditions in London's East End; and Gustave Dor√©, the French artist whose gallery, paintings and book illustrations proved so popular in Britain. ‚ÄúDuncan also employed his significant wealth in helping the poor in Scotland and England and improving the working conditions of his workforce, building churches and schools, providing medical care and introducing an eight-hour working day.\\" noted Peter Baxter (Benmore House Curator). Duncan had also been in contact with the eminent botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker and with Henry Morton Stanley, the explorer and friend of David Livingstone who visited Duncan some time in the 1870s or 1880s. In Kilmun, at Graham's Point there is a memorial to James Duncan. Which was designed by A. Macfarlane Shannon. Benmore House In 1870, James Duncan purchased Benmore House near Dunoon, Argyll. He then set about building a gallery (to showcase his large collection of fine arts. As well as a fernery and one of the largest greenhouses in Scotland. The estates amounted up to 12,260 acres of land. He made extensive improvements to the land. On some of which he grazed West Highland cattle and blackfaced sheep. The sheep were first seen at the Paris International Exhibition of 1878. His flock of sheep gained awards at the annual exhibitions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland. He also had over six million trees planted as part of the large landscape alterations he had designed. Including, commissioning features such as the 'Golden Gates'.Which were earlier shown at the Paris International Exhibition. Following the introduction of a German sugar bounty, Duncan had a massive loss of fortune and had to sell the estate in 1889. It was acquired by the Younger Family and later gifted to Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh It is now the Benmore Botanic Garden. His art collection at Benmore was split up and sold, his paintings are now housed in some of world's greatest museums such as the Louvre, the Belvedere in Vienna, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is home to four of Duncan's pictures.

Personal life The Turkish Parliament biographical file of Irmak is brief, listing her as a high-school graduate and single person. It was while she was studying to be a teacher at the Konya based Sel√ßuk University, when she was first arrested.  Political career and legal prosecution  In the 1990s, she spent almost ten years in prison on charges of membership of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). She was for several years a co-chair of the Democratic Society Party (DTP). In October 2008, she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for praising crimes and criminals. The court sentence was later commuted to a fine of 5,000 Turkish lira. She stood for mayor for Derik in the 29 March 2009 local elections. On 18 April 2009, while still co-chair of the DTP, she was again arrested, in a police operation in Mardin, and detained in Diyarbakƒ±r E Type Prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization. DTP members were targeted with large-scale arrests of April 2009. She is being tried alongside 175 other Kurdish politicians and political activists in the so-called mass 'KCK trial', which began in October 2010, and as of January 2014, is still ongoing. In 2011 she was elected as a member of Parliament representing the Sƒ±rnak province, but due to her arrest she could not be sworn in. The court ruled that the parliamentary immunity, which usually all Turkish Member of Parliaments have, does not apply in her case. Politicians from the Labour, Democracy and Freedom Block and other organizations protested against this ruling. In February 2012, she went on hunger strike along with many other fellow detainees and released a statement in support for Abdullah √ñcalan. She was freed on 4 January 2014, by decision of the Diyarbakir High Criminal Court. Her release came shortly after a landmark decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court in the case of Mustafa Balbay After her release she took her oath in the Turkish parliament on 7 January 2014 and became Co-Chair of the Democratic Society Congress (DTK), which she stayed until 2016. In the Parliamentary Elections in June and the Parliamentary Elections in November 2015 she was elected as an MP representing Hakkari for the party HDP. On the 4 November 2016 she was arrested upon terrorist charges and in November 2017 she was sentenced to 10 years in prison for being a member of a terrorist organization and disseminating terrorist propaganda. In March 2018 the sentence was upheld by a court in Gaziantep, and in the same year in April she was dismissed from Parliament. On the 15 January 2019 she declared she will join Leyla G√ºven in her hunger strike demanding better detention conditions for Abdullah √ñcalan.

He was the longest-serving chairman and CEO of the International Hat Company. Pellegrino built numerous factories across Southeastern Missouri, managing the company into becoming the largest manufacturing employer in the region by the 1960s. Pellegrino also engaged in numerous philanthropic projects throughout his life. Most notably, he established and funded municipal parks in Southeastern Missouri. His donations resulted in the founding of both George Tilles, Jr. Park and Maria Pellegrino Park.The Missourian. \\"$10,000 Gift, Voter Approval Bring City Park\\".

Retrieved January 8, 2014.  Early life  Pellegrino was the third of eight children and the only child not born in St. Louis. His father and mother emigrated from Italy in 1891 from Cerisano in Calabria, Italy. His father, Ferdinando Pellegrino, was a soldier in the Royal Italian Army in the late 19th century. He received American citizenship in 1896 after renouncing fealty to King Umberto I of Italy. With the death of Ferdinando's father in 1900, the family returned to Italy to sell the Cerisano farm. At this time, Italy was in the midst of a depression. While waiting the sale of the property, Pellegrino was born in 1901. It took several years to sell the property before the family permanently returned to the United States. As a teenager, Pellegrino began working for the International Hat Company in 1920, as a hat rack assembly lineman. Several years later, his sister Sarah and Josephine would join him as seamstresses for the company. At the age of 19, he married Ida Kropp, a fellow employee and German immigrant that worked as a seamstress at the plant.  Career  By the 1930s, Pellegrino served as Vice President of International Hat under George Tilles, Jr., the nephew of horse racing magnate Cap Tilles. During World War II, Pellegrino became chairman and CEO, serving until his death in 1975. He was a driving force for the production of military pith helmets for the United States Army, Navy, and Marines during World War II. Under his management, the company expanded to incorporate factories, warehouses, and sales offices throughout Missouri, Texas, New York, and Mexico.  Philanthropy  In 1962, Pellegrino donated land and money to establish the first municipal park in the history of Oran, Missouri. The park was dedicated as the George Tilles, Jr. Park in honor of Pellegrino's business associate and close friend. The site of Oran was chosen due to the International Hat factory Tilles and Pellegrino built there together. As a condition for founding the park, Pellegrino petitioned the city that future funding of the new recreational facilities and park upkeep be managed through municipal taxation. The measure was placed on the voting ballot and passed with 93 percent of voters approving. In 1969, Pellegrino donated land to Marble Hill, Missouri to form a new municipal park.The Missourian. \\"Dedicate New Park at Ceremonies Sunday\\", The Southeast Missourian, Cape Girardeau, June 2, 1972.

The first event had its epicentre somewhere in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula around Tabuk, while the second had its worse effect on the city of Ramla in Palestine, some 500 km farther northwest. The March earthquake affected the southern portion of the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system. The combined events were responsible for an estimated 20,000 deaths, of which some 15,000 only in Ramla, and caused damage in Greater Syria including Palestine where a tsunami made victims on the Mediterranean coast, in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and in areas to the east along the Euphrates such as al-Rahba and Kufa. Other strong earthquakes have occurred on the southern portion of the DST throughout history, impacting the wider region. Geological setting The Dead Sea Transform (DST) is a transform fault that spans from the Red Sea in the south to the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey to the north. The southern extent of the DST is known as the Wadi Araba fault (after the Arabah valley). This portion of the DST runs from north of Aqaba/Eilat to south of the Dead Sea and has a slip rate of 4 mm ¬±2 mm per year. The temporal pattern of large events has not been clarified yet, with only four well-documented large earthquakes reported in the Araba valley over the last few thousands of years occurring in 1068, 1212, 1293 and 1458 CE. In 1998, Zilberman thought to locate the epicentre of the 1068 event at the Avrona playa, i.e. in the southern part of the Arava Valley.Zilberman, Ezra; Amit, Rivka; Porat, Naomi; Enzel, Yehouda. Surface ruptures induced by the devastating 1068 AD earthquake in the southern Arava valley, Dead Sea Rift, Israel. Tectonophysics 408(1-4):79-99 (abstract), October 2005, . Accessed 22 August 2020.Klinger (2005), see References: Zilberman E. et al. (1998) Ambraseys (2005) separates between a March event with the epicentre near Tabuk, and a May event closer to Ramla. Effects The earthquake's effects were seen from as far north as Banias at the southern foot of Mount Hermon, to the Hejaz region of modern-day Saudi Arabia. The ancient city of Ayla, located at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba where modern Aqaba stands today, was destroyed. Palaeoseismic investigations have revealed more than of fault rupture, beginning just north of Aqaba/Eilat, that were dated between 900 and 1,000 years before present. A magnitude of at least 7.0 was presented based on the reported damage and the extent of the observed fault breaks. Alarm was caused at Saint Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula, and there was damage in the ancient city of Tinnis in the Nile delta, but not farther to the west along the Egyptian coast in Alexandria. In Cairo the only damage was to a corner of the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat. Seismologist Nicholas Ambraseys described one account of the effects at Ramla as destructive and with a large loss of life (15,000 deaths, 200 of which were boys at a school). He also expounded on the effects to the north in Banias, where 100 were killed, and in Jerusalem, where the roof of the Dome of the Rock was \\"displaced and then returned to its former position\\". Those that were affected by the heavy damage in Ramla apparently migrated to Jerusalem, which indicated to Ambraseys that the effects there were otherwise minimal. Other events In addition to the event in 1068, the southern portion of the DST has experienced three other historical events (all having an estimated magnitude of 6.5‚Äì7.0) with two in the northern section near the Dead Sea, and one closer to Aqaba. The event in 1212 caused significant damage to towns in the Arabah Valley as well as the destruction of a church on the Sinai Peninsula. In 1293, near the southern portion of the Dead Sea, an earthquake destroyed three towers of a castle and caused damage between the Dead Sea and Gaza. In 1458, another event again affected the southern Dead Sea area, this time causing a left-lateral offset at Qasr at-Tilah (\\"Tilah Castle\\", a Roman or Early Byzantine square fort, ca. 25 km south of the Dead Sea). The fort was built across the fault and the building that housed the water tank sustained the displacement.

Sentenced to death in 1948 under California's Little Lindbergh Law, Chessman became internationally famous for waging a legal battle to stay alive and fight his conviction and death sentence through voluminous appeals. Chessman became a cause c√©l√®bre for the movement to ban capital punishment. Before he was executed in 1960, he was the longest-lived death row inmate in history. Publishing history Chessman began writing his memoir after San Quentin Prison Warden Harley Teets told him he should do something with his life. Chessman wrote his autobiography, detailing his life in crime, with Teets's encouragement. The book was sold by literary agent Joseph Longstreth, who publicized the book, championing the condemned man's work. When it was published in 1954, the book became a best-seller and was made into a 1955 film of the same name. The great success caused Teets to attempt to prevent Chessman from additional writing.

Early life  Jumbe-Souli inherited the throne of the island of Moheli (Mwali) after the death of her father, King Ramanateka, also known as Sultan Abderahmane. Ramanateka was a Malagasy prince who ran away from Madagascar after the death of King Radama I. She was also a cousin of King Radama II. She had a sister, Jumbe-Salama, who died young. Her parents were Merina of Madagascar. Her father, General Ramanataka, was brother-in-law to Radama I, King of Madagascar. He died in 1842 and Djoumb√© ascended to the throne. Her mother, Ravao, ruled as regent for a time and married her husband's former adviser, Tsivandini, in 1843. He became Djoumb√©'s tutor and started making arrangements for her marriage to the sultan of Zanzibar.  Reign  When the missionary David Griffiths returned to Moheli in 1841, expecting to meet her father he in fact found his young daughter Jumbe-Souli on the throne. Jumbe-Souli, like the majority of people on the island was Muslim and did not convert to Christianity. Queen Jumbe-Souli receiving a French delegation in 1863 Ravao and Tsivandini divorced in 1846. Mayotte had recently been ceded to France, and the French, eager to develop their presence on Moh√©li, arranged for a Madame Droit to serve as governess for Djoumb√©. The French also arranged for her coronation at the age of 12, in 1849. Two years later she expelled the governess and married Sa√Ød Mohammed Nasser M'Kadar, who was cousin to Zanzibar's sultan. M'Kadar became prince consort and ruled with Fatima until 1860, when he was ousted by the French. Fatima held on to the throne, marrying two sultans. She renounced the throne for her son. In 1863, the French government sent a delegation to meet with Queen Jumbe-Souli and the event was recorded by a visiting photographer D√©sir√© Charnay. He recorded that she seemed \\"melancholy and sickly\\" and had a number of attendants. She was dressed extremely finely in a \\"robe of rich Turkish tissue of silk and gold\\". Her dress covered most of her face, with only her hand visible. The purpose of the visit had been to impress upon the young queen the advantages of becoming a French colony; she resisted. Jumbe-Souli lived in the palace, overlooking the sea, next to which was the garrison - a white building of two rooms, which held 28 soldiers. When the French returned in 1871, she was restored to the throne and ruled until her death in 1878.

Background Barsdell ran a dental practice, and employed Mr Barker as a dental technician there. When Barsdell later discovered that this employee had sexually assaulted some of his female patients there whilst they were under anaesthesia, Barsdell procured the victims silence through making payments of compensation to the victims husbands totaling $20,000. In return, Barker had given Barsdell a promissory note to reimburse him for these payments, stating \\"For valuable consideration received, I agree to pay the sum of twenty thousand dollars($20,000)to my very old friend and employer GLH Barsdell\\", and had used Mr Kerr, a solicitor, who was a visiting client, to witness the deed of gift. Barker at the same time changed his will, adding the provision to leave Barsdell $20,000 from his estate. However, Barker soon had a change of mind about paying the $20,000, and removed Barsdell from his will. An event which was rather untimely, as Barker soon died after this. To further complicate matters, Barsdell soon died as well, leaving his widow (and executrix of his estate) to try and collect on the note from Barkers estate, whom Kerr was named as the executor. Kerr refused to honour the note, as by now he had discovered the true nature of the transaction, claiming as it was contrary to public policy, thus legally unenforceable. Barsdell sought validation in the court for validation under the Illegal Contracts Act [1970] Held Validation for the promissory note was refused, as the consideration for the promissory note was illegal.

Unraced as a two-year-old, she won only one of her first eight races in 1978 and appeared to be some way inferior to the best horses of her generation. She then showed consistent improvement, winning her last four races of the season including the Sun Chariot Stakes and ended her year by decisively defeating a strong international field in the weight-for-age Champion Stakes. She remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to reproduce the form he had shown in the autumn of 1978. She made no impact as a broodmare. Background Swiss Maid was a strongly-built, dark-coated bay mare with no white markings bred by Mrs J R Hine. She was sired by Welsh Pageant, a one-mile specialist whose wins included the Lockinge Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Welsh Pageant's other progeny included the Arlington Million winner Teleprompter and the Ascot Gold Cup winner Longboat. Swiss Maid was the third foal of her dam, Hornton Grange, a half-sister to the dam of the Derby Italiano winner Don Orazio. As a yearling the filly was sold for 6000 guineas and was sent into training with Paul Kelleway at his Shalfleet stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=1978: three-year-old season= Swiss Maid was unraced as a two-year-old but was highly tried in the spring of her three-year old season. Her racecourse debut was scheduled for 19 April when she was to be matched against in the Wood Ditton Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse, but the filly refused to enter the starting stalls and was withdrawn. When she reappeared a few days later in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse she was equipped with a hood and finished fourth behind the subsequently disqualified Be Sweet. She was then moved up sharply in class for the 166th running of the 1000 Guineas over the same course and distance and finished unplaced behind Enstone Spark. Moved up in distance for the Group Three Musidora Stakes at York Racecourse in May the filly finished fourth behind the Barry Hills-trained Princess of Man. Later that month, Swiss Maid ran in the Lupe Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, which, like the Musidora Stakes, is a trial race for the Oaks Stakes. She finished second, four lengths behind the impressive winner Cistus. In June, Swiss Maid (now racing without a hood) was dropped in class and recorded her first victory, winning the Twyford Stakes over ten furlong at Newbury Racecourse. The filly was beaten in her next two races (including a poor effort when tried over one and a half miles in the Churchill Stakes at Royal Ascot) and was then dropped in distance for the Twickenham Stakes over seven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse and won from Spring In Deepsea, who was carrying ten pounds more than the winner. In the Virginia Stakes over ten furlongs at Newcastle Racecourse she won again, beating Sofala and Seraphima. Swiss Maid then appeared at Newmarket in early October when she ran in the ten furlong Sun Chariot Stakes, which was then a Group Two race. Ridden by Lester Piggott, she started at odds of 5/1 and recorded her most important success up to that time beating Be Sweet and Upper Deck by three quarters of a length and a length. Two weeks later, over the same course and distance, Swiss Maid moved up to Group One class for the weight-for-age Champion Stakes. With Piggott choosing to ride the favourite Hawaiian Sound (winner of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup) she was ridden by Greville Starkey and started at odds of 9/1 while the other major contenders included the French filly Dancing Maid (winner of the Prix Vermeille and third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) and the Eclipse Stakes winner Gunner B. Piggott sent Hawaiian Sound into the lead and set a strong pace ahead of Gunner B but Starkey moved Swiss Maid up to dispute the lead two furlongs from the finish and always looked the likely winner. She finished strongly and won by one and a half lengths from Hawaiian Sound, with Gunner B finishing third ahead of the French-trained colts Pevero and Pyjama Hunt. In December, Swiss Maid was offered for sale and bought back for 325,000 guineas. =1979: four- year-old season= Swiss Maid remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in nine races. At Royal Ascot in June she finished a close third behind Obraztsovy when attempting one and a half miles in the Hardwicke Stakes. She finished last in both the Eclipse Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, becoming very agitated in the starting stalls in the former race. By this time she had acquired a reputation for being a rather temperamental and \\"wayward\\" horse. At Goodwood in July she produced her best effort of the year when finishing second to Kris in the Sussex Stakes. After a respectable performance in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York in August, when she finished fourth behind Troy, she was unplaced in her last three races. At the end of the year, Swiss Maid returned to the sales: she was sold for 290,000 guineas and exported to the United States. Assessment In 1978, the independent Timeform organisation gave Swiss Maid a rating of 129, making her their top-rated three-year-old filly of the season. In the inaugural International Classification, a collaboration between the official handicappers of France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Swiss Maid was rated the best three-year-old filly in Europe ahead of Reine de Saba and Dancing Maid and the join-fifth best racehorse of any age behind Alleged, Ile de Bourbon, Acamas and Shirley Heights. In the following year, Swiss Maid was rated on 121 by Timeform while the International Classification rated her the best older female racehorse trained in Britain. Stud record Swiss Maid was sold in January 1988 to Allez France Stables for $120,000. Swiss Maid produced at least three foals between 1985 and 1992, none of whom were successful racehorses: *Swiss Sphere (chestnut filly, foaled in 1985, sired by Globe) *Sauvan (gelding, 1988, by Palace Music) *S√®vres (bay filly, 1992, sired by Lyphard's Wish) PedigreeReferences Category:1975 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-g ","title":"Swiss Maid"},{"id":"41558867","text":"Gryf coat of arms of the Mielecki family Mielecki (plural: Mieleccy, feminine form: Mielecka) was a family of knights, a branch of the Gryffin Clan.

Built in 1910, Heath Hall remained a residential property until the post-war period. After various owners it fell into dilapidation before being bought and renovated in recent years. Design Heath Hall was built in 1910 as East Weald, the London residence of William Park Lyle, son of sugar magnate Abram Lyle. English Heritage's listing for East Weald described it as \\"...one of the best houses in the Bishop's Avenue, a notable area of opulent suburban development, and embodies the affluent domestic taste of the Edwardian period.\\" Designed by Henry Victor Ashley and Winton Newman, their designs for East Weald were exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibitions of 1910 and 1911. The house is made from red brick with a green slate roof, built in an 'H' shape. The brick voussoirs within the \\"Romanesque-inspired arched hood\\" surrounding the front door of East Weald were particularly noted by English Heritage in their detailed description of the house. The architectural style of Heath Hall is influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and references Scottish Baronial architecture. It is 27,000 sq ft in size, located in 2.5 acres of grounds. It has 14 en-suite bedrooms. Amenities include indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a home cinema, and an internal leisure complex with a gym, steam room and sauna. Heath Hall also possesses a wine cellar with storage for more than 600 bottles. Security features include a panic room. History The Daily Telegraph visited Heath Hall in November 2011 with two elderly daughters of Louis Bolton, an underwriter at the insurance market Lloyd's, who had owned East Weald from 1923 to 1947. The women had lived at East Weald as children, and recalled that the present home cinema was a scullery during their time, and that the metal gates were commandeered during the Second World War. East Weald was sold by their father after the war for the same price that he had paid for it in 1923. It was a home for blind people before its purchase in the 1950s by the Bank of China to house its London employees. English Heritage designated it a Grade II listed building in November 2001. In 2006, it was bought by property developer Andreas Panayiotou for ¬£5 million; his subsequent seven year renovation cost an estimated ¬£40 million. Panayiotou renamed the house Heath Hall, and his renovation expanded the size of the house by a third. Heath Hall was placed on sale for ¬£100 million in 2012, with its asking price subsequently reduced by ¬£35 million to ¬£65 million in March 2013. In October 2016, Justin Bieber rented the 15-bedroom North London estate for ¬£108,000 a month, using it as his London home whilst performing in the UK.

The project was abandoned by the original developers following West's filing of a trademark infringement lawsuit against them. History=Release= Coinye was originally slated for release on January 11, 2014, but legal pressure prompted David P.

Early press materials promised a proper and fair release, with no pre-allocation of coins. However, later statements from the developers confirmed that approximately 0.37% of the maximum money supply of Coinye had been reserved for the creators of the coin before launch.

EuroVelo 5 (EV5), named the Via Romea Francigena, is a long EuroVelo long-distance cycling route running from Canterbury to Rome and ending at the Italian port of Brindisi. The route crosses Europe passing successively through six countries: UK, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, France again, Switzerland and Italy. The EV5 is named the Via Romea Francigena after the ancient road from France to Rome that passed over the high Alps: this is reflected in the old road's Latin name, Via Romea Francigena, which means \\"the way to Rome that comes from France\\". This route was notably documented by Archbishop of Canterbury, Sigeric the Serious who made the trip to Rome and back again in the 10th century. Note that there is also a walking trail called the Via Francigena which follows Sigeric's route from Canterbury to Rome more closely. It is important to realise that the EuroVelo route does not in any way follow the walking route; the two are very different. For instance, the Via Francigena walking trail does not pass through Belgium or Luxembourg. Route= In England= In England, the EV5 is complete. The route is long and follows the National Cycle Network route NCR1 from Canterbury to Dover. From the ancient city of Canterbury which was the historic starting point of Sigeric's Via Francigena, the EV5 then travels to the coast and the port of Sandwich and ends at Dover, where a ferry can take you to France to continue the ride. In England, the EV5 goes through Canterbury, Sandwich and Dover. = In France = , the EV5 in France is only complete in the eastern section. There are two sections of EV5 in France. One is in the north: it begins as it arrives from England at Calais before leaving France after Lille to head over the Belgian border towards Brussels. The second section is in the east of the country when the EV5 re-enters France from Luxembourg at Sarreguemine (next to Strasbourg) and makes its way to Basel, Switzerland. In the northern part of France, the EV5 goes through Calais (EV4), B√©thune, Lille and Roubaix. It then crosses the border into Belgium (see below). In the eastern part of France, the EV5 arrives from Luxembourg (see below) and passes through the provinces of Lorraine and Alsace. It follows a series of canals: * the Canal des houill√®res de la Sarre from Sarreguemines to Gondrexange * the Marne‚ÄìRhine Canal from Gondrexange to Strasbourg (EV15). * the old Canal de la Bruche from Strasbourg to Soultz-les-Bains * the Alsace Wine Route (V√©loroute du vignoble d'Alsace) from Soultz-les-Bains to Cernay * the route from the Ochsenfeld and Hardt : Battenheim, Baldersheim, Mulhouse, Kembs and Saint-Louis = In Belgium = , the EV5 in Belgium is partially complete. In Belgium, the EV5 follows the Flanders Cycle Route LF6 from the French border until just south of Brussels. After a ride through flat countryside, the EV5 goes through the hills of Haspengouw, Hageland and the Flemish Ardennes. From Namur to Dinant, it passes through the Meuse Valley and its steep cliffs before stumbling on small villages, pretty rivers and various forests of the green Wallonia before crossing into Luxembourg. In Belgium, the EV5 goes through Brussels, Namur (EV3) and Martelange. = In Luxembourg = , the EV5 in Luxembourg is still in development. In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the EV5 runs and follows a network of dedicated cycle paths from the Belgian border, through to its cliff-top capital city, and towards the French and German borders at Schengen. The EV5 follows the following national routes in Luxembourg: PC18, PC17, PC12, PC13, the Luxembourg-Ville route no. 10, PC1, PC11, PC7 and PC3. In Luxembourg, the EV5 goes through Strassen, Luxembourg, Hesperange and Schengen. It then passes through back to France (see above). = In Switzerland = In Switzerland, the EV5 is complete. It follows Swiss National Bike Route no. 3. From France, the EV5 goes through Basel (EV6, EV15), Jura Mountains, Aarau, Lucerne, Lake Lucerne, Andermatt (EV15), the Gotthard pass, Bellinzona, the Monte Ceneri Pass, Lake Lugano, Mendrisio and Chiasso. = In Italy = , the EV5 in Italy is largely incomplete. In Italy, the EV5 follows the BicItalia BI 3 Ciclovia dei Pellegrini cycle route passing through Rome and following a mainly inland route towards the west of the country before heading east to Brindisi. The route in Italy follows more closely the traditional route of the Via Francigena, a route which has recently been awarded EU funds to reinstate hostelry organisation and for route improvement. In Italy, the EV5 goes through Milan, Pavia, Fidenza, Piacenza (EV8) Parma, Berceto, Aulla, Florence (EV7), Siena, Bolsena, Rome (EV7), Fiuggi, Cassino, Benevento, Candela, Gravina in Puglia, Taranto and Brindisi.

The particles have a repulsive core and highly interactive surfaces that allow for this assembly. The placement of these patches on the surface of a particle promotes bonding with patches on other particles. Patchy particles are used as a shorthand for modelling anisotropic colloids, proteins and water and for designing approaches to nanoparticle synthesis. Patchy particles range in valency from two (Janus particles) or higher. Patchy particles of valency three or more experience liquid-liquid phase separation. Some phase diagrams of patchy particles do not follow the law of rectilinear diameters. Schematic depiction of modifying a spherical (e.g. colloidal) particle (center) to create a patchy particle, either by altering surface chemistry (left) or shape (right). Assembly of patchy particles=Simulations= The interaction between patchy particles can be described by a combination of two discontinous potentials. A hard sphere potential accounting for the repulsion between the cores of the particles and an attractive square potential for the attraction between the patches. With the interaction potential in hand one can use different methods to compute thermodynamic properties.  Molecular dynamics  Using a continuous representation of the discontinous potential described above enables the simulation of patchy particles using molecular dynamics.  Monte Carlo  One simulation done involves a Monte Carlo method, where the best ‚Äúmove‚Äù ensures equilibrium in the particle. One type of move is rototranslation. This is carried out by choosing a random particle, random angular and radial displacements, and a random axis of rotation. Rotational degrees of freedom need to be determined prior to the simulation. The particle is then rotated/moved according to these values. Also, the integration time step needs to be controlled because it will affect the resulting shape/size of the particle. Another simulation done is the grand-canonical ensemble. In the grand-canonical ensemble, the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath and reservoir of particles. Volume, temperature, and chemical potential are fixed. Because of these constants, a number of particles (n) changes. This is typically used to monitor phase behaviour. With these additional moves, the particle is added at a random orientation and random position. Other simulations involve biased Monte Carlo moves. One type is aggregation volume-bias moves. It consists of 2 moves; the first tries to form bond between two previously unbonded particles, the second tries to break an existing bond by separation. Aggregation volume-bias moves reflects the following procedure: two particles are chosen, I and J, which are not neighboring particles, particle J is moved inside the bonding volume of particle I. This process is carried out uniformly. Another aggregation volume- bias move follows a method of randomly choosing a particle J that is bonded to I. Particle J is then moved outside the bonding volume of particle I, resulting in the two particles no longer being bonded. A third type of aggregation volume-bias move takes a particle I bonded to particle J and inserts it into a third particle. Grand canonical ensemble is improved by aggregation volume-bias moves. When aggregation volume-bias moves are applied, the rate of monomer formation and depletion in enhanced and the grand- canonical ensemble moves increase. A second biased Monte Carlo simulation is virtual move Monte Carlo. This is a cluster move algorithm. It was made to improve relaxation times in strongly interacting, low density systems and to better approximate diffusive dynamics in the system. This simulation is good for self-assembling and polymeric systems that can find natural moves that relax the system. =Self-assembly= Self-assembly is also a method to create patchy particles. This method allows formation of complex structures like chains, sheets, rings, icosahedra, square pyramids, tetrahedra, and twisted staircase structures. By coating the surface of particles with highly anisotropic, highly directional, weakly interacting patches, the arrangement of the attractive patches can organize disordered particles into structures. The coating and the arrangement of the attractive patches is what contributes to the size, shape, and structure of the resulting particle. Emergent valence self-assembly Developing entropic patches that will self-assemble into simple cubic, body-centered cubic (bcc), diamond, and dodecagonal quasicrystal structures. The local coordination shell partially dictates the structure that is assembled. Spheres are simulated with cubic, octahedral, and tetrahedral faceting. This allows for entropic patches to self-assemble. Tetrahedral faceted spheres are targeted by beginning with simple spheres. In coordination with the faces of a tetrahedron, the sphere is sliced at four equal facets. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine different forms of Œ±, the faceting amount. The particular faceting amount determines the lattice that assembles. Simple cubic lattices are achieved in a similar way by slicing cubic facets into spheres. This allows for the assembly of simple cubic lattices. A bcc crystal is achieved by faceting a sphere octahedrally. The faceting amount, Œ±, is used in the emergent valence self-assembly to determine what crystal structure will form. A perfect sphere is set as Œ±=0. The shape that is faceted to the sphere is defined at Œ±=1. By fluctuating the faceting amount between Œ±=0 and Œ±=1, the lattice can change. Changes include effects on self-assembly, packing structure, amount of coordination of the faceting patch to the sphere, shape of the faceting patch, type of crystal lattice formed, and the strength of the entropic patch.

Definitely one of the most complete sets of metallurgical western Phoenician world, coming to complement the information, rather meager, of other Phoenician centers of the Mediterranean coast. The importance of this Guardamarenco site lies, first, on the existence in it of a huge fortification wall, a scarce element in the other Phoenician sites in the Iberian Peninsula. Second, remains of an ancient metallurgical activity have been found, demonstrating the special enclave of La Fonteta. And finally, on the high degree of conservation of archaeological remains because they were buried in fine sand. Among the material found there is a large repertoire of Phoenician typological pottery: vases, plates, red polished lamps. Note the appearance of archaic Greek pottery, and ritual objects such as ostrich eggs, ivory, scarabs, etc. The appearance of architectural elements reused in the wall, shows the existence of a temple or shrine in the environment.

It was originally located at the mouth of the Sele, about 9 kilometres north from the city of Paestum, then the Greek city of Poseidonia, which is famous for its three standing Greek temples. It is now in the modern commune of Capaccio- Paestum, some 50 miles south of Naples. The sanctuary is about 1.5 kilometres from the modern coast as a result of the deposition of alluvial sediment by the river. The complex was constructed from the 6th to at least the 3rd centuries BC, and included a Greek temple and other buildings. It was in the countryside, and may have included buildings to accommodate pilgrims. But in the Middle Ages most of the stones were removed for use as building materials or other purposes. After the best surviving pieces, including around 70 6th- century metope reliefs, were excavated and moved to the museum at Paestum, there is very little original to see at the site itself other than the lowest courses of the buildings. But a modern \\"museo narrante\\" has been built there with video displays to explain and reconstruct the site. Historical sources The existence of the sanctuary is reported by historic sources, but for a long time was not corroborated by other evidence. StraboStrabo, Geography. 6.1. , from the Perseus Project located the sanctuary of Argive Hera at the northern border of Lucania, on the left bank of the river Sele, about fifty stades from the city of Paestum and attributed its foundation to Jason during the expedition of the Argonauts. The same sanctuary is located on the other bank of the river by Pliny the Elder. These differing accounts made the rediscovery of the remains difficult. History Remains of an altar- platform The sanctuary was founded at the beginning of the sixth century BC by the Greek colony at Paestum, originally from further south at Sybaris, and dedicated to Argive Hera, the Greek goddess of women and marriage, as well as navigation. The Sele then represented a boundary between Greek and Etruscan areas of influence.Boardman, John ed., The Oxford History of Classical Art, p. 48, 1993, OUP, Initially cult activities must have been performed in the open, in a sacred area equipped with an altar and bounded by porticos for hosting pilgrims. At the end of the sixth century, a grand temple was built, which was probably octastyle (with a facade of eight columns) and peripteral. Two other buildings were built some distance in front of it at the same time. After the takeover of Paestum and the area by the local Lucanian people at the end of the fifth century BC, the sanctuary reached its highest peak, with the reuse of more ancient material for the construction of new buildings: a new portico and then a meeting house. At a certain distance a square building was also built, in which many loom weights have been found ‚Äì it is theorised that women about to be married would, during each year, help to weave a peplos dress for the cult statue which was offered to the goddess at an annual procession, in this building. A marble statue of Hera was also found there, seated on a throne with a pomegranate in her hand. In 273 BC, the area was absorbed by the Roman Republic, who turned Paestum into a colonia. The weaving building was destroyed and a wall was built around the sacred area. The sanctuary survived until the second century AD, in a slow decline, until the area silted up and eventually memory of the site was lost beyond the local area. The cult of Hera survived in Christianised form as the Madonna del Granato (Madonna of the Pomegranate), whose cult in the vicinity of the sanctuary recalls the depiction of Hera with the pomegranate. The sanctuary was brought to light by the excavations of the archaeologists Umberto Zanotti Bianco and Paola Zancani Montuoro between 1934 and 1940. Metopes Heracles kills Alcyoneus, in the earlier group of metopesAjax, in the earlier group of metopes, one of the sections only carved in outline. Around seventy metope reliefs carved in local sandstone have been recovered in excavations. They had been broken up, often into small fragments, and had to be pieced together like jigsaws. Thirty eight of these belong to a more ancient group (second half of the 6th century) and must have decorated buildings which cannot now be reconstructed. It was once thought they came from a rectangular building thought to be a treasury, but excavations demonstrated that this was built much too late for the style of the reliefs. The metopes of this group depict episodes from the Twelve Labours of Heracles, the Trojan War, and the lives of Jason and Orestes. The more recent group of around thirty metopes, from the main or second temple, depict young maidens dancing in bas-relief, reflecting the emphasis of the sanctuary cult on marriage. These date from around 510 BC. The earlier group were mostly carved in sections consisting of a triglyph on the left and a relief panel with figures on the right, all on a single piece of stone. In the second group each figure panel was a separate piece of stone. Some panels from both groups are very badly worn. The local stone is coarse and not suitable for carving detail. If only for this reason the figures in the reliefs are lightly modelled and relatively flat, but round their outlines the stone has been deeply cut back. Some have only the outline deeply carved, with the figures blank and flat. These may have been unfinished, or intended only to be painted.Hurwitt, Jeffrey M., The Art and Culture of Early Greece, 1100-480 B.C., p. 283, Internet Archive; Boardman, John ed., The Oxford History of Classical Art, p. 48, 1993, OUP, The muscularity of the figures is comparable to sculptures from Sybaris. All the reliefs were almost certainly brightly painted in colours. Though the three main Greek temples at Paestum are still standing, none of them had sculpted reliefs like these; perhaps painted scenes, now lost, substituted for them. According to Roland Martin, these thirty-eight metopes of the older period would have decorated a Treasury (Thesauros), with a rectangular floor plan and a Doric facade with two columns in antis. The capitals of the doric columns contrasted with the Ionic capitals of the antae. The doric frieze, which had no structural function, would have been placed in front of the wooden beams which supported the roof. The triglyphs, strongly projecting, like those of Temple C at Selinus, are the same size as the metopes. The indentations visible on the rear of the metopes show that they were inserted between the triglyphs after the installation of the wooden beams.Jean Charbonneaux; Roland Martin; Fran√ßois Villard, La Grecia arcaica : (620-480 a.C.), Milano, Rizzoli, 1969, pp. 189-190. However, excavations under the supposed treasury building now suggest that this was built much too late, and the intended home of the early group remains uncertain. It is now tending to be thought that they come from a postulated earlier temple on the site, referred to as \\"Hera I\\". The metopes are now in the Museo archeologico nazionale di Paestum, which was built in 1950 to house these discoveries and those from Paestum itself. Their arrangement in the museum represents the presumed structure of the \\"treasury\\" building which they were thought to have decorated. The identification of some subjects, and the extent to which the ensemble reflects a coherent programme, have continued to be discussed by scholars. Votive gifts The excavations of the sanctuary have also revealed a large number of votive gifts (mostly terracotta statuettes of the goddess), which were ritually buried at some point. A first deposit was found near the temple and was made up of five ditches lined by stone slabs and covered with stone as well. Some evidence of burning relates to the sacrifices offered at the time of the burial. The materials were deposited between the sixth and second centuries BC. The Museo Narrante del Santuario di Hera alla Foce del Sele A second large ditch was also discovered, containing around six thousand objects, including terracotta statues and little bronze objects, dating from between the fourth and second centuries BC, but with some coins from the second century AD which were deposited in a flood during the Roman Imperial period. A large portion of the votives are on display at the site of the sanctuary in the Museo Narrante del Santuario di Hera alla Foce del Sele, located in a reconstructed farm house (the masseria Procuriali).

Having been admitted to the state bar of Tennessee in 1897, she also practiced law in Topeka, Kansas and Brooklyn, New York. In 1898, she joined the faculty of the law school of her alma mater, Central Tennessee College of Law becoming the first woman to teach law in a chartered law school.http://wlh.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cunnea- timeline.pdf  Early life  Lutie A. Lytle was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, one of six surviving children of John R. and Mary Ann \\"Mollie\\" (Chesebro) Lytle, both former slaves. In 1882, the Lytle family moved to Topeka, Kansas, most likely as a result of the mass migration of African- Americans from the South to the American West due to the Exoduster movement. John Lytle worked in a number of jobs, but mostly as a barber, operating his own shop with the help of his son Charles Clayton Lytle.1900 Federal Census for Shawnee County (Kansas) Enumeration District 154, Sheet 5-A, Lines 38-43 Both John and Charles Lytle also became active in local politics as members of the Populist Party; John Lytle at one time ran for the position of Topeka city jailor. Charles Lytle would become a Topeka policeman, rising to the rank of Chief of Detectives. He later served as a field deputy in the Kansas State Fire Marshal's Office and as a Deputy Sheriff of Shawnee County, Kansas as well as owning a drug store in Topeka.Information taken from the Topeka Colored Directory of 1928, found online at http://genealogytrails.com/kan/shawnee/bios5.html  Education and admission to the Bar  Lutie Lytle attended local Topeka schools and graduated from Topeka High School, where she was described as an \\"apt pupil.\\" A contemporary account states that John Lytle, \\"an ardent worker in politics,\\" while not asking for any favors for himself, \\"began to direct his influence toward obtaining something good for her.\\" When the Populist Party swept into power in Kansas in 1891,\\"Populism,\\" Kansaspedia, http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/populism/15160 sixteen-year-old Lutie Lytle was appointed assistant enrolling clerk for the Kansas Populist-controlled legislature, a \\"position she filled with eminent satisfaction to all concerned.\\" \\"Only Woman Lawyer In The State of Tennessee is Lutie Lytle, Colored.

As she said later, \\"I read the newspaper exchanges a great deal and became impressed with the knowledge of the fact that my own people especially were the victims of legal ignorance. I resolved to fathom its depths and penetrate its mysteries and intricacies in hopes of being a benefit to my people.\\"\\"Lutie Lytle,\\" Kansaspedia http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/lutie-lytle/12136 Saving a portion of her earnings, Lutie went to Chattanooga, Tennessee where she taught school. She subsequently enrolled at the \\"law course\\" of Central Tennessee College in Nashville, Tennessee where, in 1897, she graduated as valedictorian. \\"Besides the certificate of graduation the young woman was furnished with a diploma licensing her to practice before any of the courts in Tennessee.\\" Lutie Lytle was able to secure a required certification of \\"good moral character\\" and her name was \\"enrolled on the minutes of... the Criminal Court [of Nashville].\\".\\"Only Woman Lawyer\\" Upon her admission, Lytle became the first female admitted to the Tennessee State Bar. In September 1897, Lutie returned to Topeka where she became the first African American woman admitted to practice law in the state of Kansas. Although contemporary reports describe Lutie Lytle as being the first black woman lawyer in the United States, it appears that she was probably the third, being preceded by Charlotte E. Ray and Mary Ann Shadd Cary. However, at the time of Lytle's admission to the Tennessee and Kansas state bars, Ray had left the practice of law and Shadd Cary had died. However, it is probably accurate that, as her local paper reported, that she was \\"the first colored woman appointed to the bar in the West.\\" \\"Good Advice,\\" (Topeka) Daily Capital, March 23, 1902, 16  Teaching law  After returning home to Topeka, it had been Lutie Lytle's intention to \\"commence practicing right away, but I found that a rest was what I needed.\\" In 1898, she returned to Central Tennessee College as a member of the law school faculty and a librarian. The press claimed she was the first woman law professor in the United States, but others have noted Lytle began teaching at the same time as the female founders of the Washington College of Law. She stayed for one session through the spring of 1899.Lutie Lytle,\\" Kansaspedia http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/lutie-lytle/12136 Since Lytle entered the educational field rather than practice law while in Tennessee, Marion Griffin was credited as the state's first female lawyer in 1907.

Although his office was in Manhattan, the couple lived in a two story brownstone at 16 Downing Street in Brooklyn, New York. There were no children. Alfred Cowan was active in political, social and cultural circles, and his wife, who was described in the local press as \\"the only colored lady lawyer in New York,\\" was just as active. She gave talks before women's groups and church congregations, as well as participating in programs designed to help the plight of black women in America, including the National Association of Colored Women. She also entertained many distinguished members of the African American professional, religious and intellectual communities, and their attendance was duly recorded in the black press.For an example, see \\"Mrs. Cowan Entertains For Visitors.\\" (New York) Age, September 9, 1915, 9 As an example, in 1911, the editor of a \\"small colored [news]paper\\" ill-advisedly editorialized that \\"the colored women of New York City were mainly responsible for the immoral conditions of the city.\\" Lutie Lytle-Cowan, the president of the Women's Civic Alliance \\"led the protest against the uncalled attack on the womanhood of the city.\\" After the editor attempted to defend himself and his writings, \\"... Mrs. Cowan expressed a desire that he remain until he had heard a few words on the subject by some of the women present. Mrs. Cowan declared that while it was true that some women conducted buffet flats [another name for houses of ill repute] it was also true that such places were opened and maintained at the behest and patronage of men; that when women stood on street corners and talked with members of the male sex it was done at the instance of men, and that men were usually responsible for the moral status of women. It was suggested that the men of the city set a higher standard for the men to go by and not work to drag them down, thereby improving conditions.\\"\\"Attacked Womanhood.

Jean-Claude Beton (January 14, 1925 ‚Äì December 2, 2013) was an Algerian-born French businessman, agricultural engineer and entrepreneur. Beton was the founder of the French soft drink maker, Orangina. He is credited with transforming Orangina from a little known citrus soda first manufactured by his father, L√©on Beton, into a major global brand. Beton launched Orangina's iconic, signature 8-ounce bottle in 1951, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle is shaped like an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit. In 2009, Beton called Orangina the \\"champagne of soft drinks,\\" saying that \\"It doesn't contain added colorants. It was and still is slightly sparkling. It had a little bulby bottle.\\" Biography=Early life and origins of Orangina= Beton was born in Boufarik, French Algeria, on January 14, 1925. In 1935, his father, L√©on Beton, a Pied-Noir shopkeeper, acquired the recipe for citrus concentrate, then called Naranjina, (that would become Orangina) from its inventor, a Spanish pharmacist named Dr. Trigo. The original recipe contained a mix of citrus juices and sugar. L√©on Beton tinkered with Trigo's formula, adding sparkling water and new essential flavoring oils. L√©on also renamed the new drink from Naranjina to Orangina. The outbreak of World War II largely sidelined L√©on Beton's attempts to market his drink in Europe. =Orangina= L√©on's son, Jean-Claude Beton, took over the company from his father in 1947. However, Beton did not relaunch Orangina until January 23, 1951, which happened to be his wife, Madeleine's, birthday. On that date, Beton began producing Orangina using orange from the surrounding groves in Boufarik. Jean- Claude Beton largely kept most of the original recipe, which he marketed to appeal in European and North African consumers. He opened a family-owned factory, which was located in his native Boufarik on the Mitidja Plain. Orangina quickly became a common beverage throughout French North Africa, including a loyal following among French soldiers during the Algerian War. He introduced the soda to metropolitan France later in 1951. In 1951, Jean-Claude Beton introduced Orangina's iconic, signature 8-ounce bottle, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle is shaped like an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit. Beton, who excelled in marketing, insisted that the shape, design and shape of the bottle remained the same, even after some resistance from restaurants and retail stores, who argued that the bottles were difficult to stock on shelves. In a 2009 interview, Beton noted that, \\"I got lots of complaints from caf√© owners who could not fit the bottle in their fridges.\\" Besides the obvious similarities to an orange, Beton also described the bottle as having \\"a waist like a wasp and the bottom of a princess.\\" He also refused to change Orangina's formula, which includes citrus pulp, despite appeals from shop owners. Beton later used television commercials to instruct consumers to shake the bottle before drinking. The early Orangina logo was designed to include an orange peel, since under French law, Orangina could not use a full orange in its logo since the beverage contained a low percentage of fruit juice. Beton hired illustrator Bernard Villemot, who had created Art Deco poster advertisements for such French companies as Perrier and Air France. Villemot created the image of an Orangina bottle topped with an orange peel in the shape of an umbrella or parasol. He utilized an orange color design against a blue background, which called to mind the Mediterranean Sea, to comply with the French standards, while still depicting parts of the citrus fruit. Villemot's and Beton's design quickly became associated with post-war French success. The image proved successful and Orangina sold 50 million bottles in 1957 alone. Beton moved his family's Orangina factory from Boufarik to Marseille in 1962 in the aftermath of the Algerian War, shortly before the North African country's independence. He continued to market Orangina extensively after the company's relocation. In 1978, Orangina was launched in the United States under the brand name, Orelia, which was later changed back to Orangina. In 1986, after he sold the company, a 75-foot sculpture of an Orangina bottle was installed outside Porte Maillot m√©tro station in Paris to mark the drink's fiftieth anniversary. =Later life= Jean-Claude Beton sold Orangina to Pernod Ricard in 1984, with Thierry Jacquillat for Pernod Ricard being a prominent character in regards to the purchase happening. He remained chairman of Orangina until his retirement in 1989. The brand went through a series of different owners throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1997, The Coca- Cola Company offered 5 billion francs for Orangina, but the acquisition was nixed by the French government, which cited the potential for unfair competition within the country's beverage market. A second attempt by Coca- Cola to purchase Orangina in 1998 also failed. Orangina, known officially as Orangina Schweppes, is now owned a division of Suntory, as of 2014. Orangina was not produced again in Algeria until 2003, when a new factory was opened by a franchise. Beton returned to Algeria for the first time since 1967 to attend the opening. He also visited the site of his original factory in Boufarik. Beton pursued other interests after the 1984 sale of Orangina, including olive oil and wine. He purchased several olive groves, as well as the Ch√¢teau Grand Ormeaux winery in Bordeaux during the 1980s. Jean-Claude Beton died in Marseille on December 2, 2013, at the age of 88. His death was disclosed by the Mayor of Marseille, Jean-Claude Gaudin. He was survived by his wife, Madelaine, and their two children, Eric and Fran√ßoise.

Located approximately distant, the star is a hot blue giant of spectral type O7.5IIIn((f)), a massive star that is likely currently expanding to become a supergiant. The star is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula (likely a Str√∂mgren sphere) named S 119. 68 Cygni is currently classified as a rotating ellipsoidal variable, varying between apparent magnitudes 4.98 and 5.09, although the classification as a rotating ellipsoidal variable is subject to controversy. Barely visible to the naked eye, the star is likely to have a mass of around 26 solar masses and a temperature of approximately 34,000 kelvins, although many of the star's physical parameters are subject to uncertainties due to the unclear nature of the system.  Naming  Being visible to the naked eye, 68 Cygni would have been observable since ancient times, but the first known cataloging and designation of the star was by Johann Bayer, who assigned it the Bayer designation A Cygni. Bayer grouped stars into six magnitude groupings (1st- through 6th-magnitude) and assigned Greek letters to the brightest 24 stars in these groupings, sorted by right ascension within groups. When he ran out of Greek letters, Bayer then moved on to Latin letters; thus, 68 Cygni was the 25th star Bayer designated in Cygnus. The star was later observed by John Flamsteed, who cataloged naked-eye stars by constellation. Contrary to popular belief, Flamsteed did not assign the stars Flamsteed designations; rather, the French astronomer Joseph J√©r√¥me de Lalande assigned Flamsteed numbers to stars in each constellation in order of right ascension. Since this star was the 68th star by right ascention in Cygnus, it was numbered 68 Cygni, the designation by which this star is most commonly known today, as most Latin-letter Bayer designations are no longer in common use. After the star was discovered to be variable, it was assigned a variable star designation. As the 1809th variable star without a Bayer designation to be discovered in Cygnus, 68 Cygni was assigned the designation V1809 Cygni in 1984.  Observation  68 Cygni has an apparent magnitude of approximately 5.0, making the star a fairly inconspicuous star in the night sky, and nearly invisible when the moon is full. With a new moon, according to the Bortle scale, the star cannot be easily seen with the naked eye from polluted areas or with a full moon, but can be seen from suburban areas when overhead. In the night sky, 68 Cygni is located west of the main asterism of Cygnus, approximately seven degrees east-southeast of the first-magnitude star Deneb. This is near the midpoint of the imaginary line between the 3rd- magnitude stars Xi Cygni and Rho Cygni. The star can also be found by continuing north along the line between the stars Zeta Cygni, Upsilon Cygni, Tau Cygni, and Sigma Cygni, as 68 Cygni is the first easily visible naked-eye star one will come to.  Properties  According to the star's measured parallax of 0.70 milliarcseconds, it is located approximately distant, although such low parallax values are subject to low precision. With taking into account the error estimate of 0.23 milliarcseconds, the star's distance could be anywhere between and distant, although values close to the mean value are more likely. 68 Cygni is a massive blue giant of spectral type O7.5IIIn((f)). Such massive stars only remain in the main sequence phase for a few million years, less than a thousandth of the expected main sequence lifetime of the sun. 68 Cygni has already expanded off the main sequence to become a blue giant, and is likely expanding to become a blue supergiant, although for very hot stars such as 68 Cygni evolution to the giant and supergiant classes does not indicate exhaustion of core hydrogen, nor is it accompanied by a large increase in luminosity. Instead the products of fusion burning are distributed throughout the star by convection and rotational mixing, producing helium and nitrogen lines in the spectrum, leading to an increase in the thickness of the stellar wind, and accompanied by a modest expansion and cooling of the star. The \\"n\\" in the spectral type indicates the presence of broad absorption lines due to how rapidly the star is spinning. The \\"((f))\\" indicates strong absorption in the He II spectral lines and weak N III emission lines. The star is currently tentatively classified as a rotating ellipsoidal variable, varying between magnitudes 4.98 and 5.09. Rotating ellipsoidal variables are binary systems in which the constituent components are distorted into ellipses due to fast rotation rates, and as the two stars orbit each other, the surface area of the star facing Earth changes, causing variations in brightness. However, the actual cause of the variability, and even whether or not there is a companion, is uncertain. No companion has ever been directly detected, but its existence has been inferred from spectral line variations in the primary O-type star. A period of 5.1 days has been assigned for the orbit of the binary, which is approximately the same as the rotation period of the star. Unlike typical rotating ellipsoidal variables, there is no clearly defined period in the variations in brightness. Data derived from the assumption of a binary system, for example the mass, are highly uncertain due to the lack of information about the inclination or eccentricity of the orbit, or even whether there is a companion. The spectral lines of 68 Cygni vary erratically, but possibly with a period around 5 days. The lines frequently show P Cygni profiles with both an absorption and emission component slightly offset due to doppler shifting. The emission component arises primarily in the stellar wind and the absorption component in the photosphere. The emission components of the spectral lines are largely constant, but the absorption components vary, leading to changes in the line profiles. This is strongest in the ultra violet part of the electromagnetic spectrum and has been extensively studied by the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite. The type and scale of the spectroscopic variations indicates large-scale structures within the stellar wind. 68 Cygni is known to be surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula, named S 119. Although it was originally proposed that this nebula was formed from 68 Cygni's stellar wind, it now appears that the nebula is simply a Str√∂mgren sphere that is being ionized by 68 Cygni. Instead, the stellar wind is likely, due to the star's high velocity through space, forming a bow shock. The mass of the star is likely to be around 26 solar masses, according to a 2011 study by Ducati, Penteado, and Turcati. However, due to the uncertain nature of the binary system hypothesis, the true mass could be much different than this. If the star actually has a mass of 51 solar masses (the median mass reported by Hohle, Neuh√§user, and Schutz in 2010), the star's bolometric luminosity would be over 1 million solar luminosities, making it among the most luminous stars known, although data to support this mass is tenuous at best.

It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats: the 33 rpm long-playing record (LP), the audiocassette, and the music compact disc. Rock musicians were often at the forefront of the era, which is sometimes called the album-rock era in reference to their sphere of influence and activity. LP albums developed in the early 20th century and were originally marketed for classical music and wealthier adult consumers, while singles dominated the music industry, eventually through the success of rock and roll performers in the 1950s. It was not until the mid 1960s, when the Beatles began to release artistically ambitious and top-selling LPs, that more rock acts followed suit and the industry embraced pop albums to immense success while burgeoning rock critics validated their cultural value. By the 1970s, the LP had emerged as a fundamental artistic unit and a widely popular item with young people, often marketed using the idea of a concept album. At the end of the 1970s, LP albums experienced a decline in sales while the singles format was reemphasized by the developments of punk rock, disco, and MTV's music video programming. The record industry combated this trend by gradually displacing LPs with CDs, releasing fewer singles that were hits to force sales of their accompanying albums, and inflating the prices of CD albums in the 1990s, when their production proliferated. However, by the end of the decade, file sharing networks such as Napster undermined the format's viability, as consumers were able to rip and share CD tracks digitally over the Internet. In the early 21st century, music downloading and streaming services emerged as popular means of distribution, as album sales more than halved and recording acts generally focused on singles, effectively ending the album era. However, at the end of the 2010s, concept albums reemerged with culturally-relevant and critically successful personal narratives, while high- profile pop acts continued to market their album releases seriously. Pre- history An LP record on a phonograph Technological developments in the early 20th century led to sweeping changes in the way recorded music was made and sold. Prior to the LP, the standard medium for recorded music had been the 78 rpm gramophone record, made from shellac and featuring a three-to-five minute capacity per side. The capacity limitations placed constraints on the composing processes of recording artists, while the fragility of shellac prompted the packaging of these records in empty booklets resembling photo albums, with typically brown-colored wrapping paper as covers. The introduction of polyvinyl chloride in record production led to vinyl records, which played with less noise and more durability. In the 1940s, the market for commercial- and home-use recordings was dominated by the competing RCA Victor and Columbia Records, whose chief engineer Peter Carl Goldmark pioneered the development of the 12-inch long play (LP) vinyl record. This format could hold recordings as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side, at a speed of 33 1‚ÅÑ3 rpm, and was playable with a small-tipped \\"microgroove\\" stylus designed for home playback systems. Officially introduced in 1948 by Columbia, LPs became known as \\"record albums\\", termed in reference to the photo album-like 78 packaging. Another innovation from Columbia was the addition of graphic and typographic design to album jacket covers, introduced by Alex Steinweiss, the label's art director. Encouraged by its positive effect on LP sales, the music industry adopted illustrated album covers as a standard by the 1950s. Originally, the album was primarily marketed for classical music listeners. Musical film soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as Frank Sinatra quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45 rpm seven-inch single sales were considered the primary market for the music industry, while albums were a secondary market. The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as Elvis Presley were driven primarily by single sales.  1960s: Beginnings of the era  According to music critic Ann Powers, the arrival of the Beatles in the United States in 1964 \\"set in motion what can be called the 'classic album era'\\". In his Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture, Marcel Danesi comments that \\"the album became a key aspect of the countercultural movement of the 1960s, with its musical, aesthetic, and political themes. From this, the 'concept album' emerged, with the era being called the 'album era'\\". He lists the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965) as one of the first of the era's \\"concept albums\\". Music historian Bill Martin cites the release of Rubber Soul in December 1965 as the \\"turning point\\" for pop music, in that for the first time \\"the album rather than the song became the basic unit of artistic production.\\" Author David Howard agrees, saying that \\"pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere\\" by Rubber Soul and \\"Suddenly, it was more about making a great album without filler than a great single.\\" In January 1966, Billboard magazine referred to the opening sales of Rubber Soul in the US (1.2 million copies over nine days) as proof of teenage record-buyers gravitating towards the LP format. While it was in keeping with the industry norm in the UK, the lack of a hit single on Rubber Soul added to the album's identity in the US as a self- contained artistic statement. The Beatles in 1964; several of their 1960s studio albums have been credited by music historians for heralding the album era. Following the Beatles' example, several rock albums intended as artistic statements were released in 1966, including the Rolling Stones' Aftermath, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, the Beatles' own Revolver and the Who's A Quick One. Music journalist Mat Snow cites these five releases, together with Otis Redding's 1965 LP Otis Blue, as evidence that \\"the album era was here, and though hit singles still mattered, they were no longer pop's most important money spinners and artistic statements.\\" According to Jon Pareles, the music industry profited immensely and redefined its economic identity because of the era's rock musicians, who \\"started to see themselves as something more than suppliers of ephemeral hit singles\\". In the case of the British music industry, the commercial success of Rubber Soul and Aftermath foiled attempts to re-establish the LP market as the domain of wealthier, adult record-buyers. From early 1966, record companies there ceased their policy of promoting adult-oriented entertainers over rock acts, and embraced budget albums for their lower-selling artists to cater to the increased demand for LPs. The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is identified by Rolling Stone assistant editor Andy Greene as marking \\"the beginning of the album era\\", a reference echoed by Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork; Greene adds that \\"it was the big bang of albums\\".Chris Kokenes. \\"'A Day in the Life' Lyrics to be Auctioned.\\" CNN.com. April 30, 2010. Retrieved January 5, 2014. Chuck Eddy refers to the \\"high album era\\" as beginning with Sgt. Pepper. Its release in May 1967 coincided with the emergence of dedicated rock criticism in the US and intellectuals seeking to position pop albums as valid cultural works. Music historian Simon Philo writes that, aside from the level of critical acclaim it received, \\"the record's [commercial] success ushered in the era of album-oriented rock, radically reshaping how pop music worked economically.\\" Reinforcing its creative ambition, Sgt. Pepper was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with a lyric sheet, typifying a trend whereby musicians now commissioned associates from the art world to design their LP sleeves, and presented their albums to the record company for release. Greg Kot said Sgt. Pepper introduced a template for both producing album-oriented rock and consuming it, \\"with listeners no longer twisting the night away to an assortment of three-minute singles, but losing themselves in a succession of 20-minute album sides, taking a journey led by the artist.\\" In addition to Sgt. Pepper, Danesi cites the Beatles' 1968 White Album as part of the era's emergence. Dave Marsh has called Jimi Hendrix's \\"Purple Haze\\" (1967) the \\"debut single of the Album Rock Era\\".Dave Marsh. Review of \\"Purple Haze\\" in The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. Dave Marsh. Da Capo Press, 1999. p. 178. Neil Strauss refers to the \\"album-rock era\\" as beginning in the late 1960s and ultimately encompassing LP records by both rock and non-rock artists.  1970s: Golden age of the LP  The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the \\"golden era\\" of the album. According to BBC Four's When Albums Ruled the World (2013), \\"These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood.\\" \\"The album era had ushered in the notion of the rock singer as an artist who is worth paying attention to for more than the length of a hit\\", Pareles later observed. \\"Performers could become vivid presences to their fans even when they weren't ubiquitous on the Top 40, and loyalties were formed that continue[d] to the [1990s] for some performers of the 1960s and 1970s, from the Kinks to Michael Jackson to Sting.\\" Marc Hogan of Pitchfork comments that female musicians and African Americans were rarely included in what became a predominantly white-male \\"rock-stuffed canon\\" during the album era, with exceptions being records by Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, among others. The 1970 Joni Mitchell LP Ladies of the Canyon is commonly regarded as one of the album era's most important records. The productions of Bob Ezrin ‚Äì who worked on 1970s albums by Alice Cooper and Kiss' Destroyer (1976) ‚Äì are also highlighted from this era. As music journalist James Campion writes, \\"The 1970s album era was perfectly suited to his cinematic approach. Its format, with its two sides, as if two acts in a play with an intermission, allows for a crucial arc in the storytelling.\\" Along with the LP record, the 8-track tape was another format popular in the US in this period. Elaborating on the 1970s LP aesthetic, Campion identifies cultural and environmental factors that, in his mind, made the format ideal for young people during the decade. He describes the \\"solitary ambience\\" offered to listeners by the turntable and headphones, which \\"enveloped [them] in intricate stereo panning, atmospheric sounds, and multilayered vocal trickery\\". The popularity of recreational drugs and mood lamps at the time provided further settings for more focused listening experiences: \\"This kept the listener rapt to each song: how one flowed into the other, their connecting lyrical content, and the melding of instrumentation.\\" A Rhodes College student listening to the 1969 Yes LP on campus, c. 1970 In comparison to future generations, Campion explains that people growing up in the 1970s found greater value in album listening, in part because of their limited access to any other home entertainment appliance: \\"Many of them were unable to control the family television or even the kitchen radio. This led to prioritizing of the bedroom or upstairs den: the imagination capsule, locked away inside the headphone dreamscape, studying every corner of the 12-inch artwork and delving deeper into lyrical subtext, whether in ways intended by the artist or not. As if sitting in their own theater of the mind ‚Äì already hijacked by comic-book fantasy images of horror and science fiction, advertising propaganda, and the American promise of grandeur ‚Äì they were willing participants in the playful meandering of their rock-and-roll heroes.\\" Adding to this observation, Pareles says, \\"Pop stars develop staying power when listeners' affection and fascination is transferred from a hit song, or a string of hits, to the singer. Successive songs become a kind of narrative, held together by the image of and fantasies about the performer.\\" According to Hogan, with Sgt. Pepper having provided the impetus, the idea of a \\"concept album\\" became a marketing tool by the 1970s, as \\"no shortage of bands used the pretense of 'art' to sell tens of millions of records.\\" Citing hugely successful albums like Pink Floyd's 1973 LP The Dark Side of the Moon, Hogan says \\"record sales spiraled upward until 1977, when they began ticking downward.\\" This decline is attributed by Pareles to the developments of punk rock and disco in the late 1970s: \\"Punk returned the focus to the short and noisy song. Disco concentrated on the physical moment when a song makes a body move.\\" Robert Christgau similarly said, \\"the singles aesthetic began to reassert itself with disco and punk\\", suggesting this ended the \\"High Album Era\\". In a different analysis, historian Matthew Restall observed in this period popular acts struggling to sustain the high level of success afforded to their previous albums. Citing the disappointing receptions of Elton John's Blue Moves (1976) and Fleetwood Mac's Tusk (1979), Restall said, \\"[These] are dramatic examples of how the recording artists of the great album era ... suffered the receiving end of a horizon of expectations.\\"  1980s‚Äì1990s: Competing formats, transition to CD  The fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s marked the end of the LP-driven \\"golden age\\". The success of MTV's music video programming also reemphasized the single format in the 1980s and early 1990s. According to Pareles, it soon became apparent that, \\"after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool\\" and influenced record buyers' consuming habits toward more \\"disposable hits\\". Dependent on outlets like MTV that exclusively played hit songs, record companies placed more pressure on recording acts to achieve instant commercial success and marketability. \\"The 1980s and 1990 brought record sales to new peaks while the performers themselves tended to flash and burn out\\", Pareles wrote.Jon Pareles. \\"Pop View: As MTV Turns 10, Pop Goes the World.\\" The New York Times.

Hogan cites Prince, Kate Bush, and Public Enemy ‚Äì all of whom emerged during this period ‚Äì as further exceptions in the predominantly white-male \\"rock-stuffed canon\\" of the album era. The album format eventually consolidated its domination of the recorded music market, first with the brief emergence of the cassette. According to PC Mag columnist John C. Dvorak, \\"the album era had resulted in too many albums with only one good song on each of them, so cassettes let users do their own mixes\\", a trend expedited by the introduction of the Sony Walkman in 1979. The introduction of the CD, along with the portable Discman player in 1984, effectively displaced the cassette and began the displacement of LPs in the 1980s as the standard album format for the music industry. As LPs fell out of favor to CDs, hip hop producers repurposed them as sampling sources, contributing to the development of record collecting. In the transition to CDs, well-regarded albums of the past were reissued on the format by their original record labels, or the label to whom the album's ownership had been transferred in the event of the original's closure, for instance. However, many LPs were overlooked for digital rerelease \\"because of legal and contractual problems, as well as simple oversight\\", Strauss explains. Instead, such records were often rediscovered and collected through the crate digging practices of North American hip hop producers seeking rare sounds to sample for their own recordings. In her account of the 1980s hip hop crate-diggers, media and culture theorist Elodie A. Roy writes, \\"As they trailed second-hand shops and car boot sales ‚Äì depositories of unwanted capitalist surplus ‚Äì diggers were bound to encounter realms of mainstream, mass-produced LP records now fallen out of grace and fashion.\\" This development also contributed to the phenomenon of the \\"popular collector\\", which material culture scholar Paul Martin describes as those generally interested in \\"obtainable, affordable and appealing\\" items ‚Äì such as music releases ‚Äì and attributes to mass production. According to Pareles, after \\"the individual song returned as the pop unit\\" through the 1980s, record companies at the end of the decade began to abstain from releasing hit singles as a means of pressuring consumers to purchase the album on which the single featured. By the end of the 1980s, seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and almost entirely displaced by cassette singles, neither of which ultimately sold as well as albums. By the mid-1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the US. In 1998, Billboard magazine ended the requirement of a physical single for charting on its Hot 100 chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. Album production proliferated in the 1990s, with Christgau approximating 35,000 albums worldwide were released each year during the decade. The release of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) is cited by Eddy as roughly the end of the \\"high album era\\", although Strauss writes in 1995 that the \\"album-rock era\\" is still in effect. Kot, however, observed a decline in integrity among the industry and artists. He suggested that consumers had been exploited through the decade by increasing prices of CD albums, which are less expensive to produce than vinyl records, and longer run-times with considerably lower-quality music. While acknowledging some recording acts still attempt to abide by ideals from the album era, he said most have renounced their responsibilities as artists and storytellers and embraced indulgent recording practices in order to profit from the CD boom. 2000s: Decline in the digital age In 1999, Kot published a faux obituary for the 33 rpm LP form in the Chicago Tribune. In it, he argued that the LP had \\"been made obsolete by MP3 downloads, movie soundtracks and CD shufflers ‚Äì not to mention video games, cable television, the Internet and the worldwide explosion of media that prey upon the attention spans of what used to be known as album buyers.\\" That same year, the Internet peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster allowed Internet users to easily download single songs in MP3 format, which had been ripped from the digital files located on CDs. By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide. Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, several other music download services took its place. In 2001, Apple Inc.'s iTunes service was introduced and the iPod, a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year. This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats. By 2006, CD sales were outnumbered for the first time by digital single downloads, with digital music consumers buying singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.Jeff Leeds. \\"The Album, a Commodity in Disfavor.\\" The New York Times. March 26, 2007. Retrieved January 5, 2014. By 2009, album sales had more than halved since 1999, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry. An HMV record shop in Wakefield, England closing its operation in March 2013 With the rise of digital media in the 2000s, the \\"popular collector\\" of physical albums had transitioned to the \\"digital\\" and \\"electronic\\" collector. Of such collectors, Roy says it can be argued they are \\"not equipped with sufficient archiving knowledge or tools to preserve his/her collection in the long run\\", citing the vulnerable shelf life of digital files. Concurrently, the demise of physical music stores allowed for websites to emerge as domains for album collecting, including the music review database AllMusic, the streaming service Spotify, and Discogs, which began as a music database before developing into an online marketplace for physical music releases. The phrase \\"death of the album\\" was used in the media during the decline, usually attributing it to Internet sharing and downloading,* and the changing expectations of music listeners. Capitol-EMI's COO Jeff Kempler said in 2007 that less artists will pursue album-oriented campaigns, while media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted the album's death with consumers listening to playlists on their MP3 players instead. In a 2014 interview, Lee Phillips of the Californian entertainment law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips believed the album era had ended and blamed record companies for failing to recognize the inevitability of streaming as the favored means of music distribution and for not working with Napster on a solution. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).  2010s‚Äìpresent: Post-album era  Music writers in the 2010s, such as Jon Caramanica and Kevin Whitehead, have described this period in the album's history as the \\"post-album era\\". By the latter part of the decade, record labels had generally invested in streaming platforms such as Spotify and Pandora Radio, with strategies focused on curated playlists and individual tracks rather than albums. According to Deseret News writer Court Mann in 2019, \\"services like Spotify and Apple Music have moved our [music] libraries off personal hard drives, iPods and CDs, and into the cloud. Our music is decreasingly self-contained and private.\\" With consumers abandoning albums, more performers focused on releasing singles, a trend which critics felt undermined their artistic potential and produced many one-hit wonders.Tejas Morey. \\"How iTunes Changed The Music Industry Forever.\\" MensXP (Times of India). Retrieved January 5, 2014. A smartphone displaying playlists on Spotify, 2010. The streaming service became a dominant and redefining platform for music consumption during the decade. Other critics still believe in the album as a viable concept in the 21st century. In 2003, Wired magazine had assigned Christgau to write an article discussing if the album was \\"a dying art form\\", to which he concluded: \\"For as long as artists tour, they'll peddle song collections with the rest of the merch, and those collections will be conceived as artfully as the artists possibly can.\\" In 2019, as CD and digital download sales plummeted and theories still persisted about the \\"death\\" of the physical album format, Christgau found his original premise even more valid. \\"Because the computer giveth as the computer taketh away\\", he wrote in an essay accompanying the Pazz & Jop music poll that year, explaining that the current affordability of adequate recording equipment makes album production accessible to musicians of various levels of competence. Regarding professional acts, he said, \\"Writing songs is in their DNA, and if said songs are any good at all, recording them for posterity soon becomes irresistible.\\" In a year-ending essay on the album in 2019, Ann Powers writes for Slate that the year found the medium in a state of \\"metamorphosis\\" rather than dead. In her observation, many recording artists had revitalized the concept album around autobiographical narratives and personal themes, such as intimacy, intersectionality, African-American life, boundaries among women, and grief associated with death. She cites such albums as Brittany Howard's Jaime, Raphael Saadiq's Jimmy Lee, Rapsody's Eve, Jenny Lewis' On the Line, and Nick Cave's Ghosteen. Writing in 2020, arts and culture journalist Michelle Zipkin believes albums are still \\"an integral, relevant, and celebrated component of musical creation and artistry\\". She cites the review aggregator Metacritic's tabulation of the most acclaimed albums from the 2010s, which showcased musicianship from a diverse range of artists and often serious themes, such as grief, race relations, and identity politics, while adding that, \\"Albums today offer a fresh way of approaching a changing industry\\". Between March 6 and 12, 2020, physical album sales fell 6% due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later that month, Amazon temporarily suspended incoming shipments of music CDs and vinyl records from U.S. suppliers in an effort to prioritize items deemed more essential. According to Peter Robinson of The Guardian, while the release format is \\"dead\\" commercially, high-profile artists in the 21st century such as U2, the 1975, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry still presented their work within a self-defined \\"album era\\", representing each project's aesthetic lifetime in the style of themed album campaigns by performers of the past, such as David Bowie, Madonna, and Pet Shop Boys. Quartz declared Swift is the only artist \\"who still sells CDs\\" and that she has not embraced streaming services because they do not compensate recording artists fairly. Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood elaborated on this point, saying, \\"Yet as she kept her music off Spotify ‚Äì conditioning her loyal audience to think of buying her songs and albums as an act of devotion ‚Äì younger artists like [Ariana] Grande emerged to establish themselves as streaming favorites.\\" However, Swift used all major streaming services to release her 2019 album Lover, which Quartz said \\"might be the last CD we buy\\" and is \\"perhaps a final death note for the CD\\".

It was centered near the intersection of West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road, now located within the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney. Valley developed in 1884 following the completion of the South Branch line when the rail line's original southern terminus and corresponding Romney Depot were built there. The United States Post Office Department established a post office at Valley on May 19, 1928, remaining in operation until its disestablishment on June 15, 1937. Following the closure of Valley's post office, its mail was routed through the post office in Romney.  History  The land upon which Valley later developed was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719. Lord Fairfax selected a portion of the proprietary for his manor. This tract, known as the South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary, extended from the north end of the Trough to the junction of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River. In 1748, Fairfax commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale and lease, with lots ranging in size from . Valley was located within the northern section of Lot Number 17 of the South Branch Survey, which Lord Fairfax granted to Samuel Earle in 1749. Earle was a gentleman from Frederick County, Virginia. By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752‚Äì96) was in ownership of Lot Number 17. The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April 17, 1788. Lot Number 17 was bound to the west by the Yellow Banks and the South Branch Potomac River below, to the north by Lot Number 20, and to the south by Lot Number 16. Most of the western area of the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney were located within Lot Number 17. Lot Number 17's eastern boundary stretched between the present-day Savilla-Vale and Wirgman Hill neighborhoods of Romney. The location of Valley was not included in surveyor John Mitchel's plan for Romney dated June 30, 1790, and the forested lands of Depot Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century. Romney Depot, photographed in 1886. In 1883 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad agreed to complete the South Branch Railway Company's planned rail line between Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line and Romney. Construction of the rail line began immediately. Completed in 1884, it spanned a length of . The original southern terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line and the Romney Depot were built at the southern end of Depot Valley, around which Valley developed. The South Branch line formally opened for traffic on September 1, 1884. It was at this time that Depot Valley received its name from the Romney Depot. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad continued to operate the South Branch line and later acquired the property outright by deed on November 20, 1912. The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought residential development on the hilltops to the west and east of Valley. On September 27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863‚Äì1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J. H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one. As Romney Depot's passenger and freight services expanded and a populated place continued to develop around the depot, the need for a post office began to grow. On February 6, 1928, a \\"location form\\" was submitted to the United States Post Office Department suggesting that the Valley post office be located at Romney Depot in Depot Valley. The form noted the post office at Valley would be located a mere northeast of the Vanderlip post office along the South Branch line. The United States Post Office Department established the post office at Valley on May 19, 1928. The post office at Valley was disestablished on June 15, 1937, and its mail was afterward routed to the post office at Romney. Valley was included in a transportation map of Hampshire County compiled by John R. Ice in his New Descriptive Atlas of West Virginia published by Clarksburg Publishing Company in 1933. Beginning with the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a passenger train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after. In 1972, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was merged into the Chessie System, which planned to close and abandon the South Branch line. The Romney spur through Depot Valley remained in service and was illustrated by the United States Geological Survey on its 1973 Romney Quadrangle topographic map. On October 11, 1978, the Chessie System transferred ownership of the South Branch line to the South Branch Valley Railroad, which in turn was owned and operated by the West Virginia State Rail Authority. During this transition, the Romney spur of the South Branch Valley Railroad was abandoned, after which all rail and commercial activity at Valley ceased.  Geography  Valley was located in Depot Valley approximately northwest of downtown Romney. Depot Valley stretches north from West Sioux Lane to Valley View farm, through which a small unnamed tributary stream of Big Run flows, paralleling Depot Valley Road and the former Romney spur of the South Branch rail line for the entirety of its course through the valley. Valley was connected to Romney to the southeast via West Sioux Lane. As of 2014, the former location of Valley and the surrounding Depot Valley are covered by secondary forest. The residential areas on the hill to the west and on Depot Hill to the east remain.

Deffenbaugh (born 1949) is a retired educator and coach from Van Buren in western Arkansas, who is a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. His District 79, which he has represented since 2013, includes part of Crawford County. From 2011 to 2013, he represented House District 66, a position now held by the Republican Josh Miller of Heber Springs. Background Deffenbaugh obtained a bachelor's degree in education from Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia in Clark County in south Arkansas. The former teacher and coach is a Southern Baptist. He and his wife, Carolyn Mae Deffenbaugh (born 1948), have two grown children. Political life In 2010, Deffenbaugh was nominated in the Republican primary election in District 66 over Kevin R. Holmes, 1,426 to 719. He then defeated Democrat Dianna K. Faucher, 5,113 (73.4 percent) to 1,851 (26.6 percent) in the general election.

These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community, notably by the decisions of the UN General Assembly, by regional bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of American States (OAS), and the African Union (AU), and by member states in the United Nations. Following endorsement, these standards apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre- electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath. Electoral malpractices William Hogarth The Polling 1774-1775 The contrary notion of 'electoral malpractice' refers to contests violating international standards and global norms. Problems can arise at every stage of the process, from electoral and ballot access laws favoring incumbents to lack of a level playing field in money and media during campaigns to inaccurate voter registers, flawed counts and partial electoral management bodies. There is nothing novel about problems of flawed or failed elections which suffer from fraud, corruption, or vote-rigging. Indeed, during the 18th and 19th Centuries, such practices were common in countries holding popular contests, including in rotten and pocket boroughs in Britain and machine politics in the United States. Concern about malpractices has grown in recent decades, however, along with the spread of elections to almost every state worldwide. Contemporary campaigns attracting considerable international concern include allegations of irregularities occurring during the 2012 Russian presidential electionand 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Problems of violence during and after the 2007 Kenyan general election, and controversies in the 2013 Cambodian general election. Origins in international law and human rights The foundation of these standards rests on Article 21(3) in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). This specifies that \\"[t]he will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\\" These commitments were further developed in Article 25 of the UN International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR of 1966), namely the need for: * periodic elections at regular intervals; * universal suffrage that includes all sectors of society; * equal suffrage, in the idea of one-person, one-vote; * the right to stand for public office and contest elections; * the rights of all eligible electors to vote; * the use of a secret ballot process; * genuine elections; * elections that reflect the free expression of the will of the people. The 1990 Copenhagen Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) made commitments that included free elections at regular intervals; the popular election of all seats in at least one chamber; universal and equal suffrage; the right to establish political parties and their clear separation from the state; campaigning in a free and fair atmosphere; unimpeded access to media; secret ballots, with counting and reporting conducted honestly and the results reported publicly; and the due winners being installed and allowed to serve their full terms. The 2002 Venice Commission‚Äôs Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters spells out in detail what is meant by principles such as the universal, equal, free, secret, and direct suffrage. Some of the most detailed standards are contained in the practical guidelines for electoral observers published by regional intergovernmental organizations, exemplified by the OSCE Election Observation Handbook.Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 2010. Election Observation Handbook, 6th edition. Warsaw: OSCE/ODIHR. Similar principles have been adopted in the guidelines developed by the African Union, European Union, and Organization of American States. The most recent statement of these norms in the UN General Assembly resolution 63/163 (April 12, 2012): ‚ÄúStrengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing periodic and genuine elections and the promotion of democratization.‚Äù The language in this document reflects and extends a series of similar statements of principle endorsed regularly by the United Nations since 1991. Resolution 63/163 reaffirms that ‚Äúdemocracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives.‚Äù Thus, democratic principles are explicitly endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, along with a commitment to ‚Äúthe importance of fair, periodic and genuine elections‚Äù as the primary mechanism that allows citizens ‚Äúto express their will.‚Äù This does not imply, however, that the United Nations or the international community endorse any specific institutional design or constitutional mechanisms that can best achieve global norms, leaving this as a matter for national sovereignty. The UN resolution recognizes the responsibility of member states, ‚Äúfor ensuring free and fair elections, free of intimidation, coercion and tampering of vote counts, and that all such acts are sanctioned accordingly.‚Äù The United Nations‚Äô role (especially through the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme) is seen as one of providing electoral assistance and support for the promotion of democratization, but only at the specific request of the member state. Evidence for electoral integrity and malpractices Attempts to document evidence of violations of international standards of electoral integrity can be found in the electoral observer monitoring reports published after each election by regional organizations. Comparative evidence is also available from the expert survey of Perceptions of Electoral Integrity conducted by the Electoral Integrity Project. This includes the report, part of an annual series, \\"The year in Elections, 2013\\" monitoring the quality of 73 presidential and parliamentary elections. In 2016, Arizona scored the worst in the U.S., with a 53, and Vermont the best, with a 75, on a scale of 100, the Arizona Republic reported. Slate reported that a score of 58 is around the same as Cuba. The WSJ remarked that with a score of 56, Cuba \\"jails political dissidents, hasn't transferred power since 1959, unless the 2008 presidential handoff to Ra√∫l Castro from Fidel Castro counts.\\" See also *Election Defense Alliance *Electoral fraud *Elections *ICCPR *Political corruption *Political finance *Venice Commission *Voting rights *Universal Declaration of Human Rights ReferencesExternal links *IFES Election Guide *Electoral Integrity Project Category:Elections Category:Election law Category:Human rights Category:Democracy Category:Democratization ","title":"Electoral integrity"},{"id":"41560177","text":"Lethrinus is a genus of emperors found from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean.

History Schloss Fu√überg lies to the north of the historic center of Gauting on the left bank of the W√ºrm. It is named after the 12th century noble family of Fu√ü, also written as Fuoz, Vuoz or in Latin \\"pes\\", followers of the House of Wittelsbach. The original castle was in a loop of the W√ºrm, protected by a moat. The octagonal tower was first documented in 1342. No traces remain. The replacing castle with living quarters and farm buildings was built in the 16th century. It was depicted in 1701 in Michael Wening's Historico-Topographica descriptio Bavariae. The present building was erected in 1721 on the medieval foundations. It is a baroque building that served as a summer residence for the Andechs Abbey and a resting place on the route to Munich. After the monasteries were secularized, in 1819 the castle was acquired by Karl Theodor Maria, Freiherr von Hallberg- Broich die Anlage. He was an eccentric who had traveled widely. He dressed casually and became known as the \\"hermit of Gauting\\". He undertook a project to drain the Erdinger Moos. He painted the doors and windows of the castle vermilion, but since then they have been repainted in white. The Belvedere in the park was built in the 19th Century. The castle was purchased by the community in 1981, and the English-style landscaped park is now open to the public. Most of the building is leased to a private company. The former coach house, a building with a huge hipped roof and curved Art Nouveau dormer windows, is available for art and cultural events. It is used for theater, concerts, lectures, exhibitions and festivals. It can accommodate up to 175 visitors.

Langton was born in Gravesend, Kent, England, the youngest son of David Elland Langton, a butcher, and his wife Mary, n√©e Payne. Langton migrated to Melbourne in 1852, aged 24, becoming involved in politics in the late 1850s. Langton unsuccessfully contested the Victorian Legislative Assembly seats of Collingwood in 1859 and 1861, East Melbourne in 1861, East Bourke Boroughs in 1864, and Dundas in 1865. Langton eventually had electoral success and represented East Melbourne from February 1866 until December 1867. Then from May 1868 to April 1877 he represented West Melbourne. On 6 May 1868 Langton, who was a staunch Conservative as well as a Free-trader, became Treasurer of Victoria in Charles Sladen's short-lived Ministry, and occupied the same post, with the additional office of Postmaster-General of Victoria, in the James Francis Government, from 10 June 1872 to 31 July 1874, when he resigned with his colleagues. Langton has written much for the Melbourne press, and was one of the earliest proprietors of the Spectator, a free trade organ started in 1865. He was secretary of the Free Trade League of Victoria from its commencement until 1866, was an honorary member of the Cobden Club from 1874, and was a trustee and treasurer of the Melbourne Public Library and Museum. Langton was again unsuccessful in contesting Castlemaine February 1880, West Melbourne in 1886, Toorak in 1892 and 1894, and East Melbourne in 1897.

It was first formed in 1936 from the 3rd Kolkhoz Rifle Division in the Soviet Far East, and in the spring of 1941 converted to the 69th Motorized Division. Sent west after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, it was reorganized into the 107th Tank Division shortly after arriving at the front. The division fought in the Battle of Smolensk before being redesignated the 107th Motor Rifle Division in September. The 107th fought in the Battle of Moscow and became the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division in honor of its actions in the battle. The 69th Rifle Division was reformed in December 1941, distinguishing itself in at least two battles. It was credited with the liberation of the town of Sevsk on 26 August 1943. On 15 October 1943 it made a successful assault crossing of the Dnepr River south of Gomel; 21 officers and men of the division were decorated as Heroes of the Soviet Union for this action. Postwar, the 69th was withdrawn to Vologda, where it remained for the rest of its existence. Between 1946 and 1953 it was reduced to the 25th Separate Rifle Brigade. It became the 69th Motor Rifle Division in 1957 and was reduced to a storage base in 1989.  1st Formation  Using German intelligence data, Poirer and Connor wrote that the division was first organized as the 69th Motorized Rifle Division and was established at Kuibyshev in the Russian SFSR sometime in the early 1930s.Poirer and Connor However, Crofoot and Avanziani write that the division was established at Khabarovsk, RSFSR, in early 1936 from a cadre provided by the 3rd Rifle Division (Soviet Union).Crofoot, Avanzani, Armies of the Bear, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 113 According to the most recent Russian sources, the 69th was originally formed as the 3rd Kolkhoz Rifle Division of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army in 1932. On 21 May 1936, the division was released from Kolkhoz duty and redesignated the 69th Rifle Division. In March 1941, it was reorganized as the 69th Motorized Division, and its 8th Rifle and 222nd Artillery Regiments were disbanded. A separate unit of the 2nd Red Banner Army, the division was stationed in the Blagoveshchensk area. Shortly after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June, the division was sent west to the front by a General Staff directive of 25 June. On 10 July it unloaded in the Nelidovo and Olenino area. On 15 July (17 July according to rkka.ru),http://www.rkka.ru/handbook/reg/69md41.htm, accessed July 2011 it became the 107th Tank Division. After making a 200-kilometer march, the 107th joined the Reserve Front's 30th Army and took up defensive positions on the line of Bely and Yelnya. During the Battle of Smolensk, the division attacked with 200 tanks on 20 July towards Dukhovshchina in an attempt to take Smolensk, but was repulsed with heavy losses. The division then fought in defensive battles on the Western Front, and had 153 tanks at the beginning of September. Soon after it was redesignated as the 107th Motorized Division. On 1 October, the division had only 125 tanks: three KV tanks, 23 T-34s, one BT, 92 T-26s and six T-37s. In early October, the 107th fought in heavy fighting, trapped in a pocket by Operation Typhoon in the Volynovo, Samsonikha, and Bykovo areas. In seventeen days it was able to break out of the encirclement and reach the Mozhaisk Defense Line. Replenished with personnel, artillery, and tanks, the 107th then held positions on the Lama River. In three days of defensive battles in the area of Ilyinsky, Domarino, and Pokrovskoye, the division was credited with destroying 46 tanks, four armored vehicles, and ten guns and mortars. On 12 January 1942, in recognition of its achievements, the 107th was converted into an elite Guards unit, the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division. Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, appears to indicate that the division was split into both the 107th and 108th Tank Divisions.Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1998, pp. 222, 231, and associated endnotes at pp. 324-325 (notes 47-49). Endnotes to Glantz's 1998 book indicate the 108th Tank division was in combat with the Bryansk Front circa 28 August 1941 to 4 September 1941, and on 28 August it had a strength of 62 tanks (5 KVs, 32 T-34s, and 25 T-40s).Glantz 1998, page 325, note 49.  2nd Formation  The division was reformed at Tashkent, in the Central Asia Military District, from December 1941 to 14 February 1942. For the duration of the war its main order of battle was as follows: * 120th Rifle Regiment * 237th Rifle Regiment * 303rd Rifle Regiment * 118th Artillery Regiment * 99th Sapper Battalion * 20th Reconnaissance Company.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 23 On 14 February, when Col. (later, Maj. Gen.) M. A. Bogdanov was assigned as divisional commander, the division went to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, then in March to the Western Front reserves, and finally in April to 50th Army of Western Front, remaining there until February 1943. This sector was mostly quiet during this period.Glantz, \\"Ivan Vasilievich Boldin\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, ed.), Phoenix Press, London, UK, 2001, p. 51 By 1 March the 69th Rifle Division had been transferred south to the 65th Army of Gen. K. K. Rokossovsky's Central Front. Apart from a brief transfer to the 52nd Army in July 1944 it remained in this Army, commanded by Gen. Pavel Batov, and under Rokossovsky's overall command, for the duration of the war. By June the division had been assigned to the 18th Rifle Corps, where it also remained for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 23-24 Central Front became Belorussian Front in October, then 1st Belorussian Front in February 1944. At this point it was necessary to rebuild the division, as casualties from the summer and autumn offensives had reduced the rifle regiments to the effective strength of just two battalions each. At this time, and during the following summer, the division was receiving replacements from the 218th Reserve Rifle Regiment.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 24 In November the 69th, along with the rest of 65th Army, transferred to Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front.

Postwar  Postwar, it was part of the 65th Army's 18th Rifle Corps in the Northern Group of Forces in Poland. After 65th Army became a mechanized army the division became part of the 43rd Army in June 1946. After the army was disbanded the division moved to Vologda later that year. At Vologda it was downsized into the 25th Separate Rifle Brigade, part of the Arkhangelsk Military District (Belomorsky Military District from 1951). In October 1953 it became a division again, with the 120th, 237th, and 303rd Rifle Regiments, as well as the 148th Tank Regiment. In April 1956, the 69th joined the Northern Military District's 44th Special Rifle Corps when the district headquarters was disbanded. On 4 June 1957 the 69th Rifle Division became the 69th Motor Rifle Division, and around the same time the corps became the 44th Special Army Corps. Its rifle regiments were renumbered as the 267th, 268th, and 303rd Motor Rifle Regiments. In 1960, the Northern Military District was abolished and the corps joined the Leningrad Military District, becoming a regular army corps soon afterwards. On 1 July 1967, after the 44th Corps departed for the Soviet Far East, the 69th Motor Rifle Division became part of the new 26th Army Corps. The 148th Tank Regiment was reorganized into the 87th Separate Tank Battalion in 1987. In the late 1980s, the 69th included the 267th, 268th, and 303rd Motor Rifle Regiments, the 87th Separate Tank Battalion, the 118th Artillery Regiment, and support units, all stationed at Vologda. In 1989, the division was converted into the 5189th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base. On 19 November 1990, according to CFE treaty reports, the base was equipped with 38 T-55 tanks, 35 PT-76 light tanks, twelve BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, fifteen BTR-50PUM command vehicles, six R-145BM command vehicles, seven BTR-50PU command vehicles, one PRP-3 artillery reconnaissance vehicles, two UR-67 mine clearing vehicles, and four MTU bridgelaying vehicles. The storage base was disbanded in 1993.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 20, 2012. The episode guest stars George Takei as Ricardio. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) and Lady Rainicorn (voiced by Niki Yang) go searching for Finn and Jake, who have been missing for three weeks after fighting with the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny). It is revealed that Ricardio, the Ice King's living heart, has trapped them and wishes to marry Bubblegum. Bubblegum eventually defeats Ricardio in hand-to- hand combat, and saves the day. \\"Lady & Peebles\\" featured the return of Takei, who had previously voiced Ricardio in the first season episode, \\"Ricardio the Heart Guy\\". Several video games inspired elements of the episode, including The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. \\"Lady & Peebles\\" was watched by 2.754 million people and received largely positive critical attention, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praising Takei's voice acting, and Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle applauding the female-centric nature of the episode. The episode was later nominated for an Annie Award. Plot Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn investigate a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake may have been captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a ventilation shaft. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes. As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate and shoot laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady. Bubblegum plods on in the dark, carrying an unconscious Lady around her shoulders. Suddenly, she stumbles upon the disemboweled body of the oblivious Ice King. From the dark, Ricardio, the living heart of the Ice King, introduces himself, tossing an unconscious Finn and Jake into the light. Ricardio reveals that he built himself both a body as well as the dungeon complex in an attempt to impress Bubblegum. He reveals that he wishes to marry her; Bubblegum agrees to marry Ricardio if he can beat her in hand-to-hand combat. After a short fight, Bubblegum disarms Ricardio and forces him to flee, wounded, into the darkness. Later, at the Candy Kingdom, Finn, Jake, the Ice King, and Lady recover, and Lady reveals to Jake that she is pregnant. Production The episode marked the return of George Takei as Ricardio. \\"Lady & Peebles\\" was storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It was directed by Larry Leichliter with Adam Muto serving as creative director and Nick Jennings serving as art director. Sugar, the eventual creator of the Cartoon Network series Steven Universe, began working on said program's pilot episode while she was storyboarding this episode. The episode features the return of the anthropomorphic heart villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny called \\"the valentine from Hell\\". Takei had previously played the role in the season one episode \\"Ricardio the Heart Guy\\". In the commentary track for the episode, Sugar explained that she saw Bubblegum as the victim of sexual harassment by Ricardio, and that the only way for her to solve the problem was for her to turn the situation around and somehow overcome Ricardio's chauvinism. In the episode, this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best him in combat. Sugar reveled in the fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with, noting that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. Robert Ryan Cory, a character designer most known for his work on the Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants, storyboarded the panels featuring Princess Bubblegum stomping on Ricardio and grinding her foot into his face. Because he drew the panels, lead character designer Andy Ristaino also allowed Cory to finalize the character designs for the scene. He later posted them on his official Flickr account. The episode reveals that Lady Rainicorn is pregnant with Jake's children. This plot point would later be revisited in the fifth season episode \\"Jake the Dad\\". In the first draft of the ending, Lady Rainicorn was supposed to break up with Jake because he was causing her to be too stressed. However, the crew decided this was a bad idea, and it was changed to Rainicorn telling Jake that she is pregnant. As with all of Lady's dialogue, it was originally planned for the pregnancy revelation to be in Korean, but the crew felt that such a revelation would be lost on most of the audience. Several video games inspired elements of the episode. Ricardio's bio-engineered body was based on the finale incarnation of Majora, a character from the eponymous video game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (2000). The general look of Ricardio's dungeon was inspired by the video games Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (2002) and the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2010). The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery; for instance, Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic. Reception \\"Lady & Peebles\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on August 8, 2012. The episode was viewed by 2.754 million viewers and scored a 0.5 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.5 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. Critical reception to the episode was largely positive. Sava awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", and wrote that Ricardio is \\"always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei‚Äôs delightful voice work.\\" Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that \\"there‚Äôs a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King‚Äôs nasality\\", and that \\"Takei always sounds like he‚Äôs having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him.\\" Sava also wrote positively of Bubblegum's character, noting that she \\"dominates this episode\\" and that the \\"episode reveals a side of her that we rarely see, and hopefully we‚Äôll get more of badass PB in the future.\\" Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle wrote that the episode is \\"Princess Bubblegum-centric\\", which, along with the third season episode \\"Fionna and Cake\\", provides the female fans of the show an opportunity to see female characters acting in situations normally reserved for Finn and Jake. The Entertainment Examiner named the episode as one of the \\"memorable\\" episodes that appeared on the 2013 DVD release Fionna and Cake. The episode was nominated for an Annie Award for \\"Storyboarding in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production\\" at the 40th Annie Awards, although the episode did not win.

During the civil war that convulsed the Carolingian Empire following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious in 840, Immo supported the emperor's youngest son, Charles the Bald, from 841. A letter to Immo from his archbishop, Hincmar of Reims, survives from 846. Hincmar was summoning Immo the consecration of Ermenfrid as bishop of Beauvais, which was taking place in time for Ermenfrid to attend the synod of Paris on 14 February 846. Another surviving letter of Hincmar instructs Immo to assist in the consecration of bishop Pardulus of Laon in 847. In 859, probably late in August, according to the Annales Bertiniani, \\"Vikings attacked Noyon by night and took captive Bishop Immo and a number of other nobles, both clerics and layment.\\" The bishop was killed \\"on the march\\", perhaps because he tried to resist or escape. The acts of the synod of Tuzey, which opened on 22 October 860, are signed by Immo and his successor, Raginelm. The contradictory signatures were already dismissed as a forgery by Hincmar. Nevertheless, some modern scholars have dismissed the Annales as mistaken and placed Immo's either between the opening of the synod and its closing (7 November) or after the synod (as late as 861).

The event occurred in early 2014 and was caused by a southward shift of the North Polar Vortex. Record-low temperatures also extended well into March. On January 2, an Arctic cold front initially associated with a nor'easter tracked across Canada and the United States, resulting in heavy snowfall. Temperatures fell to unprecedented levels, and low temperature records were broken across the United States. Business, school, and road closures were common, as well as mass flight cancellations. Altogether, more than 200 million people were affected, in an area ranging from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and extending south to include roughly 187 million residents of the Continental United States. Origins Beginning on January 2, 2014, sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) led to the breakdown of the semi-permanent feature across the Arctic known as the polar vortex. Without an active upper-level vortex to keep frigid air bottled up across the Arctic, the cold air mass was forced southward as upper-level warming displaced the jet stream. With extensive snow-cover across Canada and Siberia, Arctic air had no trouble remaining extremely cold as it was forced southward into the United States. According to the UK Met Office, the jet stream deviated to the south (bringing cold air with it) as a result of unusual contrast between cold air in Canada and mild winter temperatures in the United States. This produced significant wind where the air masses met, leading to bitter wind chills and worsening the impacts of the record cold temperatures.

Over a dozen deaths were attributed to the cold wave, with dangerous roadway conditions and extreme cold cited as causes. At least 3,600 flights were cancelled on January 6, and several thousand were cancelled over the preceding weekend. Further delays were caused by the weather at airports that did not possess de-icing equipment. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, the jet fuel and deicing fluids froze, according to American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller. Amtrak cancelled scheduled passenger rail service having connections through Chicago, due to heavy snows or extreme cold. Three Amtrak trains were stranded overnight on January 6, approximately west of Chicago, near Mendota, Illinois, due to ice and snowdrifts on the tracks. The 500 passengers were loaded onto buses the next morning for the rest of the trip to Chicago. Another Amtrak train was stuck near Kalamazoo, Michigan for 8 hours, while en route from Detroit to Chicago. Chicago Metra commuter trains reported numerous accidents. Detroit shut down its People Mover due to the low temperatures on January 7.Bone-Chilling Temps Shut Down Detroit People Mover, CBS News, January 7, 2014 Light snow in Tennessee Between January 5 and 6, temperatures fell in Middle Tennessee, dropping to a high of on Monday, January 6 in Nashville. During the cold wave, the strain on the power supply left 1,200 customers in Nashville without power, along with around 7,500 customers in Blount County. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Twenty-four thousand residents lost power in Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.'Historic and life-threatening' freeze brings rare danger warning, CNN, January 6, 2014 The Weather Channel reported power outages in several states, abandoned cars on highways in North Carolina, and freezing rain in Louisiana. =Canada= A power failure in Newfoundland, late on January 5, left 190,000 customers without electricity. Most of the outages were restored by the following day. Air transportation was delayed out of airports in Montreal and Ottawa, as well as completely cancelled at Toronto Pearson International Airport, due to concerns about de-icing. =Ecological= Early news reporting suggested that the severe cold would cause high mortality among the emerald ash borer based on the opinion of a US Department of Agriculture spokesperson suggesting \\"The progressive loss of ash trees in North America due to this insect has probably been delayed by this deep freeze.\\" This has been widely repudiated based on scientific studies of underbark temperature tolerances of emerald ash borer in Canada. Government response The weather affected schools, roads, and public offices. =United States= Loaders clear Summit Avenue of snow in Union City, New Jersey the evening of February 15, 2014. In Minnesota, all public schools statewide were closed on January 6 by order of Governor Mark Dayton. This had not been done in 17 years. In Wisconsin, schools in most (if not all) of the state were closed on January 6 as well as on January 7. When the second cold wave emerged, schools were also closed on January 27 and 28. In Michigan, the mayor of Lansing, Virg Bernero, issued a snow emergency prohibiting all non-essential travel as well as closing down non-essential government offices. In Indiana, more than fifty of the state's ninety-two counties, including virtually everywhere north of Indianapolis, closed all roads to all traffic except emergency vehicles. In Ohio, schools across the entire state were closed on January 6 and 7, including the state's largest two school districts, Columbus City Schools and Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The Ohio State University completely shut down on January 6 and 7, delaying the start of the spring semester by two days for the first closure on two consecutive days in 36 years. On March 4, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4076; 113th Congress) in reaction to the extreme cold weather. The bill, if it becomes law, would create an emergency exception to existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations. The exceptions would allow truckers to drive for long hours if they are delivering home heating fuels, such as propane, to places where there is a shortage. The exemption would last until May 31, 2014. An existing suspension was scheduled to expire on March 15, 2014. According to Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the issue of household energy costs need to be addressed because \\"the Energy Information Administration predicted that 90 percent of U.S. households would see higher home heating costs this year, and low income families already spend 12 percent of their household budget on energy costs.\\" Rep. Shuster argued in favor of the bill saying that it \\"will provide relief for millions of Americans suffering from the current propane and home heating fuel emergency.\\" According to the Congressman, an \\"exceptionally cold winter\\" increased demand on propane, \\"which is used for heating approximately 12 million homes in the United States.\\" =Canada= Schools in much of Southern Ontario and rural Manitoba were closed on both January 6 and 7 because of the combined threat of extreme cold, strong winds, and heavy snowfall. Outside the areas of heavy snowfall, schools remained open both days. Hamilton and Toronto issued Extreme Cold Weather Alerts and Ottawa issued a Frostbite Alert, which both open up additional shelter spaces for the homeless.Cold weather Resource Kit City of Ottawa official site In Quebec, all public services remained open, with the exception of tutoring and any other services requiring exterior relocation. Role of climate change Research on a possible connection between individual extreme weather events and long-term anthropogenic climate change is a new topic of scientific debate. Prior to the events of January 2014, several studies on the connection between extreme weather and the polar vortex were published suggesting a link between climate change and increasingly extreme temperatures experienced by mid-latitudes (e.g., central North America).    This phenomenon has been suggested by some to result from the rapid melting of polar sea ice, which replaces white, reflective ice with dark, absorbent open water (i.e., the albedo of this region has decreased). As a result, the region has heated up faster than other parts of the globe. With the lack of a sufficient temperature difference between Arctic and southern regions to drive jet stream winds, the jet stream may have become weaker and more variable in its course, allowing cold air usually confined to the poles to reach further into the mid latitudes.  * This jet stream instability brings warm air north as well as cold air south. The patch of unusual cold over the eastern United States was matched by anomalies of mild winter temperatures across Greenland and much of the Arctic north of Canada, and unusually warm conditions in Alaska. A stationary high pressure ridge over the North Pacific Ocean kept California unusually warm and dry for the time of year, worsening ongoing drought conditions there.More on the Drought; The Numbers Are Frightening AccuWeather, January 6, 2014 Research has led to a good documentation of the frequency and seasonality of sudden warmings: just over half of the winters since 1960 have experienced a major warming event in January or February\\".GEOS-5 Analyses and Forecasts of the Major Stratospheric Sudden Warming of January 2013 NASA According to Charlton and Polvani sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in the Arctic has occurred during 60% of the winters since 1948 and 48% of these SSW events have led to the splitting of the polar vortex, leading to the same type of Arctic cold front that happened in January 2014. A 2001 study found that \\"there is no apparent trend toward fewer extreme cold events in Europe or North America over the 1948‚Äì99 period, although a long station history suggests that such events may have been more frequent in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s.\\"Extreme Cold Outbreaks in the United States and Europe, 1948‚Äì99 American Meteorological Society June 2001 A 2009 MIT study found that such events are increasing and may be caused by the rapid loss of the Arctic ice pack. SSW events of similar magnitude occurred in 1985 in North America, and in 2009 and 2010 in Europe. Extended cold=United States= The NOAA's National Climatic Data Center found that since modern records began in 1895, the period from December 2013 through February 2014 was the 34th-coldest such period for the contiguous 48 states as a whole. The average temperature for the contiguous U.S. during the winter season was , one degree below the 20th-century average, and the number of daily record-low temperatures outnumbered the number of record-high temperatures nationally in early 2014. In contrast, California had its warmest winter on record, being 4.4 ¬∞F (2.4 ¬∞C) above average, while first two months of 2014 were the warmest on record in Fresno, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Nevada, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. In addition, while December through February was the ninth driest on record for the contiguous 48 states dating to 1895, chiefly due to extremely dry conditions in the West and Southwest, yet Winter snow cover areal extent was the 10th-largest on record for same 48 states, dating to 1966. New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago all had one of their ten snowiest winters, while Detroit had its snowiest winter on record. Aside from persistence due to lack of melting, the lower temperatures may have had some impact‚Äîwhilst snowfall has an average moisture content ratio of 10:1 (one inch of moisture producing 10 inches of snow), it can range from 3:1 to 100:1, generally rising with falling temperatures, documented instances in the North Central states of snowfalls with ratios from 75:1MWS Milwaukee-Sullivan January 13, 2014 up towards the maximum possible of 100:1 were observed and those in excess of 30:1 were rather common because of the temperatures in which the snow formed and fell. Many cities experienced their coldest February in many years: * Rochester, Minnesota experienced its fourth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Green Bay, Wisconsin saw its third-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Minneapolis-St. Paul tied its record for the seventh-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Dubuque, Iowa realized its third-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Madison, Wisconsin saw its tenth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Moline, Illinois tied its record for the fifth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Fort Wayne, Indiana experienced its sixth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Peoria, Illinois saw its sixth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of * Kansas City, Kansas had its ninth-coldest February, with a monthly average temperature of Daily record lows were set on February 28 in Gaylord, Michigan at , Green Bay, Wisconsin with , Flint, Michigan at , Grand Rapids, Michigan , and Toledo, Ohio at while Newberry, Michigan dipped to . During the official meteorological winter season of December through February, Brainerd, Minnesota averaged a meager , and realized its third-coldest winter in recorded history. Similarly, the average temperature in Duluth, Minnesota was , ranking this winter as its second- coldest. The first week of March 2014 also saw remarkably low temperatures in many places, with 18 states setting all-time records for cold. Among them was Flint, Michigan, which reached March 3, and Rockford, Illinois at . Caribou, and Bangor, Maine, Barre/Montpelier, Vt., Glens Falls, N.Y., Dulles Airport, Gaylord, and Houghton Lake, Mich. experienced their coldest March on record in 2014. In addition, March was the second-coldest on record for Concord, N.H. Flint and International Falls, Minn. and Watertown, N.Y. and Marquette, Mich. both saw their third-coldest. The entire December‚ÄìMarch period in Chicago was the coldest on record, topping the previous record from 1903‚Äì04, even colder than the notoriously cold winters of the late 1970s. The average temperature in Chicago from December 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 was , below average. The state of Iowa went through its ninth-coldest winter in 141 years. Only the winters of 1935‚Äì36 and 1978‚Äì79 in the last century were colder, with the others being back in the 1880s. March was near-record cold for the Southeastern U.S, where three states‚ÄîTennessee, Alabama, and Georgia‚Äîhad their coldest March on record. Despite the abnormally cold winter over sections of North America and much of Russia, most of the globe saw either average or above-average temperatures during the first four months of 2014. In fact, during the cold wave, North America saw much colder temperatures than Sochi, Russia which during the time was hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics. During the last week of March, meteorologists expected average temperatures to return sometime from April to mid-May. On April 10, 2014, a ridge of high pressure moved into the Eastern United States, bringing average and above-average temperatures to the region, which ended the cold wave. =Canada= As of February 27, Winnipeg was experiencing the second-coldest winter in 75 years, the coldest in 35 years and with snowfall total being 50 per cent more than normal. Saskatoon was experiencing the coldest winter in 18 years; Windsor, Ontario, the coldest winter in 35 years and snowiest winter on record; Toronto, the coldest winter in 20 years; St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the coldest winter in 20 years, the snowiest winter in seven years and a record number of stormy days. Vancouver, which is known for its milder weather, was realizing one of its coldest and snowiest Februarys in 25 years. In 2010 the U.S. winter period December ‚Äì February had experienced its coldest in 25 years, while Canada had its warmest winter on record.

St. Andrew's is the third church to serve as the diocesan cathedral. History St. Andrew‚Äôs began as a mission station in 1839. The Domestic Missionary Society of the Episcopal Church in New York sent a clergyman, hymnals and prayer books. The congregation numbered eight communicants at its beginning. St. Andrew‚Äôs became a parish of the Diocese of Mississippi in 1843. It was the only parish at the time that was not located along the Mississippi River. Its church was burned by the Union Army during the American Civil War in 1863. The cornerstone for the second church was laid by the Rt. Rev. William Mercer Green in 1869. By the turn of the Twentieth Century the congregation had outgrown its church building and the present structure was completed in 1903. The Parish House was constructed between 1923 and 1924. The congregation continued to grow and the building along West Street was built in 1955. The bishop moved his offices into the new building. The service area behind the church was made into a courtyard. The wing on the east side was built in 1987. Cathedrals in the Episcopal Church in the United States were not popular until the Oxford Movement began. The Diocese of Mississippi was no different in this regard and did not have a cathedral in its first decades. St. Peter's Church in Oxford was named the first cathedral when the Rt. Rev. Hugh M. Thompson was bishop. Bishop Thompson moved to Jackson and believed the cathedral should be in the city where he resided. Therefore, St. Columba's Church was named the diocesan cathedral and served that purpose until just after Thompson's death. St. Andrew's, which grew to become the largest parish in the diocese, was elevated to be the cathedral on January 19, 1966. It became the third church in the diocese to serve this purpose. Architecture St. Andrew‚Äôs Cathedral was designed in the Gothic Revival style. When it was built the roof featured a gable in the middle of each side with elaborate trim, which was typical of the late Victorian period. After a fire in 1930 they were simplified. The interior of sanctuary is cruciform in shape, which is found in the center aisle and the crossing. There are no transepts to give that impression on the exterior. The windows throughout the church were filled with amber glass. They have subsequently been replaced with stained glass since the 1950s. They were all given as memorials. The original altar, lectern and pulpit were made of carved wood. The marble altar, bronze winged angel, and pulpit were given as memorials. The pews all have a trefoil carved in the end that represent the Trinity. The X-shaped cross, or saltire, that is found in several places in the cathedral is the emblem of St. Andrew.

It is under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cotabato. Santo Ni√±o Parish is the oldest parish church established by the missionary congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1939. History The pioneering OMI priests took over the missionary territory of Cotabato which includes Midsayap which during that time covers Midsayap, Libungan, Pigcawayan, Alamada and Aleosan. It was initiated by a French-Canadian Oblate priest, Rev. Fr. Egide Beaudin, OMI to fortify the evangelization of Christian settlers in the locality who were mostly coming from Visayas and Luzon who dreamed of living in Mindanao - the so-called Land of Promise. Fr. Beaudin made frequent contacts with the faithfuls where in just a few months of his work, he was able to learn the Cebuano language, earning him as a lovable and jubilant fatherly figure. Fr. Gil as he was fondly called by the people, Beaudin got enormous help from the people which made it possible to construct a worship place earnestly dedicated to the Child Jesus to whom most Cebuano settlers adored from their hometown of Cebu where He is highly revered. They were able to celebrate their first ever fiesta immediately to highlight the success of completing the church. Fr. Beaudin was given full support by fellow missionaries to continue the missionary zeal of spreading the Gospel even to the harshest stations such as Cotabato populated my majority Muslim and Islam adhering Filipinos. When the Second World War broke in 1941, the flourishing mission parish of Santo Ni√±o was closed as worldwide turmoil reached Mindanao by invading Japanese forces. Foreign missionaries including the Oblates were put to concentration camps in the University of Santo Tomas and the University of the Philippines in Los Ba√±os, Laguna. After the war, the OMI priests went back to Midsayap to pursue the missioning to its people. American oblates took over the management of their mission stations including schools. Rev. Fr. Cuthbert B. Billman, OMI became the parish priest from 1945‚Äì1946. He was followed by Rev. Fr. Robert E. Sullivan, OMI from 1947-1948 which was also the time when the oblates established the first Notre Dame school in the Asia, the Notre Dame of Midsayap College. From 1949‚Äì1950, the parish was under Rev. Fr. Joseph Billman, OMI and assisted by Rev. Fr. Edward Gordon, OMI and Rev. Fr. Francis McSorley, OMI (who was later appointed as bishop-prelate of the Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo which covers the whole provinces of Sulu and Tawi- Tawi). In 1951‚Äì1952, Rev. Fr. Joseph Baynes, OMI took charge of the parish with the help from a pioneering Filipino oblate priest, Rev. Fr. Natalio Tabada, OMI who, during that time was being trained to parish management so that Filipino clergyman will soon become parish priests themselves. In the years 1953‚Äì1954, Rev. Fr. Jan Kuilboer, OMI took the challenge of managing the parish assisted by a Filipino, Rev. Fr. Crisonogo Echavez, OMI. Another Filipino oblate, Rev. Fr. Santos Mendoza, OMI became the priest in charge in 1955. He was followed in 1956 by a highly spirited American, Rev. Fr. Philip Smith, OMI who later became bishop of Cotabato, subsequently promoted to become a metropolitan archbishop when Cotabato was elevated into an archdiocese. Archbishop Philip Smith, OMI was then followed by fellow oblates who served Midsayap for one year namely; Rev. Cyril Canning, OMI assisted by Rev. Fr. Andrew Horgan, OMI in 1957, Rev. Fr. Matthew Casey, OMI in 1958; Rev. Andrew Horgan, OMI assisted by Rev. Jan Kuilboer, OMI and Rev. Fr. Clarence Bertelsman in 1959. From 1960‚Äì1961, Rev. Fr. Charles Prass, OMI became parish priest with the help from Rev. Fr. Benedicto Carreon, OMI (who later worked for Mindanao Cross in Cotabato City and Radio Veritas in Manila) and Rev. Fr. John Nep Chai, OMI. They were replaced by Rev. Fr. Thomas Lenert, OMI as parish priest and Rev. Fr. Francis Hickley, OMI and Rev. Ernest Sylvestre, OMI as assistants. Rev. Fr. George Baynes, OMI returned to Midsayap as parish priest and was assisted by another returnee, Rev. Fr. Natalio Tabada, OMI from 1964‚Äì1965. Rev. Fr. Justin Huelsing, OMI manage the parish in 1967-1967 followed by Rev. Fr. Jerome Jankord, OMI assisted by Rev. Maurice Hermann, OMI in 1968‚Äì1969. During the 1970s, the OMI congregation deemed it was time to slowly turn over the parish to Filipino priests by assigning them to large parishes such as Santo Ni√±o. From 1970‚Äì1974, Rev. Fr. Donald Mundy, OMI commissioned a young Filipino oblate priest, Rev. Fr. Amador T. Castillo, OMI to work out major expansions in the parish by creating new chapels in the outskirts and remote barrios of Midsayap and Aleosan(which is part of the parish during that time). From 1975‚Äì1977, an all-Filipino team of oblate priests took charge of the progressive parish with Rev. Fr. Elino Isip, OMI as parish priest and Rev. Fr. Eliseo Mercado, Jr., OMI (who later became president of Notre Dame University in Cotabato City), Rev. Fr. Manuel Mina, OMI, Rev. Fr. Carmelino Razon, OMI and Rev. Fr. Marcelino Andres, OMI comprising the team. For the last 2 years of the decade in 1978‚Äì1979, Rev. Fr. Antero Berboso, OMI became parish priest assisted by Rev. Fr. Amador T. Castillo, OMI and Rev. Fr. Doroteo Reyes, OMI (both became presidents of the Notre Dame of Midsayap College). In 1980‚Äì1981, Rev. Fr. Carmilino Razon, OMI became parish priest assisted by Rev. Fr. Ignacio Rellin, OMI (who was later appointed president of the Notre Dame of Midsayap College), Rev. Fr. Raul Biasbas, OMI and Rev. Fr. Rey Roda, OMI (who was murdered in Sulu). Rev. Fr. Antero Berboso, OMI came back in 1981-1985 as parish priest with the help from Rev. Fr. Enrique Gonzales, OMI and Rev. Fr. Rey Roda, OMI. From 1986‚Äì1988, Rev. Fr. Nestor Silva, OMI and Rev. Fr. Prospero Gacis, OMI became parish priest and assistant priest, respectively. Rev. Fr. Danilo Sergio, OMI was chosen to manage Santo Ni√±o Parsh from 1989-1991 and followed by Rev. Fr. Henry Carlos, OMI from 1992‚Äì1993. The vibrant missionary post of the oblates was pointed to Rev. Fr. Ramon Vicente Quiogue, OMI as parish priest from 1993-1993 assisted by Rev. Fr. Alfonso Cari√±o, OMI and Rev. Fr. Henry Carlos, OMI. The following year of 1995, Rev. Fr. Carmelino Razon, OMI returned to Midsayap duly assisted by newly ordained Rev. Fr. Edmundo Santoto, OMI and Rev. Fr. Oscar Lucas, OMI. In 1996, Rev. Fr. Dennis Gui, OMI served Santo Ni√±o for a year. The next year of 1997, we saw Rev. Fr. Eleno Balboa, OMI heading the parish with the assistance from Rev. Fr. Marcelino Andamon, OMI and Rev. Fr. Rizalde Orola, OMI. From 1998‚Äì2001, Rev. Fr. Chalie Inzon, OMI led the parish. For the period of 001‚Äì2006, Rev. Fr. Edmundo Santoyo, OMI assisted by Rev. Fr. Danilo Sergio, OMI and the younger Rev. Fr. Jay Virador, OMI triumphantly made large developments in the church renovation of the already old church. Another team of visionary priests replace them led by Rev. Fr. Lauro S. De Guia, OMI (presently the Provincial Superior of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in the Philippines) assisted by Rev. Fr. Ronnie Gicalao, OMI expanded the growth of local church and created innovations to increase enthusiasm among the lay faithfuls. In 2008‚Äì2009, Rev. Fr. Gil Asilo, OMI became the parish priest of Midsayap. From, 2009‚Äì2012, the large parish was under the team headed by Rev. Fr. Rogelio Tabuada, OMI with the support from Rev. Romeo C. Marcelino, OMI, Rev. Fr. Gil Asilo, OMI and Rev. Fr. Amador T. Castillo, OMI. From 2012 up to the present, as the ever-growing parish of Santo Ni√±o is preparing for the celebration of its 75th year of existence, the priests in charge of this very important missionary achievement of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate is led by Rev. Fr. Rizalde Oroloa, OMI and enjoyed the support of the younger oblates, Rev. Heriberto C. Villas, OMI and Rev. Mark F. Pagente, OMI. Highlights * Santo Ni√±o Parish is the favorite church for ordinations of the Oblates of Mary Immculate because of the parishioners strong support (both logistics and financial) for these occasions. * The parish was officially declared as an Archdiocesan Shrine of Santo Ni√±o de Midsayap last January 2013 enjoying the status of greater propagation and devotion for faithfuls and devotees from any place. * The parish has one of the most number of chapels covering most of the barangays of Midsayap and part of Northern Kabuntalan municipality in Maguindanao.

The first is the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, in the MRC Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality, administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint- Jean. Secondly, within La Tuque (urban agglomeration), Upper Mauricie, Quebec, Canada. This river is one of the five most important tributaries of the Saint- Maurice River.  Geography  Trenche river flows between the Saint-Maurice River and Croche River. One has many islands along the way. On his journey entirely in forest areas, Trenche river has many rapids and falls. The river widened at different places to form many lakes (Pegasus, \\"√† la Bo√Æte\\" (the box), Lauzon, \\"Du Chapeau\\" (the Hat), Tourouvre). Its mouth is located just southeast of Rapide-Blanc, on the left bank of the Saint-Maurice River in northern La Tuque (urban agglomeration). Its mouth flows into Tourouvre lake formed by the Trenche Dam. Main tributaries of the River Trenche: * Little River Trenche West (decimal coordinates: -72.91611, 48.29445) * Trenche East River (decimal coordinates: -72.91167, 48.26805) * South River Trenche (decimal coordinates: -73.22278, 48.47055) * Rivi√®re de la T√™te √† l'ours * Rivi√®re Raimbault  Toponymy  In 1829, Joseph Bouchette gives to this river the English name of ‚ÄúIce Chisel‚Äù or the noun ‚Äúslice ice‚Äù for cutting ice. This term from the English language in Canada means a tool whose purpose is to punch a hole in the ice. Such a hole can be used including fishing, trapping beaver or take the cup of ice to fill the coolers (ice warehouse for food storage in the hot season). The ice extent in the cooler between the layers of sawdust. The ice cutting increments is normally done in the coldest winter time on the rivers near homes, villages or cities. This practice can also be used to fill the coolers in forest remote sites. The tool ‚ÄúTranche‚Äù was used by trappers, travelers, hunters for their personal use or for barter practice with Aboriginal people. At the time of the fur trade at the beginning of British rule in Canada, the term ‚Äúchisel‚Äù and ‚Äúice chisel‚Äù was used by the English traders to designate this tool. Under the influence of Canadian wood runners (said \\"Courreurs de bois\\" in French) who worked for the company based in Montreal, caterers of Hudson Bay rather adopted the French term for this tool, rather than as ‚Äútrench‚Äù. The newspaper summarizing the two trips on the St. Maurice, made in 1889 by Father Napoleon Caron confirms the spelling ‚Äúrivi√®re Tranche‚Äù (River Edge)Source: Names and places of Quebec, the work of the Geographical Names Board, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of an illustrated dictionary printed, and in that of a CD produced by Micro - Intel in 1997 from this dictionary.

Following the publication of his book on these topics, Human Speech, in 1930, Paget worked for the remaining decades of his life on a new type of signing system for the deaf, which became the Paget Gorman Sign System. Early life and education Paget was born in 1869 at Cranmore Hall, Somerset. His father was Sir Richard Paget, 1st Baronet, a Conservative member of parliament; his mother was Caroline Isabel Surtees, the daughter of Henry Surtees, another MP, of County Durham. He was educated at Eton College, and then at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he received a third-class degree in chemistry. He succeeded his father as Paget Baronet in 1908.Harry Lowery, ‚ÄòPaget, Sir Richard Arthur Surtees, second baronet (1869‚Äì1955)‚Äô, rev. John Bosnell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008, accessed 5 January 2014. Legal career Paget was called to the bar as a barrister at the Inner Temple in 1895. His sharp legal and scientific mind saw him appointed to a number of legal commissions, boards and committees, including the London Court of Arbitration, the Patent Law Committee, and the Admiralty Board of Invention and Research. Amateur scientist Educated as a chemist and having worked as a physicist, Paget held a deep interest in various fields of science. He was also well-versed in music and the arts (and had written several songs as well as constructed his own musical instruments), but his reputation was that of an \\"eccentric amateur\\" scientist. Sir Richard's daughter, Pamela Paget (later Lady Glenconner), was often a subject of his experiments. Pamela's son and Sir Richard's grandson, Alexander Chancellor, wrote in his \\"Long Life\\" column in The Spectator that Pamela had broken her arm when Sir Richard encouraged her to throw herself backwards from the open platform of a London bus on Park Lane to demonstrate his theory that, due to air currents, one could fall horizontally from a bus travelling at a certain speed and land safely on the road. According to Lady Glenconner's obituary in The Telegraph, Sir Richard had also filled his daughters' ears with treacle (to simulate deafness) while testing his sign language system. =Speech and sign language= Sir Richard's most enduring legacy was his research into the nature of human speech and communication. While he made contributions to several branches of the field from phonetics and vocalisation to linguistics and vocabulary, it was his theories on the origin of speech and the \\"pantomimic action\\" of the lips and tongue being related to the speaker's senses and emotions that led to his central thesis that hand signs and gestures were the original form of human communication, and that humans had evolved to communicate vocally as their \\"hands [were] full\\".Peterson, Joseph: Human Speech: Some Observations, Experiments, and Conclusions as to the Nature, Origin, Purpose and Possible Improvement of Human Speech by Richard Paget, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 43, No. 4 (Oct. 1931), pp. 710‚Äì712. His book on these ideas, Human Speech, was published in 1930, and was re-issued in 1964 due to its connections with later developments in communication engineering. The Irish author James Joyce was a close follower of Paget's research, and his works and those of Marcel Jousse were influential in Joyce's study and use of language.Supplementing Babel: Paget in VI.B.32‚Äô, in James Joyce: The Study of Languages, ed. Dirk Van Hulle (Brussels: Peter Lang, 2002) (p. 75-89.) In the 1930s, Sir Richard began developing a manually coded sign language system. He collaborated with the librarian at the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, Pierre Gorman, to develop the system further. Upon his death in 1955, his widow, Lady Grace Paget, continued the work with Gorman, and the resulting Paget Gorman Sign System was widely used in the education of deaf children in Britain from the 1960s to the 1980s.Paget Gorman Signed Speech ‚Äì Our History, Paget Gorman Signed Speech. Marriage and children Paget was married twice. His first marriage was to Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon Finch-Hatton (daughter of Murray Finch-Hatton, 12th Earl of Winchilsea) on 31 May 1897; they had three daughters and two sons (one of whom died as an infant). His youngest child, John Starr Paget (1914‚Äì1992), succeeded him in the Paget Baronetcy as the 3rd Baronet.Sybil Oldfield, ‚ÄòPaget , Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon (1876‚Äì1938)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 5 January 2014.

It is located next to the Trier Dom. It is designated as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site. History A Roman double church originally stood here. The southern portion was torn down around 1200 and completely replaced by the Early Gothic Church of Our Lady (Liebfrauen). The exact date of the start of construction can no longer be determined, however a painted inscription inside on a column in the church reads: \\"The construction of this church was started in 1227 and ended in 1243\\" (German: \\"Der bau dieser Kirche ward angefangen im Jahr 1227 und geendigt im Jahr 1243\\") however, it is currently thought construction began in 1230 by Archbishop of Trier Theodoric II (also called Dietrich von Wied or Theoderich von Wied). Around 1260, the building was probably finished. In 1492, a high peak was placed on the central tower, which was named because of its high technology and degree of craftsmanship perfection. The high peak can be seen on the city dating, but was destroyed in a storm on Heimsuchungstag (July 2) in 1631. Subsequently a hipped roof emplaced, which was destroyed in the Second World War. It was first replaced in 1945 by a roof and then by a steeper one in 2003. On July 13, 1951, Pope Pius XII designated the church a Minor Basilica, and in 1986 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St. Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site. Architecture and structure Round Cruciform Floorplan A special feature of the basilica is its atypical cruciform floor plan as a round church, whose cross-shaped vaulting with four corresponding portals in rounded niches is completed by eight rounded altar niches so that the floor plan resembles a twelve-petaled rose, a symbol of the Virgin Mary, the rosa mystica, and reminiscent of the twelve tribes of Israel and the Twelve Apostles. The apostles as well as the twelve articles of the Apostle's Creed are painted on the twelve supporting columns, completely visible only from one spot marked by a gold star. Though nothing above the surface is Roman any longer, there are extensive excavations (not open to the public) underneath the church and several of the Gothic pillars stand on top of Roman column foundations.

Background Fite received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Tennessee. She received a master's degree from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Since 2000, Fite has been employed as a school psychology specialist by the public schools in Fort Smith. She was previously a special education teacher in Fort Smith except for one year in the middle 1990s in Pulaski County. A member of the First Baptist Church of Alma in Crawford County, Fite formerly served two terms as a board member of the Arkansas Baptist Executive Committee. She is a former officer of the Crawford County Republican Party. Political life Fite's husband, Thomas Lile \\"Tom\\" Fite, was the Republican legislative candidate in 2010 in the former District 83. His name was disqualified from the ballot by a judge in Pulaski County who declared that Fite's guilty plea in 1984 to Medicaid fraud constituted an \\"infamous crime.\\" Democratic Representative Leslee Milam Post hence won that election by default. Tom Fite's name remained on the ballot, but votes for him were not counted. In the 2012 Republican primary in the new District 80, Fite defeated Terry Bibbs, 1,106 (54.2 percent) to 936 (45.8 percent). She then topped Democrat Jack Norton in the general election, 6,173 (57.4) to 4,575 (42.6 percent). The District 80 seat was vacated by the Republican Linda Collins-Smith, who instead ran unsuccessfully for the Arkansas State Senate in District 19. Meanwhile, Leslee Post was unseated in District 82, to which she was transferred, by the Republican Bill Gossage of Ozark in Franklin County. Fite is a member of these House committee: (1) Advanced Communications and Information Technology, (2) Aging, Children and Youth, Legislative and Military Affairs, and (3) Judiciary. In 2013, Fite joined the required majority to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. She co-sponsored both of those measures. Fite supported related legislation to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. She voted for a proposed spending cap in the state budget, but the measure failed to gain approval by two votes in the House. She co-sponsored amended state income tax rates. She co-sponsored the bill to allow officials of religious institutions to carry concealed weapons. Fite backed similar legislation to permit university officials to carry concealed weapons. She co-sponsored legislation to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms in an emergency. Fite opposed legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. She voted for a law, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. She voted to prohibit the closure of public schools based on declining enrollments over a two-year period, but the measure was defeated.

Long considered a sacred cow of American defense spending, U.S. federal military bands have periodically faced the prospect of decreased allocations in military budgets in proposals occasionally floated by lawmakers of the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties. Defunding efforts have generally been opposed by military leadership, veteran's groups, and music educators, and have largely been unsuccessful and short-lived. Background A member of \\"Downrange\\" - a rock band composed of musicians from the U.S. Army Band - performs for U.S. troops in Iraq. Soldiers in Army bands can reconfigure from a ceremonial ensemble to smaller, genre- specific groups that provide live entertainment to troops in remote areas and combat theaters with cover songs of popular hits. The United States has a long tradition of military music; the U.S. Marine Band is the nation's oldest musical ensemble of any genre and military composers, such as John Philip Sousa, have left an indelible impact on the evolution of a distinct musical tradition in the United States. Today, the five branches of the United States armed forces maintain nearly 150 military bands (including active duty units, part-time reserve and National Guard bands, and bands made-up of volunteer service members), with annual spending on music ensembles in excess of $300 million. Military bands are considered a traditional component of military culture. They provide the required musical accompaniment to the military's public duties responsibilities, including state arrivals, state dinners, military funerals, guard mounting, change-of-command ceremonies, ship christenings, officer commissioning, promotions and medal ceremonies, and tattoos. Most great powers maintain robust bands programs within their national military establishment to support these missions. In the U.S. bands are also designed to supplement a branch's community relations efforts by projecting a positive image of the U.S. military through performances in parades and other local events. Finally, bands contribute to troop esprit de corps; most U.S. military bands maintain component ensembles with specialized instrumentation including vocalists, guitars, keyboards, and so forth, that allow them to bring live music to entertain deployed troops in idioms including rock, country-western, and jazz. =Arguments in support of spending= Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Studies, has observed that \\"military bands certainly serve a useful function for ceremonies and other important events,\\" going on to note that the money allocated for military music programs is an attractive political target but, ultimately, incidental within the context of the $700 billion U.S. defense budget. The 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing Band marches down New York's Fifth Avenue during the 2010 Columbus Day Parade. In 2007 the band was deployed to Iraq to provide security at a tactical air control center. Other have noted that military bands are a customary component of the military's public affairs and community relations efforts, the non-band budgets for which top $4.5 billion. Military bands provide free or low cost support to community organizations by appearing at non-profit events, patriotic observances, and community festivals. The U.S. Army contends that, outside the U.S., bands \\"serve as representatives of senior commanders in multinational operations or to the host-nation population.\\" One example cited by military officials is the use of \\"Mo Better Blues,\\" a blues rock band composed of musicians from the 1st Armored Division Band, to entertain Russian Army soldiers during a contentious joint deployment to Bosnia in 1996. At the time, a U.S. State Department liaison officer claimed the band did \\"more for U.S.-Russian relations in 90 minutes\\" than he had been able to do in 30 days. In addition, military musicians are required to support current congressional mandates. For instance, veterans are guaranteed, under federal law, military honors at death, which includes a graveside rendition of Taps by a bugler. However, current staffing levels make it impossible to provide buglers for all of the estimated 633,000 veterans who die each year in the United States, resulting in the use of portable stereos to play recordings of Taps at some funerals, a move that has drawn criticism from veterans advocates. Finally, some bands - including ten of the Marine Corps' 12 ensembles - have critical duties during wartime, when they are reconfigured as security platoons that can fulfill a variety of missions tasks, such as convoy escort or rear area defense; bands have recently been deployed for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (This is a situation similar to that of the Corps of Drums in British Army battalions, who have secondary responsibility as the battalion mortar platoon.) A more extreme, albeit atypical, example of the use of a band in a combat situation occurred during the Vietnam War when U.S. Army Major- General John Hay ordered the 1st Infantry Division band to march down a road held by the North Vietnamese Army while playing the Colonel Bogey March. NVA forces were, reportedly, so confused by the impromptu parade that they withdrew from the area, allowing American infantry to follow the band in and capture the road without firing a shot. =Arguments against spending= Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota who has focused much of her time in office working to eliminate bands, has stated that military bands do not enhance national security and are \\"excessive and a luxury the Pentagon and taxpayers can no longer afford.\\" Brian Bilbray, a Republican from California, has echoed McCollum's position stating that military bands are not essential to national defense. The conservative advocacy group Citizens Against Government Waste has also supported eliminating military bands, stating that, while cutting funding for bands would have only a nominal impact on government spending or budget efficiency, it is an important symbolic move so that members of congress can \\"be credible\\" when discussing more substantive cuts. =Ambivalent arguments= Musicologist David Hebert published a nuanced argument that drew attention to ‚Äúextremely admirable aspects to the role that bands play within the military context,‚Äù noting that US ‚ÄúMilitary bands provide much-needed relief to soldiers facing horrific stress‚Äù and ‚Äúemphasize such values as altruism and even international cooperation. Moreover, some soldiers depart military bands and enter civilian life having attained outstanding musical and leadership skills.‚Äù Hebert, David (2015) \\"Militarism and Music Education\\". Music Educators Journal, vol.101, no. 3, p.82. However, he also acknowledged the deep and detrimental impact of militarism in US society generally, concluding that overall ‚Äúmilitarism endangers music education‚Äù and military models are inappropriate for education of schoolchildren in a democracy,Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2016). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. London: Routledge Press while pointing to evidence that ‚ÄúIn the United States, we find an array of music education partnership projects with the military that would be unthinkable in many other countries‚Äù.Hebert, David (2015) \\"Militarism and Music Education\\". Music Educators Journal, vol.101, no. 3, p.79. History of debate Rep. Betty McCollum has been a leading opponent of military band spending. Calls for cuts to military music programs have periodically been used by politicians from the Democratic and Republican parties as a political \\"red meat\\" response to proposals for spending cuts in other areas. In 1992 Senator Sam Nunn - fighting to stop closures of U.S. military bases in his home state as part of the peace dividend - instead suggested elimination of military bands that support the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, and U.S. Air Force Academy. Nunn said that cadets and midshipmen should volunteer to form their own bands instead, which would save the U.S. up to $10 million. Representatives of service academies responded by explaining that, due to the unique nature of cadet life relative to student life at civilian universities, it would not be practical for volunteer ensembles to replace the academy bands. Also, because cadets and midshipmen are nominated by members of congress, rather than selected through more conventional application processes, there would have been no way for academies to vet the musical skills of incoming classes or guarantee there were enough musicians to be able to form the kind of properly instrumented ensembles necessary to support academy drill instruction. The proposal ultimately became stalled in a larger debate about trimming $1 billion from the Strategic Defense Initiative and did not move forward. In 2011 Rep. Betty McCollum, responding to a proposal she opposed that would curb funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, called for 40-percent of military band budgets to be slashed. McCollum's suggestion was decried by the Fleet Reserve Association and described by the National Association for Music Education as \\"potentially devastating.\\" The McCollum bill was initially defeated, but reintroduced by the congresswoman a second time, when it narrowly passed with bipartisan support. It was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Senate. In 2012, McCollum again attempted to defund military music programs by reintroducing her amendment. In an effort to preempt further action by McCollum, the U.S. Air Force proactively disbanded one-third of its regional bands and sharply cut the number of billets of two others. Other service branches have prepared and staffed proposals to follow suit.

He is known for bringing two long-abandoned treatments for pediatric epilepsy back into popular use. One, the ketogenic diet, is a carefully managed, high-fat diet plan that reduces the incidence of seizures in children during and after its use, and the other, the hemispherectomy, is a drastic surgical procedure in which part or all of one highly seizure-prone hemisphere of the brain is removed to alleviate severe epilepsy. Early life Freeman was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Florence (n√©e Kann) and Leon Freeman, and raised in Great Neck, New York. He graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts in 1950 and from Amherst College in 1954. Medical career Freeman received his M.D. from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and did his internship and residency there from 1958 to 1961. With a training fellowship from the National Institutes of Health, he trained in pediatric neurology under Dr. Sidney Carter at the Columbia University Medical Center from 1961 to 1964 and served at the U.S. Army's Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1964 to 1966. He was a faculty member at Stanford University from 1966 to 1969. In 1969, he returned to Johns Hopkins Hospital as the founding head of the Pediatric Neurology Service and head of the Hopkins Birth Defects Treatment Center, and assumed leadership of the pediatric epilepsy clinic in 1972. He served as the head of those divisions until 1990, becoming a full professor of pediatrics and neurology along the way, and in 1991 he became the first Lederer Professor of Pediatric Epilepsy at Hopkins and director of the Pediatric Epilepsy center, which was named in his honor. Freeman advocated for the use of two treatments for pediatric epilepsy that had gone unused for decades: the ketogenic diet and the hemispherectomy. The ketogenic diet is a very carefully controlled diet regimen that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates and has been shown to reduce epilepsy symptoms in children. It was developed in 1921 but fell into disuse when anticonvulsant drugs came into widespread use in the 1940s and -50s. When Freeman returned to Hopkins in 1969, the diet was being used on only a few patients. Freeman revived the diet for wider use on children for whom multiple medicines were ineffective. According to Guy McKhann, the founding director of the Hopkins Department of Neurology, Freeman effected the \\"resurrection\\" of the diet \\"virtually all by himself, against great skepticism and opposition.\\" In 1994, Freeman was contacted by Jim Abrahams, a movie director whose son, Charlie, was suffering from epilepsy that had not responded to anticonvulsants. Charlie's epilepsy was cured on the ketogenic diet, and the story of his cure was the inspiration for the film ...First Do No Harm. Abrahams founded The Charlie Foundation To Help Cure Pediatric Epilepsy, which is now known as The Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies. The hemispherectomy, the removal of part or all of one of the hemispheres of the brain, had also fallen almost completely out of use after its development in the 1920s, and it was reintroduced under Freeman when he returned to Hopkins. It was used when patients suffered from any of three conditions‚ÄîRasmussen's encephalitis, irregular brain development or stroke‚Äîand had failed to respond to less-drastic treatments. The technique was used and to some degree brought to public awareness by neurosurgeon Ben Carson in the 1980s. According to Carson, Freeman \\"helped work out many of the techniques and problems associated with the cerebral hemispherectomy.\\" Personal life Freeman and his wife Elaine (n√©e Kaplan) met in 1954 when she was an undergraduate at Goucher College and he a medical student at Johns Hopkins Medical School. They married in 1956 and both worked at Johns Hopkins for decades. They had two sons and one daughter: Andrew, Joshua and Jennifer. Awards Freeman received in 1993 the Lennox Award and in 2001 the Penry Award of the American Epilepsy Society (AES) as well as the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Epilepsy Foundation and the Hower Award of the Child Neurology Society in 2004.

It is based on Armitage Trail's 1929 novel The 13th Guest and is an updated version of the 1932 film The Thirteenth Guest. The film stars Helen Parrish as a young woman who returns to her grandfather's house 13 years after his passing to read his will as per his wishes. Plot When Marie Morgan (Helen Parrish) was eight years old, she attended a banquet held by her dying grandfather, who disliked everyone in his family except her. That day he instructed her to return to his house upon her twenty-first birthday to read his will alone. Marie arrives at the house, and although it has been vacant for 13 years, the lights and telephone both appear to be working. Marie thinks back to the day her grandfather told her about his will and recalls the seating arrangement. There were twelve guests in attendance, but a thirteenth place to her grandfather's right was empty. Marie presently decides to open the envelope containing the will. Inside is a sheet of paper with the numbers 13-13-13 written with nothing else. Someone suddenly enters the house and a gunshot is heard, and Marie screams. She next finds herself sitting at the dinner table in the same place as when she was eight, but the doctor pronounces her dead. Police Lt. Burke (Tim Ryan) and Private Investigator Johnny Smith (Dick Purcell) are put on the case, but it is soon revealed that Marie is still alive. Barksdale (Cyril Ring), Marie's attorney who sat to the left of her at the banquet, is found dead in the exact chair he sat in 13 years ago. The detectives conclude that the killer is targeting the guests by where they sat, and therefore the murderer must have been one of the 13 guests.

It is easily identified by its prominent whorls of imbricating plates surrounding the main wall plates. It is quite large, attaining 55 mm diameter. Catolasmus represents one of the relictual lineages of the basal balanomorph radiation.  Diagnosis and Discussion  The most obvious diagnostic feature in the field for Catolasmus is the accessory imbricating plates, which are numerous (up to ten whorls, and prominent, nearly covering the primary wall plates. Individual whorl plates are strongly symmetrically ribbed. There are eight primary wall plates, with the rostrolatus entering the sheath, and free from the adjacent rostrum. Wall plates are solid, with no internal ribbing, as in Balanus. The basis is calcareous, thin, and does not form interdigitations with the wall plates. Soft parts are not specifically diagnostic, except the labrum has no denticles or bristles.  Nomenclature  * Type species: Catophragmus pilsbryi Broch, 1922 ** Fixation: Original designation by Ross and Newman, 2001 * Type locality: Isla Taboga, Panama, * Holotype:  Habitat and Geography  Catolasmus pilsbryi is a lower littoral species found on the Pacific Coast of Panama and Costa Rica.

Its common names include blue-striped pipefish and blue-and- orange cleaner pipefish. The fish is found throughout much of the Indo-Pacific and tropical East Pacific. Taxonomy D. excisus as a species was named by Kaup in 1856. D. melanopleaura, named by Bleeker, is a synonym. The species was eventually split into subspecies, based on distribution. D. excisus abbreviatus was named by Dawson in 1981, D. excisus excisus, by Kaup in 1856, and D. excisus paulus, by Fritzche in 1980. D. excisus abbreviatus pertains only to the Red Sea subspecies. D. e. paulus is restricted to the Revillagigedo Islands in Mexico. Characteristics The species is distinguished by its bluish mid-lateral stripe contrasting an orange or reddish body. Furthermore, it has a fan-like tail. A caudal fin is present, which is rounded with a white outline, the inside mostly black. The fish's snout is elongated. Males and females of the species grow to an average of 7 cm. A male will have a series of bumps and hooks on the upper surface of its snout, while a female will have a smooth snout. Males mature around lengths of 31 mm. Distribution and habitat The species has a wide distribution. It can be found from the Persian Gulf to the coasts of Central America and South America. It has been found in the Indo-Pacific and Western Pacific, inhabiting reef crevices. The fish has been found in tidepools. Behavior The fish may inspect larger fish for parasites in a symbiotic relationship. Two males of the species may fight. They frequently hover in pairs, advertising their presence by swimming in an undulating motion above the substrate and bobbing up and down in the water column, this seems to be to attract larger fish to them to be cleaned and they have been observed picking parasites off moray eels. During mating, the females deposit eggs into the male's brooding pouch, which located on its underside. The pouch has a lining that supplies the eggs with oxygen as well as nutrients. =Diet= The blue-and-orange cleaner pipefish's diet includes zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and parasites from other fishes. Its tube-like snout is used to eat such creatures by taking in water rapidly. =In captivity= The species is considered peaceful, especially in pairs. Aquarium hobbyists have reported success in feeding the species frozen brine shrimp and mysis shrimp. In an aquarium, they may be found in shady areas during daytime. The species has been reported to breed in a tank.

Her real name was Annapurna Devi or Golap Sundari Devi.People in Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna She was also referred as \\"grief stricken Brahmani\\" in the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. She played a very important role in the early development of Sri Ramakrishna movement and stayed till her death in Udbodhan, the house where the Holy Mother stayed in Calcutta. She was popular as Golap Ma (translation: Mother Golap) among the devotees of the Ramakrishna Order. Early life Very little is known about the early life of Golap Ma, except that she was born in a Brahmin family in the Baghbazar area of North Calcutta probably in 1864. She was married and had a son and a daughter named Chandi. Chandi was married to Saurindra Mohan Tagore of the Tagore family in Pathuriaghata, Calcutta. However she lost her husband, only son and daughter Chandi in quick succession and was grief-stricken on account of her loss. She was brought to Sri Ramakrishna by Yogin Ma, who was her neighbour.Women disciples  Sri Ramakrishna's influence  She met Sri Ramakrishna in 1885 in a grief-stricken state. He assuaged her grief and introduced her to Sri Sarada Devi. She soon became an intimate companion of the latter. Women Saints of East and West, by swami Ghanananda, published by Vedanta Press, Hollywood, 1955 Sri Ramakrishna on one occasion visited the house of Golap Ma, on 28 July 1885, as recorded in the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, by M, translated by Swami Nikhilananda, published by Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, New York, 1942 Golap Ma was one of the major woman disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and could render him personal service in the form of carrying his food and cleaning his room. During Sri Ramakrishna's illness, she provided dedicated service to him as the constant companion of Sri Sarada Devi, first in Shyampukur and then in kashipur.  As companion of Sri Sarada Devi  After passing away of Sri Ramakrishna, Golap Ma accompanied Sri Sarada Devi to the holy places of Varanasi and Vrindavan. Afterwards she was one of the first to report the abject poverty of Sri Sarada Devi in Kamarpukur and was instrumental in bringing her to Calcutta in 1888. Sri Sarada Devi used to affectionately call her as \\"Vijaya\\" and Yogin Ma as \\"Jaya\\".Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, by Swami Gambhirananda, published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Madras, 1977 She stayed with Sarada Devi whenever the latter stayed in Calcutta and accompanied her to Puri and later to Rameswaram, Madras and other places in South India. Subsequently when the Udbodhan house was constructed for the Holy Mother, by Swami Saradananda, Golap Ma came to stay there permanently. She also traveled to Jayrambati, Sarada Devi's village. As constant companion of Sri Sarada Devi, Golap Ma used to perform many of the household chores and also served as a major point of interaction with her devotees. Sri Sarada Devi used to speak through her to some of the male devotees, including Swami Vivekananda. As a constant companion of Sarada Devi, she had the unique opportunity of seeing and interacting with her from a very close quarter and therefore was a major source of information on her life and activities.  Last years  She was kind and charitable and during her last years was preoccupied with her spiritual practices. Half of her income was spent for the charity to the poor and needy. Sarada Devi had said that \\"Golap has attained spiritual illumination through japam (repeating the name of God)\\". Her life was simple but austere. She was literate and could study the scriptures like Mahabharata and Bhagavat Gita After Sri Sarada Devi died on 21 July 1920, Golap Ma, together with Yogin Ma and Swami Saradananda became the spiritual mainstay for her devotees. She died on 19 December 1924.

The film stars Nargis Fakhri, Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles. Principal photography for the movie began on 30 May 2013, filming started on 5 July 2013 and was completed by 15 October. The film released on 4 April 2014 to mixed reviews from critics, though it became a box office success. It is a remake of the 2011 Telugu film Kandireega. Plot Across a college in Ooty, Sreenath Prasad aka 'Seenu' (Varun Dhawan) fails his final exam by two marks. Eager to get a degree, he kidnaps the professor's daughter during her wedding and demands his professor(Raju Kher) to give him two more marks in exchange for his daughter. Seenu accidentally lets go of her however while letting his parents into his house, and his plan fails. Although Seenu's father offers him a job at his shopping mall, Seenu plans to get a degree at Tift College in Bengaluru. He leaves Ooty on a train headed for Bengaluru. On the train, he beats up a gang harming a group of teenage girls. When Seenu arrives in Bengaluru, a friend of his who lives there reluctantly allows him to stay in his house. Once Seenu arrives in Tift College, he prays to Krishna (Salman Khan's voice) to concentrate on nothing but studies. However, once he finishes, he sees a girl named Sunaina Goradia (Ileana D'Cruz) and gets attracted to her. He tries to get her attention, but she ignores him constantly. She tells him that she has been forced into marrying a corrupt policeman named Angad Negi (Arunoday Singh) since he tricked her father into shooting Angad's sidekick and friend Peter's (Rajpal Yadav)arm. Angad's men chase Seenu until he beats up two of them and scares away the rest. Seenu goes to Angad to make a truce with him and leave Sunaina, but Angad (believing he cannot do it) gives Seenu a chance to try to woo Sunaina for up to three days. Seenu publicly tells Sunaina he loves her and tells her not to be afraid of Angad and his goons. She gains courage, scares off Angad's men, and falls in love with Seenu. Angad finds Seenu, finds out what happened, and attempts to shoot Seenu, but instead accidentally shoots Peter. The media quickly finds out and Angad gets suspended as a police officer. All seems well until Sunaina is kidnapped and taken away in a helicopter. Seenu learns from Angad that Sunaina will be taken to the mansion of Vikrant Singhal (Anupam Kher), one of Asia's most notorious gangsters. Vikrant's daughter, Ayesha Singhal (Nargis Fakhri), was on the Ooty to Bangalore train Seenu was in and was attracted by his impressive fighting skills. She told her father about the experience as well as her interest in marrying him. Angad and Peter told Vikrant's men that in order to get Seenu, they would have to take Sunaina to lure him to their place, forcing Seenu to marry Ayesha. In the second half of the film, Seenu goes to Vikrant's residence in Bangkok, Thailand. He tricks Vikrant and his friend and associate Karan Balli (Saurabh Shukla) into thinking that he wants to marry Ayesha. However, he requests that he is given ten days to get to know Ayesha before the wedding day, which Vikrant initially refuses until Ayesha tells her father to \\"do as Seenu says\\". Ayesha lets Sunaina wear any of her clothes because she has an \\"extra piece\\" for all of her clothing. Ayesha and Seenu spend the day together; later, Seenu tells Ayesha that she does not love him. When Angad and Peter come later, she then falls in love with Angad through a sheer coincidence. Seenu and Sunaina use Ayesha's love for Angad as a way of solving their problem. Sunaina wears identical clothes to Ayesha; as a result, Angad confuses Sunaina for Ayesha, making Ayesha believe that Angad loves her. The plan later fails, though, when Angad realizes this and tricks Ayesha once again into marrying Seenu. Angad is tricked by Seenu and Sunaina into kissing Ayesha, but Vikrant sees this and points his gun at Angad to shoot him, but Ayesha steps in between and stops him saying that she loves Angad. Seeing this, Angad realizes that Ayesha's love for him is true and that Ayesha is the right girl for him, not Sunaina and decides to marry Ayesha. Vikrant realizes his daughter loves Angad and reluctantly tells Seenu that Ayesha will marry Angad. Seenu pretends to have agonized but celebrates later. Ayesha marries Angad, and Vikrant convinces Sunaina (who is also pretending to hate Seenu) to marry Seenu, by saying that he took 10 days to hatch a plan to bring Ayesha and Angad together, not to get to know Ayesha (not realizing that this is true) Seenu and Sunaina are back together again and get married.

They might not have experimented much but have given us the classic Hindi film sound that has gone missing in today's times.\\" The Bollywood gave the soundtrack 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"The David Dhawan-Sajid-Wajid combo rocks on...! Only next time, Dhawan should let S-W be completely free to indulge in their own style ‚Äì that way, we will get the far higher musical level of Partner! That said, we must compliment the team for their mainstream masala musical magic!\\" Another 3 stars out of 5 was given by Joginder Tuteja from Rediff mentioning \\"The Main Tera Hero soundtrack has no dull moments. Songs like Palat and Besharmi keep the fun element intact right through.\\" Promotion The film's official trailer was released online on 23 January 2014 with presence of the main cast.

Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 20% based on 5 reviews, and an average rating of 5/10. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"On the whole, MAIN TERA HERO is a wild, wacky, madcap entertainer that has the unmistakable stamp of the master of entertainers ‚Äì David Dhawan. An over the top plot, humor quotient and performances are three aces the film stands on. The film should work well with admirers of typical Bollywood masalathons, also because Varun Dhawan pulls off the act with flamboyance and bowls you over with an uproarious act in this zany entertainer. Go, have fun and laugh out loud!\\" Srijana Mitra Das of Times of India gave the movie 3.5/5 stars saying, Main Tera Hero is a pav bhaji picture, quick, spicy, hot. It has the depth of a comic strip but it also has its neon-shaded fun. For those who want a light laugh, here's your boy. Paloma Sharma of Rediff gave the movie 3.5/5 stars, and wrote, Main Tera Hero rests almost solely on the bases of strong performances extracted by a tough taskmaster, director David Dhawan‚Äîwho makes a surprisingly clean film for the most part but doesn't seem to have been able to resist the temptation to indulge in a few less-than-tasteful jokes post- interval. The second half is primarily where the problem lies. The script dwindles slightly. Too many characters with too many subplots emerge, messing things up for a bit. Film Critic Subhash K. Jha gave the film 3 stars, saying \\"\\"Main Tera Hero\\" is a cleverly designed blues-chaser...While Varun Dhawan goes about the task of filling up the screen with his confident zest, David Dhawan ensures there is enough fuel to furnish the funnies with a furious tempo\\". Mohar Basu of Koimoi praised the film, stating that, \\"Main Tero Hero transports you into a world of fun that we have been kept devoid of from weeks. Quick witted, jocular and pricelessly silly, this film is a sure shot must watch.\\" She gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. Raedita Tandan of Filmfare rated the movie with 3 stars stating, \\"Main Tera Hero (MTH) is a textbook David Dhawan movie. This is the kind of low-brow humour you enjoy without pretensions. It's not great cinema but it is a paisa vasool comedy.\\" Sarita Tanwar of DNA gave the movie 3/5 stars and said, \\"Main Tera Hero is a light- hearted entertainer, under two hours long which moves along at a brisk pace. Tushar Hiranandani has penned a mad script that will reel you in as soon as the credits end. If the industry was looking for a replacement for Govinda, then there isn't a better option than Varun.\\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 2.5/5 stars and said that \\"Main Tera Hero is an action-packed romantic comedy that is peppered with vivacious performances, peppy musical set pieces, and a breezy and an unusual love triangle that eventually acquires an additional angle. The story, which is clearly only a pretext to hang the film's many gags on, delivers frantic twists and turns that strain credulity.\\" Zee News Aparna Mudi, rated the movie 2.5/5 stars, stating, \\"The cast of the movie have definitely been given leverage to play their characters with ease, and performances are good all around. They also seem to have had a lot of fun with the movie, especially Varun, as he looks adorable pulling faces and romancing the two lead heroines. Highly entertaining in the first half, 'Main Tera Hero' slumps in the second. The jokes are slightly in-your-face and fail to make you laugh at times.\\" Abhishek Gupta of India TV gave it 2.5 stars and wrote, \\"Twists and turns in the climax look forcibly inducted to give a feeling of suspense, though, it doesn't work at all. The cop and the Don turning into comic characters were expected from it but despite all these hiccups, Main Tera Hero reaches its destination.\\" The Hindustan Times Anupama Chopra gave the film 2 stars, saying, \\"There are a few moments in the film that took me back to the good old day. But mostly, Main Tera Hero is loud and tiring. The frenzied plot didn't deliver enough funny lines. The burden of making this enterprise work rests mostly with Varun, who is as hyper as a helium-filled energizer bunny. Meanwhile, the two svelte heroines ‚Äì Ileana D'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri ‚Äì simper about looking sexy. I just wish it had been more interesting\\". India Today gave the film 2 stars: \\"If this film was made to establish Varun Dhawan as a comedy actor who can do something different then they have achieved what they wanted. Because he does put a great show together but there is absolutely nothing else that deserves any compliments.\\" Box office Main Tera Hero opened to an occupancy of around 40% in India. The film, which released alongside Captain America: The Winter Soldier, led in the morning shows in places like Rajasthan, Gujarat and CI while lost out to it in multiplexes of Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai. The film saw a major setback during evening shows in the first day of its release owing to the semi-final match between India and South-Africa collecting .

Located on the city's main Khreshchatyk Street, its fa√ßade faces the central Maidan Nezalezhnosti square and contains the city's main clock tower. The building was built in place of the Noble Assembly building that stood in its place during 1851‚Äì1976 and even survived World War II. On February, 19, the building burned down and demolished almost completely during the riots of Revolution of 2014. History Maidan Nezalezhnosti's northern half is a unique layout that's topped with a semi-circle with six radial roads. After the destruction of several Khrestchatyk buildings (such as Kyiv City Duma building, Ginzburg building and others) by the Soviet diversion groupsIn Kiev, remembered the destruction of Khreschatyk 70 years ago (+ German archival VIDEO). Ukrayinska Pravda. 26 September 2011. during World War II on 24 September 1941, the square was completely rebuilt in the mid 1950s in a project presided over by architect Alexander Dobrovolsky, in a style to resemble the dominant revival architecture trend, known as Stalinist baroque. In 1956 Moscow issued a decree that challenged the use of excessive decorations in architecture, which stopped existing work before the project could be finished leaving the square with obvious asymmetry, with only the western part completed. After nearly two decades of such visual dissemblance, in 1974 the XXVth Kyiv's city conference gave a go-ahead to re-develop the city centre and finish the ensemble. The Ukrainian Republican Soviet of Trade Unions (predecessor to the current Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine) was awarded this prize spot in a draw, and was to sponsor the construction that was carried out by the Kyivmiskbud-4 trust. The building's project, work of Kyivan-native architects Oleksandr Malynovsky and Oleksandr Komarovsky, was a very fine crafted design. This was because it had to match the imposing Kyiv Post Office building opposite not only in proportions, but in such a style that would blend in with the milieu, yet be visibly a modern structure. One feature that punctuated the latter, was a 24-metre tower with four 7.2 x 4.3 metre screens displaying the current time, temperature, date and other information. This became the official clock tower of Ukraine, and chimed the famous melody Yak tebe ne lyubyty, Kyyeve miy. In 2011 the tower was renovated and the screens, being a matrix of almost five thousand 127-Volt, 40 W light bulbs were replaced by diode matrices, providing multi-colour digital image with much greater resolution. Most of the building was used as offices by the Trade Unions federation, however it contains several auditoriums and banquet rooms that allowed it to be used as a permanent multi-purpose venue. =Euromaidan HQ= During the late 2013 to early 2014 Euromaidan protest campaigns, the Budynok Profspilok was occupied by protesters and turned into their main center housing political headquarters, the press center, security center and the main kitchen. A number of important Euromaidan events, including recurrent attacks and provocations by police, occurred in and around the building. The building was completely burnt down during the night of 18‚Äì19 February, the day before the mass sniping fire took place during the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution.

It was designed by Fran√ßois Baillairg√© and built in from 1818 to 1930. It is situated on Rue Dauphine in Old Quebec close to the ramparts of Quebec City. History=Foundation= After the suppression of the Jesuits on 21 July 1773, the Bishop of Quebec Jean-Olivier Briand allowed the Jesuits to remain Quebec. However, the government refused to allow the Jesuits to have any new members and would not allow any new French priests to come to Canada. This meant that the number of Jesuits reduced as their members died. The last Canadian Jesuit, Fr. Jean-Joseph Casot, died at Quebec in 1800.Jesuits from The Canadian Encyclopedia, retrieved 19 May 2015 Since the Jesuits were no longer present in Quebec, the Jesuit College, Quebec was run by the Notre- Dame-de-Qu√©bec Congregation. On 9 November 1817, they received approval from Archbishop Joseph-Octave Plessis to build a new chapel. =Construction= The chapel was designed by Fran√ßois Baillairg√©. It was built on the former grounds of the Jesuit College. Construction started in 1818 and completed in 1820. It was expanded in 1857, and a new facade was added in 1930. The main altar was built in 1888 by Eug√®ne Tach√© and the windows were created in 1916 by Bernard Leonard. Initially, the chapel was served by priests from the Notre-Dame Basilica-Cathedral In 1842, the Jesuits returned to Quebec. In 1856, the Jesuits moved into a house near to the chapel. In 1907, the chapel was given over to the Jesuits. In 1949, the chancel was altered and statues and relics of the Canadian Martyrs were installed. The chapel was then dedicated to the Canadian Martyrs. In 1992, the Maison Dauphine, a centre for homeless youth, was established next to the chapel. In the 2010s, this closed and a new charity was established on the ground floor, below the chapel. It is called Carrefour d'Action Interculturelle and works to improve the standard of living of migrants when they arrive in Quebec.

The day saw the highest numbers of journalists injured by police in a single event since Ukraine's independence regain in 1991. Also, 1 December became the first instance of a public building being occupied by protesters in modern history of the country. 30 November attack on protesters Ukrainian nationalist movement flown on 29 November in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) before the attack Police attacks protesters on 29 November (15:35 LST) On the night of 30 November 2013 at 04:00, armed with batons, stun grenades, and tear gas, Berkut special police units attacked and dispersed all protesters from Maidan Nezalezhnosti while suppressing mobile phone communications. The police attacked not only the protesters (most of whom didn't or failed to put up resistance) but also other civilians in the vicinity of Maidan Nezalezhnosti, when the Berkut forces chased unarmed people several hundreds of meters and continued to beat them with batons and feet. Initially, 35 people were injured as a result of the militia raid, including a Reuters cameraman and a photographer. Other protesters were detained. Most of the protesters were students. At 09:20 Berkut besieged the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery where approximately 50 Euromaidan activists, including the injured, found sanctuary. Police spokeswoman Olha Bilyk justified the police raid by saying that protesters were interfering with preparations to decorate the square for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, and accused them of throwing stones and burning logs. Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaliy Zakharchenko later apologized and claimed \\"riot police abused their power\\" and promised a thorough investigation. Via state television he added \\"if there are calls for mass disturbances, then we will react to this harshly\\". In an official statement, Ukrainian Deputy Prosecutor General Anatoliy Pryshko confirmed that 79 people were injured during the raid, including 6 students, 4 reporters, and 2 foreigners; 10 people were hospitalized. In addition, 7 policemen were also injured. On 30 November 2013 by 13:00 another spontaneous meeting was taking place at St. Michael's Square near the St. Michael's Monastery as Maidan Nezalezhnosti continued to be guarded by the Berkut formations. Ambassadors from some ten countries of the European Union, among which was the Ambassador of the European Union in Ukraine, Jan Tombi≈Ñski, visited protesters at the meeting. According to Hromadske.TV, by 16:00 the meeting gathered some 5,000 people who were shouting \\"Won't forgive\\", and \\"Revolution\\". At St. Michael Square protesters started to form units of self-resistance. Approximately 10,000 protesters remained in the evening of the 30th, with an estimated 10,000 more from Lviv travelling to Kyiv on Saturday night. On 30 November opposition parties Batkivshchyna, UDAR and Svoboda set up \\"Headquarters of National Resistance\\" throughout Ukraine. 1 December riots Violent clashes erupt between protesters and police On 1 December, Kyiv's District Administrative Court banned further protests in downtown Kyiv at both Maidan Nezalezhnosti and European Square, as well as in front of the Presidential Administration and Interior Ministry buildings, until 7 January 2014. Opposition forces planned the rally on the 1st to take place at St. Michael's Square, which is not among the banned rally locations, with a march towards Maidan Nezalezhnosti. During 1 December rally, protesters followed through and defied the ban and marched form St. Michael's Square to re-take Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Protesters broke several windows in the city council building, followed by crowds spilling out of Maidan Nezalezhnosti to the Presidential Administration building at Bankova Street and the Cabinet building (Hrushevskoho Street). People chanted \\"Out with the thugs\\" and sang the Ukrainian anthem. The opposition party Batkivshchyna claimed as much as 500,000 protesters turned out for the rallies, and opposition leader Petro Poroshenko claimed 350,000 were on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Other news agencies reported over 100,000 in Maidan Nezalezhnosti alone, and the total number of protesters to be from 400,000 to 800,000. One poll had 70% of the surge in protesters attributable to the violence of 30 November. At around 14:00, a group of protesters commandeered a bulldozer (LongGong CDM 833) from Maidan Nezalezhnosti and attempted to pull down the fence surrounding the Presidential Administration building. People threw bricks at Internal Troops guards. At least three people were injured outside of the presidential administration building, receiving head injuries from flying debris. AFP reporters saw security forces outside the Presidential Administration building fire dozens of stun grenades and smoke bombs at masked demonstrators who were pelting police with stones and Molotov cocktails.

Writer Irena Karpa also encouraged the nation to go on general strike ‚Äì to skip work, boycott Russian products and continue the protests. Opposition leaders stated that Yanukovych is planning on declaring a state of emergency on 2 December. Klitschko denounced the attempt to storm the president's office as an effort to provoke the government into declaring a state of emergency. He called for everyone to stay on the square in a peaceful protest. He later called for the president's resignation, stating \\"They stole the dream. If this government does not want to fulfill the will of the people, then there will be no such government, there will be no such president. There will be a new government and a new president,\\" he said to cheering crowds. Meanwhile, Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok called for a national strike and in an official release called for a \\"social and national revolution,\\" saying a revolution has started in Ukraine. Opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko also called for a revolution to take place, saying \\"Our plan is clear: this is not a rally, not an action. This ‚Äì is a revolution,\\" and called to complete the revolutions which took place in 1991 and 2004.

She worked on and later copied portraits made by her father, Gilbert Stuart, and created her own portraits. In the early 19th-century, she assumed the responsibility of supporting her family after her father's death. She first worked in Boston, but later moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where she was the first woman who painted portraits. In 2011, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. Early life Jane Stuart, Gilbert Stuart, Gilbert Stuart Birthplace and Museum. Another portrait, , she made of her father is held at the Rhode Island Historical Society. Jane Stuart, born in 1812 in Boston, Massachusetts, was the youngest child of renowned painter Gilbert Stuart and Charlotte Coates Stuart, who was 13 years his junior and \\"exceedingly pretty\\". They were married about September 1786. The Stuarts had twelve children, five of whom died by 1815 and two others died while they were young, perhaps born after Jane. The known names of the children include Charles Gilbert, Jarvis, Emma, Elizabeth, Anne, Carlisle, Agnes Blagrove, and Jane. Charles had artistic and dramatic talent, Elizabeth was a published writer, and Carlisle was noted for his agreeable disposition and died in 1820, possibly from tuberculosis. Anne lived to 68 years of age, and Elizabeth married a man named Benjamin Stebbins. There were no descendants from the family. Gilbert Stuart had mental illness for years, but was able to keep it hidden. The children had aspects of a traditional childhood, playing musical instruments and telling stories, but also were subject to a life of emotional turmoil. Career=Early years and education= Gilbert Stuart believed that true talent did not need instruction, so he did not give his daughter lessons. Instead, Jane learned painting skills by watching him and copying his style, and through lessons by instructors or her brother Charles. She was kept busy by her father grinding paints and filling in backgrounds of his paintings. Stuart later said that she would have preferred it if her father had given her training. She completed many of her father's partially finished paintings and made her own paintings. Affectionately called \\"boy\\" by her father, she was considered by him to be a better painter than he was at the same age. He wanted to but was unable to, send her to London to study with George Downey. About 1820, she made a portrait of George Washington. It is held at the Kemper Art Museum of the Washington University in St. Louis. Her father died in 1828. He was not good at managing money and when he died, his family was left in extreme poverty. The Boston Athen√¶um held a benefit exhibition of 250 his works in August 1828 in an effort to provide financial aid for the family. Stuart opened a studio in Boston and began working as an artist to support her family. Three of her siblings‚ÄîElizabeth, Emma and an unnamed brother‚Äîwere committed to psychiatric hospitals following her father's death. =Established career= After 1828, she received commissions to make dozens of miniature and full-sized paintings after the popular works created by her father, especially replicas of her father's portraits of President George Washington (1732‚Äì1799). Her painting of Washington, patterned after one made by her father, exhibited her skill as an artist, capturing light and depicting facial features and expression. Her paintings were so skillful that the paintings have been confused with the originals by art dealers. She also made paintings after other artists. She exhibited her works at the Boston Athen√¶um beginning in 1827 and often exhibited her works there and at the National Academy Museum and School in New York City until 1870. Aside from copying works of others, she also created her own portraits and paintings, which reflected her personal style. She was said to be among the city's best portrait painters based upon her exhibit at the Academy of Fine Arts. She studied painting in New York. In 1833 she exhibited at the New York Academy of Fine Arts. Besides earning money as a painter, Stuart was also an art teacher. In 1834, she painted Scene from a Novel or a Subject from Literature, now owned by Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. She lived in New York between 1840 and 1842, and exhibited her works at the American Academy. She and her father both worked on a portrait of Oliver Hazard Perry that is held at the Toledo Museum of Art. The museum stated that \\"Gilbert Stuart was notorious for leaving paintings unfinished and completed only the head. His talented 16-year-old daughter Jane finished the sky, body, and uniform after her father‚Äôs death.\\" Her painting A Portrait of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry belonged to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island until 1980. It was among nine portraits of prominent Rhode Island men that were given in 1857 to the university. It is now among the collection of the Birmingham Museum of Art. She continued to paint from the 1850s, including making paintings from daguerreotypes. Over her career, she also made religious and genre paintings. Some of her paintings are Lady Macbeth that has been among the collection of the Morris Museum; The Fortune Teller; Morning, Noon and Night that has been held by the New Britain Museum of American Art, and Costume of Charles the Second's Reign (1876). Her portraits from this period include Alicia Boylston in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and one of her portraits of George Washington, which is held at the Harvard Art Museums. A portrait by her of Thomas Jefferson is at the Strawbery Banke Museum in Portsmouth, NH. Stuart wrote three articles about her father for Scribner's Monthly between June 1876 and July 1877. She struggled financially, but kept up appearances during the Gilded Age of Newport by selling her father's or her paintings to by-passers. Personal life Stuart remained unmarried throughout her life, but was a matchmaker for others. She was a noted socialite, known for her \\"droll wit and fascinating personality\\", like that of her father. Intelligent and playful, she enjoyed dressing up in costumes and playing charades. Three of her siblings‚ÄîElizabeth, Emma and an unnamed brother‚Äîwere committed to psychiatric hospitals following her father's death. In 1831, the family moved to Newport, Rhode Island, while she also continued to have a studio in Boston. At this time, she supported her mother and three sisters. Her mother died in 1847 at 77 years of age. In August 1858, many of her paintings were destroyed when her studio burned. She then established a studio in her family home in Newport, Rhode Island. She acquired the house at 86 Mill Street in Newport in 1863. After a brief illness, she died on April 27, 1888. She is buried at a family monument at the Common Burying Ground in Newport, Rhode Island. Legacy Noted as the first woman portraitist of Newport, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2011. Some of her works are among the collection of the Gilbert Stuart Museum. An exhibit of her and her father's original works was held at the Gilbert Stuart Museum in Saunderstown, Rhode Island from June to October 2016. Her works included in the exhibition included two portraits she made of her father, and portraits of George and Martha Washington. Her artists file and photographs of her works‚Äîacquired from curators, art galleries, and dealers‚Äîare held at the Photograph Archives of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Library of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and United States.

She was a lecturer at the Royal Academy and regularly exhibited her works, including the summer Royal Academy exhibitions. She was commissioned to make portraits by Lincoln College and St Hilda's College, Oxford. Her works are in the National Gallery, Tate and the Royal Academy collections. In the early years of her marriage, she signed her works Jean Bratby. Early life Jean Esme Oregon Cooke was born on 18 February 1927 in South London to Arthur Oregon Cooke and his wife. Arthur owned a shop in Blackheath, London where he sold hardware supplies and groceries. Until she was about 6 1/2 years old, Cooke spent a lot of time in her father's shop. Her mother saw little value in education and kept her out of school until then. Her mother had an artistic spirit, creating \\"beautiful colours to decorate the walls by subtly mixing odd touches of paint.\\" As a young girl she drew, painted and modeled figures and heads in plasticine. She attended Blackheath High School. Early adulthood Cooke began her art studies in 1943 at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She studied life drawing under Bernard Meninsky, textile design, and illustration at the Central School until 1945. Cooke then studied sculpture at Goldsmiths College and pottery at Camberwell College of Arts. Interested in becoming a teacher, she enrolled in the teacher education course at Goldsmiths, which she completed in 1950. Initially, Cooke was most interested in pursuing sculpture, partly because oils were expensive and clay was free at the college. One of her works won a prize, but after suffering a biking accident where she had dislocated her thumb, she worked in pottery. In 1950 she established a pottery workshop in Sussex. John Bratby, a Royal College of Art painter, and Cooke began a tempestuous dating relationship. Bratby, afraid that she might leave him, locked her in his room once during their courtship. In April 1953 they were married and she took his last name. Later that year she entered the Royal College's post graduate program. Cooke's interest in painting grew under the tutelage of Ruskin Spear, Rodrigo Moynihan, and Carel Weight. In 1964 she had her first solo exhibition at Leicester Galleries. She developed a following, including Bethel Solomons and Brinsley Ford who collected her regularly exhibited works. Bratby did not achieve the recognition that his wife received and he was upset by it, which made their relationship increasingly difficult. He often painted over or \\"slashed\\" her works and restricted her painting time to three morning hours. Bratby had affairs and was physically abusive and cruel. He was said, though, to have had an \\"enlivening, inspiring effect\\" on her artistically. Career In 1964 she began teaching students to paint at the Royal College. The following year the Royal Academy made her an associate member and in 1972 she was made a full member. She lectured at the college until 1974. During the summers she exhibited her works at the Royal Academy exhibition. The seascape at her cottage and the landscape surrounding her Edwardian mansion featured in her paintings: \\"cherry trees in full bloom, long grass filled with buttercups and blue-flowering lungwort, or the dark evergreens lit by the house windows at night. Doves were favourite models and appeared frequently.\\" She made self-portraits, paintings of her husband; and portraits. She was commissioned by St Hilda's College, Oxford to paint its principal, Mary Bennett and was hired by Lincoln College to make portraits of Walter Oakeshott and Egon Wellesz. In the early 1980s she painted a full- length portrait of her next-door neighbor, the baroque cellist Richard Webb. Her works reflected sensitivity, beauty, and insight - made with a \\"subtle, understated, individual sense of colour.\\" Piet Mondrian was one of her favourite artists. Her work has been compared to Gwen John and Paula Modersohn-Becker. Cooke made several self-portraits, like Blast Bodicea, Jamais je ne pleure et jamais je ne ris (I never cry and I never laugh), and Self-Portrait (Tate). Her self-portraits often reflected humour to counterbalance the candid and not particularly flattering works. In them she was always searching for something, \\"the previously unperceived.\\" Cooke commented that she had different motivations, sometimes wanting to be alone, or to be acknowledge, or to show off. Blast Bodicea was made at the urging of her husband, John Bratby, who had given her a heavy brass fireman's helmet to be included in the work. Although it became too difficult to paint while wearing the helmet, there are faint traces of the helmet visible in the painting. Bratby and Cooke's relationship experienced cycles of violence throughout their marriage. Jean left their home in fear, but would return based on the advice of their mentor and family friend, Carel Weight. She began signing her works with her maiden name at Bratby's insistence. The couple had one daughter, Wendy, and three sons, Dayan, David, Jason. They were all artistic. The family shared their time between two houses. One was a seaside cottage at Birling Gap and the other was a large, cold Edwardian manor, which had tennis courts, a swimming pool and a largely untended garden. The couple's relationship was over by the 1970s, and they divorced in 1977. Starting in 1974 Cooke held \\"open studios\\" for the Greenwich Festival, something she continued until 1994. Her works are at the National Gallery, Tate and the Royal Academy. Later years In 2003, her house caught fire, many of her paintings were lost, and the building was destroyed. She moved into a Charlton Village flat and continued her painting there. She died on 6 August 2008 at her second cottage at Birling Gap while looking at the sea out of her window. The cause of death was pneumonia. Andrew Lambirth wrote of her in the days following her death: Friend and playwright Nell Dunn wrote that she had \\"a crazy sense of humour - she sees herself as a comic character in a comic world, with the only serious thing being painting.\\" Professional organisations Cooke became a Full Royal Academician in 1972, and for many years her work has appeared annually in the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition. She was on the Council of the Royal Academy in 1983 to 1985, 1992 to 94, and 2001 to 2002. In 1993 and 1994, she was a Senior hanger at the Royal Academy. From 1984 to 1986, Cooke was governor of the Central School of Art and Design. She sat on the academic board of the Blackheath School of Art from 1986 to 1988. She was a member of the Friends of Woodlands Art Gallery.

He is one of the Punokawan, four comedic figures common in the medium. Depiction Petruk is one of the four Punokawan, together with Semar (the leader/father figure), Bagong, and Gareng; Petruk acts as the middle child. They are portrayed living together as a harmonious family. The Punokawan, often referred to as clowns in English, provide comic relief in the stories they are in, but also serve to speak to the audience and convey ideas of the dhalang (puppeteer), including social criticism. Petruk is depicted as having lengthy limbs and a long nose; his nose is generally considered his most distinctive feature. In wayang performances the dhalang generally provides a \\"warrior's voice\\" for Petruk, as opposed to the nasal voice used for his brothers. He is married to Dewi Ambarawati, whom he won the right to marry after defeating four other suitors in a vicious battle. Together they have a son, Lengkungkusuma. Literary appearances Petruk and the punokawan, who are not present in the original Indian versions of the Mahabharata, are thought to have been an original Javanese creation. The Batara Ismaya Krama details Petruk's origin as follows. He was originally a noble raksasa known as Bambang Pecruk Panyukilan. He was humorous yet quick to fight, enjoyed joking but a furious warrior. One day, he departed his home to test his strength. Meeting Bambang Sukakadi, he challenged the latter to fight. The two fought for an extended period of time, until ultimately their entire bodies were covered in bruises and both had lost their once-handsome appearances. The fight was only stopped after Bagong and Smarasanta came together with Semar; Semar ordered the fighting men to stop and join him as his students. Afterwards Bambang Pecruk Panyukilan became Petruk, whereas Bambang Sukakadi became Gareng. During the Dutch colonial period, a wayang story entitled Petruk Dadi Ratu (Petruk Becomes King) arose as a veiled criticism of the Dutch colonial powers. In this story, Petruk (in the guise of Prabu Welgeduwelbeh) overthrows his brother Gareng to become king of Trancanggribig; he is ultimately overthrown by Bagong, until the kingdom is surrendered to the Pandawa. Other contemporary stories exist as well. In Petruk Ilang Petele (Petruk Loses His Axe), Petruk loses his axe, whereas in Ambangun Candi Saptaharga a woman named Dewi Mustakaweni steals a sacred relic known as Kalimasada, after which Petruk steals it back. Petruk and the Punokawan can also be found in modern Indonesian literature. In Nano Riantiarno's Semar Gugat (1995), for instance, Petruk appears as a son of Semar who abandons him after the latter loses his powers. Allusions to the character can be found in cartoons.

His project Transitions Organ Duo, a Hammond/Drum duo with Dutch organist John Hondorp, does not only continue work with renowned guest soloists.

He visited and lived in London, Dublin and Brussels and interviewed important jazz personalities, such as the heads of the jazz departments at the conservatoires (e.g. the royal academy of music and the guildhall London) or club managers. These interviews as well as various concerts and lessons he took during this research gave him an understanding of the various (jazz)music outcomes and structures on jazz across Europe. He was always able to keep connections made during this time active, which for example resulted in Markus being interviewed by Linley Hamilton of BBC radio. They talked about the Transitions Organ Duo as well as Markus‚Äôs research activities. Some tracks of Transitions were played.

The five-nation competition was held in February 1913 in Saint-Moritz, Switzerland. Winner of the tournament was Germany.  Participating teams  *25px Bohemia 25px Germany *  Background  Modern bandy originated in England and the first rules were published in 1882. It soon became a popular sport in several Central and Northern European countries as well as in Russia. From 1901 bandy was played in the Scandinavian Nordic Games,Nordiska Spelen Bandytips (Swedish). Retrieved 6 January 2014. which was the first international multi-sport event focused on winter sports. The rules differed between countries. Most popular was the 7 vs 7 game but Sweden, Finland and Russia preferred the 11 vs 11 rules. In some countries, like Latvia, bandy was played 9 vs 9. The 1913 European Championships were arranged by the International Ice Hockey Federation established in 1908. Matches were played with 7-men teams. The number of participating teams was five. Since Sweden and Russia followed the rules of 11-men teams, they rejected the invitation and competed in the 1913 Nordic Games in Stockholm. The German team consisted mostly of the members of Leipziger-HK, which was supposed to play in Stockholm as well. but as many of its players were selected for the German national team, they decided to travel to Saint-Moritz.Bandy World Map Bandytips. Retrieved 6 January 2014.  Aftermath  The 1913 tournament was the peak for bandy in all of the participating nations, as the outburst of World War I put an end to the international competitions. After the war was over, International Olympic Committee included ice hockey to the 1920 Summer Olympics instead of bandy. This was because bandy was totally unknown in North America and because Antwerp had an ice hockey-sized indoor arena. The IOC decision caused the decline of bandy in Central Europe and Great Britain as the bandy players switched to ice hockey. After the 1920s, bandy was only played in the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia and three of the Nordic countries. In the 1930s, bandy also disappeared from Estonia and Latvia (it made a return there when they no longer were independent countries, but Soviet Republics). It was completely or almost forgotten in England, Italy, France, Switzerland and Belgium, which all took part at the 1913 European Championships. Austria, Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in 1913 a part of Austria-Hungary) were countries where bandy survived longer, well into the 1920s.  Revivals  On 6 January 2014, the Federation of International Bandy arranged a four nation tournament in Davos to celebrate the anniversary of the 1913 European Championship. Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Netherlands played at the same venue as 101 years ago. The Dutch won this unofficial European Championship. In 2016, a somewhat smaller tournament dubbed the Davos Cup was held with national teams from three European countries. This was won by Estonia.

Life Miller was reputedly born London, from a Scottish background. He was a pupil of John Faber the younger, and the earliest date on his own plates is 1737. After working for some years in London, Miller went to Dublin and settled there. He was invited to do so by John Brooks and they initially worked together, trying to break a London monopoly on mezzotint engraving. Together they had a strong group of pupils‚ÄîJames McArdell, Richard Houston, Richard Purcell, and Charles Spooner‚Äîand the main burden of training them may have been Miller's. In 1746 the \\"Dublin group\\" broke up, with Brooks returning to England in company with McArdell and Houston. Miller's Dublin plates, which are dated from 1743 to 1756, were mostly published by himself \\"on Hog Hill, near the Round Church\\", and some bear also the address of Michael Ford. Miller is said to have shortened his life by drinking. He died in Dublin in September 1763. Works Miller's portraits numbered more than 60. They included: * Jonathan Swift, after Francis Bindon (1743); * Robert Boyle, after Johann Kerseboom; * Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, after William Hoare; * Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, after Thomas Hudson; * Queen Elizabeth I; * David Garrick as Richard III, after William Hogarth; * John Hampden; * Archbishop William King, after Charles Jervas; * John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, after Godfrey Kneller; * Joe Miller as Teague, after Charles Stoppelaer; * Archbishop James Ussher, after Peter Lely; * John Warburton, after Benjamin Vandergucht;National Portrait Gallery, John Warburton by Andrew Miller. and * George Whitefield, after M.

In late 1649 the government reacted, and Miller spent some time in Newgate Prison. Some of Miller's portraits are copies of prints by Jacobus Houbraken, George Vertue, and others: he was known for plagiarism.
