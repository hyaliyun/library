History He was the son of Encagilio. Already a tribune during the dogeship of Giovanni Galbaio, he and other Venetian pro-Frankish leaders fled to Treviso. There they elected Obelerio their leader and he led them back to Venice, whence the Galbaii fled, and was elected doge at Malamocco. Obelerio immediately copied his predecessors and appointed as associate doge one of his relatives, his brother Beato. Soon the Antenori were out of favour and the feud between the various factions, the pro-Byzantine at Heraclea and the republican at Malamocco, had fired up. The exiled patriarch of Grado, Fortunatus, returned to Venice from the court of Charlemagne at Aachen and offered to put Venetia under the protection of the Franks if he was reinstated. Obelerio obliged him and happily recognised Frankish sovereignty in return for Frankish protection and legitimation. Obelerio and Beato did homage to Charlemagne in Aachen on Christmas Day 805. Obelerio even chose a Frankish bride: Carola, the first '. This act precipitated a war with Byzantium. In 809, a fleet landed in the Venetian lagoon and attacked a Frankish flotilla at Comacchio but was defeated. Obelerio and Beato then raised their other brother Valentino to the dogeship alongside them. This was the last straw and the people rose against them; they called in King Pepin of Italy. He besieged Venice, but only at the last minute did the Antenori try to save face by taking up arms against him. They were booted and Agnello Participazio, who had defended Venice from the beginning, was elected doge. Obelerio spent the next two decades in exile in Constantinople. He returned on the death of Giustiniano Participazio in 832 with a band of faithful men to reclaim the dogeship. He landed at Vigilia, near Malamocco, but the legitimate doge, Giovanni Participazio, razed the two cities and killed Obelerio, displaying his head in the market. Sources * Norwich, John Julius.

The book was released on February 14, 1998 and co-authored by Neil Strauss. Summary The book follows Manson's life from when he was a child, born Brian Hugh Warner, until the events of the band's controversial Dead to the World Tour. It also details his grandfather's sexual fetishes (including bestiality and sadomasochism) to the forming of Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids, to the recording of Antichrist Superstar. Its last pages are the journal of the band's touring, documenting backstage events and people's reactions. The book includes many references to his life of drugs, sex and dysfunctional relationships which he attributes as causal to his current status quo. It also features his journalism works, including an article about a dominatrix he interviewed for 25th Parallel. The autobiography goes in-depth into the break-ups in the band's history. It follows several members through becoming friends and musicians with the band to angry and sometimes bitter leavings, some band members detested being fired so badly that lawsuits have been filed against Manson by his own crew members. Along with the book are numerous pictures, some of which are familiar to long- time Manson fans, with the center pages including everything from the Slasher Girls to Manson performing \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" with a Bible in his hand. The book incorporates illustrations from a public domain edition of Gray's Anatomy, originally drawn by Henry Vandyke Carter. For example, the ribcage in the cover image (which also appears in the liner note artwork for Antichrist Superstar) is taken from Gray's Figure 115. Also scattered throughout the pages are documents of such things as girlfriends, legal documents of claims made by the American Family Association about his shows that were proven to be false, and band landmarks, to the rarer, such as Manson with Anton LaVey. Background and writing right Neil Strauss, a rock critic and reporter for The New York Times, met Marilyn Manson through his work for Spin and Rolling Stone. Strauss initially perceived Manson as a \\"phony\\" who had gotten on the gothic rock bandwagon very late; he later came to see Manson as a \\"really interesting, really intelligent artist\\" with many talents. He went to talk to Manson at a Holiday Inn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Manson asked Strauss to join him in a hot tub, commenting \\"This is going to be an important piece of press.\\" Strauss wrote a cover story about Manson for Rolling Stone, which in the view of the Chicago Reader Jim DeRogatis \\"legitimized Manson's emergence as one of the most notorious entertainers of the 90s and an enthusiastic bogeyman for the right\\". Following the publication of the article, Strauss became Manson's business partner. Later, Manson and Strauss got a deal to write the singer's autobiography for ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins founded by Judith Regan, who was behind Howard Stern's Private Parts (1997). The autobiography shares its title with the Marilyn Manson song \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" (1997) and features an introduction written by film director David Lynch; Manson had previously contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Lynch's film Lost Highway (1997) and would later collaborate with the director on a coffee table book titled Genealogies of Pain (2011). Promotion On February 21, 1998, Manson held a two-hour in-store book signing at the San Francisco Virgin Megastore. The event was attended by an estimated 700 fans. Critical reception Contemporary reviews of The Long Hard Road Out of Hell were mixed. In The Austin Chronicle, Marc Savlov hailed the book as \\"a terrific rock & roll saga in the epic vein....Like Manson's gooney-harsh music and Danzig-on-goofdust lyrics, the book sucks you in and never lets you go until the final appendices are past.\\" Tucson Weekly James DiGiovanna found the book \\"quite good\\" and praised its opening chapters for insightfully \\"illustrating the mesmerizing and disquieting effect such images can have on the young. This alone gives the book interest far beyond its status as a celebrity's story.\\" Jason Morgan of The Washington Post said that the book's prose is \\"surprisingly polished and even beautiful on occasion,\\" it sometimes succumbs to \\"lush writerly excess\\" reminiscent of William Faulkner's work. SF Weekly said that \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell isn't a bad read at all\\" but it left \\"essential ground...uncovered.\\" He found the book's narrative reminiscent of both Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis (1915) and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925). In Entertainment Weekly, Rob Brunner never explained why Manson grew into the man that he did and featured numerous boring passages about debauchery. People said that the \\"tell-too-much autobio reveals that beneath the weird makeup, noisy music and parent-enraging act beats the heart of...a boring guy from Ohio.\\" Retrospective reviews were more positive. Greg Burk of LA Weekly said that the book stood as \\"the most self- abasing and funny piece of rock mythology ever written.\\" Emily Barker of NME deemed The Long Hard Road Out of Hell one of the \\"juciest\\" rock star memoirs of all time and praised it for being revealing. Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone called the book \\"engrossing\\" while Grantland Steven Hyden said that it is Manson's \\"most interesting work.\\" Hyden added \\"One of the great 'tawdry' rock books, The Long Hard Road reads like an Oliver Stone adaptation of Hammer of the Gods, taking all the tropes of rock expos√©s ‚Äî the excessive drug use, the gross-out groupie debauchery, the studio-bound infighting ‚Äî and pushing them to bizarre, sickening, and compulsively readable extremes.\\" Craig Hlavaty said that the book is one of the greatest \\"Rock Tell-All Autobiographies\\" of all time. In an article describing Manson as a reactionary comparable to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, J. R. Moores of Drowned in Sound said that \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell is Ayn Rand for people with pentagram thumb-rings.\\" Craig Hlavaty of the Houston Press questioned whether the book was entirely factual, as did SF Weekly.

It is unique in the plant kingdom as the only known flower to pollinate itself.Observed, Smithsonian, September 2006, p. 24 Pollination Rather than depending on insects or even the wind for pollination, scientists have discovered that Holcoglossum amesianum actually fertilizes itself. The orchid defies gravity to twist the male part of its flower into the necessary shape to fertilize the female one. The plant does so without the help of sticky fluids or other methods used by self-pollinating plants to ensure that the pollen reaches the egg. It grows on tree trunks in China's Yunnan province and flowers during the dry, windless months of February to April. The orchid produces no scent or nectar. Instead, the pollen-bearing anther uncovers itself and rotates into a suitable position to insert into the stigma cavity, where fertilization takes place. This sexual relationship is so exclusive that flowers do not even transfer pollen to other flowers on the same plant.

Since Trembling was the most beautiful, her older sisters made her stay at home, for fear that she would marry before them. After seven years, the son of the king of Emania fell in love with Fair. A henwife told Trembling she should go to church; when she objected that she had no suitable dress, the henwife gave her one, a horse, a honey-finger, and a honey-bird and told her to leave as soon as Mass was done. She obeyed, and got away before any man came near her. After two more times, the son of the king of Emania forgot Fair for the woman who had come to church and ran after her, managing to get her shoe when she rode off. The king's son looked for the woman whose foot the shoe fit, although the other king's sons warned him that he would have to fight them for her. They searched all over, and when they came to the house, they insisted on trying Trembling as well. The king's son said at once that she was the woman; Trembling went off and reappeared in the clothing she had worn to church, and everyone else agreed. The sons of foreign kings fought him for her, but the king's son defeated them all, and the Irish king's sons said they would not fight one of their own. So the king's son and Trembling got married. Trembling had a son, and her husband sent for Fair to help her. One day, when they walked by the seashore, Fair pushed Trembling in. A whale swallowed Trembling, and Fair passed herself off as her sister. The prince put his sword in bed between them, declaring that if she were his wife, it would grow warm, and if not, it would grow cold. In the morning, it was cold. A cowherd had seen Fair push Trembling in and saw the whale swallow her. The next day, he saw the whale spit her back up. She told him that the whale would swallow and spit her back up three times, and she could not leave the beach. Unless her husband rescued her by shooting the whale in a spot on its back, she would not be freed. Her sister gave the cowherd a drink that made him forget the first time, but the second, he told the prince. The prince shot the whale. They sent word to her father, who said that they could execute Fair if they wanted to. They told him he could do as he pleased, so the father abandoned her on the sea in a barrel, with provisions. Their next child was a daughter, and they decided to marry her to the cowherd. Motifs The heroine being disposed of also appears in \\"The Twa Sisters\\", \\"Bushy Bride\\", and \\"The Sea-Maiden\\"; in the latter two, the heroine must be rescued by the hero.

Located in Downtown Houston between the Main Street and Fannin Street viaducts, the landing encompasses the southern bank of Buffalo Bayou, the city's principal river, at its confluence with White Oak Bayou, a major tributary. Allen's Landing is located south of the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown Commerce Street Building. In August 1836, just months after the Republic of Texas won its independence from Mexico, two New York real estate developers, John Kirby Allen and Augustus Chapman Allen, purchased of coastal prairie and settled the town of Houston on the banks of Buffalo Bayou. The present-day landing area was advertised as the head of navigation of the bayou and served as the city's first wharf. History Allen's Landing is at the confluence of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou and serves as a natural turning basin. A dock was quickly opened on the site, and the steamer Laura was the first ship to anchor at the landing on January 26, 1837. The landing was officially named a port in 1841‚Äîthe original Port of Houston. In 1910, the United States government approved funding for the dredging of a ship channel from the Gulf of Mexico to the present turning basin four miles (6 km) to the east of Allen's Landing. Allen's Landing, c. 1900 In the late 1960s, Allen's Landing was home to the city's premiere psychedelic nightclub, Love Street Light Circus Feel Good Machine (\\"Love Street\\"), where bands with names like Bubble Puppy, Neurotic Sheep and American Blues performed mind-expanding music accented with strobe lights and pastel projections. The historic Sunset Coffee Building on Commerce at Main Street, which housed the nightclub on its third floor, is still standing. Love Street's last show was on July 7, 1980. Once the focal point of downtown Houston, a small historical park was dedicated at the site in 1967. The Southern Pacific Railroad donated of land to the park project, which was to be developed and maintained by the Houston Chamber of Commerce, the City of Houston, and the Harris County Navigation District. In addition, a marker was placed at the park to indicate where, in 1837, townspeople erected a liberty pole to commemorate Sam Houston's victory over Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto the previous year. For a brief period in the 1990s, Allen's Landing was once again the docking site for the Laura, a sightseeing boat that was a namesake of the 19th century vessel. The name Allen‚Äôs Landing is a 20th- century creation not found in any historical document. According to a 2008 Houston Chronicle article, the name was the invention of the Houston Chamber of Commerce. Charlie Lansden, longtime director of the chamber's Community Betterment Division, made this claim to Janet Wagner, a local historian. The name appears in a mural of Houston commissioned by the Houston Club in 1955 and painted by artist David Adickes. Revitalization Allen's Landing Park After years of neglect and deterioration, Allen‚Äôs Landing, as part of Houston's Waterfront District, has undergone major revitalization and rejuvenation, much like the rest of historic downtown Houston. The first phase of the Allen's Landing revitalization project was completed in 2001. Special features of the park, located at 1001 Commerce Street, now include: a concrete-paved wharf, designed to replicate the original port; a trail/walkway; a promenade; and a terrace overlooking Buffalo Bayou. The campus of the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown (UHD) straddles Allen's Landing. The university's One Main Building, which is housed in the former Merchants and Manufacturers Building (renovated in the 1980s), is just across the bayou at One Main Street, and UHD's Commerce Street Building, which was completed in May 2005, sits adjacent to the park at Main Street and Commerce. Since 2001, in a celebration of Houston's Asian American community, the Texas Dragon Boat Association has held an annual spring festival at Allen's Landing, where teams of paddlers race dragon boats throughout the day and enjoy colorful entertainment, as well as some Asian cultural and cuisine. In addition, the landing is a popular ingress/egress spot for canoe and kayak enthusiasts traveling up and down Buffalo Bayou. In 2006, Houston Endowment, Inc., a philanthropic foundation dedicated to improving life for the people of the greater Houston area, approved a $600,000 grant to be used by the Buffalo Bayou Partnership toward restoring and converting the 1930s Sunset Coffee Building into usable space and further improving Allen's Landing Park.

The school, is located in the residential neighborhood of Carrasco Norte, Montevideo, Uruguay. The school's head master is Patricia Ponce de Leon. The school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), currently offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP).The College also offers valuable international exams such us the IGCSE programs and the A levels. It has a very long list of distinguished former pupils, including economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.  Location  The school is located in the south-east neighborhood of Carrasco Norte in Montevideo's metropolitan area.  History  It was founded in 1955 by the Christian Brothers, the founders also of Cardinal Newman College, Buenos Aires. By then many Uruguayans upper class Catholics were unhappy with the educational system of public schools were concerned that their children receive religious education. Between 1953 and 1954 efforts were made to the Christian Brothers for the congregation to be installed in Uruguay, and founded a school for boys in the exclusive suburb of Carrasco. This created a committee composed of the Moor family, Davie, Surraco Germain, Manuel P√©rez del Castillo and Stella Ferreira, Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, Enrique Rozada, Antonio Barreiro, Conrad Hughes, Francisco Ferrer, Rodolfo Anaya, Antonio Galan, Eduardo Strauch and Jorge Alvarez Olloniego. They also collaborated Gallinal Alberto Heber, William Strauch, Roberto Houni, Jorge Eduardo Azn√°rez and Berenbau. After arduous negotiations, in early 1955, from Nairobi, Brothers Nairobi J. I. Doorley and J. V. Ryan arrived, with a mission to make final arrangements for the opening of the new school. They rented a house located at 6585 Republic of Mexico Promenade Corner Puyol. Brother Doorley returned to Buenos Aires and was replaced by Brother P. C. Kelly. Shortly after, Brothers J. V. O'Reilly and H. G. McCaig arrived. Classes began on May 2, 1955. That year a polio epidemic forced authorities to postpone the start of courses. Brother Patrick Kelly, a devotee of the Virgin Mary and, since the school was facing the sea, decided to call it \\"Stella Maris\\", as the parish in the area. The playground for physical activities and sports Carrasco was the beach in front of the house. Later, the Carrasco Polo Club allowed the use of their courts. The school grew rapidly. Of 93 students in 1955 went to 137 in 1956 and 279 in 1958. In 1957 he joined another house on the same block, in Potosi 1536, in the depths of the house of Puyol and the Rambla. In 1959 he began teaching school, with a first year and four teachers. On March 12, 1961 opened the school's current location on the street Tajes Max, with the blessing of Cardinal Antonio Mar√≠a Barbieri. In late 1962 he graduated the first generation of students in fourth grade. In 1963 he implemented the system of \\"Houses\\" (Casas), which identifies all the students into four groups: Prior, Sion, Iona and Newman, each with a color identificatorio. In 1972 the building was expanded, adding a new section for high school. In 1976 this area was completed with the construction of a second plant to high school, which includes a library and laboratories for physics, chemistry and biology. In 1985 he joined the first generation of women to high school and, since 1989, joined the first generation of girls to primary school preparatory. Since that year the school became gradually to be mixed at all levels and have three groups by grade rather than the existing two. In 1991 the school added preschool from age four. The Christian Brothers are not currently residing in Uruguay. In 1998 he left the school, although the institution remains the property of Edmund Rice Education Association, whose local address part three brothers of the congregation.  The Andes Accident of 1972  The school gained accidental fame when its alumni rugby team flew on Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which crashed into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972. The story of the crash and rescue was first told in the 1974 book Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors and more recently in the 2006 book Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home. The school also appeared in the documentary, Alive: 20 Years Later. Twelve of the 45 people on board the plane died in the crash, and more died of their injuries later. Another 8 perished in an avalanche. The remaining survivors endured hunger, crash-related injuries, altitude sickness, and temperatures that fell to 30 degrees below zero at night. On their eighth day in the mountains, they heard on the radio that the authorities had stopped searching for them. When their scarce food reserves were gone, they were forced to eat those who had died in the crash. On December 12, 3 of the remaining survivors set out to find help, hiking west across the Andes Mountains to reach Chile. After scaling the nearly 17,000-foot Mt. Seler, they realized that the trek for help would take them much longer than they had thought. Therefore, to conserve their limited food supply, one of them returned to the crash site and the other two continued hiking west. On 21 December 1972, the ninth day of their journey, they were found by huasos who grazed livestock in the high country, and the next day, the world learned of the 16 survivors who had beaten death for 72 days in the Andes mountains, in part by resorting to cannibalism.Alive : The Andes Accident 1972  Official Site  Notable alumni  * Roberto Canessa * Nando Parrado * Carlos P√°ez Rodr√≠guez * Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez (racing driver) References  External links  * Stella Maris College (Montevideo) Category:1972 Andes flight disaster Category:Education in Montevideo Category:Congregation of Christian Brothers secondary schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in Uruguay Category:Carrasco, Montevideo ","title":"Stella Maris College (Montevideo)"},{"id":"5674861","text":"Aotea College is a state co-educational secondary school located in Porirua, New Zealand. Founded in 1978, the school serves students for Year 9 to 13 (ages 12 to 18) across the northern suburbs of Porirua. Demographics At the September 2013 Education Review Office (ERO) review, Aotea College had 936 students enrolled, including seven international students. Forty-seven percent of students were male and 53 percent were female. Thirty-seven percent of students identified as New Zealand European (PƒÅkehƒÅ), 28 percent identified as MƒÅori, 26 percent as Pacific Islanders, seven percent as Asian, and two percent as another ethnicity. Aotea College has a socio-economic decile of 5 (step M), meaning it draws its school community from areas of moderate socioeconomic status when compared to other New Zealand schools.  Redevelopment  In late 2015, it was announced that Aotea College would receive $24 million from the New Zealand Ministry of Education to fund an upgrade of the school's ageing facilities. Work was scheduled to begin in early 2017, which would see the construction of new flexible learning spaces with high standards of heating and lighting. Such an upgrade was warranted after recent storms and decades of deterioration had led to an estimated half of the college's buildings becoming leaky. Furthermore, the Te Manawa building was closed in 2015 due to the presence of black mould.  Sport and cultural activities  Sport and cultural activities are a major part of Aotea College. Students are encouraged to take at least one winter sport and summer sport. Aotea College competes in the New Zealand National Secondary Schools Barbershop competition - in 2008,2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 the girls' chorus won first place in both the regional and the national competition in Wellington.

Biographies and works Costume design for Day and Night by Georgii Stenberg ‚Äì circa 1920 The Stenberg brothers, whose father was a Swede and whose mother was a Latvian, were both born in Moscow, Russia but remained Swedish citizens until 1933. They first studied engineering, then attended the Stroganov School of Applied Art in Moscow, 1912‚Äì1917, and subsequently the Moscow Svomas (free studios), where they and other students designed decorations and posters for the first May Day celebration (1918). 1919, the Stenbergs and comrades founded the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) and participated in its first group exhibition in Moscow in May 1919 and in the exhibitions of 1920, 1921 and 1923. The brothers and Konstantin Medunetskii staged their own \\"Constructivists\\" exhibition in January 1922 at the Poets Caf√© Moscow, accompanied by a Constructivist manifesto. Also that year, Vladimir showed his work in the landmark Erste Russische Kunstausstellung (First Russian Art Exhibition) held in Berlin. 1920s‚Äì1930s, they were well established as members of the avant-garde in Moscow and of Moscow's INKhUK (INstitut KHUdozhestvennoy Kultury, or institute of artistic culture). Other INKhUK members included Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Lyubov Popova, Medunetskii, other artists, architects, theoreticians, and art historians. INKhUK was active only 1921‚Äì1924. 1922‚Äì1931, the Stenbergs designed sets and costumes for Alexander Tairov's Moscow Kamerny (Chamber) theatre and contributed to LEF (art journal of the left front) and to the 1925 \\"Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes\\" in Paris. 1929‚Äì32, they taught at the Architecture- Construction Institute, Moscow. The Stenbergs practiced in a range of media, initially active as Constructivist sculptors, subsequently as theater designers, architects, and draftspeople. Their design work covered the gamut from clothing, including women's shoes, to rail carriages. Some examples of their sculpture were spidery and spindly structures, such as the reconstruction (1973‚Äì1974) of KPS 11: Construction of a spatial apparatus no. 11 (1919‚Äì1920) in steel, glass, paint and plaster on wood in the National Gallery of Australia Canberra. However, the arenas in which they excelled were theater, costume and graphic designs, particularly the graphic design of film posters, encouraged by the surging interest in movies in Russia and the government's sanctioning of graphic design and the cinema. The brothers were at their prime during the revolutionary period of politics and artistic experimentation in Russia, centered in Moscow. There was a shift from the illustrator-as-creator to the constructor-as-creator or nonlinear-narrator-as- creator. In the visual language of the constructor or Constructivist, the Stenbergs and other graphic designers and artists assembled images, such as portions of photographs and preprinted paper, that had been created by others. Thus, the Stenbergs and others realized wholly new images (or compositions) which were no longer about realism. Hence, graphic design as a modern expression eschewing traditional fine art was born in the form of the printed reproductions of collage or assemblage. One of the causes of the avant-garde artists in the new Russia, who considered fine art to be useless, was served when the Stenbergs and others as constructors-as-creators produced posters that had a use, particularly to serve the state. (In fact, painter Nadezhda Udaltsova resigned from the UNKhUK in protest against the replacement of easel painting by use-intended industrial art.) The serendipitous success of the Stenbergs' radical approach had been facilitated by a number of factors: their talent as graphic designers and their knowledge of film theory, Constructivism, Malevich's Suprematism, and the avant-garde theater. Even though commercial graphic design and advertising is propaganda, the dissemination of propaganda (–ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥—ã) was considered a desirable and honorable practice in Russia at the time. In fact, the Bolsheviks, who sought to reform the peasant class, considered film to be a potent propaganda tool for communicating with a widely illiterate population. Even though most films were imported, the Stenbergs designed posters for Sergei Eisenstein's movies and Dziga Vertov's documentaries. The innovative visual aspects of Stenberg posters included a distortion of perspective, elements from Dada photomontage, an exaggerated scale, a sense of movement, and a dynamic use of color and typography‚Äîeventually all were to be imitated by others. The Stenberg artwork was frequently based on stills from the films. Radical even today, the posters by the brothers working together were realized within the nine-year period from 1924 to 1933, the year Georgii died at age 33. His motorcycle hit a truck, a few months after the brothers had become Russian citizens. Vladimir continued to work on film posters and organized the decorations of Moscow's Red Square for the May Day celebration of 1947. Exhibition Current exhibition 'KINO/FILM.

He founded the American Negro Theater, the British Negro Theatre, and was the first African-American president of the Actors' Equity Association. He was also known for his work behind the scenes as a revolutionary trade unionist. Early life and acting career Born Frederick Douglas O'Neal in Brooksville, Mississippi, he was named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass. His father was a teacher and merchant. He had seven brothers and sisters. In 1919, when his father died, the family moved to St. Louis where he started acting professionally in 1927. O'Neal moved to New York in 1936 and worked as a laboratory assistant while studying acting at night. He made his New York debut with the Civic Repertory Theatre. Unsatisfied with the state of black theater, he helped establish the American Negro Theater in 1940 and appeared in a number of its productions. In 1944, he made his Broadway debut as the greedy brother-in-law in Anna Lucasta. For his performance, O'Neal won the Clarence Derwent Award as most promising newcomer of the theater season, the New York Drama Critics' Award for best supporting performance of 1944 and the Donaldson Award for the 1944-45 season. He recreated the role in Chicago and London, and in the film adaptation. He also earned acclaim for his stage portrayal of Lem Scott in Take a Giant Step in 1953, and reprised the role on film. In films, O'Neal appeared in Pinky, No Way Out and Something of Value. In 1953, O'Neal filmed a pilot for Sammy Davis Jr.'s ABC television show. The show presented African-Americans as struggling musicians, not the usual slapstick comedy or the stereotypical mammy roles of the time. The cast included actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Frances Davis who was the first black ballerina to perform for the Paris Opera The network couldn't get a sponsor, so the show was dropped. In 1955, O'Neal played the role of a detective in the mystery drama Danger. That year he portrayed a witch doctor in the Broadway musical House of Flowers. On television, O'Neal was frequently on Kraft Suspense and Hallmark Hall of Fame productions. He also portrayed Officer Wallace on Car 54, Where Are You? from 1961 to 1963. In 1964 he played Matty Howard in a boxing-centered episode of the ABC drama Breaking Point titled \\"Never Trouble Trouble Till Trouble Troubles You\\" that boasted a primarily black cast, including Terry Carter, Diana Sands, Rex Ingram, and Mark Dymally. He narrated, along with Hilda Simms, the educational record \\"Great Negro Americans\\" which was written and produced by Alan Sands (no relation to Diana). Organization and union work In 1927, O'Neal organized the Aldridge Players in St. Louis, a black theater group named for Ira Aldridge. He helped organize Harlem's American Negro Theatre in 1940, which started the careers of Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier, Earle Hyman, and Alice Childress among others. In 1948, he co- founded the British Negro Theatre. In 1958, O'Neal was named to Actors' Equity Association's council. He had lost the bid to become president, but six years later in 1964 he became president of the Actors' Equity Association. He was the first African-American president of Equity (1964‚Äì73). His work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. After leaving office, he was named the organization's president emeritus. O'Neal was elected president of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America in 1970 and retired from the position in 1988. O'Neal was vice president of the AFL-CIO and a member of its executive council.  Honors  O'Neal was inducted into the Black Film Makers Hall of Fame in 1975. The organization paid a special tribute to him in 1990. The NAACP named him 1979 Man of the Year. He was also honored by the National Urban League and the Black Heritage Association. O'Neal received several honorary degrees, including an Honorary Doctor of Human Letters from St. John's University in 1981.  Death  O'Neal died at the age of 86 in his home in Manhattan after a lengthy illness on August 25, 1992. He was survived by his wife Charlotte Talbot Hainey. References *Staff report (June 28, 1973).

In Philadelphia, she attended the Cheltenham High School, which inducted her posthumously into their Hall of Fame in 1999. From an early age, Colwin was a prolific writer. Her work first appeared in The New Yorker and, in 1974, her first collection of short stories was published. She was a regular contributor to Gourmet magazine and had articles in Mademoiselle, Allure, and Playboy. Her non-fiction books (Home Cooking and More Home Cooking) are collections of essays, and are as much memoirs as cookbooks. In the foreword to Home Cooking, Colwin wrote: \\"Even at her most solitary, a cook in the kitchen is surrounded by generations of cooks past, the advice and menus of cooks present, the wisdom of cookbook writers. In my kitchen I rely on Edna Lewis, Marcella Hazan, Jane Grigson, Elizabeth David, the numerous contributors to The Charleston Receipts, and Margaret Costa (author of an English book entitled The Four Seasons Cookery Book),\\"Colwin, Laurie. 2010.

He was a member of the Wargaming Hall of Fame. Hill is most well known as the designer of the extremely popular Avalon Hill board game Squad Leader in 1977. Early life Hill, as a child John Evans Hill was born on February 21, 1945, in Chicago and grew up in Elmhurst, Illinois. His mother was Marian Jean Whitley. His biological father was John T. Hill, who was killed in action during World War II before John Evans Hill was born. When Hill was three years old, Marian remarried Edward F. Whitley who was the man Hill knew to be his father. He also had a half-brother, Richard Whitley, a notable film and television writer. Hill grew up Catholic, attending and graduating from Immaculate Conception High School. After high school, Hill graduated from Purdue University with a four-year degree in Military History. Early career John Hill founded the Conflict Games Company in the late 1960s and owned a hobby shop, the Scale Model Shop, in Lafayette, Indiana, for several years. It has been reported the Scale Model Shop was lost in a flood. Conflict Games was sold in its entirety to Game Designers' Workshop. He later worked as an advertising executive for Boynton & Associates, which published trade magazines for the hobby industry. Wargame designs John Hill's first published wargames were released in 1972 and included Kasserine Pass (Conflict Games), Verdun, The Game of Attrition (Conflict Games) and The Brotherhood (Conflict Games). The next year he published Hue (Conflict Games), based upon the fighting near the City of Hue in the Vietnam War and Overlord (Conflict Games) based on the Normandy campaign. In 1974 and 1975 he published two games on the Arab-Israeli conflicts (Bar-Lev & Jerusalem) and in 1977 a game on the fighting in Korea. It was that same year that he sold Squad Leader to Avalon Hill. He also worked on the first module for Squad Leader, Cross of Iron (Avalon Hill, 1979). His standing in the commercial board wargaming industry was sufficiently high that when Simulations Publications, Inc. published his Battle for Stalingrad in 1980, his name appeared on the box top copy. Few games at the time were marketed on the strength of name recognition of the designer. Once again, when Eastern Front Tank Leader was published by West End Games in 1986 his name featured prominently on the cover. Hill cited Richard Berg as one of his influences. Hill developed a well known miniatures rules set for regimental level American Civil War miniature gaming, the Johnny Reb series (published by Game Designers' Workshop). He was noted for his elaborate 10mm miniature wargaming layouts for Civil War battles at Historical Miniatures Gaming Society conventions such as Historicon, Cold Wars and Fall In!. He founded and owned the Johnny Reb Gaming Company, which published the third version of the Johnny Reb rules. He developed Across A Deadly Field: The War in the East and Across A Deadly Field: The War in the West both focusing on the American Civil War tabletop gaming. Hill was a frequent contributor to the Johnny Reb Gaming Society's popular CHARGE! magazine, offering rules interpretations and strategy advice for Johnny Reb players. Awards and legacy In 1977, Hill received a Charles S. Roberts Award for designing Squad Leader. In 1978, Hill was named to the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame at the Origins gaming convention in Chester, Pennsylvania, on June 23, 1979. J P. Hunerwadel commented in 2001 that \\"John Hill's Squad Leader ... helped fuel the great board-war-game boom of the late seventies.\\"Hunerwadel, J P. (Spring 2001). \\"The Operational Art of War: Century of Warfare\\", Aerospace Power Journal 15 (1): 118‚Äì121. Game designer Dana Lombardy commented on Johnny Reb in 2007: \\"John Hill's Civil War miniatures rules remain innovative, challenging, and lots of fun, a claim supported by the game's loyal fan support. Clubs still stage Johnny Reb sessions at conventions around the world, more than 20 years after the rules were introduced.\\" Personal life He is survived by his wife, Luella Burton, of 46 years, daughter, Stephanie Hill and two grandchildren, Danielle and Carl Anthony Nardei. Later life John Hill lived in New Mexico in retirement after spending many years in Northern Virginia. He also served as a military analyst for the U.S. Government. Hill died on January 12, 2015, at Christus St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

It belongs to the SMAD family of transcription factor proteins, which act as mediators of TGF-Œ≤ signal transduction. The TGFŒ≤ family of cytokines regulates critical processes during the lifecycle of metazoans, with important roles during embryo development, tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and immune regulation. SMAD 4 belongs to the co-SMAD group, the second class of the SMAD family. SMAD4 is the only known co-SMAD in most metazoans. It also belongs to the Darwin family of proteins that modulate members of the TGFŒ≤ protein superfamily, a family of proteins that all play a role in the regulation of cellular responses. Mammalian SMAD4 is a homolog of the Drosophila protein \\"Mothers against decapentaplegic\\" named Medea. SMAD4 interacts with R-Smads, such as SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 (also called SMAD9) to form heterotrimeric complexes. Once in the nucleus, the complex of SMAD4 and two R-SMADS binds to DNA and regulates the expression of different genes depending on the cellular context. Intracellular reactions involving SMAD4 are triggered by the binding, on the surface of the cells, of growth factors from the TGFŒ≤ family. The sequence of intracellular reactions involving SMADS is called the SMAD pathway or the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) pathway since the sequence starts with the recognition of TGF-Œ≤ by cells.  Gene  In mammals, SMAD4 is coded by a gene located on chromosome 18. In humans, the SMAD4 gene contains 54 829 base pairs and is located from pair n¬∞ 51,030,212 to pair 51,085,041 in the region 21.1 of the chromosome 18. Pattern of the chromosome 18 in Homo sapiens. The SMAD 4 gene is located on the long arm of the chromosome, at locus 21.1. This locus corresponds to the black stripe between the regions 12.3 and 21.2.  Protein  SMAD4 is a 552 amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 60.439 Da. SMAD4 has two functional domains known as MH1 and MH2. SMAD 4 is composed of three major domains, including MH1 (up), MH2 (down) and a linking domain (right).The complex of two SMAD3 (or of two SMAD2) and one SMAD4 binds directly to DNA though interactions of their MH1 domains. These complexes are recruited to sites throughout the genome by cell lineage-defining transcription factors (LDTFs) that determine the context-dependent nature of TGF-Œ≤ action. Early insights into the DNA binding specificity of Smad proteins came from oligonucleotide binding screens, which identified the palindromic duplex 5'‚ÄìGTCTAGAC‚Äì3' as a high affinity binding sequence for SMAD3 and SMAD4 MH1 domains. Other motifs have also been identified in promoters and enhancers. These additional sites contain the CAGCC motif and the GGC(GC)(CG) consensus sequences, the latter also known as 5GC sites. The 5GC-motifs are highly represented as clusters of sites, in SMAD-bound regions genome-wide. These clusters can also contain CAG(AC)(CC) sites. SMAD3/SMAD4 complex also binds to the TPA-responsive gene promoter elements, which have the sequence motif TGAGTCAG.  Structures  =MH1 domain complexes with DNA motifs= The first structure of SMAD4 bound to DNA was the complex with the palindromic GTCTAGAC motif. Recently, the structures of SMAD4 MH1 domain bound to several 5GC motifs have also been determined. In all complexes, the interaction with the DNA involves a conserved Œ≤-hairpin present in the MH1 domain. The hairpin is partially flexible in solution and its high degree of conformational flexibility allows recognition of the different 5-bp sequences. Efficient interactions with GC-sites occur only if a G nucleotide is located deep in the major grove, and establishes hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium group of Arg81. This interaction facilitates a complementary surface contact between the Smad DNA-binding hairpin and the major groove of the DNA. Other direct interactions involve Lys88 and Gln83. The X-ray crystal structure of the Trichoplax adhaerens SMAD4 MH1 domains bound to the GGCGC motif indicates a high conservation of this interaction in metazoans. Smad4 MH1 domain bound to the GGCT DNA motif, from Close-up view of the Smad4 MH1 domain bound to the GGCGC DNA motif, from Smad4 MH1 domain bound to the GGCGC DNA motif, from =MH2 domain complexes= The MH2 domain, corresponding to the C-terminus, is responsible for receptor recognition and association with other SMADs. It interacts with the R-SMADS MH2 domain and forms heterodimers and heterotrimers. Some tumor mutations detected in SMAD4 enhance interactions between the MH1 and MH2 domains.  Nomenclature and origin of name  SMADs are highly conserved across species, especially in the N terminal MH1 domain and the C terminal MH2 domain. The SMAD proteins are homologs of both the Drosophila protein MAD and the C. elegans protein SMA. The name is a combination of the two. During Drosophila research, it was found that a mutation in the gene MAD in the mother repressed the gene decapentaplegic in the embryo. The phrase \\"Mothers against\\" was added, since mothers often form organizations opposing various issues, e.g. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), reflecting \\"the maternal-effect enhancement of dpp\\"; and based on a tradition of unusual naming within the research community. SMAD4 is also known as DPC4, JIP or MADH4. Function and action mechanism SMAD4 is a protein defined as an essential effector in the SMAD pathway. SMAD4 serves as a mediator between extracellular growth factors from the TGFŒ≤ family and genes inside the cell nucleus. The abbreviation co in co-SMAD stands for common mediator. SMAD4 is also defined as a signal transducer. In the TGF-Œ≤ pathway, TGF-Œ≤ dimers are recognized by a transmembrane receptor, known as type II receptor. Once the type II receptor is activated by the binding of TGF-Œ≤, it phosphorylates a type I receptor. Type I receptor is also a cell surface receptor. This receptor then phosphorylates intracellular receptor regulated SMADS (R-SMADS) such as SMAD2 or SMAD3. The phosphorylated R-SMADS then bind to SMAD4. The R-SMADs-SMAD4 association is a heteromeric complex. This complex is going to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus: it is the translocation. SMAD4 may form heterotrimeric, heterohexameric or heterodimeric complexes with R-SMADS. SMAD4 is a substrate of the Erk/MAPK kinase and GSK3. The FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) pathway stimulation leads to Smad4 phosphorylation by Erk of the canonical MAPK site located at Threonine 277. This phosphorylation event has a dual effect on Smad4 activity. First, it allows Smad4 to reach its peak of transcriptional activity by activating a growth factor-regulated transcription activation domain located in the Smad4 linker region, SAD (Smad-Activation Domain). Second, MAPK primes Smad4 for GSK3-mediated phosphorylations that cause transcriptional inhibition and also generate a phosphodegron used as a docking site by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Beta-transducin Repeat Containing (beta-TrCP) that polyubiquitinates Smad4 and targets it for degradation in the proteasome. Smad4 GSK3 phosphorylations have been proposed to regulate the protein stability during pancreatic and colon cancer progression. In the nucleus the heteromeric complex binds promoters and interact with transcriptional activators. SMAD3/SMAD4 complexes can directly bind the SBE. These associations are weak and require additional transcription factors such as members of the AP-1 family, TFE3 and FoxG1 to regulate gene expression. Many TGFŒ≤ ligands use this pathway and subsequently SMAD4 is involved in many cell functions such as differentiation, apoptosis, gastrulation, embryonic development and the cell cycle.  Clinical significance  Genetic experiments such as gene knockout (KO), which consist in modifying or inactivating a gene, can be carried out in order to see the effects of a dysfunctional SMAD 4 on the study organism. Experiments are often conducted in the house mouse (Mus musculus). It has been shown that, in mouse KO of SMAD4, the granulosa cells, which secrete hormones and growth factors during the oocyte development, undergo premature luteinization and express lower levels of follicle-stimulating hormone receptors (FSHR) and higher levels of luteinizing hormone receptors (LHR). This may be due in part to impairment of bone morphogenetic protein-7 effects as BMP-7 uses the SMAD4 signaling pathway. Deletions in the genes coding for SMAD1 and SMAD5 have also been linked to metastasic granulosa cell tumors in mice. SMAD4, is often found mutated in many cancers. The mutation can be inherited or acquired during an individual's lifetime. If inherited, the mutation affects both somatic cells and cells of the reproductive organs. If the SMAD 4 mutation is acquired, it will only exist in certain somatic cells. Indeed, SMAD 4 is not synthesized by all cells. The protein is present in skin, pancreatic, colon, uterus and epithelial cells. It is also produced by fibroblasts. The functional SMAD 4 participates in the regulation of the TGF-Œ≤ signal transduction pathway, which negatively regulates growth of epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). When the structure of SMAD 4 is altered, expression of the genes involved in cell growth is no longer regulated and cell proliferation can go on without any inhibition. The important number of cell divisions leads to the forming of tumors and then to multiploid colorectal cancer and pancreatic carcinoma. It is found inactivated in at least 50% of pancreatic cancers. Somatic mutations found in human cancers of the MH1 domain of SMAD 4 have been shown to inhibit the DNA-binding function of this domain. SMAD 4 is also found mutated in the autosomal dominant disease juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS). JPS is characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These polyps are usually benign, however they are at greater risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, in particular colon cancer. Around 60 mutations causing JPS have been identified. They have been linked to the production of a smaller SMAD 4, with missing domains that prevent the protein from binding to R-SMADS and forming heteromeric complexes. Mutations in SMAD4 (mostly substitutions) can cause Myhre syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by mental disabilities, short stature, unusual facial features, and various bone abnormalities.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 flowing into Buzzards Bay in southeastern Massachusetts, in the United States. The name \\"Acushnet\\" comes from the Wampanoag or Algonquian word, \\"Cushnea\\", meaning \\"as far as the waters\\", a word that was used by the original owners of the land in describing the extent of the parcel they intended to sell to the English settlers from the nearby Plimouth colony. Quite naturally, the English mistook \\"Cushnea\\" for a fixed placename or the name of a specific river. Path of the river The source of the Acushnet River is Long Pond in Lakeville, Massachusetts. The root tributary, Squam Brook, flows out of Long Pond and through the settlement called Freetown before it fills the New Bedford Reservoir in the town of Acushnet. From the reservoir, the river continues southward, forming the dividing-line between Acushnet and the city of New Bedford. Then it divides New Bedford, on its western bank, from Fairhaven, on its eastern bank, before spilling into Buzzards Bay, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. The six bridges The river is crossed by bridges six times. There are three short bridges in Acushnet, where the river is narrow. As the river leaves Acushnet, it widens to form an estuarine harbor, New Bedford harbor, which is flanked by New Bedford and Fairhaven. Shortly after the river leaves Acushnet, a larger bridge, the Coggeshall Street Bridge, crosses between Fairhaven and New Bedford. The fifth bridge is one that carries a large limited-access highway, Interstate 195, across the river, about 150 metres south of the Coggeshall Street span. The sixth and last bridge is actually a complex of three small bridges that hopscotch from islet to islet across the breadth of New Bedford harbor, carrying US Route 6. Beginning on the western (New Bedford) side of the river, there is a short bridge over the shallow gut dividing the New Bedford bank from Fish Island. The second part of the traverse involves crossing the main river channel between Fish Island and Pope's Island via the New Bedford-Fairhaven Bridge, a swing bridge that originally opened in 1902. Finally, the road crosses the shallow eastern passage from Pope's Island to Fairhaven along the low-lying Pope's Island Bridge. The hurricane barrier Beginning in 1958, the New Bedford Harbor Hurricane Barrier was built from a point about 300 feet north of Fort Phoenix, in Fairhaven, to Gifford Street on the New Bedford coast. The 20-foot high barrier continues onto land, where three large doors allow street traffic to pass through during calm seas. The longer segment continues along the New Bedford coast to just before Frederick Street. A discontiguous segment protects the top of Clark's Cove in New Bedford, roughly to the Dartmouth border. The barrier consists of an arc of riprap and fill, approximately three kilometres long, surmounted by a service road. At the center of the marine structure is a control tower and a set of hydraulically operated doors that can be closed, when necessary, to shut out the surge of seawater that typically accompanies a major storm or hurricane. Taken as a whole, the barrier is the largest stone structure on the East Coast of the United States. A structure with the same purpose, the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, was constructed across the throat of Narragansett Bay, near Providence, Rhode Island, about forty kilometres from this structure spanning the mouth of the Acushnet. Historical significance Historically, the river's banks were home to many mills, especially on the New Bedford side of the river. The river's mouth, which forms a small but well-sheltered harbor, has long served as the home port of New Bedford's commercial fishing fleet. It is also the birthplace of New Bedford's whaling industry; the Dartmouth, the first ship whose keel was laid in New Bedford, first set sail on this river. (The ship would go on to fame as one of those involved in the Boston Tea Party.) On the eastern (Fairhaven) shore, the mouth of the river is guarded by Fort Phoenix, a fortification that was involved, in 1775, in the first naval engagement of the American Revolutionary War.

These channels were to have been provided by Clear Channel Communications and were to have been located in \\"Regional News, Talk & Music Channels.\\" According to Jon Zellner via a subscriber email, Clear Channel decided to forego the launch of these channels.http://www.xmfan.com/viewtopic.php?t=66362 The original plan was to create a set of regionalized, five-minute newscasts. Each newscast was to carry 90 seconds of advertising, with the 3:30-minute balance devoted to regionally targeted news. The channels were to be titled: **Northeast News and Talk **Southeast News and Talk **Midwest News and Talk **Middle America News and Talk **Southwest News and Talk **Northwest News and Talk =Channels of unknown status= * XM Announced on 1/31/06 that they would be adding Traffic & Weather channels for Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver-Boulder, Milwaukee- Racine, Portland, Providence-Warwick-Pawtucket, Sacramento, San Antonio and Wilmington, DE to their NavTraffic product during the first quarter 2006.NavTraffic requires a subscription separate from the regular XM service. Information can be found here or here. Rumors that a Traffic & Weather station could be dropped for Cincinnati due to the addition of WLW on XM channel 173 were unfounded as WLW was dropped from the XM service in 2009. =Seasonal/holiday channels= These channels are season- and holiday-based, and are only around for a part of the year. It is not uncommon that they take the place of an existing channel. As of 2014, Sirius XM has reduced the periods that some of the holiday channels run for the 2015 season with only Holly and Holiday Traditions running for the full season (day after Halloween to day after Christmas.) * Holly - Holly is one of Sirius XM's annual month- long Christmas music channels that plays Christmas songs with an emphasis on up and coming singers. Its playlist changes from what one would find on an FM Adult Contemporary station at Christmas time to what one would find on a station aimed at tweens and teens. It previously aired on SiriusXM Love (2009-2014, 2016-present) and Velvet (2015). * Holiday Traditions - Holiday Traditions is not a traditional Christmas channel per se, but instead is narrowly focused on seasonal pop recordings from the 1940s to the 1960s. * Holiday Pops - This holiday channel plays choral and orchestral music with a Christmas theme. It replaces Sirius XM Pops in December and is therefore presented in XM HD Surround. Formerly known as \\"Pops Holiday Classics\\" (2005) and \\"A Classical Christmas\\" (2006‚Äì07). In summer 2014 the Sirius XM Pops station was discontinued and Holiday Pops will air during a reduced period, only during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (December 24/25 - before the Sirius XM pops station was cancelled it operated during the bulk of December.) * Country Christmas - This channel features Christmas-themed country music. It previously aired on XM as \\"A Nashville Christmas\\" (2005) and \\"Music City Holiday\\" (2006‚Äì07). * Radio Hanukkah - This channel was debuted in 2006 for the Hanukkah celebration. Radio Hanukkah features the best in Jewish music, comedy, Broadway, talk and kids programming. This was the first satellite radio channel dedicated exclusively to Jewish culture. Following the merger with Sirius, Radio Hanukkah produced almost exclusively Jewish music selections, foregoing the comedy, Broadway, talk, and kids programming. The following seasonal channels also aired on XM in past years. * Special XMas - From 2001-07, this seasonal incarnation of the defunct Special X channel featured novelty holiday music, from songs by the likes of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Barney, to parody songs from Bob Rivers and Weird Al Yankovic, to the more grown-up xL tastes from punk rock bands. Special XMas also aired online and on DirecTV. * Bing Crosby Christmas Radio - Airing in 2008 and 2009 and hosted by members of the Crosby family, this channel featured more than twenty years of vintage Crosby radio specials. =XM on AOL Radio= On 2008-04-30, the XM channels were no longer offered on AOL Radio, as AOL switched to CBS Radio for some of its content, thus ending a partnership between AOL and XM.

History Bill's opened during the 50th Anniversary of Harrah's in 1987 and was named in honor of William F. Harrah. There was no hotel, although there was an on-site tattoo parlor. Bill's also hosted UFC pay per view fights at all of its bars. In January 2007, Bill's became the only non-smoking casino in Tahoe. After years of business decline, Bill's Casino closed its doors for good January 4, 2010. The site and surrounding parcels of land were purchased by attorney Melvin Laub in March 2010 for US $5.22 million with the intention of turning the location into a large strip club. It was later reported that the site would be transformed into a mall including a pharmacy, a jewellery store, a tattoo studio, a Pilates studio, a clothing store, another casino and a restaurant and bar. The Tahoe Daily Tribune reported on a safe was discovered behind a false wall during renovations during August 2011. On August 23, a posting on reddit by the son of the purchaser of Bill's casino prematurely stated the opening of the safe will be documented on reddit. The Oprah Winfrey Network gained exclusive access to the opening of the safe for the TV show Found, that is in development and the broadcast date is not known. The safe was opened 14 Sep 2011 in the presence of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office investigator, but did not find anything relevant to an investigation.

The weapon is in use with the armed forces of several Asian, African and Latin American countries. It was also license-manufactured by F√°brica de Bra√ßo de Prata in Portugal as the m/968 and in Mexico by SEDENA as the MG21. In the German military (Bundeswehr) and the federal police (Bundespolizei) it is designated \\"G8\\". Design details =Operating mechanism= A schematic of the Heckler & Koch roller-delayed blowback mechanism The HK21 is a selective fire roller-delayed blowback-operated firearm with a semi-rigid locking mechanism designed to retard the rearward movement of the bolt. This delay was achieved by artificially increasing the inertia of the bolt by using an angular, interposed transmission system, installed symmetrically to the bore axis, with two cylindrical rollers acting as transmission elements against a movable locking piece which drives the heavy bolt carrier. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, which contains the aforementioned rollers, and a supporting locking piece and bolt carrier. During the \\"unlocking\\" sequence, the bolt head receives the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge and exerts rearward pressure against the rollers, seated in recesses in the barrel extension. The rollers are driven inward against angled ramps of the barrel extension and interact with the wedge-shaped locking piece, projecting it backwards. Thus a chambering dependent (4:1 for 7.62√ó51mm NATO) or (3:1 for 5.56√ó45mm NATO) transmission ratio is maintained (as long as the rollers move on the inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and locking piece) of the bolt carrier and locking piece relative to the bolt head; the bolt head carrier travels backwards significantly faster than the bolt head, ensuring a safe drop of pressure within the barrel prior to extraction. Since extraction is carried-out under relatively high pressure, the barrel's chamber received a series of flutes designed to help free the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber wall. Like the G3 and HK33 assault rifle bolts the HK21 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \\"bolt head locking lever\\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt). =Features= HK21 with ammunition belts and bipod positioned at the rear near its point of balance HK21 and bipod positioned at the front for maximum stability The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the feed mechanism or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.Kokalis, Peter: Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune, page 18. Paladin Press, 2001. The bolt features a spring-powered extractor and an anti-bounce device that prevents the bolt head from glancing off the barrel extension upon forward return of the locking assembly. The lever-type ejector system is contained in the trigger group housing and is actuated with every shot by the recoiling bolt. The weapon has a hammer striker and is fired from the for a general-purpose machine gun rare closed bolt position. Firing from a closed bolt contributes to accurate fire, but is disadvantageous for heat dissipation. The trigger group, which is integrated with the pistol grip and hinged from the receiver, is equipped with a fire control selector switch (selector lever in the \\"E\\" or \\"1\\" position ‚Äì semi-automatic fire, \\"F\\" or \\"20\\" ‚Äì continuous fire mode) that doubles as a manual safety (rotating the lever into the \\"S\\" or \\"0\\" setting disables the trigger, weapon is considered \\"safe\\"). The HK21 has a free- floating, heavy, quick-change barrel fitted with a slotted flash suppressor. The firearm is equipped with an iron sight line that consist of a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear aperture sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation from in increments for 7.62√ó51mm NATO models or in increments for 5.56√ó45mm NATO models. By simply swapping out several components such as the barrel, bolt and feed plate unit, the weapon can be quickly converted to the intermediate 7.62√ó39mm and 5.56√ó45mm NATO chamberings. =Feeding= The machine gun feeds from the left-hand side through a variety of disintegrating metallic link ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the German non-disintegrating metallic link DM1 belt. The ratcheting wheel feed unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the barrel axis. As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The feed mechanism is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt; a curved cam slot on the bottom of the bolt engages an actuator in the feed mechanism, rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K;'s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. Variants =G8 and G8A1= The German Army, German Navy and the Federal Police use a variant of the HK11 designated the Gewehr-8 (or G8). It is tapped for telescopic sights and has a quick-change barrel with a bipod that uses either a heavy match-grade bull-barrel or a heavy barrel for automatic fire. It was designed to use G3-type 10- or 20-round box magazines in the designated marksman role, but could also use a special 50-round drum magazine for sustained supporting or suppressing fire. The modified G8A1 adopted the improvements of the HK11A1 series and was only able to feed from magazines and drums. =GR-series= The GR-series were \\"sanitized\\" (i.e., having no serial numbers or identifying marks) Heckler & Koch weapons used by special operations forces. They differed from the stock weapons in that they had optical sights, no provisions for iron sights, and came standard in Woodland (-C suffix) or Desert (-S suffix) camouflage. *GR-6 Automatic Rifle (HK13). *GR-9 Light Machinegun (HK23). =HK21A1= In the early 1970s the HK21's design was simplified and the feed mechanism was modified. The machine gun's weight was increased, a carrying handle and a hooked buttstock with improved buffer mechanism were also added. The barrels were internally revised to polygonal rifling. Since then, the HK21 was offered in two main variants: the HK21A1 general-purpose machine gun (with a different belt feed mechanism) and the HK11A1 automatic rifle (optimized for magazine feed only). The HK11A1 proved more successful in export sales and was adopted by the Hellenic Army and several African and Asian armies. Both weapons, as in the original HK21, can be converted to chamber the 5.56√ó45mm NATO round by replacing the appropriate components. =HK21E= Vehicle mounted license-built HK21 in Mexican service During the 1980s both the HK21A1 and HK11A1 were modernized based on user and testing feedback, resulting in a new modular family of machine guns that share the same receiver, trigger group and interchangeable barrels and feed units, consisting of: *HK11E automatic rifle (magazine fed, chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO) *HK13E automatic rifle (magazine fed, chambered in 5.56√ó45mm NATO) *HK21E general-purpose machine gun (belt-fed, 7.62√ó51mm NATO), which is also license-built in Mexico for the armed forces *HK23E light machine gun (belt-fed, 5.56√ó45mm NATO). The \\"E\\" simply stands for \\"Export\\" model. They use STANAG rather than HK proprietary magazines and come with different optics than German military models. The E model is a thoroughly revised variant aimed to improve the reliability, efficiency and service life of the weapon. For this the length of the receiver was increased by to provide additional recoil length for the bolt group. The recoil reduction improved accuracy of fire. Reinforcing bars were added to the receiver to provide additional strength and a guaranteed 60,000 rounds minimum service life. The bolt head, extractor and locking roller holder were completely redesigned as were the bolt carrier and recoil spring assembly, belt feed unit, buffer, barrel and trigger group. The redesigned belt feed mechanism transports the ammunition belt in two steps reducing stress on the feed and ammunition belt. Compared to the older HK21A1 and HK11A1, the modernized \\"Export\\" weapons also feature a longer barrel shroud, extended by towards the front, which also resulted in a longer sight radius; the barrel extension was modified (the HK21E also received a longer barrel); a burst fire mode was incorporated into the trigger group as the fourth selector setting (3-round burst); a polymer barrel handle was added; space for a cleaning kit was added in the grip; the rear sight was modified with an adjustable drum; a bipod with a 3-position height adjustment and 30 degree tilt mechanisms replaced the simple folding bipod; the feed mechanism was modified to provide continuous feeding (by moving the belt in two stages, during both forward and rear movement of the bolt), a forward assist for silent loading was provided and the machine guns were adapted to use NATO-standard optical sight mounts. When employed in the light machine gun (infantry assault) role, the HK21E stores its ammunition belt in a 100-round sheet metal container, fastened to the bottom of the feed mechanism (as in the HK21A1). The ability to use G3 or STANAG (for HK23E) box or drum magazines is available with an optional feed module kit that consists of the bolt, recoil spring and belt feed module or magazine well. When employed in the belt-fed medium machine gun (fire support) role the HK21E provides a cook-off rate in excess of 1,000 rounds fired in quick succession. The shock-absorbing tripod weighs . =HK25= A heavy machine gun variant of the HK21 chambered in .50 BMG/12.7√ó99mm NATO was proposed but never went into production.http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/226/5036282.jpg =HK51B= An aftermarket conversion of an HK21 general purpose machinegun into a belt-fed short carbine created by gunsmiths F. J. Vollmer & Company Inc. The barrel is 8.9 inches long, has an overall length of 21 inches, weighs about 11 lbs. unloaded, and has a rate of fire of 950 to 1,000 rounds per minute. Fixed barrel models have a \\"Tropical\\" MP5-style handguard with ventilation slots. Quick-change barrel models have a four-position Picatinny Rail handguard (usually used with a vertical foregrip). It feeds from a 100-round HK21 belt box and uses either the American M13 or German DM6 disintegrating link belt. Vollmer only made 30 guns, 2 of which had quick-change barrels.

Henry F. Potter (commonly referred to as Mr. Potter or just Potter) is a fictional banker portrayed by veteran actor Lionel Barrymore in the 1946 Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life. Background Both Dan Duryea and Charles Bickford were considered for the role of \\"Potter\\".\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", American Film Institute Although Lionel Barrymore won an Academy Award for Best Actor in A Free Soul in 1931, in the 1940s he was well-known as the voice of Ebenezer Scrooge in CBS radio dramatizations of A Christmas Carol, and is now best remembered for his role as Henry Potter. A wheelchair-user due to a hip injury and severe arthritis, Barrymore played Potter as confined to a wheelchair due to polio. His wheelchair is pushed in all scenes by a wordless assistant (played by Frank Hagney). Story line Mr. Potter owns the bank and the transportation department in the fictitious Bedford Falls, as well as most of its businesses; the primary exception is the Bailey Building & Loan, in which Mr. Potter holds a minority stake. The Building & Loan is a constant source of aggravation for Mr. Potter, due to its inability to generate profits. As well, the Building & Loan's willingness to offer mortgages that the bank will not means many of the townsfolk leave Potter's rental properties (at times referred to as slums) in favor of people buying houses enabled by low interest loans from the Building & Loan. Mr. Potter is a large stockholder of the Building & Loan and has a seat on its board, giving him the ability to exert some influence on its operations. He mainly uses this influence to make several attempts to shut it down. He moves to dissolve the Building & Loan after the death of Peter Bailey, but after George Bailey makes an impassioned speech about the necessity of the Building & Loan in keeping Mr. Potter's activities in check, the board votes down the motion on the condition that George stay and run the company. As George and his new wife Mary, played by Donna Reed, start to leave on their honeymoon, a bank run commences, causing George and Mary to return to the Building & Loan. Mr. Potter calls in the bank's loan to the Building & Loan (ostensibly to provide his bank with cash, but also to empty the Building & Loan's coffers) and then offers its shareholders fifty cents on the dollar for their shares in an attempt to become the company's majority shareholder. This attempt is thwarted when George convinces the Building & Loan depositors to take only what cash they need, instead of demanding their entire deposit at once. He and Mary use their honeymoon savings to keep the Building & Loan open and solvent. In another attempt to weaken the Building & Loan, Mr. Potter offers George a job working directly for him, managing his affairs, at an extremely generous salary, and hints at the possibility of travel outside Bedford Falls, which George has always wanted to do and never has. George rejects the offer after Mr. Potter suggests that it would mean the end of the Building & Loan. Later, with World War II over and George's younger brother Harry Bailey scheduled to come home as a war hero, Mr. Potter encounters George's Uncle Billy at the bank, where Uncle Billy is making a deposit of $8,000 in cash. Gloating over the success story that the Baileys have become, Uncle Billy accidentally stuffs the cash into a newspaper that he hands to Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter recognizes the mistake upon returning to his office, and keeps the cash, knowing that the bank examiner is at the Building & Loan on a routine visit and the loss of $8,000 will have terrible ramifications for George. George later comes in desperation to Mr. Potter asking for a loan to cover the lost money; instead of returning it, Mr. Potter demands that George show collateral. The despondent George then reveals his sole liquid asset: $500 equity in a life insurance policy with a face value of $15,000. Mr. Potter's response is that George is worth more dead than alive. Exercising what he says is his duty as a Building & Loan stockholder, Mr. Potter then begins calling the police to report George for criminal malfeasance and misappropriation of funds. The defeated George leaves the scene. Later that night, Potter sees George once more, happy, as if he had never lost $8,000 and was positively overjoyed at the thought of a prison term. \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!\\" he shouts. Mr. Potter responds: \\"Happy New Year to you too ...In jail!\\" This is Mr. Potter's final scene in the movie. What Potter doesn't know is that George had just been shown a vision by his guardian angel (Clarence Odbody, played by Henry Travers). George was on the verge of suicide after his conference with Potter and wished that he had never been born. In response, his guardian angel showed him a vision of what would have become of Bedford Falls had George never been born: Potter has taken over the town and renamed it \\"Pottersville,\\" and it is a sleazy and dangerous place filled with whiskey joints, crime, pawnshops, violence, seedy entertainment establishments, and unhappy people with meaningless, amoral lives. This is the \\"thrifty working class\\" Potter had allegedly envisioned years earlier. When George returns to town, he has triumphed over Potter, because he finally realizes that all he has done for Bedford Falls has made him an important leader of his community, deeply respected and admired. This is evident when most of the town raises a collection to help make up the financial loss, culminating with a massive advance supplied by George's wealthy industrialist friend Sam Wainwright that more than makes up the difference. Even though Potter still remains George's business rival, the townspeople clearly support George rather than him, and it seems certain that the young Bailey will eventually be the more successful. Reception Richard Corliss of Time magazine described Barrymore's portrayal as, \\"... Scrooge, the Grinch and Simon Legree in one craggy, crabby package\\".Corliss, Richard. \\"Top 25 Greatest Villains \\", Time, April 25, 2007 Mr. Potter ranks at #6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 50 Greatest Villains in American film history.

Large areas of the country such as Puntland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia, while forces in the northwest declared the Republic of Somaliland. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. Somalia has been cited as a real-world example of a stateless society and a country with no formal legal system. The Transitional Federal Government, formed in 2004, was recognized as the central government of Somalia. Before December 2006, the TFG controlled only the town of Baidoa, the sixth largest city. The intervention of Ethiopian government forces following the rise of the Islamic Courts Union, culminating in the latter's defeat in the Battle of Baidoa, allowed the TFG to expand its control under the protection of Ethiopian troops. The TFG was at the time not able to effectively collect taxes, had no notable finances or real power base, and struggled to exert control over Mogadishu following an attempted move in late December 2006. However, the TFG later succeeded in capturing most of Somalia from insurgents, but struggled to cement its control and establish law and order. Benjamin Powell argued that statelessness led to more order and less chaos than had the previous state, and economist Alex Tabarrok claimed that Somalia in its stateless period provided a \\"unique test of the theory of anarchy\\", in some aspects near of that espoused by anarcho- capitalists David D. Friedman and Murray Rothbard, although this is disputed by various anarchists, of both the capitalist and anti-capitalist varieties, who contend it is not anarchy, but merely chaos, perhaps resulting from unequal distribution of power and meddling by neighbors and developed nations like the United States. The Somali experience since the collapse of the state, and especially the failure of international intervention, has offered a clear challenge to elements of conventional economic, political and social order theory and the very premises under which Western diplomacy and development agencies operate, and in particular, in the words of anthropologist Peter D. Little, \\"assumptions about the role of states in maintaining order and services\\".Little, P. (2003). Somalia: Economy without state. Oxford:International African Institute in association with James Currey. The rule of law Following the downfall of the Siad Barre government, there was effectively no formal monocentric government law in Somalia. While some urban areas such as Mogadishu had private police forces, many Somalis simply returned to the traditional clan-based legal structures for local governance and dispute resolution. Identified by The New York Times as \\"legendary individualists\\", Somalis have been thought of as particularly receptive to anarchist forms of social organisation; social scientists have identified the pastoralist way of life that a great many Somalis lead as in tension with formal statist legal systems.Mazrui, A. (1997). \\"Crisis in Somalia: From tyranny to anarchy.\\" In Adam, H. & Ford, R. (Eds.), Mending rips in the sky: Options for Somali communities in the 21st century (pp. 5‚Äì11). Lawrenceville, New Jersey: The Red Sea Press, Inc. Political loyalties are based on clan and region rather than political party, which, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs makes the sustainability of a centralised political system \\"difficult\\". Anthropologist Spencer MacCallum has identified the rule of law during the period as that of the Xeer, a customary law indigenous to Somalia. The law permits practices such as safe travel, trade, and marriage, which survives \\"to a significant degree\\" throughout Somalia, particularly in rural Somalia where it is \\"virtually unaffected\\". MacCallum credits the Xeer with \\"Somalia's success without a central government, since it provides an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development.\\" In the Xeer, law and crime are defined in terms of property rights; consequently the criminal justice system is compensatory rather than the punitive system of the majority of states, and the Xeer is \\"unequivocal in its opposition\\" to any form of taxation. Powell et al. (2006) find that the existence of the common law dispute resolution system in Somalia makes possible basic economic order. MacCallum compares the Xeer to the common law in 6th century Scotland, and notes that there is no monopoly of either police nor judicial services, a condition of polycentric law. However, a weakness of such a system is that it proves ineffective at handling disputes and enforcing resolutions that cross clan boundaries. For example, in a dispute involving telecommunications company Aerolite, the plaintiff from the weaker clan was unable to collect the \\"unfairly\\" small settlement they had been awarded. The absence of any effective coast guard to enforce maritime law, however, resulted in Somali international waters becoming an \\"international free-for- all\\", with piracy off the coast of Somalia in particular being the subject of international attention. Supporters of Somali piracy argue that they are reacting to illegal over-fishing and toxic waste dumping by foreign powers, and some pirate organisations have styled themselves as voluntarist defense organisations with names like National Volunteer Coastguard of Somalia and Somali Marines. Social conditions The international aid group M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res stated that the level of daily violence during this period was \\"catastrophic\\". While the homicide rate was significantly higher than in the US or in Europe, it was actually lower than in most of the African countries. A statistic from 2000 indicated that only 21% of the population had access to safe drinking water at that time, and Somalia had one of the highest child mortality rates in the world with 10% of children dying at birth and 25% of those surviving birth dying before age five. Additionally, \\"adult literacy is estimated to have declined from the already low level of 24% in 1989 to 17.1% in 2001.\\"World Bank Advisory Committee for Somalia Country Re-Engagement Note (pdf) (2003), retrieved 4 November 2005 A more recent 2003 study reported that the literacy rate was 19%. The impact on human development in Somalia of governmental collapse and ensuing civil war was profound, leading to the breakdown of political institutions, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure and massive internal and external migrations. According to a study by the libertarian think tank the Independent Institute: > In 2005, Somalia ranked in the top 50 percent in six of our 13 measures, and > ranked near the bottom in only three: infant mortality, immunization rates, > and access to improved water sources. This compares favorably with > circumstances in 1990, when Somalia last had a government and was ranked in > the bottom 50 percent for all seven of the measures for which we had that > year's data: death rate, infant mortality, life expectancy, main telephone > lines, tuberculosis, and immunization for measles and DTP.\\" The libertarian think tank the Mises Institute also repeatedly praised Somalia, as has the Libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. Prior to the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s, Somalia's life expectancy was approximately equal to neighboring Ethiopia. As of 2014, after a quarter of a century of minimal government, life expectancy in Somalia was 9 years behind Ethiopia. However, both of them improved drastically. Social organization In the absence of functioning governmental institutions and regulations, they were supplanted by the private sector and clan law. Commentators identify evidence of areas where the private sector adapted to the stateless environment. A 2004 World Bank study of the Somali economy concluded that \\"it may be easier than is commonly thought for basic systems of finance and some infrastructure services to function where government is extremely weak or absent.\\" The New York Times referred to post-state Mogadishu as \\"the ultimate example of deregulation,\\" noting that \\"[g]utsy entrepreneurs, including some women, opened their own hospitals, schools‚Ä¶ telephone companies, power plants and ports\\". =Communications= Private media enterprises ‚Äì such as Haatuf newspaper from Hargeisa shown here ‚Äì rapidly grew in the aftermath of state collapse. In the absence of government service provision and regulation, private businessmen stepped in to provide telecommunications and mail services. In 2007 parts of Somalia had some of the best voice telecommunications in Africa, with 10 or more competing companies ready to wire home or office and provide crystal-clear service, including international long distance, for about $10 a month.\\" According to the CIA World Factbook, private telephone companies \\"offer service in most major cities\\" via wireless technology, charging \\"the lowest international rates on the continent\\", Installation time for a land-line was just three days, while in neighboring Kenya waiting lists were many years long. On the other hand, just 0.7% of the population of Somalia had access to internet in 2006, a sixth of Kenya's internet penetration at the time,Christian Fuchs, Eva Horak, Africa and the Digital Divide http://fuchs.uti.at/wp-content/uploads/divide.pdf and in 2007 mobile phone penetration rates in Somalia were amongst the lowest in Africa. The Economist argued the lack of telecommunication regulation in Somalia represented \\"a vivid illustration of the way in which governments‚Ä¶can often be more of a hindrance than a help\\" to private entrepreneurs. Abdullahi Mohammed Hussein of Telecom Somalia stated that \\"the government post and telecoms company used to have a monopoly but after the regime was toppled, we were free to set up our own business\\", though he also commented that he would be \\"interested in paying taxes\\" if an incoming government improved the security situation. =Utilities= Since 1991 Somalia has lacked a functioning central electricity grid, but private entrepreneurs have offered electricity generation on a localised basis, typically offering a choice of daytime, evening or 24-hour electricity. Gaalkacyo, a desert town in central Somalia, was provided with streetlights by local entrepreneur Abdirizak Osman, who expanded his enterprises from telecommunications to power generators, not only lighting the town but also supplying free electricity to the local hospital. Private entrepreneurs have also collected and distributed water, although due to a lack of purification there is little access to safe water. =Media= Since the fall of the government, dozens of private newspapers, radio and television stations rapidly grew (Mogadishu has two fiercely competing TV stations), with private radio stations or newspapers in almost all major towns. =Transport= Multiple private airlines, including Air Somalia, Jubba Airways and Daallo Airlines, emerged to serve the Somali market. According to a 2005 World Bank report, the \\"private airline business in Somalia is now thriving with more than five carriers and price wars between the companies.\\" Mohammed Yassin Olad, owner of Daallo Airlines, stated that the absence of government has led to both difficulties and benefits, and commented that \\"corruption is not a problem, because there is no government‚Ä¶We build the airports and we service the airports and we only fly when we are sure it's safe\\". Concurrently, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Development Programme managed Somalia's airspace through the Civil Aviation Caretaker Authority for Somalia. The expansion of the aviation industry was accompanied by the disruption of road transport; many roads are frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) in order to allow the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50 km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu. Most of the money is used to buy khat, a drug used by the militiamen, and weapons such as AK-47 and RPG-7. Bosaso in relatively stable autonomous Puntland emerged as a regional hub and major port. A small fishing village prior to the fall of the state, Bosaso developed a lucrative import/export trade of U.S. $15 million per year out of its port during the 1990s. The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community. =Education= In a 2007 study of the state of education in Somalia since the collapse of central authority in 1991, Abdullahi Sheikh Abdinoor found that \\"the Somali people have adapted rather well, under the circumstances, to the absence of the state, despite continuing insecurity and lawlessness prevailing in the country.\\" Following the destruction of educational systems and infrastructure during the civil war, many new educational institutions were opened by community members, private enterprises and Islamic NGOs. For centuries, the Somali community, as opposed to the state, has been in charge of Islamic education in all aspects, providing financial and administrative support. The majority of the schools are provided by the free market, sustained by school fees (typically $10 per month); in cases where there are state-supported public schools, private schools are often coveted for their academic excellence, outperforming their public competitors in academic achievement tests. By 2005 there were 1,172 primary schools, but levels of enrollment that were low even by African standards with only around 17‚Äì19% of schoolchildren in primary education. Nevertheless, this level of primary enrollment was approaching pre-war levels, with secondary school enrollment also showing an increase since 1998. In Mogadishu, the Somalia National University, Benadir University and the Mogadishu University are three of the eight universities providing tertiary education in Southern Somalia, with the latter two institutions founded during the stateless period. A money exchange center in Hargeisa, Somaliland. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money exchange services have sprung up throughout the country, handling about $1 billion in remittances annually. =Currency= Rival producers of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove the value of the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases. The relatively stable value of the currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting from the lack of a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of Somali shillings by converting them to U.S. dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired money are required to answer questions about their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down. With the establishment of the Transitional National Government in 2000, a group of businessmen imported about 30 billion shillings of Canadian-printed notes, sparking a collapse of the currency and wide-scale demonstrations and protests in Mogadishu. The value declined by 30 percent (to 13,000 per $1) in three months, and by the end of 2001 the currency had fallen to about SoSh 22,000 per US dollar. Further imports of money caused additional disruption and the TNG was forced to buy up large amounts of money. In the autonomous northwestern Somaliland region, the Somaliland shilling Is used as currency. It hasn't been recognized as legal tender by the international community, and had no official exchange rate. It is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the enclave's central bank. Although the separatist authorities in Somaliland attempted to bar usage of the Somali shilling, Somalia's official currency remained the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.Time for Somaliland to Rethink its Strategy Economic conditions Bakaara Market in the heart of Mogadishu. In the absence of government regulation, Somali marketplaces have thrived. Although it states that no reliable statistics are available for the period in question, the United Nations claims that Somalia, already one of the poorest countries in the world, has become even poorer as a result of civil war. However, the CIA Factbook maintains that gains were made during the early 2000s; \\"despite the seeming anarchy, Somalia's service sector has managed to survive and grow. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food and khat to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate, and militias provide security.\\" When extreme poverty (percentage of individuals living on less than PPP$1 a day) was last measured by the World Bank in 1998, Somalia fared better than many other countries in Africa, over some of whom Somalia also had superior infrastructure. The CIA World Factbook counsels that \\"Statistics on Somalia's GDP, growth, per capita income, and inflation should be viewed skeptically\\", while estimating Somalia's GDP per capita at $600. In the absence of a Somali state and its institutions, the private sector grew \\"impressively\\" according to the World Bank in 2003, particularly in the areas of trade, commerce, transport, remittance and infrastructure services and in the primary sectors, notably in livestock, agriculture and fisheries. In 2007, the United Nations reported that the country's service industry is also thriving. Economist Peter T. Leeson, in an event study of \\"the impact of anarchy on Somali development\\", found that \\"[t]he data suggest that while the state of this development remains low, on nearly all of 18 key indicators that allow pre- and post-stateless welfare comparisons, Somalis are better off under anarchy than they were under government.\\" Powell et al. concur that in absolute terms, Somalia's living standards have improved and compare favorably with many existing African states, but also report that living standards have often improved \\"relative to other African countries since the collapse of the Somali central government.\\" Islamic courts Political map of Somalia in December 2006 showing the political structure of the Islamic Courts Union at the height of its power during the Somali Civil War. Following the collapse of centralized government, much of the legal system and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries in the age of the War on Terror, the CIA funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court. Transitional Federal Government The Transitional Federal Government was internationally recognized as the government of Somalia until August 2012, when it was replaced by the Federal Government of Somalia. It was established in 2004 as a successor to the now defunct Transitional National Government, and currently occupies Somalia's seat in the United Nations. The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces are fighting to quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern half of the country, as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement Shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.Shariah in Somalia ‚Äì Arab News See also *Consolidation of states within Somalia (1998‚Äì2006) *Kritarchy *Piracy in Somalia *Politics of Somalia *List of anarchist communities *Human rights in Somalia References Further reading * * External links * Who Needs Government?

The family is considered cosmopolitan in distribution, with the highest species concentrations in subtropical and moderate climate zones. Stephanidae also contain four extinct genera described from both compression fossils and inclusions in amber. Biology Stephanids are noted for their ocellar corona, a semicircular to circular set of projections around the middle ocellus, forming a \\"crown\\" on the head. Only stephanids and the similarly old Hymenoptera family Orussidae have ocellar coronae, and it is uncertain if they developed the structure separately or if a common ancestor of both developed it and it was then lost in all but the two families. Weakly developed grooves starting at the base of the antennae and extending past the eyes to the back of the head capsule are present. This feature is seen more developed in hymenopteran families in which the adults emerge from pupal chambers in wood. All genera of Stephanidae have a pronotum that is modified to some extent. They bear highly modified hind legs, with a swollen hind femur that has large teeth on the underside, and the tibiae have a tip end that widens distinctly. The largest species, reaching up to in length, are found in the genus Megischus. Stephanids are noted as parasitoids of xylophagous beetle larvae, with a majority of the stephanids hosts coming from the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae, though some Curculionidae and occasional hymenopteran hosts are taken. One species, Schlettererius cinctipes, is a known parasitoid of horntail wasps and has been introduced to Tasmania as a biological pest control agent. Members of the genus Foenatopus are parasitoids of Agrilus sexsignatus, wood-boring beetle larvae found infesting eucalyptus in the Philippines. The rate of parasitism for an A. sexsignatus population was recorded to vary from only 2% up to 50% of the population. Taxonomy and fossil record The family is noted to be the most basal group of hymenopterans in the suborder Apocrita. Sharkey et. al. (2012) Phylogenetic relationships among superfamilies of Hymenoptera. Cladistics 28: 80-112. They are the only living group left over from the early diversification of Apocrita. In general, the family is considered rare, with close to 95% of the species known to have been described from single specimens. Until the early 1800s, members of Stephanidae were grouped into the parasitic wasp superfamily Ichneumonoidea based on the superficial resemblance between some members of the two groups. William Elford Leach suggested a new family grouping for the stephanids in the 1815 edition of Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia. The name Stephanidae was first published by Alexander Henry Haliday in his 1839 Hymenoptera Britannica. About 110 years later, the stephanids were placed into a separate superfamily, Stephanoidea, by P.L.G. Benoit, along with the proposed family \\"Stenophasmidae\\". The latter group was moved out of Stephanoidea in 1969 by Alexandr Pavlovich Rasnitsyn, who transferred the \\"Stenophasmidae\\" to the family Braconidae and synonymized the two families. Fossil specimens related to the family are uncommon, and most are dated to the Tertiary. The oldest confirmed members of the family are Kronostephanus zigrasi, Lagenostephanus lii, and Phoriostephanus exilis all known from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Burmese amber. Other early member of the family is the monotypic genus Archaeostephanus, which is known from a single species Archaeostephanus corae found in the late Cretaceous New Jersey amber and first described in 2004. The first species to be described from the fossil record was Protostephanus ashmeadi, which was first published in 1906 by paleoentomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell. The specimen is also the youngest fossil found, dating from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation. All other extinct species in the family are known from fossils preserved in Baltic amber. Based on the fossil record of the family, Li et al. (2017) infer that the family originated during the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous. Taxonomy of the family as outlined by Michael S.

Early life Phillips was born on May 30, 1878 in Beverly, Massachusetts. His parents were John Charles Phillips, Jr. (1838‚Äì1885), who married Anna Tucker in London, England on October 23, 1874. His older brother was John Charles Phillips (1876‚Äì1938), a prominent zoologist, ornithologist and environmentalist. He had two sisters, Anna Tucker Phillips, who was married to Raynal Bolling (1877-1918) (the first American officer killed in WWI), and Martha Phillips, who was married to Andrew James Peters (1872‚Äì1938) (a U.S. Congressman and former Mayor of Boston). Phillips was a member of the Boston Brahmin Phillips family and his ancestors included John Phillips, the first Mayor of Boston and his great-grandfather, Wendell Phillips, the abolitionist and his grand-uncle, and Samuel Phillips, Jr., and John Phillips, founders of the Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy.

Career His first political job was working as a private secretary in London to Joseph Hodges Choate, the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James. Choate was a friend of Phillips' family and also from Massachusetts. Phillips subsequently went to work for the United States Minister to China in Beijing. After his return from China, he became a member of President Theodore Roosevelt's Tennis Cabinet and thanks to his previous diplomatic experience and new friendship with TR was assigned to set up the State Department's Division of Far Eastern Affairs and was made its first chief. In 1909, he returned to work in London for Ambassador Whitelaw Reid. In 1914, he was appointed as Assistant Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson and remained in that position until 1920, when he was made the Minister Plenipotentiary to Netherlands and Luxembourg (in residence in the Netherlands). From 1922 to 1924, he served as Under Secretary of State. In 1924, he was appointed as Ambassador to Belgium, where he remained until 1927, when he became the first Minister to Canada, until 1929. He served as Under Secretary of State again from 1933 to 1936. Photograph by Harris & Ewing of American ambassadors after holding a conference with President Franklin D.

Eisenhower, with the rank of ambassador. Phillips retired officially in 1944 but returned briefly to diplomatic life in 1945 when he was made a special assistant to Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, Jr. In 1946, he served on the Anglo-American Committee on Palestine, opposing the British plan for partitioning the country. In 1947, he was unsuccessful in mediating a border dispute between Siam and French Indo- China. In 1953, his memoir, Ventures in Diplomacy, was published by the Beacon Press. Personal life In 1910, Phillips married Caroline Astor Drayton (1880‚Äì1965), the daughter of Charlotte Augusta Astor (1858‚Äì1920) and J. Coleman Drayton (1852‚Äì1934) and a granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor Jr. (1829‚Äì1892) and Caroline Webster Schermerhorn (1830‚Äì1908). Through her father, she was a great-granddaughter of U.S. Representative William Drayton (1776‚Äì1846). Together, they were the parents of: * Beatrice Schermerhorn Phillips (1914‚Äì2003), who married Rear Adm. Elliott Bowman Strauss (1903-2003), in 1951. * William Phillips, Jr. (1916‚Äì1991), who married Barbara Holbrook (1915‚Äì1997), in 1941. * Drayton Phillips (1917‚Äì1985), who married Evelyn Gardiner in 1940. * Christopher Hallowell Phillips (1920‚Äì2008), served as United States Ambassador to Brunei from 1989 to 1991. * Anne Caroline Phillips (1922‚Äì2016), who married John Winslow Bryant (1914‚Äì1999), in 1942.

It opened in 1969, the same year as its main competitor, Lansing Mall, on the other end of the Lansing metropolitan area. The mall originally featured the J.W. Knapp Company and Woolco as its anchor stores, and underwent many expansions over the years. A G. C. Murphy dime store was subdivided for additional mall space in 1979, while J.W. Knapp sold its store to JCPenney a year later. Expansions in 1982 and 1987 added two more wings of stores anchored by Hudson's (later Marshall Field's, now Macy's) and Mervyn's, while the closure of Woolco allowed for the addition of a food court and Service Merchandise. Further renovations at the beginning of the 21st century relocated the food court and replaced Service Merchandise with Jacobson's, while also adding Galyan's (now Dick's Sporting Goods) and several other big-box stores. After only two years in business, the Jacobson's store closed and converted to Younkers; following the closure of Mervyn's in 2006, Younkers expanded its presence in the mall by moving some departments into that space, until parent company The Bon-Ton filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and closed all stores. Meridian Mall features about 125 stores and a food court, plus a movie theater on its periphery. The mall's anchor stores are High Caliber Karting and Entertainment, JCPenney, Launch Trampoline Park, Macy's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Schuler Books & Music, and Dick's Sporting Goods. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Younkers. Other major tenants include H&M; and Planet Fitness. Meridian Mall is owned and managed by CBL Properties, which has owned it since 1998. History Meridian Mall was built by the M.H. Hausman Company and opened to the public on November 6, 1969. The mall was built at the northwest corner of Grand River Avenue (M-43) and Marsh Road in Meridian Charter Township. Originally, the mall featured two anchor stores: the Lansing-based J.W. Knapp Company (Knapp's) and Woolco, a discount department store then owned by the F. W. Woolworth Company. Major tenants at the time included the Meridian 4, a four- screen movie theater multiplex operated by American Multi-Cinema (now AMC Theatres), along with a G. C. Murphy dime store, a Cunningham Drug pharmacy, and a Hamady supermarket. Two local restaurants, Schensul's Cafeteria and Elias Brothers Big Boy, also had locations in the mall. The Hamady store was closed in 1972 and remained vacant until 1976, when it was converted to a second movie theater complex that also featured four screens. This newer theater became known as Meridian East 4, while the existing ones were renamed Meridian West 4. In 1979, the G. C. Murphy store was closed and its space was divided into a new mall section consisting of twelve shops, known as \\"The Court\\". Among the first stores to open in The Court were CardAmerica, Casual Corner, and MC Sports. =The 1980s= J. W. Knapp filed for bankruptcy in 1980 and sold all three of its shopping mall stores (in Meridian Mall, Lansing Mall, and Jackson's Westwood Mall) to JCPenney. A new wing was added to the south end of Meridian Mall in 1982, bringing in the Detroit-based Hudson's as a third anchor. New tenants in the Hudson's wing included several clothing stores and a Foot Locker, while the existing mall was refurbished with new planters, flooring, seating, skylights, and canopies over the mall entrances. Later in 1982, the F. W. Woolworth Company closed all stores in the Woolco division, and in 1983, the vacated Woolco space was subdivided for a Service Merchandise catalog showroom, a food court, and a mall corridor with space for up to fifteen more tenants. Among these tenants was a local men's clothing and sporting goods store known as B. Altman's. A 1987 expansion added another new wing ending in a Mervyn's department store. The store opened concurrently with seven others in the state, one of which was located at Lansing Mall, as part of the chain's introduction to Michigan. This addition at Meridian Mall included more than ten new storefronts, including Lerner New York (now known as New York & Company), LensCrafters, Babbage's (now known as GameStop), and new locations for Gantos and County Seat. =1990s-early 2000s= Meridian Mall side entrance from west end of building By 1993, expansions at Lansing Mall had created significant competition between the two malls; that year, the approximately 60 businesses had stores at both malls, and 40 unique to each. One of the few renovations to Meridian Mall during the 1990s came in 1995, when Hobie's restaurant was removed from the food court to accommodate more seating. Additions in 1996 included Abercrombie & Fitch, Select Comfort, and the first Kirkland's home furnishings store in Michigan. On August 27, 1998, CBL & Associates Properties (now known as CBL Properties) acquired Meridian Mall.CBL & Associates Properties Acquires Two Malls in Michigan and Wisconsin Immediately afterward, several new tenants joined the mall, including The Children's Place, Mrs. Fields, Braun's Fashions (now known as Christopher & Banks), and the first Ann Taylor and Old Navy stores in the Lansing area. Service Merchandise closed its Meridian Mall store in early 1999. A $20 million mall renovation began in 2000, which added new floor tiles, skylights, seating areas, and restrooms, along with many new stores. One of the key tenants in this renovation plan was a two-story Jacobson's department store, which opened in early 2000 on the former site of Service Merchandise, and replaced an existing Jacobson's in downtown East Lansing. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond built a store in the same wing, the food court was relocated to center court, and the Hudson's was expanded by . Shortly after receiving the expansion, Hudson's was renamed to Marshall Field's when parent company Target Corporation began consolidating the names of its department stores. The new food court opened in November 2000, with restaurants including A&W;, Sbarro, Olga's Kitchen, Panda Express, and Arby's. The remaining restaurants from the old food court stayed until year's end, when that space was removed for Schuler Books & Music, replacing their previous location across the street. Galyan's, a sporting goods store based out of Indiana, opened next to the new food court in 2002. Coinciding with the addition of these stores, the mall also added Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Steve & Barry's, Hollister Co., and an AT&T; Wireless store, while Bailey Banks & Biddle, MC Sports, and several locally-owned stores closed. The site occupied by Galyan's was originally to have been occupied by a new multiplex theater, but this was canceled due to concerns that major theater chains were overbuilding. Prior to the renovation, both of the existing theaters in the mall had closed: Meridian East 4 in December 1999, and Meridian West 4 in July 2000. Jacobson's declared bankruptcy in 2002 and closed. A year later, its building was tenanted by Younkers, which also opened at Lansing Mall the same year. Due to space limitations in the old Jacobson's, Younkers operated its men's and children's departments in a newly-created, adjacent storefront. This expansion displaced the mall offices, which operated out of a temporary location in the Mervyns wing for a short time, until the Steve & Barry's store was relocated to the JCPenney wing and the previous location was remodeled into a new mall office. =Mid 2000s-2020s= In 2004, Dick's Sporting Goods acquired and renamed all of the Galyan's stores. Two more changes came to the mall's anchors in 2006; first, in early 2006, Mervyn's closed all of its Michigan stores, and later the same year, Marshall Field's was one of several chains to be acquired and renamed by Macy's. Younkers expanded its presence at the mall in mid-2008 by moving its men's clothing, children's clothing, and furniture departments into the vacated Mervyn's space, while retaining women's clothing and accessories at the existing store. This two-store concept, referred to by parent company The Bon-Ton as a \\"dual anchor\\", alleviated the congested layout of the existing store, while allowing a greater variety of merchandise to be offered between the two locations. Steve & Barry's closed at the mall in September 2008. The former Meridian Mall Outer 6 AMC movie theater on the mall's periphery closed its doors on September 5, 2011. The theater reopened in December 2012 as Studio C!, offering drinks and made-to-order food ordered and served at patrons' seats. In late 2013, plans were approved to add H&M; and Gordmans to the mall sometime in 2014. Planet Fitness and Shoe Carnival both opened in the Macy's wing in late 2013. On April 29, 2017, Gordmans closed their Meridian Mall location due to bankruptcy. Launch Trampoline Park was announced as its replacement in mid-2018. The Bon-Ton filed for bankruptcy in mid-2018, and began liquidation of all its stores, including both Younkers locations at Meridian Mall. In mid-2019, High Caliber Karting and Entertainment announced that it would open in the former Younkers Men's & Home store. In early 2020, Old Navy closed, and High Caliber plans to expand into the resulting vacancy. On June 23, 2020, JCPenney announced that it would be closing as part of a plan to close 13 stores nationwide after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. However, JCPenney cancelled the store's closing in early July.

It was the original home of the Austin Museum of Art and still houses some of its collections. The building is now one of two sites of The Contemporary Austin. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. History Before the influx of white settlers, Native Americans visited the site for its nearby spring (today underwater). The land that includes the property was originally owned by Stephen F. Austin, who in 1832 (seven years before Austin was founded) wrote that he wished to build a home there. This never came to pass. In 1914 the property was purchased by Hal Sevier, editor of the Austin American, with his new wife Clara Driscoll. They completed their villa two years later, inspired by a honeymoon visit to Lake Como in Italy. Clara, an avid gardener, spent many years planting native and foreign plants around the site and designing the terraced gardens that remain to this day. In 1943 Driscoll donated the homesite to be used as a city museum. In 1961, the site was converted to the Laguna Gloria Art Museum and became an important part of the Austin arts scene. Soon after, the museum began offering art classes, and in 1983, a facility was built specifically for the growing art school. In 1992, the institution changed its name to the Austin Museum of Art, and four years later, moved its primary exhibition space to 823 Congress Avenue, in the heart of downtown Austin. Laguna Gloria remained the site of The Art School, and in 2003, the Driscoll Villa was renovated and again became an exhibition space, focusing on local and regional artists. The site is immediately adjacent to Mayfield Park, also on the National Register of Historic Places.

E.ON UK is the second largest electricity and gas supplier in the UK and one of the Big Six energy suppliers. It was founded in 1989 as Powergen, and was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has been a subsidiary of E.ON since 1 July 2002.E.ON completes Its acquisition of Powergen E.ON, was formerly a vertically integrated utility company with interests in electrical generation, electricity distribution in the Midlands region, and in the electricity and gas supply markets. It took a pioneering role in the development of large scale renewables including the construction and operation of the UK's first offshore wind farm at Blyth in Northumberland. It became one of the first in the world, and the first major UK energy company, to significantly alter its structure by spinning off its fossil generation business so it could focus on energy supply, grid development and renewables. History Powergen was formed in 1989 as a Public Limited Company which was wholly owned by the UK government and acquired about 50% of the Central Electricity Generating Board generating capacity. Sir Robert Malpas was Chairman of the Group from 1989 to 1991.'MALPAS, Sir Robert', in Who's Who 2012 (London: A. & C. Black, 2012) Sixty per cent of Powergen was sold to private investors in 1991, followed by the remaining 40% in March 1995. It expanded considerably by acquiring the regional electricity company East Midlands Electricity in 1998Powergen buys East Midlands and the supply business of TXU Energi in 2002.Powergen buys TXU's British arm Powergen was eventually taken over itself by E.ON, an acquisition which was completed in January 2002. It then bought the distribution network operator Midlands Electricity in 2004.Powergen to buy Midlands Electricity This was merged with the distribution business of East Midlands Electricity and rebranded as Central Networks. The Industrial & Commercial Retail business was rebranded as E.ON UK on 5 July 2004. The creation of the Central Networks business in April 2004 included \\"a company of E.ON\\" as part of its logotype. In October 2005 it was also added to the Powergen logotype. In June 2007, a major advertising campaign entitled \\"The wind of change\\", containing advertisements using the E.ON logo, was launched. The campaign featured the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm in the Solway Firth, currently in development. In the consumer market, this was complemented by a replacement of the mostly blue Powergen identity to the red identity of E.ON, and the launch of a new product, Go Green, using electricity from renewable sources and carbon offset gas. On 22 October 2007, the company announced that the E.ON Energy and Powergen brands would change to E.ON as of 1 November and 3 December 2007 respectively. In January 2008, E.ON acquired West Midlands-based CHN Group, a provider of heating services to builders, local authorities and housing associations across the region.E.ON buys CHN and in August 2008 completed the purchase of the Street Lighting business lighting projects of ABB Ltd. It intended to improve its existing lighting business by purchasing ABB.Wragge & Co advises E.ON on street lighting deal In 2008 and 2009 a number of protests took place at E.ON UK's power station including a Climate Camp at their Kingsnorth power station in August 2008Plans for Kingsnorth push ahead and at their Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in October 2009. =Restructuring= On 20 January 2010, E.ON UK announced the closure of its Rayleigh Customer Service Centre and the loss of 600 jobs. The company was forced to bring forward the announcement by one day after the information was leaked to a local newspaper. This has been criticised as a money-saving exercise by an organisation which has seen an increase in profits of 18% in 2009 and news that E.ON UK have made ¬£80 million in profits so far in the financial year 2009/10. Other businesses within E.ON were also affected by these round of job losses, including its IT support and its Highways Lighting operations. In March 2011, E.ON sold Central Networks to PPL's UK subsidiary Western Power Distribution for ¬£3.5 billion. In October 2012, E.ON sold its 50% stake in Horizon Nuclear Power to Hitachi for ¬£348 million. The other 50% stake, held by RWE npower, was also sold to Hitachi for the same amount, giving a total sale value of ¬£696 million. Late in 2012, E.ON UK announced the closure of the 'Ignite' business, originally tasked with bringing alternative localised-generation products to market for E.ON UK. In 2013, E.ON Home Energy Services was sold in a management buyout. =Acquisition of Npower= Just after the failed SSE-Npower merger of retail assets in late 2018, it was reported that the Big Six energy suppliers would still consolidate to the Big Five, as Npower would be acquired by default by E.on UK, due to the already-planned asset swap of the respective German parents Innogy and E.ON. Operations The company's headquarters are in Coventry at Westwood Business Park, in a building designed by Bennetts Associates. There are numerous other offices and power generation sites across the country. UK businesses E.ON UK's businesses consist of: *Energy Solutions (a merger of the former Retail and Energy Services businesses) *Business Services (an internal service provider) *Central functions including Corporate Affairs & Finance under the banner UK Centre *E.ON Climate and Renewables ‚Äì renewables and climate protection projects *E.ON IT UK ‚Äì the company's IT service provider =Generation= E.ON operates a number of onshore and offshore wind farms, biomass power stations, Combined Heat and Power plants in the UK. It formerly ran a number of fossil plants which are now wholly owned and run by Uniper. Sponsorship =ITV National Weather= Powergen/E.ON sponsored the ITV National Weather forecasts from its launch on 13 February 1989 until 31 December 2007, a period of 18 years. They were known for their memorable sponsorship sequences from a set introduced on 5 April 1993 which featured weather themes circulating around (or parts of) the Powergen logo, and from 20 November 1996, the Weathergens, a \\"mascot\\" of Powergen representing different types of weather. After several different sets of idents throughout the 2000s, Powergen eventually became E.ON in 2007 and the sponsorship was changed to accommodate the name change. The sponsorship ended on 31 December 2007 and from 4 July 2016 to 8 July 2018, ITV National Weather was sponsored by rival energy company SSE on all ITV plc stations and UTV. =Sport= In 2006, E.ON UK announced that it was to be the sponsor of the FA Cup for a four-year period. During this period, the competition is formally called \\"The FA Cup sponsored by E.ON\\". Before 2006, the company had sponsored the rugby union and rugby league cup competitions under the Powergen brand. The original four-year deal was extended to a fifth year as the Football Association failed to secure a new sponsor. The announcement was unpopular as it was made in the same week as the confirmation of closure of the Rayleigh Call Centre. The company was the energy partner of the Football League, and sponsors the E.ON Lounge at the Ricoh Arena, the home of Coventry City F.C. Football Club. In other sports, E.ON UK sponsored the Tour of Britain cycling championship from 2007 to 2009, and in 2007 launched a campaign with Ellen MacArthur to encourage energy efficiency within businesses. Distribution network operators E.ON UK is an energy supplier for homes across the country. They do not however manage the network of towers and cables that distributes electricity ‚Äì these are maintained by distribution network operators (DNOs) which vary from region to region.

He is generally assumed to have been the commander of the praetorians under Gallienus. However, the sources only tell us that he was made the guardian of the Caesar Saloninus by Saloninus's father, the Emperor Gallienus. This seems likely to mean that he exercised a guiding influence over his young prot√©g√© as he represented the Imperial Dynasty in the government of the Gallic provinces. In this respect Silvanus/Albanus may be compared with Ingenuus who seems to have exercised a similar function, in loco parentis, in the command of the Danubian provinces by Saloninus's elder brother, the Caesar Valeriannus, earlier in the 250s. He would not have been given this office had he not been a seasoned soldier and administrator, but this does not mean that he was Gallienus's Praetorian Prefect. It was Parker who supposed that Silvanus/Albanus must have held that office. This suggestion has since been generally accepted without question by academic opinion. However, while his command was clearly above that of a provincial governor, there is no proof that this was the case. Being Praetorian Prefect was not a necessary condition of being made the guardian of a Licinian Dynasty Caesar: it has never been seriously suggested that Ingenuus, who seems to have been similarly in loco parentis in respect of Saloninus's brother, the Caesar Valerian in the Danubian provinces, was so honoured. Praetorian Prefect or not, in 260 Silvanus/Albanus fell into dispute with Postumus over the disposition of loot which the latter had seized from a group of German raiders in Gaul. Postumus's army, infuriated, then proclaimed their man Emperor and attacked Silvanus/Albanus and the young Caesar in Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (modernday Cologne). The pair were eventually given up by the citizens and killed by Postumus's men.

He specialised in studies of Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Tamils, as well as the anthropology of religion and politics.  Biography  Tambiah was born in Sri Lanka to a Christian Tamil family. He attended S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia for his primary and secondary education. After finishing his undergraduate education at the University of Ceylon in 1951, he attended Cornell University, graduating in 1954 with a PhD. He began teaching sociology at the University of Ceylon in 1955, where he remained until 1960. After a few years as the UNESCO Teaching Assistant for Thailand, he taught at the University of Cambridge from 1963 to 1972 and at the University of Chicago from 1973 to 1976. He joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1976. His earliest major published work was an ethno-historical study of modern and medieval Thailand. He then became interested in the comparative study of the ways Western categories of magic, science and religion have been used by anthropologists to make sense of other cultures which do not use this three- part system. After the outbreak of civil war in Sri Lanka, he began to study the role of competing religious and ethnic identities in that country. At Harvard, he trained several generations of anthropologists in a number of fields. He also served on the National Research Council's Committee for International Conflict Resolution. He did field research on the Organisation of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka (Monks, Priests and Peasants, a Study of Buddhism and Social Structure in Central Ceylon and several papers in the American Anthropologists and the Journal of Asian Studies).  Awards  In November 1997, Tambiah received the prestigious Balzan Prize for \\"penetrating social-anthropological analysis of the fundamental problems of ethnic violence in South East Asia and original studies on the dynamics of Buddhist societies [that] have opened the way to an innovative and rigorous social- anthropological approach to the internal dynamics of different civilizations\\". A month later, the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland awarded him its highest recognition, the Huxley Memorial Medal and Lecture. In September 1998, he was awarded the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize by the city of Fukuoka, capital of Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. In 2000, he became a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy, a title given to those who have \\"attained high international standing\\" in a discipline in the humanities or social sciences.

It is known from the description of a rusty-red pigeon given by Dubois in 1674 and a single subfossil humerus that agrees with that of the pink pigeon of Mauritius in generic characteristics, except being slightly longer. Also, Dubois' reference to the bill being red at the base and the eyes being surrounded by a red ring suggest that this species was closely allied to the Mauritus taxon. Dubois' description was as follows: Its genus Nesoenas was often synonymized with Columba in the past, but more recently it has been synonymized with Streptopelia. As the pink pigeon and the Malagasy turtle dove cannot be firmly placed in either of these two genera but apparently represent a distinct lineage that diverged early, probably from the ancestor of Streptopelia, it seems (at least for the time being) to be best to separate them again in Nesoenas. This restores the genus of the R√©union pink pigeon to the one it was originally described under. There seem to have been one to three other species of columbid on R√©union (not counting the invalidated \\"R√©union solitaire\\"). Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe mentioned ramiers (doves) with blue wings in 1619 as being abundant; apparently a species of Alectroenas. Dubois, on the other hand, referred to no less than four kinds of pigeons: ramiers, tourterelles (turtle doves) and two kinds of pigeon, one rusty red - the present species -, the other slate grey. Either the ramiers or the tourterelles of Dubois could refer to a local population of the Madagascar turtle dove, possibly an extinct subspecies, which is known from one subfossil humerus and one ulna. The slate-grey bird or the ramiers, respectively, seem to be the birds described by Bontekoe. What the remaining form - the tourterelles or the slate-grey pigeons, respectively - might have been is completely unresolvable at this time, although the possibility of it being a relative of the Rodrigues pigeon cannot be entirely discounted. Extinction Since the R√©union pink pigeon was only mentioned explicitly by Dubois, little can be said about its extinction. The last reports of native pigeons were by P√®re Bernardin in 1687 and by Guillaume Houssaye in 1689, although the Alectroenas may have existed for a somewhat longer time. Jean Feuilley in 1705 mentioned that all native pigeons were extinct; it seems likely that introduced rats and cats, combined with excessive hunting, were the causes of the birds' extinction.

It evolved from Okanagan College (1965 to c. 1990), and the college's predecessor, the B.C. Vocational School (1963‚Äì1965). On 30 June 2005, OUC was split to create two new institutions, a new Okanagan College and UBC Okanagan. History In the 1980s, a Kelowna community group began a concerted effort, lobbying the British Columbia provincial government for better access to undergraduate university programs. Their campaign, \\"Getting There By Degrees\\", facilitated a change in Okanagan College's mandate, allowing the college to offer undergraduate degree programs to students in the Okanagan region. The college informally adopted the new name, Okanagan University College (OUC) in 1992. This name was adopted as the institution's legal name in 1995. Although the degree programs were mostly based on a new, North Kelowna campus which opened its doors to students in January 1993, the first degrees were awarded earlier, on 11 June 1991. Initially, students completed their degrees through collaborations with the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the University of Victoria, and the degrees were granted in the names of the university collaborators (e.g., \\"a Bachelor of Science from University of British Columbia, at Okanagan University College\\"). In 1998 OUC began granting degrees under its own authority. New faculty in the degree programs continued to lobby for changes in the institution's mandate, eventually helping to establish a new community group, \\"University 2000\\", with the slogan \\"OU? Oh yes! Full University Status for OUC\\". The goals of this group were to further expand the university college's postsecondary role, principally by adding graduate studies and research to OUC's mandate. The growth of the degree programs, the expansion of the North Kelowna Campus, and the activities of this lobby created some tensions between degree-program faculty, largely based at North Kelowna, and other parts of the institution. Some faculty favoured splitting the institution into a new university and a new community college. Although OUC's initial progress had been hampered by not having a research mandate, and delays in obtaining recognition from the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), OUC faculty had rapidly developed a solid reputation in the research community. External research funding, for example, at OUC grew from less than $1 million in 2002‚Äì2003 to $6.8 million in 2004‚Äì2005. OUC research funding greatly outstripped that of the other university colleges in British Columbia (Cariboo University College (now Thompson Rivers University), Malaspina University College (now Vancouver Island University), Kwantlen University College (now Kwantlen Polytechnic University, and University College of the Fraser Valley) (now University of the Fraser Valley). At the same time, OUC maintained an enviable reputation for the quality of its educational programs, and the commitment of its faculty to teaching. In May 2001 OUC and the Okanagan University College Faculty Association signed a university-style contract for faculty, instituting rank, tenure and promotion. The contract was concluded in the window of opportunity made possible by the ouster of the NDP provincial government. The new Liberal government fired the OUC board, but the new Liberal-appointed board reviewed the contract, determined that it was sound, and implemented the agreement. In December 2002 the British Columbia Progress Board submitted a report to the provincial government, recognising the need to further expand postsecondary opportunities in the valley. The progress board, chaired by UBC president Martha Piper, recommended that the province consider extending \\"the mandate of an existing provincial University to Kelowna...\\", and \\"the mandate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology to Kelowna and Prince George...\\"(executive summary of the board report in pdf) The provincial government responded by quietly beginning negotiations with the University of British Columbia. It was noted by many people, including opposition MLAs in the BC Legislature, that UBC President Martha Piper was in a clear conflict of interest in using her position on the Progress Board to position her own University to take over OUC's university programs. On 17 March 2004, the province and the University of British Columbia held a closed joint press conference at the Grand Hotel in downtown Kelowna, announcing that OUC would be dissolved, with OUC's North Kelowna Campus being transferred to University of British Columbia. OUC's degree programs were largely adopted, with minor modification, by University of British Columbia. UBC also introduced new degree programs that had not existed at OUC. The other components of Okanagan University College (including the entire business administration program, degree included) were allocated to the new college. The agreement allowed for a 15-month transition, before the changes would be formally adopted. Although rumours circulated widely, OUC had not been formally informed in any way of the change in advance. The press conference was not open to the OUC community, including OUC's president. Never before had an AUCC member university secretly negotiated with a government to take over a sister AUCC member institution. The OUC board was dismissed, being replaced by a public administrator (initially Jim Soles, Assistant Deputy Minister, Ministry of Advanced Education; and later Dr. Peter Meekison). OUC President Dr. Katy Bindon was dismissed, being replaced by OUC vice-president academic, Dr. Peter Ricketts, for the final year of OUC's existence. On 1 July 2005 the North Kelowna campus became UBC Okanagan, a new campus of the University of British Columbia. Although OUC's applied degrees in Business and Computer Information Systems remained with the College, the new college resurrected the name Okanagan College ‚Äì this name reflecting the loss of most of OUC's degree programs.

Besides some of the removed content everything else such as the voice acting, narration, and intro movie were still there.

Guinness World Records lists the biggest as 136 kg (300 lb) with an arm span of 9.8 m (32 ft). A UN catalog of octopuses sizes E. dofleini at 180 kg (396 lb) with an arm length of .  Ecology  = Diet = E. dofleini preys upon shrimp, crabs, scallop, abalone, cockles, snails, clams, lobsters, fish, and other octopuses. Food is procured with its suckers and then bitten using its tough beak of chitin. It has also been observed to catch spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) up to in length while in captivity. Additionally, consumed carcasses of this same shark species have been found in giant Pacific octopus middens in the wild, providing strong evidence of these octopuses preying on small sharks in their natural habitat.Walla Walla University Marine Invertebrates Key: Giant Pacific Octopus In May 2012, amateur photographer Ginger Morneau was widely reported to have photographed a wild giant Pacific octopus attacking and drowning a seagull, demonstrating that this species is not above eating any available source of food within its size range, even birds. = Predators = Scavengers and other organisms often attempt to eat octopus eggs, even when the female is present to protect them. Giant Pacific octopus paralarvae are preyed upon by many other zooplankton and filter feeders. Marine mammals, such as harbor seals, sea otters, and sperm whales depend upon the giant Pacific octopus as a source of food. Pacific sleeper sharks are also confirmed predators of this species. In addition, the octopus (along with cuttlefish and squid) are major sources of protein for human consumption. About 3.3 million tons are commercially fished, worth $6 billion annually. Over thousands of years, humans have caught them using lures, spears, pot traps, nets, and bare hands. The octopus is parasitized by Dicyemodeca anthinocephalum, which lives in their renal appendages. Takoyaki stall in Nishi-Magome, Tokyo Lifespan and reproduction Enteroctopus dofleini spawning The giant Pacific octopus is considered to be long-lived compared to other species, with lifespans typically 3‚Äì5 years in the wild. Many other octopuses go through a lifespan in one year, from egg to end of life. To make up for its relatively short lifespan, the octopus is extremely prolific. It can lay between 120,000 and 400,000 eggs which are intensively cared for by the females. The female stops eating during this care and her life ends soon after the eggs hatch. Eggs are coated in chorion, and the female attaches the eggs to a hard surface. She continuously blows water over the eggs, and grooms them to remove algae and other growths. Eggs hatch in about 6 months. Hatchlings are about the size of a grain of rice, and very few survive to adulthood. Their growth rate is incredibly high. Starting from 0.03 g and growing to at adulthood, which is an increase of around 0.9% of growth a day. Because they are cool-blooded, they are able to convert most of consumed energy into body mass, respiration, activity, and reproduction. Hectocotylus arm of an octopod During reproduction, the male octopus deposits a spermatophore (or sperm packet) more than 1 m long using his hectocotylus (specialized arm) in the female's mantle. Large spermatophores are characteristic of octopuses in this genus. The female stores the spermatophore in her spermatheca until she is ready to fertilize her eggs. One female at the Seattle Aquarium was observed to hold onto the spermatophore for seven months before laying fertilized eggs. Giant Pacific octopuses are semelparous; they breed once before death. After reproduction, they enter a stage called senescence, which involves obvious changes in behavior and appearance, including a reduced appetite, retraction of skin around the eyes giving them a more pronounced appearance, increased activity in uncoordinated patterns, and white lesions all over the body. While the duration of this stage is variable, it typically lasts about one to two months. Death is typically attributed to starvation, as the females stop hunting and instead protect their eggs; males often spend more time in the open, making them more likely to be preyed upon.  Intelligence  Giant Pacific octopus Octopuses are ranked as the most intelligent invertebrates. Giant Pacific Octopuses are commonly kept on display at aquariums due to their size and interesting physiology, and have demonstrated the ability to recognize humans that they frequently come in contact with. These responses include jetting water, changing body texture, and other behaviors that are consistently demonstrated to specific individuals. They have the ability to solve simple puzzles, open childproof bottles and use tools. The octopus brain has folded lobes (a distinct characteristic of complexity), visual and tactile memory centers. They have about 300 million neurons. They have been known to open tank valves, disassemble expensive equipment, and generally wreak havoc in labs and aquaria. Some researchers even claim that they are capable of motor play and having personalities. Conservation and climate change Giant Pacific octopuses are not currently under the protection of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora or evaluated in the IUCN Red List. The giant Pacific octopus has not been assessed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, although other octopus species are listed. Combined with lack of assessment and mislabeling, tracking the species' abundance is nearly impossible. Scientists have relied on catch numbers to estimate stock abundance, but the animals are solitary and difficult to find. DNA techniques have assisted in genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the species' evolutionary past. After DNA analysis, the giant Pacific octopus may actually be three subspecies (one in Japan, another in Alaska, and a third in Puget Sound). In Puget Sound, the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission adopted rules for protecting the harvest of giant Pacific octopuses at seven sites, after a legal harvest caused a public outcry. Populations in Puget Sound are not considered threatened. Regardless of these data gaps in abundance estimates, future climate change scenarios may affect these organisms in different ways. Climate change is complex, with predicted biotic and abiotic changes to multiple processes including oxygen limitation, reproduction ocean acidification, toxins, effects on other trophic levels, and RNA editing. =Oxygen limitation= Octopuses have been found to migrate for a variety of reasons. Using tag and recapture methods, scientists found they move from den to den in response to decreased food availability, change in water quality, increase in predation, or increased density (or decreased available habitat/den space) Because their blue blood is copper-based (hemocyanin) and not an efficient oxygen carrier, octopuses favor and move toward cooler oxygen-rich water. This dependency limits octopus habitat, typically in temperate waters 8‚Äì12 ¬∞C (46‚Äì54 ¬∞F). If sea water temperatures continue to rise, these organisms may be forced to move to deeper, cooler water. Each fall in Washington's Hood Canal, a habitat for many octopuses, phytoplankton and macroalgae die and create a dead zone. As these micro- organisms decompose, oxygen is used up in the process and has been measured to be as low as 2 parts per million (ppm). This is a state of hypoxia. Normal levels are measured at 7‚Äì9 ppm. Fish and octopuses move from the deep towards the shallow water for more oxygen. Females do not leave, and die with their eggs at nesting sites. Warming seawater temperatures promote phytoplankton growth, and annual dead zones have been found to be increasing in size. To avoid these dead zones, octopuses must move to shallower waters which may be warmer in temperature and less oxygen-rich, trapping the organism between two low-oxygen zones. =Reproduction= Increased seawater temperatures also increase metabolic processes. The warmer the water, the faster octopus eggs develop and hatch. After hatching, the paralarvae swim up to the surface to join other plankton, where they are often preyed upon by birds, fish, and other plankton feeders. Quicker hatching time may also affect critical timing with food availability. One study found that higher water temperatures accelerated all aspects of reproduction and even shortened lifespan by up to 20%. Other studies concur that warming climate scenarios result in higher embryo and paralarvae mortalites. =Ocean acidification= The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, industrialization, and other land-use changes cause increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The ocean absorbs an estimated 30% of emitted anthropogenic CO2. As the ocean absorbs CO2, it becomes more acidic and lowers in pH. Ocean acidification lowers available carbonate ions, which is a building block for calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calcifying organisms use calcium carbonate to produce shells, skeletons, and tests. The prey base that octopuses prefer (crab, clams, scallops, mussels, etc.) are negatively impacted by ocean acidification, and may decrease in abundance. Shifts in available prey may force a change upon octopus diets to other nonshelled organisms. Because octopuses have hemocyanin as copper-based blood, a small change in pH can reduce oxygen-carrying capacity. A pH change from 8.0 to 7.7 or 7.5 will have life-or-death effects on cephalopods. =Toxins= Dr. Roland Anderson, an octopus specialist, found high concentrations of heavy metals and PCBs in tissues and digestive glands. He suggests that these high concentrations were obtained from their preferred prey, red rock crab (Cancer productus). These crabs bury themselves in contaminated sediments and eat prey that live nearby. What effects these toxins have on octopuses are unknown, but other exposed animals have been known to show liver damage, changes in immune systems, and death. =Effects on other trophic levels= Potential changes in octopus populations will affect upper and lower trophic levels. Lower trophic levels include all prey items, and may fluctuate inversely with octopus abundance. Higher trophic levels include all predators of octopuses, and may fluctuate inversely with octopus abundance, although many may prey upon a variety of organisms. Protection of other threatened species may affect octopus populations (the sea otter, for example), as they may rely on octopuses for food. Some research suggests that fishing other species have aided octopus populations, by taking out predators and competitors. =RNA editing= Some octopuses exhibit the ability to alter speeds of sodium and potassium ion movement across cell membranes, allowing them to live in very cold water. Joshua Rosenthal, at the University of Puerto Rico's Institute of Neurobiology has found that they have altered protein synthesis, and can speed up potassium channels in cold water, to keep up with sodium ion exchange. He is now looking into whether individuals can alter their protein synthesis in response to changing temperatures, or if it is done over long-term adaptations. If changes are possible by the individual, octopuses may be able to adapt quickly to changing climate scenarios.

He is currently the Academy goalkeeping coach of Premier League side Sheffield United. Career =Hull City= He joined Hull City on 23 July 2004 from Burton Albion for a fee of ¬£20,000, which could have risen to ¬£60,000 depending on appearances. He was a regular starter at Burton, having made 78 league appearances for them in his three seasons at the club, but at Hull he spent several seasons mainly being used as cover for first-choice goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, making few first-team appearances and spending time on loan at Stockport County and Wycombe Wanderers. Duke playing for Hull City in 2010 In 2007‚Äì08, Duke impressed sufficiently in a League Cup match against Crewe to retain his place in the Hull team for the subsequent league game and demote Myhill to the bench. He was also selected for the next two matches, but a thigh injury prevented him from finally getting a run in the team. On 5 January 2008 Duke underwent an operation to remove a testicular tumour. He returned to the squad on 29 March to take his place on the bench for a 3‚Äì0 victory against Watford. On 1 June 2008, Duke completed the \\"Keep Your Eye On The Ball\\" 5 km run in London's Victoria Park, in aid of the Everyman Campaign cancer charity. In September 2008, Duke, manager Phil Brown, chairman Paul Duffen and other Hull City colleagues participated in Everyman's \\"Tacheback\\" campaign, growing moustaches to raise sponsorship money for the charity. In Hull City's debut Premier League season in 2008‚Äì09, Duke again started the season as Myhill's understudy. He impressed however when given his chance in League Cup and FA Cup matches, keeping two clean sheets against Newcastle, which resulted in him being called up to make his Premier League debut on 28 January 2009 against West Ham. Although Hull City lost the game 2‚Äì0, Duke saved a penalty and was City's man-of-the-match. He retained his place in the side for the next nine league games. =Derby County= On 4 March 2011, Derby County confirmed that they have signed Duke on loan from Hull City until the end of the season. The loan period was cut short when he was recalled by Hull City following an injury to reserve keeper Mark Oxley. On 10 May 2011, following the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, it was confirmed by the club that Duke had been released from Hull City along with three other players, ending seven years of service to the club. He began training with Derby County at the start of July 2011. =Bradford City= Bradford City's victory in the 2013 Football League Two play-off Final Duke went on trial at boyhood favourites Sheffield United and played 45 minutes of their 2011 pre- season match with Worksop Town FC as reported by the Sheffield Star. On 31 August 2011, Duke joined Bradford City on a two-year contract. He made his debut on 3 September 2011 in a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Morecambe. On 20 February 2012 Duke went on loan to Northampton Town for the remainder of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 28 March, Duke was recalled by Bradford after their first choice goalkeeper was sent off in a mass brawl the previous day in a match between Bradford and Crawley. He re-gained his place as first choice goalkeeper at the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season, and kept two clean sheets in his first three games.\\"Notts County 0‚Äì1 Bradford\\" 11 August 2012.

He is best known as a pitcher that could throw left-handed and right-handed, and for having one of the highest career win totals of pitchers not in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Career Born in County Cork, Ireland, Mullane emigrated to the United States in 1864. He made his major league debut with the Detroit Wolverines on August 27, , picking up his first career win 9‚Äì1 over the Chicago White Stockings. Mullane suffered an injury to his right arm and managed to teach himself to throw left-handed. He resumed throwing right-handed once the injury healed, and he even alternated throwing right-handed and left-handed in the same game, which was easy for him since he did not wear a glove. Mullane faced the batter with both hands on the ball, and then use either one to throw a pitch. It was over 100 years before another ambidextrous pitcher, Greg A. Harris, using a specially made ambidextrous glove, got to switch-pitch in one game shortly before he retired with the Montreal Expos. Harris was the only pitcher to do so in the 20th century. He had spent most of his career prohibited by the Boston Red Sox from pitching left-handed. In , Mullane moved on to the American Association and joined the Louisville Eclipse, where he started 55 of the team's 80 games and compiled a record of 30‚Äì24 with a 1.88 earned run average, the first of five consecutive 30-win seasons. On September 11, he pitched a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Red Stockings. He recorded 35 victories with the St. Louis Browns. In , Mullane attempted to sign with the St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association, a new independent league, even though under the reserve clause the Browns still had rights to his services. Threatened with banishment for defying his contract, Mullane relented. The Browns then sold him to the expansion Toledo Blue Stockings, with whom he won a career-high 36 games. That season, Mullane was teamed up with catcher Moses Fleetwood Walker, one of the first black men to play in Major League Baseball. Mullane stated Walker \\"was the best catcher I ever worked with, but I disliked a Negro and whenever I had to pitch to him I used to pitch anything I wanted without looking at his signals.\\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1147947-moses-fleetwood-walker- the-forgotten-man-who-actually-integrated-baseball This helped contribute to Mullane's league leading 63 wild pitches that season.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/m/mullato01.shtml The Browns attempted to reclaim Mullane after the 1884 season when both the Union Association and the Blue Stockings folded, but before the Browns could re-sign him under the rules, Mullane managed to sign with Cincinnati. For this action, the American Association suspended him for the entire season. Coming in the midst of his string of consecutive 30-win seasons, this may have cost Mullane a 300-win career. Following the suspension, Mullane joined the Cincinnati Red Stockings for the season and remained there for the next seven and a half years, over which he won 163 games. At the plate, in he recorded career-highs with a .296 batting average, a slugging percentage of .418, and 24 stolen bases in 196 at- bats. The season brought several rules changes, most notably the moving of the pitcher's mound an additional five feet from home plate. Mullane began the season a mediocre 6‚Äì6, and was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on June 16. He staggered to an 18‚Äì25 record with the Orioles in a little more than one full season over 1893 and . Mullane set a dubious record on June 18, 1894, by allowing 16 runs in the first inning of a game against the Boston Beaneaters. A month later he was traded again, this time to the Cleveland Spiders, for whom he played only four games. Mullane retired after the 1894 season with a record of 284‚Äì220 and a 3.05 ERA over a 13-year career. He also worked five games as an umpire. His 284 wins tie him with Ferguson Jenkins for 27th on the all-time list; he is fourth among eligible pitchers not in the Hall of Fame, behind only Roger Clemens (354), Bobby Mathews (297) and Tommy John (288). Mullane still holds the record for the most wild pitches in major league history, with 343. Post-career After his baseball career, Mullane went on to join the Chicago Police Department, from which he retired in 1924. Mullane died at the age of 85 in Chicago, and is interred in grave 2, lot 48, block 5, section 58 at Holy Sepulchre Catholic Cemetery located in Worth, Illinois. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2010.

They are often found in the United States in gas stations, convenience stores, and other small stores, and were similarly common in Canada before the penny went out of circulation in 2013. Usage The small cup or tray near a cash register is designated as a place for people to place pennies they receive as change if they do not want these pennies. Then, customers who, for example, need one cent for a transaction can take one of the pennies to avoid needing one of their own or breaking a higher-denomination coin or bill. The tray can also be used by cashiers for the sake of efficiency: the cashier may take a penny (1 cent) from the tray and then give the customer, for example, one quarter (25 cents) instead of 24 cents (two dimes and four pennies, or six coins in all).

Beginning in 1870, Braham starred for several years in the intimate musical German Reed Entertainments in London. In 1878, she moved to North America, where she continued to perform in comic opera. After returning to England, she was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, creating five of the principal soprano roles in the hit series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the title role in Patience (1881), Phyllis in Iolanthe (1882), the title role in Princess Ida (1884), Yum-Yum in The Mikado (1885), and Rose Maybud in Ruddigore (1887). She also played Aline in the first revival of The Sorcerer (1884‚Äì85). After leaving the D'Oyly Carte company, Braham continued to perform in England and widely on tour, starring in comic opera and grand opera in Australia, South America and South Africa. By the mid-1890s, she returned to Britain, playing in musical comedy and light opera, briefly rejoining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. She then continued to perform until 1912 in Britain and America, including with Lillie Langtry in plays without music. Life and career Braham was born into a Jewish family in Bloomsbury, London. =Early career= Braham as Patience Braham's first professional stage appearance was at St. George's Hall, London, in 1870, in a revival of Gilbert and Clay's Ages Ago. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas German Reed, the producers, starred with Braham.Stone, David. \\"Leonora Braham\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Braham received encouraging notices. She continued performing for the German Reeds for several years, but moved to Montreal with her first husband, Frederick E. Lucy Barnes, in 1878. In April 1878, Braham had won the Llewelyn Thomas gold medal competition at the Royal Academy of Music.The Times, 16 April 1878. p. 10, col. F In 1879, she played the title role in Gilbert and Clay's Princess Toto in New York and then in Boston. The theatrical newspaper The Era wrote that she gave \\"a most excellent performance, both vocally and histrionically. She has a sweet, light soprano, finely cultivated, and executed very effectively\\".\\"The Drama in America\\" . The Era, 11 January 1880, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 8 July 2010 In 1880 she was engaged in Alfred Cellier's The Sultan of Mocha, playing the role of Dolly, in New York. Her husband committed suicide in 1880 in North America. =Principal D'Oyly Carte soprano= When she returned to England, Braham briefly rejoined the German Reeds and was also performing in concerts.The Times, 12 February 1881, p. 4, col. D She was soon chosen to create the title role in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience at the Opera Comique with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1881, in which she again received excellent notices. She remained the company's principal soprano until 1887, creating the roles of Phyllis in Iolanthe (1882) and Princess Ida in Princess Ida (1884). She was initially cast to sing the role of Lady Psyche in the latter opera, but was promoted during the rehearsal period, when the original choice for the part, American Lillian Russell, had a disagreement with W. S. Gilbert and was dismissed. Braham, generally regarded as a light lyric soprano, nevertheless received good notices in the demanding role.Profile of Braham, Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website Sybil Grey, Braham and Jessie Bond in The Mikado She played the leading role of Aline in The Sorcerer in the 1884‚Äì85 revival. In 1885, she created the part of Yum-Yum in The Mikado, perhaps her best known role. The Era reported that \\"Miss Braham has in the part of Yum-Yum full opportunities for displaying those powers of finished acting and accomplished vocalism which have long since won for her the friendly admiration of all habitues of the Savoy.\\"\\"The Mikado at the Savoy\\", The Era, 12 September 1885, p. 9 She next created the part of Rose Maybud in Ruddigore (1887). Braham's struggles with alcoholism are portrayed in the 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, and during the run of The Mikado she was threatened with dismissal for this reason. During the summer of 1886, she secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company, and Carte soon had another reason to dismiss the actress. In early 1887, shortly into the run of Ruddigore, Braham finally informed Carte that she was pregnant with her second child, a daughter, born on 6 May.The Times, 10 May 1887, p. 1, col. A This was not acceptable, particularly as the chorus sings to her prim and proper character in Ruddigore, Rose Maybud, \\"Rose, all glowing with virgin blushes, say ‚Äì Is anybody going to marry you today?\\" She shortly left the Savoy, and Geraldine Ulmar was hastily called back from America to assume the role. Braham created more of the Gilbert and Sullivan heroines than any other soprano, and she was the only English soprano to create more than one such role.Ainger, p. 445 =Peripatetic performer= Braham, her husband and children travelled to Australia later in 1887, appearing there in a number of operas including Princess Ida, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Mikado, Patience, and Iolanthe with J. C. Williamson's opera company (along with other ex-D'Oyly Carte players such as Alice Barnett) and in Alfred Cellier's Dorothy, in the title role. The Argus of Melbourne wrote, of her first Australian performance, that she was \\"Petite in form, animated and graceful in bearing, displaying colloquial tones of sonorous quality and polite inflexion, and having a singing voice both sweet and full, and of high soprano range. Miss Braham got through an arduous first appearance with complete success.\\" She performed again in England from 1888 to 1890, in London and in the provinces, in works other than Gilbert and Sullivan including a substantial run in Gretna Green at the Comedy Theatre (1889‚Äì90), together with her old Savoy colleague Richard Temple.The Times, 5 December 1889, p. 8, col. C In 1890, and then again in 1891‚Äì92, Braham and her family (including two children under the age of four), together with other D'Oyly Carte regulars, including R. Scott Fishe, toured South America with the Edwin Cleary Opera Company, entertaining audiences in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Valparaiso, Lima, Rio de Janeiro and other cities. Braham played Yum-Yum in The Mikado, Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance, Aline in The Sorcerer, the title roles in Patience, Dorothy, Erminie and Pepita, and in Billie Taylor.Lamb, p. 30 Braham received generally good notices.

It was sold to Mayman Brothers in 1948 and Doug and Barry Smith in 1966 trading as Woronora Bus Company. Following the opening of the Alfords Point Bridge in September 1973 the service was extended to Padstow station. The operation was renamed Menai Bus Service.History of Our Bus Services Veolia Transport In August 1988, Menai Bus Service was purchased by Ron Deane who at the time operated Deanes Coaches on the North Shore.

Soon after, Veolia undertook a re-organisation and simplification of its route services across Region 13 in September 2006 and Region 10 in November 2007. However, many of the altered Region 10 bus routes were later restored to their original state due to a severe decline in passenger numbers and high levels of passenger complaints. The idea to make bus services \\"straighter\\" did not have a welcome reception with passengers who preferred convenience as opposed to speed for the sake of it on shorter routes. In February 2007, Veolia bought out its Region 13 partner Transit First which included the transfer of 86 buses, 15 routes and the lease on the current Bankstown Airport depot. This purchase also saw Veolia move their head office from Taren Point to Bankstown Airport. In January 2009, Region 11 operator Crowthers was purchased followed in October 2011 by fellow Region 11 operator Caringbah Bus Service. In March 2011, Veolia Transport worldwide merged with French-German company Transdev, to form Veolia Transdev. As a result, in July 2013, Veolia Transport NSW was renamed Transdev NSW. Later that year, fellow Transdev Australasia subsidiary Transdev Shorelink, was also absorbed into the Transdev NSW business. Rebranding of all Transdev NSW buses to the new Transdev logo took place in mid 2014. A new website for all Transdev NSW public bus operations was opened on 8 September 2014. Operations Transdev bus depot in Taren Point Transdev NSW operates the Region 10, 12 and 13 commuter bus services under contract to Transport for NSW.Region 10 Transport NSWRegion 12 Transport NSWRegion 13 Transport NSW Regions 10 services were operated by the company (then Connex) since the early 2000s. Region 11 and 13 services became fully operated by the company after the acquisition of other bus companies such as Transit First in the late 2000s and early 2010s. As a result, the smaller Region 11 was merged into the larger neighbouring Region 10. Transdev NSW also took responsibility for Transdev Shorelink routes in Region 12 in 2014, resulting in Transdev NSW operating in both northern and southern Sydney. In November 2012, Transdev Shorelink retained the contract to operate Region 12,Cut costs or bus contracts will go to private sector, minister tells drivers Sydney Morning Herald 7 November 2012 and this contract was passed on to Transdev NSW in 2014. Also in January 2013, Veolia were granted seven year extensions to their Region 10 and 13 contracts. Transdev NSW operates bus routes from depots at Bankstown Airport, Kingsgrove, Menai, Mount Kuring-gai, Revesby, South Granville and Taren Point. Transdev operates three of Sydney's Metrobus routes: M90 between Liverpool and Burwood, M91 between Hurstville and Parramatta and M92 between Sutherland and Parramatta. Transdev also operates one bus route to the Sydney CBD: 594 from North Turramurra. Transdev jointly operated the temporary North West Night Bus (NW1 & NW2) with Hillsbus from May 2019 until November. The bus service stopped at stations along the Metro North West Line on Sunday to Wednesday nights. Transdev also used to operate the Station Link services (SLx series) between September 2018 and May 2019, while the Epping to Chatswood rail link was closed for upgrading and conversion to Sydney Metro Northwest. The Station Link stopped at Epping, Chatswood,Macquarie Park, Eastwood, Macquarie University, Beecroft and St Leonards stations. Like the North West Night Bus, it was jointly operated with Hillsbus. Fleet As of September 2020, the fleet consists of 472 buses.Transdev NSW, Australian Bus Fleet Lists Most of the buses have white liveries. The fronts of the older white buses were originally yellow and were repainted when the company was rebranded as Veolia in April 2006. Buses dedicated to the Metrobus operation (67 as of September 2020) have a red livery applied, there was also dedicated free shuttle bus liveries though this was later removed. Since 2010 the Transport for NSW white and blue livery progressively began to be applied to the bus fleet.

Several drivers, including Marshall Teague and Herb Thomas, drove Hudson Hornets that were nicknamed the \\"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\\". Factory racing support Hudson Motor Car Company was an early proponent of auto racing as an integral component of the automaker's marketing strategy. The company began directly backing their racing teams and \\"providing the team cars with everything they needed to make their cars faster.\\" Drivers that were part of the Hudson team included Marshall Teague, Herb Thomas, Dick Rathmann, Tim Flock, Fonty Flock, Jack McGrath, Frank \\"Rebel\\" Frank Mundy, and Lou Figaro. Together they accounted for 13 wins in 1951, 49 in 1952, and 46 in 1953. With the lowest center of mass among standard-sided cars at the time, the Hudson was praised for its great handling and roadworthiness so that stock car racers embraced these cars and \\"christened them with the 'Fabulous' prefix that followed this line through its days of track dominance.\\" The combination of the car's light weight due to the advanced unibody construction that Hudson called 'step down' design, allowed Hudson drivers to win various stock car racing events from 1951 through 1954. Drivers \\"proved it could out-handle and out-accelerate much of its supposedly more powerful V-8 competition.\\" The company used the \\"Fabulous Hudson Hornet, national stock car champion\\" description in its advertising.  Marshall Teague  Marshall Teague approached the Hudson Motor Car Company by traveling to Michigan and visiting their plant without an appointment. By the end of the visit Hudson executives assured Teague of corporate support and cars and the relationship was formalized shortly thereafter. Teague was also instrumental in helping Hudson tune the inline six-cylinder-powered Hudson Hornet to its maximum stock capability. His first time driving the Hornet in the February 1951 Daytona Beach and Road Course resulted in a first-place finish. Teague nicknamed his Hudson Hornet the \\"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\\" and had that name painted on the sides of the car. Teague went on to win five of the fifteen NASCAR Grand National races in 1951. Teague and his crew chief Smokey Yunick won 27 of 34 events in major stock car events, including seven NASCAR events. Teague left NASCAR during the 1952 season in a dispute with NASCAR's owner Bill France, Sr. Teague was awarded the 1951 AAA Stock Car Driver of the Year, and the 1952 and 1954 AAA National Stock Car Champion while driving in the Fabulous Hudson Hornet. The original Fabulous Hudson Hornet can be found today, fully restored, at the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This Hornet is also occasionally used in classic car racing.  Herb Thomas  Herb Thomas' #92 Fabulous Hudson Hornet Herb Thomas began the 1951 NASCAR Grand National season with moderate success in a Plymouth car, plus one win in an Oldsmobile. He switched mid season to his Fabulous Hudson Hornet, and won the 1951 championship. Thomas dominated the entire 1953 NASCAR Grand National season. He won a series best 12 races en route to becoming the first two-time series champion. A 1952 model was purchased by Thomas from a Hudson dealer sometime in late July or August 1952, and he campaigned it during next season and a half, ultimately capturing fifteen wins, as well as the 1953 championship with it. When Thomas purchased a replacement car to race in the 1954 season, his 1952 model was sold as a used car and subsequently driven in the southern U.S. ending up in eastern Kentucky by the mid-1970s. After being put in storage, changing owners, and verifying the serial numbers that it was the original number 92 raced by Thomas, the car was restored and shown at the 1998 EyesOn Design show. This car was nominated for the National Historic Vehicle Register, which is limited to cars with \\"important American historic events, association with important American historic figures, its design or construction value, and its informational value\\" and shown at 2014 \\"Cars At The Capital\\" - the first ever automotive heritage celebration held on the National Mall.  Tim Flock  Tim Flock's Fabulous Hudson Hornet Julius Timothy Flock (May 11, 1924 ‚Äì March 31, 1998), an early NASCAR two time series champion, won the 1952 Grand National Champion cup as driver of one of the three Fabulous Hudson Hornets. His second championship cup, in 1955, was won using a Chrysler automobile. He was forced out of NASCAR after supporting a 1961 unionisation attempt but continued to race under other sanctioning bodies.  Legacy  Despite Hudson's racing success, the marketplace competition and fierce rivalry between Chevrolet and Ford was too much to save the small scale independent automaker. Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in 1954 to become American Motors Corporation. The Hudson name was finally retired in 1957, as AMC transformed into Rambler. The Hornet name was used by AMC for their compact sedan from 1970 to 1977. When automakers began returning to racing venues as a form of advertising and industrial prowess, AMC was competitive in the drag racing scene with their AMX taking the SS/D class record for ten years, and successfully fielded the AMC Javelin in the Trans-Am Series winning the manufacturer trophies in 1970 and 1971. The AMC Matador was developed into a winner on the NASCAR circuits. Cars (2006) The 2006 animated film Cars tells the story of a hotshot race car, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) who finds himself stuck in the Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. The town's judge and doctor is Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman), a Hornet that turns out to be the real Fabulous Hudson Hornet himself. Doc Hudson in Cars closely resembles the \\"Fabulous Hudson Hornet.\\" He shares many of the same records as the real Hornet, although their fates differ. His number is 51, in reference to the year his model was created.

The Nankana massacre (or Saka Nankana) took place in Nankana Sahib gurdwara on 20 February 1921, at that time of British India, in modern-day Pakistan. More than 260 Sikhs were killed, the youngest of them being a little short of eight years, Sardar Darbara Singh, son of Sardar Kehar Singh, by the Mahant and his mercenaries.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/martyrs-of- nankana-sahib-massacre-remembered-in-pak/articleshow/57280793.cms The event forms an important part of Sikh history. In political significance, it comes next only to Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 1919. The saga constitutes the core of the Gurdwara Reform Movement started by the Sikhs in early twentieth century. Counter-response of the Sikhs The Shiromani Committee decided of its own to meet the Mahant on 3 March 1921 to advise him to hand over the charge to the committee. But the Committee got the information from its own intelligence that Mahant was planning to invite the Sikh leaders at Nanakana Sahib and have them killed from hired gundas. This greatly angered Kartar Singh Jhabber and others. A meeting of the Sikh leaders was called at Gurdwara Khara Sauda on 16 February 1921 to chalk out the future course of action. It was decided that Sangat would go in Jathas (squads) and take charge of the Gurdwara. Sikh leaders learnt that Mahant was going to Lahore on 20 February 1921. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar and Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali decided to take their jathas to Nanakana Sahib on 20 February. Peaceful Khalsa on the march The combined Jatha took a Hukamnama and started for the Gurdwara at about 10 PM on that night so as to reach there by early morning at Amrit vela (nectral hours). On the way 50 more Sikhs joined the Shaheedi Jatha and total number swelled to about 200. At Chanderkot Jhal, Jathedar Lachhman Singh decided to wait for Kartar Singh Jhabber and his Jatha. They waited for a while in vain and finally Jathedar Dharowali decided to cancel the plan for further march to Nankana Sahib. But at this very moment, Jathedar Tehal Singh came forward and addressed the Shaheedi Jatha not to vacillate even for a moment from forward march since \\"the prayers having already been said and the action plan having already been decided with Guru's word, it is now imperative for now to move forward\\". Advising further that \\"all the members shall keep cool even under extreme provocations\\". From here-onwards, Jathedar Tehal Singh took over the supreme command of the Shaheedi Jatha and resumed the march to Nankana. By almost at Amritvela, the Shaheedi Jatha reached the Railway-crossing near Nankana Sahib. Some of the Jatha members raced towards Darshani Deori to take possession of the Gurdawara, but at this very moment, Chaudhury Paul Singh Lyallpuri showed up with the latest decision of Shiromani Committee advising to postpone the action for taking possession of the Gurdwara. Having conveyed the information, Bhai Paul Singh grabbed Jathedar Lachhman Singh from his waist behind and persuaded him not to proceed further. Once again, Jathedar Tehal Singh took the initiative and shaking Chaudhury Paul Singh forcefully off from the person of Jathedar Lachhman Singh, he once more challenged the Shaheedi Jatha to get ready for the sublime action. He once again spoke: \\" Khalsa ji, the time is not to stop now, but to act. We have come here to achieve martyrdom under Guru's word. This is very un-Sikh-like to backout from one's commitment at the last moment\\" Saying this, Tehal Singh walked with the Jatha towards the Gurdwara. Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but Tehal Singh stuck to his ArdƒÅs.Sikh Gurdwaras in History and Role of Jhabbar, Karnail Singh See Link Massacre of Khalsa Enthused by the speech of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha followed him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the Prakash Asthan, others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the Jaikaras (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that the game was over but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form. The news spread and Sikhs from all parts of Punjab started their march towards Nankana Sahib. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabber reached next day with 2200 Singhs armed with shastras (arms). Fearing more trouble, Mr King, Commissioner Lahore, handed over the keys of Nankana Sahib to Shiromani Committee and arrested Mahant Narayan Das and his Pashtun mercenaries and charged them with murder, but only Das and some of the mercenaries were sentenced to death. Statistics on fatalities A total of 86 Sikhs officially died.Shamsher Gurbakash Singh, Shaheedi Jeewan, 1938, p 356; Sher Singh Sher, Glimpses of Sikhism and Sikhs, 1982, p 207 Mahatma Gandhi in Nankana Sahib Mahatma Gandhi visited Nankana Sahib on March 3, 1921. Addressing the gathering, Mahatma said: \\"I have come to share your anguish and grief. It is interesting indeed to note that the Sikhs in this drama remained peaceful and non-violent from the start to the end. This (role of the Sikhs) has greatly added to the glory and prestige of India \\"Sahni Ruchi Ram, Struggle for Reforms in Sikh Shrines (Ed Ganda Singh), p 81..... \\"All indications point to the fact that the cruel and barbaric action is the second edition of Jallianwala Bagh massacre; rather more evil and more invidious than even Jallianwala\\" .The Times, March 11, 1921 (A History of the Sikhs, Vol II, p 200, Khushwant Singh) Gandhi further spoke: \\"the action of these dimensions could not be perpetrated by Mahant alone. The government officers are also involved in this heinous crime. Where had the authorities gone when the Mahant was making preparations for murderous plans?\\" Legacy The supreme sacrifices made by these Sikhs Shaheeds have been gratefully acknowledged by the Sikhs. From that day onwards, the Sikhs remember these braves in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 20 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, Guru Granth Sahib's Swaroop with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.

Modern megalyrids are found primarily in the southern hemisphere, though fossils have only been found in the northern hemisphere. The most abundant and species-rich megalyrid fauna is in Australia. Another peak of diversity appears to be in the relict forests of Madagascar, but most of these species are still undescribed. Historically, there has been much confusion about the definition of this family. Species now placed in Megalyridae have in the past been classified into as many as six other families (Braconidae, Evaniidae, Ichneumonidae, and Stephanidae, as well as Dinapsidae and Maimetshidae, the latter two now considered ranks within the Megalyridae). The family has existed since the Jurassic, with the oldest known taxon being ‚Ä†Sinoryssus from the Callovian Haifanggou Formation of China. The best defining feature, unique to the family, is the mesothoracic spiracle has moved, and is actually located in the upper corner of the pronotum, though this is a fairly obscure feature to see. Perhaps the most useful visible character is that the base of the antenna fits into a wide, concave groove below the eye, though a few other wasp families exhibit this trait. Females of Megalyra have ovipositors ranging from five to eight times their body length, but this is not true of the other genera. The largest known megalyrid is the female of the Australian Megalyra shuckardi, with a body length of and ovipositor length of . The smallest known megalyrid is the Brazilian Cryptalyra plaumanni, with a body length of and ovipositor long. Megalyrid wasps are thought to be idiobiont endoparasitoids of concealed insect larvae. One Australian species, Megalyra troglodytes, attacks the larvae of Arpactophilus mimi, a mud-nesting crabronid wasp. Oviposition habits of Megalyridae are regarded as quite primitive, with field observations suggesting they simply poke their ovipositors into pre-existing cavities, holes, or cracks, rather than drilling into the substrate as in other Apocrita.

However, later political developments in Spain made it impossible for Galicia national football team to take part at official competitions. Hence, after Copa del Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias was discontinued all games were merely friendlies. The Galician national football team as such ceased all activity during the time of the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent dictatorship (1936‚Äì1975). =Revival in 2000s= The project was retaken in the early 1980s, although Galicia's first recent game only happened on 29 December 2005.

In December 2006, another game was contested against Ecuador, played in Riazor, A Coru√±a. The teams tied 1‚Äì1. Against Cameroon, on the next year, the result was the same, 1‚Äì1. Once again, in 2008, the Irmandi√±a played another friendly game, this time against Iran. The result was 3‚Äì2. =Amateur era= Changes in the composition of the Galician Government after the 2009 elections resulted in a lack of official support for the national team. However, the supporters' group Siareiros Galegos managed to organise a number of non-official international games involving Galician players from lower categories as a sign of protest, giving continuation to the project. These efforts were supported by a number of local governments, which would allow the use of their facilities. Galicia played teams representing Palestine, Western Sahara, Iraqi Kurdistan and Occitania in 2013. Siareiros Galegos announced at that time that it would be the last match until further notice due to the financial situation. On 26 December 2015, however, Siareiros Galegos did set up yet another game, where Galicia faced players representing Senegal. =Second revival= Galicia vs. Venezuela.

At the time of its dissolution and merger, the International represented 80,000 workers and was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. History =Oil Workers International (OWIU)= The union was first originally established as the International Association of Oil Field, Gas Well, and Refinery Workers of America in 1918 after a major workers' strike in the Texas oil fields in late 1917, which led to numerous mortalities.Maroney, James C. \\"The Texas-Louisiana Oil Field Strike of 1917.\\" In Essays in Southern Labor History. Gary M. Fink and Merl E. Reed, eds. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976. It affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) when they granted the occurrence of local unions of oil workers at a convention held in El Paso, TX and officially set up the international union for oil workers in 1918.O‚ÄôConnor, Harvey. History of Oil Workers Intl. Union (CIO). Oil Workers Intl. Union (CIO). 1950. Beginning with only 25 members, the newly established union underwent much success in the first few years of establishment. In just a few years they were already organizing and negotiating well thought out contacts that would affect thousands of oil workers in only three states California, Texas, and Oklahoma. Its membership grew to 30,000 as the oil industry grew rapidly in the United States in 1921, which was considered their first high peak but the Great Depression reduced its ranks to just 350 in the beginning of 1933. WIth the several local unions that had been established, only one local ‚Äì LB local 128- managed to not miss a single meeting.Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union AFL-CIO. Fact book. Publicity Department Ocaw-afl-cio. (October, 1956). The union began to increase in size and activity again once the NRA was passed in 1933. The NRA, under the New Deal, guaranteed the right of workers to organize. At the end of 1933, and even through the depression, several thousands of oil workers joined and rejoined the union and dispersed into several dozen locals. At this point being a part of the union became really important for the oil industry. In 1937, the union changed its name to the Oil Workers International Union (OWIU). The union was one of the first that affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization in early 1938, and AFL President William Green revoked the union's AFL charter. CIO helped the union grow significantly between the years of 1940-1946. Memberships grew due to large strategic groups that were brought into the union, but soon after growth began to slowly decrease after 1946. Due to the expanding in memberships and in the union itself, the OWIU extended its membership into Canada in 1948.O'Connor, Harvey. History of the Oil Workers International Union. Denver: Oil Workers International Union, 1950.Adkin, Laurie. The Politics of Sustainable Development: Citizens, Unions and the Corporations. Tonawanda, N.Y.: Black Rose Books, 1998. They expanded into Canada so that they could improve wages and working conditions. After 1948, due to wages and working conditions being outrageous, Canadian workers reaped the benefits of these changes from the union and soon after started to receive wages close behind those in the US. The impressive movement even far surpassed wages of other industries in Canada as well. =United Gas Coke and Chemical Workers of America (UGCCWA)= Similar to that of the OWIU, the UGCCWA began as the United Mine Workers of America. The main purpose of the UMA was to unite workers in industries related to coke and artificial gas production, which used coke as a fuel. Due to being unhappy with the service AFL was providing them, UMW eventually broke away from the AFL and they decided to create its own union separate from that of AFL called ‚ÄúDistrict 50‚Äù. District 50 became a branch of UMW and its main purpose was to cover ‚Äúgas, coke and chemical products‚Äù made from coal. Eventually, the president, John L Lewis, of UMW and of CIO resigned as president of the CIO and therefore removing UMW out of the CIO as well. After they were no longer part of AFL and CIO, Lewis strengthened District 50. He made it transform into a sort of all of the above branch of the Mine Workers, in such that all miscellaneous groups related to that of gas, coke, and chemicals were now a part of District 50 making gas, coke, and chemical workers simply a small division of District 50.Davidson, Ray. Challenging the Giants. Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union. 1988 Due to the impact that this action had on the workers of these companies, several of the division leaders from District 50 met with the CIO executive board in June 1942. They wanted to break away from District 20 and unite back into CIO so they wanted to discuss the chance of creating an international union for their industry alone. The UGCCWU had broken away from the United Mine Workers of America in September 1942, and won a charter from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). At the time they were finally granted charter, their union officially changed their name to United Gas Coke and Chemical Workers of America. The international under the CIO got off to a slow beginning and the first meeting only represented around 5,000 workers. However, in just a few months the union grew in size when numerous other groups left District 50 and joined the UGCCWA. In 1948, Lee Pressman of New York and Joseph Forer of Washington, DC, represented Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union along with Gerhard Eisler (public thought to be the top Soviet spy in America); Irving Potash, vice president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union; Ferdinand C. Smith, secretary of the National Maritime Union; and John Williamson, labor secretary of the CPUSA). On May 5, 1946, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Over the next several years, members slowly but steadily increased but finally hit their peak in 1950 when members quickly grew. Finally, when UGCCWA merged with OWIU almost 100,000 workers represented those in the gas, coke, and chemical industry. =Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union (OCAW)= Oil Workers International Union (OWIU) and the United Gas, Coke, and Chemical Workers of America (UGCCWA) merged on March 4, 1955 to form the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union (OCAW). When the AFL and CIO merged in 1955, so did the two oil workers' unions.Nelson, James.

New York: Exposition Press, 1955.Taft, Philip. \\"Independent Unions and the Merger.\\" Industrial and Labor Relations Review. 9:3 (April 1956). In 1956, after only one year of the merge, OCAW represented approximately 210,000 workers. During this time, it represented more workers than any other union in the oil and chemical field. The OCAW had one important objective and main focus of their union, the improvement of living conditions of those who work in oil, chemical and related industries. OCAW went about achieving this by collective bargaining and participating in community activities, political action, and educational work. Collective bargaining was focused on seeking better wages and better working conditions for the wage earned. The union, in a specific rule followed way, bargained with employers on how to improve these conditions. Also, by participating in community activities, political action, and educational work, the union intended on gaining experience first hand and developing ways to better government, schools, housing, recreational facilities, amongst other things that will help improve the community in entirety. In the 1970s, OCAW's Canadian locals broke off to form their own union. OCAW tried to absorb the United Rubber Workers several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but the talks collapsed due to internal union politics within the Rubber Workers and no merger ever occurred.Franklin, Stephen. Three Strikes: Labor's Heartland Losses and What They Mean for Working Americans. New York: Guilford Press, 2002.

August 26, 1998. OCAW gained a final victory as an independent union seven months after the merger, when the federal government acknowledged for the first time that nuclear weapons production during the Cold War likely caused the illness and even deaths of thousands of atomic mining, refining, and production workers. The government agreed to seek legislation to compensate workers and their survivors for their medical care and lost wages. The admission of complicity and legislative relief had long been sought by OCAW.Wald, Matthew L. \\"Work on Weapons Affected Health, Government Admits.\\" New York Times. July 15, 1999.

They have specific qualifications to provide leadership for initial-attack and extended- attack on wildland fires, and are trained and equipped to work autonomously in remote areas for extended periods of time with little or no logistical support. Hotshot crews are the most highly trained, skilled, and experienced type of handcrews. Hotshot crews are organized by agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, and state and county agencies; the National Interagency Fire Center coordinates hotshot crews on the federal level.  History  Prior to the 1930s, wildland firefighting crews were organized on an \\"as- needed\\" basis, hiring firefighters without any formal experience or training. The Civilian Conservation Corps, which operated from 1933 until 1942, was a work relief program that employed young men primarily in natural resource conservation projects. CCC members were also utilized for fire suppression operations, however, marking the first time that standing crews had been established for that purpose. At least one of the first crews carrying the name \\"hotshots\\" grew out of a former CCC camp in the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California. Conflicting sources report the first hotshot crews as starting in 1946 (Del Rosa and Los Padres Hotshots) or 1947 (Del Rosa and El Cariso Hotshots). In 1961, the Interregional Fire Suppression (IRFS) program was developed, establishing six 30-man crews across the Western U.S. These IRFS crews were stationed near airports for quick transportation to high-priority fires. Due to their effectiveness and value in fire management, the program expanded to 19 IRFS crews by 1974. In 1980, the term interagency hotshot crew was adopted by IRFS crews. In the mid-1990s, an Interagency Hotshot Crew Operations Guide was developed to standardize the training, responsibilities, and recognition process of hotshot crews. As of 2018, there were 113 hotshot crews.https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/people/hotshots/IHC_list.html#shasta National Forest Service listing  Operations  A hotshot crew consists of approximately 20‚Äì22 members, led by a minimum of one superintendent, one or two assistant superintendents, two or three squad leaders, and two senior firefighters.https://www.nifc.gov/policies/policies_documents/StandardsInteragencyHotshotCrewOps.pdf Hotshot crews are proficient in a range of fire suppression tactics. Like other handcrews, IHCs are primarily tasked with constructing, firing out, and holding handline, through the use of chainsaws, hand tools, ignition devices, and water delivery equipment. Hotshot crews can engage in all phases of wildfire response, from initial attack to mop-up. They are also trained in specialized operations, such as hot spotting, spot fire attack, tree felling, and structure protection. In order to effectively perform their duties, hotshot crews must maintain a high level of physical fitness. Aerobic fitness is correlated with the time it takes to reach a safety zone. The minimum recommended physical fitness standards for hotshots set by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group are: a 3-mile hike carrying a 60-pound pack in under 90 minutes, one and a half-mile run in 10:30 or less, 25 push-ups in 60 seconds, 45 sit-ups in 60 seconds and 2 pull-ups. While not fighting fires, hotshot crews typically work in their home units to meet resource goals such as thinning, prescribed fire operations, habitat improvement, and trail construction projects. Hotshot crews can also respond to other emergency incidents, including search and rescue and disaster response. In 2010, the Cherokee hotshot crew was assigned to clear trees downed by rare tornadoes in Prospect Park and Kissena Park in New York City, their first employment in an urban setting. Fatal accidents 1966 El Cariso Hotshots Crew 2 On November 1, 1966, the El Cariso hotshot crew were trapped by flames in the Loop Fire as they worked on a steep hillside in Pacoima Canyon in Angeles National Forest. An unanticipated upslope wind came up in the afternoon and a spot fire was fanned and funneled up the steep canyon. The crew were cutting handline downhill and most of the crew were unable to reach safety in the few seconds they had. Ten members of the crew died on the Loop Fire that day, and another two members died from burn injuries in the following days. Most of the 19 El Cariso crew members who survived were critically burned and remained hospitalized for some time. The Downhill Indirect Checklist, improved firefighting equipment and better fire behavior training resulted, in part, from lives lost on this fire.\\"Colorado Firecamp - Loop Fire Disaster, A Brief of the Analysis Group\\". https://www.coloradofirecamp.com/fire-origins/loop- fire-brief.htm. On July 6, 1994, nine members of a hotshot crew based in Prineville, Oregon, died after being overtaken by the fast-moving Storm King fire west of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Five other firefighters, three smokejumpers and two helitack firefighters, also died in the conflagration. On June 30, 2013, the Prescott Fire Department's hotshot crew perished in the Yarnell Hill Fire near Yarnell, Arizona. Nineteen of the twenty members of the crew were killed when their escape route was cut off by an approaching fire. All nineteen entrapped members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots deployed their fire shelters.https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B36DIycSgbzWSUtjNkl1Z2ROT0k/edit?usp=sharing The incident was made into a film, Only the Brave.

Although he had an extensive opera, concert and acting career, he is primarily remembered as the creator of five tenor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, including Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Lely studied singing in Italy in the early 1870s and beginning his career there. He returned to tour in concerts and made his British opera debut in 1879, at Her Majesty's Theatre, in what would become one of his signature roles, Don Jos√©, in Carmen. After touring in opera, he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1880, soon becoming their leading tenor. He began there in the role of Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance and went on to create five roles in the famous series of Savoy operas, including Nanki-Poo in The Mikado. He remained with the company until 1887. After this, Lely resumed a grand opera and concert career, appearing often with Adelina Patti, performing frequently at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and touring with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, among others. He appeared widely in a musical stage adaptation, and in 1911, a film adaptation, of Rob Roy. Lely continued to perform until 1925. He outlived nearly all of the singers with whom he had performed at the Savoy Theatre. Life and career =Early life and career= James Lyall was born in Glover Street, Arbroath, in the County of Angus, Scotland, the second son of Elizabeth, n√©e Dorward (1820‚Äì1896), and William Lyall (c. 1822‚Äì1898).Lamb, Andrew. \\"Lely, Durward (real name James Lyall) (1852‚Äì1944), singer and actor\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 14 November 2019, accessed 9 June 2020 His father was a stonemason and estate manager who became factor of Blackcraig Castle near Blairgowrie.The Times obituary, 2 March 1944, p. 7Moss, Simon. \\"Durward Lely Remembers Gilbert\\", W.

At the same time, he sang in church and with a local choral society and studied singing with Henry Nagel in Dundee. His father‚Äôs employer, Patrick Allan-Fraser, impressed by Lely's voice, sent him for training in Milan.Stone, David. \\"Durward Lely\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 17 August 2001, accessed 25 November 2009 He studied with Francesco Lamperti and others for five years, after which he adopted the middle name Durward and sang for three years in Italy under the stage name Durvardo Leli. In December 1874, he sang in concert in Rome, at the Teatro Argentina. He spent a season in Sardinia in 1876‚Äì77, where he sang tenor roles in such operas as La sonnambula, Il barbiere di Siviglia, L'elisir d'amore, La favorite, Don Pasquale, Maria di Rohan, Faust and Il trovatore. In 1878, back in England, Lely toured with J. H. Mapleson in concerts. He made his British operatic debut the following year, under the name Signor Leli, as Don Jos√© in Bizet's Carmen opposite Selina Dolaro, with the Carl Rosa Opera Company at Her Majesty's Theatre, London.\\"Music\\", The Daily News, 6 February 1879, p. 6 A review in The Athenaeum commented that he \\"can act as well as sing; his voice is of the tenorino class, light but agreeable\\".\\"Music\\", The Athenaeum, 8 February 1879, p. 194 While touring subsequently in Carmen with Emily Soldene's company, Lely became engaged to a Swansea native, Alice Frances Hurndall (1860‚Äì1936), whom he married early in 1881 in Liverpool. During two years on tour, including with Soldene and the Mapleson Opera Company, he played additional leading tenor roles, including Don Florio in Richard Gen√©e's The Naval Cadet and the Defendant in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury.\\"English Opera at the Gaiety\\", The Glasgow Herald, 20 April 1880, p. 4; and \\"Theatres\\", The Glasgow Herald, 24 August 1880, p. 6 In November 1880 Lely joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Opera Comique, London. He replaced George Power in the leading tenor role of Frederic in the original London production of The Pirates of Penzance. At Arthur Sullivan's suggestion, he adopted the stage name Durward Lely. Of his Frederic, The Times commented, \\"His acting and enunciation of the words, with and without music, leave much to be desired\\".The Times, 31 January 1881, p. 8. The Era was more impressed: \\"The advantage of having an experienced and competent operatic tenor to represent Frederic ‚Ä¶ is great, and Mr Durward Lely, having gained no little reputation in Italian opera, plays and sings in English with equal success. He acted with much spirit, and the graceful music allotted to the tenor was rendered very effectively\\".\\"Opera Comique\\", The Era, 29 January 1881, p. 7 =Principal tenor= Lely as Dauntless Lely became D'Oyly Carte's principal tenor, creating the leading tenor parts in five Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The first three of these were the Duke of Dunstable in Patience (1881; moving to the Savoy Theatre when the company transferred there), Earl Tolloller in Iolanthe (1882), and Cyril in Princess Ida (1884). He played Alexis in The Sorcerer and the Defendant in Trial by Jury when those operas were revived in 1884.Rollins and Witts, pp. 8‚Äì9 In 1885, he created the role of Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, playing the character until 1887.Rollins and Witts, p. 10 His role in that opera is dramatised in the 1999 Mike Leigh film Topsy-Turvy, where he is portrayed by Kevin McKidd.Topsy-Turvy at the IMDB database, accessed 25 November 2009 Of his Nanki-Poo, a review in The Era stated, \\"His voice is peculiar, but its peculiarity is far from unpleasant, and its timbre is of a quality that 'carries' far without much exertion on his part\\".\\"The Mikado\\", The Era, 12 September 1885 In 1887, Lely created the role of Richard Dauntless in the next Savoy opera, Ruddigore. In a 1926 article for The Gilbert & Sullivan Journal, Lely recalled how Dauntless's famous hornpipe dance became a part of the piece: :At the first music rehearsal, or rather the first time the music was played over to us by Sullivan at the piano we arrived at Dick Dauntless's \\"Parlez vous\\" song. After playing it over Sullivan said \\"That's your song, Lely.\\" Gilbert happened to be seated next to me, and I said quite innocently \\"It sounds as though a hornpipe should follow.\\" Gilbert grunted. Nothing more was said or thought - at least by me - about the matter. A few days later at rehearsal Gilbert, without any preamble, said \\"Lely, can you dance a hornpipe?\\" I was rather taken aback, as I had quite forgotten having spoken about one. So, trying to be funny I suppose, I said \\"Well, Mr. Gilbert, as the man said when asked if he could play the fiddle, I've never tried so I don't know.\\" Gilbert answered quite seriously \\"How soon can you know?\\" - and I said equally seriously - \\"To-morrow\\".Lely, Durward. The Gilbert & Sullivan Journal, July 1926, London After a few efforts, the ballet master confirmed: \\"Tell Mr. Gilbert you can\\". According to Lely, upon being so informed, \\"Gilbert said 'Right, I'll get Sullivan to write you one.'\\" The Times noted Lely's improved stage persona: \\"Mr Durward Lely was at first a very awkward actor, and yet, under Mr Gilbert's training, developed into the dashing tar in Ruddigore\\".The Times, 19 March 1888, p. 4 Late in 1887, when the run of Ruddigore ended, Lely left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. =Grand opera, concert work and later years= Lely in 1895 He then pursued a concert and operatic career. He appeared with Adelina Patti on numerous occasions, and she said he was her favourite tenor. He often sang at her home, Craig-y-Nos Castle, and he accompanied her on her farewell American tour in 1893‚Äì1894. He frequently sang Don Jos√© in Carmen, including appearing opposite Z√©lie de Lussan at Covent Garden in 1893, and also opposite Minnie Hauk.The Times, 16 January 1942, p. 5 Later, he sang the role at the Manhattan Opera House in New York. The Observer wrote of one of his performances in the role, \\"His acting was pathetic, impressive and natural; his elocution was polished, and he sang delightfully from beginning to end.\\"The Observer, 27 September 1891, p. 6 He had numerous operatic and concert engagements in London and elsewhere between 1890 and 1893. His operatic appearances included several at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, beginning with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in Lurline as Count Rudolph.The Times, 14 April 1890, p. 10 He also had roles in Mignon, The Bohemian Girl and Maritana. In an 1891 interview, Lely stated that he most enjoyed concert work. His performances on the concert stage included Messiah, The Creation, St Paul, Damnation of Faust, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's The Spectre‚Äôs Bride, The Golden Legend, and Frederic Cowen's St John‚Äôs Eve. He also acted widely in Scottish plays with songs, including as Francis Osbaldistone in a stage adaptation of Rob Roy and Henry Bertram in the stage version of Guy Mannering. Of his portrayal in an 1894 production of Rob Roy, a reviewer in The Dundee Courier wrote: \\"Certainly it is not possible to imagine ‚Ä¶ a finer Francis Osbaldistone than Mr. Lely. ‚Ä¶ He sang [his songs] as only he can sing them, and he infused an amount of expression and feeling into \\"Auld Langsyne\\" which we never heard equalled. The effect he produced in the chorus of this song was a veritable tour de force, and brought down the house, eliciting an undeniable encore.\\"Rob Roy at Her Majesty's Theatre\\", The Dundee Courier, 9 October 1894, p. 4 In 1893, he sang in Arthur Goring Thomas's opera The Golden Web at the Lyric Theatre. He also spent some time performing with his own opera company.Fraser, Stephen. \\"Durward Lely\\", OperaScotland.org, accessed 25 July 2014 Lely sometimes sang with his wife in amateur performances, for example as Lionel opposite her Nancy in Martha in Dundee in 1888. In 1892, he toured with his wife accompanying him at the piano in an entertainment called \\"Scottish Song and Story\\". They again toured with this entertainment in the US and Canada in 1895 and again in 1898, going on to Australia and New Zealand. In 1905, at the St. James's Theatre and then on tour, he starred in a stage adaptation of Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush with Henry Ainley and Lilian Braithwaite.The Observer, 3 December 1905, p. 5 Lely also appeared as Francis Osbaldistone in the 1911 film of Rob Roy. He became a close friend of fellow D'Oyly Carte principal Henry Lytton, even though Lytton's long tenure with the company took place mostly after Lely had left it.\\"Durward Lely\\", Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 25 November 2009 Lely continued to act and sing in Scottish plays with his own company until 1925. Lely and his wife had three sons and a daughter, Adelina, named for Patti. He retired to his estate, Glenardle, in Bridge of Cally, where he enjoyed fishing and shooting. After his wife died, he lived with their son, Durward junior, the manager of the King's Theatre in Glasgow. Lely outlived nearly all of the singers with whom he had performed at the Savoy Theatre, and newspapers referred to him as the last surviving Savoyard, but younger performers in the later Gilbert and Sullivan operas lived much longer (for example Decima Moore and Nancy McIntosh). Lely died in Hillhead, Glasgow, on 29 February 1944, at the age of 91, of heart failure. The date of his death is ironic for a Gilbert and Sullivan tenor, in that 29 February, leap day, is the birthday of the tenor character, Frederic, in The Pirates of Penzance, which becomes a key plot point. In Act II of the opera, Frederic promises to claim his bride on his 21st birthday, which will not take place until 1940.Atkinson, Brooks. \\"Leap Year Pirate Freed\\", The New York Times, 25 February 1940, p. 113 Lely thus died one \\"birthday\\" after that.Gilbert, W. S. \\"The Pirates of Penzance\\" at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 1879, accessed 25 November 2009 Autobiography In 2007, Simon Moss revealed a newly discovered pamphlet called Mr Durward Lely, The Eminent Tenor. The 20-page booklet describes Lely's career. It was first published in three instalments in March and April 1894 in The Blairgowrie Advertiser and then issued in booklet form. Although the pamphlet does not credit an author, it is patent that it is self-written. Lely praises Gilbert as a director.

He married Aimee Reynand Mazergue on June 4, 1898. Life =Early life and the call of medicine= Morris was the eldest of six children. His father was a lawyer, probate judge, and Governor of Connecticut. His mother Eugenia was an author. He attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven before studying biology at Cornell University in Ithaca from 1875-1879. As a child he developed an acute interest in nature and animals and continually observed the phenomena of the natural world. While still in high school in New Haven he planned to attend the biology program organised by Dr. Burt G. Wilder at Cornell.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt 1, p. 18\\" This was one of the first pre- medical curricula in the country. While debating whether to pursue a medical career an incident occurred that helped him to decide. A boy in the nearby town was bitten by a dog that was presumed to be rabid. He was dying of hydrophobia. So he went there to see the boy with Dr.P. C. Gilbert, who was in charge for this case. Thanks to his fine observation skills, he concluded that the boy was stricken with hysteria instead of rabies (which was the most accredited hypothesis). His diagnosis was proven to be correct. Using hypnosis he eventually cured the boy. This incredible experience produced a profound impression on him, and convinced him to continue the pursuit of his medical career.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon cpt 1, p. 20\\" =Pursuing studies and travelling= In 1879 he worked as assistant with Dr. F. J. and F. H. Whittemore. After that in 1880 he got into the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York and then graduated in 1882. Then he went up for examination for position on the Bellevue Hospital staff and he eventually got into the Fourth Surgical Division, so he spent a two-year internship there. At that time the Bellevue Hospital was the largest general hospital in the country. After his internship he studied in various surgical European clinics. While visiting Europe, he met Lister in London in 1884, and was one of the first to introduce Lister's teachings about surgical hygiene in the United States. Watching Lister at work he noticed how strongly his method was rejected by his British confreres. Then he wrote a little brochure ‚Ä≥How We Treat Wounds Today‚Ä≥ and published it in 1886. He also had been a delegate to the International Medical Congress in Copenhagen of 1887 and 1890 and he accomplished a visit to various European clinics. =Decision to specialize= In the end of the 1880s he had decided to make his work wholly surgical. Just around 1890 surgery started to be split up into its various specialties. Before that time, surgery was considered more like a general concept: in those days a surgeon would make everything concerning surgical operations. The post- graduate Robert was then fascinated by surgical experimental work. His general practice had included nearly every type of service, and on the whole, his knowledge and results were fine. But in order to be a good doctor, it is important to develop skills and craftsmanship that only the experiences of specialization could give. Genito-urinary work was extremely appealing to him, certainly because of his two skilled teachers Dr. Gouley and Dr. Fluhrer, but also the field of neurology and psychiatry was particularly fascinating to him too, because of its speculative sides. So he ended up taking surgery as a specialty. No one of the laity can realize how much time, pains, mistakes, imagination, mental distress, and money have gone into the making of an experienced surgeon.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 8, p. 116\\" The practice of surgery offered various cases that certainly increased Morris' skills, which will lead him to his greatest merits in different medical fields.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 8, p. 108\\" =After internship= After internship he settled at first in Albany, then moved to New York and began teaching at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School in 1889. He was given a position as instructor in surgery. This led step by step to a full professorship. He became a professor of surgery in 1898, a position he held until 1917. In the beginning teaching made him uncomfortable because of his radical attitude on some subjects. His post-graduate teaching lasted for nearly thirty years until the time of retirement. He was asked to teach surgery at Ann Arbor and at the University of Virginia, but he refused. His chief purpose in teaching was to stimulate his students to think.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt 10, p. 144\\" Morris was a member of most of the national societies. He became a member of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 1890 and its President in 1907; in 1900 he was elected as a member of the Southern Surgical Association and then a senior fellow later on, in 1923. He was also President of the American Therapeutic Association in 1916. In 1916 he accepted a position as a visiting surgeon to Broad Street Hospital in New York. He decided to continue professional work until he had completed fifty years of unbroken activity. Experimental work In the course of his experimental work he had elaborated new techniques and methods, which happened to be useful, and later on adopted by other surgeons. The drainage wick later called the B. M. drain (short for Bob Morris) was his own application of the principle of capillarity in the form of a small wick drain enclosed in a waterproof covering, applied in closing septic wounds. This is now best known as the cigarette drain.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 13, p. 203\\" He made some important experiments in cases of apoplexy, suggesting that if a drainage could be promptly established in some of these cases and in cases of sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, the following surgical operation would at time be useful. He also accomplished a number of experiments concerning the practical application of peroxide of hydrogen for the cleansing of wounds. Morris had invented a sort of artificial synovial fluid. Made out by a mixture of boroglyceride, glycerine and normal saline solution, it resulted to be antiseptic and hygroscopic, so that it had a tendency to draw serous fluids towards itself. The consequences of all of its specific characteristics were that when injected into a joint, this fluid resisted absorption longer that an oil could. And these properties were particularly useful in cases of painful joints (especially those one of knee and shoulder).\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 13, p. 205\\" Furthermore, he made some attempts at anastomosis of blood vessels and a number of experiments to determine if trypsin, pancreatic acid and pepsin would liquefy, in situ, sloughs and coagula that were difficult to remove from cavities. And he actually found out that pepsin acted best and was able to turned blood clot into semi-fluid form. Moreover, pepsin was useful since it would also remove dead bones (after being decalcified with hydrochloric acid), without showing any notable effects upon living bones.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 13, p. 208\\" Antisepsis enters In his book Fifty Years; A Surgeon\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, by Robert T. Morris\\" he gives a clear and complete description of hospital conditions at that time before the entrance of antisepsis in the world of surgery as a normal and necessary routine. So then at some point the Bellevue had to make some changes, due to the fact that Lister theories about the antisepsis had been accepted in the world of medicine. In the Surgical Division an extremely rapid change in method took place, so that the antiseptic surgery had changed the whole appearance of wards in the hospital. Morris was one of the main supporter of the new method enounced by Lister, and later on, of the new theories about asepsis, introduced by Dr. Ernst von Bergmann in 1892. Soon other discoveries in the field of Medicine made techniques to advance. In 1884 Morris was a member of the audience in Berlin when Karl Koller gave his first public demonstration of cocaine as a local anesthetic in eye work. Later on in the United States this experimentation will see his leader in the figure of Dr. William Stewart Halsted. So then anesthetics started to be used regularly during surgical operations.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 5, p. 74\\" Hospitals' growth One of the most astonishing changes remarkable in those days, was for sure the new attitude of the public toward hospitals. Since the day antiseptic surgery was adopted, hospitals became in a certain way recognized. Before that, people had fear to go to the hospital (a reasonable fear, since in certain cases surgical death rate was 79 per cent in one year). Clinics and hospitals grew all over the United States. Morris was one of the doctors that have promoted the construction of an hospital at Ithaca, the Memorial Hospital, which was finished in 1889 (but the formal opening of the Hospital was on January 1, 1892) and later on a College Infirmary.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 6, p. 90\\" The fourth era in surgery Robert Morris makes a distinction in his autobiographical book\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 11, p. 149\\" of his idea of the existence of four distinct eras in surgery, one by one characterized by a certain aspect. So he talks about a Heroic Era, then an Anatomic Era, a Pathologic Era and finally a Physiologic Era. The first one is about all that happened before doctors concentrated their studies upon Anatomy. So it lasts from the time of Hippocrates since the introduction of a rigorous study of the structure of human body. Since then operations were made with brutal rapidity, and there was no regard for antisepsis. The second era is signed by progress in knowledge and skills, but still surgeons would make unnecessary long incisions for their operations, ignoring the damage they could procure by using this method, making after all the body of the patient in front of a higher risk to get infected. Then with Lister and Pasteur discoveries there it came the third era, characterized by the consciousness that the microbe had to be considered bigger than the man (In the First and Second Eras of surgery man was bigger than the microbe; in the Third Era the microbe was bigger than the man\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 11, p. 153\\"). But still, using Morris' own words, incisions suitable for killing bears were being applied to weak patients and also surgeons made multiple incisions for purpose of drainage and these also caused shock.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 11, p.155\\" The last one era is based upon the revolutionary and recent idea that the patient, on the whole, is his own best antiseptic. He was a pro of this new point of view, which was contrasted for a long time, since it had come universally accepted. Inspired by an experiment made by Dawbarn (who was able to demonstrate that the pus originated in an abdominal infection could not be all removed in the course of the surgical operation by making a sort of try by pouring milk into the abdominal cavity of a cadaver and then trying in vane to get it completely out), he started to operate appendicitis with a new revolutionary method based upon the reduction of shock for the patient, making small incisions, and omitting pads (used for the purpose of protection) and the excessive drainage.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon\\" So he made a number of operations of the appendicitis using his own method, and then he was able to present in 1896 at the Academy of Medicine statistics of one hundred consecutive unselected appendicitis cases with a death rate of 2 per cent. His first formal presentation of these principles of the Fourth Era of Surgery (as he named it) was made before the Section of Surgery and Anatomy of A. M. A. and reported in the Transaction of the year. He also presented it at the International Medical Congress in Budapest in September 1909, and published his idea in Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetric for December. And he also published a book, Dawn of the Fourth Era in Surgery in 1910. Anyway, his results were not completely appreciated by other surgeons, for the appendicitis cases had at that time a high death rate. Some surgeons affirmed that those statistics were not to be taken seriously, since what they proved was impossible. He still improved his methods and skills and he furnished a contribution on Abdominal Surgery for Sajous' Cyclopedia. Merits Morris has a quite impressive list of merits he accomplished during his career as a surgeon. First of all while at the Bellevue Hospital he and Dr. Frase Fuller, a surgeon of another Division, had performed the very first cases of wiring of simple fracture of the patella that had been done in the United States, and probably in the world. In those days this type of operation would be considered non-sense and inappropriate, since the idea of opening an uninfected knee joint was mad, because it would have certainly lead to a disaster, like an infection. He developed a method for palpation of the appendix and published a report upon the subject.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 12, p. 197\\" He made up a method consisting in wound repairing through the agency of a moist blood clot, which became known and adopted in the world over as Schede method. Dr. Max Schede was indeed the one who decided to carry out this method in a number of different cases, after seeing Morris' demonstration, and he finally published a report upon this plan of procedure in the Deutzsche Medizinische Wochenschrift, 1886.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 14, p. 213\\" Morris made some experimenting with grafting of ovaries in rabbits. In his notes he recorded a frequent trouble in the effort to make one set of rabbits immune to blood serum of another set of rabbits. The main issue was that tissue of any sort taken from one individual and planted in another is physiologically a stranger. The subject of gland grafting engaged his interest in the Nineties. He also noticed that ovarian grafting was so much more frequently possible than testis grafting, first of all because of the number of women donors, which he reported were much more ready than men to sacrifice a solid organ. He performed the first human ovarian grafting in 1895. and so he published the same year a presentation of his idea of gland grafting, description of technique and a report upon cases. And in May 1906 he published a great report of the birth of a living child after heteroplastic ovarian grafting in the New York Medical Record. After this report, he received tons of letters from women who had lost their ovaries and wished to have a gland grafting. Some of them would offer a contingent fee, condition that Morris had never accepted, since he thought that such a fee would presuppose a work for the money regardless of the rendering of human service. Moreover, he was one of the founders of The American Society of Endocrinologists.\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 14\\" Furthermore, he adopted early intervention for appendicitis in 1890, and wrote about its treatment. Curiosities He is known for several aphorisms. Some of the best are \\"The last living thing on earth will most certainly be a microbe.\\" and \\"No one can be a one-hundred-per-cent doctor until he has himself had some serious illness or surgical operation.\\"\\"Fifty Years; A Surgeon, cpt. 15\\" Morris told the Cornell Club that World War One was like a Darwinian struggle, but that countries would better recognise the importance of mutual dependence, and he believed that races and hybrids of them depended on \\"protoplasm\\" for their success. He also argued that many great writers wrote how they did due to the influence of bacterial toxins on their brains.

History The site was first occupied following white settlement by Timothy Beard, who depastured cattle on the Limestone Plains as early as 1829. Beard had been transported to Australia for life and arrived in the colony in 1806. After receiving his pardon he entered the pastoral industry as a squatter. Beard's huts were located on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan and on the site of Lanyon homestead. Beard was forced out of the area by land grants and later became an innkeeper at Bringelly (Moore, 1982). Aerial view of Lanyon station in 1950 =The Wright family= James Wright and his friend John Hamilton Mortimer Lanyon settled at Lanyon in 1833 as squatters after arriving from London earlier that year. (James also took his wife and his 5 children with him.) In 1835 they purchased several adjoining blocks on the Murrumbidgee River, then the edge of legal occupation within the nineteen counties. Wright and Lanyon established an orchard, vegetable gardens, planted wheat and purchased cattle and sheep and set up a dairy herd. Fifteen convicts were assigned to Wright and Lanyon by 1835, increasing to thirty by 1837. Wright's elder brother William arrived in 1836 and purchased adjoining land. William died in 1837 following a shooting accident. Lanyon returned to England and died in 1841. Wright married Mary Davis in 1838 and the first three of their eight children were born at Lanyon. Wright encountered financial difficulties and was forced to sell Lanyon in 1841 and move to nearby Cuppacumbalong station. The Wrights had established a self-supporting community at Lanyon of up to 60 people. The design of Wright's courtyard buildings is said to be reminiscent of his native Derbyshire (ACT Government, 1994). =The Cunningham family= Lanyon was next purchased by Andrew Cunningham, a banker from Fyfeshire in Scotland. Cunningham arrived in Sydney with his family in 1845 and settled at Congwarra, north west of Lanyon. The Cunninghams built the present Lanyon homestead from local fieldstone in 1859. Lanyon was carrying 25,000 sheep by the time of Andrew Cunningham's death in 1887 and the Cunninghams had acquired five properties. Cunningham's sons James and Andrew Jackson Cunningham operated the properties in partnership, with James at Tuggeranong and Andrew at Lanyon. In 1905 Andrew Jackson married Louisa Leman and extended and redecorated the homestead. Andrew died in 1913 and Louisa sold the contents of the homestead and returned to Sydney. James Cunningham moved his family from Tuggeranong to Lanyon in 1915. =The Field family= After James' death in 1921 his son Andy oversaw Lanyon until 1926 when the property was sold to Harry Osborne of Currandooley, near Bungendore. The Osbornes sold the property in 1930 to Thomas Field who had large landholdings in New South Wales and Queensland. The Field family lived in Sydney but visited Lanyon often. They implemented major changes, including modern farming methods, large scale pasture improvement and irrigation of lucerne. By the late 1960s, the growth of the National Capital had necessitated the resumption of large tracts of farmland south of Canberra. Up to a dozen rural leases, in parts of South Woden and Weston Creek, were resumed to make way for development of Tuggeranong, the second of Canberra's urban satellitesNewman Chris (2004), Gold Creek, Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage, Gold Creek Homestead Working Group.

It housed a collection of the paintings of Sir Sidney Nolan. A purpose-built gallery for the Nolan collection was built in the grounds in 1980. An extensive conservation and restoration program was undertaken and the homestead is now managed as a house museum, within a working property, by the ACT Government and the National Trust of Australia (ACT). Lanyon Homestead was threatened by the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which also threatened the nearby township of Tharwa. On 18 January 2003, as fires were approaching Canberra, the homestead was hosting a wedding. The fire situation deteriorated, prompting the evacuation of Tharwa, which was defended and saved by Southern Rural Fire Brigades. The Lanyon Homestead was not impacted by fire, though it did come under ember attack. A single fire truck was on hand to hose down and protect the historic homestead. Given the age of Lanyon, this was certainly not the first time the property had faced bushfires. References *ACT Government (1994). Lanyon. ACT Government, Canberra. . *Gillespie, L (1991).

It concerns the problem found among some large businesses, with each side attempting to get their preferred standard form agreements to be the basis for a contract. Facts Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd made and sold machine tools. They sent a letter to Ex-Cell-O on May 23, 1969, offering Ex-Cell-O some new machinery for ¬£75,535. With it were Butler's standard contract terms. These included a price variation clause so that if their manufacturing costs went up, the price rise would be passed on to Ex- Cell-O. Ex-Cell-O replied on May 27 and said they would order the machinery, but on Ex-Cell-O's own standard terms. Ex-Cell-O's standard terms did not have a price variation clause. Butler replied on June 5. It replied on the tear-off slip from Ex-Cell-O's terms. At the bottom of this slip it read, \\"We accept your order on the terms and conditions stated therein.\\" But Butler added a letter reasserting that the deal was being made under Butler's own terms, from the May 23 letter. A while later, nothing further had been said, and Butler delivered the machinery. They asked for ¬£75,535, plus ¬£2,892 according to their price variation clause. Ex-Cell-O refused to pay the extra. Butler sued Ex-Cell-O. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the contract was on Ex- Cell-O's terms, and therefore the increase in price was ineffective. The majority followed a traditional offer and acceptance analysis. But Lord Denning MR's judgment took the approach that one should look for material agreement and the court should have the power to ignore irreconcilable terms. His judgment led as follows. Lawton LJ concurred. Bridge LJ agreed with the result. Significance As a result of the majority ruling in the Butler Machine Tool case, English law continues to approach the issue of the battle of forms from the viewpoint of analysing the communication between the parties to see if it can be discerned into an offer and acceptance. An example of a different theoretical approach to resolving the \\"battle of forms\\" issue can be found in Article 19 of the Vienna Convention for the International Sale of Goods, which provides: > # A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains > additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer > and constitutes a counter-offer. # However, a reply to an offer which > purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms > which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an > acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the > discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, > the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications > contained in the acceptance. # Additional or different terms relating, among > other things, to the price, payment, quality and quantity of the goods, > place and time of delivery, extent of one party's liability to the other or > the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer > materially. Please note: The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the > International Sales of Goods has been ratified by 78 states. The United > Kingdom is not one of those 78 states.

Amnesty International is an organization of more than 7 million supporters, activists and volunteers in over 150 countries, with complete independence from government, corporate or national interests. Amnesty International works to protect human rights worldwide. Its vision is one of a world in which every person - regardless of race, religion, gender, or ethnicity - enjoys all of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards. Since its foundation in 1966, the United States section, made up of over 350,000 members, of the nonpartisan organization has worked to free prisoners of conscience, oppose torture, and fight other human rights violations around the world. It seeks to promote human rights in the United States through lobbying and education, and describes itself as working for full human rights for everyone. Campaigns Amnesty International USA's Security with Human Rights campaigns strongly against torture, unlawful detention, and prisoner abuse, particularly by United States military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The organization has opposed restrictions of human rights as part of the 'War on Terror', and does not believe that any torture or inhuman treatment is justified by the campaign against terrorism. The Security with Human Rights campaign also strongly advocates for the rights of victims of armed groups as well as accountability for those individuals and states that use torture, in order to end cycles of violence and increase overall global security against terrorism and human rights violations. Amnesty International USA publicly objected to the use of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp when it was opened in January 2002 because of its use to detain individuals without giving them due process or habeas corpus. As well as later in January 2009, when Susan J. Crawford, who was appointed by President Bush to be the Convening Authority for the Guantanamo military commissions became the first Bush administration official to concede that at least one individual was tortured at Guantanamo Bay. Affirming Amnesty International's position that Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's explanation for Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp's existence was because of its optimal setting for interrogation and prosecution of extraordinarily dangerous persons for war crimes was in from Amnesty's view a thinly veiled excuse for allowing the use of torture. Amnesty International USA holds that all detainees should be either given a fair trial in federal court or be released. In Amnesty International USA's campaign for Individuals at Risk (IAR), protections for anyone who is threatened of having their human rights violated because of who they are or what they believe is the mission. To do this, IAR attempts to lobby both from the grassroots and State level by facilitating response, exposure and relevance especially in priority cases like the one of Shaker Aamer, a Guantanamo Bay detainee who has been cleared multiple times for release to the United Kingdom. As of February 2015, Aamer has been unlawfully detained for over 13 years and Amnesty International USA released Shaker Aamer's case of their website with the option to ‚Äútake action‚Äù by sending a direct message to President Barack Obama calling for Shaker to be either charged and tried or immediately released to United kingdom. The organization is currently active in campaigns to stop violence against women as part of an international campaign to see full human rights for everyone. My Body, My Rights! is a global campaign for the right to make decisions about a person's own \\"health, body, sexual life, and identity without fear of coercion or criminalization. Seek and receive information about sexuality and reproduction and access related health services and contraception. Decide whether and when to have children, and how many to have. Choose your intimate partner and whether and when to marry. Decide what type of family to create. Access family planning; contraception; safe and accessible post-abortion care; access to abortion in cases of rape, sexual assault, or incest, and pregnancy that poses a risk to the life or to physical or mental health; and, where legal, access to safe abortion services and \\"live free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including rape and other sexual violence, female genital mutilation, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, forced sterilization and forced marriage.\\" Women are the largest oppressed demographic in the world and Amnesty International USA works to educate not only heterosexual women about their bodies and human rights but persons of every sexual orientation and gender identity. AIUSA strongly opposes the use of the death penalty in the United States, in accordance with the policy of the international organization; Amnesty calls for its worldwide abolition, particularly in the USA, China, Iran, and Vietnam ‚Äî four countries that make up the overwhelming majority of executions. AIUSA board member William F. Buckley resigned in January 1978 in protest over the organization's adoption of this stance on this issue. The Darfur conflict in Sudan is one of Amnesty International's top priorities, as a result of the large scale human rights abuses occurring there. Amnesty has called for the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force to prevent conflict and stop further unnecessary suffering.

Roughly bounded by 38th Street, 39th Street, Avenue G, and Duval Street, the district includes several homes of historic interest from the turn of the twentieth century, including the Col. Monroe M. Shipe House, Hildreth-Flanagan-Heierman House, Frank M. and Annie G. Covert House, Page-Gilbert House, Smith-Marcuse-Lowry House, and the Oliphant-Walker House. This subdivision was platted by Hyde Park founder Monroe Shipe and indicated by concrete markers, some of which still stand today. Shipe's own home is located at the corner of 39th Street and Avenue G. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Shadow Lawn's historical significance stems from the architecture of its houses. The district features a number of dwellings with modest Tudor Revival detailing characteristic of historicist \\"cottage\\" bungalows built in the 1930s. The dominance of this architectural form is an important feature that distinguishes the district from nearby housing clusters, as no other area in the northern suburbs of Austin contains as high a concentration of Tudor Revival dwellings. Unlike the bungalows in the nearby Hyde Park Historic District, these houses utilized more expensive masonry veneer rather than cheaper wood siding.

It was released in Japanese (December 22, 2005) and European (2006) arcades running on System 256 hardware, and later for the PlayStation 2 (Japan: June 29, 2006; US, July 18, 2006; PAL, July 28, 2006). The game was developed by Arika and Crafts & Meister, headed by Noritaka Funamizu (a former Capcom fighting game producer who worked on the Street Fighter series and Darkstalkers). The game features 18 playable characters, destructible environments, and a game engine geared towards fans of more traditional fighting games. The game sold 95,082 units in the first week of its release in Japan, placing its rank at #2 in the software sales in Japan for that week, second to Nintendo's New Super Mario Bros.. The game sold 370,000 global copies.  Game play  Shifting away from the gameplay of recent series such as the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai and the Budokai Tenkaichi games, Super Dragon Ball Z brings its style back to a more traditional formula made famous with the Capcom, SNK, etc. games of the 1990s. \\"Fireball motions\\" and the like provide the majority of special move inputs, along with \\"dial-a- combos\\" (as seen in Mortal Kombat 3 and the Tekken series) for closer, hand- to-hand combat. Some characters (Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Trunks, etc.) have brief power-ups into their Super Saiyan forms. Characters have \\"super moves\\", throws, juggles, dashes, etc. that can trace their roots back to these earlier 1990s games. = Game modes (home version) = ;Original A basic arcade mode, in which the player can use either a normal, or custom character to fight their way through seven opponents (receiving a Dragon Ball for each victory) and gain experience on the way. The sixth opponent will always be Frieza and the seventh opponent will always be Cell. ;Z Survivor A \\"survival\\" mode in which the player fights various opponents for as long as their health remains above zero. Battles all take place in the world tournament ring (with the same background music each time), and last a single round. If the player wins the round, they play a \\"roulette\\"-style game in which their selection endows them with items such as additional experience, extra health, Dragon Balls, etc. If using a custom character, the player will gain experience. ;Training A mode where the player can perfect their skills against a computer opponent (stationary, responsive, etc.). Battles take place within Vegeta's training room. ;Versus A standard two-player versus mode. Players may use either the default characters or their own custom versions from either memory card slot. ;Shenron Summon Upon collecting seven Dragon Balls with a custom character, the player may enter this mode to summon Shenron. The player may then wish for various items, such as additional attacks, unlockable characters, etc. After making a wish, the Dragon Balls disappear and must be recollected in another game mode. ;Customize The player may set up \\"custom\\" characters to battle with. These characters will gain experience from fighting, which allows them to learn new special attacks, raise statistics, etc. There are 30 available slots for custom characters. Custom characters may be used in Original, Z Survivor, Training, Summon Shenron, and Versus modes. Characters can be equipped with certain badges and certain items that make them unique from other customizations.  Development  The game's theme throughout its presentation is that of the manga. Color schemes, art styles, and even loading screens are all nods to the original Japanese Weekly Jump serialization and collected tankob≈çn run of the series. For example, the orange on Goku's gi is not in the saturated shade of vermilion depicted in the TV series; images on the main menu are significant colored images from the manga; loading screens mirror the original Japanese tankob≈çn cover art; sound effects are written out during battle when an excessively-hard hit connects; etc. = International versions = Atari have made a few alterations to their North American version of this release. The opening song, \\"Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 ver.)\\" has been replaced with an unknown techno instrumental similar to Bruce Faulconer's work. Also, the Japanese manga-style sound effects have been altered to an English translation, apparently to help with the translation of the game. Finally, there is no option for the Japanese voice actors, which completely contrasts the previous North American releases of Sparking!, Budokai 3 (GH), and even the PlayStation Portable's Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai. The PAL version has the same opening song and manga-style sound effect translations as the US version, but alternatively retains the Japanese voice actors with no option to change to the English cast (similar to the release of the PAL version of Budokai). However, there would seem to be one optional Japanese voice actor from Atari left in. Jouji Yanami is evidently one of the unlockable \\"Narration\\" voices for the game, even credited in the \\"Original Mode\\" ending sequence. Despite this, there is no slot for his voice in the unlockable Narrator wishes, so this may have just been left in by accident. The game was released at retail price of $40 and is the 6th Dragon Ball Z game to be released in North America on the PlayStation 2 (7th counting the Greatest Hits release of the Budokai 3). But overall, other than the alterations mentioned above, nothing is removed/cut from the game. The Dr. Slump character, Suppa Man, is even retained in the \\"Eastern Capital\\" level. Super Dragon Ball Z is one of three games packaged together and released as Dragon Ball Z Trilogy. The other two games in the bundle are Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi and Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2.Amazon.com: Dragonball Z Trilogy: Video Games = Music = The opening theme for the Japanese version is \\"Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 ver.)\\" as performed by Hironobu Kageyama. This is a remix of the first Dragon Ball Z TV opening theme, released as a CD single in 2005 with variations of it and the second opening theme, \\"We Gotta Power\\", also included on the seven-track CD (Sony Music / Team Entertainment, KDSD-74). The score of the game features at least two remixes of background music composed for the Dragon Ball Z TV series by Shunsuke Kikuchi. Other pieces are newly composed for this game. All pieces are upbeat, blippy-techno style. Reception Super Dragon Ball Z was met with average reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 74.38%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100.

P. Lovecraft. Publication history Created by game designer Robert \\"Mac\\" McLaughlin, the first edition of the game was published in 1997 by Chaosium as a 154-page softcover book, with cover art by Bob Berta. A second edition and four supplements were published over the following years by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2006, a third edition was published by Skirmisher Publishing LLC. Setting Like Call of Cthulhu, this game is set in the 1920s. Players take on the role of ordinary folk (lawyers, private eyes, etc.) who are drawn into investigating the rise of occult horrors in their neighbourhood. Gameplay Rules have been deliberately streamlined to accommodate the live-action aspect. Character have only four attributes: Dexterity, Education, Constitution, and Power, as well as a number of Sanity Points that represent mental stability. The player can then buy a number of skills from a list. When a character wants to try a task, the referee assigns the task a difficulty, and then compares the difficulty to the character's relevant skill. If the skill equals or exceeds the difficulty of the task, then the character succeeds. Reception In the November 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue 241), Rick Swan \\"adored\\" the game, although he admitted it had a few problems. Swan believed the live-action game needed 10-15 participants, far more than a normal role-playing game. And he found the combat system \\"awkward\\".

His apprenticeship was postponed for 3 years because his father retired due to ill health after being in the business over in 20 years. His parents thought it was best if he first got an education. After finishing school Kim Andersen trained as a confectioner before he first became an apprentice to the champion trainer Franz Nutz. At the time Nutz already had a number of apprentice jockeys in his care who helped teach Andersen the business. The first year as an apprentice there were no victories, but he persevered and won his first race a year later.

The district provides for citizens in southeast King County and operates 6 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, and the district's sole high school, Tahoma High School. Approximately 8,500 students are served by the district, which covers the entirety of Maple Valley, Ravensdale, and Hobart, portions of Renton, Covington, and Black Diamond, and a significant area of unincorporated King County.https://washington.hometownlocator.com/schools/profiles,n,tahoma%20senior%20high%20school,z,98042,t,pb,i,1120426.cfm The district is bordered by Enumclaw School District to the south, Snoqualmie Valley School District to the east, Issaquah School District to the north, Renton School District to the northwest, and Kent School District to the west.http://www.k12.wa.us/SchFacilities/maps/SchoolDistrictsESDsWithCounties.pdf History The Tahoma School District was founded in 1926 when the Taylor, Hobart, and Maple Valley school districts agreed to merge. The school district's name is derived from the first two letters of each of the independent school districts that merged, thus TaHoMa; a nearby peak of Mount Rainier named Mt. Tahoma also influenced the name. In 1927, the new district constructed a three-story junior-senior high school, TaHoMa High School, in Hobart. The building still stands today; it was renovated in 1977 to become just a junior high school, and in 2004 was renovated once more to become Tahoma Middle School. In 2017, it yet again was renovated and reopened as Tahoma Elementary School. As the district grew, another secondary school became necessary due to building constraints. A building for 8th and 9th grade students was constructed and opened to 350 students in 1961, near Petrovitsky in northern Maple Valley. It would remain a secondary school until 1977, when it became an elementary school. In the years following that, the school switched between being a secondary or primary school numerous times, due to new schools being built. Throughout the 2000s, it was a middle school, since Shadow Lake Elementary School was just across the street. In 2017, it again became an elementary school, as Cedar River Elementary School. In the late 1900s, numerous new schools were constructed. The modern-day Glacier Park Elementary School, Lake Wilderness Elementary School, Shadow Lake Elementary School, and Rock Creek Elementary School all were built then, and similar to Cedar River, shifted between grades frequently. Enrollment continued to grow, and in 1974, a new high school was opened in the western Maple Valley area. The school was originally an open-concept design, without many interior walls separating classrooms. Within a year, the school reverted to a more traditional design, as walls were installed due to teacher dissatisfaction. In 1999, an intensive remodel of the Tahoma Senior High School building commenced, along with construction of a new junior high school, Tahoma Junior High School, for grades 8 and 9, in Ravensdale. Following voter approval of a $10 million, four-year Instructional Technology Levy in 2006, the Tahoma School District outfitted the campus with wireless internet service, Activboard digital whiteboards, and upgraded computer labs.http://www.k12.wa.us/safs/PUB/LEV/0607/levy06.pdf The building faced struggles with overcrowding throughout the 21st century as Maple Valley experienced rapid growth. The district installed 17 portable classrooms, many of which were purchased for $1 from the neighboring Kent School District. These dilapidated rooms helped to drive voters to approve a $195 million bond in 2015 to build a new high school for the community.voteyestahoma.com/frequently-asked-qs/ Ground was broken that year, it was completed in 2017, and it opened for the 2017-2018 school year, returning 9th graders to the high school. The high school was completed under budget, allowing for the reconstruction of Lake Wilderness Elementary School; the once-dilapidated structure was torn down and replaced with a two-story building. The previous Senior High building was converted to Maple View Middle School, and the previous Junior High building was converted to Summit Trail Middle School.

The teacher was very popular within the community, having recently won a 'Teacher of the Year' award from the local chamber of commerce, and the community was divided over these accusations. Facing criminal charges and a job-termination hearing, he committed suicide. Many in the community were angered at the harsh treatment given to the teacher, with at least one parent directly blaming Ed Heiser, the superintendent, for the death.https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1993/03/17/25crisis.h12.html Heiser himself would resign in 1993 after accusations of making inappropriate sexual remarks. The district received further backlash in 1992 when it was uncovered that Tahoma Junior High teacher Ron Lawrence was allowed to continue teaching after admitting to previous sexual encounters with students. In 1994, a student accused Tahoma High teacher and head football coach Doug Wilson of sexual misconduct. He was placed on administrative leave, and soon resigned.https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19940302&slug;=1898065 On December 9, 2016, the district did not delay or close schools during a major winter storm, opting instead to only use limited bus routes. Multiple high school students were involved in accidents on SE 240th Street, the road leading to the then-high school (now Maple View Middle School). The road was closed down by the King County Sheriff's Office, further delaying students and staff. The district apologized for the mistake and superintendent Rob Morrow took responsibility; he retired from his position the following year. In 2017, a letter sent by Tahoma head football coach and athletic director Tony Davis to a King County judge was uncovered by parents. The letter listed donations that an alleged child molester had made to Tahoma's football program. Many parents took this as a letter of support for the child molester, and since the letter was sent with a Tahoma School District letterhead, the district was accused of also supporting this individual. Davis apologized and stated he did not condone the individual's actions in any way, while Tahoma stated that Davis's views did not reflect those of his employer and the district letterhead should not have been used. Davis was disciplined for the incident. On September 30, 2019, Tony Giurado abruptly resigned as superintendent of the district, after serving for just over a year.https://www.king5.com/article/news/education/tahoma-school- superintendent-abruptly-resigns/281-46dc3ed2-3dc1-4d79-9bea-a6c8c4ebb507 A statement from the district read: Former Tahoma superintendent Mike Maryanski was chosen to serve as the interim superintendent for the remainder of the school year.https://voiceofthevalley.com/2019/10/30/maryanski-named-interim- superintendent-for-tahoma-school-district/  References  External links *Tahoma School District Website Category:School districts in Washington (state) Category:Education in King County, Washington ","title":"Tahoma School District"},{"id":"5675967","text":"Langford village sign Langford is a village and civil parish in the Central Bedfordshire district of the county of Bedfordshire, England about south-east of the county town of Bedford. The 2011 census gives the population as 3,091. Geography Langford lies alongside the River Ivel about south of Biggleswade, south-west of Cambridge and north of London. The East Coast Main Line railway passes through the parish at the eastern edge of the village. Landscape The village is within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands National Character Area (NCA 88) as defined by Natural England. Central Bedfordshire Council has classified the local landscape as Lower Ivel Clay Valley for the northern part of the village and parish and Upper Ivel Clay Valley for the southern part. Large, open arable fields dominate to the east of the village. Henlow Common and Langford Meadows local nature reserve is beside the Ivel. Lakes formed from old sand and gravel quarries are to the south of the village. Seven of the ten wind turbines commissioned in 2013 at Biggleswade Wind Farm are within the parish. Each tower is tall with four blades. To the southeast of the village is a solar farm commissioned in 2015. The two installations have electrical generating capacities of 20 MW and 13 MW respectively. Elevation The village centre is above sea level. The land rises to over towards Topler's Hill in the east of the parish. Geology and soil type Langford village lies on river gravel and the arable fields to the east on boulder clay over gault. The village itself has highly fertile, freely draining, slightly acid but base-rich soil with a loamy texture. By the Ivel are loamy and clayey floodplain soils, with moderate fertility and naturally high groundwater. To the east are highly fertile, lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage. Roads and footpaths The B659 road (formerly A6001) (High Street/Church Street) is the main route through the village, leading north to Biggleswade and south to Henlow. Cambridge Road runs east to the A1 road from the southern end of the village. Station Road links Church Street to Cambridge Road. A public bridleway leads from Common Road to Henlow. Separate footpaths from Station Road and Cambridge Road join to reach Astwick and Stotfold. There are paths from East Road to Biggleswade. The night sky and light pollution The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Langford is in bands 4 and 5. History The village is of Saxon origin, first mentioned in 944 AD and at one time it had one or more fording points across the river. The name is based on the words long ford from the length of the settlement. At the time of the Domesday Book 1086, the population was around 21. The parish church is St. Andrew's, which is part of the Church of England. Before 1066 the lord of Langford was Lewin, a thane of Edward the Confessor. William the Conqueror granted the village to Walter le Fleming. In 1142 Walter's descendant Simon de Wahull gave land to the Knights Templar, who established themselves as Lords of the Manor of Langford Rectory.'The People at the Long Ford' by Michael Rutt ‚Äì pub. Bedfordshire County Council 1975. The entry in the Domesday Book reads: Langeford: Walter of Flanders. 2 mills. Langford has been a settlement on the east bank of the river Ivel since Saxon times. It is a long straggling village which at one time had two or three fording points over the river, hence its name. The village now starts at the Baulk corner and it is nearly three miles to the Running Waters at the north end of the village. Governance Langford Parish Council consists of ten elected councillors. Langford is part of Stotfold and Langford ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority. Prior to 1894, Langford was administered as part of the Hundred of Biggleswade. From 1894 until 1974 it was in Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District. Langford was in the Mid Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency until 1997. Now in North East Bedfordshire, the elected member is Richard Fuller of the Conservative Party. Facilities Langford Village Academy for four to nine year olds is part of the Bedfordshire Schools Trust (BEST). OFSTED rated the school as \\"good\\" following an inspection in 2017. The Plough, Church Street, first licensed in 1846 is the one remaining pub. The building was formerly a farmhouse. A small shopping parade on Church Street near to East Road includes a convenience store, Chinese takeaway, pharmacy and hair salon. A convenience store on High Street includes the village Post Office. The King George V Playing Field has a children's play area and exercise equipment for adults. The village hall is within the grounds. Both are owned and maintained by the parish council.

Churches The parish church of St Andrew is part of a united benefice with the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Henlow. Regular Sunday morning services are held. The Methodist Chapel is in the North Bedfordshire Circuit. Services take place each Sunday morning. The Chapel was constructed in 1862. The organ, built in 1845, was initially installed at St John the Baptist Church, Windsor before being sold and transferred here in 1906. In 2000, the organ was issued with an ungraded Historic Organ Certificate. Buildings and monuments Upon entering the village from Biggleswade is a terrace of ten cottages dated 1862: the Denny Cottages are of yellow brick with red brick trimmings. All bar one have arched front windows and doors. The Clock Tower Memorial commemorates soldiers who lost their lives in the 1914‚Äì18 and 1939-45 World Wars. Housing developments The village has grown considerably since 1961. Housing on Riverside Gardens, at the southern end of the village between the Ivel and High Street was built in the late 1960s, followed by nearby Wilmon Court and Ivel Close in the 1980s. More recently, Garfield, off Station Road, comprising 58 properties was completed in 2010 on former scrubland. The pace of development has accelerated following Central Bedfordshire Council's initial call for sites in 2014. At the north of the village on the western side of Church Street is a development of 35 properties called Rowley Fields, built in 2018 on a former meadow. Off the east side of Station Road, 110 houses have been built at Bramble Corner, Mayflower Lane, Campion Edge and Elderberry Close and off the west side another 25 at Merryweather Grove. 22 houses have been completed at Steamer Croft beside the railway off Cambridge Road.

Facts Photo Productions Ltd engaged Securicor to guard their premises at night. A night- watchman, Mr Musgrove, started a fire in a brazier at Photo Production's factory to keep himself warm. The fire spread accidentally\\"accidentally\\": there were suspicions of arson, but insufficient evidence to prosecute. and the Photo Productions plant was totally destroyed by fire, causing ¬£648,000-worth of damage. When Photo Productions sued, Securicor argued that an exemption clause in the contract excused liability. The clause provided: \\"under no circumstances shall Securicor be responsible for any injurious act or default by any employee‚Ä¶ unless such act or default could have been foreseen and avoided by the exercise of due diligence on the part of [Securicor].\\" Photo Productions argued that the clause could not apply under the doctrine of fundamental breach, that the breach of the contract went to the root of the contract, it invalidated the whole agreement and extinguished the exclusion clause. Judgment =Court of Appeal= Lord Denning MR held that the doctrine of fundamental breach did apply, and that Securicor was liable.[1978] 1 WLR 856 He said if the breach was fundamental then the exclusion clause would be invalid, following his decision in Harbutt's \\"Plasticine\\" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd.[1970] 1 QB 447 He said the following.[1978] 1 WLR 856, 865 Shaw and Waller LJJ concurred. Securicor appealed. =House of Lords= The House of Lords overturned the Court of Appeal and held that Securicor's exclusion clause was effective and exempt it from liability for damage. Lord Diplock held that the clause‚Äôs effectiveness was a question of construction of the contract, and that it did cover the damage. He noted ‚Äòthe reports are full of cases in which what would appear to be very strained constructions have been placed upon exclusion clauses‚Äô though the need should have gone since the passage of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Lord Wilberforce, writing for the Court, overturned Denning and found that the exclusion clause could be relied upon. Wilberforce explicitly rejected Denning's application of the doctrine of fundamental breach and opted for a \\"rule of construction\\" approach. Exemption clauses are to be interpreted the same as any other term regardless of whether a breach has occurred. The scope of the exclusion is determined by examining the construction of the contract. On the facts, Wilberforce found that the exclusion clause precluded all liability even when harm was caused intentionally. He went out of his way to disapprove the doctrine of fundamental breach of contract. Significance The case is remembered for these principal reasons: * first, the explicit rejection of the doctrine of fundamental breach under English law (and hence, by extension, for much of the common law world); and * secondly, it is remembered as the high-water mark of the disputes between the Denning-led Court of Appeal and an increasingly unamused House of Lords, who strongly disapproved of Denning's attempts to remould the law in a manner that he perceived to fit the justice of the situation before him. * thirdly, the case is a strong confirmation of the principles of the Suisse Atlantique case, which may now be considered the final statement of the common law prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

Among her more frequent collaborators are Yuen Biao, Lai Kai Ming, and Wong Jing. Her early roles were primarily cute and comedic, while her more recent, post-divorce roles, have primarily been dramatic. She was discovered as a teenager by a Japanese talent scout. Like many movie stars in Hong Kong, she has also pursued a career as a singer, touring in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, and she has released more than half a dozen CDs.http://www.abcde.com.hk/gloria/profile.html (in Chinese) In her homeland, she retains a reputation for wholesomeness, a childlike face described as \\"forever 19 years old,\\" and the philandering of her husband, leading to a divorce in 2000, caused a media stir. While she was married, she went into semi-retirement, enjoyed being a mother, and pursued interests in arts and crafts, primarily embroidery and clay sculpture. She graduated from Hong Kong Art School in 2008. She is fluent in Cantonese, Japanese, Mandarin, and English and is a fan of Jackie Chan (with whom she has worked), Tom Cruise, Rie Miyazawa, and Madonna.English-language bio screen, Saga of the Phoenix DVD, Universe Laser & Video Her roles in Mark Six Comedy and Boxer's Story include brief passages of English dialogue. Discovery by talent scout During secondary school at St. Margaret's Women's Academy, she went to Japan, and was discovered by a talent scout. She was only thirteen (though she claimed at the time to be fourteen), took a Japanese name, and appeared in television commercials for McDonald's and TDK. Her career continued from there. In 1987, at age 14, she appeared in the play, Âë∑ÈÜãÂ§ß‰∏àÂ§´ (The Real Man Sips the Vinegar or Goodbye Darling).http://ueno.cool.ne.jp/sankyoh/profile.htm (in Japanese) At age 19, she appeared in another play, Ê¥óËÖ≥Ê∞¥ (The Water for Foot Washing) (1992).http://big5.cri.cn/gate/big5/gb.cri.cn/9964/2006/11/13/114@1299634_4.htm (in Chinese) Film career: first phase She frequently appears in comedian supporting roles, such as Su Rongrong (known simply as \\"Ron\\" in the English subtitles), an acrobatic acupuncturist in The Legend of the Liquid Sword, or the just slightly-too-young bounty hunter Fung Ling (\\"Little Bewitchment\\") in Flying Dagger. Her most noted role is Ashura the Hell Virgin, a major supporting role in Peacock King, which is usually cited as her screen debut at age 15.English-language bio screen, Saga of the Phoenix DVD, Universe Laser & Video. Chicken and Duck Talk premiered in July 1988 and Peacock King in December 1988, but the latter, being a special effects film, probably took longer to complete. Also, in the former, she is seventeenth billed, has no lines, and has less than a minute of screen time and a starring role in Saga of the Phoenix. This role is also quite comic and often slapstick. She plays a mischievous but essentially innocent offspring of devils. She possesses great power, but essentially as a vessel for others to wield, or for her to use when she is not really trying, and thus she is a source of great danger without any malice. In both films, her character is redeemed when she helps her friends Peacock King/Kujaku (Yuen Biao) and Lucky Fruit (played by different actors in the two films), who act as her guardians, destroy major demons. The role was more demanding in the second film, in which her childlike innocence and mischief is somewhat quelled by a mystical death sentence that attacks her like a disease. Released half a year prior to Peacock King was the multi- award-winning comedy, Chicken and Duck Talk. Her role is limited to less than a minute of screen time, playing Judy, friend of Michael Hui's son. Judy is referred to several times, is glimpsed briefly in David's Chicken, and appears in the duck restaurant at the film's finale, and never speaks, though she is spoken to. In Demoness from Thousand Years, she appears only at the beginning and end of the film and is listed twelfth in the screen credits, though promotional materials, including the DVD cover, feature her prominently and give her second billing. Her character, Siu-Yi, carries the weight of a second lead in her included scenes as companion to Yun Yu-Yi (Joey Wang), but is unconscious throughout most of the film's narrative, being frozen in the pre- credits sequence and revived during the climax, communicating with Yu-Yi through a television set, and appearing as a doll vendor in the last scene. Prior to these roles, she appeared in the 22 October 1987 and 11 November 1997 episodes of the television series, Goodbye Darling.http://ueno.cool.ne.jp/sankyoh/movies1.htm (in Japanese) She often plays roles that are younger than she is in real life, abetted by the fact that she is just under 5'2\\". In Saviour of the Soul, she played Andy Lau's 12-year-old kid sister, Wai Heung, who is enamored with baseball, when she was eighteen. Her other roles include the young bride, Belle Kao, in Jackie Chan's Miracles, in which much of the film's narrative is driven by her character's wedding; Gucci (a confident and witty bank robbery hostage) in The Blue Jean Monster, the mysterious Alien Girl in The Cat, Ann in Pink Bomb, and a cameo as Ricki's murdered girlfriend, Ying, in Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky. Of all her films, Story of Ricky (as it was known in English in Hong Kong) has received the widest release in the United States, thanks to promotion by Comedy Central, although its Category III rating made it a minor film in Hong Kong. Marriage, retirement, arts and other activities Her goal was to make a film that she herself would particularly like, and as such she is not particularly prolific as Hong Kong film actors go. She retired from the screen after appearing in the 1994 film, The Gods Must Be Crazy V: The Gods Must Be Funny in China, to marry toy businessman Èô≥ÊüèÊµ© (Chen Pak Ho) on May 25, 1995, and the birth of a son, Èô≥Á¥πËáª (Chen Siu Chun), followed in February, 1996. The couple had a daughter, Èô≥Ë°çË°ç (Chen Hin Hin), whose name translates \\"Spread Out,\\" November 30, 1999. Her husband refused to pay alimony so she struggled financially to raise her two children. Reports revealed that, initially, she took up many behind-the-scenes production jobs because of her difficulty to obtain significant film roles. Yip continued to appear on television to demonstrate her hobby of embroidery, and she also wrote a magazine column on arts and crafts. In 1997, she enrolled at Causeway Bay School to study clay sculpture.http://www.mingpaosf.com/htm/News/20070215/HK-mca1.htm Article by Kei Mei in Chinese She graduated from Hong Kong Art School on January 27, 2008,http://hk.myblog.yahoo.com/gloriayip_hkcca/article?mid=143 (in Chinese) with her porcelain thesis work, ÊàÄÁâ©/Materialism (2007).http://hk.myblog.yahoo.com/gloriayip_hkcca/article?mid=147 (in Chinese) Yip also completed a master's degree in fine arts at Australia's RMIT University in 2013. Her artworks, particularly her sculptures, have earned her awards. For instance, she was the only Hong Kong representative to qualify in the top thirty at the Arte Laguna Prize, an Italian competition for visual art pieces. She also has an art studio school, which she founded with close friends in Tsim Sha Tsui. Yip is also a very vocal supporter of the Umbrella movement, which emerged during the Hong Kong democracy protests in 2014. She often used her social media presence to send strong messages of support to students who participated in the 79-day occupation of key areas of the Admiralty, Causeway Bay, and Mong Kok. Yip, herself, went to the Admiralty and Causeway Bay to tie yellow ribbons on street railings and signposts. Divorce and return to film In January 2000, Yip and Chen were divorced at Chen's suggestion after he had an extramarital affair and was visiting brothels. She returned to the screen in 2001 with a cameo role in Heroes in Love after Chen failed to pay her allowances.Hong Kong Cinemagic - Gloria Yip Wan Yihttp://gd.sohu.com/20041227/n223660697.shtml (in Chinese) Details of the affair were exposed to the media in 2002, including Yip publishing excerpts from her own diary concerning her feelings. After nearly a ten-year absence, Yip had the leading role in the horror film, Death Melody (2003), followed by another horror film, Double Face Girl. She also returned to stage plays. During this later period, she has largely abandoned her comedic persona. In 2004, while Mark Six Comedy places her in a comic foil role as the manager (named Gloriaspelled \\"Goria\\" in the only two subtitles that name her, but contradicted by the attempts at proper pronunciation on the soundtrack) of an office of immature twentysomethings, deriving humor through being serious, in both Boxer's Story, a drama, and Osaka Wrestling Restaurant, a comedy, she plays serious roles as ex-wives of unsuccessful men, each with a son. In the latter film, she is not involved in any of the comic antics whatsoever, and structurally, her role, a \\"special appearance\\" with only four scenes, is designed to give the film an emotional core it might otherwise lack. In the former film, she plays the ex-wife of a character played by Yuen, and much of the film is about regaining her son now that she is married to a cardiologist and has a successful career of her own in automotive sales, primarily to English-speaking clients. In Breezy Summer, her role, again eponymous, is a tragic performance. Later that year, she was reunited with Story of Ricky star Fan Siu Wong and The Cat star Christine Ng in the television miniseries, Magic Sword of Heaven and Earth, as the goddess Guanyin, which aired in 2005. This role, again serious, is a figure of divine intervention at the second act turning point, and a brief visit in the film's finale. Most of these were low budget productions shot on digital video rather than on film. In 2007, she appeared in Magic Boy. When she appeared in 2013 to promote 2014 TVB Series, Never Dance Alone, the media was shocked at changes in her weight, her grey hair, and overall matronly look, describing her as \\"a replica of a gray-haired Lan Jieying\\". (Lan is six years Yip's senior.)Meng Hao. \\"ÊòîÊó•ÁéâÂ•≥ËëâËòäÂÑÄÈ´îÂûãÊìÅËÖ´ÊªøÈ†≠ÁôΩÁôº ‰ººÁøªÁâàËóçÊΩîÁëõ\\" Takungpao, June 7, 2013 Friends described her as unrecognizable, fat, and foregrounded their fear of marrying the wrong person. Music The musicians who perform with Gloria Yip on her albums include Ricky Ho, Belinda Foo, Iskandar Ismail (keyboards), Eddie Marzuki, Jonathan Koh, Shah Tahir (guitars), Stephen Rufus (saxophone), Larry Lai (flute), and Jimmy Lee (cymbals). The songs are composed by many different people, as are the lyrics, though Yip sometimes writes her own lyrics, such as for \\"Ë´ã‰Ω†Á≠âÁ≠â\\" (\\"Invites You and So On...\\").

The first actress to play the character on a contract basis was Addison Hoover, who joined the show in April 2005 and left the following year. From July 11, 2006 to December 9 2008, Phoebe was played by MacKenzie Mauzy, until the character was killed off. Phoebe and her twin sister, Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), were born in September 1999 to Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). As a result of constant SORASing, Phoebe was seventeen by 2006. The character has been described as an \\"ill-fated beauty\\". Creation =Casting= After being played by a range of child actors, Brynne McNabb began portraying Phoebe in January 2002, and departed in August 2003. Chandler Mella took over from January to March 2004, followed by Keaton Tyndall from April to December 2004. Addison Hoover played the role from April to September 2005. Phoebe has been aged multiple times; first in January 2002, when she was aged to 6. In 2004, she was aged to pre-teen, and by 2006 was nearly 20 years old. Mauzy relocated to Los Angeles to be on The Bold and the Beautiful. In May 2008, Steffy, who had been out of town since December 2006 was re-cast with Jacqueline MacInnes Wood; the character was re-written as fraternal twins. On July 3, 2008, it was announced that Mauzy was now on a recurring status, as the actress had been cast in the Broadway production of A Tale of Two Cities. Her last appearance was on December 9, 2008, when the character was killed off =Development= Phoebe had a major romance with Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), her legal uncle, although they are not blood related. At the time of the storyline, Mauzy was just 18 years old. Lowder stated that she was \\"so mature for her age\\", and that off-screen the actors did not feel \\"awkward\\" as they formed a bond which translated well on-screen. Prior to Rick, Phoebe had a brief attraction to Shane McGrath (Dax Griffin). Mauzy observed that the writers initially had Phoebe \\"so creeped out by him, but now, she's turning around and falling in love with him\\", a switch she called \\"fun\\" and \\"a challenge to figure out\\" as an actor. Mauzy and co-star Lowder are both singers off-screen, which prompted executive producer Bradley Bell to have both sing on the soap. Speaking of how this came about, Mauzy said, \\"It kind of evolved. I think I talked to Brad about having done theater in the past. One day, he called me and asked, 'Do you want to start singing on the show?' I said, 'Absolutely!'\\" In August 2007, former American Idol contestant Constantine Maroulis was cast as record promoter Constantine Parros on the show, with Phoebe as his protege. On the website for his company Boldface Records, he and Phoebe post a duet they recorded together, and another duet she recorded with now ex-boyfriend Rick, asking viewers to select their favorite. The series aired a special concert with Constantine, Phoebe, Rick, and recording artists Elliott Yamin and Jon McLaughlin. Maroulis told People \\"[My character] becomes sort of fixated on Phoebe\\" who is \\"beautiful and young and very, very talented\\". Mauzy said that Maroulis' character \\"adds such a great dimension to the show\\", and described filming Phoebe and Rick's duet as \\"the ultimate form of expression, because you're really putting yourself out there\\". The actress found that shooting the concert before a live audience was \\"a different energy\\" from where the soap is usually filmed, in a studio. Storylines =1998‚Äì2006= Phoebe and her twin, Steffy, were born onscreen on September 21, 1998, to Ridge Forrester (Ron Moss) and Dr. Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo). Taylor nearly died giving birth to them after suffering from tuberculosis. Steffy was named after her grandmother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). In February 2001, Ridge and Taylor took the twins and Thomas to Saint Thomas, where they renewed their wedding vows. The family, along with the babysitter Catherine, then took a boat trip, and two-year-old Steffy fell overboard during stormy weather and was presumed eaten by sharks. However, Steffy turned up weeks later at Morgan DeWitt's house. Morgan, an old flame of Ridge's who desperately wanted to have his child, had kidnapped her and was holding her captive. Taylor grew suspicious of Morgan and was shocked to discover Steffy in her house. As Taylor was about to take her daughter home, Morgan returned and held them both captive. Ridge eventually saved his wife and child by driving his car through Morgan's house as she was about to shoot Taylor. Morgan was eventually committed to a psychiatric institution. Family problems continued to spiral when Taylor was presumed dead after being shot by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown), Steffy and her siblings wanted Bridget Forrester to live with them and raise them. Instead, Ridge married Brooke Logan a woman he had been involved with and engaged to prior to meeting Taylor. A new addition, R.J Forrester was added to their family when Brooke and Ridge had their first child together before Ridge and Brooke married. Years later, Taylor was revealed to be alive and Ridge and Taylor renewed vows. The following year, they split up due to Taylor revealing the truth about her sleeping with a man named James in 1993. Phoebe believed that her older brother Thomas' (Drew Tyler Bell) relationship with illegal immigrant Gaby Moreno (Shanelle Workman) was what divided Ridge and Taylor, and informed Taylor that the two had sex, knowing that this would cause Taylor to have Gaby deported. Taylor did call the immigration department, but was unsuccessful in convincing them to deport Gaby. After Taylor's second death from a gunshot wound, Brooke and Ridge married and she moved in with the family. Later Phoebe and Steffy chose to go to boarding school to gain more of their own independence. =2006‚Äì2008= On July 11, 2006, Phoebe returned to Los Angeles to see her family, and explained that Steffy had opted to stay in London, where they were on vacation. As she was driving home one night she got a flat tire. Her aunt, Darla (Schae Harrison), arrived to help her fix it. While strenuously pulling, Darla was jolted back onto the road and run down by a drunken Taylor who was coming to Phoebe's rescue. This resulted in Darla's death. Phoebe, Hector Ramirez (Lorenzo Lamas), and Phoebe's grandmother Stephanie all conspired to keep Taylor's part in Darla's death a secret. Phoebe being the emotional twin, feared losing her mother again and begged for her mother to remain silent which Taylor gladly went along with. Phoebe had taken a liking to gardener Shane McGrath (Dax Griffin), who was a witness to Darla's accident. However, there has been a growing attraction between Phoebe and Rick (Kyle Lowder) since his return from Europe. It has been explained that Phoebe and Rick are technically not related, as Phoebe's father Ridge is the son of Massimo Marone and not Eric Forrester while Rick's father is Eric. The Forresters are strongly opposed to the growing relationship between Rick and Phoebe. Phoebe's recent friendship with singer Constantine Parros has caused some friction between her and Rick. Constantine, who saw her and Rick singing in a video posted by Rick's friend C.J. Garrison offered for them to join his label, Boldface Records, but Rick declines while Phoebe agrees, much to Rick's dismay. Rick believes that Constantine has an \\"ulterior motive\\" to his relationship with Phoebe and is determined to find out what he can all while he hides his affair with Ashley Abbott. Rick and Constantine make a bet, to which Phoebe reluctantly agrees, that they will both sing at C.J's cafe Insomnia with Phoebe. The flirtatious and complicated triangle between Phoebe, Rick, and Constantine continues. Eventually Constantine 'moves on' with Rick's half-sister Felicia ending the love triangle between them and Phoebe. For a while, Rick and Phoebe were happy, despite the disapproval from both of their families, but then Phoebe was devastated when she discovered Rick had slept with Ashley so she broke things off. About a year later Phoebe suddenly says she still has feelings for Rick, but Rick has fallen in love with her mother Taylor. Phoebe then went to Australia, unaware of Rick and Taylor's feelings. Meanwhile in L.A., Taylor told Rick that she loved him. When Phoebe returned, she walked in her mothers room and saw Rick and Taylor kissing on the bed. After seeing how upset Phoebe was Taylor broke it off with Rick because her love for her daughter was more important to her than her love for Rick. Then later Phoebe calmed down and told her mother and Rick (in front of Brooke and Ridge) that she would not stand in the way of their love because she understood how being in love felt. Brooke was very upset and begged Taylor to leave her son alone. Phoebe left to tour with a band but returned to Los Angeles for her father's upcoming wedding to Brooke Logan. She told her mother that she stayed away on tour and promoting Forrester Creations's new fragrance \\"Phoebe\\" because she didn't want to see her mother and Rick together. Phoebe talked with Steffy about Rick's recent antics toward their father. What she didn't expect to hear was her sister's confession that Rick had recently kissed her, against Steffy's will. Extremely furious, Phoebe told Steffy she had to make a stop before going to Ridge and Brooke's wedding rehearsal party. Hurt, angry and immaturely thinking that Rick had used her, her mother, then her sister Phoebe argued with Rick in his office at Forrester Creations then followed him to his car to continue the argument. She told Rick to pull over but he refused wanting to get to the rehearsal and away from Phoebe as quickly as possible. Phoebe commence to pummel Rick furiously yelling and screaming causing it to be hard for him to control the car. She also unknowingly placed her foot atop his on the accelerator flooring the gas which led to a very bad car crash. After the accident, Rick very injured, in pain, and dizzy from a head injury managed to walk to Eric's house for help. He encountered Ridge in front of the house trying to call Phoebe and got him to help. Ridge went with Rick to the site of the accident and found a barely conscious Phoebe. As he called to her she woke up and began to sing the song she wrote for Ridge and Brooke's wedding then died in her father's arms. Ridge screams out in horror at the site of Phoebe's death, and her family mourns her. Rick is initially blamed for the crash, but evidence later comes to light that Phoebe was attacking Rick when he lost control of the car. In 2019, Steffy names her adoptive daughter after Phoebe, although ends up giving her up after it transpires that she is the stolen baby of Liam Spencer and Hope Logan Reception In 2007, Soap Opera Digest named Mauzy their annual \\"Hottest Newcomer\\" on soaps, noting that she had been \\"thrown into heavy story right away\\" upon her casting.

Often referred to as \\"Swede Hill.\\" Development of this area began in the 1870s when numerous Swedish immigrants erected homes near their downtown businesses. The first to build his home there was S. A. Lundell; soon thereafter Carl John Swahn built his house there, and many others followed. Eventually some sixty-seven Swedish immigrant families built homes in the vicinity and the neighborhood became known as Svenska Kullen (Swedish Hill)‚Äîoriginally bounded by Waller Street on the east, Red River Street on the west, 15th Street on the south, and 19th Street on the north (today Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) ‚Äî known more familiarly as Swede Hill. These immigrants founded the first Swedish Methodist Church in Texas, and helped to establish Texas Wesleyan College, just north of the present-day University of Texas. Today the community comprises an eclectic mix of students and urban dwellers. Over time, urban development, most notably the construction of I-35 and the Frank Erwin Center, shrunk the size of the community dramatically. In 1986, what remained was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Description and significance Located on lots in the original City of Austin and subdivided and developed earlier than most other parts of East Austin, Swedish Hill was a residential neighborhood occupied by downtown business people and tradesmen. Its significance derives not only from the broad range of architectural styles which is represented in the District, but also from the fact that each building is an excellent example of its own particular style. Architectural styles which are represented in the District are vernacular versions of the Victorian L plan, T plan, Cumberland plan, late Victorian corner-porch plan, Pyramidal plan, and Bungalow plan. All of the buildings are finely detailed; many display pleasing carpentry ornamentation in the forms of porch columns, balusters, railings, brackets, spindles, and a variety of siding and shingling types.

Following his retirement in 1938, he became controversial for his fiercely anti-immigrant and antisemitic views. Early life and career Moseley was born in Evanston, Illinois, on September 28, 1874. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the cavalry. He served in the Philippines twice, from 1900 to 1903 and 1906 to 1907, where his assignments included commanding a troop of the 1st Cavalry and serving as Aide-de-Camp to Generals J. M. Bell and J. M. Lee. In 1901 Moseley, accompanied by only one other officer, without escort and under conditions of great danger, penetrated a major Philippine insurgent stronghold. 2nd Lt. Moseley and 1st Lt. George Curry convinced Brigadier General Ludovico Arejola to sign the peace agreement in Taban, Minalabac (Philippines) on 25 March 1901. The honor graduate of the Army School of the Line in 1908, he also graduated from the Army Staff College in 1909 and the Army War College in 1911. During World War I, Moseley served as assistant chief of staff for logistics (G-4) on the staff of the American Expeditionary Force headquarters. Moseley married Mrs. Florence DuBois in July 1930.TIME: \\"Milestones, Jul. 7, 1930, accessed March 26, 2011 He held camp and Washington assignments from 1920‚Äì1929. He was a member of several important commissions, including the Harbord Commission to investigate Armenian issues. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, in 1921 he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the newly created Bureau of the Budget. In 1921 he was promoted brigadier general, Regular Army. Commanding the 1st Cavalry Division (1927‚Äì1929), he successfully interceded, under fire, with principals in a 1929 Mexican insurrection. His actions stopped stray gunfire from Juarez, Mexico, from endangering life and property in adjacent El Paso, Texas, and precluded further incidents. In 1931 he was promoted major general, Regular Army. Senior assignments He was the executive for the Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1930 and Deputy Chief of Staff of Army from 1930 to 1933.Weintraub, 12 He served as General Douglas MacArthur's Deputy Chief of Staff during the 1932 Bonus March on Washington, D.C., in the course of which he recorded his fears of a Communist conspiracy against the United States and his identification of Jews with radicals and undesirables. He wrote in a private letter:Bendersky, 202-3 In 1934, he asked MacArthur to consider the immigration issue in terms of military manpower, contrasting a group of \\"southern lads\\" of \\"good Anglo-Saxon stock\\" with their counterparts from the North with names \\"difficult to pronounce\\" that \\"indicated foreign blood\\". Moseley linked the latter to labor problems and \\"so much trouble in our schools and colleges.\\" MacArthur expressed skepticism in response to Moseley's argument that \\"It is a question of whether or not the old blood that built this fine nation ... is to continue to administer that nation, or whether that old stock is going to be destroyed or bred out by a lot of foreign blood which the melting pot has not touched.\\"Bendersky, 216 He was Commanding General of the 5th Corps Area, from 1933 to 1934 and 4th Corps Area from 1934 to 1936. His final assignment was as commander of the Third United States Army from 1936 to 1938. Controversy While still on active service, Moseley expressed controversial opinions in public. In 1936, he proposed that the Civilian Conservation Corps be expanded \\"to take in every 18-year-old youth in the country for a six-month course in work, education and military training.\\"TIME: \\"Conservation: Poor Young Men,\\" February 6, 1939, accessed March 26, 2011 In the late 1930s, when admitting refugees from Nazi persecution was a matter of national controversy, Moseley supported admitting refugees but added the proviso \\"that they all be sterilized before being permitted to embark. Only that way can we properly protect our future.\\"Bendersky 250 Retirement Moseley retired from the Army in October 1938 with a statement that described the New Deal as a growing dictatorship: \\"We do not have to vote for a dictatorship to have one in America ... We have merely to vote increased government responsibility for our individual lives, increased government authority over our daily habits, and the resultant Federal paternalism will inevitably become dictatorship.\\" Secretary of War Harry Woodring called his statement \\"flagrantly disloyal.\\" In April 1939 he attacked Jews and said that he foresaw a war fought for their benefit. He attacked President Franklin D. Roosevelt for appointing Felix Frankfurter to the U.S. Supreme Court. He predicted that the U.S. army would not follow the orders of FDR's leftist Administration if they \\"violate all American tradition.\\" He described fascism and nazism as good \\"antitoxins\\" for the United States, adding that \\"the finest type of Americanism can breed under their protection as they neutralize the efforts of the Communists.\\"TIME: \\"National Affairs: Moseley Roars,\\" April 10, 1939, accessed March 26, 2011 Time reported his view that \\"more money should be spent on syphilis prevention and less on national defense\\"TIME: \\"Moseley's Day Off,\\" October 10, 1938, accessed March 26, 2011 Two months after leaving the military, he questioned the President's proposed increases in military spending: \\"Much of our present weakness is in the fear and hysteria being engendered among the American people for ... political purpose. ...

In Philadelphia, he told the National Defense Meeting that Jewish bankers had financed the Russian Revolution and that \\"The war now proposed is for the purposes of establishing Jewish hegemony throughout the world.\\" He said that Jews controlled the media and might soon control the federal government.Bendersky, 255 In June 1939, Moseley testified for five hours before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He said that a Jewish Communist conspiracy was about to seize control of the U.S. government.

According to McDonough, while he and Chad Gray wrote the lyrics to \\"Nothing to Gein\\", Greg Tribbett performed a riff which alternated in bars of four and five.

It is known from a subfossil sternum and some other bones, and the descriptions of Leguat (1708) and Julien Tafforet (1726). Taxonomy This bird was assigned to the genus Alectroenas, but this was erroneous. It is most similar to that of the ground doves (Gallicolumba) or to a miniature version of the sternum of an imperial pigeon (Ducula). If this similarity is not based on convergence, considering the evolutionary relationships of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues pigeon is quite possibly the closest relative of the Raphidae that was still alive in historic times. This does not mean that there is any close relationship between this bird and the didine pigeons, only that both derived, independently, from the same Indo-Asiatic lineage, which became extinct millions of years ago. Two tarsometatarsi were attributed to this species. Today, they are believed to represent another taxon, closer to the Malagasy turtle dove (Nesoenas picturata), and thus the name Rodrigues turtle dove also refers to the present species. Description It was a bird the size of a tambourine dove and colored slate grey. Leguat and his companions took a fancy to these tame and confiding birds and had several dozen birds attending their outdoor table at mealtime to wait for scraps; they were especially fond of melon seeds. In 1693, the bird was found foraging on the island, but nested only on offshore islets which the rats that had been introduced at some time in the 17th century had not yet reached. Behaviour Leguat described its behaviour as follows: Extinction Tafforet's report is the last record of this species. It can be assumed to have gone extinct in the mid-18th century, when rats finally overran its nesting sites.

It is widely distributed in China and is cultivated extensively there. It is found in forests, thickets, banks of streams and foothills at elevations of 500 to 1,300 metres.Plants for a Future This species looks much similar to Camellia sasanqua except the dark green, evergreen leaves are a bit larger, three to five inches long and two to three inches wide. Single, white, fragrant flowers are produced in mid to late fall, and this large shrub or small tree will reach a height of 20 feet with thin, upright, multiple trunks and branches. The crown forms a rounded or oval vase with lower branches removed.Camellia oleifera Uses The seeds of Camellia oleifera can be pressed to yield tea seed oil, a sweetish seasoning and cooking oil. In tea seed oil, oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid comprises ~80% of the total fatty acid content - the oil is similar in composition to olive oil. Tea oil is also known as \\"Tea Seed Oil\\" when sold as cooking oil in supermarkets throughout Australia, New Zealand and the United States.Antioxidant Activity and Bioactive Compounds of Tea Seed (Camellia oleifera Abel.)

Open from October 6, 1942, until June 30, 1944, it was the last American concentration camp to open and the first to close. At one point it held as many as 8,497 detainees.Japanese American Internment Sites Preservation \\"Japanese American Internment Sites Preservation\\" , a report from the National Park Service.Niiya, Brian. \\"Jerome ,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 5 August 2014. After closing, it was converted into a holding camp for German prisoners of war. Today, few remains of the camp are visible, as the wooden buildings were taken down. The smokestack from the hospital incinerator still stands. Jerome is located southwest of the Rohwer War Relocation Center, also in the Delta. Due to the large number of Japanese Americans detained there, these two camps were briefly ranked as the fifth- and sixth-largest towns in Arkansas. Both camps were served by the same rail line. A high granite monument marks the camp location and history. The marker is located on US Highway 165, at County Road 210, approximately 8 miles south of Dermott, Arkansas. On December 21, 2006, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 1492 into law authorizing $38,000,000 in federal money to preserve the Jerome relocation center, along with nine other former Japanese internment camps. The PBS documentary film Time of Fear explores the history of these two American concentration camps in Arkansas. History of the camp After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought the United States into World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was lobbied to sign Executive Order 9066, which authorized military leaders to declare the West Coast a military zone from which persons considered \\"a threat to security\\" could be excluded. Some military leaders opposed this action, and historians have concluded that the order was based largely on local exaggerated fears and xenophobia, plus economic competition. Officials classified most Japanese Americans as potential threats, including native-born citizens. They forced the \\"evacuation\\" of 120,000 Japanese Americans; whole families were rounded up and deported to concentration camps newly constructed in isolated areas of the country's interior. The Jerome War Relocation Camp was located in Southeast Arkansas in Chicot and Drew counties. It was one of two American concentration camps in the Arkansas Delta, the other being at Rohwer, north of Jerome. The Jerome site was situated on of tax-delinquent land in the marshy delta of the Mississippi River's flood plain, which had been purchased in the 1930s during Depression relief efforts by the Farm Security Administration. Despite initial resistance from Governor Homer Adkins ‚Äì who agreed to allow the camps only after exacting a federal guarantee that the Japanese American inmates would be watched by armed white guards and removed from the state at the end of the war ‚Äì the War Relocation Authority acquired the land in 1942. Along with other Southern states, Arkansas had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow laws; they had already disenfranchised most African Americans in the state at the turn of the century. The A. J. Rife Construction Company of Dallas, Texas, working under the supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers, built the Jerome camp at a cost of $4,703,347. The architect, Edward F. Neild of Shreveport, Louisiana, also designed the camp at Rohwer in Desha County. Inclement weather at the Jerome Relocation Center Jerome was divided into 50 blocks, which were surrounded by a barbed wire fence, a patrol road, and seven watchtowers. Administrative and community spaces such as schools, offices and the hospital were separate from the 36 residential or barracks blocks. These consisted of twelve barracks divided into several \\"apartments\\", in addition to communal dining and sanitary facilities. Approximately 250 to 300 individuals lived in each block. The only entrances were from the main highway on the west and at the back of the camp to the east. The camp was not finished when its first inmates began to arrive from California assembly centers. These early arrivals were forced to work on construction of their incarceration quarters. Jerome Relocation Center, 1944 This was the last center to open and the first to close; it operated for 634 days ‚Äì the fewest of any of the American concentration camps. The constant movement of camp populations into and out of facilities has made accurate statistics difficult. As of January 1943, the camp had a population of 7,932 people, and the following month Jerome reached its peak at nearly 8,500. Most prisoners had lived in Los Angeles or farmed in and around Fresno and Sacramento before the war, but some ten percent of Jerome's population was relocated from Hawai'i. Fourteen percent were over the age of sixty, and there were 2,483 school-age children in the camp, thirty-one percent of the total population. Thirty-nine percent of the residents were under the age of nineteen. Sixty-six percent were American citizens, having been born in the United States, and were known as Nisei. The Issei, or first- generation, immigrant parents and grandparents had been prohibited by US law from obtaining citizenship, along with other East Asians, were officially referred to as \\"aliens\\". The camp was closed at the end of June 1944 and adapted as a German prisoner-of-war camp, renamed as Camp Dermott. Due to questions about their loyalty due to answers to the confusing loyalty questionnaire, many Japanese American male inmates had already been transferred to the Tule Lake segregation camp in California. The remainder of the prisoners were sent to Rohwer in Arkansas and the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona, constructed on the Pima/Maricopa reservation. Camp life and social clubs An adult education class at the Jerome Center Adult camp residents worked at farming, the saw mill, or making soap. The barracks were small and poorly insulated. Sometimes several families had to share a one-room \\"apartment\\", which did not provide enough room for even one family. Project Director Paul A. Taylor warned residents that leaving the camp without permission and trespassing on private property were punishable offenses. Having thousands of people living in such dense quarters increased their risk of disease. In January 1944, influenza spread throughout the camp for several months. The hospital at Jerome was acknowledged as the best equipped and best staffed of any WRA center, and provided enough medical assistance to alleviate most health problems. The residents of the camp were resourceful, forming social and culture clubs. The Jovial Peppers was a group of girls, ages 9 to 12. The Phi Beta Society consisted of a group of young women whose main purpose was to improve their cultural background. Other clubs included Cub Scouts and the Double X's. Recreation and sports were very popular. Sports consisted of basketball, weightlifting, boxing, wrestling, and volleyball. Basketball drew the most attention from sports lovers. In one match noted as an \\"annihilation\\", the Shamrocks defeated the Commandos 19-2. Frank Horiuchi got credit for the lone basket on the losing side. Art classes and piano lessons were offered. Adult education classes included English, sewing, drafting, flower arrangement, commercial law, photography and art. Dances and movies were frequently available. Resistance to military enlistment and the loyalty questionnaire As at the other WRA camps, many of the Nisei (second-generation, American-born) young men were recruited to volunteer for the armed forces. All adults were required to submit to an assessment of their loyalty to the United States. Pressure to join the all- Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team was somewhat higher at Jerome and Rohwer, which were much closer to the unit's training facilities at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. These camps became popular destinations for 442nd soldiers on leave. Col. Scobey, executive to the Assistant Secretary of War, visited Jerome on March 4, 1943 to persuade eligible internees to enlist in the 442nd. He said that the War Department was in effect presenting the 442nd as a test of loyalty, and if few men signed up, the public would believe the Nisei were not loyal Americans. Eventually, 515 men https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nihl23t9tg7uxv/AAAUYc2PkAR72q99FMxy7jGfa/14)%20SOLDIERS%20AND%20CAMPS?dl=0&preview;=!SOLDIERS+AND+THE+CAMPS+(Alphabetical)+646B.pdf&subfolder;_nav_tracking=1 volunteered or were conscripted for the legendary 100th Infantry Battalion, the famed 442nd RCT, and the MIS. The so-called \\"loyalty questionnaire\\" met with resistance in Jerome (and elsewhere) largely because of the last two questions. They were poorly worded, and made insulting assumptions. Some men whose English was more limited had trouble interpreting them; other understood enough to be offended. One question asked if US-born men would be willing to serve in the military. The second asked all respondents if they \\"would disavow their allegiance to Japan\\", but most had no allegiance to that country. Many were confused by the questions' wording, unsure if an affirmative answer to the second would be taken as an admission of previous disloyalty and a threat to their families. Others, especially among the citizen Nisei, were offended by the implication that they were somehow un-American yet ought to fight to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and overridden their rights.Lyon, Cherstin M. \\"Loyalty questionnaire ,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 5 August 2014. Due to an earlier dispute with administration over working conditions in Jerome and the death of an inmate in an on-the-job accident, tensions in camp were already high. In separate incidents on March 6, 1943, two men seen as administration collaborators were beaten by inmates. Jerome inmates subsequently gave negative or qualified responses to the question regarding Japanese allegiance at a rate higher than at any other WRA camp. Mitsuho Kimura was one of six members of a committee of inmates who conferred with Director Paul Taylor and said that they would protest the WRA's Evacuee Registration Program (the official name of the loyalty assessment program). Kimura, who was born in Hawai'i in 1919 and attended high school in Japan from 1932 to 1935 before returning to the U.S. territory, was described by a Naval Intelligence informant as a \\"very dangerous type of individual.\\" He said that he was loyal to Japan before Pearl Harbor, and that his loyalty to Japan had increased after Pearl Harbor. He asserted that he would not fight in the U.S. Army under any conditions, but would readily fight in the Japanese Army against the United States. He organized group meetings at Jerome with other pro-Japanese inmates. The committee refused to register because they were loyal to Japan. 781 evacuees in the group registered by writing across the face of the registration form that they wanted to be repatriated or expatriated to Japan. Leave clearance at Jerome Camp residents were allowed to leave the camp with permission in order to take jobs on the outside. However, many did not want to leave without the guarantees of food and a place to stay provided by the camp. Another drawback to was that the process of getting a leave clearance was slow, causing some to lose interest. The draft and registration processes also complicated getting a leave clearance. Camp closing Former residents Clara Hasegawa and Tad Mijak take a last look at the camp from a watchtowerThe Jerome Relocation Camp closed on 30 June 1944 and was converted into a holding camp for German prisoners of war. According to U-boat commander Hein Fehler of U-234 food allocation at the camp while he was there was very poor.A. V. Sellwood The Warring Seas, Universal-Tandem Publishing 1972 pp. 213-18 Today there are few remains of the camp standing, the most prominent being the smokestack from the hospital incinerator. A 10 foot high granite monument marks the camp location and gives details of its history. The Jerome Relocation Center operated for a total of 634 days, the least of any of the American concentration camps. Riots and isolated confrontations erupted in response to administration of the loyalty questionnaire. But the Denson Tribune reported on June 11, 1944 that the \\"camp was free from juvenile delinquency (...) young girls and boys are well- behaved, well disciplined, well-trained, well-taught, and well led. Rowdyism, pranks, swearing, petty theft and juvenile vices are practically nil.\\" There were no reports of vandalism. This contrasts with poorer results in some of the other camps. Once the camp was closed, the remaining residents were transferred. Heart Mountain received 507 residents, Gila River received 2,055, Granada received 514, and Rohwer received 2,522.

Frisco High School is the only known high school in the United States to have a raccoon as an official mascot. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  History  Frisco High School was founded in 1902. The original building no longer exists, but other previous locations still do: the Frisco ISD Student Opportunity Center (on Maple Street in \\"Center City\\" Frisco) was Frisco High School for many years; in fact, the words \\"Frisco High School\\" are still etched into the stone above the main entrance. In 1973, a new high school facility was built just north of this location and used for many years; this school building is now used as a middle school: Staley Middle School. Then, another new building, at Stonebrook Parkway and Parkwood Boulevard, was constructed in the 1990s; designed by architecture firm Corgan, it still serves as Frisco High School today. At the beginning of the 2000s, Frisco's explosive population growth required the opening of a second high school named Centennial High in east Frisco, at Coit Road and Rolater Road. Frisco ISD's third high school, Wakeland High, opened in 2006 in northwest Frisco on Legacy Drive. This, like the opening of Centennial, also cut a large chunk out of Frisco High's attendance zone. The opening of now rival Wakeland High School, was vital, in that it relieved the infamous overcrowding at Frisco High; ever since Wakeland opened, FHS's total enrollment has always been below the building's capacity of 1800 students. However, the population of Frisco continued to grow; therefore, Rick Reedy High School opened in 2015, on Stonebrook Parkway just east of Teel Parkway, to relieve congestion at Frisco High. Reedy High School is Frisco ISD's eighth high school. The most recent attendance total for FHS is 1575 students, keeping the campus at its desired 5A Classification.https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2015/08/24/careful- planning-pays-off-at-friscos-new-reedy-high-school A significant addition and remodel to Frisco High School began during the summer of 2012, to increase the building's capacity to 2100 students and to update the school's facilities to the level of quality enjoyed by the other, newer high schools in the district. The project included the construction of a new auditorium, orchestra room, gymnasium, library, and parking lot, as well as an expansion of the cafeteria into the current auditorium. The previous marching band practice field was paved over to create the new parking lot, which was necessary because the new auditorium displaced a large number of the old parking spaces. The project was expected to be completed in summer of 2013, but was finished later in 2013.

Superintendent Rick Reedy and board member Jimmy Gaffney supported the change, while some area residents opposed the change. The change meant the sole water tower at the time was to be repainted.

The community has a partial presence in Person County. The population was 1,662 at the 2010 census. It was named in honor of longtime resident William Lea and is located along US 158 and NC 119 near Hyco Lake. Leasburg is also the name of a Caswell County township. History When Caswell County was created in 1777, the area that would become Leasburg was named as the county seat; however a county courthouse was not built on the site until 1784 after the American Revolutionary War. When the area around the courthouse began to develop, the community decided to incorporate. The town of Leasburg was officially recognized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1788. When the eastern section of Caswell County split and became Person County, a more geographically central location for the Caswell county seat was needed; so, in 1792 the courthouse was moved to an area which became known as \\"Caswell Court House\\", which later changed its name to Yanceyville. Leasburg continued to develop after the courthouse relocation and eventually became known as the regional center for education. Numerous mills, factories, and farms prospered in the town until competition nearby from Durham doomed the area's tobacco industry. The Civil War left Leasburg in ruin, although many antebellum residences still remain. Famous former residents of Leasburg include Solomon Lea, the son of William Lea and the first president of Greensboro College, and Jacob Thompson, who served under President James Buchanan as Secretary of the Interior.

In 1925 WDBX's power was increased to 50 watts,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin\\", April 1, 1925, page 11. and its call sign changed to WOKO.\\"Stations Broadcasting\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the United States (Edition June 30, 1925), page 67. In mid-1926 the station was purchased by Harold E. Smith and moved north of New York City to Peekskill.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1926, page 8. In early 1928 the station made a move further north, setting up the station's transmitter on Mount Beacon\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1928, page 5. in southern Dutchess County and serving Poughkeepsie and Newburgh from the Hotel Windsor in Poughkeepsie.\\"WOKO\\", The Airwaves of New York: Illustrated Histories of 156 AM Stations in the Metropolitan Area, 1921-1996 by Bill Jaker, Frank Sulek and Peter Kanze, 1998, page 153. WOKO was billed as \\"The Voice from the Clouds\\" for its transmitter site on one of the highest mountains in the Hudson Valley.\\"Mount Beacon, Beacon, N.Y.\\" by Scott Fybush, June 18, 2010. Mount Beacon was actually a poor selection for an AM station transmitter site, due to the mountain's poor ground conductivity. However, its high altitude has made it ideal for FM and TV stations, including WSPK 104.7 FM, which can be heard throughout parts of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont with a good radio. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, WOKO was assigned to 1440 kHz.\\"Broadcasting Stations, by Wave Lengths, Effective November 11, 1928\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the United States (Edition June 30, 1928), page 175. The Newburgh-Poukeepsie area of the Hudson Valley was still largely undeveloped, with few advertising opportunities. Without a network affiliation, and limited nighttime hours due to having to share its frequency with WHEC-WABO (now WHIC) in Rochester, the station was unprofitable. In late 1929 Harold E. Smith contacted Sam Pickard, vice president in charge of station relations for the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network, to see if WOKO could become a CBS affiliate. Pickard determined that as it stood the station was not qualified, however, it would if it were to move to Albany and expand its hours of operation.\\"Docket No. 6486\\", Federal Communications Commission Reports (Vol. 10: April 2, 1943-June 30, 1945), pages 454-469. =Move to Albany= WOKO received approval from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to make the changes suggested by Pickard, and on April 17, 1931 was authorized to begin broadcasting full-time from Albany on 1430 kHz. It was the first radio station licensed to New York's state capital, although WGY had been broadcasting from nearby Schenectady since 1922. The station became profitable, due to its expanded hours of operation, combined with the ability to carry CBS's dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" With the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement in March 1941, stations on 1430 kHz, including WOKO, shifted to 1460 kHz, its assignment ever since. =License revocation and reassignment= WOKO's license came up for its periodic renewal on October 1, 1942. However, as part of the proceedings the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched an investigation into whether the station owner, WOKO, Inc., was no longer qualified to be a licensee, because it had repeatedly been deceptive in fully disclosing the company's stockholders. It was eventually determined that, in return for his aid in the station acquiring the CBS network affiliation, Sam Pickard had received control of 240 shares of the company's 1,000 shares of stock, although WOKO's financial reports to the FRC and the FCC in the subsequent twelve years had concealed this information. In 1943 Sam Picard's wife, Francke, attempted to dispose of the 240 shares for $75,000, but the FCC blocked the sale. On March 27, 1945, the Commission \\"concluded that the applicant cannot be entrusted with the responsibilities of a licensee\\" and denied renewal of WOKO's license. This ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which reversed the FCC's decision on the grounds that \\"The denial of renewal because of the applicant's failure to show the beneficial ownership of twenty-four per cent of its capital cannot be justified as a penalty for making false statements.\\"\\"WOKO, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission\\" (153 F.2d 623), The Federal Reporter (Appeals Court Cases Argued and Determined, Second Series, Volume 153 F.2d, 1946), pages 625-633. However, on subsequent appeal the Supreme Court reversed the Appeals Court decision, and ruled on December 9, 1946 that FCC's deletion of WOKO was appropriate.\\"Federal Communications Commission v. WOKO, Inc.\\", United States Reports Volume 329: Cases Adjudged in the Supreme Court at October Term, 1946, pages 223-229. At this time WOKO was one of only two stations licensed to Albany, so to limit the disruption of the station going silent the FCC issued a series of temporary authorizations allowing it to continue broadcasting until its successor was operational. A hearing was held reviewing three competing applications for WOKO's replacement, and on October 21, 1947 the FCC chose the Governor Dongan Broadcasting Corporation.\\"Van Curler Broadcasting Co. et al.\\" Federal Communications Commission Reports (Vol. 12: July 1, 1947-June 30, 1948), pages 313-341. Although technically this was a new station unrelated to the original WOKO, the fact that the new station inherited the WOKO call sign and frequency meant that functionally it was a continuation of its predecessor. As of January 1, 1947 WOKO's CBS affiliation had been lost to upstart WTRY (now WOFX) in Troy,\\"CBS Drops WOKO For WTRY; Better Coverage, No Blush\\", The Billboard, August 3, 1946, page 10. and WOKO evolved into a locally based format independent of any network, consisting largely of music, a rarity in a medium market in that era. The station also carried Brooklyn Dodgers baseball games in the 1950s before the team's move to Los Angeles. In the 1950s and early 60s, WOKO aired a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports. In an opening paragraph of Ian Fleming's 1962 novel The Spy Who Loved Me, protagonist Vivienne Michel travels to central New York state and recounts listening to WOKO, with the parenthetical comment \\"they might have dreamed up a grander callsign!\\".The Spy Who Loved Me by Ian Fleming (1962) - Project Gutenberg Canada. Retrieved August 6, 2018. =Country music= In the late 1960s, WOKO decided to go after an audience that was not well-served in the Capital District. Under station manager Charles Murn, WOKO flipped to country music. Charlie Heisler was the Chief Engineer. In the early 1960s, WOKO's lineup was led by Geoff Davis (formerly of WROW-Albany and WINS-New York City). Bob Cathcart, from Hoosick Falls, was the News Anchor. The station's country format lasted until 1978 after competition from FM rival 107.7 WGNA-FM led WOKO to change formats. For a short time it tried disco music. Coming into the format right after the peak of the disco fad and having to battle two decades of country heritage, the new format failed. In early 1980, WOKO returned to country. Though initially regaining some audience, the flip of the more powerful 1540 WPTR to country later that year wiped away any gains the station had made. =All News and Oldies= On August 23, 1982, WOKO ended its second attempt at country by flipping to an all-news radio format, carrying the audio from CNN Headline News (then CNN2) most of the day with sports from the Enterprise Radio Network at night. With this flip came the new call sign: WWCN, with the last two letters standing for CNN. Though low in overhead, the new station also retained the low ratings of the previous format and soon added some talk programming. WWCN continued to struggle and left the format in early 1987. The demise of WWCN led to the return of the WOKO call letters, this time running an oldies format and converting to C-QUAM AM stereo (only the second station in the market, behind WPTR, to do so). This format was short lived. WOKO was purchased by Barnstable Broadcasting, then owners of WGNA-FM, with the sale closing in late 1988. Barnstable then took WOKO to a WGNA simulcast most of the day. It did air some separate special programming and Albany-Colonie Yankees games, when not carrying country music programming. The AM station switched its call sign to WGNA while the FM station became WGNA-FM.In 1990, the WOKO call letters resurfaced in Burlington, Vermont, at a newly launched country station at the behest of an employee who wished to honor the original WOKO. This arrangement would last for over a decade through several owners. Regent Communications acquired WGNA-AM-FM in 2000, and the 1460 frequency was put up for sale. =Radio Disney= In March 2002, Regent sold the station to the Walt Disney Company, which converted it to the Radio Disney children's radio format. It was the only Disney-owned outlet in Upstate New York, although a local owner in the Syracuse area converted one of his AM stations to Radio Disney as well. The call letters for 1460 were then changed to WDDY.The WDDY call letters had been used from 1956‚Äì1988 by a small Gloucester, Virginia station (now WXGM). The Disney format lasted more than a decade. But in June 2013, Disney put WDDY and six other Disney stations in medium-sized radio markets up for sale, in order to refocus the network's broadcast distribution on Top-25 markets. On September 29, 2013, WDDY dropped the Radio Disney programming and went dark.Radio Disney Places Stations On The Market (September 30) - RadioInsight.com =Catholic Radio= In October, Disney filed to sell WDDY to Pax et Bonum, owner of 89.9 WOPG-FM in Esperance. The acquisition was made to improve the signal for Catholic Radio in the Capital District. Pax et Bonum converted the station to noncommercial operation as a simulcast of WOPG-FM's Catholic radio programming, from studios at the AM station's Delmar transmitter site. The sale was consummated on January 17, 2014, the station resumed operations on January 29, 2014, and its call sign was changed to WOPG on February 27, 2014.

It is based on Daniel Auber's operetta Fra Diavolo about the Italian bandit Fra Diavolo. Plot In the early 18th century, the bandit Fra Diavolo returns to his camp in Northern Italy to tell his gang members about his encounter with Lord Rocburg and Lady Pamela. Disguised as the Marquis de San Marco, he rides with them in their carriage and charms Lady Pamela into telling him where she hides her jewels. He orders his thieves to ride to Rocburg's castle and steal his belongings and Pamela's jewels. Meanwhile, Stanlio and Ollio have also been robbed, whereupon Stanlio suggests to Ollio that they should become robbers themselves. After an unsuccessful attempt to rob a woodchopper, the duo encounters Fra Diavolo, who orders Stanlio to hang Ollio for impersonating him. Diavolo is then informed that his men have stolen Lady Pamela's jewels but have not brought the 500,000 francs hidden by Rocburg. Diavolo, again disguised as the marquis, takes Stanlio and Ollio with him as his servants to an inn, where he plans to steal Rocburg's 500,000 francs, and where, as Marquis de San Marco, he again romances Lady Pamela. Stanlio and Ollio mistakenly capture Lord Rocburg, who has disguised himself as the marquis in an attempt to win back his wife. Diavolo's attempt to find the francs is, however, foiled after Stanlio drinks a sleeping potion meant for Rocburg. Diavolo's theft of Pamela's medallion is blamed on young Captain Lorenzo, the sweetheart of Zerlina, whose father, Matteo the innkeeper, has decreed that she is to marry a merchant named Francesco the next day. Lorenzo swears he will prove his innocence before Zerlina is forced to marry Francesco. Meanwhile, Diavolo romances Pamela once again and finds out that Rocburg's fortune is hidden in her petticoat. Just as Diavolo steals the petticoat, Lorenzo finds out his true identity from Stanlio, who is \\"spiffed\\" after a visit to Matteo's wine cellar. Lorenzo's soldiers surround the inn and he then duels with Diavolo, whom he bests with a little inadvertent help from Stanlio. The good-natured Diavolo returns the jewels, and when Rocburg will not pay the reward for them to Lorenzo, Diavolo gives Lorenzo the money that he stole from Pamela's petticoat. While the jealous husband rushes upstairs to confront his wife, Lorenzo gives the money to Matteo, thereby saving him from having to sell the inn. Diavolo, Stanlio, and Ollio are then taken away to be shot by a firing squad. When Stanlio takes out his red handkerchief in order to blow his nose, a bull becomes enraged and charges the group, allowing Diavolo to escape on his horse and Stanlio and Ollio to escape on the bull.

He first appeared in Berzerker #1 (February 1993), and was created by writer/artist Chris Ecker. In the fictional history of Big Bang Comics, his first appearance was in Deductive Comics. Fictional character biography Knight Watchman is based in Midway City (not to be confused with the city featured in Doom Patrol), where he fought crime for fifty years while maintaining a career as a fashion designer. Reid Randall's crimefighting life started after receiving a telegram saying that his brother, Ted, was in the hospital, leaving no one to run the family business, a garment factory. Back home, his mother told him that Ted had gambling debts, and the people he owed wanted to take the business. The beating Ted had received was a warning; next time the factory would be destroyed. Later that evening a hood tells Ted to sign over the business; Reid walks in and the hood runs out. Later Ted and Janet (Ted's wife) are killed by a car bomb. Reid swears to find the men responsible, make them pay, and rid the world of their kind.Big Bang Comics #5 (Vol.2) Top- Secret Origins Knight Watchman trained in ninjutsu with Hamato Yoshi. As time goes on, he becomes more of an anti-hero. By the time Big Bang Comics had entered the modern day (the 1990s), Knight Watchman is reluctant to come out of retirement despite attempts by Ultiman to place Randall back in the cape. Reid's nephew, Jerry Randall, becomes Knight Watchman's sidekick, Kid Galahad. As he grows up Jerry becomes a hero in his own right as Galahad (a reference to Dick Grayson's career as Robin and Nightwing). After Reid retires, Jerry fills both roles; as the publicly known and liked Galahad during the day, and as the mysterious and feared Knight Watchman at night. Reid later came out of retirement at the age of 55 when Jerry was hospitalized with a broken leg. Although in comics continuity, Knight Watchman exists in Earth-A (Silver Age), Knight Watchman appeared alongside the Earth-B Golden Age heroes in the TV movie Knights of Justice.

He left numerous sacred and secular works, almost all vocal, and was especially noted for his often-reprinted books of madrigals.  Life  Dragoni was born at Meldola, not far from Forl√¨, but details of his early life are lacking. He studied with Palestrina, as he indicated in the dedication to his first book of madrigals (1575). The next year he acquired the prestigious position of maestro di cappella at one of Rome's most prominent churches and musical establishments, St. John Lateran, and he retained this position for the rest of his life. In 1594, towards the end of his life, Cardinal del Monte appointed Dragoni to assess the progress on the revisions to liturgical chant, part of the extensive reforms following from the Council of Trent. Dragoni died in Rome.  Music  Dragoni's output was extensive, but much of his sacred music, kept in the St. John Lateran archive, has been lost, including a collection of settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (along with similar settings by Annibale Stabile), as well as a volume of settings of the Magnificat. He wrote at least six books of motets, of which five have been lost. He published seven books of madrigals, for four, five, and six voices, between 1575 and 1594. They were often reprinted, attesting to their popularity. Influences on Dragoni included his teacher Palestrina, especially early in his career, and later the renowned madrigalist Luca Marenzio. Dragoni's style emphasized clearly intelligible text setting, but by the 1590s his music shows an increasing emphasis on soprano and bass lines, as well as an understanding of motivic unity, both characteristics of the developing Baroque style. In addition he experimented with polychoral textures in some of his later works, a feature more prominent in Venetian than Roman music.

Directed by Kari Skogland, it is a thriller about a man seeking revenge for his daughter's death. Following its screening at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the film failed to get a proper theatrical release and was released straight to DVD on October 22, 2002. Plot Liberty Wallace (Linda Fiorentino) is the Vice President of Marketing for McCloud Industries, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the United States. She's the daughter of the company's founder, and married to the company's ruthless CEO, Victor Wallace (Oliver Platt). While Victor trafficks in international armaments, Liberty takes a break to have a romantic affair with Russell Williams (Martin Cummins), an actor. The balance of their marriage of convenience shifts when a sniper, Joe (Wesley Snipes), targets Liberty in a busy Los Angeles park on the way to her affair. Joe calls Liberty on her cell phone, ordering her to shackle herself to a nearby vendor‚Äôs hot dog cart. Liberty has no intention of acquiescing to Joe's wishes, until he begins shooting. Convinced, she locks herself to the stand, only to learn that it is loaded with explosives. If she calls for help, hangs up the phone, mutes the phone, or fails to co-operate, the bomb will go off. Joe has also armed a bomb against Russell, backstage in his dressing room at the nearby theater. Liberty realizes she can not buy her way out of the situation, and she is forced to consider Joe's demand for an anti-gun forum. It is revealed that Joe's daughter was fatally shot at school by a classmate, who used a gun manufactured by McCloud Industries. Joe has decided to show Liberty what it is like to be on the other end of the weapon, and the horrors of what she has had a blind hand in for years. Victor and Liberty have even bartered illegal deals that have resulted in easier access to weapons for street dealers, including the ones who sold the weapon that killed Joe's daughter. Joe wants Liberty to use her political connections and this incident to spark a public debate on the Second Amendment. Despite his past, Joe no longer supports the unequivocal right to bear arms. Joe tells Liberty that she is going to die, but that she can die as a hero if she exposes her company's shady business dealings and political connections before she's killed. As Joe monitors and records her every move, Liberty reveals secrets about her past, and business dealings. When Victor, who is also having an affair, finds out that Liberty has been taken hostage, he is torn between protecting himself and allowing Liberty to be killed, or going to help her. At first, it seems that Joe, who is actually a former CIA agent, is using Liberty as bait to attract media attention, but then Joe guns down news reporter Bill Tollman (Jonathan Scarfe), who is also the son of a hawkish U.S. Senator. Joe expresses his belief that this act will cause the Senator to change his pro-gun stance. Joe calls Victor on his cell phone as Victor is finally acting on his choice to get out of town. While Joe is shaming Victor for leaving his wife to die, Victor suddenly recognizes the voice on the phone as someone he knows personally. Following the phone conversation, Victor orders his car to bring him to where his wife is. When Victor finally arrives on the scene, Joe calls him on his cell phone again, and Victor addresses Joe by the name Alex. They discuss the time they met in Colombia and how Alex had saved Victor‚Äôs life there. Victor also apologizes for having won a military medal under false pretenses for whatever transpired while they were in Colombia. Joe/Alex then shoots and kills Victor in front of Liberty. Alex then tells Liberty that it is all up to her now before informing her that a key to her shackles is hidden in a box, underneath the hot dog cart. Liberty retrieves the key and releases herself, and then she runs to Russell's dressing room. Together, they helplessly watch the timer on his bomb count down to zero. When the bomb does not explode, they realize that it was a fake. Meanwhile, a police SWAT team has figured out which building Joe is hiding in. Before they can get to Joe/Alex he shoots himself under the chin, and dies; but he has already forwarded Liberty's recorded confessions to several newspapers. Music The techno score was produced and composed by Convertino, and orchestrated with sound design by Film Composer and Film Music Producer Robert Muzingo. Release The film premiered at the Palm Springs International Film Festival on January 18, 2002, originally planned to have a worldwide theatrical release, but due to the film's critical reception, it was released direct-to-video in 2002. Reception =Critical response= The film has received mostly negative reviews; critics praised Snipes and Fiorentino's performances, but panned the overall premise. The film was panned by gun-rights supporters as being very anti-gun and portraying all firearm owners in a negative light. Many noted the film's similarities to Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth, another film released around the same time.

The sides were characterized by anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, including pornography, erotica, prostitution, lesbian sexual practices, the role of transgender women in the lesbian community, sadomasochism and other sexual issues. The feminist movement was deeply divided as a result of these debates. Many historians view the feminist sex wars as having been the end of the second-wave feminist era (which began 1963) as well as the herald of the third wave (which began in the early 1990s).As noted in:  * *  Two opposing views  The two sides became labelled anti-pornography feminists and sex- positive feminists. = Anti-pornography feminists = In 1976 Andrea Dworkin organized demonstrations against the film Snuff in New York, but attempts to start an organization to continue the feminist anti-pornography campaign failed. Efforts were more successful in Los Angeles, where Women Against Violence Against Women was founded in response to Snuff in 1976; they campaigned against the Rolling Stones' 1976 album Black and Blue. The U.S. anti-pornography movement gained ground with the founding of Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media (WAVPM) in 1977 in San Francisco, following a 1976 conference on violence against women held by local women's centers. Early members included Susan Griffin, Kathleen Barry, and Laura Lederer. WAVPM organised the first national conference on pornography in San Francisco in 1978 which included the first Take Back the Night march. The conference led to anti-pornography feminists organizing in New York in 1979 under the banner of Women Against Pornography (WAP), and to similar organizations and efforts being created across the United States. In 1983, Page Mellish, a one-time member of WAVPM and of WAP, founded Feminists Fighting Pornography to focus on political activism seeking legal changes to limit the porn industry. Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon wanted civil laws restricting pornography and to this end drafted the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance, also known as the Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance. = Sex-positive feminists = The term pro- sex feminism and, later, sex-positive feminism were inspired by Ellen Willis. From 1979 feminist journalist Ellen Willis was one of the early voices criticizing anti-pornography feminists for what she saw as sexual puritanism, moral authoritarianism and a threat to free speech. Her 1981 essay, Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex? is the origin of the term, \\"pro-sex feminism\\".Ellen Willis, Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement, Village Voice 50th Anniversary Issue, 2007. This is not the original \\"Lust Horizons\\" essay, but a retrospective essay mentioning that essay as the origin of the term. Accessed online 7 July 2007. A lightly revised version of the original \\"Lust Horizons\\" essay can be found in No More Nice Girls, pp. 3‚Äì14. The response to the anti-pornography strand of feminism by the sex-positive feminists was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women, seeing anti-pornography positions as aligned to the political right-wing's war on recreational sex and pornography. Early sex positive groups included Samois, founded in San Francisco in 1978, whose early members included Gayle Rubin and Pat Califia, and the Lesbian Sex Mafia, founded by Dorothy Allison and Jo Arnone in New York in 1981. The Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce (FACT) was set up in 1984 by Ellen Willis in response to the Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance, in 1989 Feminists Against Censorship formed in the UK, its members including Avedon Carol and Feminists for Free Expression formed in the United States in 1992 by Marcia Pally, with founding members including Nadine Strossen, Joan Kennedy Taylor, Veronica Vera and Candida Royalle.  Key events  In October 1980 the National Organization for Women identified what became known as the \\"Big Four\\" through declaring that \\"Pederasty, pornography, sadomasochism and public sex\\" were about \\"exploitation, violence or invasion of privacy\\" and not \\"sexual preference or orientation\\". One of the more memorable clashes between the pro-sex and anti-porn feminists occurred at the 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events‚Äô planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.  Debates  The two sides of the feminist sex wars clashed over a number of issues, resulting in intense debates held both in person and in various media. = Pornography debate = Toward the end of the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement shifted from the discussion of lesbian feminism to focus on the new topic of sexuality. One of the primary concerns with sexuality was the issue of pornography, which caused a great divide among feminists. The two recognized sides of the debate were anti-pornography feminism and \\"pro-sex\\" feminism. One of the major influences of anti- pornography feminism was its predecessor, lesbian feminism. Anti-pornography movements developed from fundamental arguments displayed by lesbianism, such as the notion of patriarchal sexual relations. Ellen Willis described these relations as being \\"based on male power backed by force.\\" From this perspective, pornography is created exclusively for men by men and is a direct reflection of the man-dominant paradigm surrounding sexual relations. Another idea taken from lesbian feminism by anti-pornography groups was that sexuality is about creating a compassionate bond and a lasting relation with another person, contrary to the belief of the purely physical nature of sex. In her book, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, Andrea Dworkin argued that the theme of pornography is male dominance and as a result it is intrinsically harmful to women and their well-being. Dworkin believed that pornography is not only damaging in its production but also in its consumption, since the viewer will mentally internalize pornography's misogynistic portrayal of women. Robin Morgan summarized the view of anti-pornography feminists that pornography and violence against women are linked in her statement, \\"pornography is the theory, rape is the practice\\". The anti-pornography movement has been criticised by sex-positive feminists as a repression of sexuality and a move towards censorship. In her article, Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality, Gayle Rubin characterizes sex liberation as a feminist goal and denounces the idea that anti-pornography feminists speak collectively for all of feminism. She offers the notion that what is needed is a theory of sexuality separate from feminism. In XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography, Wendy McElroy summarizes the sex-positive perspective as \\"the benefits pornography provides to women far outweigh any of its disadvantages\\". The pornography debate among radical and libertarian feminists has focused on the depictions of female sexuality in relation to male sexuality in this type of media.Ferguson, A. 1984. \\"Sex War: The Debate between Radical and Libertarian Feminists.\\" Chicago Journals. 10 (1): 106‚Äì112. Radical feminists emphasize that pornography illustrates objectification and normalization of sexual violence through presentation of specific acts. In contrast, libertarian feminists are concerned with the stigmatization of sexual minorities and the limited right to practice sexual choice that would be hindered without pornography. = Sadomasochism debate = The main focus of the sex wars' debate on sadomasochism and other BDSM practices was San Francisco. Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media was founded there in 1977. Its first political action was to picket a live show at a strip club featuring women performing sadomasochistic acts on each other, in line with its stated aim to end all portrayals of women being \\"bound, raped, tortured, killed or degraded for sexual stimulation or pleasure\\". As well as campaigning against pornography, WAVPM were also strongly opposed to BDSM, seeing it as ritualized violence against women and opposed its practice within the lesbian community. In 1978 SAMOIS was formed, an organization for women in the BDSM community who saw their sexual practices as consistent with feminist principles. Several black lesbian feminists have written on this topic, including Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Darlene Pagano, Karen Sims, and Rose Mason, condemning sadomasochism as an often racist practice, insensitive to the black female experience. = Prostitution debate = Another debate of the feminist sex wars centered on prostitution. The women in the anti- pornography camp argued against prostitution, claiming it is forced on women who have no alternatives. Meanwhile, sex-positive feminists argued that this position ignored the agency of women who chose sex work, viewing prostitution as not inherently based on the exploitation of women. Carol Leigh notes that \\"The Prostitutes rights movement of the early 1970s evolved directly from the women's movement\\", but adds: \\"The women's movement in the U.S. has always been ambivalent about prostitutes\\".  Effects  The polarization of feminist ideology during the sex wars has had wide-ranging effects. Examples include, according to Liu (2011), \\"The confusion in the interpretation of the definition of human trafficking is a consequence of opposing feminist views on prostitution.\\" Preview.  Third-wave feminists' views  Third-wave feminist writings promote personal, individualized views on the gender-related issues focused on during the feminist sex wars, such as prostitution, pornography and sadomasochism. In particular, the third-wave view of pornography is that there is no greater meaning other than which the actor or consumer gives it. Items such as sex objects and porn, identified by some second-wave feminists as instruments of oppression are now no longer being exclusively used by men but also by women. Feminist critic Teresa de Lauretis sees the sex wars not in terms of polarized sides but as reflecting a third wave feminism inherently embodying difference, which may include conflicting and competing drives. Meanwhile, critic Jana Sawicki rejects both the polarized positions, seeking a third way that is neither morally dogmatic or uncritically libertarian.

The Byzantines and Bulgarians continued to clash over the next century with variable success, until the Bulgarians, led by Krum, inflicted a series of crushing defeats on the Byzantines. After Krum died in 814, his son Omurtag negotiated a thirty-year peace treaty. In 893, during the next major war, Simeon I, the Bulgarian emperor, defeated the Byzantines while attempting to form a large Eastern European Empire, but his efforts failed. In 971 John I Tzimiskes, the Byzantine emperor, subjugated much of the weakening Bulgarian Empire, facing wars with Russians, Pechenegs, Magyars and Croatians and by defeating Boris II and capturing Preslav, the Bulgarian capital. Constantinople under Basil II completely conquered Bulgaria in 1018 as a result of the 1014 Battle of Kleidion. There were rebellions against Byzantine rule from 1040 to 1041, and in the 1070s and the 1080s, but these failed. In 1185, however, Theodore Peter and Ivan Asen started a revolt, and the weakening Byzantine Empire, facing internal dynastic troubles of its own, was unable to prevent the revolt from being successful. After the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople in 1204, Kaloyan, the Bulgarian emperor, tried to establish friendly relations with the crusaders, but the newly created Latin Empire spurned any offer of alliance with the Bulgarians. Because of his cold reception, Kaloyan allied with the Nicaeans, one of the Byzantine states created after the fall of Constantinople, instead, which reduced the crusaders' power in the area. Even though his nephew Boril allied with the Latin Empire, Boril's successors sided with the Nicaeans, despite a few continuing attacks from them. After the Latin Empire collapsed, the Byzantines, taking advantage of a Bulgarian civil war, captured portions of Thrace, but the Bulgarian emperor Theodore Svetoslav retook these lands. The Byzantine-Bulgarian relations continued to fluctuate until the Ottoman Turks captured the Bulgarian capital in 1393 and the Byzantine capital in 1453. Asparukh's war The Byzantines and the Bulgarians first clashed when Khan Kubrat's youngest son Asparukh moved westward, occupying today's southern Bessarabia. Asparukh defeated the Byzantines under Constantine IV, who led a combined land and sea operation against the invaders and besieged their fortified camp in Ongala. Suffering from bad health, the emperor had to leave the army, which allowed itself to panic and be defeated by the Bulgarians. In 681 Constantine was forced to acknowledge the Bulgar state in Moesia and to pay protection money to avoid further inroads into Byzantine Thrace.Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, pp. 357‚Äì360 Eight years later, Asparukh led a successful campaign against Byzantine Thrace. Tervel's wars Tervel, first mentioned in the Byzantine texts in 704 when the deposed emperor Justinian II came to him and asked for his aid, supported Justinian in an attempted restoration to the Byzantine throne in exchange for friendship, gifts and his daughter in marriage. With an army of 15,000 horsemen provided by Tervel, Justinian suddenly advanced on Constantinople and managed to gain entrance into the city in 705. The restored emperor executed his supplanters, the emperors Leontios and Tiberios III, alongside many of their supporters. Justinian rewarded Tervel with many gifts, the title of kaisar (Caesar), which made him second only to the emperor and the first foreign ruler in Byzantine history to receive such a title, and possibly a territorial concession in northeastern Thrace, a region called Zagore. Whether Justinian's daughter Anastasia was married to Tervel as had been arranged is unknown. A mere three years later Justinian II himself violated this arrangement and apparently commenced military operations to recover the ceded area. Tervel routed him at the Battle of Anchialus (or Ankhialo) in 708. In 711, faced by a serious revolt in Asia Minor, Justinian again sought the aid of Tervel but obtained only lukewarm support manifested in an army of 3,000. Outmaneuvered by the rebel emperor Philippicus, Justinian was captured and executed, while his Bulgar allies were allowed to retire to their country. Tervel took advantage of the disorder in Byzantium to raid Thrace in 712, plundering as far as the vicinity of Constantinople. According to the chronological information of the Imennik, Tervel died in 715. However, the Byzantine Chronicler Theophanes the Confessor ascribes Tervel a role in an attempt to restore the deposed Emperor Anastasius II in 718 or 719. If Tervel did survive this long, he was the Bulgarian ruler who concluded a new treaty with Emperor Theodosius III in 716 (confirming the annual tribute paid by the Byzantines to Bulgaria and the territorial concessions in Thrace, as well as regulating commercial relations and the treatment of political refugees), and he was also the Bulgarian ruler who helped relieve the second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717-718 by land. According to Theophanes, the Bulgars slaughtered some 22,000 Arabs in the battle.  Constantine V's wars  Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Wars (741‚Äì775) After the death of Sevar, Bulgaria descended into a long period of crisis and unrest, while the Byzantines consolidated their positions. Between 756 and 775, the new Byzantine Emperor Constantine V led nine campaigns against his northern neighbour to establish a Byzantine border on the Danube.Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, p.429 Due to the frequent change of rulers (eight Khans held the throne in twenty years) and the constant political crisis, Bulgaria was on the verge of destruction. In his first campaign in 756, Constantine V was successful and managed to defeat the Bulgarians twice, but in 759, Vinekh, the Bulgarian Khan, defeated the Byzantine army comprehensively in the Battle of the Rishki Pass.Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, p.431 Vinekh then sought to make peace with the Byzantines but was assassinated by Bulgarian nobles. The new ruler, Telets, was defeated at the Battle of Anchialus in 763.Nicephorus. Opuscula historica, pp. 69‚Äì70 During their next campaigns, both sides failed to gain significant success because the Byzantines could not pass through the Balkan Mountains, and their fleet was destroyed twice in heavy storms (2,600 ships sank in just one of the storms in 765Nicephorus. Opuscula historica, p. 73Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, p. 437). In 774, they defeated an inferior Bulgarian force at Berzitia, but this was the last success of Constantine V: as a result of their defeat, the Bulgarians took serious precautions to get rid of the Byzantine spies in Pliska. Khan Telerig sent a secret emissary to Constantine V indicating his intention to flee Bulgaria and seek refuge with the emperor, and seeking assurances of hospitality. Telerig succeeded in having the emperor betray his own agents in Bulgaria, who were duly rounded up and executed. The expected Byzantine retaliation failed to materialize as Constantine V died in 775.  Constantine VI's failed retaliations  In 791, the Byzantine emperor Constantine VI embarked on an expedition against Bulgaria, in retaliation for Bulgarian incursions in the Struma valley since 789. Kardam pre-empted the Byzantine invasion and met the enemy near Adrianople in Thrace. The Byzantine army was defeated and turned to flight. In 792, Constantine VI led another army against the Bulgarians and encamped at Marcellae, near Karnobat, which he proceeded to fortify. Kardam arrived with his army on July 20 and occupied the neighboring heights. After some time passed with the two forces sizing up each other, Constantine VI ordered the attack, but in the resulting Battle of Marcellae the Byzantine forces lost formation and once again were defeated and turned to flight. Kardam captured the imperial tent and the emperor's servants. After his return to Constantinople, Constantine VI signed a peace treaty and undertook to pay an annual tribute to Bulgaria. By 796, the imperial government was recalcitrant and Kardam found it necessary to demand the tribute while threatening to devastate Thrace if it were not paid. According to the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, Constantine VI mocked the demand by having dung sent instead of gold as \\"fitting tribute\\" and promising to lead a new army against the elderly Kardam at Marcellae. Once again the emperor's army headed north, and once again it encountered Kardam in the vicinity of Adrianople. The armies faced each other for 17 days without entering into battle, while the two monarchs probably engaged in negotiations. In the end, conflict was averted and the peace resumed on the same terms as in 792. Khan Krum's wars Menologium. Bulgarian pagans killing the Christians Khan Krum engaged in an aggressive policy within the Balkans, raiding along the Struma valley in 807, where he defeated a Byzantine army and captured an enormous amount of gold intended as wages for the whole Byzantine army.Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, pp. 484‚Äì486 In 809, Krum besieged and forced the surrender of Serdica (Sofia), slaughtering the Byzantine garrison in spite of his promise of safe conduct. This provoked Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros I to settle Anatolian populations along the frontier to protect it and to attempt to retake and refortify Serdica, although this enterprise ultimately failed. =Conflict with Nikephoros I= In early 811, Nikephoros I undertook a massive expedition against Bulgaria, advancing to Marcellae (near Karnobat). Here Krum attempted to negotiate on July 11, 811, but Nikephoros was determined to continue his advance. His army managed to avoid Bulgarian ambushes in the Balkan Mountains and defeated an army of 12,000 that tried to block their advance into Moesia. Another hastily assembled army of 50,000 was defeated before the walls of the Bulgarian capital, Pliska,Anonymus Vaticanus, pp. 148‚Äì149 which fell to the emperor on July 20. Here Nikephoros, who had been a financial minister before becoming emperor, helped himself to the treasures of Krum, while setting the city afire and turning his army on the population. A new diplomatic tentative from Krum was rebuffed. Nikephorus showed great cruelty, ordering his army to kill the population of the capital.Chronique de Michel de Syrien, p.17 Increasingly concerned about the breakdown of discipline in his army, Nikephoros finally began to retreat towards Thrace. In the meantime, Krum had mobilized as many of his subjects as he could (including the women) and had begun to set traps and ambushes for the retreating imperial army in the mountain passes. At dawn on July 26 the Byzantines found themselves trapped against a moat and wooden wall in the VƒÉrbica pass.Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, pp. 489‚Äì492 Nikephoros was killed in the ensuing battle along with many of his troops, while his son Staurakios was carried to safety by the imperial bodyguard after receiving a paralyzing wound to his neck. According to tradition, Krum had the Emperor's skull lined with silver and used it as a drinking cup. This enhanced his reputation for brutality and won him the appellation of \\"New Sennacherib\\". =Conflict with Michael I Rangabe= Krum assembles his army to defeat the Byzantines Staurakios was forced to abdicate after a brief reign (he died from his wound in 812) and was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Michael I Rangabe. In 812 Krum invaded Byzantine Thrace, taking Develt and scaring the population of nearby fortresses to flee towards Constantinople. From this position of strength, Krum offered a return to the peace treaty of 716. Unwilling to compromise his regime by weakness, the new Emperor Michael I refused to accept the proposal, ostensibly opposing the clause for exchange of deserters. To apply more pressure on the emperor, Krum besieged and captured Mesembria (Nesebar) in the fall of 812. In February 813, the Bulgarians raided into Thrace but were repelled by the emperor's forces. Encouraged by this success, Michael I summoned troops from the entire empire and headed north, hoping for a decisive victory. Krum led his army south towards Adrianople and pitched camp near Versinikia. Michael I lined up his army against the Bulgarians, but neither side initiated an attack for two weeks. Finally, on June 22, 813, the Byzantines attacked but were immediately turned to flight.Scriptor Incertus. Historia. pp. 337‚Äì339 With Krum's cavalry in pursuit, the rout of Michael I was complete, and Krum advanced on Constantinople, which he besieged by land. Discredited, Michael was forced to abdicate and become a monk ‚Äî the third Byzantine emperor undone by Krum in as many years. =Conflict with Leo V the Armenian= The new emperor, Leo V the Armenian, offered to negotiate and arranged for a meeting with Krum. As Krum arrived, he was ambushed by Byzantine archers and was wounded as he made his escape. Furious, Krum ravaged the environs of Constantinople and headed home, capturing AdrianopleGeorgius Monachus. Chronicon, col.981 en route and transplanting its inhabitants (including the parents of the future Emperor Basil I) across the Danube. In spite of the approach of winter, Krum took advantage of good weather to send a force of 30,000 into Thrace, capturing Arkadioupolis (L√ºleburgaz) and carrying off some 50,000 captives. The loot from Thrace was used to enrich Krum and his nobility and included architectural elements utilized in the reconstruction of Pliska, perhaps largely by captured Byzantine artisans. Krum spent the winter preparing for a major attack on Constantinople, where rumor reported the assemblage of an extensive siege park to be transported on 5,000 carts. He died before he set out, however, on April 13, 814, and was succeeded by his son Omurtag. =Omurtag's peace treaty= Omurtag sends delegation to the Byzantines The reign of Khan Omurtag opened with an invasion of the Byzantine Empire after the rejection of Byzantine offers for peace. The Bulgarians penetrated as far south as modern Babaeski (Bulgarophygon then), but there they were defeated by Emperor Leo V the Armenian, and Omurtag escaped the battlefield on his swift horse. The battle was not a decisive blow for the Bulgarians, though it certainly had some effect. The possibility of an anti- Bulgarian alliance between the Byzantine and the Frankish empires, the need to consolidate Bulgarian authority in the newly conquered lands, and the new stirring of the tribes in the steppes gave reason for Omurtag to conclude a 30-year peace treaty with the Byzantines in 815, which was partly inscribed on a surviving column found near the village of Seltsi, Shumen Province. According to that inscription the treaty specified the border in Thrace, the issue with those Slavs who remained in Byzantium, and the exchange of the other prisoners of war. The treaty was honoured by both sides and was renewed after the accession of the new Byzantine Emperor Michael II to the throne in 820. In 821 Thomas the Slav rebelled against the Byzantine Emperor and laid siege to Constantinople, seeking to seize the imperial throne for himself. Khan Omurtag sent an army to help Michael II put down the rebellion, attacking the rebels at the Battle of Kedouktos (winter 822 or spring 823). Although Byzantine accounts report that Thomas's army was routed, modern scholars consider the battle a victory, albeit costly, for Thomas. Brief war with Theophilos After the expiration of the original 20-year peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire in 836, Emperor Theophilos ravaged the regions within the Bulgarian frontier. The Bulgarians retaliated, and under the leadership of Isbul, the minister of Malamir, they reached Adrianople. At this time, if not earlier, the Bulgarians annexed Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and its environs. Several surviving monumental inscriptions from this reign make reference to the Bulgarian victories and others to the continuation of construction activities in and near Pliska. The war ended, however, when Slavs in the vicinity of Thessalonica rebelled against the Byzantine Empire in 837. Emperor Theophilos sought Bulgarian support in putting down the rebellion, but he simultaneously arranged for his fleet to sail through the Danube delta and undertake a clandestine evacuation of some of the Byzantine captives settled in trans-Danubian Bulgaria by Krum and Omurtag. In retaliation Isbul campaigned along the Aegean coasts of Thrace and Macedonia and captured the city of Philippi, where Theophilos set up a surviving memorial inscription in a local church. Isbul's campaign may have resulted in the establishment of Bulgarian suzerainty over the Slavic tribe of the Smoljani. Wars of Boris I Despite his able diplomacy, statesmanship, and his importance in the process of converting Bulgaria to Christianity, Boris I was not a particularly successful leader in war, being at various times defeated by the Franks, Croats, Serbs, and Byzantines. =War of 852= Soon after coming to power Boris launched a brief campaign against the Byzantines in 852. No details of the outcome of this war are extant, though it is possible he may have gained some territory in inland Macedonia.. =War of 855‚Äì856= Another conflict between the Byzantines and Bulgarians started in 855‚Äì856. The Empire wanted to regain its control over some areas of inland Thrace and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. The Byzantine forces, led by the emperor and the caesar Bardas, were successful in the conflict and reconquered a number of cities, Philippopolis, Develtus, Anchialus and Mesembria being among them, and also the frontier region between Sider and Develtus, known as Zagora, in northeastern Thrace..Bulgarian historical review, v. 33:no. 1‚Äì4, p. 9. At the time of this campaign the Bulgarians were distracted by a war with the Franks under Louis the German and the Croatians. =Military conflict connected to the Christian conversion of Boris= In 863 Boris made a decision to embrace Christianity, and he sought a mission from the Franks. The Byzantines could not countenance so close a neighbor as Bulgaria falling under Frankish religious control. Byzantium had recently gained a major victory over the Arabs and was free to field a considerable military force against Bulgaria. A fleet was sent into the Black Sea and an army dispatched to invade Bulgaria. As the bulk of Boris' army was campaigning against Moravia far to the northwest, he had little choice but to yield immediately. He broke off the Frankish alliance, allowed Greek clergy to enter Bulgaria, and was eventually baptized, with the Byzantine emperor Michael III as his sponsor; Boris took the additional name of Michael at his baptism. The Bulgarians were allowed to recover the debatable region of Zagora as a reward for their change of religious orientation.. Simeon I's Imperial ambitions Bulgarophygon in 896 With the ascendance of Simeon I to the throne in 893, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, acting under pressure from his wife Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father, Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh. The war ended in 896 with a great Bulgarian victory near Bulgarophygon in Eastern Thrace. The market was returned to Constantinople, and the Byzantine Emperor had to pay annual tribute to Bulgaria. More importantly, with help from the Pechenegs Simeon successfully fended off a Magyar invasion, which was coordinated with the Byzantines. Battle of Achelous or Anchialos. After the death of Leo VI on 11 May 912 and the accession of his infant son Constantine VII, under the guidance of Leo's brother Alexander, who expelled Leo's last wife and Constantine's mother, Zoe Karbonopsina, from the palace, Simeon claimed the imperial title and tried to replace Byzantium as the biggest power in the region, perhaps building a new Bulgarian‚ÄìByzantine empire. Alexander died on 6 June 913, leaving the capital in anarchy and the rule of the empire in the hands of a regency council headed by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos. This gave the Bulgarian ruler a great opportunity to attempt a campaign towards the Byzantine capital, so he attacked in full force in late July or August 913, reaching Constantinople without any serious resistance. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears in the Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor (tzar) of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernai Palace. Until the end of his reign, Simeon used the style of \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans\\". Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe returned to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters. In retaliation, Simeon invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured Adrianople. In 917, a particularly strong Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas, son of Nikephoros Phokas, invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of Romanos Lekapenos, which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. En route to Mesembria (Neseb«ér), where they were supposed to be reinforced by troops transported by the navy, Phokas' forces stopped to rest near the river of Acheloos, not far from the port of Anchialos (Pomorie). Once informed of the invasion, Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines, and he attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized. In the Battle of Achelous (or Anchialus) on 20 August 917, one of the largest in medieval history, the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders, although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria. As a result of the victory Simeon drew into his orbit the Pecheneg leaders and started a major offensive against the European dominions of Byzantium. The Bulgarians sent to pursue the remnants of the Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas, who had returned to the capital, at the village of Katasyrtai in the immediate proximity of Constantinople.Runciman, pp. 53‚Äì56 The Bulgarian victory at Anchialos Simeon pursued an aggressive policy regarding the Medieval Serbian principalities that tended to support Byzantium. Bulgarian troops led by Theodore Sigritsa and Marmais invaded the country, deposing local rulers like Petar Gojnikoviƒá and Pavle Branoviƒá. Meanwhile, the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919 and advanced himself to the rank of co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming control of the empire. No longer able to climb to the Byzantine throne by diplomatic means, the infuriated Simeon once again had to wage war to impose his will. Between 920 and 922, Bulgaria increased its pressure on Byzantium, campaigning in the west through Thessaly, reaching the Isthmus of Corinth, and in the east in Thrace, reaching and crossing the Dardanelles to lay siege on the town of Lampsacus. Simeon's forces appeared before Constantinople in 921, when they demanded the deposition of Romanos and captured Adrianople; in 922 they were victorious at Pigae, burning much of the Golden Horn and seizing Bizye.Runciman, pp. 85‚Äì89 Simeon sending envoys to the Fatimid ruler Ubayd Allah. Madrid Skylitzes. Desperate to conquer Constantinople, Simeon planned a large campaign in 924 and sent envoys to the Shia Fatimid ruler Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah, who possessed a powerful navy, which Simeon needed. The Ubayd Allah agreed and sent his own representatives back with the Bulgarians to arrange the alliance. However, the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at Calabria. Romanos offered peace to Egypt under the Fatimids, supplementing this offer with generous gifts, and ruined the Fatimids newly formed alliance with Bulgaria. In 924 Simeon sent an army led by ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá to depose a former ally of his, Zaharije Pribisavljeviƒá. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. In the summer of the same year, Simeon arrived at Constantinople and demanded to see the patriarch and the emperor. He conversed with Romanos on the Golden Horn on 9 September 924 and arranged a truce, according to which Byzantium would pay Bulgaria an annual tax, but would be ceded back some cities on the Black Sea coast. In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, at the time a Byzantine ally, but were severely defeated by the army of King Tomislav in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. A peace was mediated by the papal legate Madalbert between Simeon and Tomislav. Though the army he sent to Croatia was destroyed, Simeon retained sufficient military forces to contemplate renewed aggression against the Byzantines.Runciman, pp. 90‚Äì96Fine, pp. 157 After 14 years of war Simeon was ultimately too frustrated in his designs on the Byzantine throne. In the year following the destruction of his army in Croatia, while planning another attack on the Byzantines, he died of a heart attack in his palace in Preslav on May 27, 927.Runciman, p. 96 Peter's relations with the Byzantines Soon after his accession, Simeon's son Peter I renewed the war and raided Byzantine Thrace. Following this show of strength, Peter dispatched a diplomatic mission to Constantinople seeking peace. A peace was obtained with the frontiers restored to those defined in treaties of 897 and 904. Simeon's conquests in Thrace were restored to the Byzantine Empire, which in return recognised Bulgarian control over inland Macedonia. Peter also gained a Byzantine bride, Maria Lecapena, granddaughter of Romanus I, an annual tribute, and recognition of his title of tsar and of the autocephalus status of the Bulgarian church. This peace lasted until 966.. After Peter's empress died in the mid 960s, the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to pay the annual tribute to Bulgaria in 966, complaining of the Bulgarian alliance with the Magyars, and undertook a show of force at the Bulgarian border. Dissuaded from a direct attack against Bulgaria, Nikephoros II dispatched a messenger to the Kievan prince Sviatoslav Igorevich to arrange a Kievan attack against Bulgaria from the north. Sviatoslav readily launched a campaign with a vast force and routed the Bulgarians on the Danube, seizing some 80 Bulgarian fortresses in 968. Stunned by the success of his ally and suspicious of his actual intentions, Emperor Nikephoros II now hastened to make peace with Bulgaria and arranged the marriage of his wards, the underage emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII, to two Bulgarian princesses. Two of Peter's sons were sent to Constantinople as both negotiators and honorary hostages. In the meantime, Peter managed to secure the retreat of the Kievan forces by inciting Bulgaria's traditional allies, the Pechenegs, to attack Kiev itself. Sviatoslav's invasion and the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria The Byzantines sack the Bulgarian capital Preslav In 968 Boris II, future emperor of Bulgaria, went to Constantinople again to negotiate a peace settlement with Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, and apparently to serve as an honorary hostage. This arrangement was intended to put an end to the conflict between Bulgaria and Byzantium, which would now join forces against Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev, whom the Byzantine emperor had pitted against the Bulgarians. In 969 a new Kievan invasion defeated the Bulgarians again, and Peter I abdicated to become a monk. In circumstances that are not entirely clear, Boris II was allowed to return to Bulgaria and sit on his father's throne. Boris II was unable to stem the Kievan advance and found himself forced to accept Sviatoslav of Kiev as his ally and puppet-master, turning against the Byzantines. A Kievan campaign into Byzantine Thrace was defeated at Arcadiopolis in 970, and the new Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes advanced northwards. Failing to secure the defense of the Balkan passes, Sviatoslav allowed the Byzantines to penetrate into Moesia and lay siege to the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Although Bulgarians and Russians joined in defending the city, the Byzantines managed to set afire the wooden structures and roofs with missiles, and they took the fortress. Boris II now became a captive of John I Tzimiskes, who continued to pursue the Russians, besieging Sviatoslav in DrƒÉstƒÉr (Silistra) while claiming to act as Boris' ally and protector and treating the Bulgarian monarch with due respect. After Sviatoslav had come to terms and set out for Kiev, the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople in triumph. Far from liberating Bulgaria as he had claimed, John brought along Boris II and his family, together with the contents of the Bulgarian imperial treasury in 971. In a public ceremony in Constantinople, Boris II was ritually divested of his imperial insignia and was given the Byzantine court title of magistros as compensation. The Bulgarian lands in Thrace and lower Moesia now became part of the Byzantine Empire and were placed under Byzantine governors. =Tsar Samuel and the conquest of Bulgaria by Basil II= The victory of the Byzantines over the Bulgarians, from the late 11th century Madrid Skylitzes. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria. These remained under the rule of their own governors, especially a noble family led by four brothers called the Cometopuli (i.e., \\"the sons of the Count\\"), named David, Moses, Aron, and Samuel. The movement was regarded as a \\"revolt\\" by the Byzantine emperor, but it apparently saw itself as a sort of regency for the captive Boris II. As they began to raid neighboring territories under Byzantine rule, the Byzantine government resorted to a stratagem intended to compromise the leadership of this \\"revolt\\". This involved allowing Boris II and his brother Roman to escape from their honorary captivity at the Byzantine court, in the hope that their arrival in Bulgaria would cause a division between the Cometopuli and other Bulgarian leaders. As the brothers entered the region under Bulgarian control in 977, Boris II dismounted and went ahead of his brother. Mistaken for a Byzantine noble due to his attire, Boris was shot in the chest by a deaf and mute border patrol. Roman managed to identify himself to the other guards and was duly accepted as emperor. However, since he was a eunuch, as the Byzantines had castrated him so that he could not have any heirs, he was unable to assume the throne. Instead, the youngest of the Cometopuli brothers, Samuel, resisted the Byzantines. Edessa and killing its governor Although the Byzantines eventually managed to capture all of Bulgaria, Samuel resisted Basil II for decades and is the only man to ever defeat him in battle, when in 986 Samuel drove Basil II's army from the field at the Gates of Trajan, and the emperor (barely surviving the heavy defeat) soon turned to the east for new conquests. The victory by Samuel prompted Pope Gregory V to recognize him as Tsar, and he was crowned in Rome in 997. In 1002, a full-scale war broke out. By this time, Basil's army was stronger, and the emperor was determined to conquer Bulgaria once and for all. He deployed much of the imperial army, battle-seasoned from the Eastern campaigns against the Arabs, and Samuel was forced to retreat into his country's heartland. Still, by harassing the powerful Byzantine army, Samuel hoped to force Basil to the peace table. For a dozen years, his tactics maintained Bulgarian independence and even kept Basil away from the main Bulgarian cities, including the capital of Ohrid. On July 29, 1014, however, at Kleidion (or Belasitsa) (present day Blagoevgrad Province), Basil II was able to corner the main Bulgarian army and force a battle while Samuel was away. He won a crushing victory and, according to later legend,Catherine Holmes, the Governance of Basil II he blinded 14,000 prisoners, leaving one man in every hundred with sight in one eye to lead his comrades home. According to the legend, the sight of this atrocity was too much even for Samuel, who blamed himself for the defeat and died less than three months later, on October 6. This story is a later invention, which gave rise to the nickname by which Basil II was known from the 12th century onwards: the 'Bulgar-slayer'. =Ivan Vladislav= The Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Vladislav restored the fortifications of Bitola in 1015 and survived an assassination plot undertaken by Byzantine agents. Although the Byzantines sacked Ohrid, they failed to take Pernik and received troubling intelligence that Ivan Vladislav was attempting to induce the Pechenegs to come to his aid, following up the general practice of his predecessors. While Byzantine armies had penetrated deep into Bulgaria in 1016, Ivan Vladislav was able to rally his forces and commenced a siege of Dyrrachium (Durazzo) in the winter of 1018. During a battle in front of the city, Ivan Vladislav was killed. After his death much of the Bulgarian nobility and court, including his widow Maria and his sons, submitted to the advancing Basil II in exchange for guarantees of the preservation of their lives, status, and property. Peter II The Bulgarians proclaim Peter Delyan emperor The newly proclaimed Bulgarian emperor Peter II later led a large revolt against the Byzantines. Peter II Delyan took Ni≈° and Skopje, first co-opting and then eliminating another potential leader in the person of one Tihomir, who had led a rebellion in the region of Durazzo. After this Peter II marched on Thessalonica, where the Byzantine Emperor Michael IV was staying. Michael fled, leaving his treasury to a certain Michael Ivac, probably a son of Ivac, a general under Samuel of Bulgaria, who promptly turned over the bulk of the treasury to Peter outside the city. Thessalonica remained in Byzantine hands, but Macedonia, Durazzo, and parts of northern Greece were taken by Peter II's forces. This inspired further Slavic revolts against Byzantine rule in Epirus and Albania. Peter II Delyan's successes ended, however, with the interference of his cousin Alusian, whose father, Ivan Vladislav, had murdered Peter's father, Gavril Radomir, in 1015. Alusian joined Peter II's ranks as an apparent deserter from the Byzantine court, where he had been disgraced, and was welcomed by Peter II, who gave him an army to attack Thessalonica. The siege was raised by the Byzantines, however, and the army was defeated. Alusian barely escaped and returned to Ostrovo. One night in 1041, during dinner, Alusian took advantage of Peter II's inebriation and cut off his nose and blinded him with a kitchen knife. Since Alusian was of the blood of Samuel, he was quickly proclaimed emperor in place of Peter II by his troops, but he conspired to defect to the Byzantines. As the Bulgarian and Byzantine troops were preparing for battle, Alusian deserted to the enemy and headed for Constantinople, where his possessions and lands were restored to him, and he was rewarded with the high courtly rank of magistros. Meanwhile, though blind, Peter II Delyan resumed command of the Bulgarian forces, but the Byzantine Emperor Michael IV determined to take advantage of the situation and advanced against them. In an obscure battle near Ostrovo, the Byzantines defeated the Bulgarian troops, and Peter II Delyan was captured and taken to Constantinople, where he was perhaps executed. Norse sagas refer to the participation of the future Norwegian King Harald Hardr√•da, who allegedly cut down Peter II in the field of battle as a member of the Varangian Guard. This tradition may be supported by a laconic reference in the so-called \\"Bulgarian Apocryphal Chronicle\\". In either case, Peter II Delyan may have perished in 1041. Peter III The troops of the newly crowned Peter III took Ni≈° and Ohrid but suffered a crippling defeat in front of Kastoria. The Byzantine counter-attack took Skopje with the help of Georgi Voiteh, who first betrayed Peter III and then attempted to betray the Byzantines, but in vain. In another battle Peter III was taken captive by the Byzantines and sent, together with Georgi Voiteh, as prisoners to Constantinople. Voiteh died en route, while the former Peter III languished in prison first at Constantinople and then at Antioch. Theodore and the Second Bulgarian Empire In 1185 Theodore (Peter IV) and his younger brother Ivan Asen appeared before the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos at Kypsela to request a pronoia, but their request was dismissively refused and Ivan Asen was slapped in the ensuing argument. The insulted brothers returned home to Moesia and, taking advantage of discontent caused by the heavy taxation imposed by the Byzantine emperor to finance his campaigns against William II of Sicily and to celebrate his marriage to Margaret of Hungary, raised a revolt against Byzantine rule. The rebellion failed to immediately capture Bulgaria's historic capital Preslav, but established a new capital city at TƒÉrnovo, presumably the center of the revolt. In 1186 the rebels suffered a defeat, but Isaac II Angelos failed to exploit his victory and returned to Constantinople. With the help of the chiefly Cuman population north of the Danube, Peter IV and Ivan Asen recovered their positions and raided into Thrace. When Isaac II Angelos penetrated into Moesia again in 1187 he failed to capture either TƒÉrnovo or Loveƒç, and he signed a treaty effectively recognizing the Second Bulgarian Empire, but neither side had any intention of keeping the peace. When the Third Crusade led by Frederick I, the Holy Roman Emperor, was advancing towards Constantinople, representatives of Peter IV and Ivan Asen approached him with offers of military assistance against the latently hostile Isaac II Angelos at Ni≈° and again at Adrianople. Isaac II Angelos' failed retaliations After the passing of the Third Crusade, Isaac II Angelos decided to deal with the Bulgarians decisively. The expedition was planned on a grand scale and reached TƒÉrnovo before besieging it for a protracted period. By this time Peter IV had crowned Ivan Asen I as co-emperor in 1189 and, without abdicating, retired to Preslav. In charge of the defense of the TƒÉrnovo, Ivan Asen I incited the Byzantine emperor to a hasty retreat by spreading rumors about the arrival of a great Cuman army to the relief of the besieged city. The retreating Byzantine army was ambushed by Ivan Asen I in the Balkan passes and Isaac II barely escaped with his life in 1190. Success now definitely swung in favor of the Bulgarians, who captured the areas of Sredec (Sofia) and Ni≈° in 1191, of Belgrade in 1195, of Melnik and Prosek in 1196, while raiding parties reached as far south as Serres. When the Bulgarian emperor Ivan Asen I was murdered, his successor Kaloyan continued an aggressive policy against the Byzantine Empire by making an alliance with Ivanko, the murderer of Ivan Asen I, who had entered Byzantine service in 1196 and had become governor of Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Another ally of Kaloyan was Dobromir Hriz (Chrysos), who governed the area of Strumica. The coalition was quickly dissolved, as the Byzantines overcame both Ivanko and Dobromir Hriz. Nevertheless, Kaloyan conquered Konstanteia (Simeonovgrad) in Thrace and Varna from the Byzantine Empire in 1201, and most of Slavic Macedonia in 1202. Rise of the Latin Empire The war between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines was stalled in 1204, when Catholic forces of the Fourth Crusade captured and sacked Constantinople and created the Latin Empire, electing as emperor Baldwin I of Flanders. Although Kaloyan had offered the crusaders an alliance against the Byzantine Empire, his offer had been spurned, and the Latin Empire expressed the intention of conquering all the lands of the former Byzantine Empire, including the territories ruled by Kaloyan. The impending conflict was precipitated by the Byzantine aristocracy in Thrace, which rebelled against Latin rule in 1205 and called on Kaloyan for help, offering him its submission. Latin Wars Although during the period of time from 1204 to 1261 the Bulgarians and the Byzantines mainly fought the Latins, both still held resentment towards each other. In spite of the initially welcome successes of the Bulgarians against the Latins, the Byzantine aristocracy now began to rebel or conspire against its rule. Kaloyan also changed course and turned mercilessly on his former allies, adopting the sobriquet R≈çmaioktonos (\\"slayer of Romans\\"), as a counter-derivative from Basil II's Boulgaroktonos (\\"slayer of Bulgarians\\"). But generally the relations between the Bulgarians and Nicaea, the main Byzantine successor state, remained strong, as the new pro-Nicaean alignment of Bulgaria culminated with the marriage between Ivan Asen II's daughter Elena and the future Theodore II Laskaris, the son of Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea. The dynastic union was celebrated in 1235 and coincided with the restoration of the Bulgarian patriarchate with the consent of the eastern patriarchs and with a siege of Constantinople by the combined forces of John III and Ivan Asen II. Later on, the Bulgarians decided to aid neither the Latin Empire nor the Nicaeans because both were too involved fighting each other to attack Bulgaria. During 1240s and 1250s the Emperors John III Doukas Vatatzes and his son Theodore II Laskaris led successful campaigns against the Tsardom. Bulgarian civil wars Constantine Tikh, emperor of Bulgaria (1257‚Äì1277) Soon after the Byzantine empire was restored under Michael VIII Palaiologos, he became involved in a civil war in Bulgaria. Michael gave his support for Ivan Asen and sent several Byzantine armies to assert him on the throne. Ivailo, the current Bulgarian ruler, defeated several of these attempts, but he was blockaded for three months in DrƒÉstƒÉr (Silistra) by the Mongol allies of the Byzantine emperor. In the meantime, a Byzantine force besieged the Bulgarian capital and, after hearing a rumor of Ivailo's death in battle, the local nobility surrendered and accepted Ivan Asen III as emperor in 1279. Shortly after this, still in 1279, Ivailo suddenly appeared before TƒÉrnovo with an army, but he failed to take the well-fortified city. He nevertheless defeated a larger Byzantine relief force near Varna and another in the Balkan passes. Desperate for relief, Ivan Asen III fled TƒÉrnovo in 1280, and his brother-in-law, George Terter I, seized the throne, uniting the factious aristocracy and gradually taking away the support for Ivailo.  Theodore Svetoslav's Byzantine war During the 13th century the Byzantine and Bulgarian empires were beginning to fade, and they often allied with each other to ward off powerful foes, such as the Golden Horde and the Turks. In 1301, however, the new, aggressive Bulgarian emperor Theodore Svetoslav had several bloody encounters with the Byzantines. He first defeated the former emperor Michael Asen II, who unsuccessfully tried to advance into Bulgaria with a Byzantine army in about 1302. As a consequence of his success, Theodore felt secure enough to take the offensive by 1303 and captured several fortresses in northeastern Thrace, including Mesembria (NesebƒÉr), Ankhialos (Pomorie), Sozopolis (Sozopol), and Agathopolis (Ahtopol) in the following year. The Byzantine counter-attack failed at the battle on the river Skafida near Sozopolis, where the co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos was turned to flight. Nevertheless, the war continued, with Michael IX and Theodore Svetoslav taking turns pillaging each other's lands. In 1305 Theodore's uncle Aldimir seems to have entered into some sort of agreement with the Byzantines, and Theodore Svetoslav annexed his lands. In 1306 Svetoslav gained the services of the rebellious Alans, who had previously worked as mercenaries for the Byzantines, settling them in Bulgaria, and he made unsuccessful overtures to the mercenaries of the Catalan Company, who had also rebelled against their Byzantine employers. The war ended with a peace treaty in 1307, cemented with a marriage between the widowed Theodore Svetoslav and Theodora Palaiologina, a daughter of Michael IX.  George Terter II's Byzantine war George Terter II became the Bulgarian ruler after his father died in 1322, and he became actively involved in the civil war in the Byzantine Empire, where the throne was being contested by Andronikos II Palaiologos and his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos. Taking advantage of the situation, George invaded Byzantine Thrace and, encountering little, if any, resistance, conquered the major city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and part of the surrounding area in 1322 or 1323. A Bulgarian garrison was installed under the command of a general named Ivan the Russian, while a court scribe praised George Terter II as a \\"possessor of the Bulgarian and the Greek sceptre\\". A new campaign later the same year conquered several fortresses around Adrianople, but the Bulgarians were finally defeated by Andronikos III. The Byzantine emperor was preparing for an invasion of Bulgaria, when he heard the news that George Terter II had died, apparently of natural causes. Michael Asen III's wars The death of George Terter II was followed by a brief period of confusion and uncertainty, which was exploited by the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. The Byzantines overran northeastern Thrace and captured a number of important cities. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, Vojsil, brother of the former Bulgarian emperor Smilec, ensconced himself in KrƒÉn, assuming control of the valley between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora. At this point the newly elected Bulgarian emperor Michael Asen III marched south to fight Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army was besieging Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Although Michael Asen III managed to force Andronikos III to retreat, the Byzantines managed to capture Philippopolis while the Bulgarians were changing garrisons. In spite of this loss, Michael Asen III expelled Vojsil and recovered control over northern and northeastern Thrace in 1324. The status quo was confirmed by a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire, which was cemented by Michael Asen III's marriage to Theodora Palaiologina, the sister of Andronikos III Palaiologos, who had been previously married to Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria. =Byzantine civil war= In 1327 Michael Asen III involved himself in the renewed civil war in the Byzantine Empire, taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival, Andronikos II, obtained the support of the Serbian king Stephen Deƒçanski. Andronikos III and Michael Asen III met and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. Nevertheless, Michael Asen III entered into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and border lands. Marching to the frontier with his army, Michael Asen III sent a detachment to ostensibly help Andronikos II, but which actually intended to capture the Emperor. Forewarned by his grandson, Andronikos II prudently kept the Bulgarian detachment away from the capital and his person. Giving up on his ploy, Michael Asen III attempted to gain the lands by force but retreated before the advance of Andronikos III. Another showdown in front of Adrianople in 1328 ended without battle and with the renewal of the peace treaty, after which Michael Asen III returned to his country, but not before securing a large payoff.  Ivan Alexander's defence of Bulgaria Ivan Alexander In the early 1340s relations with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Shishman (≈†i≈°man), one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. His show of force backfired, however, as the Byzantines called his bluff and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of Smyrna, Umur Beg. Landing in the Danube Delta, the Turks pillaged the countryside and attacked the Bulgarian cities in the vicinity. Restrained by his own demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again at the end of 1341, claiming that he had been summoned by the people of Adrianople. There his troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines. In 1341‚Äì1347, the Byzantine Empire was plunged into a second protracted civil war, between the regency for Emperor John V Palaiologos and his intended guardian John VI Kantakouzenos. The neighbors of the Byzantines took advantage of the civil war, and while Stefan Du≈°an sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency. Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, they maintained their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine important fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains in 1344. Another Byzantine civil war erupted in Thrace in 1352 between Matthew Cantacuzenus and John V, who was reaching his majority and becoming restless at being excluded from power by his father-in-law, John VI Cantacuzenus. In an attempt to pacify him, and also to remove him from the capital, the emperor assigned him in late 1351 or 1352 an appanage in the western part of Byzantine Thrace and in the Rhodopes. His son, Matthew, who ruled the territory, was removed and received a new one, located to the east and centered in Adrianople. The two princes were soon quarreling over boundaries, and Matthew refused to recognize John V as heir to the throne. Soon war broke out between them. After hiring a large number of Turkish mercenaries and with the promise of support from the Thessalonians (long-time enemies of Cantacuzenus), John marched against Matthews' appanage. One after another, Matthew's towns, including Adrianople, quickly surrendered to the young Palaeologian emperor. Expecting serious retaliation John V sought and was promised help from both Serbia and Bulgaria. Meanwhile, after hiring more Ottoman Turks, the Emperor John Cantacuzenus then retook all the cities that had surrendered to John V, who retreated west seeking Serbian help. Stefan Du≈°an obliged by sending him four thousand horsemen. However, Orhan, the Ottoman bey, provided Cantacuzenus with ten thousand. The Ottoman cavalry met the Serbs and possibly a Bulgarian force ‚Äî since after the battle, Turkish forces plundered Bulgaria ‚Äî in an open field battle near Demotika in October 1352. The more numerous Ottomans crushed the Serbs and Bulgars in the first major battle in Europe between Ottomans and Europeans. Fall of Bulgaria and Byzantium In 1396 Bulgaria fell to the Ottoman Turks, and in 1453 Constantinople was captured. Since both became part of the Ottoman Empire, this was the end of the long series of Bulgarian- Byzantine Wars.

It was in operation from September 18, 1942, until November 30, 1945, and held as many as 8,475 Japanese Americans forcibly evacuated from California.Niiya, Brian. \\"Rohwer \\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2014-05-29. The Rohwer War Relocation Center Cemetery is located here, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992. History The of land on which Rohwer was built had been purchased by the Farm Security Administration from tax-delinquent landowners in the 1930s. It remained largely abandoned until the War Relocation Authority, which oversaw the World War II incarceration program, took it over in 1942. It planned to use this facility to incarcerate ethnic Japanese, including American citizens from West Coast areas considered strategic to the war effort. Governor Homer Adkins initially opposed the WRA's proposal to build Rohwer and its neighbor, Jerome, in Arkansas, but relented after being assured that the Japanese American detainees would be controlled by armed white guards at these facilities and they would be removed from the state at the end of the war. During this era, Arkansas had Jim Crow laws and continued with its disenfranchisement of African-American citizens started at the turn of the century. The Linebarger-Senne Construction Company was contracted to build the camp at a cost of $4.8 million; it worked under the supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers. The land was heavily forested and swampy due to its proximity to the Mississippi River 5 miles to the east. Extensive clearing and draining was necessary, making construction at the site a difficult and slow-going task. The camp was still under construction when the first inmates began to arrive. Ultimately the camp held administrative offices, schools, a hospital, and 36 residential blocks, each with twelve 20' by 120' barracks divided into several \\"apartments\\", as well as communal dining and sanitary facilities, all contained within a guarded barbed-wire fence. The architect of the camp was Edward F. Neild of Shreveport, Louisiana, who also designed the camp at Jerome. A young woman in the woodworking class Rohwer opened on September 18, 1942, and reached a peak population of 8,475 by March 1943. Most detainees had been forced out of their homes and businesses in Los Angeles or the San Joaquin Valley in California. A large portion of Rohwer inmates were school-age children, most born in the US. About 2,000 students attended the camp's schools, which were opened on November 9, 1942 after some delay. Adults took jobs with the administration, hospital, schools, and mess halls, in addition to agricultural work or labor details outside camp. As of the site used for residences and other buildings, officials used the remainder of Rohwer's land to grow more than 100 agricultural products. These were used to supplement the inmates' food rations (kept to a bare minimum of 37 cents a day per inmate to avoid rumors that the WRA was \\"coddling\\" Japanese Americans). In 1943, the WRA required all adults in Rohwer and the other camps to submit to a series of questions. Officially, it was presented as the registration process to obtain clearance to leave camp for work or school ‚Äî and it was initially distributed only to the citizen Nisei who were eligible for leave, before being extended to the first-generation Issei ‚Äî but administrators soon began to focus instead on assessing the \\"loyalty\\" of imprisoned Japanese Americans. The \\"loyalty questionnaire,\\" as it came to be known, created anger and confusion because of two questions: one asked Japanese Americans if they were willing to volunteer for military service (despite their mistreatment by the government and the army) and the other if they would \\"forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan\\" (although many had never held such allegiance in the first place). The set-up of the questions was confusing and internees were suspicious of their true purpose. The loyalty questionnaire and subsequent recruitment efforts proved especially unpopular in the Jerome camp, located 27 miles south of Rohwer. Only 2 percent of eligible men in Jerome (and in Rohwer) enlisted. Some 2,147 others, a quarter of Jerome's population, were classified as \\"disloyal\\" after giving unfavorable responses to the questionnaire. They were transferred to the \\"segregation center\\" at Tule Lake, California.Niiya, Brian. \\"Jerome \\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2014-08-07. The decline in population, combined with earlier unrest over poor working conditions in the camp, resulted in authorities closing the Jerome camp at the end of June 1944. A significant number of former Jerome inmates were transferred to Rohwer. Together with the Tule Lake Segregation Center, Rohwer was the last WRA camp to close, on November 30, 1945. Rohwer today Monument to the Men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Rohwer Memorial Cemetery Monument to the men of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team The largest remaining structure is the high school gymnasium/auditorium, which was added to and was in service with the local school before it closed in July 2004. The tallest structure is the smokestack from the hospital incinerator. Neither of these is marked in any way to indicate historical significance. The rail line used to bring internees and supplies to the camp remains, though it is apparently abandoned. Some of the rails date back to World War II and before. This rail line also served the Jerome War Relocation Center, which was located southwest of Rohwer. Various building foundations, walkways, culverts and other improvements are still visible and some are still in use by the local residents. Trees planted by residents have grown tall. The camp cemetery survives as the only site still identified as having been part of the internment center. It was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1992. It has a monument to Japanese American war dead from the camp, and also a monument to those who died at the camp. The camp site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. A tank-shaped memorial, made of reinforced concrete, guards the cemetery, commemorating Japanese Americans who fought for their country during World War II. 581 menhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nihl23t9tg7uxv/AAAUYc2PkAR72q99FMxy7jGfa/14)%20SOLDIERS%20AND%20CAMPS?dl=0&preview;=!SOLDIERS+AND+THE+CAMPS+(Alphabetical)+646B.pdf&subfolder;_nav_tracking=1 joined the U.S. Army from this camp, either volunteering or accepting their conscription into the legendary 100th Infantry Battalion, the famed 442nd RCT and MIS. Thirty-one who came from Rohwer died in action, and their names are inscribed on the memorial, as well as a later memorial raised nearby. In its National Historic Landmark summary on the Rohwer Relocation Center Cemetery, the National Park Service writes: > Rohwer Relocation Camp was constructed in the late summer and early fall of > 1942 as a result of Executive Order 9066 (February 19, 1942). Under this > order, over 110,000 Japanese Americans and their immigrant parents were > forcibly removed from the three Pacific Coast States--California, Oregon, > and Washington. In all, ten camps were established in desolate sites, all > chosen for their distance from the Pacific Coast. Over 10,000 evacuees > passed through Rohwer during its existence, and over two thirds of these > were American citizens. The monuments found within the camp's cemetery are > perhaps the most poignant record of this time.\\" In its summary on the Rohwer Relocation Center Cemetery, the National Park Service indicates that the cemetery's condition is threatened due to deterioration of the grave markers and monuments, but that ownership of the site is unclear. Deterioration is visible in photographs of the site. Deterioration is discussed in a report from the National Park Service to the President. The Find A Grave website lists 25 memorials for Rohwer War Relocation Center Cemetery. The cemetery is located west of State Route 1, approximately northeast of McGehee, Arkansas. Signs identify the graded road which goes from the highway to the cemetery, where there is room to park automobiles. Heritage Site The Rohwer War Relocation Center site is now an Arkansas State University Heritage Site, and features a memorial, the camp cemetery, interpretive panels and audio kiosks. The Japanese American Internment Museum opened in nearby McGehee, Arkansas in 2013 and serves as the history museum and unofficial visitor center for the Rohwer War Relocation Center. Exhibits include a film, oral histories, photographs and personal artifacts of the internees. Shooting of residents by a civilian at Rohwer M.C. Brown, a tenant farmer on horseback on his way home from deer hunting, came across some Japanese Americans from the Rohwer camp, on a work detail in the woods. He fired his gun, and one of the Japanese American men was struck in the hip by a pellet while another was wounded in the calf of the leg. The Japanese Americans were working in the woods under the supervision of a government engineer when the shooting occurred.

It is an endemic resident breeding species in Costa Rica and Panama. It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the mountain wren, Troglodytes solstitialis, of South America. It breeds in mountains at 900 m to 2500 m altitude (sometimes up to 3000 m in wet epiphyte-laden forests, and semi-open areas such as woodland edges, tall second growth and pasture with trees. Its cup nest is constructed in a swinging mass of epiphytes hanging from a branch 5‚Äì15 m high in a tree. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for about two weeks to hatching, and the young fledge in about the same length of time again. The adult ochraceous wren is 9.5 cm long and weighs 9.5 g. It resembles the house wren, but is brighter with broad yellow-buff supercilia. It has pale brown upperparts with buff underparts, becoming whitish on the belly. The sides of the head are a rich ochre colour. Young birds are similar but have paler supercilia and mottled underparts. The call of this species is a thin peeew, and the song is mixture of whistles and trills. These birds forage actively in vegetation in pairs, family groups, or as part of a mixed-species feeding flock.

Aoki may have been the first Asian actress to garner top billing in American motion pictures.  Life and career  Born in Tokyo, Japan, Aoki came to California in 1899 with her uncle, Otojir≈ç Kawakami, his geisha wife, Kawakami Sadayakko, and Otojir≈ç's troupe of actors. At the their first stop in San Francisco, Tsuru performed with the troupe and assisted Sadayakko at a Palace Hotel tea ceremony where attendees raved over her \\"diminutive daintiness.\\" But when the troupe ran into severe financial difficulties, Otojir≈ç made arrangements to have Tsuru adopted by Toshio Aoki, a sketch artist for a local newspaper.Joseph L. Anderson, Enter a Samurai: Kawakami Otojir≈ç and Japanese Theatre in the West, 2 v. (Tucson: Wheatmark, 2011), 1: 65, 88. According to Anderson, Aoki was an old friend of an American missionary couple the Kawakamis had met aboard ship, Merriman Colbert Harris and Flora Best Harris (89). Tsuru Aoki started taking lessons in ballet dance in New York, when she went along with her uncle Toshio, who was hired by David Belasco for The Darling of the Gods. After Toshio's death a reporter looked after Aoki. Aoki began her acting career after returning to Los Angeles and performing in stage productions in the city's Japanese Theatre where she was noticed by film producer Thomas Ince who placed the young actress under contract. She was also responsible for recruiting Japanese actors for Imperial Japanese Company, a subsidiary of New York Motion Picture Corporation. Aoki made her film debut in the Majestic film studios release The Oath of Tsuru San in 1913 opposite actor William Garwood. Her follow-up film was the 1914 Ince produced O Mimi San, which starred the American child actress Mildred Harris and a handsome young newcomer named Sessue Hayakawa, whom Aoki had acted with onstage at the Japanese Theatre the previous year. The couple began a romantic relationship that would culminate in their marriage on May 1, 1914, just weeks before the release of their critically acclaimed and publicly successful film The Wrath of the Gods ‚Äì a melodrama about an interracial romance between a man portrayed by Caucasian actor/director Frank Borzage and an Asian woman portrayed by Aoki. The film also starred Sessue Hayakawa and featured actress Gladys Brockwell. Hayakawa and Aoki would eventually make more than twenty films together throughout the 1910s and 1920s. Tsuru Aoki (right) with actor and husband Sessue Hayakawa in a screen shot of the 1919 film The Dragon Painter. Aoki, ca. 1915 One of Aoki's most recalled films of the silent period is the 1919 William Worthington-directed The Dragon Painter, based on the novel of the same title by Sidney McCall, in which Aoki starred as a young woman who convinces an isolated, mentally deranged artist named Tatsu (portrayed by Hayakawa) to come down from the mountains so that she may civilize him and he may further his artistic abilities. Other notable films of the period were The Typhoon (1914), The Vigil (1914), The Geisha (1914), The Chinatown Mystery (1915), His Birthright (1918), and The Breath of the Gods (1920). Throughout the 1910s, Aoki would appear in approximately forty films, often in leading- lady roles which was a first for an Asian actress. Some of her co-stars of the era included such notable names as Marin Sais, Frank Borzage, Gladys Brockwell, Mildred Harris, Jack Holt, Jane Wolfe, Dagmar Godowsky, Vola Vale, Florence Vidor, Earle Foxe, and Walter Long. After a series of moderately successful Ince-produced two-reel serials, Aoki's career in the United States began to falter (while her husband's career began to build momentum), and the couple travelled to France in 1923 and filmed the popular √âdouard-√âmile Violet-directed drama La Bataille. After returning to America, however, Aoki made only three more films before retiring from the screen to raise her and Hayakawa's three children. Her last silent screen performance was the 1924 release The Danger Line. Aoki would only return to the screen in 1960 (her first talkie) to once again appear with her husband in the drama Hell to Eternity. She died the following year in Japan of acute peritonitis at the age of 69.

If is a complex-valued, continuous function on the contour and if its absolute value is bounded by a constant for all on , then :\\\\left\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\right \\\\le M\\\\, l(\\\\Gamma), where is the arc length of . In particular, we may take the maximum :M:= \\\\max_{z\\\\in\\\\Gamma}f(z) as upper bound. Intuitively, the lemma is very simple to understand. If a contour is thought of as many smaller contour segments connected together, then there will be a maximum for each segment. Out of all the maximum s for the segments, there will be an overall largest one. Hence, if the overall largest is summed over the entire path then the integral of over the path must be less than or equal to it. Formally, the inequality can be shown to hold using the definition of contour integral, the absolute value inequality for integrals and the formula for the length of a curve as follows: :\\\\left\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f(z)\\\\, dz \\\\right = \\\\left\\\\int_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta f(\\\\gamma(t))\\\\gamma'(t)\\\\, dt \\\\right \\\\leq \\\\int_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta \\\\leftf(\\\\gamma(t))\\\\right\\\\left\\\\gamma'(t)\\\\right\\\\, dt \\\\leq M \\\\int_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta \\\\left\\\\gamma'(t)\\\\right\\\\, dt = M\\\\, l(\\\\Gamma) The estimation lemma is most commonly used as part of the methods of contour integration with the intent to show that the integral over part of a contour goes to zero as goes to infinity. An example of such a case is shown below.  Example  The contour . Problem. Find an upper bound for :\\\\left\\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\frac{1}{(z^2+1)^2} \\\\, dz\\\\right, where is the upper half-circle with radius traversed once in the counterclockwise direction. Solution. First observe that the length of the path of integration is half the circumference of a circle with radius , hence :l(\\\\Gamma)=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(2\\\\pi a)=\\\\pi a. Next we seek an upper bound for the integrand when . By the triangle inequality we see that :z^2=\\\\leftz^2\\\\right = \\\\leftz^2+1-1\\\\right \\\\le \\\\leftz^2+1\\\\right+1, therefore :\\\\leftz^2+1\\\\right\\\\ge z^2 - 1 = a^2 - 1>0 because on .

Research has shown that the Tagbanwa are possible descendants of the Tabon Man, thus making them one of the original inhabitants of the Philippines.The Tagbanua Tribe. Accessed August 28, 2008. They are a brown-skinned, slim, and straight-haired ethnic group.Ethnic Minorities in the South: Tagbanua . Accessed August 28, 2008. There are two major classifications based on the geographical location where they can be found. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan, Quezon, and Puerto Princesa. Calamian Tagbanwa, on the other hand, are found in Baras coast, Busuanga Island, Coron Island and in some parts of El Nido.Palawan Tourism Council: Palawan Culture. Accessed August 28, 2008. These two Tagbanwa sub-groups speak different languages and do not exactly have the same customs.National Commission on Indigenous People. Accessed August 30, 2008. History According to folk history, the Tagbanwa had an early relationship with Brunei, with the first sultan of Brunyu, from the place called Burnay. Formal history of the Tagbanwa tribe began in 1521 when Magellan's ships docked in Palawan for provisions. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, recorded that the Tagbanwa practiced the ritual of blood compact, cultivated their fields, hunted with blowpipes and thick wooden arrows, valued brass rings and chains, bells, knives, and copper wire for binding fish hooks, raised large and very tame cocks for fighting, and distilled rice wine. Until the latter part of the 17th century, southern Palawan was under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Brunei, leading to friction between Spaniards and the Sultan. During this time, and for almost three hundred years, the Spaniards and the Muslims of Sulu, Mindanao, Palawan, and north Borneo were at war. In the 19th century, the Tagbanwa continued to believe in their native gods. Each year, a big feast is celebrated after each harvest to honor their deities. When the Spanish regime ended and the Americans occupied the Philippines, some changes came to the island of Palawan, and to the Tagbanwa. In 1904, Iwahig became the site of a penal colony, which displaced the Tagbanwa as it expanded. In 1910, the Americans put up a reservation for the Tagbanwa. In succeeding years, internal migration from the Visayan islands and from Luzon, the dominance of the Christian religion, and the absorption of the island into economic and political mainstream marginalized the Tagbanwa people. =Ancestral domain= In 1998, the Tagbanwa of Coron Island were awarded a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) over more than 22,000 hectares of land and sea. CADT is the title to the land and the sea that have sustained the community for centuries. It gives the Tagbanwa the right to manage the area and preserve its rich marine and land resources.PCIJ: Tagbanua Win First Ever Ancestral Waters Claim . Accessed August 28, 2008. The Coron Island Ancestral Domain of the Tagbanwa people covers the two villages of Banuang Daan and Cabugao, and the neighboring Delian Island. The ancestral domain is currently ruled by HM Tribal Chieftain Rodolfo Aguilar I, assisted by his Council of Elders. The Calamian Tagbanwa of Coron filed the first formal legal claim in the Philippines for their \\"ancestral waters.\\" The initiative also became the first ancestral waters claim to be recognized by a government. In March 2010, Tabganwas previously driven away from Calauit island were issued a CADT covering over 55,000 hectares in recognition of the communities' ancestral land and waters. The title covers the entire island and includes 50,000 hectares of ancestral waters surrounding the island. Culture =Language= Museo Palawan (Museum of Palawan). The Tagbanwa people have their own native languages (Aborlan Tagbanwa, Calamian Tagbanwa, and Central Tagbanwa) and writing system, however, they are also proficient in speaking the Palawano language and several other dialects like Tandulanon, Silanganon, and Baras in each locality, while a significant number of them can comprehend Tagalog, Batak, Cuyonon, and Calawian languages. =Indigenous Tagbanwa Religion= The Kayangan Lake is considered a sacred place by the Tagbanwa people. =Immortals= *Mangindusa: also referred as Nagabacaban, the highest-ranking deity who lives in Awan-awan, the region beyond the Langit; the god of the heavens and the punisher of crimeCCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Peoples of the Philippines (1994).

The basic social unit of the Tagbanwas is their nuclear family composed of a married couple and their children. They are monogamous. They live in houses that are made up of bamboo and wood for a strong frame, anahaw leaves for roof and walls, and bamboo slats for the flooring. Tagbanwa live in compact villages of 45 to 500 individuals.Thinkquest: Palawan Islands . Accessed August 28, 2008. Families can either be free men or nobles, which, in the Southern tribes are known as Usba. =Visual arts and crafts= The traditional costumes of the Tagbanwa were fashioned from the bark of trees, particularly the salugin. The preparation of this bark was unique. After being felled, the tree would be cut around the trunk, the outer bark stripped off to expose the inner layer. A mallet would beat the layer, until it is soft enough to hang loose from the bole. This is washed and dried under the sun. In the past, menfolk wore simple loincloths, supported by a woven rattan waistband called ambalad, while women wore only brief wraparound skirts made from bark. The Tagbanua later adopt some articles of Muslim clothing. At present, while many Tagbanwa still wear their traditional apparel, western-type clothing has found its way among the people.Tagabanua by Mark Joel Velasquez . Accessed August 28, 2008. A Tagbanwa elder weaving a pandan mat. In the past, when both men and women wore their hair long, they filled and blackened their teeth, and carved earplugs from the hardwood bantilinaw. The Tagbanwa also carved wooden combs and bracelets. They strung bead necklaces to be used in covering women's necks. Anklets of copper and brass wire were also crafted and worn by women. Tagbanwa women wear bright body ornament and brightly colored clothes. They dress just like the non-tribe lowlanders but some elder men prefer to use G-strings for comfort while tilling the field or going fishing. Baskets and woodcarvings are the more notable products of Tagbanwa artistic crafts today. They excel in the number of designs they apply to their tingkop (harvest basket). These baskets are made of blackened and natural bamboo, which makes the designs stand out. The cone-shaped type of basket is another fine example of Tagbanwa skilled artistry. Using black and natural color designs outside, the center of the cone has the bamboo strip skived slightly smaller, creating even holes for the screen. The funnel effect is accomplished through a close weaving of the bamboo strips towards the top. The soft rice baskets, called bayong-bayong, are made with different unusual shapes. These have square bases and round tops. To produce interesting block and V-shapes, the plain buri sides superimposed with colored buri. Color is woven into the Tagbanwa basket with the used of dyed palm leaves. Blackened woodcarvings of animals, with simple etched or incised features exposing the original white grain of the wood, are the most well known examples of Tagbanwa woodcarvings or sculpture. Some of the objects carved are mammanuk (rooster), a ritual bowl, kiruman (turtle), kararaga (a native bird), dugyan (a small ground animal), lizards, and wild pigs. Carved animals are used with rice, betel nut, and other offerings to attract the deities and spirit relatives in the pagdiwata rituals. The turtles, for instance, floats on grains of palay in an ancient Ming trade bowl. Others that are not used in rituals become toys for children. =Performing arts= Music A Tagbanwa musical instrument made of bamboo inscribed with Tagbanwa script. Complementing the rich Tagbanwa rituals and social gatherings in the past was an assortment of musical instruments. These included the aruding or jaw harp; the babarak or nose flute; the tipanu or mouth flute; the pagang and tibuldu, two variations of the bamboo zithers; the kudlung or boat lute; the gimbal or drum, whose top was made from the skin of the bayawak or monitor lizard; and the tiring, composed of lengths of bamboo with openings of various sizes producing different notes when struck with a stick. In addition, there were two generic types of gongs obtained from the shallow babandil. The mouth flute is still in use, and the gongs and drums are still played during rituals. Modern acoustic type guitar and the ukulele, which is fashioned from a half coconut shell, supplant the other instruments. Dance The known dances associated with the rituals are the following: abellano, also called soriano, a traditional dance performed by males; bugas- bugasan, a dance for all participants of a pagdiwata, after they have drunk the ceremonial tabad (rice wine); kalindapan, solo dance by the female babaylan and her attendants; runsay, ritual dances performed by the villagers on the seashore, where bamboo rafts laden with food offering are floated for the gods; sarungkay, a healing dance by the main babaylan as she balances a sword on her head and waves ugsang or palm leaf strip; tugatak and tarindak, dances perform by the villagers who attend an inim or pagdiwata; tamigan, performed by male combatants using round winnowers or bilao to represent shields. The dancing accompanying the runsay, performed about midnight and lasting until daybreak, is possibly the most moving of all Tagbanwa dances, since it is a part of a sacred ritual that takes place only once a year, and is performed on the beach from where the ritual raft has been launched towards the sea world. Guests who attend the albarka ritual watch dances such as the busak-busak, the spider dance; batak ribid, a dance simulating the gathering of camote; bungalon, a showing off dance; bugsay-bugsay, a paddle dance using fans; segutset, a courtship dance; and tarek, a traditional dance. The andardi is a festival dance of the Tagbanwa in and around Aborlan, perform at social gatherings. When dancing during a festival, the performers are dressed in their costumes, and hold in each hand a dried palm leaf called palaspas. The music of the andardi is composed of one part of twelve measures, played or sung continuously throughout the dance. Drum or gongs accompanies the music and the song. Drama Drama in Tagbanwa society is expressed in the mimetic dances imitating animals, such as busak-busak, and those showing occupations, such as batak ribid and bugsay-bugsay. But the most important mimetic forms are the rituals where the priestess is possessed by and plays the role of the deity to whom the offerings are being made. Economic activity They cultivate rice in swidden or kaingin field that is intercropped with sweet potato, corn, and cassava. Those in the coastal areas indulge in fishing and exchange it with agricultural products for consumption. They also gather forest products such as gum, rattan, and honey for cash. The highest potential source of income for the Tagbanwa are handicrafts particularly woodworking, mat making and basketry, the raw materials for which are readily available to them.Palawan Profile at Home.comcast.net.

To accommodate the tour, three new members were added to the band; Jay Planty on guitar, Ted Preiss on bass, and Jason Cobb on drums. For the most part the tour was uneventful, playing mostly as a supporting act, the group performed before crowds that were largely unfamiliar with their history. On New Year's Eve, 1986, the tour concluded in Fallon, Nevada, the birthplace of the band, with a performance in what had long been alleged to be a haunted slaughterhouse. A large concrete edifice, the abandoned slaughterhouse had been the site of many strange sightings and the subject of local ghost stories for over 20 years. More of a video shoot and recording session than an actual concert, it was made open to the public and several hundred of the locals braved the spirits and the cold to attend the show. With their now stripped down, punkier sound, the band tore through several versions of In the Attic, Miron, Gone With the Worms, A Cool Dark Place to Die, Red Asphalt and Within the Ruins of a Mind. The concert was intended to conclude at the stroke of midnight, ushering in the New Year. But sometime slightly after 11:00pm a bizarre event occurred; all the power suddenly turned off and the slaughterhouse was thrown into total blackness. A few seconds later an unearthly moan howled forth from every speaker and amplifier. Another worldly wail that lasted nearly 30 seconds. Stunned and terrified, the majority of the crowd hastily dispersed and the concert came to a screeching halt. To this date it is still a matter of speculation as to whether this was an actual supernatural occurrence or was staged by the band in an attempt to add to their mystic and legend. What is known is that Jay Planty, Ted Preiss, and Jason Cobb left the band after the event. Planty and Preiss would return several years later, but this was the last time the band recorded at any alleged haunted sites or cemeteries. Three of the Songs from the session were chosen to be released as the band's first 7-inch ep, In the Attic. Along with the title track the record included Gone with the Worms and Within the Ruins of a Mind. The record was a howling success and was the first in what would be a long string of 7 inch eps the band would release.

It took place on August 26, 1991, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. SummerSlam 1991 is remembered for the on-screen wedding of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth, dubbed \\"A Match Made in Heaven\\" by announcer Gene Okerlund. Savage and Elizabeth had been married in real life since December 1984. WWF personalities shown at the reception afterward included Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, J.J. Dillon, The Undertaker, and Jake Roberts. The last two were uninvited guests. Roberts proceeded to frighten Elizabeth with his snake while Undertaker attacked Savage with an urn. This was contrasted with \\"A Match Made in Hell\\", the main event of the show, which was a handicap tag team match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior against Sgt. Slaughter, General Adnan and Colonel Mustafa. It was Slaughter's final on-screen appearance as an Iraqi sympathizer, a storyline fueled by the Gulf War. Among the other on-screen highlights of the event was The Legion of Doom defeating The Nasty Boys to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The team became the only tag team in wrestling history to have held the WWF Tag Team Championship, the NWA World Tag Team Championship, and the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Another highlight was Bret Hart winning his first singles championship in the WWF when he defeated Mr. Perfect for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. After winning the match, Hart climbed into the stands to hug his parents Stu and Helen Hart. Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view, produced every August by World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \\"The Biggest Party of the Summer,\\" it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \\"Big Four\\".Ian Hamilton. Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition (p. 160) It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. 1991 was the fourth event in the SummerSlam chronology. Aftermath Highlights of the wedding reception for Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth were aired on the WWF's syndicated and cable programs, and included The Undertaker and Jake Roberts crashing the party. Savage ‚Äì who was still barred from competing as an active wrestler, per his WrestleMania VII \\"retirement match\\" loss to the Ultimate Warrior ‚Äì would become the target of Roberts' insults, which continued to grow through the fall of 1991. Eventually, Savage had enough and, while doing color commentary duties on WWF Superstars, came to the ring while Roberts was delivering an anti-Savage promo, only for Roberts to severely beat Savage, tie him into the ring ropes and allow his devenomized king cobra to bite his arm. The aftermath of that incident led to Savage's reinstatement as an active wrestler and a match at the \\"This Tuesday in Texas\\" pay-per-view event. on September 7th 1991 Bret Hart defeated Irwin R. Shyster in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament Following his team's loss to Hogan and Ultimate Warrior, Slaughter re-evaluated his support of Iraq, decided he had made a bad decision and became a face again, appearing in vignettes next to American landmarks, saying \\"I want my country back.\\" During an episode of Superstars, Jim Duggan was under attack from The Nasty Boys, and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months; Slaughter also defeated Colonel Mustafa and General Adnan in a series of matches. Despite Slaughter's face turn, he was still named 1991's \\"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\\" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine for his pro-Iraqi gimmick. SummerSlam 1991 marked Andr√© the Giant's last United States pay-per-view appearance in his lifetime. By now using crutches to get around due to his continuing health problems with acromegaly, Andr√© would make several appearances during the WWF's tour of England in September and October 1991. These were his last appearances in the WWF during his lifetime, as he died on January 27, 1993. Also dealing with injuries was Mr. Perfect, who would take a three-month-long absence from the WWF to recuperate; he would return to WWF television as a heel-favoring color commentator on Superstars. He would not return to in ring competition again until the 1992 Survivor Series. =Ultimate Warrior controversy= Off-screen, there was an incident involving The Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon at this event. One month before the pay-per-view, Warrior wrote a letter to McMahon threatening to no-show the main event tag team match unless paid $550,000 that he claimed was owed to him. In 2005, it was revealed by Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter that dealing with the matter physically for Vince McMahon was a possibility when they became aware of Warrior's threat.The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior DVD McMahon, who didn't want Hogan and Slaughter to get into a physical altercation with Warrior, paid Warrior the money, and then fired him immediately following SummerSlam. Warrior later responded on his website to these allegations by stating he was owed money stemming from work performed at WrestleMania VII and that he was actually suspended by McMahon immediately after the show, but quit the WWF out of protest. McMahon would later state that while he couldn't make a last-minute change in the card due to the fans expecting the match, he \\"could not wait to fire him\\" after the pay-per-view. Warrior was not present for the in-ring celebration with Hogan and Sid Justice following the match. In the aftermath, Warrior's anticipated feud with Jake Roberts ‚Äì who, in another storyline that aired a few weeks earlier, had turned heel after tricking Warrior into believing he would aid him in his feud with The Undertaker ‚Äì was canceled, and the Roberts-Savage feud was conceived instead.

Description The institute was established by Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, a well-known Pakistani Islamic scholar, who has been inspired by Amin Ahsan Islahi and Hamiduddin Farahi. The organization describes its existence as a reaction to the problem in current Islamic learning, which focuses on \\"the foundational principles and the emanating discourses of a particular school of thought as well as the polemics to establish their superiority over those of others.\\" The institution as a research and educational center aims to facilitate and perpetuate the explanatory and research work on the \\"true understanding of Islam.\\" One of its main positions articulated by its founder involved persuading the Islamic ministry in Pakistan to address the way mosques in the country are currently run privately where anyone can preach without permission or accountability. Ghamidi maintains that this liberty has been misused by the extremist elements to promote extremism and hatred. Projects The administration of Al-Mawrid Global is in the hands of its Board of Governors. The administrative system is founded on democratic principles. The President of the institution serves as the academic and intellectual patron, and the Secretary General is entrusted with its administrative affairs.

Sometimes they are charged with fueling controversial topics, like calling for reform in the infamous Hudood laws. Javed Ghamidi is also falsely referred by some as having involvement in the controversial movie 'Khuda kay liye', which brought the issue of radicalization into the limelight in Pakistan. Local and orthodox scholars often reject this school of thought and their understanding of Islam. Some also refer to them as 'clean shave mullas'. Ghamidi and Al-Mawrid's stance on Islam led to a conflict with the Taliban, which eventually led to Ghamidi fleeing his country in 2010. Ghamidi's staff was murdered by the extremist group and Al-Mawrid is now being run through a website and its branches located in Australia, Canada, India, United Kingdom, and the United States.

Their original lineup consisted of brothers Justin (lead guitar and vocals) and Kayle Greiman (bass) with drummer Brett Schoneman.  Background  Their self-titled debut album was released on Five Minute Walk Records in June 2000. It was fairly successful, particularly \\"Our Finest Hour\\". Also noteworthy on it was their cover of Bon Jovi's \\"Living on a Prayer\\". The inside cover features a photograph of the band wearing mirror sunglasses and jeans with holes in them. Philmore could be somewhat described as punk rock. In live performance they appeared entirely to be a punk rock band. Their music indicates that they were heavily influenced by MXPX. The band's music also had an 1980s edge of both pop and glam metal. Their reputation as a punk band was further reinforced by the fact that they were performing music that was not well accepted in their time. Justin's vocals were unusually high for a male, causing comparisons to be drawn between him and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Philmore did extensive touring in the United States after the release of their first album. They toured with Relient K, Bleach, Holland in the Back to the Few Tour and Watashi Wa, among numerous other bands. At times they played to sold-out crowds of hundreds of people, but they refused to cancel a show: they once played for a total of five fans, all of whom they took out for dinner before the show. In July 2002, their second album, The Bare Truth About Philmore, was released. It was considerably more \\"mellow\\" than their first. Many fans expected it to be equally hard-hitting, but as a consequence were disappointed. At the same time, there was nothing explicitly Christian about the record, unlike the first, and so many stricter \\"Christian music only\\" fans stopped listening to Philmore at that point. After that, they kept touring, but their fame began to fade.

It was the eighth annual SummerSlam event on August 27, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The main event that was for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship competed between Diesel and King Mabel. Diesel retained the championship, pinning Mabel after performing a clothesline off the second rope. There were three matches on the undercard that had more build-up than other matches: The Undertaker defeated Kama in a Casket match; Bret Hart defeated Isaac Yankem by disqualification after Yankem and Jerry Lawler attacked Hart while Hart was in the \\"hangman\\" position. The third match on the undercard that had significant build-up was Shawn Michaels versus Razor Ramon in a feud for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. The two faced off in a Ladder match, with Michaels retaining the title. The pay-per-view received a 0.9 buyrate, equivalent to approximately 205,000 buys in 1995 (1.0 equated to roughly 230,000 homes in the domestic market that year). Although this was up on the buyrate for the In Your House 2 pay-per-view which took place the previous month, the buyrate was down on the 1994 SummerSlam event, which received a 1.3 buyrate. Production =Background= SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view, produced every August by World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \\"The Biggest Party of the Summer,\\" it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \\"Big Four\\".Ian Hamilton. Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition (p. 160) It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. 1995 was the eighth event in the SummerSlam chronology. =Storylines= The most prominent feud heading into the event was between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel and King of the Ring, King Mabel (accompanied by his manager and tag team partner, Sir Mo). King Mabel earned his title by winning the King of the Ring tournament. During Diesel's Lumberjack match with Sycho Sid at In Your House 2, King Mabel (who was one of the lumberjacks) intervened, tossing Diesel into the ring steps. Despite Mabel's interference, Diesel kept the title, pinning Sid after a big boot. On the August 7 episode of Monday Night Raw, Diesel faced Sir Mo. Mabel appeared at ringside, distracting Diesel. Moments later, Shawn Michaels came ringside to support Diesel. After Diesel won the match, Mabel attacked him with a clothesline and a leg drop. Mabel then attacked Michaels. On the last Raw before SummerSlam, commentator Vince McMahon interviewed Diesel about his SummerSlam title defense. Halfway through the interview, Davey Boy Smith appeared and suggested he and Diesel team for a match against Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo). During the match, Smith turned on Diesel and sided with Men on a Mission, leading to a three-on-one assault of the champion. Ted DiBiase, Kama's manager during his feud with The Undertaker The feud between The Undertaker and Kama (a member of Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation) began at WrestleMania XI. The Undertaker's manager was Paul Bearer, and Kama's manager was Ted DiBiase. Undertaker was portrayed as the face, and Kama as the heel. At WrestleMania XI, during Undertaker's match with King Kong Bundy, Kama ran out to the ring, attacked Bearer, and stole the urn (an object which, in storylines, gives The Undertaker supernatural power) for DiBiase. Immediately afterward, Kama declared (in an interview with Jim Ross) his intention to melt down the urn. The urn was revealed to have become a gold necklace, first worn by Kama prior to his match with Scott Taylor on the April 10 episode of Raw. On the April 23 episode of Action Zone, The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid, another member of The Million Dollar Corporation. On the May 7 episode of Wrestling Challenge, a black wreath was left at ringside for Kama. Kama attacked the wreath and, after defeating Buck Zumhofe, stuffed part of it into Zumhofe's mouth. Another black wreath was left at ringside for Kama on the June 12 Raw. After defeating jobber David Haskins, Kama again attacked the wreath, only to realise it was a mannequin. Both The Undertaker and Kama participated in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. On the pay-per-view, a black wreath was ringside for the whole of Kama's quarterfinal match with Shawn Michaels, which ended in a draw. Toward the end of The Undertaker's quarterfinal contest with Mabel, Undertaker was thrown into the referee. While the referee was down, Kama interfered by kicking Undertaker in the face. Mabel followed up with a leg drop, pinning Undertaker to win the match. The Undertaker chased Kama backstage after the bout. The two continued to wrestle together in matches at house shows, with the two facing each other in preparation for their SummerSlam bout. Wreaths continued to be left ringside during Kama's matches, and Kama continued to attack them. On the August 21, 1995 Raw, (storyline) WWF president Gorilla Monsoon announced the match between Undertaker and Kama would be a casket match. Shawn Michaels, defended the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Razor Ramon at SummerSlam 1995 An undercard feud involved Shawn Michaels and the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels had won the title by pinning Jeff Jarrett at In Your House 2. At that event, Michaels was also a \\"lumberjack\\" in the WWF Title match between Diesel and Sycho Sid. He performed a double axe handle off the top rope onto Sid on the outside of the ring, helping Diesel retain the title. A few months prior, Sid had powerbombed Michaels three times, after Shawn blamed Sid for costing him the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania XI sidelining him for six weeks with injuries. On the July 24 Raw, Sid vowed revenge on Michaels. That night, commentator Jerry Lawler stated his own desire for a shot at Michaels' title. A match between Sid and Michaels was scheduled for SummerSlam. However, the match was suddenly scrapped soon after. Michaels would now defend the Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match against Razor Ramon, despite a lack of any onscreen buildup. On the August 7 Raw, Michaels attempted to attack Lawler, but was restrained by officials. Michaels wrestled Lawler on the August 14 Raw. Sid attempted to interfere in the match with a clothesline, but Michaels ducked and hit Sid with a superkick. Sid and Lawler regained the upper hand, and Sid chokeslammed Michaels. Razor Ramon ran in and assisted Michaels in clearing the ring of his attackers. Michaels and Razor then had a staredown, which led to a brawl. Razor came out on top. Despite being removed from SummerSlam, Sid was granted a future title shot, against whoever would be champion on the September 11 episode of Raw. Bret Hart, who faced Isaac Yankem at SummerSlam 1995 Bret Hart had been feuding with Jerry Lawler for two years when they met at King of the Ring. Hart won the match and, per the stipulation, Lawler was forced to kiss Hart's feet, despite Hakushi's attempt to stop it. The following night on Raw, a vignette aired, showing Lawler visiting his dentist, Isaac Yankem, D.D.S., to have his teeth cleansed of foot smell. Yankem revealed to Lawler he used to be a professional wrestler. This began a storyline of Lawler attempting to avenge his loss to Hart. Over the following weeks, more vignettes from Yankem's office aired. They showed him treating his patients, while Lawler asked them which wrestlers they liked and disliked. On the July 24 Raw, Hart beat Hakushi. After the bout, Hart assaulted and piledrove Hakushi's manager, Shinja. Yankem and Hart did not have any direct interaction before their SummerSlam match. The WWF Women's Championship feud started on the April 3 episode of Raw. Moments after winning the title from Bull Nakano, Alundra Blayze was attacked by an unknown woman (later introduced as Bertha Faye). The attack sidelined Blayze with a broken nose. Faye, managed by Harvey Whippleman, had her debut match on the April 24 Raw, squashing La Pantera Serena. Blayze made her Raw return on May 29, stating she was cleared to wrestle in an interview with Vince McMahon. Faye and Whippleman responded with their own interview on the June 3 Superstars of Wrestling. Their SummerSlam match was announced on the August 7 episode of Raw. Event The first match to air was between Hakushi and The 1-2-3 Kid. Hakushi got the early advantage after hitting a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Both wrestlers performed multiple high spots. Late on, The Kid avoided a Diving headbutt, and followed with a series of offensive moves. The Kid attempted to perform his finisher, spinning crescent kick, but Hakushi countered it into the Nenbutsu Bomb and pinned him. Hunter Hearst Helmsley faced Bob Holly in the second match. This was Helmsley's pay-per-view wrestling debut. Toward the end of the bout, Holly gained the upper hand with a series of dropkicks. He attempted to toss Helmsley into the corner, but Helmsley reversed it, then hit his Pedigree finisher and made the pin . The Smoking Gunns (Bart Gunn on the left, Billy Gunn on the right), who faced The Blu Brothers at SummerSlam 1995 A tag team match was next. The Smoking Gunns (Bart Gunn and Billy Gunn) faced The Blu Brothers (Jacob Blu and Eli Blu), with their manager Uncle Zebekiah at ringside. The Blu Brothers held the advantage for the majority of the match, making quick tags to work over Billy. Billy eventually made the hot tag to Bart, who gained the immediate advantage but was booted in the face by Jacob. Bart regained the advantage, pushing Jacob into Eli. The Gunns followed up with their Sidewinder finisher for the pin. Aftermath Lex Luger made his final appearance on WWF TV in the main event (preventing Sir Mo from further interfering). He rejoined World Championship Wrestling the next week. Diesel defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Owen Hart, Yokozuna, and Davey Boy Smith, before losing it to Bret Hart at Survivor Series. The Undertaker's feud with the Million Dollar Corporation ended, and he began to feud with King Mabel. Bret Hart continued to feud with Jerry Lawler and Isaac Yankem until the October 16, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw, where Hart defeated Yankem in a steel cage match.

Event During the Free for All match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Yokozuna, the top rope broke when Yokozuna attempted a Banzai Drop, enabling Austin a guaranteed victory.

Paul Bearer turned on his long-time protege, The Undertaker, to align himself with Undertaker's arch-enemy, Mankind. Vader had originally won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match twice, first by countout (after he press-slammed Michaels onto the guard rail) and then by disqualification (when Michaels struck Vader repeatedly with Cornette's tennis racket), but because WWF championships can only change hands by pinfall or submission, Cornette demanded that the match restart both times.

Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition (p. 160) It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. 1997 was the tenth event in the SummerSlam chronology. =Storylines= SummerSlam 1997 featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines that were played out on Raw Is War and other World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. The featured rivalry heading into the event involved WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. On the July 7 episode of Raw is War at Edmonton, Alberta, Hart was announced as the number one contender for the WWF World Heavyweight Title. In an interview with Vince McMahon, Hart said that if he did not win the title at SummerSlam, he would not wrestle on American soil again. The next week, Shawn Michaels, Hart's nemesis, requested Vince McMahon to be a part of SummerSlam. On the July 21 episode of Raw Is War, Hart, his brother Owen, and his brother-in-law The British Bulldog (The Hart Foundation), challenged three American wrestlers into a flag match. Shawn Michaels was announced as a special referee for the main event at SummerSlam, and in response to the announcement, Hart attacked Michaels and McMahon. Later, the Hart Foundation defeated the American team that contained the Tag Team Champions Stone Cold Steve Austin and Dude Love, with the Undertaker, where the Hart Foundation won thanks to an interference from Brian Pillman. The next week, Hart challenged The Patriot, a match where Hart lost thanks to an interference from Michaels. After the match, the referees prevented Hart from attacking Michaels while the Undertaker watched from the entrance ramp. A predominant feud entering the event featured WWF Intercontinental Champion Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. On July 6, on the Canadian Stampede pay-per-view, Hart managed to pin Austin in a five-on- five match. The day after it, Austin attacked Hart while he was singing the Canadian national anthem. At the same night, Austin told Vince McMahon that if he did not win the title from Hart at SummerSlam, he will kiss Hart's ass. The next week, Austin teamed up with Dude Love to win the vacant tag team titles in a match with Hart and the British Bulldog. On the July 21 episode of Raw Is War, Hart's team managed to defeat Austin's team at a three on three flag match. The next week, Hart attacked Austin during a tag team championship match against The Godwinns, counting him out. After the match, Austin attacked Hart. Another rivalry heading into event featured the WWF European Champion The British Bulldog and Ken Shamrock. The two were at opposing teams of the Canadian Stampede pay-per-view. On the July 14 episode of Raw Is War, the Bulldog said that if he lost at SummerSlam, he would eat a can of dog food right after the match. The next week, the Bulldog attacked Shamrock during a match with Vader, powerslamming him on the steel ramp, and making him lose the match via countout. The next week, Bulldog and Shamrock competed in an arm wrestling contest, but as Shamrock was about to win, the Bulldog headbutted him, hit him with a steel chair and poured a can of dog food over him. Aftermath During the Intercontinental title match, Owen Hart delivered a botched piledriver that temporarily paralyzed Austin and left him with many years of neck issues, forcing him to retire at age 38 in 2003. Austin has since stated that his neck is in good shape and he is in zero pain after a successful neck surgery in 2000. The accident was a source of backstage conflict between the two men, but Austin ultimately forgave Hart, and paid tribute to him on Raw Is War the night after Hart fell to his death at Over the Edge (1999).

At first the besieging force was commanded by Krum's brotherRunciman, pp. 62-63 (whose name is not mentioned in the primary sources). The khan himself went on with an army to Constantinople. After an unsuccessful Byzantine attempt to murder him ruined all prospects for negotiations with them, Krum ravaged much of Eastern Thrace and then turned against Adrianople which was still under siege. The city‚Äîone of the most important Byzantine fortresses in Thrace‚Äîheld out for a while despite being attacked with siege engines.

Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 516 U.S. 233 (1996), is a United States Supreme Court case that tested the extent of software copyright.. The lower court had held that copyright does not extend to the user interface of a computer program, such as the text and layout of menus. Due to the recusal of one justice, the Supreme Court decided the case with an eight-member bench that split evenly, leaving the lower court's decision affirmed but setting no national precedent. Background information Borland released a spreadsheet product, Quattro Pro, that had a compatibility mode in which its menu imitated that of Lotus 1-2-3, a competing product. None of the source code or machine code that generated the menus was copied, but the names of the commands and the organization of those commands into a hierarchy were virtually identical. Quattro Pro also contained a feature called \\"Key Reader\\", which allowed it to execute Lotus 1-2-3 keyboard macros. In order to support this feature, Quattro Pro's code contained a copy of Lotus's menu hierarchy in which each command was represented by its first letter instead of its entire name. Borland CEO Philippe Kahn took the case to the software development community arguing that Lotus's position would stifle innovation and damage the future of software development. The vast majority of the software development community supported Borland's position. District Court case Lotus filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 2, 1990, claiming that the structure of the menus was copyrighted by Lotus. The district court ruled that Borland had infringed Lotus's copyright. The ruling was based in part on the fact that an alternative satisfactory menu structure could be designed. For example, the \\"Quit\\" command could be changed to \\"Exit\\".Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 202 (D.Mass.1993) Borland immediately removed the Lotus-based menu system from Quattro Pro, but retained support for its \\"Key Reader\\" feature, and Lotus filed a supplemental claim against this feature. A district court held that this also constituted copyright infringement. Circuit Court case Borland appealed the decision of the district court arguing that the menu hierarchy is a \\"method of operation\\", which is not copyrightable according to 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 102(b). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the district court's decision, agreeing with Borland's legal theory that considered the menu hierarchy a \\"method of operation\\". The court agreed with the district court that an alternative menu hierarchy could be devised, but argued that despite this, the menu hierarchy is an uncopyrightable \\"method of operation\\".Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 815 (1st Cir. 1995) > We hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an uncopyrightable ‚Äúmethod > of operation.‚Äù The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which > users control and operate Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3. If users wish to copy material, for > example, they use the ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù command. If users wish to print material, they > use the ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù command. Users must use the command terms to tell the > computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users would not be > able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus 1‚Äì2‚Äì3's functional > capabilities. The court made an analogy between the menu hierarchy and the arrangement of buttons on a VCR. The buttons are used to control the playback of a video tape, just as the menu commands are used to control the operations of Lotus 1-2-3. Since the buttons are essential to operating the VCR, their layout cannot be copyrighted. Likewise, the menu commands, including the textual labels and the hierarchical layout, are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3.Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 817 (1st Cir. 1995) The court also considered the impact of their decision on users of software. If menu hierarchies were copyrightable, users would be required to learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for every program, which the court finds \\"absurd\\". Additionally, all macros would have to be re- written for each different program, which places an undue burden on users.Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 818 (1st Cir. 1995) =Concurring opinion= Judge Michael Boudin wrote a concurring opinion for this case. In this opinion, he discusses the costs and benefits of copyright protection, as well as the potential similarity of software copyright protection to patent protection. He argues that software is different from creative works, which makes it difficult to apply copyright law to software. His opinion also considers the theory that Borland's use of the Lotus menu is \\"privileged\\". That is, because Borland copied the menu for a legitimate purpose of compatibility, its use should be allowed. This decision, if issued by the majority of the court, would have been narrower in scope than the \\"method of operations\\" decision. Copying a menu hierarchy would be allowed in some circumstances, and disallowed in others.Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 819-21 (1st Cir. 1995) (Boudin, J., concurring) Supreme Court case Lotus petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment due to an evenly divided court, with Justice Stevens recusing. Because the Court split evenly, it affirmed the First Circuit's decision without discussion and did not establish any national precedent on the copyright issue. Lotus's petition for a rehearing by the full court was denied. By the time the lawsuit ended, Borland had sold Quattro Pro to Novell, and Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet had emerged as the main challenger to Lotus 1-2-3. Impact The Lotus decision establishes a distinction in copyright law between the interface of a software product and its implementation. The implementation is subject to copyright. The public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (for example, the appearance of an icon). However, the set of available operations and the mechanics of how they are activated are not copyrightable. This standard allows software developers to create competing versions of copyrighted software products without infringing the copyright. See software clone for infringement and compliance cases. Lotus v. Borland has been used as a lens through which to view the controversial case in Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc., dealing with the copyrightability of software application programming interfaces (APIs) and interoperability of software. Software APIs are designed to allow developers to insure compatibility, but should APIs be found to be copyrightable, that could drastically affect the development of software.

It came into being in 1921 when the government of newly independent Mongolia issued a resolution declaring the establishment of \\"The Institute of Literature and Scripts\\", which was later upgraded into \\"The Institute of Sciences\\" and \\"The Institute of Sciences and Higher Education\\". In 1961, it was finally reorganized as \\"The Mongolian Academy of Sciences\\" MAS. At present there are 10 research institutes, centers, two affiliated academies and one library under MAS. Status The law \\"on the Legal Status of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences\\" ratified by the State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia promulgated the Mongolian Academy of Sciences as the central scientific thinktank, whose aim is to develop science and advanced technology in the country. The Mongolian Academy of Sciences is a civil self-governed non-commercial organization. Organization General Assembly of MAS, the Presidium and President of MAS constitute management bodies of MAS. =General Assembly= The activities of the Academy in its present form are governed by the law \\"on the Legal Status of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences\\" of May 1996. The Supreme governing body of the Academy is its General Assembly consisting of all national Academy members. The General Assembly sets forth the direction of the Academy's activities and supervises their execution. Between sessions of the Assembly (which takes place twice a year) the Presidium of the Academy takes responsibility for all strategic issues. The Presidium is composed of the President, four Vice Presidents (two of them are part-time), Secretary-General and other Presidium members. The General Assembly addresses the following issues: # the development policy of science and technology, outcomes of scientific projects, methods for technology transfer and assisting the Government in science and technology policy, # to assess and evaluate the economic and social development issues of Mongolia, advise the Government the Parliament and the President of the country on decision-making, # determines the principal directions and priorities of MAS fundamental research, # approves the MAS Presidium Report on scientific achievements by MAS and scientific research work done by the Presidium since the previous election of the Academy members. # elects the Academy President, Vice Presidents and Secretary-General for a term of four years. =President and Presidium= The Presidium of MAS is a permanent collegiate body of MAS management. The MAS Presidium reports to the MAS General Assembly; the Presidium presents to the General Assembly a report on the most important resolutions adopted during the period between the MAS General Assembly sessions. The President of the Academy acts as the science and technology adviser to the Prime Minister and the President of Mongolia. =Affiliated academies= There are two affiliated Academies to MAS. They are the Academy of Medical Science and the Agricultural Academy. =Academic sub-assemblies= The academic sub-assemblies are the principal scientific and research organization center that unites the MAS members specializing in one or several related fields of science. It comprises the research institutes, organizations, scientific councils and committees. There are five academic sub-assemblies: Sub-Assembly of Biology, Sub-Assembly of Geology and Geography, Sub-Assembly of Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry, Sub-Assembly of Social Sciences and Sub-Assembly of Technology. The principal objectives of the MAS academic divisions are to develop fundamental research by the scientific subdivisions, coordination and analysis and forecast of the scientific development and to provide methodological guidelines to the institutes within the Sub-Assembly. Academic Sub-Assemblies establish and publish the field-specific scientific journals. The Academic Sub-Assemblies address following issues: # discuss the progress and the results of scientific research conducted within each scientific sub-assembly; # discuss, assess and evaluate project final reports and submit them to the appropriate organizations; # discuss and evaluate scientific publications, proceedings, books and research materials to be submitted for publication. International cooperation International cooperation plays an important role in improving science and technology, training of talents, upgrading experimental conditions, and exchanging information. As Mongolia lies at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, MAS has cooperative arrangements with scientific organizations in Europe and Asia. The Mongolian Academy of Sciences is a national member of the International Council for Science (ICSU), Association of Academies of Sciences in Asia (AASA), Science Council of Asia (SCA) and The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). At present, the Mongolian Academy of Sciences has established formal contacts with over 100 national academic and research organizations on more than 30 countries, in addition to various kinds of cooperative arrangements on mutually interested areas. In 1982, the Mongolian Academy of Sciences published the text of the Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet in the Mongolian language.Udo B.

(accessed 5 October 2014) Voter turnout was 90.1%, the highest since independence. Background The ruling United Democratic Party (UDP) was widely perceived as incompetent, incapable of governing and riddled with corruption. Crime and unemployment rose while a number of government projects were universally panned. After winning nationwide municipal elections in 1994, they had lost two other municipal votes in 1996 and 1997. The PUP capitalized on the people's anger to present a manifesto of far-reaching proposals which they claimed would \\"Set Belize Free\\". Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel advised Governor General Sir Colville Young to dissolve the House of Representatives on 13 July 1998. The House stood dissolved with effect from 15 July 1998. Election day was set for 27 August 1998. Nomination day was 11 August 1998; five political parties nominated 79 candidates, with three independents contesting. One controversy as the election date drew near was Attorney General Dean Barrow's rushed appointment of Manuel Sosa to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on 19 August to replace the ailing George Singh, just days before the election. Then-opposition leader Said Musa objected to this last minute appointment, and after his party took power was able to have it overturned on the grounds that he had not been properly consulted on the appointment as required by the constitution. The National Alliance for Belizean Rights, which had run in coalition with the UDP in the previous election, chose to run on its own despite its sole member in the House, Philip Goldson, standing down. The party failed to win any seats and was not a factor in the election. Results The PUP won 26 of a possible 29 seats, the most lopsided general election win since independence. Several high-ranking UDP members went down to defeat, most notably Esquivel himself in Caribbean Shores. Only Barrow in Queen's Square and Michael Finnegan in Mesopotamia retained their seats for the UDP, while Erwin Contreras narrowly defeated the PUP's Amin Hegar in Cayo West for the UDP's third seat.General Elections 1998, Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission.

Their works, many of which are now considered classics of the sh≈çjo genre, are noted for their examination of radical and philosophical issues, including sexuality and gender. Though the origin of the name is unknown, it refers to the fact that the artists belonging to this group were born around Sh≈çwa 24 (1949). The mangaka most commonly associated with Year 24 Group are Moto Hagio, Yumiko ≈åshima, and Keiko Takemiya. Other manga artists associated with the group include Toshie Kihara, Ryoko Yamagishi, Minori Kimura, Riyoko Ikeda, , and . History Hagio and Takemiya were roommates in ≈åizumigakuench≈ç, Nerima, Tokyo from 1970 to 1973. Norie Masuyama, a friend of Takemiya's, introduced Hagio and Takemiya to Barazoku, the first commercially-published gay magazine in Japan. The magazine inspired Takemiya and Hagio to create sh≈çnen-ai works. Masuyama, Takemiya, and Hagio were all roommates in an apartment later dubbed the \\"≈åizumi Salon\\" and compared to Tokiwa-s≈ç, another apartment that housed many mangaka. Influence Year 24 Group contributed significantly to the development in sh≈çjo manga by expanding the genre to incorporate elements of science fiction, historical fiction, adventure fiction, and same-sex romance. The prevalence of Bildungsroman genre conventions in their works have been noted by critics. Stylistically, Year 24 Group created new conventions in panel layout by departing from the rows of rectangles that were the standard at the time, creating borders that were softened or removed entirely, and panel shapes and configurations that conveyed emotion. Comiket, the world's largest comic convention, was founded by the d≈çjinshi circle to study the works of various manga artists, including Hagio and other members of Year 24 Group. Hagio's They Were Eleven was included in the first anthology of sh≈çjo manga translated into English, Four Sh≈çjo Stories, published in North America by Viz Media in 1996. Academic Tomoko Yamada has criticized the use of the term \\"Year 24 Group\\", noting that the designation lumps women together based on their age, that it may perpetuate a bias against earlier sh≈çjo manga artists, that it is overly inclusive of all female baby boomer manga artists, and that some manga artists considered part of Year 24 Group may reject the label.

It is located 10 km east of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, and 13 km southwest of Aalen. The town finds itself at the edge of the Rems River Valley and at the base of the Swabian Alps. Heubach is located in the Swabian region of Germany. Residents speak the Swabian German dialect. The town is bordered to the north by B√∂bingen an der Rems and M√∂gglingen, to the east Essingen, the south by Bartholom√§ and the west by the city of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. History Heubach was first mentioned in 1234 in association with knight Hainricus de H√¥bach. Rosenstein Castle which is located on Rosenstein mountain was first mentioned in 1282. At the end of the 13th century, Heubach and Rosenstein came into possession of the Counts of Oettingen, before it fell to the Counts of W√ºrttemberg from 1358 onwards. Subsequent to the victory of Emperor Charles IV over Eberhard II, Count of W√ºrtemberg, in 1360 Heubach and Rosenstein fell to the Kingdom of Bohemia. However it was transferred back to W√ºrttemberg in 1377. In 1413 Heubach was enfeoffed to the Barons of Woellwarth fiefdom. Georg von Woellwarth left the spur castle on Rosenstein mountain in 1524 and built a castle in Heubach. In 1579 Duke Ludwig von Wuerttemberg purchased Heubach and Rosenstein and chartered Heubach by granting town privileges. The town hall was built in 1581. In the course of the Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648, Heubach was nearly wiped out and population fell to around 10 people, but due to efforts of W√ºrttemberg's government it was rapidly rebuilt and resettled. On April 25, 1807 Oberamt Heubach was merged with Oberamt Gm√ºnd. With the municipal reform of 1938 Oberamt Gm√ºnd was transformed into Landkreis (district) Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. In the course of the district reform of 1973, Heubach now belongs to the Ostalbkreis district. Above the town of Heubach, the remains of Rosenstein Castle are still visible. The castle ruin on top of the Rosenstein mountain can be considered Heubach's landmark and is a popular tourist spot due to its impressive views over the region. On Glasenberg there is a telecommunication tower of reinforced concrete with an observation deck that also gives nice views over the area.

Museums Since 1974 there is an undergarment museum that was set up in cooperation with the companies Triumph and Susa-Werke GmbH, which is the only museum of its kind in Germany. At Heubach's police station there is a \\"Police Museum\\", which originated from a private collection of a police officer. There, items from the local police are displayed that date back to 1853. The museum opens by appointment only. =Religion= In addition to a Protestant and a Roman Catholic church there is also a Baptist and Jehovah's Witnesses congregation Mayors In 2011 the jurist Frederick Br√ºtting was elected to be the successor of Klaus Maier (* 1956).

Disciplinary isolation within medicine was viewed as particularly problematic by the Macy Foundation, and given that their mandate was to aid medical research, they decided to do something about it.von Foerster, H., Mead, M., & Teuber, H.

L. (Eds.). (1951). Cybernetics: Circular causal and feedback metchanisms in biological and social systems. Transactions of the seventh Conference. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, p. 7  Overview  The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation developed two innovations specifically designed to encourage and facilitate interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary exchanges; one was oral: the Macy conferences, and one was written: the Macy transactions (published transcriptions of the conferences). Macy conferences were essentially conversations held in a conference setting, with participants presenting research while it was still in process (rather than after it had been completed). These were more formal than conversations (papers were prepared ahead of time and circulated) but less formal than conferences. Macy transactions were transcriptions widely circulated to those who could not attend. These were far more informal than typical proceedings, which publish revised versions of conference papers, and served to invite additional scholars into the exchange. The explicit goal was to let a wider audience hear the experts exchange ideas and think out loud about their own work.Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation (1955). \\"The conference program\\". Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation 1930-1955: A review of activities. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. p. 23. But even participants themselves found the transactions valuable, as a way to prompt memories, and to catch comments they might have missed.Schaffner, B. (Ed.). (1956). Group processes: Transactions of the second conference. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, p. 13. A few comments were made explicitly referring to later publication of the conference discussions, so clearly participants took this into account. However, Fremont- Smith explicitly stated that actual discussion should always take priority.von Foerster, H., Mead, M., & Teuber, H. L. (Eds.). (1950). Cybernetics: Circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems. Transactions of the sixth conference. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, pp. 9-10. Participants were leading scientists from a wide range of fields. Casual recollections of several participants as well as published comments in the Transactions volumes stress the communicative difficulties in the beginning of each set of conferences, giving way to the gradual establishment of a common language powerful enough to communicate the intricacies of the various fields of expertise present. Participants were deliberately chosen for their willingness to engage in interdisciplinary conversations, or for having formal training in multiple disciplines, and many brought relevant past experiences (gained either from earlier Macy conferences or other venues). As participants became more secure in their ability to understand one another over the course of a set of conferences on a single topic, their willingness to think outside their own specializations meant that creativity increased.von Foerster, H., Mead, M., & Teuber, H.

The Cybernetics were particularly complex as a result of bringing together the most diverse group of participants of any of the Macy conferences, so they were the most difficult to organize and maintain. The principal purpose of these series of conferences was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind. These were one of the first organized studies of interdisciplinarity, spawning breakthroughs in systems theory, cybernetics, and what later became known as cognitive science. One of the topics spanning a majority of the conferences was reflexivity. Claude Shannon, one of the attendees, had previously worked on information theory and laid the one of the initial frameworks for the Cybernetic Conferences by postulating information as a probabilistic element which reduced the uncertainty from a set of choices (i.e. being told a statement is true, or even false, completely reduces the ambiguity of its message). Other conference members, especially Donald MacKay, sought to reconcile Shannon's view of information, which they called selective information, with theirs of 'structural' information which signified how selective information was to be understood (i.e. a true statement might acquire additional meanings in varied settings though the information exchanged itself has not changed). The addition of meaning into the concept of information necessarily brought the role of the observer into the Macy Conferences. MacKay argued that by receiving and interpreting a message, the observer and the information they perceived ceased to exist independently of one another. The individual reading and processing the information does so relative to their preexisting internal state, consisting of what they already know and have experienced, and only then acts. MacKay further muddled the role of information and its meaning by introducing the idea of reflexivity and feedback loops into his thought experiment. By claiming that the influence of the original message on the initial observer could be perceived by a separate individual, MacKay turned the second individual into an additional observer which could be elicited to react just how the initial observer did, a reaction that could then further be observed by a nested doll of observers ad infinitum. Reflexive feedback loops continued to come up during the Macy Conferences and became a prominent issue during its later discussions as well, most notably in the discussions regarding behavioral patterns of the human mind. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also attendees, had previously worked on designing the first mathematical schema of a neuron based on the idea that each neuron had a threshold level that was to be reached, via excitation signals from incoming neurons, before firing its own signal onto others. Similarly to how Shannon had previously proven with his work in relay and switch circuits, McCulloch and Pitts proved that neural networks were capable of carrying out any boolean algebra calculations. At the Macy Conferences, McCulloch proposed that the firing of a neuron can be associated with an event or interaction taking place in the external world which provides sensory stimulus that is then picked up by the nervous system and processed by the neurons. But McCulloch also showed how a neural network's signal pathway could be set up reflexively with itself causing the neurons to continuously fire onto each other in a 'reverberating' circular feedback loop without any original 'firing' signal or any new additional incoming signals. McCulloch claimed this accounted for conscious phenomena in which individuals' world view, or the reaffirmation of their senses' perceived external stimulus, was cognitively distorted or all together missing as seen in individuals with phantom limb syndrome (claiming to feel an arm that has been amputated or lost) or hallucinations (perceived sensory stimulus without an original external signal). Lawrence Kubie, another attending conference member and a psychiatrist, noted how repetitive and obsessive behaviors manifesting themselves in neurotics bore a resemblance to the behavior enacted by McCulloch's 'reverberating' loops. Shannon had developed a maze-solving device which attendees of the Macy Conferences likened to a rat. Shannon's 'rat' was designed and programmed to find its marked goal when dropped at any point in a maze by giving it the ability to recall on past experiences, previous paths it had taken around the maze, so as to help it reach its endpoint - which it did repeatedly. Though goal-oriented, Shannon showed how his rat's design was prone to erratic behavior that negated its original function entirely via reflexive feedback loops. If Shannon's rat encountered itself in a path in which its 'memory' failed to fire correctly, that is to recall the paths which lead it to its goal, it would get stuck in an endless loop chasing its tail. Completely abandoning its goal-oriented design, Shannon's rat had seemingly become neurotic. The Macy Conferences failed to reconcile the subjectivity of information (its meaning) and that of the human mind but succeeding in showing how concepts such as that of the observer, reflexivity, black box systems, and neural networks would have to be approached in conjunction and eventually overcome in order to form a complete working theory of the mind. The Macy Conferences were discontinued shortly after the ninth conference. :*First Cybernetics Conference, 21‚Äì22 March 1946 :*Second Cybernetics Conference, 17‚Äì18 October 1946 :*Third Cybernetics Conference, 13‚Äì14 March 1947 :*Fourth Cybernetics Conference, 23‚Äì24 October 1947 :*Fifth Cybernetics Conference, 18‚Äì19 March 1948 :*Sixth Cybernetics Conference, 24‚Äì25 March 1949 :*Seventh Cybernetics Conference, 23‚Äì24 March 1950 :*Eighth Cybernetics Conference, 15‚Äì16 March 1951 :*Ninth Cybernetics Conference, 20‚Äì21 March 1952 :*Tenth Cybernetics Conference, 22‚Äì24 April 1953 Participants: (as members or guests) in at least one of the Cybernetics conferences: Harold Alexander Abramson, Ackerman, Vahe E.

They are of particular interest due to the element of reflexivity: participants were interested in their own functioning as a group, and made numerous comments about their understanding of how Macy conferences were designed to work. For example, there were a series of jokes made about the disease afflicting them all, interdisciplinitis.,Schaffner, B. (Ed.). (1957). Group processes: Transactions of the third conference. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, p. 10 or how multidisciplinarian researchers were neither fish nor fowl.Schaffner, B. (Ed.). (1955). Group processes: Transactions of the first conference. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, p. 307. When Erving Goffman made a guest appearance at the Third conference, he explicitly prefaced his comments by saying that his ideas were partly speculative, and Frank Fremont-Smith responded by stating that their goal was to discuss ideas that had not been crystallized.Schaffner, B.

History Denkendorf is first mentioned in a document of 1129 in which Pope Honorius II took the monastery of Denkendorf under his protection. During the construction of the Autobahn (A8 today) in 1935, a series of Alemannic burial sites was uncovered, which are dated in the period shortly before 700 A.D. Denkendorf in 1683, Forest book Andreas Kieser Denkendorf-Abbey After the end of World War II, the population soared, quadrupling from 1945 to 1995. Despite the district and municipal reform of 1973/74 Denkendorf maintained its independence. Crest The coat of arms is a golden Lorraine cross with a golden letter D to the left and to right, all on a solid royal blue background. Twinning Denkendorf has been twinned with the city of Meximieux in France (near Lyon) since 1986. The twinning involves summer camps, annual festivals, tournaments and student exchanges. Economy and Infrastructure =Transportation= From 1926 to 1978 Denkendorf was connected by the tram Esslingen-Nellingen-Denkendorf with the county town of Esslingen am Neckar. In Nellingen there is also access to the lines U7 and U8 of the Stuttgart light rail. Sulzbachbr√ºcke under construction Stuttgart-Wendlingen high-speed railway The national road 10 (B 10) can be accessed via the K√∂rsch valley or the Nellingen ring road in a few minutes and connects with Stuttgart, Esslingen, Plochingen and G√∂ppingen. The Bundesautobahn A8 leads south past the town. It connects Stuttgart with Munich and Karlsruhe. The two nearest junctions are to the East - Wendlingen (just 10 min.) and to the West - Neuhausen (5 min.) Also in the municipal district is the Sulzbach viaduct that leads the Autobahn over the eponymous river. The Stuttgart Airport can be reached in less than 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, the UDP had been in apparent disarray since 1991, when a group led by longtime Area Rep. Philip Goldson broke with the party to form the National Alliance for Belizean Rights over disagreements on how to handle the longstanding Belizean‚ÄìGuatemalan territorial dispute. This all compelled Prime Minister George Price to call elections nearly 18 months early (they were not constitutionally due until at least December 1994). With Price's move the UDP and NABR promptly sought a coalition to achieve victory at the polls. However, Goldson was the NABR's only successful candidate. Although the PUP won a majority of votes nationwide, the UDP/NABR coalition won a slim majority of seats and therefore formed the next government. The election would be Price's last as PUP leader after over 35 years. He was succeeded as party leader in 1996 by Said Musa. Results The results were extremely close in several constituencies. In Caribbean Shores and Stann Creek West the UDP‚ÄìNABR candidates won by 40 and 34 votes. The UDP‚ÄìNABR candidate in Cayo North won by 18 votes.

Long known from subfossil bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on the former island, but only assumed from descriptions to also have been present on the latter, remains have more recently been found on R√©union also. Early travellers' reports from Mauritius were, in reverse, generally assumed to refer to common moorhens, but it seems that this species only colonized the island after the extinction of the endemic coot. Description Mascarene coot compared to a red-knobbed coot and a Eurasian coot, 1872 The Mascarene coot was a large bird and while not flightless, it had reduced flying ability, so that if pursued, it would have even more preferred to escape by diving than it is already a general habit of the coots. As the bird had considerable stamina, it could have easily crossed the ocean between the islands, explaining why a single species occurred on both islands. The birds looked like oversized Eurasian coots, being about 45 cm long, but as they were more likely derived from the red-knobbed coot, it is not clear whether the distinguishing red knobs (which are easily overlooked) on top of the white frontal shield were not present or simply not reported by Dubois, who described the species in some detail in 1674 as \\"Waterhens which are as large as fowls. They are always black, and have a large white crest on the head.\\" Extinction All terrestrial Rallidae species on the Mascarene islands originated in Madagascar and were victims of cat predation which led to a decline in population however the primary cause of extinction was over hunting. There is one extant Rallidae species, the Eurasian Moorhen Gallinula chloropus pyrrhorrhoa that colonized the islands after the extinction of the Mascarene Coot. Dubois is the last author to mention the coot on R√©union. In 1667, Fran√ßois Martin had already complained that hunters had killed off the population on the Etang de Saint-Paul, although the bird was generally considered to be of disagreeable taste: The species fared little better on Mauritius, with Leguat being, in 1693, the last to record the endemic poules d'eau, saying they were \\"already rare\\". Apart from hunting, settlement activity leading to destruction of the marshland habitat seems to have played a major role in the species' extinction.* Leguat, Fran√ßois (1708): Voyages et Avantures de Fran√ßois Leguat & de ses Compagnons, en Deux Isles Desertes des Indes Orientales, etc. 2: 71.

He was the 24th Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Education, ordination, early ministry Browning received his seminary education from the University of the South, commonly known as Sewanee. While there he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1952, followed by the postgraduate Bachelor of Divinity in 1954. On July 2, 1954, he was ordained to the diaconate. His ordination to the priesthood took place on May 23, 1955, in the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas. He was married to Patricia Alline Sparks on September 10, 1953. Together they had five children; Mark, Paige, Philip, Peter, and John. Browning began his ministry as a priest in Corpus Christi, Texas as an assistant at the Church of the Good Shepherd from 1954 to 1956, followed by a period as the Rector of the Church of the Redeemer in Eagle Pass, Texas from 1956 to 1959. Japan and Europe In 1959, Browning and his wife moved to Okinawa and began what would become a 12-year span in Japan. He was priest-in-charge of All Souls Church, Okinawa, until 1963 when he and his wife went to Kobe to study at the Language School; they remained in Kobe until 1965. On returning to Okinawa, Bishop Browning served at St. Matthew's Church in Oruku until 1968. On January 5, 1968, Browning was consecrated the first Missionary Bishop of Okinawa. He remained in that post until May 16, 1971, when he left Japan for Nice to assume the post of Bishop of the Convocation of American Churches in Europe. At the time of his appointment to the European See by Presiding Bishop John Hines, he was the first active, full-time bishop to be appointed to the post. Previously the position had been occupied by various diocesan bishops. As bishop in Europe, Browning had jurisdiction over Episcopal churches in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy and France. Browning oversaw the closing of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit in Nice, in connection with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from France. The congregation merged with a Church of England parish, Holy Trinity, in Nice. The Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, commonly known as the American Cathedral in Paris, had become the seat of the Bishop-in-charge in 1922, but for various reasons, Browning chose not to move to Paris but lived in Wiesbaden, Germany. Return to the United States Browning returned to the United States in June 1974 to work at the Episcopal Church Center in New York City as Executive for National and World Mission on the Executive Council of the Church. In 1976, he was elected Bishop of Hawaii and was installed at the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, Honolulu on August 1 of that year. He was the second Bishop of Hawaii since the Missionary District of Honolulu was granted status as a diocese in 1969. Overall, he was the sixth bishop since 1862 when Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley arrived in Honolulu at the invitation of Hawaii's King Kamehameha IV. Browning succeeded Bishop E. Lani Hanchett, who had died in office the previous year at the age of 56. Presiding Bishop On September 19, 1985, Browning was elected to succeed the Most Reverend John Maury Allin as Presiding Bishop at the General Convention held in Anaheim, California. His election to the 12-year term came on the fourth ballot of the House of Bishops and was ratified overwhelmingly by a voice vote of the House of Deputies. Shortly after his election, Browning said of his vision for the Episcopal Church, \\"There are tremendous global issues that face us all. My hope is that the Church can continue to hold these issues before the full membership, as well as society, to bring about some well-being for all. I think the Church has a role in being both prophetic in holding up issues, and using all its influences to try to bring about better conditions for the poor, the hungry, both in this country as well as in the global village.\\" He also said, \\"‚ÄúI want to be very clear: This church of ours is open to all ‚Äî there will be no outcasts ‚Äî the convictions and hopes of all will be honored.\\" On January 16, 1986, Browning was installed in Washington National Cathedral as the 24th Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church. During his sermon, he began to address the deepening rift within the church over issues such as the ordination of women and homosexuality, by saying, \\"(do not ask me) to honor one set of views and disregard the other. I may agree with one, but I will respect both...the unity of this church will be maintained not because we agree on everything but because -- hopefully -- we will leave judgment to God.\\" Browning's theologically liberal views earned him both admiration from progressives and intense criticism by the conservative wing of the church, and the rift, primarily over whether openly homosexual clergy may be ordained and whether gay and lesbian couples' unions may be blessed by the church, grew during his tenure. The tensions broke into a personal public exchange at the 1991 General Convention in Phoenix, Arizona, during a session of the House of Bishops, between the conservative Bishop John H. MacNaughton of the Diocese of West Texas and Bishop John Spong of the Diocese of Newark, prompting Browning to call for an unusual closed session of the bishops. Browning also supported the adoption of a pro-choice stance on abortion by the Episcopal Church at their 71st General Convention in 1994, the first taken by an Anglican Communion province.Where the churches stand, Pregnant Pause The last year of Browning's term was shadowed by a financial scandal when it was revealed in May 1995, that Ellen F. Cooke, the former treasurer of the ECUSA, had diverted $2.2 million to her own use. Cooke was national treasurer from her appointment by Browning in 1988 until he forced her to resign in January 1995 due to her abrasive management style. The diversions, which were uncovered after her departure, are thought to have started in 1990. The revelation of embezzlement caused particular resentment because Cooke had implemented budget cuts and staff layoffs at the same time that she was living a lavish lifestyle financed, in part, on embezzled funds. Cooke had unusual power because she served as both treasurer and chief administrator. Browning admitted that Cooke's embezzlement had gone undetected because she had \\"absolute control over auditing\\" and had prevented any outside checking of accounts. Browning forcefully rejected calls that he resign for not exercising proper oversight over Cooke. Cooke was convicted and served five years in prison, and the church recovered all but $100,000 of the embezzled funds. During his final year as Presiding Bishop, his book A Year of Days with the Book of Common Prayer was published. Retirement Browning retired on December 31, 1997, and was succeeded by the Most Reverend Frank Griswold. He and his wife Patti made their retirement home in Oregon, where they farmed blueberries in the Hood River Valley. Browning died on July 11, 2016. His funeral was on July 19, 2016 at Trinity Cathedral in Portland.

The gameplay is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates \\"sub spaces\\" of a larger \\"world map.\\" Gameplay takes place between different subspaces. This game was released in Japan as . Gameplay The plot centers around a lone pilot in a spacecraft attempting to protect a transport ship, the CosmoStation Noah, full of planetary refugees from a fleet of intergalactic terrorists known as the Molok Wardrivers. The player's primary goal is to eliminate all enemy fleets before they can surround the stationary CosmoStation Noah. The player may also visit up to eight different planets in search of engine and weapon upgrades for their ship, may seek repairs at up to five space stations in addition to CosmoStation Noah, and may also visit an asteroid field, and a black hole from which escape is impossible. The game is won if the player defeats the enemy armada and safely returns to base. However, the game is lost if the enemy fleet reaches the CosmoStation Noah, the player enters the black hole, the player's ship runs out of fuel crystals, or if life support fails. Gameplay occurs on a 10x10 grid that is randomized at the start of each game with the exceptions of the player and CosmoStation Noah which will always begin in the top left, and the five initial Molok Wardriver fleets will begin in the bottom right. To progress through the grid, the player must select their destination coordinates either through the HUD or the select menu grid, and hold down the B button to charge enough power to travel to as many sectors as required to reach their destination, as identified by the number on the bottom-center of the HUD. The number of leaps charged is indicated by icons in the upper-left gauge. As gameplay progresses, additional fleets may join the Molok Wardriver armada. Any planets or space stations they encounter during their trek to the CosmoStation Noah will be destroyed, limiting the resources the player will have to mount an attack. In order to destroy the enemy fleets, the player must warp to their coordinates and destroy the fleet's spacecraft and mothership, which will endlessly deploy enemy spacecraft as long as it remains operational. The player must raise their shields in the select menu in order to minimize damage taken to the ship. The player's fuel crystals will deplete normally over time, and faster during warping or sustaining damage. Therefore, it is necessary to visit space stations to refuel to prolong gameplay. They can also repair damaged systems which include radar, engines, and weapons, but a malfunctioning life support system can be repaired only at the CosmoStation Noah. Depending on the amount of damage taken, the engines may become inoperable, one or both laser cannons can malfunction, and radar can become difficult to use.

In 1950, KCBC purchased the former WHO-FM transmitter and tower on top of the Equitable Building at 6th and Locust in downtown Des Moines. Format The format that KCBC-FM adopted was an Easy Listening format that was targeted at people riding the city's buses. At the rear of KCBC's Grand Avenue property there was a barn where they installed FM receivers in the city's buses. The plan to target music and advertisements to the city's bus riders was not a profitable one, and after just four years, KCBC-FM left the air, donating their transmitter to the Des Moines Public Schools. The school district used the transmitter to put KDPS on air the same year at 88.1 FM.

Created and introduced by show creator William J. Bell in November 1973, Cooper's Katherine was introduced in an effort to increase the show's struggling ratings. When Bell's plan proved successful, Cooper was signed to a contract. Cooper went on to become the longest-running cast member in the show's history, ending her nearly 40-year run on May 3, 2013, five days before her death. Throughout Katherine's history, a majority of her storylines have focused on her controversial and chaotic relationship with Jill Abbott. The feud is one of the longest-running feuds in the history of American soap operas. The rivalry was ignited by Jill's affair with Katherine's husband, Phillip Chancellor II, and how Katherine's attempt to win back his affections leads to his death. After Phillip's death, the women fight over Jill and Phillip's son, Phillip III, as well as numerous other men including Katherine's husband, Rex Sterling. A 2003 plot twist leads to Katherine and Jill believing they are mother and daughter; however, this plot is undone in 2009 by head writer Maria Arena Bell and Katherine is given another son, Tucker McCall. Cooper is regarded as an icon of the genre, with some critics believing her character and performance are chiefly responsible for the soap opera's success and longevity. She is also famed for having her own facelift performed onscreen in 1984, as Katherine gets the same procedure within the story. It is referred to as daytime television's first \\"extreme makeover\\". Casting The character was introduced by Bell, after he was disappointed with the series' weak ratings, and hired Cooper as a quick fix to add controversy to the storylines. In 2010, Cooper said she was called in by producer John Conboy for the role, who thought she was \\"such a good actress\\" and \\"hoped she would be interested in daytime\\". The actress signed a three-year contract and expected to depart after its expiration, but became a crucial character. Beverly Garland substituted for Cooper in the role in January 1981 for a few days when she fell ill. Gisele MacKenzie briefly substituted for Cooper for six episodes in August 1986. Cooper also appeared as Katherine on The Bold and the Beautiful for two episodes on October 31 and November 1, 2005. In 2005, Cooper was awarded with the Daytime Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2008, after several years of being nominated, Cooper received the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress. In 1989, Cooper won Soap Opera Digest's Editor's Award along with the award for Outstanding Lead Actress. In October 2011, it was announced Cooper had taken a medical leave, and the role was temporarily recast with Michael Learned. Shortly after, it was announced Cooper had returned to work, reclaiming the role on December 23, 2011. Cooper's final appearance as Katherine aired on May 3, 2013, five days before her death. Development =Characterization= Katherine has been referred to as \\"The Dame of Genoa City\\" and \\"The Duchess\\". Cooper has said every time she goes to work, she \\"assumes somebody is watching for the first time.\\" The actress has said a longtime fan became attached to the character \\"because with all her money, she still had the same problems they did‚Äìit's just nicer to go through it all with money!\\" Cooper has also said she felt it was \\"so smart\\" for the show to start Katherine off as a drunk, \\"because that has given her such a range of personality traits to express over the years.\\" In 2012, she felt Katherine had been \\"pretty dumb\\" because she had been acting as a minister, also stating the character becoming a minister was \\"funny\\". Afterward, she told the producers, \\"Fun is fun, but Katherine is not a minister!\\" =Feud with Jill= Jill and Kay's infamous \\"cake catfight\\" in 2009. Katherine is known for her rivalry with Jill Foster Abbott which has lasted for nearly four decades, becoming the longest rivalry on any American soap opera. Their storyline has included believing they were mother and daughter for years, though it was proven false. On the rivalry, BuddyTV wrote: \\"Nothing spells rivalry like the on-going feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor.\\" Of working with Brenda Dickson who originated the role of Jill, Cooper said: \\"Brenda had as much fun with the Katherine/Jill relationship as Jess and I did. When there was the 'Who Killed Phillip?' storyline and our characters were in court, and being thrown about, a faction of fans lined up at CBS with posters marching, and this group flew in from the east coast. And they were pro- Brenda. Then, I in turn said to her, 'Well all these people must have gotten pregnant by someone else‚Äôs husband.' They had to get us out of the studio because we had death threats! They would say that I or she 'deserved to die.' Oh, the studio was very quiet about that, and they had police stand there. It was wild!\\" In 1993, Katherine was diagnosed with breast cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: \\"Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by.\\" Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: \\"I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. She is funny and sharp and I love her.\\" A writer from the Jamaica Gleaner noted fans have been getting restless with Jill's newfound closeness to Katherine, writing: \\"Katherine and Jill are at their best when they are at each other's throats.\\" Cooper has said of the storyline where she returned to Jabot: \\"Since I went back into the business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [Walton] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'\\" Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between women has \\"outlived most marriages.\\" Cooper stated: \\"The audience - both young and old - relate to the Kay/Jill relationship\\". Walton describes their relationship as \\"incredible\\" and said: \\"The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. It used to be, ‚ÄúThis month I like her... this month I hate her.‚Äù Now, it‚Äôs more from moment to moment.\\" =Death= Jeanne Cooper died on May 8, 2013. On May 28, the series dedicated an entire episode to Cooper in which those closest to her reminisced about their time with her. Executive producer Jill Farren Phelps also revealed that in addition to the memorial tribute for Cooper, the writers would also incorporate Katherine Chancellor's death into the series. Throughout most of the summer, Katherine being off screen is explained as being off on vacation with her husband, Murphy. Phelps denied rumors the show was planning to recast and revealed Kay's exit would be \\"as dramatic and meaningful as possible\\". Phelps said the ramifications of the character's death would be big, especially in regard to what would happen with the character's company, Chancellor Industries. However, Phelps could not comment on what would happen to the iconic Chancellor Mansion set. It was revealed that Katherine's last words were adlibbed by Cooper herself. Cooper's real life son, Corbin Bernsen, officiated Katherine's memorial as Father Todd. Cooper's co-star, Daniel Goddard, revealed on Facebook that filming for Katherine's memorial began on July 16, and was slated to air on September 3 and 4. Entertainment Weekly later revealed Katherine's death would be acknowledged on August 16, 2013. Despite Katherine's family and friends being blindsided as they initially come to welcome her home, a fight immediately ensues over her fortune. Storylines =Background= Katherine is the daughter of Army intelligence officer, Walter Shepherd, and his wife. She was born on October 25, 1928 in Genoa City. Katherine attends high school with several Genoa City residents including best friend, John Abbott, and his future wife, Dina. Katherine is even named godmother to their daughter, Ashley. After her graduation from Genoa City University, Katherine marries her high school and college classmate, Gary Reynolds. They have a son, Brock in 1952. Upon Gary's death, Katherine takes control of his business, and eventually turns the company over to her new husband, and Gary's college roommate, Phillip Chancellor II. Phillip Chancellor II was deeply rooted in the history of Genoa City, which was founded by Phillip's great-great- grandfather Civil War hero Garfield Dandridge Chancellor.The Young and the Restless Special Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition p.196 Family Trees, The Chancellors Garfield Chancellor's company built many of the early buildings in Genoa City, which are now considered historical landmarks, but the show begins with Phillip Chancellor II running Chancellor Industries.The Young and the Restless Special Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition p.156. This turn of events does not sit well with Brock who skips town with Lorie Brooks, the daughter of Katherine's high school classmate, Stuart Brooks. =1973‚Äì1998= When Katherine is first introduced, she and Phillip have been married for 12 years, but the marriage is crumbling due to Katherine's drinking. After discovering Phillip's affair with Jill (Brenda Dickson), she convinces Brock (Beau Kazer) to romance Jill. However, Phillip files for divorce when he learns Jill is pregnant with his child. In August 1975, after Phillip returns from obtaining a divorce, Kay tries to win him back and ends up driving their car off a cliff. Phillip dies after a deathbed wedding to Jill. To honor Phillip's memory, Katherine decides to get sober. In the late 1970s, Katherine falls for Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue), who tricks her into marriage, despite his love for Jill. However, in exchange for staying in the marriage, Katherine would set up a $100,000 trust fund for Jill's son, Phillip Chancellor III. When Derek's ex-wife, Suzanne Lynch, drugs Kay and sends her to the sanitarium, Kay is presumed dead in a fire. Derek and Jill marry only for Katherine to show up at the wedding to reclaim her fortune, and her husband. Katherine put her faith in Derek and put him in charge of Chancellor Industries; however, when the company begins to fail, she hires Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) to take Derek's place. Katherine later becomes godmother to Victor and Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott)'s daughter, Victoria. In an attempt to save her marriage, Katherine and Derek go on a cruise. However, after realizing her marriage is over, Katherine jumps over board and is taken hostage by her savior, Filipe Ramirez. They fall in love and she divorces Derek for Filipe. In 1984, Katherine went under the knife for a facelift with her close friend, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), by her side despite her feud with Jill, Liz's daughter. Katherine later romances tennis pro, Brent Davis, the former lover of Dina Abbott. When Brent discovers he is dying and decides to tell Ashley he is her biological father, Dina and Katherine fail to talk him out of it. An angry Dina tries to kill Brent, but accidentally shoots Kay; however, she quickly recovers. When Katherine discovers Jill's affair her husband John's son, Jack (Terry Lester), she exposes them which leads to John having a stroke. In May 1986, when Jill is shot, Katherine is one of the suspects. Katherine and Jill then battle over Phillip III (Thom Bierdz). To cope, Phillip turns to drinking. With help from Katherine and Jill, he gets sober. After Phillip's supposed death in 1989, Katherine and Jill team up to take custody of Phillip Chancellor IV from Phillip III's widow, and get back Phillip's fortune. However, Nina wins that battle. Jill later hires conman, Brian Romalotti, aka Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to romance Katherine and steal her fortune, but the plan backfires when the duo actually falls in love and marry. Later, Rex's former cellmate, Clint Radison finds Marge Cotrooke (also played by Cooper), who is a dead ringer for Kay and switches her with the real Katherine. Turned off by his wife's behavior, Rex divorces \\"Katherine\\" for Jill. With Rex gone, Clint begins selling off Katherine's assets, starting with the company. However, Brock returns and rescues his mother and her maid, Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) exposing the scheme. However Katherine and Marge form a bond Katherine helps gets Marge released from prison, realizing she was innocent. Katherine and Rex eventually remarry when he fakes a heart attack. Katherine later becomes the godmother and namesake to Esther's daughter, Katherine Valentine aka Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson). To help Esther impress her love interest Norman Peterson (Mark Haining), Katherine and Rex agree to pretend to be Esther's servants. With encouragement from Norman, Esther convinces Kay to put her in her will. However, Norman is unwilling to wait for Katherine's death, and breaks into the safe. Rex discovers him and Norman shoots and kills him in late 1994. Katherine forgives Esther and includes her in her will once again. =1998‚Äì2005= In July 1998, Jill discovers a letter from Phillip II leaving the Chancellor Mansion to her. Jill tries to evict Katherine who finds a legal loophole which results in Katherine and Jill being forced to share the house. Jill nearly drives Katherine to drink again; instead, Katherine runs off and contemplates suicide. Lost and broke, after being robbed, Katherine is taken in by a homeless girl, Mac (Ashley Bashioum). Katherine is shocked when Mac is revealed to be her granddaughter, Brock's daughter from an affair during his time in India. Kay brings Brock to town and reunites her family by moving them into the estate. When Brock leaves town, Katherine petitions for sole custody of Mac from her mother, Amanda Browning (Denice Duff). When Amanda reveals she has also run away from her husband, Ralph Hunnicutt (Angelo Tiffe, Daniel Quinn), Katherine convinces her to move into the mansion. Ralph shows up to cause trouble and the two eventually leave town together. In 2003, Katherine and Jill are mortified when they are mistakenly led to believe they are mother and daughter. The revelation forces Mackenzie to end her marriage to Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Ryan Brown) due to them being cousins. Jill and Katherine eventually form a bond, despite their feud still remaining as intense as ever. Katherine begins having nightmares about giving away a baby, believing she gave Phillip away at birth to a woman named Violet Montgomery, and gave Jill another child who was raised as Phillip Chancellor III. The baby turns out to be Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), who had recently \\"married\\" the scheming Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz). However, Katherine forgives Amber and they eventually become close friends. =2005‚Äì2013= In 2005, Cooper appears as Katherine on The Bold and the Beautiful when she is approached by Massimo Marone (Joseph Mascolo) who introduces her to Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), the daughter of Katherine's old business acquaintance, John Douglas. Katherine is revealed to be the true owner of Forrester Creations, thanks to a trust set up by Stephanie's father. Katherine helps Stephanie reclaim the company from her estranged husband, Eric Forrester (John McCook). In 2008, Katherine has a minor stroke while secretly trying to help Marge - who has recently returned - get into rehab. In November of that year, Katherine and Marge get into a car accident on the way to the rehab center. Katherine is mistaken for Marge and pronounced dead at the scene. Kay is rescued by Marge's friend, Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), believing she is Marge. Katherine regains her memories and convinces Murphy to take her home. However, Jill is hesitant, believing Katherine is really Marge, a belief that is affirmed when Katherine fails several test comparing her and Jill's DNA. Despite this, Katherine convinces her closest friends, including Victor and Nikki, to believe her identity. Meanwhile, Katherine and Murphy become engaged. When Katherine's DNA matches Brock's and doesn't match Jill's, it is confirmed that they are not related, leaving Jill devastated. Katherine and Murphy are married in May 2009. In the summer of 2009, it is revealed Cane is not Jill's son, but a man hired by the real Phillip who faked his death because he was gay. Katherine becomes an ordained minister to marry Amber and Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei). Katherine later decides to take Chancellor Industries public only for her to become the victim of a hostile takeover by Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols), who is revealed to be her biological son; the child Jill was supposed to be. Despite a rocky relationship, Katherine rushes to Tucker's side when he ends up in a coma and is given control of his company, McCall Unlimited. Katherine is shocked to discover Tucker has been searching for his son, and decides to pick up the search. In the meantime, Katherine stops Tucker's attempt to buy up shares of Victor's company, Newman Enterprises, and even fires his executive, Sofia Winters (Julia Pace Mitchell), and Ashley from Jabot. Tucker recovers and takes back his company while Katherine learns Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the adopted son of her close friend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), is actually Tucker's son. After Tucker fires Devon from his record label, Katherine launches a label under 'Chancellor Industries and puts Devon in charge. When Tucker steals Jabot out from under Katherine, she has a stroke and the truth about Devon's paternity is revealed. Both father and son are furious with her, but she and Devon eventually begin to work through their differences. When Tucker goes along with another scam allowing everyone to believe Victor is dead, Katherine writes him out of her will and leaves his share to Devon. When Jack takes control of Newman Enterprises and steals Neil away from Chancellor, Katherine comes out of retirement to run her company on her own. Katherine begins suffering from lapses of memory and Jill blames her new assistant, Adriana Stone (Jhoanna Flores). However, it is eventually revealed Katherine has a brain tumor, and Katherine makes Cane keep the secret while she undergoes surgery. The tumor is benign. Katherine steps down as CEO and names Cane as her successor much to Jill's dismay. Katherine last appears telling Jill goodnight after a welcome home party. Katherine and Murphy then embark on a three-month-long vacation to several locations where they send postcards to her relatives instructing them to meet her at the mansion on August 16. Jill is shocked to realize the places on the list are on Katherine's bucket list. Murphy returns and tells everyone Katherine died in her sleep following a reunion with Tucker on August 1. Katherine leaves Jill a mysterious letter, while she encourages Nikki to track down the child she gave up as a teenager. After Katherine's funeral, she appears to Jill and Nikki smiling. Katherine instructs her family and friends to celebrate her life, instead of mourning her death. In the meantime, she leaves Devon the remainder of her estate, amounting in $2.45 billion. Reception  Katherine is considered a daytime television icon, described as \\"the matriarch of all soaps\\". Some critics have said that Cooper's performance as Katherine has contributed to the show's success and longevity. HuffPost TV ranked her at number four on \\"The 15 Most Memorable Female Soap Opera Characters Ever\\", with Michael Maloney writing:  References  Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1973 Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional socialites Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Katherine Chancellor"},{"id":"5677113","title":"List of Members of the Canadian House of Commons with military service (E)"},{"id":"5677123","title":"A Million in One, Two, Three"},{"id":"5677127","text":"Miracle in the Andes (in Spanish \\"Milagro en los Andes\\") is a 2006 non-fiction account of a rugby team's survival on a glacier in the Andes for 72 days by survivor Nando Parrado and co-author Vince Rause. It was published by Crown. Story Nando Parrado co-wrote the 2006 book Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home, with Vince Rause. In Miracle in the Andes, Nando Parrado returns to the events described in Piers Paul Read's 1974 book, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors (which tells the story of the people, most of whom were part of a Uruguayan rugby team consisting of alumni of Stella Maris College (Montevideo), who were on Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which crashed into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972). When what little food they had run out after ten days, those still alive agreed that after their death the others should eat their bodies to survive. Piers Paul Read's version was published two years after the rescue and was based upon interviews with the survivors. Miracle of the Andes, however, is told from Nando Parrado's point of view 34 years later. Reception Publisher's Weekly wrote that it is \\"more than a companion to the 1970s best-selling chronicle of the disaster, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, this is a fresh, gripping page-turner that will satisfy adventure readers, and a complex reflection on camaraderie, family and love.\\" The Library Journal found the book to be, \\"more introspective than Piers Paul Read's journalistic account, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors...Parrado presents both the jaw- dropping realities of the 16 survivors' story and the life-altering lessons he learned from the experience\\" . Jon Krakauer, the author of Into Thin Air, said the book is \\"an astonishing account of an unimaginable ordeal\\".The quote by Jon Krakauer is a \\"blurb\\" found on dust-jacket of the first edition.

The album pays tribute to the pioneers of Surf music like Brian Wilson, Jan and Dean, the Belairs, the Hondells, the Surfaris, the Ventures, Beach Boys, Dick Dale and many others. The album was produced by Terry Scott Taylor who also wrote the majority of the songs which were all recorded exclusively for this album. Nearly every track on the album teams up multiple artists or bands who then join forces to deliver their best tribute to the genre. In some cases, the artists attempt to mix other styles of music with surf music, such as The Insyderz on \\"A Good Sailor Knows,\\" where the artists attempt to blend their own style of Ska music with Surf. The overall result, according to CCM Magazine, was a sound more like a \\"unified record\\" than a compilation.

A criminal jurist, Gross made a mark as the creator of the field of criminality. Throughout his life, Hans Gross made significant contributions to the realm of scientific criminology. As Gross developed in his career as an examining justice, he noticed the failings of the field of law. His book, classes, institutions, and methods helped improve the justice system through his experience as a justice.  Early life and career  Gross was born on December 26, 1847 in Styria, Austria. As a young adult, Hans Gross graduated in 1870 as a jurist (Examining Justice) from his hometown's university in Upper Styria. His education resulted in two decades of learned knowledge in law. Gross served as the Examining Justice of Styria in which he served as a judge and prosecutor for all crimes presented to him. During his service, he dealt with several fraudulent charges. It was during this job that Gross realized the many shortcomings of the present justice system. Back then, the Examining Justice stood as a criminal investigator. During this time, there were very few crime investigators. Many of the law officers were volunteers or ex-police officers. As a result, jurists mainly solved and prosecuted all crimes brought before them. This proved to be a poor system as many of the magistrates relied on their personal knowledge and limited facts or evidence. This lack of organization led to Gross's active work in criminal science.  Academic impact  During his life, Gross did much to establish several institutions regarding criminology. Gross mainly did this by reiterating the practice of criminal forensics. He taught and developed several institutions that furthered the influence of the field of criminology. Throughout the years, Gross taught and engaged in constructive debate while professor at Chernivtsi University (1897 to 1902), Prague University (1902 to 1905), and the University of Graz (1905 to 1915). Later in 1898, he established the Institute of Criminology of Graz. On August 1898, he began to teach criminal law in which he presented the field of criminalities. However, many people opposed this idea developing into a study, claiming that it did not serve true beneficial value except to those involved in the justice system. Despite opposing views, Gross established the field of criminalities, branding him forever as the ‚ÄúFounding Father‚Äù of criminal profiling.  Contributions to criminology  Gross noticed the faults in the justice system early on in his career. His efforts focused on expanding deep investigation, professional ethics, and the scientific method. He defined criminal psychology from a technical viewpoint, considering it as pure research. Along with studying a person's behaviors, Gross stressed the use of careful judgement due to often misleading evidence. His view of research, technical evidence, and methods also led to the creation of the \\"crime scene.\\" Relating the concept of the crime scene, Gross explains the necessity of balancing emotion with evidence and evidence with logic. Gross fully introduced the concept of criminalistics in 1893, a period in which the notion of criminology expanded. The concept of criminalistics is divided into two branches: crime and political science. Even though Gross found a new way in which the justice system functioned, many believed the field of criminalistics proved useless, except for examining justices. However, Gross still contributed in furthering criminology for other magistrates in law. He called for the objective use and examination of evidence. He stressed the importance of a judge remaining neutral in cases. He did this, mainly, by presenting new concepts in the examination of crime scenes, such as crime scene photography, fingerprints, microscopy, and X-rays.  Criminal Investigations, a Practical Textbook  Gross's book was written to cover philosophical and systematic aspects of criminology. In 1893, his book Criminal Investigations, a Practical Textbook (Handbuch f√ºr Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik) was published. The purpose of the book was to make up for a deficiency in criminalistics. He wrote it as an instructive book, focusing on human nature and the motives of a criminal. He presents his theories through psychological and material elements. Gross especially expanded on body language and the importance of the judge and the witness involved in a criminal case. He observes the behaviors of murderers, arsonists, thieves, and counterfeiters. Gross strongly focuses on the failings and inconsistencies of the judges and witnesses, the importance of materialistic evidence, and relating facts with reason. He believed that the study of psychology allowed one to understand the motives of criminals. Also, he relates chemistry, physics, botany, secret codes, and the use of blood to further determine facts and motives. He believed an overall education in these studies proved beneficial, especially to judges and investigating officers.  Summary  Hans Gross made his mark in the world as a criminologist. He is associated with being the creator of the field of criminology after establishing the study at the Institute of Criminology in Graz. Throughout his life, he assisted in advancing the crime investigation world, especially in 1893 when the practice of criminology became more widespread. Introducing new investigation and observation techniques, such as crime scene photography and examining fingerprints, changed how the justice system functioned. His book, Handbuch f√ºr Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik, contains revolutionary methods and ideas that greatly broadened criminal science. In memory of all of his work, stand many institutions formed because of him.  References  Literature * Sergij Neshurbida, M. P. Djatschuk, R. W. Sabadasch, N. M.

The test is an important measurement of pressure behaviour at the drill stem and is a valuable way of obtaining information on the formation fluid and establishing whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. History Working in El Dorado, Arkansas, in the 1920s, E.C. Johnston and his brother M.O. Johnston developed the first drill stem tester and ran the first commercial drill stem test in 1926. In April 1929, the Johnston Formation Testing Corporation was granted a patent (U.S. Patent 1,709,940) and they subsequently refined the testing system in the early 1930s.History of Petroleum Engineering, API Division of Production, New York City, 1961, pages 561‚Äì566 In the 1950s, Schlumberger introduced a method for testing formations using wireline. The Schlumberger formation- testing tool, placed in operation in 1953, fired a shaped charge through a rubber pad that had been expanded in the hole until it was securely fixed in the hole at the depth required. Formation fluids flowed through the perforation and connecting tubing into a container housed inside the tool. When filled, the container was closed, sealing the fluid sample at the formation pressure. The tool was then brought to the surface, where the sample could be examined. In 1956, Schlumberger acquired Johnston Testers and continues to perform drill stem tests and wireline formation tests in both open and cased holes. About Drill Stem Testing Drill stem testing is an oil and gas exploration procedure to isolate, stimulate and flow a downhole formation to determine the fluids present and the rate at which they can be produced. The main objective of a DST is to evaluate the commercial viability of a zone's economic potential by identifying productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent of an oil or gas reservoir. These tests can be performed in both open and cased hole environments and provide exploration teams with valuable information about the nature of the reservoir. Drill stem testing involves deploying a series of tools known as a test bottomhole assembly (BHA). A basic drill stem test BHA consist of a packer or packers, which act as an expanding plug to be used to isolate sections of the well for the testing process, valves that may be opened or closed from the surface during the test, and recorders used to document pressure during the test. In addition to packers a downhole valve is used to open and close the formation to measure reservoir characteristics such as pressure and temperature which are charted on downhole recorders within the BHA. Below are two types of BHA DST, Cased Hole which can be applied after the well has been cased, and Open Hole which may be performed before casing. Applications of drill stem testing =Cased Hole stimulation= Performed after the well is cased, cased hole drill stem testing uses a retrievable production packer that is set above the zone of interest. The well is then flow tested through perforations in the casing. The two types of cased hole testing are pressure operated and mechanically operated. =Open Hole= Because it's performed before casing is run, open hole drill stem testing can be the most economical way to determine productive capacity, pressure, permeability or the extent of an oil or gas reservoir. The testing equipment is run into the well and the zone of interest is isolated using inflate or compression-set packers, depending on your requirements and drilling conditions. =Alternate Procedures= Depending on testing objectives and scope of work, drill stem testing may also be performed in combination with various other exploration and completion process such as fluid loss control and well control, closed chamber tests, well stimulation, and a combination of DST and TCP. Procedure During normal well drilling, drilling mud is pumped through the drill stem and out of the drill bit. In a drill stem test, the drill bit is removed and replaced with the DST tool and devices are inflated above and below the section to be tested. These devices are known as packers and are used to make a seal between the borehole wall and the drill pipe, isolating the region of interest. A valve is opened, reducing the pressure in the drill stem to surface pressure, causing fluid to flow out of the packed-off formation and up to the surface. Results In a low permeability or low pressure formation, surface production may not be achieved but the volume and flow rate of fluid can still be analysed within the drill stem.

His position of choice was at prop-forward. Childhood and early career Ritson began playing rugby league at an early age for the Miranda Magpies in the Sutherland Shire and was quickly earmarked as a star player for his advanced skills at such a young age along with his size. He later moved on to rival club the Engadine Dragons before being signed to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at an early age. While attending De La Salle in 1993, Ritson was selected to play for the Australian Schoolboys team. Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks His talent was noticed immediately at the Cronulla club impressing coaches at all levels, including first grade coach Arthur Beetson. Beetson immediately drafted Ritson into the Sharks first grade team while he was still only sixteen years of age in 1993, making him one of the youngest ever first grade players. Ritson then went on to make several appearances over the next three seasons for the club. After impressing all with his talent, skill and size at such a young age and appearing in the Sharks Presidents Cup final victory in 1994, as well as tasting his first representative game with the City Origin side, Adam found himself in the middle of a battle for his signature between the Australian Rugby League and Super League competitions. Ritson decided on staying with the Australian Rugby League, essentially meaning he would have to leave his Cronulla club after they had signed on to become a Super League team making himself a free-agent after the 1995 season. After the Super League war had begun on 30 March 1995 with the rebel competition signing a number of teams and players, it was Ritson who inadvertently alerted the ARL to what was happening. Super League were signing Cronulla players following their win over new team the Western Reds in Perth when Ritson, showing maturity belying his 18 years, balked at signing, stating that he wished to speak to his manager and his parents first. Ritson was then allowed to phone his manager back in Sydney to discuss the SL offer. Following this his manager immediately rang the ARL to inform them what was going on. After talking to his manager (as well as seeking advice from his parents) he then signed with the SL, but was given a 24-hour cooling-off period should he wish to back out of the deal. Ritson ultimately did back out of the deal and would eventually sign with the ARL. Parramatta Eels With his signature being chased after by the majority of ARL clubs Ritson eventually agreed to sign for the Parramatta Eels for the start of the 1996 season. Adam was placed into the Eels starting line-up with immediate effect and after playing just eleven games for his new club struck tragedy in a fixture against the Canberra Raiders. Just two minutes into the game he was knocked unconscious after a dangerous high tackle from Canberra forward John Lomax and with the completion of the game and a routine scan it was discovered he had a life-threatening brain cyst. Ritson then went on to have fourteen operations over the next year, several of which nearly left him dead. Eventually he made a full recovery but was never the same and retired from the game later that year at the age of twenty.http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/man-who-fell-to-earth/news- story/bbc21a865e2a257d884e1987eef6daaa?sv=5426710a57c5b8e97c46c4add07ead03 After his career was effectively over at such a young age a lawsuit was filed by Ritson first against Lomax for the high tackle but was then shifted towards his club the Raiders instead. Eventually the case was settled out of court with Ritson being given a six-figure sum.

The Kensico Reservoir was formed by the old earth and gravel dam, built in 1885, which impounded waters from the Bronx and Byram rivers, and supplied about 18 million gallons daily. The construction of a new masonry dam in 1915, replaced the old dam, and expanded the water supply by bringing water from the Catskill Mountains over a distance of more than 100 miles. It is about 3 miles (5 km) north of downtown White Plains, New York, and about 15 miles (24 km) north of New York City. The reservoir serves mainly to store the waters received from the Catskill Mountains west of the Hudson River. Along with the West Branch Reservoir and Boyds Corner Reservoir, it is one of only three reservoirs within the Catskill/Delaware system outside the Catskill Mountains region. The Kensico Reservoir also provides for fishing and boating recreation. Every year, the reservoir is stocked with over 2,000 brown trout.Trout Fishing in New York According to the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Kensico Reservoir was stocked in April 2016 with 8620 brown Trout long.Spring 2016 Trout Stocking for Westchester County History As the population of New York City grew in the 19th century, so did the need for water. The first use of water from Westchester County came from the old Croton Dam (forming what was called Croton Lake), which was completed in 1842. In the 1880s, the City faced increasing demands for water and therefore needed to enlarge the Croton Reservoir to meet that need. The enlargement of the Croton Reservoir (with the construction of the New Croton Dam and the forming of the New Croton Reservoir) was completed in 1906 as a part of a system of reservoirs designed to bring water from Putnam and Westchester Counties (the Croton Watershed) to New York City. The village of Kensico, New York, was named in 1849 for a Siwanoy Indian chief, Cokenseko, who had sold most of the land surrounding White Plains to English settlers in the 1600s. In 1885, the old Kensico Dam was built south of the village of Kensico, NY as an additional source of water for New York City. The earth and gravel dam formed a small lake from water supplied by the Bronx River and the Byram River, but it was still not enough for the ever-increasing population of New York City. A reservoir was needed that would contain waters from various new reservoirs and act as a holding tank for distribution to New York City. Kensico was surrounded by hills that came to a natural V-shape making it an ideal area to hold a vast amount of water. Just to the south of Kensico was Rye Pond and Little Rye Pond in Harrison, New York, which would eventually form part of the new reservoir. A nearby quarry in Harrison bordering Cranberry Lake, provided the necessary materials for building the new dam. Although Kensico had a population of about 200 people, Kensico had houses, stores, churches, hotels and a railroad station. In 1905, legislation was passed by New York State to allow money to be raised for the building of the Kensico Reservoir. The next year, final planning by the state was approved, and preliminary surveys were started. Seventeen miles of railroad track were privately built to carry materials from quarries at nearby Cranberry and Silver Lakes to the dam site; this spur railroad and a highway network had to be built to move supplies into place. A camp for the workers and their families had to be constructed, along with facilities such as schools for their children. To prepare for the dam construction, each individual lot of land was condemned and appraised, and the owner paid a \\"fair value\\" for the land. Many of the families had to move to such surrounding communities as Armonk, Harrison, Valhalla, and White Plains. The village of Kensico was then flooded to make way for the reservoir. After the events of September 11, 2001 the road running across the top of the Kensico Dam was closed to all automobile traffic, for fear of an attempt to destroy the dam. A breach of the dam would result in a diminished supply of water to New York City and the flooding of many communities in Westchester. On September 11, 2005, a 9/11 memorial was completed and dedicated in the dam plaza. The memorial is dedicated to the 109 Westchester County residents who died in the attack. The roadway was reopened in May 2012 to pedestrian and bicycle traffic only. Dam construction Old Kensico Dam being removed in 1911 Kensico Dam Under Construction in 1915 Before constructing the existing Kensico Dam, the old Kensico Dam had to be removed; this began in 1911. The construction of the dam began in 1913 and was concluded in 1917‚Äîthree years ahead of schedule‚Äîat a cost of more than $15,000,000.The New York Times - \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Valhalla; 40 Minutes From Big City, a Small Haven\\", by Elsa Brenner, September 28 2003 The dam is 1,843 feet (562 m) long. It stands above its foundation and contains of masonry‚Äîas much masonry as the Egyptians used to build some of the pyramids. In one month, 2.5 million cubic yards of concrete were poured into blocks, which had to cure for three months before being swung onto the rising hyperbolic pile of dam. The dam is able to hold back about of water. Frank E. Winsor was the engineer in charge of construction of Kensico as well as Hillview Reservoir and of the Catskill Aqueduct. New York City‚Äôs main contractor built a work camp at nearby Valhalla for the 1,500 men who worked on the dam at the height of construction. The water supply board created a mounted police force to keep order. Crews were largely made up of Italian immigrants, who began the long task of digging straight down to a depth of to reach solid rock with no water-bearing seams. This entailed months of blasting and a number of fatal accidents. As the aqueduct neared completion in 1913, the work gangs at Kensico began laying the first of the concrete bricks of which the dam is built. The tremendous influx of workers provided a period of prosperity for the surrounding area. New stores, rooming houses, hotels, restaurants and saloons met the needs of the workers and their families. Many of the construction families remained in the area after completion of the dam, contributing to the growth and character of Valhalla and its environs. The Kensico Reservoir was acquired as parkland in 1963 from the New York City Watershed Commission and remains the property of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Kensico Dam Plaza is a Westchester County Park. Water sources Kensico Dam Plaza The reservoir is the collecting point for the water from all six reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains: the Ashokan Reservoir, the Cannonsville Reservoir, the Neversink Reservoir, the Pepacton Reservoir, the Rondout Reservoir, and the Schoharie Reservoir. It also receives water from the Croton Falls Reservoir, the Muscoot Reservoir, the New Croton Reservoir, and the West Branch Reservoir through the Catskill and Delaware aqueducts, along with water from Rye Lake. The resulting body of water has a drainage basin of only , and holds of water at full capacity. The reservoir itself provides only 2% of NYC's water supply; the rest of the water comes from the reservoirs to which it connects. The water in the reservoir either provides NYC with water, or it travels down the spillway at the southernmost dam, and continues down the rest of the Bronx River, eventually flowing to the East River. The water that does supply New York City travels down either the Catskill Aqueduct or the Delaware Aqueduct. If it goes down the Delaware Aqueduct, it will pass through Yonkers, and flow through the Hillview Reservoir. It then continues through The Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and then stops at Staten Island. If it flows through the Catskill Aqueduct, It will stop at the Hillview Reservoir, and continue on through The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and then stop at Staten Island. Dam restoration In 2005 the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) announced and commenced a $31.4 million project to rehabilitate the Kensico Dam. The rehabilitation project consisted of reconstructing the colonnades at the ends of the dam; cleaning and repairing all stone masonry surfaces on the dam, reconstructing the lower pavilions, reconstructing the dam‚Äôs downstream terrace, reconstructing the spillway and spillway channel, cleaning the spillway discharge pipe, cleaning the internal galleries, installing new lighting and doors, reconstructing the Upper Gate Chamber, Lower Valve Chamber and Maintenance House, and performing final grading and landscaping towards end of the project.http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/05-31pr.shtml Kensico Dam Rehabilitation Project Begins NYC DEP Press Release 2005 Fishing Kensico Reservoir sustains an active population of gamefish, supplemented by stocking, including brown trout, lake trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, perch, and grass pickerel. The size and depth of the reservoir allow Lake Trout in particular to thrive. Shore fishing is practiced in many areas, and boating is restricted to DEC licensed and inspected aluminum rowboats. No motor-boat of any kind are permitted on the reservoir, nor are recreational watercraft such as kayaks, rafts, or canoes.http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/75444.html In April 2015, the New York was stocked with 8560 brown trout fingerlings, in the Rye Lake section of Kensico Reservoir. The reservoir was formerly stocked with lake trout, however, this program was discontinued after it was determined they had established a sustainable breeding population.http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/23278.html Kensico Dam Plaza The Rising 9/11 Memorial in the Kensico Dam Plaza includes the surrounding areas through its open structure. Modern use of the dam is as a public park. Within the park at Kensico Dam Plaza, Westchester County has public showings of movies.Westchester Cty Website The park provides a unique setting for a wide variety of activities including ethnic celebrations, concerts, antiques shows and arts and craft shows, as well as areas for picnicking, in-line skating, walking and nature study.http://parks.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1904&Itemid;=3751 There are many recreational activities to do at the Kensico Dam Plaza. There is an annual Fourth of July celebration with fireworks, food trucks and live music. Carpooling is heavily recommended for this event due to the crowd that gathers every year. Surrounding streets, such as Columbus Avenue, where many other souvenirs for the public are sold, are closed off due to the mass appeal. Also, there is an annual event named Winter Wonderland, which has food trucks, rides, and other attractions daily like the ice-skating rink. The Plaza provides many opportunities for fun daily recreational activities, such as a playground and an exercise area for hikers. There are also many signs posted throughout the Plaza, encompassing the history of the dam, fun activities for children, and exercise activities. Kensico Dam Plaza is also home to The Rising, a memorial dedicated to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks who were from Westchester County. This memorial displays the names of the victims on the granite surrounding the main structure. The main structure of the memorial is made of steel rods that come together and point to the sky. Visitors can interact with the memorial by going inside the structure. The Rising is where the annual 9/11 commemoration takes place at Kensico Dam Plaza, a ceremony honoring the Westchester residents who lost their lives that day.

It usually contained water for the washing of hands (aqua + manos) over a basin, which was part of both upper- class meals and the Christian Eucharist. Historically the term was sometimes used for any basin or ewer so used, regardless of shape. Most surviving examples are in metal, typically copper alloys (brass or bronze), as pottery versions have rarely survived. Islamic aquamanile from Iran, later used in liturgy by Medieval Spanish Christians Islamic art Persian aquamaniles predate any zoomorphic aquamaniles known in Europe. An Iranian (Abbasid caliphate), Aquamanile in the form of an eagle, bearing the date 180 AH/CE 796-797, of bronze, inlaid with silver and copper, in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, is the earliest dated Islamic object in metalwork.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds). Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands. Works from the State Hermitage Museum and the Khalili Collection. Munich: Prestel, 2004, pp. 80-81. Among the latest in date is one also at the State Hermitage Museum, a late Islamic aquamanile from Khorasan, dated 1206.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands, p. 89, 2004, Prestel, Islamic law deprecated the use of such representational figures, and the Islamic zoomorphic aquamanile tradition died out. The tradition was taken up enthusiastically in Europe, however, where the form remained popular until the Renaissance. Europe Bronze aquamanile in the form of a mounted knight, second half of the 13th century, Lower Saxony The Byzantine Empire's cultural connections with Sassanid Persia and the Abbasid caliphate, never peaceful in the political sphere, nevertheless brought the aquamanile into the Christian Mediterranean world. The earliest European portable aquamaniles date to the eleventh century. Ewers and basins were needed in Christian liturgy for the ritual of the lavabo, in which the officiating priest washes his hands before vesting, again before the consecration of the Eucharist and after mass. As a ritual object, metal was considered more suitable than pottery, although most examples in pottery no doubt were broken and discarded. The aquamaniles made in the Mosan ‚Äì or Meuse valley ‚Äì region, using the brass alloy of silvery tint called dinanderie (from the center of its manufacture in the region of Dinant) were often fantastic and zoomorphic in their forms, which were constrained only by the need for a larger opening for filling the vessel and a spout for pouring. Church records inventory aquamaniles in silver or gilt copper, but the great majority of surviving examples are in base metals, which were not worth melting down. Aquamanile, about 1170/80, (Aachen Cathedral Treasury) As well as the altar, aquamaniles were used at the tables of the great, where extravagant designs of symbolic or fantastical beasts ‚Äì lions were especially popular ‚Äì were developed in purely secular iconography. A gold aquamanile, c. 1215, in the treasury of the cathedral at Aachen, takes the form of a man's bust; it is a rare survival of an aquamanile in a precious metal. An aquamanile (ref. Metropolitan Museum) in the form of Aristotle on hands and knees, being ridden by Phyllis, bore several moral lessons, with ribald undertones; such an aquamanile was distinctly secular in nature. Bronze aquamaniles in the form of leopards were part of court ritual in Benin, where the concept may have arrived from the Islamic north. An 18th-century bronze leopard aquamanile from Benin is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. From the Renaissance elaborate versions of the conventional ewer were preferred to zoomorphic forms. A late version of the aquamanile was the silver-gilt mounted rider on a stand, bought in 1700 for the treasury of the Basilica of St-Denis and sold in 1798. Its form is recorded in an engraving by F√©libien. (ref. St- Denis) The idea of ewers in fantastic shapes has never died out.

In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a trustor, or occasionally, a grantor or donor. Where the trust is a testamentary trust, the settlor is usually referred to as the testator. The settlor may also be the trustee of the trust (where he declares that he holds his own property on trusts) or a third party may be the trustee (where he transfers the property to the trustee on trusts). In the common law of England and Wales, it has been held, controversially, that where a trustee declares an intention to transfer trust property to a trust of which he is one of several trustees, that is a valid settlement notwithstanding the property is not vested in the other trustees.T Choithram International SA and others v Pagarani and others [2001] 2 All ER 492 Capacity to be a trustee is generally co-extensive with the ability to hold and dispose of a legal or beneficial interest in property. In practice, special considerations arise only with respect to minors and mentally incapacitated persons. A settlor may create a trust by manifesting an intention to create it. In most countries no formalities are required to create an inter vivos trust over personal property, but there are often formalities associated with trusts over real property, or testamentary trusts. The words or acts of the settlor must be sufficient to establish an intention that either another person or the settlor himself shall be trustee of the property on behalf of the beneficiary; a general intention to benefit another person on its own is sufficient. These formalities apply to express trusts only, and not to resulting, implied or constructive trusts. For a settlor to validly create a trust, in most common law legal systems they must satisfy the three certainties, established in Knight v Knight: #certainty of intention ‚Äì whether the settlor (or testator) has manifested an intention to create a trust. #certainty of subject matter ‚Äì whether the property identified as being settled is sufficiently accurately identified. #certainty of objects ‚Äì the beneficiaries must be clearly ascertainable within the perpetuity period. Where a settlement of property on a third party trustee by a settlor fails, the property is usually said to be held on resulting trusts for the settlor. However, if a settlor validly transfers property to a third party, and the words used are held not to create a trust, the usual rule is that the donee takes the property absolutely.Lassence v Tierney (1849) 1 Mac & Cr 551 See also *Knight v Knight *Express trust *Offshore trust *Taxation of trusts (United Kingdom) *Trust law Footnotes References Category:Equity (law) Category:Legal terminology Category:Property law Category:Wills and trusts ","title":"Settlor"},{"id":"5677271","text":"Trustor may refer to: *Trustor (trust law), a person who settles property on express trust for the benefit of beneficiaries *Trustor (agent), an entity that trusts another entity  See also  *Trustor affair, an investment company takeover *Trust (disambiguation) * Trustee (disambiguation) ","title":"Trustor"},{"id":"5677312","text":"Chipstead may refer to: * Chipstead, Kent * Chipstead, Surrey ","title":"Chipstead"},{"id":"5677318","text":"Grant Izzard (born in Penrith, New South Wales) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s.

Accessed June 23, 2006 The FM station consisted of block programming of music, including classical, operatic and ethnic music not heard elsewhere in Des Moines. The schedule also included a weekday talk show, \\"Listen While You Work,\\" hosted by his wife, Edith Dunham Webber, and Drake University and high school sports. The station had a huge record library of rare classical and operatic albums. KWDM, located at University Avenue, was never a top performer in the ratings, but it did have a loyal following. Unfortunately, that following was not enough to keep it profitable. In 1968, George Webber sold KWDM to a local group known as the SEQ Corporation. The studios were moved to the Mike Wilson building at 4111 Hubbell Avenue, on the east side of Des Moines. The format went from talk to rock and roll to country music. A controversial talk show, the \\"Hawkeye Nightline,\\" with Russ Lavine, aired Monday-Saturday nights, previously heard on 97.3 KDMI (now KHKI). On Sunday nights, John Birch Society members Jim and Mary Parker hosted that three-hour slot. Country disc jockeys included Bob Neel, Jack Myer and Rex Youngs. National news from the ABC FM Network aired 15 minutes after the hour. On April 10, 1969, the station went dark, after the owners of the tower and transmitter site, John and Jean Murphy, shut down the station due to non-payment of rent. A month later, Webber regained control of the station, operating it at reduced hours. In May 1969, the final selection was played, Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" ballet. Although Webber wanted to bring back the fine music format, he lacked the finances and was too far advanced in his years to make a go of it. The 93.3 frequency went dark for two years until 1971. =Top 40 KYNA= In 1971, the 93.3 frequency came back on the air as KYNA, airing a Top 40 format, competing against the well established KIOA (now KPSZ). KYNA was programmed well and had high-quality DJs. But in the early 1970s, many homes and cars did not have FM radios. KYNA lasted for only about a year when it was sold to the owners of its Top 40 competition, KIOA. =Oldies KIOA-FM= In 1972, KYNA was bought by the Mid-America Broadcasting Company.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-73 Eventually, the call sign was changed to KIOA-FM, and the station became \\"Solid Gold Oldies, KIOA-FM 93.3\\". From 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., the station aired a 1950s oldies format, and simulcasted AM 940 during the remainder of the day. Once again, it was hard to establish a listener base on FM radio in the 1970s, so KIOA-FM also struggled in the ratings. In the early 1970s, KIOA-FM put together a double album of oldies, called \\"Solid Gold.\\" It contained 24 hits and has a board game on the inside of the cover. These collectable records are rare and hard to find. The records were made to help improve KIOA-FM's popularity and bring in some extra cash flow as well. =Magic 93 KMGK= In 1976, the station flipped back to Top 40, this time as \\"Magic 93\\", and with it, a call letter change to KMGK. This was the most successful format to date on the frequency, as the station pulled in good ratings through the late 70s and early 80s. By the mid 80s, KMGK found itself fighting for market share as KRNQ and KLYF began also playing hit music on FM radio. KMGK slipped below both of its competitors and management decided a new format was needed. =Country and Rock hits= An FM station, KJJY, was taking some of the country music audience of KSO's. It seemed like it might be a good idea for 93.3 to also switch to country as it had a stronger signal than KJJY. The owner, Midwest Communications, promoted the change to \\"Hot Country Hits, K93FM.\\" Midwest kept the KMGK call letters for about two years. In March 1986, the station rebranded as KKXI, but it failed to advance in the ratings. On August 1, 1986, the station switched back to Top 40 for a third time as \\"Z93\\" KDWZ, this time using a rock-leaning direction while avoiding titles that sounded Rhythmic or Dance oriented. Competing head on with the better established KRNQ and KLYF once again was not easy. =Oldies return= On October 1, 1990, KDWZ returned to oldies by once again simulcasting KIOA (AM)'s oldies format as \\"All Oldies KIOA\\", along with a callsign change back to KIOA-FM. In 1993, Saga Communications purchased KIOA-AM-FM from Midwest Communications of Iowa, as the simulcast continued, but the branding switched to \\"Oldies 93-3 KIOA.\\" Over time, KIOA-FM's listener base grew and the station became one of the most successful in the Des Moines area. On November 18, 1996, the simulcast ended, with the AM becoming \\"Talk 940 KXTK\\". The call letters then reverted to just KIOA, with the \\"-FM\\" suffix dropped. In the early 2000s, the 1960s music was dropped and KIOA evolved into a classic hits format. The slogan became \\"Iowa's Greatest Hits\\" with KIOA primarily focusing on the music of the 1970s and 1980s. Currently, KIOA has a playlist of music from the 1970s and 1980s, with some 1990s tracks being played as well. =Air-staff changes= On July 31, 2007, Saga Communications announced that it would not be renewing the contract of longtime KIOA morning program co-host, Polly Carver-Kimm. Carver-Kimm had been part of \\"Maxwell and Polly in the Morning,\\" and had also been news director for Saga's other five Des Moines radio stations. Also in July 2007, Dic Youngs, known as \\"Youngsy,\\" announced that he would be retiring from KIOA. He told a local newspaper that it was not his choice to retire. Youngs had been with KIOA, both AM and FM, for over 40 years at the station, often talking about old-times and playing 45 RPM records on air. Dic Youngs retired from KIOA on his 66th birthday on September 30, 2007. He came back to the airwaves part-time on 1350 KRNT. Youngs remained at KRNT until his death on October 1, 2009, at age 68. On July 23, 2008, KIOA announced the addition of former Des Moines morning personality Pam Dixon to the KIOA morning show, joining co-host Maxwell Schaeffer. Dixon said, \\"I feel like the stars have aligned and it was the right time for me to return to broadcasting. I've been a fan of KIOA my whole life and it's MY music.\\" A Des Moines native and Hoover High graduate, Dixon attended the University of Iowa. She was first heard on KRNT and Q-102 before beginning a 10-year run on KLYF which ended in 1996. Maxwell & Dixon were later replaced by Luke & Amy. References External links *KIOA History.

It was created by researchers at the Hamilton Institute in Ireland. H-TCP is an optional module in recent Linux 2.6 kernels, and has been implemented for FreeBSD 7.http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1384609.1384613 Principles of operation H-TCP is a loss-based algorithm, using additive- increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) to control TCP's congestion window. It is one of many TCP congestion avoidance algorithms which seeks to increase the aggressiveness of TCP on high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) paths, while maintaining \\"TCP friendliness\\" for small BDP paths. H-TCP increases its aggressiveness (in particular, the rate of additive increase) as the time since the previous loss increases. This avoids the problem encountered by HSTCP and BIC TCP of making flows more aggressive if their windows are already large. Thus, new flows can be expected to converge to fairness faster under HTCP than HSTCP and BIC TCP. Strengths and weaknesses A side effect of increasing the rate of increase as the time since the last packet loss increases, is that flows which happen not to lose a packet when other flows do, can then take an unfair portion of the bandwidth. Techniques to overcome this are currently in the research phase. The Linux implementation of H-TCP also has an option for avoiding \\"RTT unfairness\\", which occurs in TCP Reno, but is a particular problem for most high speed variants of TCP (although not FAST TCP). Name The algorithm was initially introduced as H-TCP, without mention of what the 'H' stands for. However, it is often called \\"Hamilton TCP\\", for the Hamilton Institute where it was created.

Early years Foley was born in Heckscherville, Pennsylvania to Irish immigrants, Edward and Catherine McDonald Foley. At a young age he decided that he was not going to work the coal mines as his father had done. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1888 for a period of five years. In 1893, he re-enlisted and, in 1898, he was sent to Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War where he received his first taste of military action. He also participated in the Philippines Campaign. Boxer Rebellion In 1900, members of a Chinese nationalist society, known as the Righteous Harmony Society or in contemporary English parlance, \\"Boxers\\", resented the presence of Western foreigners and Chinese Christians on their soil and proceeded to attack them. This became known as the Boxer Rebellion. Hundreds of foreigners were murdered. The British Legation at Peking was under siege for two months and soon after the international settlement at Tientsin was also placed under siege by the Boxers. The small garrison of Marines stationed in Tientsin found themselves under attack and outnumbered by the nationalists, who were determined to \\"drive the foreign devils\\" out. A multinational military force from the Eight-Nation Alliance whose members were Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States and consisting of 50,000 troops were sent to Tientsin to reinforce the troops already there. On June 21, 1900, the Boxers were entrenched on the outskirts of Tientsin. On July 13, 1900, a major skirmish occurred between Foley's unit, the Ninth U.S. Infantry, and the Boxers. Major James Regan was badly wounded and Foley together with Sergeant Clarence Edwin Sutton and two other Marines, under enemy fire and in total disregard for their own personal safety, rescued the Major. They were able to take Maj Regan to a field hospital three miles away from the location where he was wounded. In the letter which Major Regan wrote recommending the Medal of Honor, he stated the following: After serving in the Boxer Rebellion, Foley was sent to the Marine garrison located in Cavite, in the Philippine Islands. There, on May 11, 1902, in the presence of his unit, he was bestowed with the Medal of Honor. Sergeant Sutton and the two other MarinesSix Marines of the 1st Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor for actions on the same date, July 13, 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion: Sergeant John M. Adams (born George L. Day), Corporal Harry Chapman Adriance, Private James Cooney, Sergeant Alexander J. Foley, Private Clarence Edward Mathias, and Sergeant Clarence E. Sutton. were also awarded the Medal of Honor. Medal of Honor citation Puerto Rico Foley was reassigned to the Culebra Naval Station located on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico. On January 14, 1910, Sgt. Alexander J. Foley suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 44. The Department of the Navy did not consider it practical at that time to transfer his body to his hometown, therefore Foley was buried in the municipal cemetery of Culebra, with flags at half mast and with full military honors.

Gameplay and development In-game screenshot In Fighter & Attacker, players control one of sixteen different aircraft as they must complete each of the game's eight areas. Each aircraft are based on real- world fighter jets, including the F/A-18E, F-15J, F-117A, and F-14D. They also have their own unique weapon loadout and playstyles; some are slower but fire more destructive shots, while other are much faster but fire weaker shots. There are no power-ups or screen-clearing bombs. Players also have a heath meter that can sustain three hits before being destroyed. Similar to the Xevious series, the player can launch powerful bombs towards ground targets to destroy them. Some enemies will leave behind captured prisoners when destroyed, which can be picked up for additional points. A boss must be defeated at the end of each level, which increase in difficulty and have more sporadic movement patterns as the player progresses. Known as F/A in Japan, Fighter & Attacker was programmed for the Namco NA-1 arcade board, which supported titles such as Tinkle Pit and Cosmo Gang the Puzzle. The game is notable for its soundtrack, which was composed jointly by Shinji Hosoe and Takayuki Aihara. During production, Namco executives requested that the music be diverse and not sound similar to that in other games of its kind from the time. Hosoe went with a mixture of techno and rave, which for the genre was unheard of during its release. Namco demonstrated Fighter & Attacker at the 1992 Amusement Machine Show exposition in Japan, shown alongside Final Lap 3 and Bubble Trouble: Golly! Ghost 2. It was published in both Japan and North America in October of that year. Reception The arcade magazine Game Machine claims that Fighter & Attacker was the seventh most-popular arcade game of November 1992 in Japan.

The game's plot (and setting) resembled the 1989 film Tango & Cash and Starsky and Hutch. Gameplay The first player's character, \\"Lucky\\", a sophisticated man in a business suit, modeled after \\"Starsky\\" and \\"Tango\\", has to both drive by means of a steering wheel and accelerator pedal, and shoot by means of a lightgun; however, the second player's character, \\"Wild\\", a surfer with long blond hair, modeled after \\"Hutch\\" and \\"Cash\\", just has to shoot by means of a second lightgun. The players must help Lucky and Wild catch six wanted suspects (\\"Jerky\\", \\"Gambit\\", \\"Juliora\\", \\"Keel\\", \\"Bear\\", and \\"Big Cigar\\" himself). As they pursue the suspect for every stage, they must fire at other enemy cars - and they must destroy the henchmen as well as the cars, along with any projectiles fired at them, and obstacles that block them. When they catch up with the suspect, they must continuously fire upon their car until its energy is depleted; if they succeed in doing so, they will have captured the suspect and will receive a reward, but if the stage's timer runs out, the suspect will escape (indicated by the text of \\"got away\\" appearing on the screen). After each stage, Lucky and Wild shall drive onto the \\"Pink Cats Garage\\" to get their car repaired for the next stage, where they will be \\"entertained\\" by young women wearing cats' tails and ears - and the game ends when all six stages are cleared, regardless of how many suspects have been captured. There are also five different ways to play the game: one player driving and shooting with another player shooting, but also one player driving with another player manning the gun, one player driving with another player manning both guns, one player driving, another player manning one gun and a third player manning the second gun, and one single player manning both guns while driving (unofficial), for Namco never manufactured a game that allowed a maximum of three players to play simultaneously. Development Lucky & Wild was the creation of Yutaka Kounoe, a video game designer who joined Namco in 1991. His first project was Tank Force, an arcade sequel to Tank Battalion, later working on the original Point Blank and the Time Crisis series. The company's planning department looked at the arcade industry and noticed that Japanese video arcades were primarily populated by young couples; Namco and Kounoe decided on making a large-scale arcade machine that could be enjoyed by these couples, primarily men. Looking for inspiration, Kounoe noticed the surge in popularity of buddy- cop movies in Japan, such as CHiPS and Police Story; he decided to make the game a homage to these films, as he felt it would make it easy for players to become engaged with a familiar setting. CHiPS was also the source of inspiration for the game's title, as in Japan it was called Joe & Ponch. With an idea in place, Kounoe and the development team began production on Lucky & Wild. Early designs for the game took cues from Sega's Rail Chase, specifically its motion-based seat that reacted based on the player's actions in the game, such as shaking when it ran over rocky roads. Lucky & Wild had this idea originally, rocking violently in a see-saw-like fashion. Namco executives pushed to have the lightguns fire a single shot when the trigger was squeezed, which Kounoe and others pushed against due to it making the game impossible to play. As a way to differentiate it from other games already on the market, and to what Kounoe describes as \\"protect[ing] the pride of the development department, the production team worked to make the game feel fresh and original. Namco's extensive history in the racing game genre, particularly with their Final Lap franchise, allowed the team to build upon those games with their expertise at designing them. Kounoe recalls the toughest part of development to be the controls due to player imbalance. The controls originally were seen as confusing and difficult to implement, leading to long discussions between staff as to how the controls could be made more simplistic and to correct the imbalance. Although 3D racing games were becoming more popular by the early half of the 1990s, Kounoe chose to stick with 2D sprites and used them to create the illusion of a 3D world. The arcade hardware it ran on, the Namco System 2, had strict limitations that made it difficult to work with during production. To figure out how to bypass these setbacks and create the world they envisioned, the team looked to Pole Position for inspiration, which used a clever technique that aligned sprite-based objects alongside the road that made the illusion of a 3D environment. Kounoe implemented this into Lucky & Wild, using realistic arrangements of lampposts, buildings, hedges and billboards to line against the road and create a large sense of depth. These objects and the rate of movement they scrolled past the player were all done by hand, with some minor assistance from Namco's production toolsets. Objects were painstakingly drawn one at a time, with the team using materials like manga and photo albums for reference. It was believed the game was heavily inspired by the film Tango & Cash due to multiple similarities, such as the similar designs of the protagonists and near-identical theme; Kounoe denied this in an interview, claiming that he was unaware of the film's existence during production and that the similarities were merely a coincidence. Lucky & Wild was released in Japan in April 1993, followed by a release in North America a month later. References in other games Lucky & Wild is also borrowed as a fictional American tuning car company brand in the Ridge Racer games with products being muscle cars (similar to those of Danver); the formation of Lucky & Wild protagonists later appeared in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, with one player driving and the second serving as the gunner. Also, in the first episode of the interactive video series Bear Stearns Bravo, Bear Stearns CEO Jackie Dalton refers to the regulators Franco and Henri by the names \\"Lucky & Wild\\". Reception Game Machine claims that Lucky & Wild was the third most-popular arcade game of May 1993 in Japan.

It originated and is based in Poland. Participants All the secondary high school students regardless of the country, type of the school, sex, nationality etc. are eligible for the competition. The only conditions are that the school cannot be considered as a university college and the age of the participants should not exceed 20 years on March 31 (every year March 31 is the deadline for submitting the competition papers). There are no restrictions concerning the subject matter of the papers, their level, methods applied etc. All these are left to the participants' choice. The papers, however, have to have a research character and deal with physics topics or topics directly related to physics. The papers are evaluated by the Evaluating Committee, which is nominated by the Organizing Committee. It was recently won by David Rosengarten. History In the first two competitions, only Polish physicists participated in the Evaluation Committee. In the third competition, one non-Polish judge took part in evaluation of the papers. In the fourth competition, the number of physicists from other countries was 10, with 14 being present in the fifth competition. Plans are in place to increase the number of physicists involved from other countries in future competitions. An International Advisory Committee (IAC) was also established. At present, it consists of 25 physicists from different countries. Competition and evaluation The materials on the competition are disseminated to all the countries via diplomatic channels. The competition is also advertised in different physics magazines for pupils and teachers. (Every year about 30 articles on the First Step are published in different countries). Also, different private channels are used. In the first eight competitions the pupils from 67 countries participated. The criteria used when evaluating the papers submitted are geared towards an adult standard; no special consideration is given for the younger age of the participants. There are no prizes such as would be seen in other school-based competitions (cameras, electronics, financial rewards, etc.). Instead, the winners are invited to the Institute for one month for research stays (usually in November). During the stays, they are involved into real research works going on in the Institute. Each year the proceedings with all of the awarded papers are published. Goals The competition has several aims and interests, which include: *Promotion of scientific interests among young pupils. *Selection of outstanding pupils (this point is especially important in case of pupils from countries or regions in which access to science is difficult) and their promotion (very often winners are sent to better universities and receive appropriate financial help from the local authorities). *Stimulation of the schools, parents, local educational centers, etc. for greater activity in work with pupils interested in research (in some countries, some regions and even in some schools a preliminary local selection in organized, sometime such selections involve great numbers of participants) *Establishing friendly relations between young physicists (in recent competitions, all winners were invited to the Institute at the same time, were accommodated in the same place, and cooperated with each other). Winners In 2007, the winner was an American student. In 2009, the prize went to Mor Tzaban, a high school student from Netivot, Israel. In 2012, the first prize winner was another Israeli teenager, Yuval Katzenelson of Kiryat Gat, who presented a paper entitled \\"Kinetic energy of inert gas in a regenerative system of activated carbon.\\" The Israeli delegation won 14 more prizes in the competition: 9 Israelis students won second prize, one won third prize and one won fourth prize.Kiryat Gat teen wins first prize in international physics competition, Haaretz See also * List of physics awards References External links *Official Website of the First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics Category:Physics awards Category:Polish awards Category:Science and technology in Poland ","title":"First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics"},{"id":"5677445","text":"HMS Swale (K217) was a of the Royal Navy (RN) from 1942‚Äì1955, loaned to the South African Navy for six months at the end of the Second World War.

In March 1943 she was SO (Senior Officer's ship) of the Escort Group (EG) B5, escorting the slow convoy SC 122 from New York to Liverpool. Of the 51 merchant ships in the convoy, 10 returned to port unable to ride a violent storm; three days later another eight were sunk by U-boats. Swale was to have better fortunes two months later. Escorting slow convoy ONS 7 bound for Halifax, Canada, she sank the off Cape Farewell, Greenland on the night of 17 May. The U-boat had earlier torpedoed the steamer Aymeric, the last British cargo ship in the Atlantic to be sunk that month, claiming the lives of 53 men. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander John Jackson, DSC, RNR, Swale moved astern of the doomed Aymeric and made ASDIC (sonar) contact.

Binion is the son of casino magnate Benny Binion and worked for his father at Binion's Horseshoe, a casino and hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Biography  Binion became president of the Horseshoe in 1963 at the age of 26. His stature within the organization grew following the Horseshoe Casino's 1970 hosting of the first World Series of Poker, which would become the largest poker tournament in the world. Privately held, Binion's Horseshoe was one of Nevada's most successful casino operations. In 1998, following a protracted legal battle for control of the Horseshoe among Benny Binion's heirs, Binion sold his interest in Binion's Horseshoe to his sister, Becky Behnen, while retaining a token 1% interest in the operation so that he could lawfully retain his Nevada Gaming License. He also acquired the rights to the Horseshoe brand outside of Nevada. Binion went on to form Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corporation which developed and operated several riverboat casinos under the Horseshoe name. Binion continued to promote the casinos for Harrah's Entertainment following his sale of the company in 2004 to Harrah's. As of 2008, Binion's name appears on the \\"Jack Binion's Steakhouse\\" at Horseshoe Tunica and Horseshoe Hammond and several of the Horseshoe-branded casinos still carry slot machines bearing Binion's likeness called \\"Who Wants To Be A Binionaire?\\" that originated before the Harrah's acquisition. While running Horseshoe Gaming, Binion started the World Poker Open which at one time was a major feeder tournament for the World Series of Poker. Binion was inducted into the American Gaming Association's Gaming Hall of Fame on June 11, 2004. The following year on July 6, 2005 the World Series of Poker, inducted him into the Poker Hall of Fame. In July 2006, Binion became chairman of Wynn Resorts.

A total of eight crews, 60 firefighters in total, worked through the night to control the blaze and by 1:00 AM on Monday morning the fire was finally extinguished. On Bonfire night there were several incidents throughout Scotland in the aftermath of the festival that sparked fires similar to the Trinity School blaze as evidenced by the Strathclyde Fire and Police services, and in addition this gained widespread media attention. During the complete reconstruction of the school, pupils at Trinity High School were temporarily located at the old Holy Cross High School buildings in Hamilton, with a replacement for Holy Cross having already been completed nearby (these have also since been demolished in the South Lanarkshire Schools Modernisation project).

It was released in North America by Atari Games, and was ported to the Sega Genesis in 1991 as Quad Challenge. Players take control of four quad bikes (red for Player 1, white for Player 2, yellow for Player 3, and green for Player 4), which are competing in an \\"off-road\\" race - and they all have a preset amount of time in which to complete a full lap of the track, but for each lap of the track that is successfully completed, the players' time is extended. However, if one of the players cannot manage to successfully complete his current lap of the track before the time runs out, his or her game will instantly be over and the race will continue without him or her; the players must complete between three and six full laps of the track in order to win (the number is dependent on how both of the cabinets are set, as with Namco's own Final Lap). The players can also encounter between four and seven blue CPU-controlled bikes on the track, as the number is dependent on how many people are playing (seven for one player, six for two players, five for three, and four for four). Reception Four Trax is considered to be one of the first off-road racing games for a console system. It was released more than 10 years before ATV Offroad Fury for the PlayStation 2 brought the genre into the 21st century. However, it has become a niche genre again since THQ discontinued their MX vs. ATV series. Even prior to the cancellation of the MX vs. ATV series, driving an ATV around closed-circuit tracks never appealed much to the mainstream audience of gamers. The Sega Genesis version was released with little commercial fanfare, and it never made major sales figures.

In World War II Katz did government research in Washington with a group of social scientist under Rensis Likert, who eventually founded the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. In 1943 Katz went to the Brooklyn College, where he headed the psychology department. From 1947 to 1974 his academic career culminated at the University of Michigan where he was Professor in the Department of Psychology and fellow at the Institute for Social Research. Here Katz cooperated with Theodore Newcomb, who founded Michigan's doctoral program in social psychology and he chaired the program from 1947 to 1953. In honor of both since 1970 the University of Michigan organizes an annual Katz-Newcomb Lecture. Katz was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Psychological Association, the Lewin Award of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Award of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the Award of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Work  Katz produced classic studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of organizational psychology.

She served as the president of the American Academy for Jewish Research from 2004 to 2008. She also was the first female dean of the Seminary College of Jewish Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1981 to 1986. Hyman was a pioneer for gender equality in Jewish religious practice, helping push for women's ordination as Conservative rabbis. During her time, Hyman was one of the most prominent Jewish women‚Äôs activists and her work is still widely read and cited today in the field of Jewish Studies. Jewish Historian Hasia Diner credits Hyman as the originator of the study of Jewish women‚Äôs history.  Early Life and Career (1946-1986)  Hyman was born in Boston, Massachusetts on September 30, 1946 to Ida Hyman (n√©e Tatelman) and Sydney Hyman, two first generation Jewish-Americans from Eastern Europe. Ida was of Russian descent and Sydney of Lithuanian. Hyman was the first of three daughters. Her mother worked as a bookkeeper and was in charge of the home while her father was an office manager. In her childhood household, Jewish culture was integral to family life. Starting in high school and continuing in early college, Hyman studied Hebrew and classic Jewish works at Hebrew Teachers College in Boston, where she earned a Bachelors of Jewish Education in 1966. In 1968 she graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. from Radcliffe College, which was then the sister school of Harvard. While at Radcliffe, Hyman was mentored by Jewish historians Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and Isadore Twersky. After Radcliffe, Hyman went on to do post-graduate work at Columbia University starting in 1972, where she would later be a professor, and earn her Ph.D. in History in 1975. Hyman‚Äôs Columbia doctoral dissertation was titled From Dreyfus to Vichy: The Remaking of French Jewry, 1906‚Äì1939 and was published by Columbia University Press in 1979. The content of her doctoral dissertation focused on Eastern European Jews immigrating to France up until World War II and how that changed French Jewry. This book was a finalist in the National Jewish Book Award competition in History. While in graduate school, Hyman co-authored a book titled The Jewish Woman in America with Charlotte Baum and Sonya Michel. The book earned her another Jewish Book Award in 1998 for Women's Studies. After graduating from Columbia, Hyman was a professor there and later at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. There, she was the first female dean of the Seminary College of Jewish Studies. She served in this position until 1986, when she moved to Yale University.  Later Life and Death (1986-2011)  Over the years Hyman became known as a prominent advocate for gender equality in Jewish religious life, both in her professional and personal lives. At Yale, Hyman was the Lucy Moses Professor of Modern Jewish History and served as the chair of the Program in Judaic Studies for over 10 years. This appointment made her the first woman to head a Jewish Studies program at a prominent university. Over the course of her career Hyman authored ten books and sixty articles. Additionally, Hyman was the President of the American Association for Jewish Research from 2004 to 2008, the co-chair of the academic council of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture from 1995 to 2002, a member of the executive board of the Association for Jewish Studies and the Leo Baeck Institute, while being on the editorial board for various journals including Association for Jewish Studies Review, Jewish Social Studies, Journal for the Feminist Study of Religion, andYIVO Annual. Additionally, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. For over two decades she edited The Modern Jewish Experience from the Indiana University Press. She was the recipient of various honors and awards: a 1999 National Jewish Book Award, a 2004 Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, and honorary degrees from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 2000, the Hebrew Union College in 2002, and the Hebrew College in 2010. Hyman died on December 15, 2011 from a long fight with breast cancer, which she was very open about. She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley Rosenbaum, her two daughters, Judith and Adina, two grandchildren, Ma‚Äôayan and Aviv, her mother Ida, and her two sisters, Merle and Toby. After her death, Hyman was commemorated by the commencement of the Paula Hyman Oral History Project, created in part by the Women‚Äôs Caucus of the Association of Jewish Studies (AJS). Hyman was part of this caucus until the time of her death. The goal of this oral history was to conserve the reflections of the founding members of the caucus. Additionally, Hyman was commemorated by the creation of the Paula E. Hyman Mentoring Program, which selects every year young women scholars of Jewish women's and genders studies and pairs them with older mentors in the same field.  Activism  In 1971 Hyman helped found Ezrat Nashim, a Jewish activist group whose goal was the ordination of women as Conservative rabbis and cantors, a foreshadowing of her later position as a champion of gender equality in religious Jewish life. While at Columbia, Hyman and other Jewish feminists wrote a manifesto to call for the ordination of women rabbis and cantors in Conservative Judaism, which they then delivered to hundreds of conservative rabbis at a Rabbinical Assembly. The title of this manifesto was ‚ÄúJewish Women Call for Change.‚Äù In both her personal and professional life, Hyman championed feminist ideology and sought to end political and historical sexism. Additionally, when she became the first woman to join organizations in the United States, Israel, and Europe, she would be certain to attain the participation of other women, helping further her activist identity.  Research Interests and Reception  Hyman's research interests included topics in modern European and American Jewish history, with a special emphasis on the history of women and gender. Her work can be summed up as the interaction of Judaism and feminism in various countries. Some of her particular interests are the way in which French Jewry changed from the Dreyfus Affair to the present, and how Eastern European Jewish women immigrants interacted with work outside the home. On the latter topic, Hyman is known for her works on Jewish women in New York as activists in events such as the kosher meat boycott in 1902 and the New York rent strike of 1907. Her interest in such activism finds its base in her growing up in the 1960s, an era known for its social changes including a widely-fought feminist movement. Paula Hyman was recognized as one of the founders of Jewish women's studies and was seen as a role model for her colleagues and students for her dedication to this field. This field finds one of its starts in Hyman's The Jewish Woman in America. In addition, she was seen as a changing force in how the modern Jewish experience is understood by scholars and laymen alike. This shift included a newfound focus on the daily ins and outs of American and European Jewish life as well as exposing the lives of often overlooked populations, such as women, through a use of popular and archival sources. After Hyman's death, Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies and Gender Issues dedicated issue twenty-two of their journal to Hyman.

It was one of the largest trusts of the early 20th century and one of the largest mining companies in the world for much of the 20th century.Encyclopaedia Britannica Founded in 1881 when Marcus Daly bought a silver mine, the company expanded rapidly based on the discovery of huge copper deposits. Daly built a smelter in Anaconda to process copper mined in Butte. Daly sold his assets in 1899 to H H Rogers and William Rockefeller. By 1910, Amalgamated had expanded its operations and bought the assets of two other Montana copper companies. In 1922, Anaconda bought mining operations in Mexico and Chile; the latter was the largest mine in the world and yielded two-thirds of the company's profits. The company added aluminum reduction to its portfolio in 1955. In the 1950s, the company switched over from underground to open-pit mining. In 1960 its operations still had 37,000 employees in North America and Chile. It was purchased by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) on January 12, 1977. Anaconda halted production in 1980, and mining ceased completely in 1982 when the deep pumps keeping the mine drained were shut off, allowing the Berkeley Pit to fill. What remains is a massive Superfund site, with CERCLA liability for British Petroleum, who bought out ARCO. History of Anaconda Copper =Beginnings= Anaconda Copper Mining Company was started in 1881 when Marcus Daly bought a small silver mine called Anaconda near Butte, Montana. At the time, Daly was working for the Walker Bros. (mining investors) of Salt Lake City, Utah, as a mine manager and engineer of the Alice, a silver mine in Walkerville, a suburb of Butte. While working in the Alice, he noticed significant quantities of high grade copper ore. Daly obtained permission from the owner of the Anaconda and several other mines in the area, to inspect the workings. He was a geologist and knew the red mineral he was looking at. Daly recommended the mine to the Walker Bros., who sent another geologist to inspect the Anaconda. Daly's employers were not interested in the mine, and he sold his interest in the Alice to purchase it himself. Placer gold and silver lode mining had taken place at Butte, placer mining at Helena, Bannock and Virginia City, Montana territory respectively, and Butte was nearing the end of its silver lode mining phase. Lacking capital to develop the mine, Daly asked George Hearst, San Francisco mining magnate, for additional support. Daly had recommended Hearst purchase the Ontario mine, a silver mine in Alta, Utah, which consequently made Hearst many millions. Hearst brought in additional partners, James Ben Ali Haggin and Lloyd Tevis, and the Anaconda Company was born. While mining the silver left in his mine, huge deposits of copper were soon developed and Daly became a copper magnate. When surrounding silver mines \\"played out\\" and closed, Daly quietly bought up the neighboring mines, forming a mining company. Daly built a smelter at Anaconda, Montana, building a company town to support the workers, and connected his smelter to Butte by his Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway.Laurie Mercier, Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City (University of Illinois Press, 2001) Butte became one of the most prosperous cities in the country, often called \\"the Richest Hill on Earth.\\" From 1892 through 1903, the Anaconda mine itself was the largest copper-producing mine in the world.Horace. J. Stevens (1908) The Copper Handbook, v.8, Houghton, Mich.: Horace J. Stevens, p.1457. It produced more than $300 billion worth of metal in its lifetime. =Rothschilds= In 1889 the Rothschilds tried to gain control of the world copper market. In 1892 the French Rothschilds began negotiations to buy the Anaconda mine. In mid-October 1895 the Rothschilds, French and British, bought one quarter of the stock in Anaconda for $7.5 million. By the late 1890s the Rothschilds probably had control over the sale of about forty percent of the world's copper production.George H. LaBarre Galleries Anaconda Inv# MS1000 Stock =Rockefellers= The Rothschilds' role in Anaconda was brief. In 1899, Daly teamed up with two directors of Standard Oil to create the giant Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, one of the largest trusts of the early 20th century. The leading roles in the takeover were played by Henry Huttleston Rogers (John D. Rockefeller's friend and a key man in his Standard Oil businesses) and William Rockefeller (John's brother). They were aided by company promoter Thomas W. Lawson. Although Rogers and William Rockefeller were Standard Oil directors, the company of Standard Oil did not have a stake in this business, nor did its founder and head, John D. Rockefeller, who disliked such stock promotions.Ron Chernow, Titan (New York: Random House, 1998), p. 380. By 1899 Amalgamated Copper acquired majority stock in the Anaconda Copper Company, and the Rothschilds appear to have had no further role in the company. By his death in 1900, Marcus Daly had just become president of the holding company valued at $75 million. Lawson later had a falling out with Rogers and Rockefeller, and wrote of the experience in a book Frenzied Finance (1905). Colored by Lawson's bitterness, the book offered insight into aspects of high finance. Amalgamated competes in copper At the beginning of the 1900s, due to electrification (and Amalgamated's maintenance of an artificially high copper price), copper was very profitable, and copper mining expanded rapidly. Between 1899 and 1915, Anaconda, controlled by Standard Oil insiders, stayed under the name of Amalgamated Copper Company. Amalgamated was in conflict with powerful copper king F. Augustus Heinze, who also owned mines in Butte; in 1902 he consolidated these as the United Copper Company. Neither organization was able to monopolize copper extraction in Montana. In addition, although Butte was the most prolific copper-mining district in the world, Amalgamated could not control production from other copper producing districts, such as those in Michigan, Utah, Arizona, or countries outside the United States. Marcus Daly passed away in 1900. His widow began a close friendship with a shrewd, intelligent businessman, John D. Ryan, who assumed the presidency of Daly's bank and management of his widow's fortune. The leaders of Amalgamated turned to Ryan, famous for his negotiation skills, for help in creating a monopoly at Butte. Control of the areas producing mines was a key to high income. Ryan convinced Heinze to walk away with abundant compensation, allowing Amalgamated to take over Heinze's properties as well as the properties of William A. Clark (another Butte copper magnate). Amalgamated gained almost complete control of Butte's copper as they merged with these companies. The reorganized company was again named Anaconda. Ryan made its president and rewarded with a significant package of Amalgamated shares. The \\"right hand\\" of John Ryan was Cornelius Kelley, a young attorney, who soon was given the position of vice- president. Henry Rogers died suddenly in 1909 of a stroke, but William Rockefeller brought in his son Percy Rockefeller to help with leadership. In 1912 and 13, the Pujo Committee investigated William Rockefeller and others for allegedly earning $30 million in profit through cornering of the copper market and \\"synchronizing with artificially enforced activity\\" in Amalgamated Copper stock in the New York Stock Exchange.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/01/06/100603509.pdf =The golden twenties= During the 1920s, metal prices went up and mining activity increased. Those were really the golden years for Anaconda. The company was managed by the Ryan-Kelley team and was growing fast, expanding into the exploitation of new base metal resources: manganese and zinc. In 1922 the company acquired mining operations in Chile and Mexico (Cananea). The mining operation in Chile (Chuquicamata), was acquired from the Guggenheims in 1923. It cost Anaconda $77 million and was the largest copper mine in the world. It produced copper yielding two-thirds to three-fourths of the Anaconda Company's profits. The same year ACM purchased American Brass Company, the nation's largest brass fabricator and a major consumer of copper and zinc. In 1926 Anaconda acquired the Giesche company, a large mining and industrial firm, operating in the Upper Silesia region of Poland. This nation had gained independence after World War I. At that time Anaconda was the fourth-largest company in the world. These heady times, however, were short-lived. =Great speculation= In 1928, Ryan and Rockefeller aggressively speculated on Anaconda shares by manipulating the supply of copper (reducing supply to corner the market), causing shares to go up at first; at which point they sold, which caused stocks to fall; then buying them back. Known today as a \\"pump and dump\\", at the time the actions were not illegal and took place frequently. Anaconda was producing copper at such a rate they had tremendous stockpiles. To control prices, the company only sold the requested supply. Under the pressure of a \\"joint account\\" set up by Ryan and Rockefeller of nearly a million and a half shares of Anaconda Copper Company, prices fluctuated from $40 in December 1928, to $128 in March 1929. Selling large volumes of shares rather quickly causes the bottom to fall out of the market; investors lose confidence and dump their shares, causing a domino effect. Small investors would purchase blocks of shares on credit, and when they could not sell at or above the given price, had to sell the shares at a loss when the banks called on their loans for the purchase of said shares. Smaller investors were completely wiped out. The results are still considered one of the greatest fleecings in Wall Street history. The United States Senate held hearings on the stock manipulations, concluding that those operations cost the public at the very least, $150 million. A 1933 Senate banking committee called these operations the greatest frauds in American banking history, a leading cause of the 1929 stock market crash and 1930s depression. =Great Depression= In 1929 Anaconda Copper Mining Co. issued new stock and used some of the money to buy shares of speculative companies. When the market crashed on Oct. 29, 1929, Anaconda suffered serious financial setbacks. At the same time, copper prices started dropping dramatically. During the winter of 1932‚Äì33, as the Depression expanded, copper prices dropped to 10.3 cents per pound, down from an average of 29.5 cents per pound only two years earlier. The Great Depression took a toll in the mining industry; decline in demand led to the company making massive layoffs in both the United States and Chile (up to 66 percent unemployment rate in the Chilean mines). On March 26, 1931, Anaconda cut its dividend rate 40%. John D. Ryan died in 1933 and was buried in a copper coffin. His mighty Anaconda shares, once worth $175 each, had dropped to $4 at the low of the Great Depression. Cornelius Kelley became the Chairman in 1940. =Beginning of WWII= The victory labor-management production committee of the Butte mines, September 1942. In the back row from left to right are: J.A.

Butte mining, like most U.S. industry, remained depressed until the dawn of World War II, when the demand for war materials greatly increased the need for copper, zinc, and manganese. Anaconda ranked 58th among United States corporations in the value of World War II-military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School, p. 619 That relieved some of the economic tensions. The end of World War II brought another depression in the copper industry because of a decline in demand after war production ended. =1950s= During the post-war years, demand and prices for copper dropped. At the same time mining costs had risen precipitously. As a result, copper production from Butte's underground vein mines dropped to only 45,000 mt annually. Anaconda tasked its engineers with devising new techniques to keep mining profitable. The answer was called the \\"Greater Butte Project\\" (GBP). The project would exploit lower-grade underground reserves by the block-caving method. Anaconda sank a new shaft, the Kelly, and the mine began producing in 1948. The new method was successful, although short-lived. They also began stripping ground for what was to become the Berkeley pit. In 1956 Anaconda netted the largest annual income in its history: $111.5 million. After that year, ore grades continued their decline, mining costs were rising each year, and profits were diminishing. To survive, the company switched to open-pit mining, a very area- consuming method. The Berkeley Pit kept expanding and ate away at the older parts of Butte. =1970s= In 1971, Chile's newly elected Socialist president Salvador Allende confiscated the Chuquicamata mine from Anaconda, stripping Anaconda of two-thirds of its copper production. Allende was overthrown in 1973, and the successor government of Augusto Pinochet paid Anaconda compensation of $250 million. Losses from the Chilean takeover however, had seriously weakened the company's financial position. Later in 1971, Anaconda's Mexican copper mine Compa√±√≠a Minera de Cananea, S.A. was nationalized by president Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez's government. An unwise investment in the unsuccessful Twin Buttes mine in southern Arizona further weakened the company. In 1977 Anaconda was sold to Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) for $700 million. However, the purchase turned out to be a regrettable decision for ARCO. Lack of experience with hard-rock mining, and a sudden drop in the price of copper to sixty-odd cents a pound, the lowest in years, caused ARCO to suspend all underground mining operations in Butte in 1980. ARCO closed the Berkeley Pit and shut off the deep pumps in 1982, allowing the pit and mines to fill with water. The Continental Pit, the last active Anaconda mining property in Butte, was closed in 1982. Six years after ARCO acquired rights to the \\"Richest Hill on Earth\\", Butte's mines were completely idle. ARCO founder, Robert Orville Anderson, stated \\"he hoped Anaconda's resources and expertise would help him launch a major shale-oil venture, but that the world oil glut and the declining price of petroleum made shale oil moot.\\" At the time of the sale to ARCO, Anaconda had large working hard coal holdings in the Black Thunder mine at Thunder Basin, Wyoming. ARCO planned to diversify its energy business into coal. In June 1998, Arch Coal completed the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. =Superfund site= Closing down the mines was not the end of the new owner's problems. The areas of Butte, Anaconda, and the Clark Fork River in this vicinity became highly contaminated by mining and smelting operations. Milling and smelting produced wastes with high concentrations of arsenic, as well as copper, cadmium, lead, zinc, and other heavy metals. Beginning in 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Upper Clark Fork river basin and many associated areas as Superfund sites‚Äîthe nation's largest. The EPA named ARCO as the \\"potentially responsible party.\\" As a result, ARCO was obliged to remediate (clean up) the area. Since then, ARCO has spent hundreds of millions of dollars decontaminating and rehabilitating the area, though the job is far from finished. ARCO merged with BP in 2000. BP in turn sold most of ARCO to Tesoro in 2010. Aluminum operations in Columbia Falls Anaconda diversified into aluminum production in 1952, when they purchased rights to build an aluminum reduction plant in Columbia Falls. After two years of construction, the plant went online in August 1955. Following two expansions in the 1960s, the plant had a peak output capacity of 180,000 tons annually. ARCO kept the plant open after Butte copper operations ceased in 1982, and sold the plant to a group of investors led by a former ARCO executive in 1985, due to high electricity costs and low market prices. As Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC), the plant continued operations as an independent company until it was purchased by Swiss metals giant Glencore AG in 1999. Glencore continued CFAC operations through 2009, when it temporarily shuttered the plant due to high electricity costs and low market prices. On March 3, 2015, the closure became permanent. Anaconda Copper in literature and film * The independent documentary An Injury to One (2002) by Travis Wilkerson chronicles the history of Anaconda in Butte, Montana, and its efforts to suppress unionization by its workers. Organizer Frank Little of the IWW was lynched and no one was ever prosecuted for his murder. The short film ends with a discussion of Berkeley Pit. * Michael Punke's Fire and Brimstone: The North Butte Mining Disaster of 1917 covers the Speculator Mine disaster of 1917 in Butte, and the impact that had on big mining and unions in Montana. * The 2008 PBS documentary Butte, America covers similar themes. * In the film The Motorcycle Diaries (2004), Che Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado watch as desperately poor men are being hired for very dangerous work in Anaconda's Chuquicamata mine in Chile. * The novel Sweet Thunder (2013) by Ivan Doig recounts a journalistic duel between a union newspaper and a company newspaper in 1920s Butte.

By 1920, the Anaconda Company owned several of the states newspapers including the Butte Post, Butte Miner, Anaconda Standard, Daily Missoulian, Helena Independent, and Billings Gazette.1 Work, Clemens P. Darkest before Dawn: Sedition and Free speech in the American West. (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2005), 85. The Anaconda Company controlled the economic and political dealings throughout Montana well into the mid-1900s.Richard W. Behan, Plundered Promise: Capitalism, Politics, and the Fate of the Federal Lands. (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2001), 28.alt=\\"Semiotic Square of the Anaconda Copper Company and the \\"copper collar\\".\\" As the state's largest employer, Anaconda dominated Montana politics. In the political arena the \\"copper collar\\" symbolized influence, wealth, and power. In 1894, Montana held an election to decide which city would be its capital. Marcus Daly, an Anaconda supporter, used his power over the papers to further his cause.3 Holmes, Krys, Susan C. Dailey, and David Walter. Montana: Stories of the Land. (Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society Press, 2008), 39. While campaigning, \\"Anaconda's supporters portrayed Helena as a center of avarice and elitism while promoting their choice as the pick of the working man. In return, Helena's backers claimed that if the victory should go to their opponent the entire state would be strangled by the \\"copper collar\\" of Daly's Anaconda Copper Mining Company.\\"Kirby Lambert, Patricia Mullan Burnham, and Susan R. Near. Montana's State Capitol: The People's House. (Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society Press, 2002), 1 Daly's campaign was unsuccessful and Helena became the state's capital. Flexing its political muscle again in 1903, the Anaconda Company closed down operations within all of Montana, putting 15,000 men out of work until the legislature enacted the regulations it demanded. Montanans were angered by this decision and from that point forward, to suggest a politician \\"wore a copper collar\\", could cost him the election.Norma Smith, Jeannette Rankin, America's Conscience. (Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society Press, 2002), 79. The copper collar symbolized oppression and control to the people of Butte.

(Urbana: University of > Illinois Press, 1997), 225. Choosing sides in this battle was unavoidable. According to Author Fisher's article, \\"Montana: Land of the Copper Collar,\\" \\"Six months is the longest one may live in Montana without making the decision whether one is 'for the Company' or 'against the Company.' The all-pervading and unrelenting nature of the struggle admits of no neutrals. Since the territory's admission to statehood in 1889 the struggle has continued.\\"Fisher, Author. \\"Montana: Land of the Copper Collar.\\" The Nation (September 5, 1923): 117. The term \\"copper collar\\" was used in historical novels set in that period. In The Old Copper Collar (1957), a tale of the course of a senatorial election in Helena in the early 20th century, Dan Cushman refers to the \\"copper collar\\": \\"At this point the galleries packed with Bennett sympathizers commenced heckling him with suggestions he wore the Copper Collar, but these hoots and catcalls he contemptuously ignored, reiterated his freedom from all cliques, factions, and corporations and that his purpose had been purely and simply to prove or disprove unlawful practices, and sat down.\\" Even the suggestion that a person wore the \\"copper collar\\" created pandemonium from the crowd.CUSHMAN, DAN. THE OLD COPPER COLLAR. Baltimore, MD: Ballantine Books, 1957. Ivan Doig refers to the \\"copper collar\\" in his novel Work Song (2010). In 1919, Gracie resists the powerful Anaconda Company as they try to force her to sell her property. She says, \\"Leave this house at once, Whoever-You-Are Morgan. I'll not have under my roof a man who wears the copper collar.\\" The workers who are under the \\"copper collar\\" are referred to as \\"snakes\\" and the Anaconda Company is referred to as an \\"ogre\\".Ivan Doig, Work Song. Riverhead, MT: Riverhead, 2010. The \\"copper collar\\" symbolized different things to different people but \\"the Anaconda Company used the tactics of an authoritarian state to quash a legitimate labor movement within its corporate fiefdom. That the press, an elemental part of democracy, was used in the assault marks a black period in the history of American journalism.\\"7 Work, Clemens P., 86. In Homelands: A Geography of Culture and Place across America, John B. Wright writes that for decades, the Anaconda Company: > mined and smelted metal, leveled forests, owned the newspapers, bribed the > legislature, set the wages, murdered union organizers, exported the > earnings, and finally shut down, leaving Butte and Anaconda the poorest > cities in the states and the largest EPA Superfund site in the > country.Richard L. Nostrand and Lawrence E. Estaville (eds.), Homelands: A > Geography of Culture and Place across America. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins > University Press, 2001), 227. The phrase \\"copper collar\\" is also an example of metonymy when it is substituted for the act of the Anaconda Company controlling a person. It is closely related to the company because it is made of copper, which is what the company mined. A collar is a device used to control, which is what the company used the copper collar for. In the Semiotic Square for the \\"copper collar\\" (see illustration), Marcus Daly is considered the assertion and Miners is the negation in the first binary pair. The second binary relationship is created on the \\"control\\" axis. Union, the not Marcus Daly element, is considered to be the complex term, and \\"copper collar\\", the Miner element, is the neutral term. Both a union and the \\"copper collar\\" are things that are used to gain control. The Anaconda Company used the copper collar to gain control of the papers and legislature, and the miners wanted to establish a union to gain some control over their working conditions.

History The area was subject to flooding by the River Torrens, which originally ran into an area named \\"The Reedbeds\\" in the upper reaches of the Port River. In the 1930s the Torrens Channel, also named Breakout Creek, was cut through the coastal dunes to Gulf St Vincent, to drain the wetlands and eliminate the flooding. A large part of Lockleys is within a bend of the River Torrens. Hence, prior to subdivision, the area was renowned for its rich soil, market gardens and greenhouses. The name comes from a property (section 145) owned by Charles Brown Fisher, then Edward Meade Bagot and Gabriel Bennett, who built a course there for amateur horse racing. The property was rented by trainers J. Eden Savill and C. Leslie Macdonald for their Lockleys Stables where many good racehorses were prepared. The area was subdivided for housing. The Hank family had substantial holdings; the Hank brothers were footballers for West Torrens Football Club, with Bob Hank winning the Magarey Medal in both 1946 and 1947. The suburb is the home of the \\"EDS request management\\" and \\"EDS credit services\\" in the former John Martins bulk store on Pierson Street. Prior to EDS's conversion of the warehouse, this was used as a storage location for the floats used in the John Martin's Christmas Pageant. Activities and sport Lockleys is home to the Lockleys Football Club, known as the Demons, who play in the South Australian Amateur Football League. The Kooyonga Golf Course is located in Lockleys and has hosted the South Australian Open Golf Championships. Kooyonga was the name of the suburb before it became Lockleys. Lockleys was the home of the former Odeon Star cinema, later re-named to Windsor Lockleys Cinema, on Henley Beach Road which ceased operating in August 2012 and demolished in 2020. Government Lockleys is in the City of West Torrens local government area, split between the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Colton and electoral district of West Torrens, and in the Australian House of Representatives Division of Hindmarsh.  Education  The suburb has a state primary school Lockleys North Primary School and a parochial primary school St Francis School. Despite its name, Lockleys Primary School is located in nearby suburb Brooklyn Park. = Lockleys North Primary School = Lockleys North Primary School is a coeducational grades R-7 school (5‚Äì13 year olds) located on Malurus Avenue. Students come from a wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds due to the demographics of West Torrens area.  History  With the expansion of the western suburbs of Adelaide the school was built in 1960. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary with an open day for old scholars and old staff on 14 November 2010. Lockleys North Primary was one of 20 schools around Australia, (only 2 from South Australia, the other being Charles Campbell Secondary School), invited to participate in the Microsoft Innovative Schools Forum in 2011.  Facilities  The school houses the Lockleys North Gymnasium and up to date access to technology. There are sports fields on the grounds of the school and a range of outdoor learning areas. Lockleys North Primary School received $3,200,000 under the National School Pride (NSP) program and Primary Schools for the 21st Century (P21) element of the Building the Education Revolution (BER). In August 2010 Lockleys North Primary School built two new buildings ‚Äì \\"Tirkandi\\" (Library) and \\"Torrens\\" (classrooms for year 6-7's). The library was opened by Steve Georganas, MHR for the seat of Hindmarsh. The school grounds also has a soccer pitch which not only used by the school but also other clubs.

The Chrysostom Monastery () was a monastery in Moscow. It was consecrated to Saint John Chrysostom (Russian: Ivan Zlatoust).  History  The cloister to the east from the Kitai-gorod was first mentioned in 1412 when a Novgorod archdeacon was buried there. In 1478, Grand Prince Ivan III, who had a suburban palace nearby, had the wooden cathedral rebuilt in stone. When a Crimean Khan Devlet I Giray attacked Moscow in 1571, the monastery was burnt down. It was later restored, only to be damaged again in 1611 during the Time of Troubles. In 1660, Ivan III's stone cathedral burnt down and was replaced by a new five-domed cathedral, which survived into the 20th century. In 1706, the monastery hegumen was raised to the rank of archmandrite. In 1737, the Chrysostom Monastery was gutted by fire, but it would be restored in 1738-1740. The monastery subsisted owing to the donations from the noblemen who had their estates nearby, notably the Counts Apraksin and Rumyantsev. Some members of these families, particularly those who served in the Navy, were buried there: Matvei Apraksin, Fyodor Apraksin, Alexander Rumyantsev, Ivan Akimovich Senyavin. In 1742, Empress Elizabeth visited the Chrysostom Monastery and donated 2,000 rubles for the construction of the Church of Saint Elizabeth. In 1764, the monastery was granted an annual allowance of 806 rubles and 30 kopecks, which would be increased to 1460 rubles during the reign of Paul I. During the Patriotic War of 1812, the sacristy of the monastery was moved to Vologda. The monastery itself was damaged by the French and then restored in 1816. By 1907, there had been an archmandrite, 11 monks and 2 novices in the monastery. In the early 20th century, a parish school was opened on the grounds. In 1933, the buildings of the Chrysostom Monastery were dismantled by the Soviets under pretext of their dilapidation. On its place, a constructivist edifice was erected. The graves of the Russian naval leaders were desecrated. The monastic cells of the Chrysostom Monastery, built in 1862, can still be seen in Maly Zlatoustinsky Lane in Moscow.

The most notable application of this method is in computational fluid dynamics. The concept of TVD was introduced by Ami Harten. Model equation In systems described by partial differential equations, such as the following hyperbolic advection equation, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0, the total variation (TV) is given by :TV(u(\\\\cdot,t)) = \\\\int \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right \\\\mathrm{d}x , and the total variation for the discrete case is, :TV(u^n) = TV(u(\\\\cdot,t^n)) = \\\\sum_j \\\\left u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n \\\\right . where u_{j}^n=u(x_{j},t^n). A numerical method is said to be total variation diminishing (TVD) if, :TV \\\\left( u^{n+1}\\\\right) \\\\leq TV \\\\left( u^{n}\\\\right) . Characteristics A numerical scheme is said to be monotonicity preserving if the following properties are maintained: *If u^{n} is monotonically increasing (or decreasing) in space, then so is u^{n+1}. proved the following properties for a numerical scheme, *A monotone scheme is TVD, and *A TVD scheme is monotonicity preserving. Application in CFD In Computational Fluid Dynamics, TVD scheme is employed to capture sharper shock predictions without any misleading oscillations when variation of field variable ‚Äú\\\\phi ‚Äù is discontinuous. To capture the variation fine grids (\\\\Delta x very small) are needed and the computation becomes heavy and therefore uneconomic. The use of coarse grids with central difference scheme, upwind scheme, hybrid difference scheme, and power law scheme gives false shock predictions. TVD scheme enables sharper shock predictions on coarse grids saving computation time and as the scheme preserves monotonicity there are no spurious oscillations in the solution. Discretisation Consider the steady state one-dimensional convection diffusion equation, : abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\phi)\\\\,= abla \\\\cdot (\\\\Gamma abla \\\\phi)+S_{\\\\phi}\\\\; , where \\\\rho is the density, \\\\mathbf{u} is the velocity vector, \\\\phi is the property being transported, \\\\Gamma is the coefficient of diffusion and S_{\\\\phi} is the source term responsible for generation of the property \\\\phi . Making the flux balance of this property about a control volume we get, :\\\\int_A \\\\mathbf {n} \\\\cdot (\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\phi) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}A = \\\\int_A \\\\mathbf{n} \\\\cdot (\\\\Gamma abla \\\\phi) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}A+ \\\\int_CV S_\\\\phi \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}V \\\\; Here \\\\mathbf {n} is the normal to the surface of control volume. Ignoring the source term, the equation further reduces to: :(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u} \\\\phi A)_r - (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u} \\\\phi A)_l = \\\\left(\\\\Gamma A \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_r-\\\\left(\\\\Gamma A \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_l A picture showing the control volume with velocities at the faces,nodes and the distance between them, where 'P' is the node at the center. Assuming : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x}= \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\phi}{\\\\delta x} and A_r = A_l, The equation reduces to :(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u} \\\\phi)_r - (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u} \\\\phi)_l \\\\,= \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{\\\\delta x} \\\\delta \\\\phi\\\\right)_r - \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{\\\\delta x} \\\\delta \\\\phi\\\\right)_l. Say, : F_r=(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{u})_r ;\\\\qquad F_l=(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{u})_l; : D_l = \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\Gamma}{\\\\delta x}\\\\right)_l ;\\\\qquad D_r =\\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\Gamma}{\\\\delta x}\\\\right)_r; From the figure: : \\\\delta \\\\phi _r = \\\\phi_R -\\\\phi_P ;\\\\qquad\\\\delta x_r = x_{PR}; : \\\\delta \\\\phi _l = \\\\phi_P -\\\\phi_L ;\\\\qquad\\\\delta x_l = x_{LP}; The equation becomes,F_r \\\\phi_r - F_l \\\\phi_l = D_r (\\\\phi _R -\\\\phi _P)-D_l(\\\\phi _P - \\\\phi _L);Also the continuity equation has to be satisfied in one of its equivalent forms for this problem: :(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u})_r -(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf {u})_l\\\\,=0\\\\ \\\\ \\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\ \\\\ F_r-F_l=0\\\\ \\\\ \\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\ F_r=F_l=F. Assuming diffusivity is a homogeneous property and equal grid spacing we can say : \\\\Gamma _l=\\\\Gamma _r; \\\\qquad \\\\delta x_{LP}=\\\\delta x_{PR} = \\\\delta x, we get D_l=D_r=D.The equation further reduces to(\\\\phi_r-\\\\phi_l)\\\\cdot F=D\\\\cdot(\\\\phi_R-2\\\\phi_P+\\\\phi_L).The equation above can be written as(\\\\phi_r-\\\\phi_l)\\\\cdot P=(\\\\phi_R-2\\\\phi_P+\\\\phi_L) where P is the P√©clet number :P=\\\\frac{F}{D}=\\\\frac{\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\delta x}{\\\\Gamma}. TVD scheme Total variation diminishing scheme makes an assumption for the values of \\\\phi_r and \\\\phi_l to be substituted in the discretized equation as follows: :\\\\phi_r\\\\cdot P=\\\\frac{1}{2}(P+P)[f_r^+\\\\phi_R+(1-f_r^+)\\\\phi_L]+\\\\frac{1}{2}(P-P)[f_r^-\\\\phi_P+(1-f_r^-)\\\\phi_{RR}] :\\\\phi_l\\\\cdot P=\\\\frac{1}{2}(P+P)[f_l^+\\\\phi_P+(1-f_l^+)\\\\phi_{LL}]+\\\\frac{1}{2}(P-P)[f_l^-\\\\phi_L+(1-f_l^-)\\\\phi_R] Where P is the P√©clet number and f is the weighing function to be determined from, :f=f\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\phi_U-\\\\phi_{UU}}{\\\\phi_D-\\\\phi_{UU}}\\\\right) where U refers to upstream, UU refers to upstream of U and D refers to downstream. Note that f^+ is the weighing function when the flow is in positive direction (i.e., from left to right) and f^- is the weighing function when the flow is in the negative direction from right to left. So, : \\\\begin{align} & f_r^+\\\\text{ is a function of }\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_P-\\\\phi_L}{\\\\phi_R-\\\\phi_L}\\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & f_r^-\\\\text{ is a function of }\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_R-\\\\phi_{RR}}{\\\\phi_P-\\\\phi_{RR}}\\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & f_l^+\\\\text{ is a function of }\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_L-\\\\phi_{LL}}{\\\\phi_P-\\\\phi_{LL}}\\\\right),\\\\text{ and} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & f_l^-\\\\text{ is a function of }\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\phi_P-\\\\phi_R}{\\\\phi_L-\\\\phi_R}\\\\right). \\\\end{align} If the flow is in positive direction then, P√©clet number P is positive and the term (P-P)= 0, so the function f^- won‚Äôt play any role in the assumption of \\\\phi_r and \\\\phi_l. Likewise when the flow is in negative direction, P is negative and the term (P+P)= 0, so the function f^+ won‚Äôt play any role in the assumption of \\\\phi_r and \\\\phi_r. It therefore takes into account the values of property depending on the direction of flow and using the weighted functions tries to achieve monotonicity in the solution thereby producing results with no spurious shocks. Limitations Monotone schemes are attractive for solving engineering and scientific problems because they do not produce non-physical solutions. Godunov's theorem proves that linear schemes which preserve monotonicity are, at most, only first order accurate. Higher order linear schemes, although more accurate for smooth solutions, are not TVD and tend to introduce spurious oscillations (wiggles) where discontinuities or shocks arise.

His novel Poo Lorn of the Elephants was filmed by Alejandro Jodorowsky in 1980 under the name Tusk.IMDB profile of Reginald Campbell Another novel, Tiger Valley, was filmed in 1936 by Howard Bretherton as The Girl from Mandalay. He described his personal experiences from Thailand in the book Teak-Wallah: The Adventures of a Young Englishman in Thailand in the 1920s. In his book Teak Wallah, he describes a character called Smith who was his assistant in Muang Ngow - Flight Lieutenant 'Dick' Frederick Murison who almost died from fever in the teak jungle and later served as a bomber pilot in Afghanistan in the late 20s.Fred Murison: a Teak Wallah's legacy http://wna.org.au/fred.html Orwell may be Mr W. Elder, Forest Manager of Anglo-Siam Forest Company, a heroic figure who lived amongst the elephants of Muang Ngow near Lakon (in the book Nakon) and retired in Riverhead, Kent dying in about 1935. He gives a fairly accurate appraisal of life as an assistant forest manager with its dangers from disease and wild animals while logging teak with elephants. Campbell also wrote a book about an elephant breeder and trader in Siam in the 1920s, which is a ripping yarn but scarcely believable called \\"Jungle Nights\\". The rapturous conclusion is a full on Roman style elephant charge in phalanx formation against the evil Mongol elephant trader who is stampeding a wild herd into his compound that is unintentionally hilarious. Tubby Kenson's character, (a bumbling teak wallah who the hero, Jim Dales (Reggie), takes the gal, Pat Bell from), may be based partly on Fred Murison to whom Reggie handed his signed book to in Dec 1934. Fred was not impressed. The book should be turned into a comedy movie of the period it is so poorly written. He writes in a simple stilted 1920s fashion of heroes and villains, also damsels in distress. He could not be classified as a great writer by any stretch of the imagination. This book is out of print and rare.https://www.amazon.com/Jungle- night-novel-Reginald-Campbell/dp/B0006AMAR0 He wrote \\"Cruiser In Action\\" about his Naval experiences.

He is best known for his acoustic jazz guitar playing, strongly influenced by Django Reinhardt, for his contributions to the UK trad jazz, skiffle and folk scenes as a performer and humorist, and for his collaborations with the violinist St√©phane Grappelli. Biography =Early life= William Charles Disley was born, to Welsh parents then overseas for work, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. When he was four, his parents moved back to Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire in Wales and then five years later to Ingleton, North Yorkshire, England, where his mother worked as schoolteacher. In his childhood, he learned to play the banjo but took up jazz guitar at the age of 15 after being exposed to the playing of Django Reinhardt via a neighbour, Norry Greenwood. As Disley recalled, Greenwood taught him the chords to \\"Miss Annabel Lee\\" and \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" in the summer of 1946.D. Disley, in sleeve notes for Norry Greenwood & The Craven Hot Club's Sweet and Swinging CD (G8INA-CD003, 1999) Disley showed an early gift for drawing. On leaving school he enrolled at Leeds College of Art, a college with a reputation for student music making, in particular trad jazz, and was soon playing in the Vernon City Ramblers and the Yorkshire Jazz Band with trumpeter Dick Hawdon and clarinettist Alan Cooper. Disley did his National Service overseas in the Army from 1950‚Äì1953 after which he resumed his studies in Leeds and began selling cartoons to national newspapers and periodicals. In 1953 he worked for a summer season in Morecambe, Lancashire, as part of the comedy harmony group The Godfrey Brothers, still playing banjo. He moved to London and joined Mick Mulligan's band with George Melly.The Times obituary, 3 April 2010, accessed 7 April 2010 Melly described him as having \\"a beard and [...] the face of a satyr en route to a cheerful orgy\\". He worked with most of the trad jazz bands of the day, including those of Ken Colyer, Cy Laurie, Sandy Brown, Kenny Ball, and Alex Welsh. He played banjo and occasionally guitar. His first love remained the music of Django Reinhardt, in particular the sound of the pre-war Quintette du Hot Club de France. In 1958 he formed a quintet to replicate that sound, employing Dick Powell on violin, Danny Pursford and Nevil Skrimshire on rhythm guitars, and a range of double bassists including Tim Mahn. As skiffle dominated traditional jazz in popular culture in the UK, in the late 1950s- early 60s Disley started working as guitarist with a number of skiffle groups, including those of Ken Colyer, Lonnie Donegan, Bob Cort and Nancy Whiskey, and performed on numerous recordings. With Ike Isaacs he appeared on Ken Sykora's Guitar Club on BBC Radio for a number of years and was voted second best (1960) and best (1961) British jazz guitarist in the UK Melody Maker jazz polls. In January 1963, the British music magazine, NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace. The event included George Melly, Alex Welsh, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan, and Disley. That same year Diz played the conductor in the Harrison Marks film The Chimney Sweeps (1963), a slapstick comedy starring Pamela Green. =Folk club performer and humorist= In the early to mid 60s, the \\"trad\\" and skiffle booms were coming to an end and Disley moved across to the emerging folk club scene, developing a new persona as an entertainer/musical comedian with an act based on songs from trad jazz and the British music hall and other humorous ditties accompanied by lightly swinging guitar, monologues in the manner of Stanley Holloway (especially those penned by Marriott Edgar), banter with the audience, and a string of one-line jokes in the manner of W. C. Fields and Groucho Marx, always finding room at the end of the evening for some hot-club- style guitar instrumentals, often with the assistance of some unsuspecting second guitarist invited up from the audience. He was also employed by the BBC as compere for a number of shows, including introducing The Beatles on their first London concert. As arguably the \\"folk world\\"'s then most competent performer in the area of jazzy guitar accompaniment he collaborated with fiddle player Dave Swarbrick on several ragtime tunes the 1967 Dave Swarbrick album \\"Rags, Reels & Airs\\" along with singer-guitarist Martin Carthy on the more folk-based material. Disley also played guitar accompaniment to Mike Absalom on the latter's 1968 album, Save the Last Gherkin for Me. By the 1970s, he was one of the folk scene's busiest artists and a mainstay of folk festivals as musician and compere. =Back to jazz with Stephane Grappelli= In 1973 he was influential in persuading Quintette du Hot Club de France violinist St√©phane Grappelli to return to public performances using an all- strings acoustic line-up, recreating the spirit of the Quintette for a new generation of listeners. Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \\"cocktail jazz\\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \\"warm up\\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United State. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \\"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\\" (the latter in September 1974). \\"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\\"Karl Dallas, Melody Maker July 27, 1974, \\"Disley - still making whoopee\\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist. The Disley Trio accompanied Grappelli for another five years until Disley was forced to take a break in 1979 after breaking his wrist when he was knocked down by a motorcycle in London. His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years. During that period, Disley continued to play folk clubs and festivals as a solo performer and also mentored a young Chris Newman, who would establish his own name in the swing jazz, guitar flatpicking and celtic folk guitar fields. Disley (right of centre) jams onstage with the Chris Newman group at the 1977 Cambridge Folk Festival In 1978 Grappelli, Disley, and others were invited by David Grisman to contribute the score to the film King of the Gypsies. Grappelli and Disley had walk-on parts as gypsy musicians and were suitably attired for the occasion, but the soundtrack to the movie was never released. Disley was back with Grappelli in 1981‚Äì2 with a visit to the U.S. which resulted in parts of two performances captured on film, later released as St√©phane Grappelli - Live in San Francisco although the two musicians parted ways soon after, this time for good. For the second concert performance (filmed at the Great American Music Hall), Grappelli and the Trio were joined for an encore by David Grisman, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, and Rob Wasserman for a performance of \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\". Diz Disley at the 1981 Essex Festival in his \\"folk entertainer\\" persona: \\"Just one drink to steady myself...\\" =After Grappelli= In the early 1980s Disley formed a working partnership with gypsy jazz guitar prodigy Bireli Lagrene, with whom he again toured the world, including a return visit to Carnegie Hall.The Daily Telegraph obituary, 12 April 2010, accessed 13 April 2010 In 1984 Disley was instrumental in forming a club quintet for Nigel Kennedy, who was starting to explore other musical styles. Musicians with Kennedy were Jeff Green, Ian Cruickshank, Nils Solberg (guitars), and Dave Etheridge (bass), who had played with Disley and Denny Wright on their 1973 tour with Grappelli. In 1986, Disley formed the Soho String Quintette with Johnny Van Derrick (violin), Nils Solberg, Jeff Green, and David Etheridge. Zing Went the Strings was issued by Waterfront Records. In the 1990s, during several years spent in Los Angeles, Disley recorded with blues saxophonist Big Jay McNeely and country-rockabilly musician Ray Campi. He painted several portraits of jazz musicians, including Illinois Jacquet, in the style of the Cubists. In the 2000s he spent time in Spain, where he had purchased land with the stated intention of building a golf course, He ran a jazz bar there between trips to the UK for continued performances. In early 2010 Disley's health took a turn for the worse, and he was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, England, on 2 February. He died on 21 March 2010. Guitar style Disley's style was frequently compared to Django Reinhardt's, particularly the single- string soloing. But he was also influenced by plectrum-style players such as Eddie Lang, Lonnie Johnson, and Teddy Bunn,MacKenzie chapter, p. 159 During the early part of his career, Disley developed an accompaniment style that incorporated complex and subtle jazz harmonies, the ability to play in any key anywhere on the instrument, including traditionally \\"non guitar-friendly\\" keys such as B flat and E flat, the choice of numerous alternate voicings for any chord, plus the incorporation of moving figures in the bassline and internal notes of chords. Although much of Disley's playing in this respect remains undocumented from his folk club years except for a few amateur recordings, the two tracks on Dave Swarbrick's Rags, Reels & Airs album give an indication of his swinging accompaniment. Much better documented are the years of Disley's association with Grappelli. His rhythm playing is notable for the lightness and propulsion engendered by his right hand technique while using Selmer/Maccaferri-style instruments noted for their projection and bright open tone, as well as choice of appropriate chord voicings. His contributions are most easily discernible in the solo introductions to certain swing tunes and in acoustic guitar solos backed by the other rhythm guitar and double bass. Anecdotes and personal reminiscences Disley was very much a one-off \\"character\\" and remembered for his personality traits and eccentricities. Contributors talk of his chaotic life. He had the ability to make large sums of money and then be completely penniless. He drove and slept in a Rolls Royce hearse with a sack of carrots and a juicer, believing that carrot juice would offset the effects of alcohol. He arrived at clubs and discovered he got the week of his performance wrong. He frequently arrived at folk clubs without his guitar, borrowing one from the audience, upon which he would play quite unaffected by any instrumental inadequacies. He addressed most people he met as \\"Dear Boy\\". His most frequent request was for an advance on his fee or to cash a check for the same purpose, which he would refer to in slang as \\"sausage me a gregory\\": sausage and mash for \\"cash\\", Gregory Peck for \\"check\\". David \\"Brillo\\" Etheridge (double bass) and Chris Newman (guitar) have spoken highly of his mentoring and sharing of his musical knowledge at formative stages in their careers.

He played for the Penrith Panthers in the New South Wales Rugby League competition in Australia as well as playing four games for the New South Wales State of Origin side. His position of choice was at centre. He is the brother of Scott, Craig and Grant Izzard. Playing career Izzard was a local junior for Penrith making his first grade debut for the club in the 1982 season. Izzard was called up to the New South Wales side in game one of State of Origin in his debut year playing on the wing though injury ruled him out of the remaining matches for his state and country played that year. Fitness problems went on to hamper his relationship with several of his coaches such as Tim Sheens and Ron Willey but playing under Phil Gould in 1991 his efforts on the field became instrumental in his team's success helping them to a grand final premiership victory. Following the grand final victory he travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan. The following season several neck injuries reduced the amount of time he was able to play eventually having to retire when it was revealed it was a chronic problem. At the time of his retirement in 1992 until Greg Alexander surpassed him in the 1998 season, he was the second most capped Penrith Panthers player behind Royce Simmons.

A Boghammar is a High Speed Patrol Boat for use in coastal patrol. The term Boghammar originated from the Iranian patrol boats manufactured by the Swedish company Boghammar Marin AB during the 1980s used in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and its Tanker War.  History  In 1983, Iran purchased 50 RL-118 and RL-130 patrol crafts from Boghammar Marin AB for reportedly $10 million. It was the biggest order ever for the shipyard, and was worth almost three times their annual revenues. By February 1987, The Washington Post reported that the newly-established Navy of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began using the boats. According to Svenska Dagbladet, American authorities maintained that Iran acquired at least a further 13 boats by way of Czechoslovakia.  Wider use  The term boghammar, sometimes spelled boghammer, has also come to mean an improvised naval fighting vessel, typically used by a local irregular military force and usually being a modified civilian boat or other similar machine. It is usually a speedboat or fast patrol boat (as used by police for harbor/river patrol) on which are mounted recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns, mortars, or other relatively small weapons systems. A boghammar is usually unarmoured. Boghammars, in this sense, have been used by paramilitary forces to attack offshore oil platforms and civilian shipping, or even larger military vessels, most notably by Iran in the Tanker War. Other users of such vessels include Nigerian militants, LTTE Sea Tigers, and Somali pirates.

It explores the stresses of police work in Los Angeles, California in the early 1960s. The author wrote the novel, his first, while he was still a working member of the Los Angeles Police Department. The novel was adapted as a film of the same name starring George C. Scott and Stacy Keach. Plot summary The novel is basically without plot, instead episodically depicting the psychological changes in three LAPD officers caused by their police work, and particularly the nature of police work in poor minority communities of Los Angeles. The three officers: Serge Duran, Gus Plebesly, and Roy Fehler, are classmates at the police academy in the summer of 1960, and the novel examines their lives each August of succeeding years, culminating in their on-the-job reunion during the Watts riots of August 1965. The New Centurions is likely the most autobiographical of Wambaugh's novels. He provides a straightforward narration of events with little use of flashback. Each chapter is written in the third-person from the point of view of one of the three protagonists. They have no contact with each other once they graduate from the academy, but their paths are similar and converging. Like Wambaugh, his protagonists move from a few years of uniformed patrol in minority districts to plainclothes assignments in juvenile and vice work, experiences which so affected Wambaugh that he returns to them repeatedly as plot elements in his fiction. Wambaugh also explores the officers' private lives, noting adultery, alcoholism, racism and suicide as rampant in the ranks of the LAPD. Police suicide, in particular, is a theme Wambaugh explores in nearly all of his books. A major theme explored throughout the book is what traits characterize a veteran officer, and how a rookie acquires them. Wambaugh consistently compares the attitudes of the new officers (one is not considered a veteran in the LAPD until one's fifth anniversary on the job) to those of the older entrenched men.  Character synopsis  =Serge Duran= Like Wambaugh, Duran came to the LAPD from the U.S. Marines, joining in 1954 right out of high school. Although Duran is a Chicano, he is described as having fair features and being tall. He speaks little Spanish. His first assignment is as uniformed patrol in Hollenbeck Division in East LA, and he resentfully notices that all the Chicanos in his class have been sent there. Duran is soon forced to confront his ethnicity, which he has hidden since leaving Chino to join the Marines. At first he rationalizes why he does not want to be taken as Hispanic, but is increasingly uncomfortable with his self-denial. While working Hollywood Division for a few months in 1962 before returning to Hollenbeck, Duran begins to see East LA in a new light, as a comfortable place where people are what they seem to be. Teamed with an older but passive and unambitious officer after his return, Duran is pleased to learn that his patrol partner recommended him for a detective position investigating felonies in the Chicano division. Duran settles into a routine in Hollenbeck, goes through relatively meaningless personal relationships, and becomes a Juvenile detective to avoid a transfer and to improve his resum√©. Wambaugh places much of the narrative around Duran in Mexican restaurants. In his favorite diner, Duran falls in love with the young Mexican waitress Mariana Paloma, who finally brings him to come to grips with his ethnicity. Of the three central characters, Duran is the least complex and well-delineated, possibly reflecting Wambaugh's difficulty in conveying ethnicity. Duran has the most vivid episodes in the novel's climax. He appears to be the character whom Wambaugh chooses to re- enact events which Wambaugh had undergone. =Gus Plebesly= Plebesly is middle class and suburban in upbringing, from Azusa. He married young and at 22 has two children. He worked in a bank before joining the LAPD, has earned a few college credits, but sought a job with higher status and better pay. Short and slim, Plebesly just passed the height and weight minimums required of applicants, but is a natural athlete and a distance runner. His first assignment tests his hidden fear of being a coward. Although he performed well in both physical training and defensive tactics at the academy, Plebesly is doubtful of his ability to defeat an opponent in a physical confrontation. His assignment to University Division (now LAPD's \\"Southwest Area\\") intensifies his fears. University is more than 90% black in population and has a high- crime rate, both conditions outside his experience. Plebesly is fortunate in that his first partner is the thoughtful and pragmatic veteran Andy Kilvinsky. He is featured briefly but is a crucial character. Close to retirement (which he refers to as \\"pulling the pin\\"), Klivinsky takes Plebesly under his wing to make into an extension of himself. He gives Plebesly a cram course in being a good cop, overcoming his self-doubts, and trusting his innate common sense. He warns Plebesly that the intensity of crime in University makes a year there the equivalent of ten years in any other. Always offering insights from his personal philosophy, Kilvinsky likens the role of LAPD cops to that of centurions during the early decline of the Roman Empire. But Kilvinsky also represents a warning, as he has focused on work, and long-divorced, not just from his wife but the rest of his family as well. After two years Plebesly becomes a veteran, breaking in new rookies using the words and examples of Kilvinsky, now retired and living alone in Oregon. University Division has become more tense and dangerous than ever and the center of Black Muslim challenges to white authority. Plebesly has observed decent young officers like Rantlee becoming racist, apparently helpless to stop their changes. He can absorb what he witnesses, but does not fall subject to the same bias. Feeling he married too young, he feels trapped in his marriage. The frequency of divorce among his peers bothers him, and when he takes an interest in another woman, his female partner in Juvenile Division, fate intervenes in the form of Kilvinsky's suicide. Plebesly learns about this indirectly, after his partner's will goes through probate. =Roy Fehler= Fehler, also married, dropped out of college out of boredom. Fehler had wandered into an academic major of criminology but had grown tired of college studies and joined the LAPD on the pretext of gaining several years' firsthand experience about crime and criminals. With little interest in the semi-military aspects of the police environment, firearms, or physical training, Fehler from the outset views himself as intellectually superior to his fellow cadets and later the officers he works with. Assigned to Newton Division, the poorest all-black division in the department, Fehler like Plebesly is also paired with a veteran officer nearing retirement, but the two experiences seemingly could not be more unalike. Whitey Duncan is an alcoholic, and as Fehler soon discovers, drinks on the job from bottles concealed inside police callboxes. Yet he exhibits an unpretentious street wisdom that Fehler in his conceit and scorn for Whitey misses entirely. Roy, who has considered himself reasonable and thoughtful in all respects that his peers are not, develops a negative attitude toward the department's bureaucratic indifference that rivals that of any twenty-year veteran. Fehler experiences a mutual but mild dislike with all his partners, who vary from night to night, and his marriage quickly disintegrates after the birth of his daughter Becky, who becomes the one brightness in an otherwise bleak existence. After two years in Newton he seemingly escapes to work Vice in downtown Central Division but it is only a reprieve. He is sent to Seventy- Seventh Division (Watts), considered a virtual war zone in the LAPD, and in Fehler's mind, ten times as bad as Newton. The transfer only deepens his cynicism and resentment. Distracted by a psychologically traumatic call concerning an abused infant, Fehler and his partner interrupt the robbery of a liquor store in the immediate aftermath of the call. Fehler is careless and is shot in the stomach by a blast from a sawed-off shotgun. He survives, but his long, painful recovery is as traumatizing as the injury. The wound is slow to heal, Fehler endures a colostomy, and he is forced to live with his parents, where his job and injury are scorned and ridiculed. Worst of all, when he finally returns to full duty, it is back to patrol in Seventy-Seventh. Deluding himself that he had avoided a dependency on drugs, Fehler begins drinking, hiding bottles in both the trunk of his car and in callboxes. Just twenty-six years of age, Roy Fehler has devolved into Whitey Duncan. Returning to college studies has become all but forgotten, and he reaches bottom when he is suspended for sixty days without pay for drinking on duty. Fehler's redemption begins when he takes a burglary report from a young black dental technician, Laura Hunt, and becomes infatuated with her. They fall in love and he moves in with her during his suspension, where she \\"dries him out\\". Rid of his arrogance and conceit, Roy believes he is finally \\"finding peace\\" with himself. The Watts riots Wambaugh tightly controls his narrative of the Watts riots, which provides the backdrop for the novel's 6th and final part. He participated in it personally as an officer. He gives a harrowing account from the perspectives of his three main characters. At the end, however, it is not violence on a large scale that has the most effect on the lives of the three officers, but an unexpected act of personal violence, small-scale by comparison. In the first chapter, the longest, the riot is revealed through the anxiety of Serge Duran, being held at Hollenbeck and waiting to have to enter it. Later, the nervous conversations of three officers thrown together in a radio car reveal aspects of the riot. They don't know where they are or what they should be doing. Leaderless, they finally fall in with a small collection of officers gathered by a sergeant and put down the looting in just one store on one block. They are stunned to realize that this show of authority is enough to \\"quell\\" most of the rioters in the area, some of whom are children. On his way home that night, Duran stops to eat. He orders menudo, a soup which has always represented his Chicano background, and finally identifies as Hispanic. In the second chapter, the shortest, Gus Plebesly and his temporary partners arrive at the same decision. Plebesly is sitting in the back seat, fearful of what tests lie ahead. But suddenly they confront a crowd trying to set fire to a grocery. The police interrupt them and chase them. Plebesly finally runs down not just one but three rioters, arresting them one at a time until he confronts the last. This man is much larger and more muscular than he, but he subdues him convincingly. Afterward Plebesly is still afraid and sometimes almost as panic-stricken as before, but he learns he can endure. Roy Fehler, in the third and next-to-last chapter, does little but observe. For half the chapter he is pinned down behind a fire engine by a sniper, protecting his stomach from further injury and reflecting that, even in the chaos of South Central Los Angeles, he has found peace in his life by being with Laura. A sergeant galvanizes the disorganized police remnants into action, but the night ends with an ugly incident. Roy's crew gets into a vehicle pursuit of looters, are almost machine-gunned at a National Guard roadblock, and then crash, looters escape when their car crashes. One of Roy's temporary partners shoots up the car and sets it afire. Soon after Roy goes home to Laura. He rejects her offer of a drink and her apology about the riot (she is black). Roy soaks in a hot bath and, finally relaxed, asks Laura to marry him. Adaptations In 1972 The New Centurions was adapted as a feature film released by Columbia Pictures, starring George C. Scott as Andy Kilvinsky and Stacy Keach as Roy Fehler. Columbia paid Wambaugh a bonus of $1,250.00 for each week the novel remained on the New York Times Best Seller list.

The moth uses a proboscis to feed itself nectar. Both males and females have a relatively long lifetime of 10 to 30 days. The female moths lay pellucid green eggs. Egg growth varies strongly from 3 to 21 days. There are at least two generations per year with peak flights from January to February and again from June to July. The larvae feed on Mesechites trifida. In its larval form, the Hemeroplanes triptolemus is capable of expanding its anterior body segments to give it the appearance of a snake, complete with eye patches. This snake mimicry extends even to the point where it will harmlessly strike at potential predators.

In World War I the brigade was in British India for most of the war and did not see service as a complete formation, but many of its battalions fought in the Middle East campaigns. The brigade (without its Devon or Cornwall battalions) did see action during the campaign in North West Europe of World War II, distinguishing itself at actions such as Operation Jupiter (Hill 112), the capture of Mont Pin√ßon, Operation Market Garden, at 'Dorset Wood' and at Hengelo. As 130 (West Country) Brigade it continued in the postwar TA until 1961. Volunteer Force The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for the part-time Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war.

The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry experienced a shortfall in volunteers, and so many Overseas Service men had to be transferred from the 1/5th DCLI to bring the 1/4th up to strength that the 1/5th was withdrawn from the Devon & Cornwall brigade and replaced by the 1/6th Devons on 16 September; 1/5th DCLI later became a pioneer battalion on the Western Front.DCLI at Long, Lnng Trail. On 24 September, at the special request of the Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, the Wessex Division accepted liability for service in British India to relieve the Regular units there for service on the Western Front. The division's infantry battalions (without their brigade headquarters) embarked at Southampton on 8 October and the were convoyed to Karachi (the Devon battalions) and Bombay (1/4th DCLI). They were immediately distributed to garrisons across India, reverting to peacetime service conditions, and the Devon & Cornwall Brigade never saw service as a whole, though it was formally numbered the 130th (Devon and Cornwall) Brigade in May 1915. As soon as the Wessex Division had left for India, the 2nd Wessex Division and its brigades began to be organised from the 2nd Line battalions being raised by the home depots. Recruitment and training of the 2nd Wessex Division proceeded so well that it was also sent to India in December 1914, and later received the notional titles of 45th (2nd Wessex) Division and 136th (2/1st Devon and Cornwall) Brigade.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 55‚Äì60.45th (2nd Wessex) Division at Long, Long Trail. Brigadier-General R.J. Pinney, who had commanded the Devon & Cornwall Brigade since 16 July 1913, took temporary command of the 2nd Wessex Division on its formation and Brig-Gen Lord St Levan (a retired colonel in the Grenadier Guards) commanded the 2/1st Devon and Cornwall Brigade until it embarked for India. By early 1915 the need was growing for troops to be sent from India to various theatres of war, and the first drafts and formed units from the Wessex Divisions began to go on active service, particularly to the Mesopotamian Front. By the end of the war only one battalion remained in India from the two Devon & Cornwall brigades. Interwar The TF (reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921) began to reform on 7 February 1920. 130th (Devon and Cornwall) Infantry Brigade in 43rd (Wessex) Division was composed as follows:Titles and Designations, 1927. * 4th Bn Devons * 5th Bn Devons * 6th Bn Devons * 4th/5th Bn DCLI (amalgamated 1921) World War II =Mobilisation= After the Munich Crisis in late 1938, when the possibility of another European conflict loomed, the TA was doubled in size, and once again its units formed duplicates. The TA's infantry units mobilised on 1 September 1939, two days before war was declared. At the time of mobilisation the duplicate 45th Division was still being organised, so both 1st and 2nd Line units were administered by 43rd (Wessex) Division HQ. Once the two were separated, the Devon and DCLI battalions were all assigned to 45th Division and 130th Infantry Brigade (the 'Devon and Cornwall' subtitle having been dropped) in 43rd (W) Division had the following organisation:Southern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Joslen, p. 320.Joslen, pp. 69‚Äì70.Joslen, pp. 73‚Äì4. * 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment * 5th Battalion, Dorset Regiment * 7th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment * 130th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company ‚Äì formed 17 May 1940, disbanded 20 December 1941 * Section, No 3 Company, 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) Lord & Watson, pp. 151‚Äì2, 262. =Home Defence= In May 1940 43rd (W) Division was preparing to go overseas to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, but the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May ended the 'Phoney War' before the division was ready. When the Battle of France was lost and the BEF was being evacuated from Dunkirk, 43rd (W) Division was one of the few reasonably well-equipped formations left in Home Forces to counter a German invasion of the United Kingdom. It formed part of the mobile GHQ Reserve disposed on the line from Northampton through North London to Aldershot, from which brigade groups could be despatched to any threatened area. During the period when invasion was most feared, the division was stationed just north of London.Collier, Chapter VII.Collier, Map 5. Collier, Map 6.Collier, Maps 17. By the end of 1940 the division was stationed in East Kent, where it remained for the next four years, first in defensive mode, later training intensively for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). It was later noted that its habitual training area round Stone Street, Kent, bore a marked resemblance to the Bocage countryside in Normandy where it would later fight.Joslen, pp. 69‚Äì70.Collier, Map 20.Collier, Map 27.Essame, pp. 2‚Äì3. =Normandy= 130th Brigade landed in Normandy on 24 June 1944,Essame, pp. 15‚Äì7. and for the rest of the North West Europe campaign its normal organisation for mobile operations was as follows:Essame, Appendix C.Ford, Appendix 1. 130 Infantry Brigade Group * Brigade HQ * Three infantry battalions * One machine gun company and one heavy mortar platoon from 8th Bn Middlesex Regiment * 112th (Wessex) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery * 233rd A/T Battery, 59th (Duke of Connaught's Hampshire) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery * One self-propelled (SP) troop from 361 LAA Battery, 110th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery * 553rd Field Company, Royal Engineers * Section, No 3 Company, 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Signals * 130th Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps * 505th Company, Royal Army Service Corps ‚Äì in the divisional administrative area * 130th Infantry Brigade Workshop, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers ‚Äì in the divisional administrative area Units from the supporting armoured brigade (31 Tank Brigade at Hill 112, usually 8 Armoured Brigade thereafter) would also be attached for specific operations. =Hill 112= Troops of 130 Brigade sheltering from mortar fire during Operation Jupiter, 10 July 1944. 130 Brigade was in reserve for the division's first action, Operation Epsom on 26 June,Essame, p. 29. but it was assigned a leading role on 10 July in Operation Jupiter, to take Hill 112. As the divisional historian remarked, the brigade's introduction to battle was 'both bloody and abrupt'.Essame, p. 38. The attack was supported by all the divisional artillery and mortars, plus the artillery of 15th (Scottish) Division and 11th Armoured Division and two Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs). 130 Brigade was to advance through Ch√¢teau de Fontaine to capture √âterville and Maltot and the high ground to the south-east of Hill 112. It was accompanied by Churchill tanks from 9th Royal Tank Regiment (9th RTR), M10 Achilles tank destroyers from 86th (5th Devon) A/T Regiment and Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks from 79th Armoured Division. The advance began at 05.00 and at first the brigade's attack went well, 5th Dorsets and C Squadron, 9th RTR, making good progress against the farms on the lower ground and taking the ruins of Ch√¢teau de Fontaine by 06.15. Brigadier Leslie then launched 4th Dorsets into √âterville. Casualties at first were light and the battalion began to consolidate the position, but a 'grim struggle for the far side of the village then developed'. Meanwhile, 7th Hampshires began the attack on Maltot. They got into the village, but many of the supporting tanks and M10s had been knocked out by crossfire from the uncaptured Hill 112 and from beyond √âterville. The leading Hampshires penetrated the village, leaving strongpoints to be mopped up later by the following Dorsets, but they were driven out by counter-attacks. 4th Dorsets, making their second attack of the day, suffered heavy casualties advancing to reach the isolated Hampshires without artillery support. A troop of towed anti-tank guns of 86th A/T Regiment was brought up to place an anti-tank screen round the south of the village while 4th Dorsets fought to suppress the strongpoints inside the village. The anti-tank troop was overrun by a German counter-attack, and after firing all their small arms ammunition the crews had to remove the breechblocks from their guns and retreat to the infantry's slit trenches. The situation in Maltot became untenable, and the surviving troops were withdrawn. 5th Dorsets and 7th Somerset Light Infantry (SLI) from 214 Brigade had a tough fight until the following morning to maintain the positions round √âterville. The division then had to hold its positions under mortar fire for another 14 days, described by the divisional history as comparable only 'to the bombardment at Passchendaele'. Only on 22 July did a final set-piece attack by 129 Brigade (Operation Express) finally succeed in capturing Maltot.Buckley, p. 92.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 317‚Äì8.Essame, pp. 37‚Äì50.Saunders, Hill 112. =Mont Pin√ßon= After a short rest 43rd (Wessex) Division moved west to launch an attack towards the dominating height of Mont Pin√ßon as part of Operation Bluecoat. Starting at 08.00 on 30 July, the division was to force its way through enemy positions at Briquessard and advance through Cahagnes towards Ondefontaine. 130 Brigade led, reinforced by 4th SLI and Sherman tanks of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, followed by the other brigades. Initial casualties were heavy, particularly from mines, and 5th Dorsets attacking on the right soon ran into trouble. On the left 4th Dorsets opened the way for 7th Hampshires to advance on Cahagnes, but it took the accompanying tanks several hours to negotiate the difficult country. The advance achieved only on the first day. and it took until the following morning to clear the mines and restart the advance with 214 Brigade.Buckley, pp. 153‚Äì7.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 388‚Äì90.Essame, pp. 53‚Äì7.Hunt, pp 29‚Äì40, 57‚Äì9. The division fought its way forward during the next few days to the foot of Mont Pin√ßon. 130 Brigade got into Ondefontaine on 3 August, and next day pushed through the woods beyond.Essame, pp. 58‚Äì69.Hunt, pp. 61‚Äì2, 77‚Äì9. A new attack was planned for 6 August, with 130 Brigade making a feint to the north, while 129 Brigade continued from the west. During the day 130 Bde made substantial progress, diverting German defenders from the main thrust. It continued next day, while the dominating position of Mont Pin√ßon fell to a surprise attack, by 129 Bde and its supporting tanks.Buckley, pp. 167‚Äì8.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 409‚Äì10.Essame, pp. 67‚Äì72.Hunt, pp. 93‚Äì130, 139‚Äì44. Having taken Mont Pin√ßon, 43rd (W) Division participated in the pursuit of the broken enemy, who were soon caught in the Falaise pocket.Buckley, pp. 180‚Äì1.Essame, pp. 73‚Äì89. However, the divisional commander, Maj-Gen Ivor Thomas, considered that Brig Leslie was dilatory in attacking on 13 August and sacked him. He was temporarily replaced by the senior battalion commander, Lt-Col Basil Coad ('Daddy Coad') from 5th Dorsets, until Brig. B.B. Walton arrived three days later.Christopherson, pp. 418‚Äì9. =Vernon Bridge= On 27 August 1944 4th Dorsets cross the Class 9 bridge 'David' at Vernon, decorated with the Wessex Wyvern divisional badge.Ford. After the breakout from the Normandy beachhead, 43rd (W) Division was sent ahead to make an assault crossing of the River Seine at Vernon. US troops had already reached the west bank of the Seine, so the convoys of assault troops and bridging material moving eastwards had to be carefully coordinated to cross with US convoys repositioning to the south. 130 Brigade was in Group 3, a convoy of just over 1000 vehicles including 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops Royal Engineers who were to operate tank rafts and build a heavy Bailey Bridge. The leading group arrived at Vernon on the afternoon of 25 August and began the assault that evening. By 10.00 on 27 August a bridgehead had been secured, the first light bridge (named 'David') was ready, tanks were being ferried across and 130 Bde was assembling in Vernon to be passed across the river when required. The troops in the bridgehead drove off a determined counter-attack, the light bridge (damaged by shellfire) was repaired, and the first 40-ton Bailey ('Goliath') was completed by 19.30. Some of the brigade's troops had already crossed on 'David'; now the rest of the brigade streamed across 'Goliath' and next morning began the breakout. 4th Dorsets cleared the high ground of Germans who had troubled the bridgehead, then 5th Dorsets passed through to capture the villages beyond. 7th Hampshire fought the remains of the defending German battlegroup and captured Tilly. That afternoon, XXX Corps passed through and resumed the pursuit. After the Seine crossing, 43rd (W) Division was 'grounded' while the rest of XXX Corps raced across northern France and Belgium.Buckley, pp. 184‚Äì9.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 453‚Äì5, 465‚Äì6.Essame, pp. 90‚Äì111.Ford, pp. 141, 165‚Äì6, 176. =Market Garden= By the time 43rd (W) Division next moved, the war was already away. The first element of 130 Bde to move up was 7th Hampshires, sent on 8 September to reinforce the garrison of liberated Brussels. The whole of the brigade was near Brussels by 11 September, and then 43rd (W) Division concentrated at Diest to take part in Operation Market Garden, beginning on 17 September. In 'Garden', the ground part of the operation, XXX Corps was to link river crossings up to the Nederrijn at Arnhem via a 'carpet' of airborne troops. 43rd (W) Division accompanied by 8 Armoured Bde was to follow Guards Armoured Division, carrying out assault crossings if any of the bridges were found to be destroyed, and protecting the 'corridor' to Arnhem. The division waited as the advance got under way, then on 20 September 130 Bde received orders to move up. The advance up the only road ('Club Route') was painfully slow for the infantry, who were being carried in amphibious DUKWs ready for river crossings, and night found the head of the brigade group still at the great bridge at Grave. Next morning 4th Dorsets took over responsibility for the bridges at Grave and Neerbosch while the rest of 130 Bde caught up with the Guards at Nijmegen. There were no Germans left in Nijmegen and by early afternoon 5th Dorsets had established a tight bridgehead on the north bank of the Waal, while 7th Hampshires guarded the south bank. 214 Brigade passed through at dawn next day and followed the Guards who were held up by fierce resistance on 'The Island' between the Waal and the Nederrijn. 130 Brigade was then relieved at Nijmegen and followed up in DUKWs. At Valburg on 23 September its leading battalion, 5th Dorsets, was cut in half by a German tank attack supported by artillery. While the head of the battalion carried on to link up with the Polish Parachute Brigade at Driel, the rest of the brigade had to fight hard to clear Valburg crossroads. When they got through, 4th Dorsets delivered assault boats to the Poles, a few of whom managed to get across the river. On 24 September the decision was made to evacuate the survivors of 1st Airborne Division. That night, under an intense barrage, 4th Dorsets and the Polish crossed the river to establish a new bridgehead from which to carry out the evacuation. The Dorsets' crossing was a disaster; the assault boats were late arriving, the opposite bank was strongly defended and the two leading companies were scattered and destroyed. The rest of the battalion was pinned down, and the DUKWs carrying stores could not mount the river banks. The following night the final evacuation of the airborne bridgehead was carried out by the Royal Engineers, covered by 130 Bde; around 2300 survivors of 1st Airborne and the Poles were ferried back to the south bank; few of 4th Dorsets made it back.Buckley, pp. 228‚Äì30.Ellis, Germany, pp. 42‚Äì3.Essame, pp. 113‚Äì38.Horrocks, pp. 221‚Äì6.Ryan, pp. 462‚Äì5, 477‚Äì8, 486, 489, 509‚Äì13, 515‚Äì31. In the aftermath of Market Garden, 43rd (W) Division was stationed on The Island, with 130 Bde still in its exposed positions along the Nederrijn, subject to mortar, machine gun and shell fire. On the night of 26/27 September German troops infiltrated the outposts of 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment to the left (west) and a sharp fight broke out. Brig Walton ordered 7th Hampshires to intervene and recapture Randwijk. Heavy losses were sustained among the houses as the battle escalated, but by midday the ad hoc group of units from 43rd (W) Division had eliminated the German bridgehead.Essame, pp. 139‚Äì43 The Germans launched more a serious counter- attack from the east on 1 October, with 116th Panzer Division attacking 130 Bde. 5th Dorsets beat off this attack, but a German party infiltrated into some factory buildings and fortified themselves in brick kilns. 7th Hampshires had to dislodge these troops with the help of RAF Typhoons. On 5 October 43rd (W) handed most of its positions over to the US 101st Airborne Division, but 5th Dorsets had difficulty extricating themselves from their exposed positions round Driel. The battalion left its anti-tank and mortar platoons to help the Americans and fighting continued for another day before the offensive ended. 130 Brigade then relieved the US 82nd Airborne Division on the Groesbeek heights that it had captured during Market Garden. As 43rd (W) Division settled down to hold this static line during the autumn, it rotated its brigades every seven days.Essame, pp. 144‚Äì7, 151‚Äì2. Basil Coad was promoted to brigadier and took permanent command of 130 Bde on 7 October. =Dorset Wood= Universal Carriers of 43rd (Wessex) Division negotiate a muddy lane during the advance to Geilenkirchen, 18 November 1944. In November 43rd (W) Division was shifted east for Operation Clipper to capture the Geilenkirchen salient. 130 Brigade's task was to capture Bauchem on the afternoon of 18 November. The village was first subjected to a massive bombardment to protect the flank of 214 Bde attacking Gilrath and Neiderheide, then 130 Bde was due to pass through Gilrath at 15.30 to begin its own attack. The leading battalion, 5th Dorsets, found the village so congested that its supporting tanks from 13th/18th Hussars could not get through. The CO found a route round the village and the attack went in promptly. The battalion took the village and 182 prisoners for just four casualties. However, progress elsewhere was slow on the second day and 130 Bde's attack was cancelled. Instead, 5th Dorsets with the 13th/18th Hussars tanks were tasked with clearing the woods between Tripsrath and Hatterath to secure 214 Bde's position. The battalion advanced under cover of smoke, but once in the woods it was pinned down at a clearing until nightfall when it completed its objectives. The fighting in the woods next day was vicious: once 5th Dorsets reached the edge of the woods they could see the open country behind, but were forced to dig in under heavy fire. Next day the battalion was relieved by 4th Dorsets, who continued the grim defence of what became known as 'Dorset Wood'. Once Geilenkirchen had been captured, 43rd (W) Division then had to defend the ground in conditions resembling the worst of the Western Front in World War I. The division was moved to the Maas as a reserve during the German Ardennes Offensive but was not engaged.Ellis, Germany, p. 161.Essame, pp. 162, 166, 168‚Äì76, 182, 187‚Äì90.Horrocks, pp. 233‚Äì5. =Roer Triangle= 43rd (Wessex) Division returned to the offensive in early 1945 in Operation Blackcock to reduce the Roer Triangle. The operation was launched on 16 January and 43rd (W) Division came up on the right of 52nd (Lowland) Division on 20 January. 130 Brigade launched 4th Dorsets at Schier Waldenrath at dawn the next day behind an impressive barrage and carried by Kangaroo Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) of 1st Canadian APC Regiment. Opposition was light, the main problems coming from booby-traps and mines. 5th Dorsets then marched up to relieve 4th SLI at Langbroich while the Kangaroos returned to bring up 7th Hampshires for next day's attack on Waldenrath. The attack by 7th Hampshires on 22 January was a major success: supported by a massive barrage and by Crocodile flamethrowers, the APC-borne infantry swept through Putt and fought their way into Waldenrath, taking 200 prisoners at a cost of 30 casualties. The rest of 43rd (W) Division then continued the advance, though exploitation was prevented by bad weather. 130 Brigade pushed on again on 25 January, but was stopped by ice and mines. The brigade then established defensive positions hidden on reverse slopes and came under the temporary command of 52nd (L) Division from 28 January to 2 February.Buckley, pp. 265‚Äì8.Ellis, Germany, pp. 241‚Äì7.Essame, pp. 197‚Äì200. =Reichswald= Shermna tank passing infantry of 43rd Wessex Division on the way to Goch, 17 February 1945. XXX Corps was next tasked with clearing the Reichswald up to the Rhine as part of Operation Veritable. Five divisions made the initial assault on 8 February, with 43rd (W) Division due to pass through on the second day to capture Goch. Although 15th (S) Division achieved all its objectives on 8 February, the roads collapsed into mud and progress was held up on the second day. By the time 43rd (W) was launched, only one congested road was open through the heavily-bombed town of Kleve, and the whole division was strung out, with 130 Bde still in Nijmegen. It was left as a reserve for 53rd (Welsh) Division, and it was not until 15 February that it got through to join in the fighting. At first light 4th Dorsets in the lead passed through the exhausted 129 Bde and found itself in a fierce fight with fresh German troops. It pushed on slowly until 7th Hampshires took over the lead in the afternoon, followed in turn by 5th Dorsets. 5th Dorsets arrived just as a night counter-attack came in against 7th Hampshires, but put in a fresh attack with tanks at 09.30 next morning, just in time to clear the start line for 214 Bde's follow-up attack. On 17 February 130 Bde cleared Forst Kleve, but there was little opposition after the wood had been blasted by RAF Typhoons and Canadian rocket projectors (the Land mattress). 43rd (W) Division had now 'rolled up' of the Siegfried Line defences and cleared the escarpment overlooking Goch.Buckley, pp. 274‚Äì7.Ellis, Germany, pp. 261‚Äì76.Essame, pp. 202‚Äì22.Horrocks, pp. 250‚Äì5. On 20 February 130 Bde was pulled out and sent to relieve a Canadian brigade holding a 'watery wilderness' north of Kleve, where the troops had to be taken in aboard Buffalo amphibious vehicles and contact patrols between the isolated companies had to be carried out by boat. The brigade remained here until 11 March, while the rest of the division completed the advance to Xanten on the Rhine. Contact with the enemy was close, but 130 Bde had no artillery support other than Bofors guns of 110th LAA Regiment firing in a ground role.Essame, pp. 223‚Äì4. =Across the Rhine= 43rd (Wessex) Division was given a follow-up task in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). 130 Brigade crossed the river in Buffaloes on 25 March behind 51st (Highland) Division, which had carried out the assault on the night of 23/24 March. 5th Dorsets found themselves in immediate combat without time to reconnoitre, but captured Androp with a night attack, allowing the rest of the brigade to clear Millingen next day. The remainder of the division crossed the bridges that had been erected and advanced to the Ijssel. 130 Brigade then retook the lead on 28 March, with 4th Dorsets capturing Landford on the west bank of the Ijssel before nightfall while 7th Hampshire protected the flank. 5th Dorsets then carried out an opposed landing by assault boats in the dark and its pioneer platoon built a light bridge to allow the battalion anti-tank guns to cross. By 08.30 on 29 March the divisional Royal Engineers had completed a Class 40 Bailey Bridge and the pursuit across Germany could begin.Ellis, Germany, pp. 293‚Äì4.Essame, pp. 233‚Äì40.Horrocks, pp. 261‚Äì2. Men of 7th Hampshires advance from Enschede to Hengelo, 3 April 1945. During the subsequent pursuit, 43rd (Wessex) Division was given the task of opening 'Club Route' for XXX Corps. The division was divided into five battle groups for the first drive, incorporating units of 8 Armoured Brigade. 130 Brigade constituted the fourth group. The leading group reached the Twente Canal on 2 April, finding the bridges destroyed. 130 Brigade was therefore brought up to make a crossing at Hengelo, with the tanks of the Sherwood Rangers and 12th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) attached from 8 Armoured Bde. Rather than a frontal assault, the brigade was sent round to attack from Enschede. The divisional history records that the flank march by cross-country tracks in pouring rain and pitch darkness was a 'remarkable achievement'. At 09.00 next morning 5th Dorsets were launched straight down the road into Hengelo, sweeping aside the resistance while 7th Hampshires enveloped the town from the north. With the canal defences turned, and a bridging site captured, there was no need for an artillery bombardment: the grateful townsfolk later named some of their streets 'Dorset', 'Hampshire' and 'Wessex'.Essame, pp. 241‚Äì7. The pursuit continued through April, 130 Bde with the Sherwood Rangers and 12th KRRC taking the direct road, 'Heart Route' and reaching L√∂ningen on 11 April. Here a deliberate attack had to be made by 4th Dorsets against a company of German officer cadets. Then 7th Hampshires pushed ahead on foot, filling cratered roads as they went. Next day 5th Dorsets and the Sherwood Rangers advanced against rearguards. With several British divisions converging on Bremen 43rd (W) was squeezed out, but 130 Bde continued under the command of 52nd (L) Division, which was now in the lead.Essame, pp. 251‚Äì7.Horrocks, pp. 261‚Äì2. Bremen having ignored a summons to surrender, XXX Corps pushed on into the outskirts, 130 Bde reverting to 43rd (W) Division's command to advance through spasmodic resistance to cut the Hamburg‚ÄìBremen Autobahn. Bremen was secured by 28 April and next day XXX Corps continued its drive into the Cuxhaven peninsula. 130 Brigade led 43rd (W) Division, following immediately behind the Reconnaissance Regiment. 5th Dorsets ran into heavy shellfire from the rearguard of 15th Panzergrenadier Division and fighting went on all night. Further progress was hampered. by cratered roads and blown bridges. 130 Brigade had secured a bridgehead over the Hamme Canal on 4 May and the rest of the division was preparing to move on Bremerhaven next day when news arrived of the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath.Christopherson, pp. 499‚Äì500, 504‚Äì7.Ellis, Germany, pp. 311‚Äì6, 339‚Äì40.Essame, pp. 251‚Äì70.Horrocks, pp. 262‚Äì6. After a period as occupation forces in XXX Corps' district, with 130 Bde coming under the temporary command of 51st (H) Division (6‚Äì18 May), 43rd (Wessex) Division's HQ and TA units were demobilised at the war's end. =Commanders= The following officers commanded 130th Infantry Brigade during World War II: * Brig. H.S.Woodhouse * Brig. B.K.Young * Brig. F.Y.C.Knox * Brig. N.D.Leslie * Brig. B.B.Walton * Brig. B.A.Coad Postwar When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947, 130 (West Country) Infantry Brigade was reformed in 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division with the following composition:Watson, TA 1947. * 4th Bn Devons at Exeter * 5th Bn Devons at Plymouth * 4th/5th Bn DCLI at Truro * 4th Bn Dorsets at Dorchester * 130 Brigade Signals, RCS, at Torquay ‚Äì became 342 Signal Squadron in 1959Lord & Watson, pp. 152, 206. On 15 May 1950 all three TA battalions of the Devons merged to form a single 4th Bn, reducing 130 Bde to the normal three-battalion establishment. In 1961 the division was reduced to a district headquarters as 43rd Division/District, and it was disbanded on the reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967.Lord & Watson, p. 152.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 288‚Äì9.

It burns natural gas in eight steam turbines to generate up to 1,280 MW of electricity. The gas is supplied via the SEAGas pipeline from Victoria, and the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System (MAPS) from Moomba in the Cooper Basin. The station is capable of burning either natural gas or fuel oil. It is the largest power station in South Australia and was formerly the largest single power station user of natural gas in Australia. Construction Construction began in 1963 following passing of a government act vesting the land and authorising construction. The 480 MW (4 x 120MW) A Station was completed in 1967, and construction of the 800 MW (4 x 200MW) B Station was completed in 1976. Planned shutdown In December 2014 AGL announced that it intended mothballing the four older units of the A Station indefinitely, having taken them out of service between July and September 2014. This decision was primarily driven by increasing levels of wind and solar generation in the South Australian region of the National Electricity Market displacing fossil fuel generation, particularly higher cost gas-fired generation. AGL reviewed this decision and deferred the planned mothballing in June 2016, following the closure of Alinta's Northern and Playford B coal-fired power stations at Port Augusta However, due to the state-wide power outage in September 2016, the system operator AEMO demanded that the Torrens Island power station to be brought back online to prevent another statewide power outage. AGL announced on 7 June 2017 that it intended to permanently mothball two of the turbines in the 50-year-old Torrens A power station from 1 July 2019, after building a new 210MW power station containing twelve gas reciprocating engines to be known as Barker Inlet Power Station adjacent to the Torrens Island site. The remaining two units of Torrens Island A are planned to be mothballed after winter 2020 and winter 2021.

He returned to Frankfurt in 1824 where art history evermore occupied his interest. His Tour of a German artist in England (1833 in German; 1836 translated into English by Lady Eastlake) remains a significant source for art historians, as do his catalogues of old master prints, whose numbering is still followed by some collections. In the year 1839 he became Inspektor (curator) of the St√§delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt. There he acquired important works in the prints and drawing area, mounted exhibitions, and taught. Passavant developed the three principal genres of art writing important for the next two centuries: the scholarly artistic biography, the aesthetic travelogue, and the reference survey. As a historian, he followed the romantic tradition.

The theorem states that: :Linear numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations (PDE's), having the property of not generating new extrema (monotone scheme), can be at most first-order accurate. Professor Sergei K. Godunov originally proved the theorem as a Ph.D. student at Moscow State University. It is his most influential work in the area of applied and numerical mathematics and has had a major impact on science and engineering, particularly in the development of methods used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other computational fields. One of his major contributions was to prove the theorem (Godunov, 1954; Godunov, 1959), that bears his name. The theorem We generally follow Wesseling (2001). Aside Assume a continuum problem described by a PDE is to be computed using a numerical scheme based upon a uniform computational grid and a one-step, constant step-size, M grid point, integration algorithm, either implicit or explicit. Then if x_{j} = j\\\\,\\\\Delta x and t^{n} = n\\\\,\\\\Delta t , such a scheme can be described by : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=1}^{M} {\\\\beta _m } \\\\varphi _{j + m}^{n + 1} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=1}^{M} {\\\\alpha _m \\\\varphi _{j + m}^n }. \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 1) In other words, the solution \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} at time n + 1 and location j is a linear function of the solution at the previous time step n. We assume that \\\\beta _m determines \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} uniquely. Now, since the above equation represents a linear relationship between \\\\varphi _j^{n } and \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} we can perform a linear transformation to obtain the following equivalent form, :\\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_m^{M} {\\\\gamma _m \\\\varphi _{j + m}^n }. \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 2) Theorem 1: Monotonicity preserving The above scheme of equation (2) is monotonicity preserving if and only if :\\\\gamma _m \\\\ge 0,\\\\quad \\\\forall m . \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 3) Proof - Godunov (1959) Case 1: (sufficient condition) Assume (3) applies and that \\\\varphi _j^n is monotonically increasing with j . Then, because \\\\varphi _j^n \\\\le \\\\varphi _{j + 1}^n \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le \\\\varphi _{j + m}^n it therefore follows that \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} \\\\le \\\\varphi _{j + 1}^{n + 1} \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le \\\\varphi _{j + m}^{n + 1} because : \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} - \\\\varphi _{j - 1}^{n + 1} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_m^{M} {\\\\gamma _m \\\\left( {\\\\varphi _{j + m}^n - \\\\varphi _{j + m - 1}^n } \\\\right)} \\\\ge 0 . \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 4) This means that monotonicity is preserved for this case. Case 2: (necessary condition) We prove the necessary condition by contradiction. Assume that \\\\gamma _p^{} < 0 for some p and choose the following monotonically increasing \\\\varphi_j^n \\\\quad , :\\\\varphi _i^n = 0, \\\\quad i < k;\\\\quad \\\\varphi _i^n = 1, \\\\quad i \\\\ge k . \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 5) Then from equation (2) we get : \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} - \\\\varphi _{j-1}^{n+1} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_m^M {\\\\gamma _m } \\\\left( {\\\\varphi _{j + m}^{n} - \\\\varphi _{j + m - 1}^{n} } \\\\right) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {0,} & {\\\\left[ {j + m e k} \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\gamma _m ,} & {\\\\left[ {j + m = k} \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right . \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 6) Now choose j=k-p , to give : \\\\varphi _{k-p}^{n + 1} - \\\\varphi _{k-p-1}^{n + 1} = {\\\\gamma _p \\\\left( {\\\\varphi _{k}^n - \\\\varphi _{k - 1}^n } \\\\right)} < 0 , \\\\quad \\\\quad ( 7) which implies that \\\\varphi _j^{n + 1} is NOT increasing, and we have a contradiction. Thus, monotonicity is NOT preserved for \\\\gamma _p < 0 , which completes the proof. Theorem 2: Godunov‚Äôs Order Barrier Theorem Linear one-step second-order accurate numerical schemes for the convection equation : {{\\\\partial \\\\varphi } \\\\over {\\\\partial t}} + c{ { \\\\partial \\\\varphi } \\\\over {\\\\partial x}} = 0 , \\\\quad t > 0, \\\\quad x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\quad \\\\quad (10) cannot be monotonicity preserving unless :\\\\sigma = \\\\left c \\\\right{{\\\\Delta t} \\\\over {\\\\Delta x}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{ N} , \\\\quad \\\\quad (11) where \\\\sigma is the signed Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy condition (CFL) number. Proof - Godunov (1959) Assume a numerical scheme of the form described by equation (2) and choose :\\\\varphi \\\\left( {0,x} \\\\right) = \\\\left( {{x \\\\over {\\\\Delta x}} - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4}, \\\\quad \\\\varphi _j^0 = \\\\left( {j - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4} . \\\\quad \\\\quad (12) The exact solution is : \\\\varphi \\\\left( {t,x} \\\\right) = \\\\left( {{{x - ct} \\\\over {\\\\Delta x}} - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4} . \\\\quad \\\\quad (13) If we assume the scheme to be at least second-order accurate, it should produce the following solution exactly : \\\\varphi _j^1 = \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4}, \\\\quad \\\\varphi _j^0 = \\\\left( {j - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4}. \\\\quad \\\\quad (14) Substituting into equation (2) gives: : \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_m^{M} {\\\\gamma _m \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\left( {j + m - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}}. \\\\quad \\\\quad (15) Suppose that the scheme IS monotonicity preserving, then according to the theorem 1 above, \\\\gamma _m \\\\ge 0 . Now, it is clear from equation (15) that : \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4} \\\\ge 0, \\\\quad \\\\forall j . \\\\quad \\\\quad (16) Assume \\\\sigma > 0, \\\\quad \\\\sigma otin \\\\mathbb{ N} and choose j such that j > \\\\sigma > \\\\left( j - 1 \\\\right) . This implies that \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma } \\\\right) > 0 and \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma - 1} \\\\right) < 0 . It therefore follows that, : \\\\left( {j - \\\\sigma - {1 \\\\over 2}} \\\\right)^2 - {1 \\\\over 4} = \\\\left( j - \\\\sigma \\\\right) \\\\left(j - \\\\sigma - 1 \\\\right) < 0, \\\\quad \\\\quad (17) which contradicts equation (16) and completes the proof. The exceptional situation whereby \\\\sigma = \\\\left c \\\\right{{\\\\Delta t} \\\\over {\\\\Delta x}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} is only of theoretical interest, since this cannot be realised with variable coefficients.

One of the best players in the world in his position in the 1990s, Benarrivo was an energetic attacking full-back capable of operating on both wings; he began his career with Brindisi in 1986, and later moved to Padova in 1989. He came to prominence during his time with Parma, joining the club in 1991; he won several domestic and European titles with the team and eventually became the club's record appearance holder in Serie A and in European competitions. At international level, Benarrivo represented Italy at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final. Club career Benarrivo started playing with the professional football team of his city, Brindisi, in Serie C1, during the 1986‚Äì87 season. After three seasons playing in Apulia, he went to play for Padova in Serie B, where he remained for two years, attracting much attention from larger Italian clubs. In 1991, Benarrivo was bought by Parma under Nevio Scala; that year, he would help his new team to qualify for the UEFA Cup in his first year in Serie A. He quickly became one of the strongest players of the Emilian side, which achieved notable domestic and European successes over the next decade. In his first year in the highest division, Bennarivo won the 1992 Italian Cup, and the following year, during the 1992‚Äì93 season, he won the 1993 Cup Winners' Cup. He reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final during the 1993‚Äì94 season and was defeated, although he was able to capture the European Supercup with the club in 1993. The series of thrilling triumphs he endured during his time at Parma, which culminated in the UEFA Cup victory during the 1994‚Äì95 season, as well as another Coppa Italia final, were not quite replicated in Serie A, however. Although Parma managed to navigate the top spots of the table during these seasons, they were not able to beat the dominant Milan and Juventus sides to the Serie A title, with their best finish coming during the 1996‚Äì97 season, where they finished the league in second place, qualifying for the 1997‚Äì98 UEFA Champions League; they also managed a third-place finish during the 1994‚Äì95 season, as well as several fourth-place finishes during this time, usually achieving European qualification. Benarrivo experienced another successful year with the club during the 1998‚Äì99 season. Parma finished fourth place in the league, but Benarrivo finished the season with the conquest of his second UEFA Cup and Italian Cup titles, following these successes up with the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana, a title which had evaded him in 1995. This would be his final season as an indisputable starter, however, and the following seasons would see him play with less regularity. During the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Parma finished in fourth place yet again, and narrowly missed out on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League after losing out to Inter in the playoff match. Parma managed their third consecutive fourth-place finish in the league during the 2000‚Äì01 season, also reaching another Coppa Italia final, only to be defeated by Fiorentina. Benarrivo managed to add another trophy to his club silverware, however, with a third Italian Cup in 2002. Benarrivo retired from professional football in 2004. With the Emilian club, he collected 257 appearances in Serie A, scoring 5 goals, and is the club's record appearance holder in the top-tier of Italian football. Following his retirement, he worked as a coach. International career Benarrivo played with the national team a total of 23 times, and for a period, he was the starting right-back for the Italians. He made his debut on 22 September 1993 under manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Estonia. He took part in the 1994 FIFA World Cup with Italy, where they reached the final only to lose out to Brazil on penalties. Benarrivo was a key member of the starting line-up for the 1994 World Cup, also featuring in the final defeat, and demonstrating his tactical versatility as he alternated between playing on the right and the left flanks. During the tournament, he notably won a penalty in extra time during the round of 16 match against Nigeria, from which Roberto Baggio subsequently scored, sending the Italians to the quarter-finals. Benarrivo played with the national side until 1997, making his final appearance on 29 October, against Russia. Playing style Although he was usually deployed on the right, Benarrivo was comfortable playing on both flanks. An energetic offensive full-back, he was known for his attacking prowess, despite rarely scoring, and was sometimes employed as a wing-back, or as a makeshift wide midfielder, due to his pace, stamina, offensive capabilities, technique, crossing accuracy and ability to cover the flank both offensively and defensively. These attributes led him to be considered one of the best players in his position during the 1990s.

The territories of the Left Bank of the Rhine, which French troops had conquered in 1795, had been returned to German (mostly Prussian) control after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, forming the Rhine Province. After a diplomatic defeat in the Oriental Crisis of 1840 France shifted its focus to the Rhine, and the French government, led by Adolphe Thiers, restated its claim to areas on the left bank, to re-establish the Rhine as a natural border. These claims reinforced ressentiment among the Germans against the French, and increased nationalism on both sides. New nationalist songs were written in France and Germany and achieved huge popularity, most famously the German songs \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\", \\"Der Deutsche Rhein\\" and the \\"Lied der Deutschen\\", the national anthem of Germany since 1922. In the end the crisis passed without war breaking out, though it again established the importance of the Rhine in European culture and politics. Background The Rhine as France's eastern border, 1806 The Greek War of Independence and the Russo- Turkish War (1828‚Äì29) had considerably weakened the Ottoman Empire, and after Sultan Mahmud II refused to acknowledge Muhammad Ali Pasha (viceroy of the Ottoman territory Egypt) as the Stadtholder of Syria, Egyptian troops moved into Palestine and Syria, reaching Anatolia by 1832. France had used the Turkish defeat in the Greek War of Independence to occupy Algeria, in 1830, and regarded Muhammad Ali Pasha as an ideal partner, supporting him in his effort to rid himself once and for all of his Ottoman overlord. France's political goals were to bring Mediterranean Africa beyond Suez under its sphere of influence. When Muhammad Ali won a victory over the Ottoman sultan in 1839, the Oriental Crisis of 1840 was born. The United Kingdom, Russia, Prussia, and Austria considered that the fall of the Ottoman Empire would entail unacceptable consequences, and signed the 1840 Convention of London, which would stabilize the Empire and demanded from France that it withdraw its support for Egypt's claims. British military assistance for the Ottomans forced Muhammad Ali Pasha to give up Syria and Palestine and limit his authority to Egypt, which remained under Ottoman overlordship (in return, his rule became hereditary). Rhine crisis But before the crises over the Dardanelles and the Rhine could escalate into a European war, the Thiers government, whose politics of prestige had started the crisis in the first place, was brought down. A new cabinet, with Guizot as Secretary of State, sailed a more conciliatory course, and the London Straits Convention (13 July 1841) settled the matter of the Dardanelles, defusing tension in Europe. In Germany the consequences of the Rhine crisis were described thus by Heinrich Heine: \\"Thiers drummed our fatherland into this great movement which awakened political life in Germany; Thiers brought us back on our feet as a nation.\\" The crisis led the German Confederation to extend the fortifications of Mainz, Ulm, and Rastatt, while the Kingdom of Bavaria built the fortress at Germersheim.

In the mathematical theory of stochastic processes, local time is a stochastic process associated with semimartingale processes such as Brownian motion, that characterizes the amount of time a particle has spent at a given level. Local time appears in various stochastic integration formulas, such as Tanaka's formula, if the integrand is not sufficiently smooth. It is also studied in statistical mechanics in the context of random fields. Formal definition For a continuous real-valued semimartingale (B_s)_{s\\\\ge 0}, the local time of B at the point x is the stochastic process which is informally defined by :L^x(t) =\\\\int_0^t \\\\delta(x-B_s)\\\\,d[B]_s, where \\\\delta is the Dirac delta function and [B] is the quadratic variation. It is a notion invented by Paul L√©vy. The basic idea is that L^x(t) is an (appropriately rescaled and time- parametrized) measure of how much time B_s has spent at x up to time t. More rigorously, it may be written as the almost sure limit : L^x(t) =\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\downarrow 0} \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\varepsilon} \\\\int_0^t 1_{\\\\\\\\{ x- \\\\varepsilon < B_s < x+\\\\varepsilon \\\\\\\\}} \\\\, d[B]_s, which may always be shown to exist. Note that in the special case of Brownian motion (or more generally a real-valued diffusion of the form dB = b(t,B)dt+ dW where W is a Brownian motion), the term d[B]_s simply reduces to ds, which explains why it is called the local time of B at x. For a discrete state-space process (X_s)_{s\\\\ge 0}, the local time can be expressed more simply as : L^x(t) =\\\\int_0^t 1_{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}}(X_s) \\\\, ds. Tanaka's formula Tanaka's formula also provides a definition of local time for an arbitrary continuous semimartingale (X_s)_{s\\\\ge 0} on \\\\mathbb R: : L^x(t) = X_t - x - X_0 - x - \\\\int_0^t \\\\left( 1_{(0,\\\\infty)}(X_s - x) - 1_{(-\\\\infty, 0]}(X_s-x) \\\\right) \\\\, dX_s, \\\\qquad t \\\\geq 0. A more general form was proven independently by Meyer and Wang; the formula extends It√¥'s lemma for twice differentiable functions to a more general class of functions. If F:\\\\mathbb R \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R is absolutely continuous with derivative F', which is of bounded variation, then : F(X_t) = F(X_0) + \\\\int_0^t F'_{-}(X_s) \\\\, dX_s + \\\\frac12 \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty L^x(t) \\\\, dF(x), where F'_{-} is the left derivative. If X is a Brownian motion, then for any \\\\alpha\\\\in(0,1/2) the field of local times L = (L^x(t))_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R, t \\\\geq 0} has a modification which is a.s. H√∂lder continuous in x with exponent \\\\alpha, uniformly for bounded x and t. In general, L has a modification that is a.s. continuous in t and c√†dl√†g in x. Tanaka's formula provides the explicit Doob‚ÄìMeyer decomposition for the one-dimensional reflecting Brownian motion, (B_s)_{s \\\\geq 0}. Ray‚ÄìKnight theorems The field of local times L_t = (L^x_t)_{x \\\\in E} associated to a stochastic process on a space E is a well studied topic in the area of random fields. Ray‚ÄìKnight type theorems relate the field Lt to an associated Gaussian process. In general Ray‚ÄìKnight type theorems of the first kind consider the field Lt at a hitting time of the underlying process, whilst theorems of the second kind are in terms of a stopping time at which the field of local times first exceeds a given value. =First Ray‚ÄìKnight theorem= Let (Bt)t ‚â• 0 be a one-dimensional Brownian motion started from B0 = a > 0, and (Wt)t‚â•0 be a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion W0 = 0 ‚àà R2. Define the stopping time at which B first hits the origin, T = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{t \\\\geq 0 \\\\colon B_t = 0\\\\\\\\}. Ray and Knight (independently) showed that {=} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ W_x^2 \\\\colon x \\\\in [0,a] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\,}} where (Lt)t ‚â• 0 is the field of local times of (Bt)t ‚â• 0, and equality is in distribution on C[0, a]. The process Wx2 is known as the squared Bessel process. =Second Ray‚ÄìKnight theorem= Let (Bt)t ‚â• 0 be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion B0 = 0 ‚àà R, and let (Lt)t ‚â• 0 be the associated field of local times. Let Ta be the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a > 0 : T_a = \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ t \\\\geq 0 \\\\colon L^0_t > a \\\\\\\\}. Let (Wt)t ‚â• 0 be an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion started from W0 = 0, then {=} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (W_x + \\\\sqrt a )^2 \\\\colon x \\\\geq 0 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. \\\\,}} Equivalently, the process (L^x_{T_a})_{x \\\\geq 0} (which is a process in the spatial variable x) is equal in distribution to the square of a 0-dimensional Bessel process, and as such is Markovian. =Generalized Ray‚ÄìKnight theorems= Results of Ray‚ÄìKnight type for more general stochastic processes have been intensively studied, and analogue statements of both () and () are known for strongly symmetric Markov processes.

These data centres are sometimes called the NERC designated Data Centres.  The Data Centres  The NERC Environmental Data Centres and their areas of responsibility are as follows: * British Oceanographic Data Centre - Marine Science * Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), joint responsibility with Science and Technology Facilities Council which include: ** British Atmospheric Data Centre - Atmospheric Science ** NERC Earth Observation Data Centre - Earth Observation ** UK Solar System Data Centre - Solar terrestrial physics (Earth Orientated) * Environmental Information Data Centre - Terrestrial & Freshwater Science, part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology * National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) - Earth Sciences - part of British Geological Survey * Polar Data Centre (UK PDC) - Polar Science - British Antarctic Survey The data centres hold data from environmental scientists working in the UK and around the world. They provide access to a comprehensive data and information resource about our environment, through the NERC Data Catalog Service. CEDA hosts the NERC Data Catalog Service, data may also be cataloged from certain NERC Data Centres and also at data.gov.uk. Access to these data is freely available to students, researchers and stakeholders, as well as business users and policy makers, to help them understand the environment in which we live. Each data centre works to build user confidence, using common data formats and noting sources, contexts, and degrees of accuracy. They combine expertise in the scientific collection of information, state-of-the-art data management and preservation techniques, making them an important national asset.  NERC Data Policy  The NERC Data Policy is commitment to support the long-term management of environmental data and also outlines the roles and responsibilities of all those involved in collecting and managing environmental data. The NERC Data Centres provide support and guidance in data management to those funded by NERC, are responsible for the long-term management of data and provide access to NERC's holdings of environmental data. The data policy is consistent with legal frameworks, such as the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, the INSPIRE Regulations 2009 and contractual arrangements with other bodies where, for example, NERC holds data on their behalf but does not own the intellectual property rights. To reflect NERC's continuing commitment to openness and transparency in the research process, and in support of the government's developing agenda on open access to public data, the NERC Data Policy has been substantially revised, and this new version of NERC's Data Policy came into force in January 2011. = Charging Policy = The NERC charging regime recognises two classes of data: # Raw or unrefined - these are data collected (or held) by NERC, with any necessary quality assurance or post processing applied, and used to deliver NERC's public function; # Value added or refined - these are data where an extra level of intellectual input has been added, for example, by combining a number of data sets together, or producing an information product by the interpretation of a number of data sets, and crucially, is above and beyond what is required to deliver NERC's public function. The licence charges that NERC can levy for the supply of data and information are governed by HM Treasury guidance and Government regulations. During 2010 NERC aimed to move to a position where it will supply its data for free for all teaching and research activities, apart from large or complex requests where they may make a nominal handling charge.  Science Information Strategy  The NERC Science Information Strategy (SIS) was created to provide the framework for NERC to work more closely and effectively with its scientific communities, both internal and external, in delivering data and information management services to support its five-year science strategy, the Next Generation Science for Planet Earth 2007-2012. The Science Information Strategy is being implemented in three phases, beginning April 2010. Each of these phases will be made up of a number of smaller projects. Project/Phase 1 will concentrate on determining user requirements, documenting existing holdings, agreeing an information architecture, updating the NERC Data Policy and improving the data discovery tools. The benefits of the SIS implementation for science include the increased competence of data centre staff to inform the science community, policy and decision makers nationally and internationally on best practice, standards development and the establishment of new projects and initiatives (e.g. EU Framework projects):enhancing NERC's national and international reputation and increased capability to conduct multi-disciplinary, integrated science.

In both wars the brigade was part of 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. History =Formation= The brigade was originally formed in 1908 in the Territorial Force (TF) as the South Western Brigade attached to the Wessex Division. It was composed of four TF infantry battalions, the 4th and 5th of the Prince Albert's (Somerset Light Infantry), the 4th Battalion of the Dorsetshire Regiment, and the 4th Battalion of the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment). =First World War= The division was mobilised in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Great War. The division was sent overseas to India to free up Regular Army troops for service on the Western Front in France and Belgium. In 1915 the division was numbered as the 43rd (Wessex) Division and the brigade became the 129th (1/1st South Western) Brigade. However, the division, and the brigade, never saw action and were disbanded later in the war but many of the division's units saw service with mainly British Indian Army brigades and divisions.

It was, however, reformed as the Territorial Army in 1920 and both the 43rd Division and the brigade were also reformed. The brigade was now known as 129th (South Western) Infantry Brigade, composed of the same battalions it had before the Great War and this was the composition of the brigade for most of the inter-war years. In 1938 all infantry brigades were reduced from four to three battalions and so, as a result, the 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment was transferred to the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade. In 1939 the brigade was redesignated as 129th Infantry Brigade and the 4th Dorsets was transferred to the 130th Infantry Brigade. In the same year, the 5th Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 4th Wilts when the Territorials were doubled in size, also joined the brigade and the 5th Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry was transferred to 135th Infantry Brigade, part of 45th (Wessex) Infantry Division, which was formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 43rd (Wessex).http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/43_Division__1930_38_.pdf =Second World War= The brigade served with the division throughout the Second World War and spent from 1939 until June 1944 in intensive training throughout the United Kingdom, particularly in Kent. They were training for the invasion of France and landed in Normandy in late June 1944. They fought in the Normandy Campaign, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the Rhine Crossing.

It has been introduced in Madagascar and India's Andaman Islands, where it is now a widespread invasive species.  Description  H. tigerinus from Bengaluru They are found in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. They are also found in the Maldives and Madagascar. They prefer freshwater wetlands and aquatic habitats. Generally they avoid coastal and forest areas. Rana tigrina is mostly solitary and nocturnal in nature. They inhabit holes and bushes near permanent water sources. The frog does not stay in water for a long time; it spends most of its time hiding and feeding in surrounding vegetation. They feed on various type of insects, invertebrates, mice, shrews, young frogs, earthworms, roundworms, juvenile snakes, and small birds. Vomerine teeth in two strong oblique series commence from the inner anterior angle of the choanae; lower jaw with two not very prominent bony processes in front. Head moderate; Snout more or less pointed; canthus rostralis obtuse; nostril a little nearer to the end of the mouth than to the eye; interorbital space narrower than the upper eyelid; tympanum distinct, about two thirds the size of the eye. Fingers rather short, first extending beyond second; toes moderate, obtuse, nearly entirely webbed ; a much developed membranaceous fringe along the fifth toe; sub-articular tubercles moderate; inner metatarsal tubercle very variable, small and blunt, or (var. ceylanica, Ceylon and S. India) nearly as long as the inner toe, strongly compressed, crescent shaped, shovel-shaped; no outer tubercle, a tarsal fold. Tibio-tarsal articulation reaching the ear, the eye, or a little beyond. Skin of back with longitudinal folds; a strong fold above the tympanum. Green or olive above, with dark spots; often a light vertebral line. Male with two subgular vocal sacs, conspicuous externally by folds of the skin on the sides of the throat; these regions generally blackish. It is semiaquatic, and is said, to jump over the surface of the water much in the same way as on land when frightened. This large frog can reach a snout to vent length of 170mm. This species is classified as Least Concern in the IUCN red list. Cultivation H.

Ryman was educated at Leighton Park School, Reading, and Pembroke College, Oxford.The Times Guide to the House of Commons (June 1983), page 54. Ryman was a barrister and a fox-hunter. He was elected MP for Blyth in the October 1974 general election, ousting the incumbent Eddie Milne (who had been re-elected as an Independent Labour MP at the February 1974 election after being deselected as the official Labour candidate). In 1976 Ryman's agent Peter Mortakis was fined ¬£400 in under the Representation of the People Act 1949 and the Perjury Act 1911 for falsifying his election expenses return and overspending, although the election result stood.Expenses issue for electoral law talks, The Times, 9 October 1976 In a close Parliament, Ryman's frequent absences from Parliament (either to continue his legal work or for other reasons) tried the patience of the whips. On one celebrated occasion the Chief Whip Bob Mellish went on the radio to ask listeners to get in touch if they had spotted him. When the German Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt urged the Labour Party to support British membership of the EEC, Ryman responded with \\"Why should this patronising Hun lecture the British Labour Party?\\"Phillip Whitehead, The Writing on the Wall, London: Michael Joseph, 1985, p. 135 Ryman held off a strong challenge from Milne in the 1979 general election, holding his seat with a majority of over 7,000.1979 General election results The constituency was renamed Blyth Valley for the 1983 general election, when the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) cut his majority to 3,243.1983 General election results In 1986, he announced that he was leaving the Labour Party and sat as an independent until he retired at the 1987 general election. His successor was Ronnie Campbell. On 23 April 1992 Ryman was convicted of defrauding two women of their life savings. He had pretended to be the director of a Swiss bank and told the women that they would get 22¬∑5% interest, but in fact paid the money to his ex-wife for maintenance payments. Ryman was given a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence. Personal life Ryman was a former husband of Shirley Summerskill, another Labour MP. They married in 1957 but had divorced by the time he entered Parliament.The New York Times Biographical Service, Volume 6, page 1614 He was married five times in all. He claimed to have invested some money belonging to his fifth wife Nicola, a wealthy widow, in a high-yield Swiss bank account but in fact squandered the money on a horse, Jaguar car and holidays on the Orient Express. He had previously narrowly escaped being prosecuted by the family of a mistress whose money he had also claimed to have invested in a Swiss account.

He is responsible for the early British television appearances of such acts as the Beatles, singer Cilla Black, comedian Woody Allen and singer Lisa Stansfield as Head of Light Entertainment with Granada Television. Biography =Early life and 1960s television= As a small boy he toured variety theatres as a stooge to his father, a magician known as the Great Hampo. In 1949 he won several talent contests with his own act, a Danny Kaye Tribute, and then toured with The Brian Michie Discoveries Show. In 1950 he was conscripted for two years service in the Royal Air Force. During the 1950s he trained as a Granada cinema manager in Kingston, moving to the group's flagship venue at Tooting to handle a 1953 Frank Sinatra concert. He presented many more, firstly with Johnnie Ray, Guy Mitchell and Frankie Laine, and later with Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard and Gene Vincent. In 1956 Hamp joined Granada's television division, retaining his responsibilities for stage show management, and booking acts for television productions such as Chelsea at Nine. Granada boss Sidney Bernstein soon noticed Hamp's potential as a producer, and put him in charge of several television quiz shows including Spot the Tune, Criss Cross Quiz and Take A Letter. By the later 1960s Hamp was based at the new company headquarters in Manchester, where he was making the regional news magazine programme Scene at 6.30. This was followed by a successful series of television specials featuring blues based American artists. The shows included Sarah Sings and Basie Swings (1963), with Sarah Vaughan and Count Basie; I Hear the Blues (1963), featuring Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson and Willie Dixon; The Blues and Gospel Train (1964), with Sister Rosetta Tharpe; Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On (1964), with Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent; and It's Little Richard (1963). In addition, he championed the Beatles by giving the band television exposure in 1962, at a time when they were little known outside Liverpool. Hamp made three notable television specials during 1965: Woody Allen, The Bacharach Sound and The Music of Lennon & McCartney. In 1969 he took over as producer of the film programme Cinema, fronted by the young Michael Parkinson. =The Comedians= 1971 saw Hamp's peak of success with the series The Comedians (intermittently 1971‚Äì1985), which introduced innumerable new faces to the British public and kickstarted a number of solo comedy careers. These included Mike Reid, Charlie Williams, Colin Crompton, Mick Miller, George Roper, Stan Boardman and Bernard Manning. The series featured mainly Northern stand-up comedians drawn from the club circuit. It was a ratings success for Granada. Continuing in the Northern club tradition, The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club (1974‚Äì1976), a variety series set in a makeshift working men's club, was another success, often featuring many cast members from The Comedians. Other notable programmes and series include The International PopProms (1975), Paul Daniels Blackpool Bonanza (1978), Bernard Manning in Las Vegas (1978) and The Video Entertainers (1981). =Retirement= Hamp left Granada Television in 1987, to form his own independent production company, Johnnie Hamp Enterprises. He became the subject of This Is Your Life in 1992, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Manchester's Victoria & Albert Hotel. In 2008, Hamp published his anecdotal autobiography It Beats Working For A Living. In December 2012, Hamp received 'The City of Manchester and Lord Mayor's Lifetime Achievement Award'. Now retired and still living in Manchester, Hamp concentrates on his love of oil painting, charity work and after-dinner speaking.

Biography Boulemia was a member of the Armed Islamic Group, an organisation fighting both the Algerian government and the Islamic Salvation Army and frequently targeting civilians, between the spring of 1995 and 1999. Abdelkader Hachani, a leading member of the Islamic Salvation Front, was assassinated on November 22, 1999, soon after being released from prison. In December the government announced that it had arrested Fouad Boulemia for his murder. Boulemia was sentenced to death on April 12, 2001 after a one-day trial. At the trial, he claimed to have been tortured by the secret services and threatened by General Toufik in person to force him to sign a confession that he now repudiated. This confession stated that, coincidentally finding himself in the dentist's waiting room with Hachani, he spontaneously decided to kill Hachani because Hachani was a leading figure of the Djaz'ara (Algerianisation) wing of the Islamic Salvation Front, and pulled out his weapon, shot Hachani, and ran away. In this trial, he was questioned neither by his lawyer, Ma√Ætre Khemis, nor by the prosecutor. Two witnesses reported seeing Boulemia shoot Hachani, although one was reported to have previously claimed to have seen a man named Abdelaoui, with a quite different physical appearance, shoot Hachani. He was sentenced to death again on August 1, 2004 for taking part in the Bentalha massacre, where more than 200 villagers were killed by armed guerrillas. He was released from Serkadji prison on March 10, 2006 (Libert√© 11 March 2006), shortly after the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation came into force.

She began piano lessons at the age of five, and made her debut at the age of ten. She studied at the National Conservatory in Warsaw, taking piano lessons from Zbigniew Drzewiecki (who founded the International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition) and composition lessons from the composer Karol Szymanowski. She later studied privately in Switzerland with J√≥zef Turczy≈Ñski, a noted Chopin interpreter and scholar. Personal life In 1938, she and her husband Markus Mizne moved first to Nice, then to Brazil to escape the growing anti-semitism in Europe. She became a Brazilian citizen, and for the rest of her life championed the music and composers of her adopted country. Her subsequent career saw her settling in Milan in 1962, then in 1973 in London. Musical career Blumental's repertoire was wide and adventurous, ranging from the Portuguese baroque to South American contemporary works. Her numerous recordings also included many forgotten concertos by composers such as Carl Czerny (Piano Concerto in A minor, Op.214), Ferdinand Ries (Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor, Op.55) and John Field. Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Piano Concerto No. 5 for her; she was soloist at the world premiere on 8 May 1955, at the Royal Festival Hall, London, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Jean Martinon,http://museuvillalobos.org.br/ingles/bancodad/VLSO_1.0.pdf and she also recorded the concerto in Paris, under the baton of the composer. Krzysztof Penderecki dedicated his Partita for harpsichord and orchestra to her. Her recording of this work won a Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy of France in 1975. Among her recordings was a boxed set of Beethoven's complete works for solo piano and orchestra, including two early works without opus number, as well as Beethoven's own arrangement for piano of his violin concerto. It is, however, her Chopin playing for which she will be most remembered. A pianist of considerable power, despite her diminutive size, her recordings of the Chopin mazurkas, in particular, are considered landmark interpretations. She died in 1991 in Israel, on one of her many concert tours of the country. She is buried in Tel Aviv's Kiryat Shaul Cemetery. Her daughter, the singer Annette C√©line, was one of the organizers of the annual Felicja Blumental International Music festival until her death on 3 June 2017. Many of Blumental's recordings have been restored on Brana Records, and all CD covers feature the art prints of her husband Markus Mizne.

He was the subject of a 1994 book by O'Kelley's great-great-niece.Ed O'Kelley: The Man Who Killed Jesse James' Murderer, by Judith Ries Over the years, historians and contemporary newspapers variously spelled O'Kelley's surname as \\"Kelly\\" or \\"O'Kelly\\", sometimes mistakenly using the letter \\"O\\" as his middle initial. Early years Little is known of O'Kelley's youth, although his birthplace is reported as Harrisonville, Missouri. His mother was Margaret Ann Capehart (6 July 1836 ‚Äì 27 July 1903), but at the time of her 14 July 1857 marriage to Dr. Thomas Katlett O'Kelley (20 October 1833 ‚Äì 9 October 1923) she was already pregnant with Edward. It is believed that Thomas was not Edward's father. Edward was a child during the American Civil War. In Thomas' Civil War Veteran Pension File, where Thomas was required to list all his children and their dates of birth, Edward is not included on the list.Thomas Katlett O'Kelley's Civil War Veteran Pension File  The Murder of Robert Ford  Robert Ford befriended outlaw Jesse James in 1882, when he and his brother Charley joined his gang. They lived with James and his family for a time. Ford shot James in the back of the head to collect a state bounty of $5 000. By 1892, he operated a tent saloon in the silver mining camp of Creede, Colorado. On 8 June 1892, while Ford was preparing to open his saloon, O‚ÄôKelley walked into the tent with a shotgun. Ford was turned away from the front entrance. O‚ÄôKelley called out, \\"Hello, Bob.\\". As Ford turned around to see who spoke, O‚ÄôKelley fired his shotgun, hitting Ford in the neck and killing him instantly. O‚ÄôKelley never explained why he had shot Ford. One theory involves the accusation that O‚ÄôKelley had stolen Ford‚Äôs diamond ring, and the dispute had escalated. O‚ÄôKelley was initially imprisoned for life, though his sentence was later reduced to 18 years. In the end, O‚ÄôKelley served only around 9 years at the Colorado State Penitentiary before being released due, firstly, to a 7 000-signature petition in favour of his release, and, secondly, to a medical condition. After incarceration After his release, O'Kelley moved to Oklahoma City. Shortly after his arrival in town, he was recognized by Otto Ewing of the Southern Club, a local gambling house. It is claimed that Ewing had been connected with Ford's saloon in Creede, and may even have been there when O'Kelley killed Ford. Ewing told people that O'Kelley was a dangerous man and best avoided. In December 1903, police officer Joe Burnett arrested O'Kelley as a \\"suspicious character\\". O'Kelley was staying at the Lewis Hotel. He frequented the saloons on West 4th and 2nd Streets, which were known as the hangouts of criminals in the early years of the city. Personal life Nicknamed \\"Red\\", O'Kelley married a relative of the Younger brothers. Death Edward O'Kelley's gravestone On 13 January 1904, O'Kelley was arrested by a police officer named Bunker. O'Kelley was released and went to his hotel, where he commented to others that the police had better not try to arrest him again. That evening, Officer Joseph Grant \\"Joe\\" Burnett (1867-1917) was walking his beat on the south side of First Street, in front of the McCord & Collins building. Burnett encountered O'Kelley and greeted him politely. In reply, O'Kelley struck at the lawman and drew a revolver. As O'Kelley struck at the officer again, Burnett grabbed the gun with his left hand. The two men began to wrestle in a life-and-death struggle. O'Kelley fired his pistol several times, trying to shoot the policeman. At the same time, O'Kelley repeatedly called Burnett foul names, saying he was going to kill him. Burnett called out for help repeatedly. O'Kelley did not hit Burnett with his gunfire, but Burnett did receive powder burns on one ear. Once out of ammunition, O'Kelley used his teeth to bite chunks out of both of the policeman's ears. A friend of O'Kelley came to his aid and fired one shot at the policeman, but then lost his nerve and ran away. R. E. Chapin witnessed the fight from the rear of the building on West Main Street and telephoned police headquarters. Finally, A. G. Paul, a railroad baggage man, came running from the depot. He grabbed O'Kelley's hand, thus freeing Burnett's gun hand. The policeman immediately fired two shots and killed O'Kelley. There were two bullet holes in the back of Burnett's overcoat, and the left hip pocket was torn by a bullet. By the time friends reached his side, Burnett's gloves were burned and his clothing was on fire. They called an ambulance to take O'Kelley's body to the morgue at Street and Harpers furniture store. His body had a bullet wound in his left leg just above the knee. The fatal shot entered his head just behind the left temple and exited behind the right ear. O'Kelley's body remained at the morgue for about two weeks. A number of people, including Otto Ewing, identified the dead man as the killer of Robert Ford. The warden of the Colorado State Penitentiary, where O'Kelley had been imprisoned, sent city authorities a description and photograph of O'Kelley, leaving no doubt of his identification. On 28 January 1904, O'Kelley was interred at Fairlawn Cemetery in north Oklahoma City. The county provided the casket and service, at a cost to the taxpayers of $12.50. Burnett continued with the Oklahoma City Police Department, serving as a Captain and later as assistant Chief of Police. He died on 20 July 1917 of paralysis after a stroke, at St. Anthony's Hospital. Burnett was buried in a marked grave in the same cemetery as the man he killed. Memorial O'Kelley Memorial - Front O'Kelley Memorial - Back A memorial for Edward O'Kelley stands in the Patton United Methodist Church cemetery, on Country Road 878, in Patton, Missouri. The monument is engraved on both sides. The front of the monument reads: ::Edward Capehart O'Kelley ::1858 - January 13, 1904 :Shot and killed Robert N. Ford, :the murderer of Jesse James, in the :Silver mining camp at Creede, :Colorado. O'Kelley died in the :streets of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma :in a gunfight with the law. The back of the memorial contains engraved scenes from 1890s Creede Colorado, where O'Kelley fatally shot Ford. The monument was erected through the efforts of Judith Ries, O'Kelley's great-great niece.

It runs east-west from Ebertstra√üe to Wilhelmstra√üe in the borough of Mitte, one street north of Leipziger Stra√üe and very close to Potsdamer Platz. It is best known for being the location of Hitler's new Reich Chancellery complex, and the bunker where he spent his last days. History In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area was the site of several mansions owned by members of the Prussian aristocracy, some of which were taken over by government departments. One of these was the home of Ferdinand August Hans Friedrich von Vo√ü-Buch (1788‚Äì1871), a Prussian military officer who was at one time commander of the \\"Garde-Grenadier-Regiment Kaiser Alexander von Russland\\" which was stationed in Berlin, and who retired with the rank of General in 1854 and became a Count in 1864. His home was the \\"Marschall Palais\\" in Wilhelmstra√üe (sometimes referred to as \\"Palais Vo√ü\\" or the \\"Vo√üsche Palais\\"), built in 1736 by architect Philipp Gerlach (1679-1748) and demolished in 1872, the year after Vo√ü-Buch's death, to allow the creation of the street which was to bear his name. (Another street under the same name in Berlin's district Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg was named after Johann Heinrich Voss).So spelt in English. He has articles, with this spelling, both in the 1911 Britannica, and in the present online edition. Palais Borsig, about 1881 Among the notable buildings in the Vo√üstrasse in the mid-1930s were: on the north side, numbered from east to west; Vo√üstra√üe 1 - the Borsig Palais, on the corner of Wilhelmstra√üe, built in 1875-1877 on part of the site of the former Marshall Palais, for the German businessman and manufacturer Albert Borsig (1829‚Äì1878), son of locomotive engineer August Borsig, although he never actually moved into it and died a year after its completion; 2 - the head office of Mitropa, a catering company which from 1916 until 2002 managed sleeping and dining cars throughout the German rail system; 3 - the Embassy of Bavaria; 4-5 - the Justice Ministry of the German Empire, Weimar Republic and Third Reich; 6 - the head office of the German Reich Railway Co; 10 - the Embassy of W√ºrttemberg; 11 - the Nazi Party's Berlin offices; 15 - the Bank of Delbr√ºck Schickler & Co; 19 - the Embassy of Saxony. On the south side, numbered from west to east; Vo√üstra√üe 20 - the former Reich Naval Office, which had relocated to the Bendlerblock in 1914; 22 - the Mosse Palais, home of the German Jewish publishing tycoon Hans Lachmann-Mosse (1885‚Äì1944); 24-32 - the rear of the enormous Jewish-owned department store Wertheim; 33-35 - more offices of the German Reich Railway Co. By the 1930s the latter had been taken over by the new Reich Ministry of Transport, which in its final form occupied an extensive range of buildings with facades in three streets (Vo√üstrasse, Leipziger Stra√üe and Wilhelmstra√üe). Other addresses in Vo√üstrasse were mostly residential properties. New Reich Chancellery, 1939 In 1938 the entire north side of the street, except for the Borsig Palais (Vo√üstra√üe 1), was demolished to make way for the new Reich Chancellery building, built by Albert Speer for Adolf Hitler and opened in January 1939. Incorporating the Borsig Palais within its structure, the Chancellery extended back along the whole length of the Vo√üstrasse, a distance of 430 metres: its official address was Vo√üstra√üe 6. The building was severely damaged by Allied bombs in February 1945, and the ruins later demolished by the Soviet occupying forces. Hitler killed himself in the F√ºhrerbunker, a little further north, on 30 April 1945. From 7 October 1949, Vo√üstrasse was located in East Berlin, which did little to develop the Potsdamer Platz area as it was in the sensitive border zone, along which the Berlin Wall would eventually divide the city. By 1956 there was only one surviving building in the entire length of Vo√üstrasse - part of the German Reich Railway Co. offices (Vo√üstrasse 33). When the Berlin Wall went up in August 1961, much of Vo√üstra√üe became stranded in no-man's-land. Today, there is still little of note along the street, although it continues to attract curious visitors looking for the site of the Reich Chancellery and the F√ºhrerbunker. Vo√üstrasse from the air in December 2003 In the aerial photograph on the right, taken in December 2003, Vo√üstrasse runs from top to bottom just to the right of centre. The Reich Chancellery ran the full length of the north (left) side, up to Wilhelmstra√üe, the street running from left to right at the top of the picture. Today there are several GDR-era apartment blocks, built between 1986 and 1990, and some fenced-off waste land behind the apartment blocks along Wilhelmstra√üe. On the south (right) side of Vo√üstrasse, the sole-surviving pre-war building, part of the German Reich Railway Co. offices (Vo√üstra√üe 33), can be seen, mostly surrounded by the empty sites of the Wertheim department store and the rest of the Transport Ministry. Note also the concrete \\"lid\\" over the U-Bahn line. Legacy Some of the stones from the new Reich Chancellery on Vo√üstrasse were later used for the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin-Treptow.

A tenacious, and physically strong winger, he also possessed notable stamina, a powerful shot from distance, and was accurate from set- pieces. Club career Born in Venaria Reale, Province of Turin, Fuser started his professional career with Torino in 1986. He played 49 games for them before moving to A.C. Milan (1989‚Äì92). During his two seasons at Milan he collected a UEFA Champions League (1989) medal and a Scudetto (1988), as well as the 1989 European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup titles. During his time at Milan, Fuser also spent time on loan at Fiorentina during the 1990‚Äì91 season, before completing a move to Lazio in 1992. This turned out to be arguably his most successful time in football becoming a fan favourite while playing 188 games in six years, scoring 35 goals and winning the Coppa Italia and reaching the UEFA Cup Final in 1998, as the club's captain. After moving to Parma in 1998 he won the UEFA Cup, the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup in 1999. He wore the number 14 shirt and captained the team in their 3‚Äì0 1999 UEFA Cup Final victory over Olympique Marseille on 6 May. Fuser blotted his Lazio copybook by joining A.S. Roma in the summer of 2001, where he only played 15 games in two seasons, winning the 2001 Supercoppa Italiana, and managing second-place finishes in Serie A in 2002, and in the Coppa Italia in 2003. During the 2003‚Äì04 season he played for his original club Torino, in Serie B. =In the lower leagues= In 2004, he signed for A.S.D.C. Canelli, whom he helped to win its Eccellenza round during the 2005‚Äì06 season, earning promotion to Serie D. In 2008, together with fellow player and personal friend Gianluigi Lentini, he moved to Saviglianese, a Promozione amateur club of Piedmont. He played also for the amateur clubs of Canelli and Nicese, which he simultaneously coached. In 2012, he played for another amateur club of Piedmont, Colline Alfieri Don Bosco in Promozione. International career Fuser initially represented Italy at Under-21 level on 18 occasions between 1987 and 1990, scoring 2 goals; he was notably a member of the team that finished in third place at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, under manager Cesare Maldini. He also played for the senior Italy national football team on 25 occasions between 1993-2000, scoring 3 goals, and he was a participant at the 1996 UEFA European Championship under manager Arrigo Sacchi, making 3 appearances as Italy were eliminated in the first found. He was also in Dino Zoff's provisional 26 man squad for UEFA Euro 2000 before missing the final cut. Personal life Diego Fuser is married to Orietta. Their son Matteo died in 2011, at the age of 15, after struggling with illness.

It got its name from its founders, Arthur Grice, J Talfourd Wood and C.M. Keiller. The cars were unusual in using a friction drive system. The prototype was made in a stable in Beckenham, Kent, and used a Coventry-Simplex engine, rear-mounted. The drive system involved the engine, which was mounted across the chassis, turning a disc on which a wheel could be moved from the periphery to the centre. Top speed was with the driven wheel furthest from the centre and reverse was obtained by moving it past the centre. A few examples were sold before the company moved to Datchet, Buckinghamshire in 1912. Proper production now started still using a water- cooled, Coventry-Simplex twin-cylinder engine of 1045 cc and 1069 two-seat cars were made before the outbreak of World War 1 and a move to war work. A move was also made to the larger Cordwallis Works in Maidenhead in 1914. During the war the company was run by Grice as his partners were in the army. Grice left the company in 1920 to start the unsuccessful Unit car company leaving Wood and Keiller in charge. They re-introduced the pre-war model, now called the Type E, and a further 82 were made largely from left over parts. A new model, the Type F was introduced in 1919 and was front-engined with a 1368 cc four-cylinder engine, still by Coventry-Simplex, with shaft drive to the friction disc at the rear. It was not a good seller partly because of the noise from the transmission. The Type H overcame most of the drive line problems but suffered from the reputation of its predecessor. About 1700 of the Types F and H were made between 1919 and 1926. The company had not given up on the rear-engined idea and a new car, the Type J, appeared in 1922 but only a few were sold. It had a bonnet and radiator very similar to the front- engined cars. The final car, the type G of 1930 was also rear-engined, with the engine behind the rear axle, only a few were made. GWK's greatest days were before World War 1 and after 1918 financial success eluded them. They went into temporary liquidation in 1922 and Wood and Keiller left but Grice returned in 1923. No cars seem to have been made between 1926 and 1930 and very few of the Type G were produced. The company finally closed in 1931 with the Cordwallis factory being used by Streamline Cars Ltd and later Marendaz. GWK also sold an imported Belgian Imperia car between 1924 and 1928 as the British Imperia. There were plans to build the Imperia at Maidenhead but these came to nothing.

The lake and surrounding area are protected as the Tso Moriri Wetland Conservation Reserve. The lake is at an altitude of . It is the largest of the high altitude lakes entirely within India and entirely within Ladakh in this Trans-Himalayan biogeographic region. It is about 16 miles (26 km) north to south in length and two to three miles (3 to 5 km) wide. The lake has no outlet at present and the water is brackish though not very perceptible to taste. The lake is fed by springs and snow-melt from the adjacent mountains. Most water enters the lake in two major stream systems, one entering the lake from the north, the other from the southwest. Both stream systems include extensive marshes where they enter the lake. It formerly had an outlet to the south, but this has become blocked and the lake has become an endorheic lake. The lake is oligotrophic in nature, and its waters are alkaline. Accessibility to the lake is largely limited to summer season, though Karzok on the northwest shore and the military facilities on the eastern shores have year- round habitation. Tso Moriri Topography As per a classification of the Himalayan Lakes done on the basis of their origin, there are four groups and Tso Moriri falls under the third group of \\"remnant lakes\\". The classification as reported states:http://planningcommission.nic.in/aboutus/committee/wrkgrp11/tf11_ecosys.pdf Report of the Task Force On the Mountain Ecosystems, Environment and Forest Sector, for Eleventh Five Year Plan 2007-2012 (From web archive) > (i) Glacial lakes which are formed in and around glaciers; (ii) Structural > lakes, formed by folds or faults due to movements in earth‚Äôs crust (e.g. > Nainital lake in Uttarakhand), (iii) Remnant lakes which were originally > structural but represent the remnants of vast lakes (e.g., Tso Moriri, Tso > Kar, Pangong Tso in Ladakh, and Dal Lake in Kashmir), (iv) Natural dammed > lakes i.e., temporary water bodies formed along the river courses due to > deposition of rocks or debris e.g. Gohna Tal in Garhwal, Uttarakhand. The Changthang Plateau in the eastern Ladakh represents a landscape of low productive ecosystems which protects unique floral and faunal species. The area is an extension of the western Tibetan plateau that lies above msl and supports diverse but low populations of several globally threatened mammals. The lake's basin could also be categorised as an basin since it is a closed drainage basin that retains water and allows no outflow to other bodies of water such as rivers or oceans. Tso Moriri, Korzok, in Ladakh. The lake is 20 to 50 kilometers southeast of the elevated valley of the core Rupshu Valley and falls within the greater Rupshu Plateau and valley area. The lake is ringed by hills rising over . \\"Changpas\\", the nomadic migratory shepherds (pastoral community) of yak, sheep, goat, and horses of Tibetan origin and who are engaged in trade and work on caravans in Ladakh region, are the main inhabitants of the area.http://www.lehladakh.net/tsomoriri- ladakh.htm.Tsomoriri lake treckshttp://www.eastmanvoyages.com/tour- options/rumtse-tsomoriri.html Rumtse - Tso Moriri Trek Changpa (Champa) herders use the land of this valley as grazing ground and for cultivation. The Working Report (2006) of the Planning Commission of the Government of India also reports: > Despite a poor vegetation cover, relatively low standing biomass and high > anthropogenic pressure, this area sustains a considerably high livestock > population. Steady increase in the livestock population in the area is > mainly attributed to influx of nomadic herders from Tibet during recent > decades and promotion of Pashmina goat production by the Animal Husbandry > Department (AHD) for fine quality under wool (Pashmina). The herders and AHD > officials, in recent years have begun to raise concern over degradation of > pastures, resultant shortage of forage, and mass mortality of livestock > during severe winters. The Korzok Monastery, on the western bank of the lake is 400 years old and attracts tourists and Buddhist pilgrims. Tourism during May ‚Äì September attracts large number of foreign and local tourists even though tented accommodation is the facility available, apart from a small PWD guest house close to the Lake. Northeast of Tso Moriri is a small lake which is known locally as Lake of Joy.  Access  The lake is located to the southeast of Leh in eastern Ladakh, ladakh, at a road distance of . The road is in a good condition for the most part. One can also reach Tsomoriri directly from the Pangong Tso via the remote Changtang region. This is considered to be one of the most beautiful drives in the entire Ladakh region. Foreigners are not allowed to go beyond the Man - Merak villages on Pangong Tso as permits are not issued for them. The distance between Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri is 235 km and there are no petrol pumps in the area. Carrying enough fuel is therefore necessary. Leh is also connected by air with many destinations in India.  Hydrology and water quality  The lake, with water spread area of is enclosed by peaks exceeding 6,000 meters on both the east and west sides. On the south, a nearly flat valley connects with but does not drain into or out of the Pare Chu river which is part of Sutlej river basin. Lingdi Nadi, major tributary of Tso Moriri, drains western catchment area of the lake and joins the lake on its south side. This valley contains the Nuro Sumdo wetlands (with a catchment area of ), a boggy area that mostly drains into the Pare Chu. Several small mountain streams feed the lake, including one through pasture land at Peldo Le. The lake is fed by springs and snow melt and has a maximum depth of . Aridity and cold desert conditions prevail in the lake region; with summer temperature varying from 0¬∞ to 30 ¬∞C (32¬∞ to 86 ¬∞F) and winter temperature recording ‚àí10¬∞ and ‚àí40 ¬∞C (14¬∞ to -40 ¬∞F). Geologically the lake is in Ordovician rock.. The brackish water of the lake has NaC1 less than 5.85 g/L, measured in mid-summer. Fauna and flora Kiangs in the vicinity of Tso Moriri Lake An avifaunal survey of the lake and its adjoining Nuro Sumdo wetland conducted in July 1996 revealed the following facts: =Avifauna= * Thirty-four species of birds included 14 species of water birds (some are pictured in the gallery) of which following are the vulnerable species ** Black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) endangered. ** Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus)‚Äì only breeding ground in India ** Brown-headed gulls (Larus brunnicephalus) ** Great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) ** Ferruginous pochard ** Black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) = Mammals = * Tibetan gazelle, Procapra picticaudata, Goa antelope (threatened) * Lynx * Nayan Ovis ammon hodgsoni * Bharal (Pseudois nayaur) Himalayan blue sheep * Tibetan Ass (Kiang) or Equus kiang, endemic to the Tibetan Plateau * Great Tibetan Sheep * One species of marmot, Marmota himalayana in large numbers seen on the hill slopes surrounding the lake and also along the roadsides * One species of hare, Lepus oistolus * One species of vole, Alticola roylei * Three species of mouse hares, Ochotona macrotis, Ochotona curzoniae or Tibetan sand fox and Scincella ladacensis =Large carnivores= * Carnivores fauna reported are: ** the snow leopard (Uncia uncia) ** the Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus chanco) Tso Moriri Lake during August = Vegetation = While the deeper parts of the lake have no vegetation, the shallow areas are reported to have Potamogeton sps. Marshes have several species of sedges and reeds, particularly Carex, Caragana and Astragalus sps., which are all representative of the surrounding arid steppe vegetation. Details of the Vegetation recorded in the area comprises the following: * Characteristic Caragana and Astragalus species * Potamogeton species * Several species of Carex, Primula (low growing herb), and Pedicularis(parasitic plant) * Common species of Juncus thomsonii and Leontopodium sp * Phytoplankton species of Oocystis with density was 900 cells/L to a depth of . Specimens of the diatom Cyclotella also recorded. * Pastures for domestic livestock = Ramsar site = Largely based on the ecological diversity of the Lake (explained in the previous section) and its surroundings, the Tsomiriri was notified in November 2002 under the List of Ramsar Wetland sites under the Ramsar Convention. The justification could be summarized as: * The faunal collection is unique and has a large variety with endemic and vulnerable species * The herbivore species are also endemic to the region * The lake plays a fundamental role as breeding grounds and key staging posts on migration routes for several water birds belonging to six families, which is distinctive of wetland diversity and productivity  Threats to the lake  Jammu and Kashmir, India There are a number of threats to the Lake, such as: * Increase in the number of tourists visiting the lake affecting the breeding of avifauna * Additional road construction along the lake * Pasture degradation affecting wildlife, particularly wild herbivores (marmots, hares, ungulates) * An increase in the grazing of sheep in the wetlands surrounding the lake * The absence of a proper garbage disposal facility at the lake. * Dogs kept by the people who live near the lake are known to attack the cranes and destroy their eggs. * Jeep safaris have been known to chase wildlife such as kiang and approach close to the breeding ground. * Lack of regulations and monitoring by the government. Conservation efforts The need for evolving a strategy and an action plan to preserve the extreme fragility of the lake ecosystem has been recognized with the needed emphasis at the National and International level to develop the lake conservation activity with participation of all stakeholders. Conservation of High Altitude Wetlands in Ladakh The actions initiated in this direction are: Tso Moriri is an administratively declared Wetland Reserve. Legally, shooting wildlife is prohibited. The State Department of Wildlife has set up a check post near Mahe Bridge at the entrance towards the lake. WWF-India Project has established a field office at Korzok on the northwest shore of Tso Moriri for ‚ÄòConservation of High Altitude Wetlands in Ladakh Region‚Äô to carry out surveys, interact with tourists, tour guides, act as information centre and conduct education awareness programmes for locals, tourists etc. Wildlife Institute of India has also set up a field station at Leh to carry out scientific research in the region. Nature clubs have been set up and Information booklet on the lake published. Efforts of WWF ‚Äì India has also resulted in the local community declaring Tso Moriri as a ‚ÄòSacred Gift for a Living Planet‚Äô during the Annual Conference held in Nepal in November 2000. Some of the other achievements so far reported on the Lake's conservation are: * Regulation in consultation with local community Vehicular traffic flow and parking has been restructured with restriction of camping sites around the lake * The Indo Tibetan Border Patrol (ITBP), tour operators and local population have introduced regular garbage cleanup operations * Korzok community living around the lake has voluntarily built traditional and social fencing around the wetland to protect breeding and feeding grounds from vehicular traffic * Tso Moriri Conservation Trust has been set up. * Twenty Nature Clubs have been registered in different schools in Ladakh The Indian Army has committed to support and set up a Nature Interpretation Centre at 'Hall of Fame', Leh.  World Wildlife Fund‚Äôs (WWF) role  World Wildlife Fund for Nature -- India (WWF-India) is spearheading the efforts at conservation of the Tso Moriri lake in particular, and the Ladakh region in general. WWF's activities as a NGO have spanned more than 30 years. The main objective set by WWF ishttp://www.reachladakh.com/Non_Governmental_Organisations.htm Non Governmental Organisations the main activities planned for the Tso Moriri and other wetlands in Ladakh regions are: > The Promotion of Nature Conservation and Environmental Protection as the > Basis for Sustainable and Equitable Development. * Evolve plan to establish a Sustainable Tourism Model managed by Local Communities at Tso Moriri * Carry on with the biological and socio-economic surveys around selected wetlands and document for future reference * Organize capacity building training programmes for Tour operators, Army, Teachers and local communities * Frequent education and awareness Programmes for various target groups * Management Planning for Tso Moriri and also Tsokar and Pangong Tso lakes by involving major stakeholders * To set guidelines for introducing Eco-Tourism Certification Scheme in Ladakh * To mobilise financial resources to carry out a comprehensive Strategic Environment Assessment * Develop Environmental Management Systems, implement and certify the Environment Management Systems with special focus on tourism sector * Maintain and enhance existing field presence at Tso Moriri, Leh, and Tsokar and increase presence at Chushul and Hanle marshes as well to achieve better results See also * Leh * Ladakh * Karzok * Soda lake References  External links  * Tso Moriri Travel Guide * Himalayan Jeep Safari : Manali - Tso-Morari - Leh * Government of Jammu & Kashmir, Department of Wildlife Protection, Wildlife Division (LAHDC), Leh Ladakh (Undated): Tso Moriri Wetland Conservation Reserve (The Wildlife Guide) * Rizvi, J.

It is held today in the university library of Kassel, Germany (Ms. 4¬∞ theol. 24). It contains several parts, among them an Exhortatio ad plebem christianam, an instructional theological text in Latin. The part that has been of most interest for modern scholarship is that of the so-called Kassel glosses, one of the earliest written documents of the Old High German language. The Kassel glosses are a collection of words and short phrases translated from Latin to Old High German. They appear to have been meant as a practical tool to help speakers of Romance languages to learn Old High German. Among them are everyday phrases such as orders given to servants (\\"shave my beard\\"), questions and answers for basic communication (\\"do you understand? No, I don't\\"), and a few fragmentary grammar paradigms (\\"I understand, you understood, we understood\\"). The most famous entry, however, is a jocular jibe in Latin and Old High German: *Latin: \\"Stulti sunt romani sapienti sunt paioari modica est sapientia in romana plus habent stultitia quam sapientia.\\" *Old High German: \\"Tole sint uualha, spahe sint peigira; luzic ist spahe in uualhum mera hapent tolaheiti denne spahi.\\" *Translation: \\"Roman (\\"uualha\\") people are stupid, Bavarians are smart; there is little smartness in the Romans; they have more stupidity than smartness.\\" The manuscript is written on 60 sheets of parchment. Based on the scribal hands and the forms of the Carolingian minuscule employed, it is believed that the text was written by two different scribes from the area of Regensburg c. 810\\\\. Parts of the text have a parallel in a second manuscript held in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The manuscript came to Kassel from Fulda in 1632. It was mentioned for the first time by Johann Heinrich Hottinger in his work Historica ecclesiastica novi testamenti from 1637. The first scholarly study of the manuscript was done by Wilhelm Grimm in 1846. Grimm made the mistake of re-drawing the text with a modern ink to make the writing more legible. This has caused some permanent damage to the fragile material. See also * University of Kassel References * Wilhelm Braune und Ernst A.

Early life Bryan was born in Karuizawa, Japan, the seventh of nine children of The Rev Ingram Bryan. He lived in Japan until he was eight and then returned to England and was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead. He studied Modern Languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took great interest in sport, playing cricket and rugby ‚Äì he was scrum half in the college rugby team where he played alongside his friend Iain Macleod, the future Conservative Chancellor. After graduating he worked in Halifax, Yorkshire, where he met his first wife Betty Hoyle. They married in 1939. Military career Paul Bryan had a distinguished wartime career. He served with the Royal West Kent Regiment during World War II. He entered as a private soldier and attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel gaining the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In 1942 he fought first in North Africa as part of the Torch Landings. He was given command of 6th Battalion for the invasion of Sicily and then Italy in September 1943. For his \\"outstanding\\" leadership shown in the capture of Centuripe, Bronte and Monte Rivoglia in Sicily, he was awarded a DSO. After leading his battalion at Monte Cassino, he finished the war as commandant of a training unit established at Barmouth, Wales. Here he brought his wartime colleagues Denis Forman and Fred Majdelaney as instructors. Political career After the war he worked in Sowerby Bridge where he started to take an interest in politics. He contested Sowerby in 1949, 1950 and 1951. In 1955 he became Member of Parliament for Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and later for Boothferry from 1983 until he retired in 1987. In 1956, Edward Heath, then Chief Whip, invited him to become a whip. He was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party 1961‚Äì65, a whip 1956 and 1958‚Äì61, and Minister for Employment from 1970 to 1972. Bryan was one of the first Tory MPs after the Labour victories of 1974 to suggest openly that it was time for Edward Heath to resign. In the leadership contest of 1975, he served on William Whitelaw's campaign committee. He was captain of the Parliamentary Golf Society and vice- chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee from 1977 to 1987. Through his wartime friend Denis Forman he became involved in Granada Television where Sidney Bernstein invited him to join the board. He assembled the consortium which gained the licence for Piccadilly Radio in Manchester. He was chairman of Croydon Cable Television from 1985. Having been brought up in The Far East he took a great interest in Japan and China. He was chairman of the All-Party Hong Kong Parliamentary Group from 1974 to 1987. He made many friends among political leaders and businessmen both in the colony and in mainland China. He took Chris Patten on his first visit to Hong Kong and later took great interest in the negotiations for the transfer of the colony to China. He took a practical approach to the negotiations. He had immense sympathy for the people of Hong Kong but believed that a handover to China was unavoidable; at the same time, he remained optimistic about the prospects for the colony under Chinese rule. Personal life He had three daughters: Dr Elizabeth Bryan, a paediatrian; Felicity Bryan, a literary agent and writer; and Bernadette Hingley who was one of the first women priests in the Church of England. In 1971 he married Cynthia Duncan, daughter of Sir Patrick Ashley Cooper and the widow of Patrick Duncan and gained four stepchildren: Patrick, Alex, Ann and Emma Duncan. He had a passion for golf which he learned from his first father-in-law James Hoyle. He played regularly at Ganton Golf Course until his last years. He was President of Ganton Golf Club. While he never considered himself a good golfer, he gained fame in 1962 by hitting two holes- in-one in one round.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Soissons, Laon, and Saint-Quentin. The construction of the south transept was begun about 1177, and the lowest courses of the choir in 1182. History The choir, with its original three-storey elevation and extremely tall clerestory, was completed in 1211. This was earlier than Chartres, on which the design was supposed to have been based. Work then continued into the nave until the late 13th century.John James, The Template-makers of the Paris Basin, Leura, 1989. The single western tower dates from the mid-13th century and is an imitation of those of Notre-Dame de Paris, which it equals in height (66 m, or 216 ft). The tower was restored after it and part of the nave were severely damaged in World War I. A matching tower on the other side of the fa√ßade was originally planned, but never built. Description The graceful southern transept, the oldest portion of the whole edifice, terminates in an apse. Unlike the rest of the building, it is divided inside into four (rather than three) levels. The choir end of the cathedral has stained glass from the 13th century. A tapestry from the 15th century depicts the life of the martyrs Gervasius and Protasius, the patron saints of the cathedral. Rubens' Adoration of the Shepherds hangs in the northern transept, as does a painting by Philippe de Champaigne. Maurice Durufl√© composed his work for organ \\"Fugue sur de la Cath√©drale de Soissons\\" op. 12 (1962) Some of the stained glass windows from the Cathedrale de Soissons are on permanent exhibit at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, MA.  2017 Storm Damage  On January 12, 2017, during a winter storm, strong winds pushed in a significant portion of the west rose window. Large stone pieces of the window's tracery and sections of stained glass fell onto the tracker-action pipe organ located below the rose window, causing severe damage to the instrument.

Background Butler was born in Halstead, the second of four children of Rab Butler and his wife, Sydney, only child of Samuel Courtauld. He was educated at Maidwell Hall prep school in Northamptonshire and Eton College. Career After National Service from 1949 to 1951 as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, he read history and economics at Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1951 to 1954 (where his grandfather, Sir Montagu Butler, had been Master). After graduating, he joined the Canadian Army for as a captain to serve as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Canada, Vincent Massey, for one year. His mother died of cancer in 1954, while he was in Canada. He returned to England in 1955, and he joined the family company, Courtaulds, working as a director of various subsidiaries. Butler became Member of Parliament for Bosworth in 1970, surprisingly defeating the sitting Labour Party MP, Woodrow Wyatt. He was first Conservative MP to represent the seat since the 1920s, and barely retained his seat at the two general elections in 1974. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Joseph Godber, who was Minister of State in the Foreign Office and then at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He became a whip in 1974. After Margaret Thatcher became Conservative leader in 1975, Butler became one of her two Parliamentary Private Secretaries, along with John Stanley. After the Conservative victory at the 1979 general election, he served as Minister of State for Industry at the Department of Industry until 1981, and then as minister for economic development in Northern Ireland until 1984, where he called in the receivers at the De Lorean motorcar company, and finally as minister for defense procurement until 1985. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1984, and knighted in 1986. He was also a member of the Court of the Goldsmiths' Company and later chairman of the British Hallmarking Council from 1998 to 2004; chairman of the Samuel Courtauld Trustees, associated with the Courtauld Institute of Art, from 1989 to 2005; and chairman of the Airey Neave Trust from 1990 to 2000. Personal life and family He lived at his farm at Lighthorne in Warwickshire. He became a Deputy Lieutenant of Warwickshire in 1993, and served as Vice Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire from 1998 to 2005. He enjoyed field sports, and was chairman of the Warwickshire Hunt for 23 years. He also was member of the Countryside Animal Welfare Group, and campaigned to end the RSPCA's support for a hunting ban as a member of its council. He married Felicity Molesworth-St Aubin in 1955. He died in Lighthorne, Warwickshire, survived by his wife and their two sons and daughter.

He joined the Hudson's Bay Company in Scotland as a clerk and came to Lower Canada in 1820. He worked in the fur trade in the Ottawa River and Timiskaming districts. He later purchased farm land near Renfrew on the Bonnechere River. In 1840, he retired from the Hudson's Bay Company, settled in Renfrew and opened a general store there. McDougall also built the first gristmill at Renfrew. He served on the council for the Bathurst District and on the township council for Renfrew, including several terms as reeve. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1857 but resigned in 1858 to provide a seat in the assembly for William Cayley, who had been named to the Executive Council. Shortly afterwards, he was named coroner for the United Counties of Lanark and Renfrew. He died in Renfrew, Canada West in 1860 after an extended illness.

They are used in high resolution schemes, such as the MUSCL scheme, to avoid the spurious oscillations (wiggles) that would otherwise occur with high order spatial discretization schemes due to shocks, discontinuities or sharp changes in the solution domain. Use of flux limiters, together with an appropriate high resolution scheme, make the solutions total variation diminishing (TVD). Note that flux limiters are also referred to as slope limiters because they both have the same mathematical form, and both have the effect of limiting the solution gradient near shocks or discontinuities. In general, the term flux limiter is used when the limiter acts on system fluxes, and slope limiter is used when the limiter acts on system states (like pressure, velocity etc.). How they work The main idea behind the construction of flux limiter schemes is to limit the spatial derivatives to realistic values ‚Äì for scientific and engineering problems this usually means physically realisable and meaningful values. They are used in high resolution schemes for solving problems described by PDEs and only come into operation when sharp wave fronts are present. For smoothly changing waves, the flux limiters do not operate and the spatial derivatives can be represented by higher order approximations without introducing spurious oscillations. Consider the 1D semi-discrete scheme below, :\\\\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F \\\\left( u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) - F \\\\left( u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) \\\\right] =0, where, F \\\\left( u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) \\\\ and F \\\\left( u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) \\\\ represent edge fluxes for the ith cell. If these edge fluxes can be represented by low and high resolution schemes, then a flux limiter can switch between these schemes depending upon the gradients close to the particular cell, as follows, :F \\\\left( u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) = f^{low}_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} - \\\\phi\\\\left( r_i \\\\right) \\\\left( f^{low}_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} - f^{high}_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right), :F \\\\left( u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) = f^{low}_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} - \\\\phi\\\\left( r_{i-1} \\\\right) \\\\left( f^{low}_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} - f^{high}_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) , where :f^{low} = \\\\ low resolution flux, :f^{high} = \\\\ high resolution flux, :\\\\phi\\\\ (r) = \\\\ flux limiter function, and r\\\\ represents the ratio of successive gradients on the solution mesh, i.e., : r_{i} = \\\\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{u_{i+1} - u_{i}} . The limiter function is constrained to be greater than or equal to zero, i.e., \\\\phi\\\\ (r) \\\\ge 0 . Therefore, when the limiter is equal to zero (sharp gradient, opposite slopes or zero gradient), the flux is represented by a low resolution scheme. Similarly, when the limiter is equal to 1 (smooth solution), it is represented by a high resolution scheme. The various limiters have differing switching characteristics and are selected according to the particular problem and solution scheme. No particular limiter has been found to work well for all problems, and a particular choice is usually made on a trial and error basis. Limiter functions The following are common forms of flux/slope limiter function, \\\\phi\\\\ (r) : CHARM [not 2nd order TVD] (Zhou, 1995) : \\\\phi_{cm}(r)=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\frac{r\\\\left(3r+1\\\\right)}{\\\\left(r+1\\\\right)^{2}}, \\\\quad r>0, \\\\quad\\\\lim_{r\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\phi_{cm}(r)=3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\quad \\\\quad\\\\, , \\\\quad r\\\\le 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right.

His replacement as Labour candidate, Pat Wall, was a founder of the Militant tendency, and when Labour Party leader Michael Foot visited to support him, full-page newspaper adverts placed by the Conservative Party reprinted part of a speech in which Wall had declared that a Marxist Labour government, on coming to office \\"will face bloodshed. We will face the possibility of civil war and the terrible death and destruction and bloodshed that would mean\\".Michael Crick, \\"Militant\\", Faber & Faber, 1984, p. 176, 198. In addition, the SDP candidate Peter Birkby was a well known former Labour agent.\\"The Almanac of British Politics\\", ed. Robert Waller, Croom Helm, 1983, p. 191. At the end of the campaign, Michael Foot was challenged by Robin Day in a televised interview to say whether he would back Pat Wall or Ben Ford. Foot replied \\"I'm not going to answer in that way\\".Richard Heffernan and Mike Marqusee, \\"Defeat from the Jaws of Victory\\", Verso, 1992, p. 33. When the votes were counted, Lawler was declared elected with a majority of 1,602 over Pat Wall; he had won with only 34.3% of the vote but with the twelfth biggest swing to the Conservatives in Britain. Lawler became the first Conservative to win a Parliamentary seat in Bradford since 1970.Ivor Crewe and Anthony Fox, \\"British Parliamentary Constituencies: A Statistical Compendium\\", Faber & Faber, 1984, p. 70. He later declared that he had not expected to win.\\"'It was honour but now I enjoy running my firm'\\", Yorkshire Post, 25 October 2007. Parliament Lawler made his maiden speech on 22 July in a debate on regional industrial policy; he complained that Yorkshire had suffered from an inequality of treatment, but that the regional assistance in the manner provided since the second world war was inappropriate to contemporary needs. He did not support massive public intervention.\\"MP seeks more aid for the north\\", The Times, 23 July 1983, p. 4. After demanding an inquiry into under- employment, in late 1983 he called on the Government to abolish or privatise the Crown Agents. Lawler voted to reintroduce the death penalty for murderers of police or prison officers only, and against its reintroduction generally, in July 1983. In January 1985 he was one of 70 Conservative MPs to break the whip and vote to reject a planning inspectors' report supporting expansion of Stansted Airport. In November 1984, his name was drawn as sixteenth in the annual ballot for twenty MPs to introduce a Private member's bill;Anthony Bevins, \\"MP's Bill to curtail glue sniffing should be law within year\\", The Times, 16 November 1984, p. 5. he introduced the Fabric Origin Marking Bill which would require the country of origin to be indicated; his Bill made no progress. After the Bradford City stadium fire, he noted that the death toll would have been much worse had there been a fence in front of the stand to stop pitch invasions. He asked for money to be made available to build a new stand as quickly as possible.\\"Football Judicial inquiry to cover football crowd safety and control\\", The Times, 14 May 1985, p. 4. Lawler spoke strongly in favour of televising the House of Commons in November 1985, arguing that if the public did not like what they saw, then Parliament should look to itself to change.Hansard, HC 6ser vol 87 col 319. In July 1986 he owned up to leading a plot among backbench MPs to make sure there were enough present at 1 AM to vote to increase the allowances used to pay for secretaries and researchers by 50%. The Government had proposed an increase of only 6% and Mrs Thatcher complained the following day about the increase in the cost of Parliament.Richard Evans, \\"Ministers angered at allowances revolt\\", The Times, 18 July 1986. As vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench employment committee, he protested against comments by Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane who had called for lower sentences for people found to have committed benefit fraud; Lawler described Lane's comments as \\"an affront to all law-abiding people who declare their incomes and pay all their taxes, and equally to those who are honest claimants of social security and depend on it for their income\\".\\"Softer sentences recommended for social security fraud\\", The Times, 25 March 1987. Leaving Parliament Due to the circumstances of his 1983 win, Lawler's chances of retaining the seat at any subsequent election were not rated highly; Lawler himself knew that his seat was \\"highly risky\\". He made strenuous efforts to attract the votes of Asian residents of the constituency, who did not traditionally vote Conservative.Harry Goulbourne, \\"Black Politics in Britain\\", Avebury, 1990, p. 69. Although the Conservative vote in Bradford North increased by more than 3,000, Lawler was defeated in the 1987 election by Pat Wall, who was standing again, by 1,633 votes. He noted that being an MP \\"doesn't give you many additional recognisable skills other than being a good communicator\\", but since he had previously worked in public relations before his election, he returned to the same field. Lawler subsequently submitted his name for selection in several constituencies for the 1992 general election (among them Finchley, following Margaret Thatcher's announcement of her retirement)New Statesman and Society, Vol. 3, p. 11. but after several narrow defeats was not selected anywhere.David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, \\"The British General Election of 1992\\", Macmillan, 1992, p. 228, note 4. In 1991 he set up on his own as managing director of The Public Affairs Company, a political consultancy based in Leeds. A few days after the 2005 general election, Lawler wrote to The Times to remark that the Conservative Party's strategy was \\"misconceived\\" and that the negative tone \\"repelled many people and buried the positive reasons that would attract them to support the Conservatives\\"; he appeared to blame Lynton Crosby by calling for no more immigration by \\"election experts from Australia\\".\\"Conservative leadership and policy for future elections\\" (Letter), The Times, 11 May 2005, p. 16. In 2010 Lawler joined Keene Public Affairs, and was promoted to its board of directors in July 2011.\\"The week in lobbying\\", PR Week, 15 July 2011, p. 7.

Life Born in New York City, he graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1961, Harvard University in 1965 and Harvard Business School in 1967. After leaving Harvard Caputo went to work in the Office of the Secretary of Defense who at the time was Robert McNamara whose Systems Analysis unit hired recent business school graduates to work on various policy issues. During his first four years of working Caputo went to law school at night and received a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1971. In 1969 Caputo was one of the four co-founders and a board member and principal stockholder of ICF International, a management consulting company. it grew through the years. On May 23, 2019 it had a market value of $1.4 billion based on the trading of its public shares on that day. In fiscal year 2018, it had sales of $1.38 billion. Initially focusing on energy and health care issues, the company later expanded into environmental businesses and began to build engineering capabilities. In 1988 ICF acquired Kaiser Engineers, which had originated as the engineering unit of Henry J. Kaiser's industrial empire and grew to rank among the largest engineering and construction companies in the world. The following year (1989) the combined company went public and eventually traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The company operated as \\"ICF Kaiser,\\" with the consulting unit remaining largely intact. In 1999, ICF Consulting ended its decade-long affiliation with Kaiser Engineers through a leveraged buyout, financed in part by the CM Equity Partners, LP, an equity investment firm based in New York City. In 2006, ICF Consulting was renamed ICF International to reflect its growing geographic presence and the increased scope of its offerings from advisory services through implementation and improvement. The firm completed an initial public offering (IPO) and now is a publicly traded firm listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol ICFI. Caputo was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1972, representing a district in Yonkers. He was re-elected in 1974, and sat in the 180th and 181st New York State Legislatures. Caputo served on the Assembly Ways and Means, Housing and Insurance committees. In 1976, Republican Congressman Peter A. Peyser gave up his seat to challenge U.S. Senator James L. Buckley for the Republican nomination. Caputo ran for the congressional seat and won, defeating Democratic Assemblyman J. Edward Meyer, a former Republican who became a Democrat in 1973. Caputo's district included Yonkers, three towns in lower Westchester and the Woodlawn, Wakefield, Williamsbridge, Edenwald, Eastchester and Baychester sections of the Bronx. Caputo served on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs committee and the Ethics committee. In 1978, Perry Duryea, the Republican leader of the State Assembly and front runner for the Republican nomination for governor, picked Caputo as his running mate for lieutenant governor. The Republican state convention nominated them both in fall of 1978. Governor Hugh L. Carey, a Democrat who was elected in 1974, and his lieutenant governor running mate, Mario Cuomo, narrowly defeated the Duryea-Caputo ticket. Following the 1978 elections Caputo served out his term in Congress and joined the management consulting firm Booz-Allen Hamilton in its mergers and acquisitions and banking departments. In 1980, Caputo entered the Republican primary against U.S. Senator Jacob Javits, but withdrew after his main rival on the right, Alfonse D'Amato, secured the nomination of the Conservative party.New York Magazine, May 25, 1981, \\"Caputo Copies D'Amato Act\\" in PDF through Google Books D'Amato defeated Javits in the Republican primary and won the general election in the fall. In his autobiography, \\"Power, Politics, and Pasta: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato\\" (1995), D'Amato bitterly criticized Caputo. In 1981, President Reagan nominated Caputo as an alternate United States delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. The Senate confirmed the nomination and Caputo began serving in the spring of that year. Early in 1982, Caputo announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was seeking a second term in the 1982 mid-term election. Considered a young rising star in the Republican Party, Caputo raised money around the country but withdrew from the race after failing to get the support of key Republican and Conservative Party county leaders. The Moynihan campaign told several news outlets that Caputo served in the military when in fact was a civilian at the PentagonNew Yorker, June 23, 2008, \\"Postscript: U.S. News &World; Report, June 13, 2008, \\" 1950-2008: Gone Much Too Soon\\"New York Times, February 21, 1982, \\"Headliners: Caputo's Army The entry for Caputo in the official Congressional biography publication, known as the Blue Book, contained no reference to military service.

Caputo's campaign material contained no such reference. Caputo read and approved in advance the Congressional and State Legislature biographies. In fact, Caputo worked as a civilian analyst at the Pentagon.New York Times, February 21, 1982, \\"Headliners: Caputo's Army Later that year, Assemblywoman Florence M.

Mongolia's 1956 census counted ethnic Chinese as 1.9% of the population; the United States government estimated their proportion to be 2% in 1987, or roughly 40,000 people. The 2000 census showed 1,323 permanent residents of Chinese descent; this figure does not include naturalised citizens, temporary residents, nor illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants from China were estimated at 10,000 in the 1990s; some use Mongolia as a transit point into Russia. Turkic Khaganate Chinese artists were hired by Bilge Khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate. Chinese text on a silk piece of yellow color was found in a Turkic tomb. Liao Dynasty During the Liao dynasty Han Chinese lived in Kedun, situated in present-day Mongolia. Han farmers migrated in. http://www.china10k.com/trad/history/5/51/51.htm http://blog.renren.com/share/229436183/9016553483 Chinese migrated to cities under Liao rule.

Ming dynasty The Liaodong Han Chinese military frontiersmen were prone to mixing and acculturating with (non-Han) tribesmen. Han Chinese soldiers served in the Yuan army against the Ming, and the Mongols were joined by many Chinese defectors. The Mongol Mangui served in the Ming military and fought the Manchus, dying in battle against a Manchu raid. Some Chinese who lived among the Mongols of Inner Mongolians, while in their youth, adopted Mongol culture and married a Mongol women but when he became old he would come back and lived with the Han Chinese again. One Han Chinese military officer who defected to the Mongols was \\"Monkey Li\\" (Li Huai) who fought against the Ming. Qing Dynasty Chinese temple in Maimachin, 1885 Historically, the Gobi served as a barrier to large-scale Chinese settlement in what was, before 1921, called Outer Mongolia; the unsuitability of most of the territory for agriculture made settlement less attractive. Some Chinese settlements in Mongolia were founded in 1725, when farmers moved there by decree of the Qing Dynasty to grow food for soldiers fighting the Dzungars. They were established in the Orkhon and Tuul river basins, and in 1762, in the Khovd region. After the fighting ended, the Qing closed off Mongolia to immigration and occasionally evicted Chinese merchants. Despite those restrictions, Chinese trade firms continually penetrated the country, concentrating mainly in Ikh Kh√ºree, Uliastai, Khovd and Kyakhta. Their trade practices and the lifestyle of the Mongolian nobility lead to an ever- increasing indebtedness of the banners, nobles, and ordinary people, and Chinese businesses became a target of public discontent as early as Ching√ºnjav's uprising in 1756. The spill-over from the Dungan rebellions of the 1870s into Mongolia also saw a number of Chinese businesses in Khovd and Uliastai destroyed. Many of the Chinese merchants lived in Mongolia only seasonally or until they had made enough money to return to China. Others took Mongolian wives, at least for the time of being in Mongolia. In 1906, the Qing Dynasty began to implement policies aimed at a Han-Chinese colonization of Outer Mongolia along the lines of those in Inner Mongolia, but these policies never took full effect because the Dynasty collapsed and Mongolia declared independence in 1911. The total Han Chinese population at that time, mainly consisting of traders and artisans, but also of some colonists, can be estimated to have been at some ten thousand. Since 1911 Urga to Beijing, written by Chinese merchant. Upon Mongolia's declaration of independence, many Chinese became victims of atrocities, particularly in Khovd. However, after 1912, Chinese businesses were able to continue their operations, including collection of debts, largely unimpeded. It was only the establishment of communism that meant an end to Chinese trade in Mongolia. Ever-increasing obstacles to commerce were created, and the closure of the border to China for imports in 1928 meant an end for Chinese enterprise in the country. With the People's Republic of China development aid projects of the 1950s, many Han Chinese entered Mongolia, beginning in 1955. By 1961, they had reached a number of 20,000. However, after the Sino-Soviet split in the early 1960s, in which Mongolia sided with the Soviets, China eventually withdrew most of its workers. At the same time, Mongolian politicians or academicians with alleged links to China (e.g. Ts. Lookhuuz or G. S√ºkhbaatar) became victims of political purges. In the early 1980s, Ulan Bator was reported to have a small Chinese community, which published a Chinese-language newspaper and which looked to the Chinese embassy there for moral support. However, in 1983, Mongolia systematically began expelling some of the remaining 7,000 Chinese contract workers in Mongolia to China. At the same time, ethnic Chinese who had become naturalized citizens were reported to be unaffected. Because the presence and the status of Chinese residents in Mongolia were politically sensitive subjects, Mongolian sources usually avoided mentioning the Chinese at all. After the introduction of democracy, another wave of Chinese immigrants has entered the country. Many of the migrants work in the construction sector, while others run small or medium enterprises. Negative sentiment against Chinese migrants remains; China is seen as a potential threat to Mongolia's security and cultural identity. However, not all recent immigrants from China are ethnic Han Chinese; in particular, there is a number of Inner Mongolians.

History Claybrooke Magna with Claybrooke Parva were listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being within the wapentake of Guthlaxton,Open Domesday: Claybrooke Magna and Parva, accessed March 2020. which centuries later was referred to as a hundred. The manor was managed by a local lord named Fulco, who was subordinate to the tenant-in-chief, the wise and powerful Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. According to information sourced from the Vision of Britain in the 1870s, Claybrooke was described as: \\"CLAYBROOKE, two townships in Lutterworth district, Leicester; and a parish partly also in Warwick. One of the townships bears the name of Great Claybrooke; lies near the junction of Watling-street and the Fosse way, 1 mile WSW of Ullesthorpe r. station, and 4 NW of Lutterworth; occupies high ground, commanding an extensive view; includes the site of the Roman station Vennon√¶; and has a post office, of the name of Claybrooke, under Lutterworth. Pop., 424. Houses, 103. The other township bears the name of Little Claybrooke; and lies contiguous to Great Claybrooke. ...\\" The population and wealth of the region grew, leading locally to partition of the ancient parish of Claybrooke into the civil parish of Claybrook Magna and the adjoining civil parish of Claybrooke Parva in the late 1800s. Claybrooke Magna has seven grade II listed buildings. Including the Claybrooke Mill House, Manor Farmhouse, Vineyard House, Claybrooke Mill, Claybrooke Mill House, Ashleigh and the Dairy Farmhouse. The Watermill dates from 1763 and was extended in 1840. It is stated that milling has taken place at the watermill for over 1000 years and most of the mill machinery is still intact and the mill continues to be in commercial operation. In 2014, Miller Sally Craven produces over 40 different varieties of flour at the Watermill. There is a varied product range and includes traditional flour types as well as unusual blends such as Chilli Flour Mix and Spicy Tomato Flour Mix which shows how the mill has diversified since its establishment in 1763. These products are sold and available from local outlets. The Vineyard Dairy Farmhouse includes an early 17th-century stable which was altered in the late 17th century. It is thought that the stable was originally part of an agricultural complex. It became a listed building on 30 September 1993. Claybrooke Magna Village Hall - geograph.org.uk - 134506Claybrooke Village Hall is a traditional Victorian building located along the main street, which has been modernised in recent years to offer facilities for social and sporting events within the local community.

In the 1960s new homes were built in Claybrooke on the site of the original woodyard and listed buildings Claybrooke Mill and Claybrooke Hall were refurbished. Although local amenities diminished resulting in the village shop and post office closing. In 1972 Whitmores Timbers relocated their site in Bury St Edmunds to its current centrally located site within the village of Claybrooke Magna. The remains of the chapel still remain in Claybrooke but serve the purpose of storing machinery from the woodyard. Claybrooke Magna has previously accommodated three pubs within the village, one of these being 'The Blue Bell' which was closed in the 1920s and had an alternate use as a bakehouse after closure. In 1986 it was recorded as being the private house of 'The White House' but according to records has since been demolished. 'The Royal Oak' was situated on the Main Road and was known as The Woodcutter at time of closure. Although, the village is currently home to a local pub called 'The Pig in Muck'. In July 2013, it opened its very own brewery to the general public. Allowing the general public to see how the beer is brewed. It is now brewing the Pig Pub Brewery cask conditioned beers which are all served within the pub and also at a sister pub located in Leicester City Centre. In 1997, TV actor Barry Evans was found dead at his home in Claybrooke Magna. A youth was charged with attempted murder but later released. The exact circumstances surrounding his death remain a mystery. Demographics Total population of Claybrooke Magna Civil parish, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1881 to 2011 According to the 2011 Census, Claybrooke Magna had a population of 613. There were also 222 households in the area. The Topographical Dictionary of England was published in 1848 and details the population of Greater Claybrooke as 514 and Little Claybrooke as 104. Pie chart showing population of Claybrooke Magna in different industry sectors using census data Historically in Claybrooke Magna, men were employed by the timber mill or worked on the land, but now few men who live within Claybrooke Magna are employed in this sort of primary and secondary employment. The 2001 census found that 26.7% of residents work within the extractive and manufacturing industries, whereas 73.3% work in the service industries. This trend is concordant with the trend within England as it was found that in 2011, less than one in 100 people worked in agriculture in England and Wales. In 2014, there is unemployment among younger members of Claybrooke Magna which could be attributed poor public transport facilities and a large majority of the working population commute to larger towns within the area such as Leicester or Coventry for work.

The housing in the area was originally small cottages, but during the industrial revolution many streets of back-to-back terrace houses were built to house the influx of workers. Upper Accommodation Road is the historic heart of the area with some of the more historic buildings on the west side and newer ones on the east. A Leeds Industrial Co-operative building from 1902 is on a corner with East Park Road. In the 20th century much of the housing stock was updated with schemes such as the Saxton Gardens. The Saxton Gardens estate has since been redeveloped by Urban Splash to create 410 homes, allotments and the largest communal garden in the city.http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=20031010_91073245&DISPLAY;=FULL Four churches were built in the area.

A will may contain more than one testamentary trust, and may address all or any portion of the estate. Testamentary trusts are distinguished from inter vivos trusts, which are created during the settlor's lifetime. There are four parties involved in a testamentary trust: *the person who specifies that the trust be created, usually as a part of his or her will, but it may be set up in abeyance during the person's lifetime. This person may be called the grantor or trustor, but is usually referred to as the settlor; *the trustee, whose duty is to carry out the terms of the will. He or she may be named in the will, or may be appointed by the probate court that handles the will; *the beneficiary(s), who will receive the benefits of the trust; *Although not a party to the trust itself, the probate court is a necessary component of the trust's activity. It oversees the trustee's handling of the trust. A testamentary trust is a legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will, and is occasioned by the death of that person. It is created to address any estate accumulated during that person's lifetime or generated as a result of a postmortem lawsuit, such as a settlement in a survival claim, or the proceeds from a life insurance policy held on the settlor. A trust can be created to oversee such assets. A trustee is appointed to direct the trust until a set time when the trust expires, such as when minor beneficiaries reach a specified age or accomplish a deed such as completing a set educational goal or achieving a specified matrimonial status. For a testamentary trust, as the settlor is deceased, he or she will generally not have any influence over the trustee's exercise of discretion, although in some jurisdictions it is common for the testator to leave a letter of wishes for the trustee. In practical terms testamentary trusts tend to be driven more by the needs of the beneficiaries (particularly infant beneficiaries) than by tax considerations, which are the usual considerations in inter vivos trusts. If a testamentary trust fails, the property usually will be held on resulting trusts for the testator's residuary estate. Some famous English trust law cases were on behalf of the residuary legatees under a will seeking to have testamentary trusts declared void so as to inherit the trust property. An infamous example is Re Diplock [1951] Ch 253, which resulted in the suicide of one of the trustees who was personally liable to account for trust funds that had been disbursed for what he thought were perfectly valid charitable trusts. Advantages of a testamentary trust *A testamentary trust provides a way for assets devolving to minor children to be protected until the children are capable of fending for themselves; *A testamentary trust has low upfront costs, usually only the cost of preparing the will in such a way as to address the trust, and the fees involved in dealing with the judicial system during probate. Disadvantages of a testamentary trust *The trustee is required to meet with the probate court regularly (at least annually in many jurisdictions) and prove that the trust is being handled in a responsible manner and in strict accordance with provisions of the will which created the trust. This may involve considerable legal fees, especially if the trust endures for several years or involves a sophisticated financial or investment structure, and always involves the fees imposed by the judicial system. Such fees and expenses are deducted from the principal of the estate; *The trustee must be prepared to oversee the trust for its duration, which involves a considerable commitment in time, possible emotional attachment, and legal liability; *A candidate for trustee may be named in the will, but that person has no legal obligation to accept the appointment. If no trustee is named in the will (or is unavailable, even if named), the probate court will appoint a trustee; *It can be difficult for beneficiaries to bring a dishonest trustee to account. They may sue at law, or the malfeasance may be pointed out at the annual probate court review, but such remedies are slow, time-consuming and expensive, and are not guaranteed to succeed. Summary Due to the potential problems, lawyers often advise that a revocable living trust or inter vivos trust be created instead of a testamentary trust. However, a testamentary trust may be a better solution if the expected estate is small compared to potential life-insurance settlement amounts.

He was described as the world's longest serving \\"intelligence chief\\". He was born in 1939 to a Kabyle family from Guenzet (S√©tif Province), but grew up near Algiers at Saint-Eugene (Bologhine). He joined the National Liberation Army in 1961, a few months before Algeria's independence. He was an officer for the NLA. Little is known of him, but he was regarded as a leading power behind the scenes and a leading general in the \\"eradicator\\" military faction. Only two known public photos of him exist; they are both unclear.  Career  = Post-independence = Shortly after independence, he joined other NLA military members in studying at a KGB school in the Soviet Union. He was then posted to the 2nd military region (around Oran, bordering Morocco), then commanded by future President Chadli Bendjedid, where he established ties with Larbi Belkheir. In 1983, he was posted to Tripoli as military attach√©. Soon after returning, he became head of presidential security for Bendjedid. He later became head of army security in the S√©curit√© Militaire, led at the time by Mohamed Betchine. After Betchine's departure in 1987, Mediene was appointed general and a temporary chief of the intelligence organization. Soon after taking charge, he oversaw a reorganization of the S√©curit√© Militaire, and renamed it the D√©partement du renseignement et de la s√©curit√© (DRS). = After the 1991 election = At the time of the 1991 legislative election, which was won by the Islamic Salvation Front, Mediene joined a group of ruling generals in Les √©radicateurs (\\"the Eradicator\\") faction. This name derives from the goal of eradicating the Islamists, as opposed to negotiating with them. This group is regarded as behind the military coup that followed the election's first round. The Eradicator faction is regarded to have gained and held power during the civil war triggered by the military coup. Since the 1992 coup, a \\"shadowy\\" group of generals and intelligence officers known to the Algerians collectively as le pouvoir (‚Äúthe power‚Äù) and whose individual members are called d√©cideurs has dominated Algerian politics with the FLN reduced down to a mere front for le pouvoir. Little is known for certain about le pouvoir, but Mediene has frequently been mentioned as a leading d√©cideur. Officially, the languages of Algeria are Arabic and Berber, but in practice, most Algerians speak a language called Darija that is a mixture of Arabic, Berber and French, which explains why French expressions are often used in Algeria. Arabic has been the official language of Algeria since 1962, but French remains the language of power in Algeria and cabinet meetings are conducted in French, the language of the Algerian elite, who often struggle with Arabic. During the civil war, the DRS, led by Mediene, headed efforts to repress Islamist groups. DRS agents, which reportedly number as high as 100,000, infiltrated and manipulated terrorist groups, and stopped efforts in both ruling and opposition groups to negotiate with the ISF. In 1993, he was promoted to general-major, and in July 2006, he was promoted to Lieutenant General (G√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e.) Although he supported President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as part of the Eradicator faction, Mediene through the DRS was later believed to be involved in a power struggle with Bouteflika. After supporting Bouteflika's first three terms, he did not support his fourth term bid, announced in January 2014. Preceding this, Ahmed Gaid Salah, the Deputy Minister of Defense, accused the DRS of complacency in failing to prevent the In Amenas hostage crisis. And in September 2013, the DRS was reorganised to bring more of it under state control. In February 2014, the secretary general of Bouteflika's party, the FLN, accused the DRS of infiltrating and destabilizing several political parties. Through the DRS' networks, Medi√®ne was believed to hold significant power in Algeria's media, business lobbies, army, and different political parties. The Economist wrote in 2012 that \\"The most powerful man in the land may be Mohamed Medi√®ne, known as Toufiq...\\". In 2013 The Economist reported: \\"Despite his leading role in defeating Islamic militants in a brutal civil war between 1991 and 2000, and his less public role as kingmaker in the pouvoir, General Mediene‚Äôs face remains unknown; it is said that anyone who has seen it expires soon after.\\" A popular rumor in Algeria that cannot be verified has it that Medi√®ne \\"always receives people in his office with his back turned - if you see his face, this is the last time you see someone in your life.\\" Regardless if this rumor is true or not, the popularity of this rumor says much about Medi√®ne's reputation in Algeria, a man widely viewed as the \\"Darth Vader\\" of Algerian politics. A popular game in Algeria is attempting to identify Medi√®ne by examining photographs from the 1980s and 1990s of official functions to see if he can be found. On 13 September 2015, it was announced that Medi√®ne was retiring and President Bouteflika had appointed Athmane Tartag to succeed him.\\"Algeria removes top intel chief after years in powerful post\\", Associated Press, 13 September 2015. Medi√®ne's dismissal was viewed as the culmination of a long \\"behind-the- scenes power struggle\\" with Bouteflika, leaving the latter fully in charge and giving him more power to determine his own successor.Amer Ouali, \\"Algeria president paving way for succession\\", Agence France-Presse, 14 September 2015.

The Mandailing is a traditional cultural group in Southeast Asia. They are found mainly in the northern section of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. They came under the influence of the Kaum Padri who ruled the Minangkabau of Tanah Datar. As a result, the Mandailing were influenced by Muslim culture and converted to Islam. There are also a group of Mandailing in Malaysia, especially in the states of Selangor and Perak. They are closely related to the Angkola.  Etymology  The etymology of 'Mandailing' is said to be a compounding of the words mande, meaning 'mother', and hilang, meaning 'lost'. Thus, the name is said to mean \\"lost mother\\". The Mandailing society is patriarchal, employing family names, or marga. The well known margas in Mandailing clan are: Lubis, Nasution, Siregar, Hasibuan, Harahap, Dalimunthe (originally from Munthe), Matondang, Rangkuti, Parinduri, Pulungan, Rambe, Daulae(y), Pohan, Batubara (not to be confused with the Batu Bara people from the east coast of Sumatra), Barus and Hutajulu.  History  Plating mats and pounding rice in Pakantan. According to Tamboen's account (1952) the Mandailing, along with other sub- ethnic Batak groups are the descendants of one man by the name of Batak; who migrated to the south before the coming of the Portuguese and Dutch colonisation of Sumatra. Moreover, many Mandailing people are Minangkabau descent from Pagaruyung in Minangkabau highlands, such as Nasution clan.Sepenggal Sejarah Marga Nasution Milik Bobby Menantu Jokowi Dutch colonization in Sumatra caused the Mandailing to be typecast as a sub-category of the Batak, as a 'wedge policy' to classify the communities and create typologies. It instilled the division of the Islamic nations by a non-Muslim belt, called 'Bataklanden' (Bataklands).Abdur-Razzaq Lubis. Mandailing-Batak- Malay: A People Defined and Divided. In: 'From Palermo to Penang: A Journey into Political Anthropology', University of Fribourg, 2010. The Mandailing were associated with the Toba Batak people instead of being recognized as a distinct ethnic minority. Consequently, the Mandailing people have been torn between two cultural and ethnic identities, namely Batak-Mandailing in Indonesia and Malay-Mandailing in Malaysia. = The Padri War = The Padri War, which took place in West Sumatra and spread to the inland parts of East Sumatra between 1803 and 1845, caused an exodus of large groups of Mandailing from their homeland to peninsular Malaya. Among them were groups led by Raja Asal, the overlord of the Mandailings, and his nephew Raja Bilah. Together with Sutan Puasa, they were embroiled in the Klang War from 1866 to 1873, also known as the Selangor War.Abdul-Razzaq Lubis and Khoo Salma Nasution. Raja Bilah and the Mandailings in Perak: 1875‚Äì1911. Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (MBRAS), 2003. Raja Asal and Raja Bilah fled to Perak, where their followers settled in Lower Perk and the Kinta Valley. The British appointed Raja Bilah penghulu of Blanja while his son Raja Yacob became penghulu of Tronoh, which generated large revenues after the opening of the Tronoh Mines, the largest tin producer in the world in the 1920s.  Region  Mandailing is the name of region Luat Mandailing, which is now almost in Mandailing Natal Regency in North Sumatra. The first group who came to this region were the Lubis and Nasution, later followed by the Siregar, Harahap and so forth. Nasution and Lubis are the biggest groups in Mandailing clan. While other groups, such as Pulungan, Harahap, Matondang, Rangkuti, and others are the smaller groups of Luat Mandailing. Harahap and Siregar dwell almost in Luat Angkola, which now belongs to South Tapanuli Regency, situated between Regency and North Tapanuli Regency.  Migrations  Pilgirims of Mandailing people in Mecca, 1880. The Mandailing people are also known as the great travellers as more and more of the Mandailings are migrating to the various regions in the country as well as around the world. Many of the Mandailings are playing the important roles of the nation. The Indonesian government considered the Mandailings as one of the main tribes in the country. Many Mandailings keep detailed family tree records as it has become the family tradition. It is reported that 98% of the Mandailing ethnic group are Muslim. There are approximately more than one hundred thousand Mandailings In Malaysia nowadays. Many of the Mandailings in Malaysia are visiting their ancestors in Mandailing Regency in Indonesia as it has been a tradition to keep the brotherhood and strong bond of unity among the Mandailings. The Mandailing language is still used by the descendants of Mandailing immigrants in Malaysia, although language shift to Malay is observed among the younger generation.  Culture  The Mandailing classic of daun ubi tumbuk or mashed tapioca leaves, lush with bunga kantan, lemongrass and coconut milk flavor is a famous food among the Mandailing people. They have a traditional ensemble of drums called Gordang Sambilan. Controversy The generalization of the term \\"Batak\\" being applied to the Mandailing people are not accepted by the those who descended from their customary region, although majority of the population consider themselves as part of Batak ethnic group. The Mandailing people has blood ties, kinship, language, writing script, social systems, arts, customs and norms that are different from the Batak and Malay people.

The visual artist F√©licien Rops's body of work and Joris-Karl Huysmans's novel Against Nature (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States.Dictionary of Critical Theory - Oxford Reference, pp.113-114 The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion, and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world. Central to the decadent movement was the view that art is totally opposed to nature in the sense both of biological nature and of the standard, or \\"natural\\", norms of morality and sexual behaviour. Overview The concept of decadence dates from the 18th century, especially from the writings of Montesquieu, the Enlightenment philosopher who suggested that the decline (d√©cadence) of the Roman Empire was in large part due to its moral decay and loss of cultural standards. When Latin scholar D√©sir√© Nisard turned toward French literature, he compared Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure. The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent movement. =French Decadent movement= The first major development in French decadence appeared when writers Th√©ophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire used the word proudly to represent a rejection of what they considered banal \\"progress\\". Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of Les Fleurs du mal and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He later used the term decadence to include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression. In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 Les Fleurs du mal, Gautier at first rejects the application of the term decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language. Though he was Belgian, F√©licien Rops was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent movement. A friend of Baudelaire, he was a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself. Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror. He explicitly was interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman. At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure. It has been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry \\"requires a strong stomach.\\" Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil. For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind. The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors. The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barr√®s referred to a particular group of writers as Decadents. He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by Gothic novels and the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe. Many were associated with Symbolism, others with Aestheticism.A Chronology , retrieved December 24, 2009 The pursuit of these authors, according to Arthur Symons, was \\"a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life\\", and their achievement, as he saw it, was \\"to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul\\". In his 1884 decadent novel √Ä rebours (English: Against Nature or Against the Grain), Joris-Karl Huysmans identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: Paul Verlaine, Tristan Corbi√®re, Theodore Hannon and St√©phane Mallarm√©. His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with \\"insidious delight\\" as they used a \\"secret language\\" to explore \\"twisted and precious ideas.\\" Not only did Against Nature define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art. The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of Gustave Moreau, Jan Luyken and Odilon Redon. None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement. Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world. It has been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by F√©licien Rops. Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine Le D√©cadent in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent movement in a formal way. This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would improve humanity. Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and Le D√©cadent, even including some who had been published in its pages. Rival writer Jean Mor√©as published his Symbolist Manifesto, largely to escape association with the Decadent movement, despite their shared heritage. Mor√©as and Gustave Kahn, among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction. Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju. After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of Le D√©cadent publishing works falsely attributed to Arthur Rimbaud, however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well. Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations. Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque. Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in Le D√©cadent include Albert Aurier, Rachilde, Pierre Vareilles, Miguel Hern√°ndez, Jean Lorrain and Laurent Tailhade. Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents. In France, the Decadent movement is often said to have begun with either Joris-Karl Huysmans' Against Nature (1884) or Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal.Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement by Paul Bourget, retrieved December 24, 2009 This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when Le D√©cadent closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy. A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave Mirbeau, but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art. Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty. In France, the heart of the Decadent movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of fin de si√®cle, or end-of-the-century gloom. As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as David Weir, regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between Romanticism and Modernism, especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy. = Distinction from Symbolism = Symbolism has often been confused with the Decadent movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and Impressionism, as rebellions against realism. He defined this common, decadent thread as \\"an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over- subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity\\". He referred to all such literature as \\"a new and beautiful and interesting disease\\". Later, however, he described the Decadent movement as an \\"interlude, half a mock interlude\\" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism. It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature. They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement. Maurice Barr√®s referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (St√©phane Mallarm√©) as a symbolist. Even Jean Mor√©as used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885. Only a year later, however, Jean Mor√©as wrote his Symbolist Manifesto to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and Le D√©cadent. Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested. In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism. In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to F√©licien Rops, Gustave Moreau, and Fernand Khnopff as \\"Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers.\\" Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called \\"dissidents\\" for remaining in the Decadent movement. Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists. In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's Stanford University course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.  On nature  Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different. Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when St√©phane Mallarm√© mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in \\"Flowers.\\" Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans‚Äô Against Nature, for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: ‚ÄúThere is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice.\\"  On language and imagery  Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend. In the words of symbolist poet St√©phane Mallarm√©: > Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is > missing...no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of > Truth Herself Incarnate...how impossible it is for language to express > things...in the Poet's hands...by the consistent virtue and necessity of an > art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy. Mor√©as asserted in his manifesto on symbolism that words and images serve to dress the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood. Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images. Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's Dorian Gray being poisoned by a book like a drug. Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: \\"The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself.\\"  On reality, illusion, and truth  Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society. Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths. In Mallarme's poem ‚ÄúApparition‚Äù, for instance, the word ‚Äúdreaming‚Äù appears twice, followed by ‚ÄúDream‚Äù itself with a capital D. In ‚ÄúThe Windows,‚Äù he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: ‚ÄúSo filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.‚Äù In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies. In contrast, Decadence states there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth because there is no secret, mystical truth. They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing. If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment. The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, even the gory and the shocking. In The Temptation of Saint Anthony, decadent Gustave Flaubert describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror. Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: \\"But isn‚Äôt it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?\\"  On art  Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of ‚Äúsymbols‚Äù that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter. According to Mor√©as, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to \\"esoteric primordial truths\\" that cannot ever be directly approached. Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice. It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps laid this out most clearly in The Decay of Lying with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list: # \\"Art never expresses anything but itself.\\" # \\"All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals.\\" # \\"Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life\\" After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Mor√©as' search for shadow truth: \\"Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\\"  Influence and legacy  = Collapse of the Decadent movement = In France, the Decadent movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents. Paul Verlaine and St√©phane Mallarm√© were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's Le D√©cadent for a time. Others kept a foot in each camp. Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for Le D√©cadent and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism. Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of Le D√©cadent even though her own one-act drama The Crystal Spider is almost certainly a symbolist work. Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether. Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider Against Nature as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope. Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them. He left decadence for anarchy. = The Decadent movement beyond France = While the Decadent movement, per se, was mostly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly. Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat trangressive spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess. Many were also influenced by the Decadent movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake. ; Bohemia Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know. They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie. They were poor and hungry for something better. The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable. It was that melancholy that drove their art. These Bohemian decadent writers included Karel Hlav√°ƒçek, Arno≈°t Proch√°zka, Ji≈ô√≠ Kar√°sek ze Lvovic, and Louisa Zikova. One Czech writer, Arthur Breisky, embraced the full spirit of Le D√©cadent with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure. From the Decadent movement he learned the basic idea of a dandy, and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they. ; Britain Aubrey Beardsley, The Peacock Skirt, illustration for Oscar Wilde's Salome, 1892 Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer Oscar Wilde, poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, as well as other artists and writers associated with The Yellow Book. Others, such as Walter Pater, resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals. While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in The Picture of Dorian Gray. British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess. At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation. Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: \\"Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.\\" Swinburne explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry when he wrote \\"Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies  Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'\\" In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals. Wilde had a secret homosexual life. Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation. ; Italy Medardo Rosso, Sick child, 1903-04 Italian literary criticism has often looked at the decadent movement on a larger scale, proposing that its main features could be used to define a full historical period, running from the 1860s to the 1920s. For this reason, the term Decadentism, modelled on \\"Romanticism\\" or \\"Expressionism\\", became more substantial and widespread than elsewhere. However, most critics today prefer to distinguish between three periods. The first period is marked by the experience of Scapigliatura, a sort of proto- decadent movement. The Scapigliati (literally meaning \\"unkempt\\" or \\"dishevelled\\") were a group of writers and poets who shared a sentiment of intolerance for the suffocating intellectual atmosphere between the late Risorgimento (1860s) and the early years of unified Italy (1870s). They contributed to rejuvenate Italian culture through foreign influences and introduced decadent themes like illness and fascination with death. The novel Fosca (1869) by Igino Ugo Tarchetti tells of a love triangle involving a codependent man, a married woman and an ugly, sick and vampire-like figure, the femme fatale Fosca. In a similar way, Camillo Boito's Senso and his short stories venture into tales of sexual decadence and disturbing obsessions, such as incest and necrophilia. Other Scapigliati were the novelists Carlo Dossi and Giuseppe Rovani, the poet Emilio Praga, the poet and composer Arrigo Boito and the composer Franco Faccio. As for the visual arts, Medardo Rosso stands out as one of the most influential European sculptors of that time. Most of the Scapigliati died of illness, alcoholism or suicide. The second period of Italian Decadentism is dominated by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Antonio Fogazzaro and Giovanni Pascoli. D'Annunzio, who was in contact with many French intellectuals and had read the works of Nietzsche in the French translation, imported the concepts of √úbermensch and will to power into Italy, although in his own particular version. The poet's aim had to be an extreme aestheticization of life, and life the ultimate work of art. Recurrent themes in his literary works include the supremacy of the individual, the cult of beauty, exaggerated sophistication, the glorification of machines, the fusion of man with nature, the exalted vitality coexisting with the triumph of death. His novel The Pleasure, published one year before The Picture of Dorian Gray, is considered one the three genre-defining books of the Decadent movement, along with Wilde's novel and Huysmans's Against Nature. Less flashy and more isolated than D'Annunzio, and close to the French symbolists, Pascoli redefined poetry as a means of clairvoyance to regain the purity of things. Finally, the third period, which can be seen as a postlude to Decadentism, is marked by the voices of Italo Svevo, Luigi Pirandello and the Crepusculars. Svevo, with his novel Zeno's Conscience, took the idea of sickness to its logical conclusion, while Pirandello proceeded to the extreme disintegration of the self with works such as The Late Mattia Pascal, Six Characters in Search of an Author and One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand. On the other side, the Crepuscular poets (literally \\"twilight poets\\") turned Pascoli's innovations into a mood-conveying poetry, which describes the melancholy of everyday life in shady and monotonous interiors of provincial towns. These atmospheres were explored by the painters Mario Sironi, Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi. Guido Gozzano was the most brilliant and ironic of the Crepusculars, but we can also remember Sergio Corazzini, Marino Moretti and Aldo Palazzeschi. ; Russia Portrait of by The Decadent movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine. The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure. Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death. Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that eventually inspired the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent movement. The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent movement included Konstanin Balmont, Fyodor Sologub, Valery Bryusov, and Zinaida Gippius. As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence. Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury. They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were Konstantin Somov, , and Nikolay Feofilaktov. ; Spain Some art historians consider Francisco de Goya one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ram√≥n Casas and Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time. Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. Emilia Pardo Baz√°n with works like Los Pazos de Ulloa where terror and decadent topics appear. El monstruo (The Monster), written by Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent belongs to Decadent movement. But the Decadent movement is overlapped by the Fin de Siglo Movement with the authors of the Generaci√≥n del 98 being part-decadent: Ram√≥n Mar√≠a del Valle-Incl√°n, Unamuno and P√≠o Baroja are the most essential figures of this period. ; United States Few prominent writers or artists in the United States were connected with the Decadent movement. Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of fin de si√®cle France. An exception to this is the decadent poet George Sylvester Viereck- who wrote (1907) \\"Nineveh and Other Poems\\". Viereck states in his \\"The Candle and the Flame\\" (1912) Poet Francis Saltus Saltus was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style occasionally was compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation. He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry. At the time, mostly before Baju's Le D√©cadent, this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent movement. The younger brother of Francis, writer Edgar Saltus had more success. He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life. For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue. At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them. Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent movement in France and tried to bring it with him to New York. He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place. Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.  Critical studies  German doctor and social critic Max Nordau wrote a lengthy book titled Degeneration (1892). It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms. His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan. What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of \\"degeneration,\\" a neuro-pathology that resulted in these behaviors. It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barr√®s, members of the Decadent movement who were in the public eye. In 1930 Italian art and literature critic Mario Praz completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as The Romantic Agony (1933). The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way. His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries. The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.

It is the oldest and largest member of Britain's Liberal Judaism, a constituent member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Claude Montefiore's Jewish Religious Union, established in 1902, opened a prayer association in a converted chapel at Hill Street, London 18 (Map), on 4 February 1911. Within a year, Hebrew Union College graduate Rabbi Israel Mattuck was appointed minister. By 1915, the congregation had 416 members and grew, reaching 784 in 1921. A permanent edifice at St John's Wood, with a capacity of 1,400 people and designed by architect Ernest Joseph, was dedicated on 13 September 1925. Leo Baeck, an internationally famous rabbi and Holocaust survivor, served as the synagogue's president (Fox 2011). Lily Montagu was a spiritual as well as a lay leader at the synagogue and a member of the LJS Council from its inception until her death (Fox 2011). Rabbi Mattuck conducted services until 1947, retiring to function as Rabbi Emeritus, and was replaced by his former assistant, Leslie Edgar. John Rayner was senior minister between 1961 and 1989. He was succeeded by David Goldberg, who was in turn replaced by Alexandra Wright in 2004. The synagogue employs the Lev Chadash denominational prayerbook. Since its earliest days, it has had mixed- gender seating. Current rabbis Rabbi Alexandra Wright serves as the senior rabbi. The rabbinic team also consists of Rabbi Elana Dellal, an American graduate of the Hebrew Union College and Rabbi Igor Zinkov, a Russian graduate of the Leo Baeck Institute in London.Our People Liberal Jewish Synagogue.

The first prayerbook produced by Rabbi Mattuck appeared in 1912 and was influenced by American Reform Judaism and Rabbi David Einhorn's Olat Tamid (Fox 2011). In 1962 a new Haggadah was produced by Rabbi John Rayner and Rabbi John Rich of South London Liberal Synagogue. In 1973 Rayner produced a new prayerbook, Service of the Heart to replace Mattuck's earlier prayerbooks. Rayner aimed to strike a balance between traditional and modern liturgical materials. The older establishment was happy to continue with Mattuck's more radical approach, while an increasing number of congregations felt the need for a more tradition kind of service and more Zionism (Fox 2011). Service for the Heart was succeeded by Siddur Lev Chadash in 1995, again edited by Rayner (Fox 2011). A successor, Siddur Shirah Chadashah is currently being produced. It will fulfil more closely the traditional concept of a siddur, that is a prayer book for Shabbat, the three daily services and for home ceremonies.So, what‚Äôs going to be in the new Siddur? Liberal Judaism. 27 June 2019 Over the years, there has been a gradual re-introduction of some of the traditional rituals and forms of worship abandoned by the synagogue's early leaders. In the 1930s and 1940s the synagogue began to accommodate the different traditions of an increasing number of congregants that were refugees from Europe. The greater impetus for traditional rituals also came from the context of the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 (Fox 2011). The conducting of the Kiddush began for the first time after the war and Friday night services were introduced in 1945. In the 1970s and 1980s, with the encouragement of Rabbi John Rayner and Rabbi David Goldberg, an increasing number of men began to wear a kippah, a practice which is now the norm (Fox 2011). The rabbis also moved the congregation towards a greater use of Hebrew in the services (Fox 2011). In 1912, Rabbi Mattuck introduced Confirmation ceremonies, marking a young person's graduation from the Religion School at the age of sixteen. At the time they did not exist in Anglo-Jewry, but were customary in Reform synagogues in the United States (Fox 2011).The Confirmation Revolution: Then and Now Union for Reform Judaism. 21 May 2015 The ceremonies later became known as Kabbalat Torah (Confirmation) by Rabbi Rayner, as a part of a trend towards the greater use of Hebrew (Fox 2011). In the 1970s there was mounting pressure for the introduction of Bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies from congregants who felt that Confirmation at age sixteen was not sufficient. The synagogue agreed to introduce Bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies in 1981, with the understanding that the students will then continue with their later Kabbalat Torah studies (Fox 2011). This continues to be the status quo at the synagogue. The original synagogue at the St John's Wood location was erected during 1924 and designed by Ernest Joseph, it was dedicated on 13 September 1925. The portico of the new synagogue consisted of six ionic columns made of Portland stone that were donated by Bernhard Baron, a philanthropist and synagogue member (Fox 2011). Inside, there was seating for 1, 350 people and a communal hall, named Montefiore Hall, which could accommodate a further 500 people. There were also several classrooms upstairs (Fox 2011). In November 1940, during the Blitz, the building sustained heavy damage from an enemy bomb. It was restored, and reopened with a celebratory service on 24 September 1951.Alderman, Geoffrey, Modern British Jewry, Oxford University Press, 1998. p. 354 In 1984, the discovery of structural defects convinced the board to demolish and rebuild the sanctuary, whilst maintaining the original portico. The right to build flats above the new synagogue was sold to a developer to help subsidise the project (Fox 2011). A concluding prayer was held on 30 April 1988, before relocating to a deconsecrated church hall in Loudoun Road near Swiss Cottage (Fox 2011). Fitzroy Robinson & Partners was commissioned to design the shell of the new building. Israeli architects, Kantor Schwartz, working closely with Koski Solomon, were tasked with designing the Sanctuary.The LJS: A Guide to the Building The Liberal Jewish Synagogue. Accessed on 15 March 2020 In 1988 the original portico was taken down and kept in storage for three years at the London Docklands while the new synagogue was being built. It was then cleaned and reinstated 1.2 metres from its original position. The front facade replicates the original facade of the 1925 building; the apparent windows are dummies to appear as in the original building. The entrance hall includes a memorial to the six million Jews who perished in the Shoah. The stone, a three-ton Kilkenny limestone, is the work of the eminent sculptor Anish Kapoor (born in Bombay of a Jewish mother in 1954).Reflections of a memorial to the Holocaust The Independent. 1 November 1996 The Sanctuary was conceived as octagonal. The bimah and three lecterns are made of oak and is enclosed by a high curved wall of Jerusalem stone. The stone was quarried from Hebron by a family whose employees had traditional skills of tooling the stone. The wall was hand- finished in London by a team of Israelis. The ark was designed as the focus of the wall; the doors are a mesh of metals set in frames of bronze. The design and inset of the doors were carried out in Israel by sculptor Amit Schur, while the bronze frame and closing mechanism were manufactured under her direction in Sheffield. On 13 January 1991, the new edifice was dedicated and reconsecrated the following year (Fox 2011). The building was praised in The Times newspaper by Religious Correspondent, Ruth Gledhill praising the five- star architecture, warmer atmosphere and the 'spiritual high' (Fox 2011). In the 1990s the new building attracted a marked increase in weddings and press attention from the weddings of high-profile couples such as Simon Sebag Montefiore and his wife, Santa Montefiore (Fox 2011).Society girl Santa joins the ranks of religious converts The Independent. 4 October 1998 Activities The synagogue lent its support to refugees from Nazi Germany. Rabbi Mattuck raised funds to enable German refugees to come to England. The money that Mattuck raised allowed 156 refugees to escape persecution. Synagogue congregants assisted the refugees with securing employment and the Women's Society tried to ensure that the children they helped had a Jewish education, especially if they lived with non-Jewish families (Fox 2011). The synagogue also hosted a club for German refugees, organising dances, lectures and music recitals (Fox 2011). The German refugees also began to run language lessons and conducted their own services. They eventually founded their own congregation, Belsize Square Synagogue (Fox 2011). In the 1970s and 1980s the synagogue turned its attention towards the plight of Soviet Jewry, becoming particularly supportive of the refuseniks. An LJS Soviet Jewry Committee was established in 1977 by Doreen Isaacs. The members supported demonstrations and marches, they visited refusenik families in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Odessa. They adopted refuseniks and sent messages of support, Rosh Hashanah cards, Chanukkah greetings and seder services for Passover. The committee produced 100, 000 Russian/Hebrew seder services which were sent out into the Soviet Union. The haggadot with the LJS initials printed were also sent out by Orthodox congregations, with the blessing of the Chief Rabbi, Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits (Fox 2011).

A first mention of Gottmadingen was in 965. Until the construction of the Singen - Schaffhausen railway line it was a tiny village. Economic growth began in the 20th century. Due to the high demand for workers in the new factories the number of inhabitants grew rapidly. Gottmadingen's industry was mainly based on the production of agricultural machinery. In the years 1960s and 1970s more than 4,000 workers were employed in the \\"Fahr\\" factory for agricultural engines. The factory was closed in 2003. Today's economy is based on several companies that settled on the former \\"Fahr\\" factory area. The municipal area of Gottmadingen comprises also the outlying villages of Bietingen, Ebringen and Randegg, as well as the hamlet Murbach. Both Bietingen and Gottmadingen itself have railway stations and benefit from rail connections to Schaffhausen and Singen.

The population of the civil parish (including Ashby Folville and Barsby) at the 2011 census was 762. It is located around southwest of Melton Mowbray and northeast of Leicester. Gaddesby has 170 households and a population of around 450, while the parish, which includes the nearby villages of Ashby Folville and Barsby, has a total population of 762 according to the 2011 Census. Recent housing development has made Gaddesby a popular, rural dormitory for Leicester. History Gaddesby's name is derived from the Old Norse words gaddr and by, indicating that it was a settlement during the Danish occupation of England between the 9th and 11th centuries. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Gadesbi, a mainly pastoral village with a mill, within the hundred of Goscote. Parish Church The sculpture of a dying horse and rider on a marble chest, in memory of Col. Edward Cheney in 1848 The Grade I listed St Luke's Church was originally built as a Norman chapel - a single space without a tower. It was part of the soke of Rothley from the tenth century. The two aisles, North and South, the tower and the Chancel were added in the thirteenth century and elaborated in the next two hundred years. The church is reputed to have some of the finest examples of fourteenth century stonework in the country which adorn the South West corner on the outside of the Knights Templar's chapel. The oak pews in the nave are probably fifteenth century and the limestone font dates from 1320. There is a peal of eight bells, the earliest dated 1562. The size of the church attests to the importance of the village during the period of its development. Gaddesby had grown as a result of the importance of the wool industry in East Leicestershire. Indeed, it had a weekly market and an annual fair from the fourteenth century. As the wool industry declined and the Western half of the county rose in prominence during the Industrial Revolution so Gaddesby settled back into being a rural backwater. The near life-size marble sculpture of a dying horse and rider on a marble chest, created by Joseph Gott in memory of Colonel Edward Hawkins Cheney, C.B., of the Scots Greys, was originally at Gaddesby Hall. It was moved to the chancel in 1917. The Hall Gaddesby Hall was built on the site of an earlier house called Paske Hall, which was surrounded by a moat and dated back to 1390. This old hall was pulled down in 1744 and the present hall erected. The houses in the village formed part of the estate of Gaddesby Hall. Over the years the hall had several owners, including the Nedham, Ayre and Cheney families, all of whom are commemorated in the church. The estate was put up for sale in 1917, at which time the celebrated statue of Colonel Cheney was moved into St Luke's. After suffering neglect and from its use by the American Armed Forces during the Second World War, the hall was reduced in size and renovated during the 1950s. Notable features The village had many springs, and there are still two water pumps in Chapel Lane. On the corner of Chapel Lane and Cross Street, a large boulder called \\"the blue stone\\" marks a spot from which John Wesley is reputed to have preached. The Methodist chapel was demolished in 1966. Many listed and older properties, including former hunting lodges, still exist. An old windmill remains just outside Gaddesby. A cross country running race, the Gaddesby Gallop, is organised before Christmas. Canon Peter Spink (1926‚Äì2010), Anglican priest, was born here.

He represented Renfrew South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1867 to 1871 and in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 1869 to 1872 and from 1874 to 1878. He was born in Golden Lake, Ontario, Upper Canada in 1838, the son of John Lorn McDougall, Sr.. He studied at the High School of Montreal and then at the University of Toronto. He entered his father's business in Renfrew, taking over the operation of the business in 1860, when his father died. He served several terms as reeve of Renfrew and also was warden for Renfrew County. His lumber business failed in 1878 and, shortly afterwards, he was named to the post of Auditor General of Canada. The Public Accounts Audit Act of 1878 established an auditor general who was independent of government financial operations and had some degree of independence from the party in power. His attention to detail, efforts to tighten controls on government spending and persistence ruffled some feathers, but ultimately helped establish the importance of this role. Unfortunately, because his office relied on information provided by government departments, some instances of fraud went undetected. Despite resistance from government departments, he helped improve financial control by parliament and established annual reports on government spending. He resigned in 1905 and opened a private company that performed audits for companies and municipalities. He died in Ottawa in 1909 after suffering a series of strokes. He was appointed CMG in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours.

North American Models The XS Eleven made its debut in 1978 as the largest capacity then in production. It featured dual front disc brakes, a rear disc brake, shaft drive and cast wheels. In 1979, Yamaha followed the growing trend of offering a \\"factory custom\\" version of the bike, called a \\"Special\\" by Yamaha. Pullback handlebars, a stepped seat, a smaller, fatter rear wheel, a smaller capacity tear-drop gas tank, fully adjustable suspension, and altered frame created a factory custom, forerunner of the modern cruiser. The XS Eleven Special sold well despite complaints about the poor ergonomics. \\"What that translates to is a bike with an awkward riding position but generally excellent road manners. In fact, most of the things that irritated this staff in the way the bike rode and handled could be traced to the handlebar, which, although certainly as trendy as disco dancing, was not what the ergonomics doctor ordered for precise, comfortable control.\\"Cycle Guide, February 1979 For the 1981 model year, an even more touring oriented version of the XS Eleven was produced. This model, dubbed the Venturer was equipped with a fairing made by Pacifico for Yamaha. Venturers included matching trunk and hard bags. Additionally, the Venturer included a 6.3 gallon tank for increased range while touring. XS Eleven models were superseded by the 1982 XJ1100 Maxim which used an engine based very closely on the XS1100 unit. The XJ1100 Maxim was only built for one year, before being phased out. European Market In Europe, the XS Eleven differed from the North American model by having a larger petrol tank (6.3 US gallons vs. 5.3 US gallons), a lower handlebar and longer exhaust pipes. The European market also featured the 1.1 Sport with small cockpit fairing, and Martini 1.1 complete with the two piece Mockett fairing (designed by John Mockett), with colour scheme similar to the bike that Mike Hailwood used as his personal transport at the 1978 Isle of Man TT. History The XS Eleven was the first four-cylinder four-stroke motorcycle from Yamaha. It exploited well-proven technology, first used by Yamaha in their previously released XS 750 four-stroke triple. When the XS Eleven was introduced, it earned a reputation as a heavy, powerful bike. In 1978 and 1979 it won Cycle Worlds Ten Best Bikes as the best Touring bike. \\"Nobody gets far riding the XS Eleven before they become acquainted with the fact that it's strong; we had ridden ours over hundreds of open-road miles before going to the drag strip and knew it was a bullet.\\"Cycle, January 1978 Cycle Magazine had this to say of the Eleven: \\"...the XS is a Rolls Royce with a blown Chrysler Hemi motor...\\" The handling of the XS Eleven was not as well received. \\"When this behemoth of a motorcycle actually hits a corner at anything approaching interesting speeds then it takes a good deal of muscle to lay it down. While the Yamaha doesn't disgrace itself in corners (not as much as some Z1000s I have known, for example) it doesn't commend itself either.\\"SuperBike, April 1978 Testers of the day all echoed the same story: \\"The XS1100 was a solid bullet in a straight line, but cornering at high speeds was done at your own risk.\\" \\"Cycle warned its readers that the bike could easily go, stop and steer ‚Äî just never two at the same time.\\" 'Which Bike' magazine simply described the XS1100 as having 'a bullet proof motor, and tea trolley handling'. Endurance racing The XS Eleven went endurance racing in Australia for promotional reasons. The chassis was developed for months and as stated by Cycle World then \\"after which 'parts-book engineering'... (that is, the parts book gave the modified parts official existence, but just try ordering them!).\\" The XS Eleven enjoyed a series of wins and high placed finishes in the Australian motorcycle endurance racing circuit between 1978 and 1981, its success helped by a larger fuel capacity than the competition. Darryl Flack of Motor Sport Retro wrote: \\"While the new CBX1000 and Suzuki were out and out sports bikes, the shaft-drive XS1100, affectionately called the 'Xcessive', was more of a muscle bike come tourer. Heavier than and not as fast as its rivals, the XS1100 did have one particular ability ‚Äì winning races.\\" \\"In the lead up to the Six-Hour, the XS1100 had swept the Adelaide Three-Hour, the Perth Four-Hour and the Surfers Three-Hour. The unlikely XS1100 and Pitman Yamaha rider Greg Pretty had upstaged the biggest, baddest production bikes around, confounding everyone.\\" In the 1979 Castrol 6 hour, XS Elevens finished second (Greg Pretty, Jim Budd) third (Len Atlee, Gary Coleman) and fourth (Roger Heyes and D. Robbins) The XS Eleven's successful racing career was a remarkable achievement considering its shaft drive and long distance touring capabilities. British motorcycle journalist Roland Brown, says in his book Superbikes of the Seventies: \\"The Yamaha's lack of reputation gives it one advantage these days, though, in that a clean XS such as this one costs less than its more successful contemporary rivals ‚Äì whose performance advantage, so crucial then, is far less important now. Two decades and more after its launch, maybe the XS1100's time has finally come.\\" Performance In a 1978 test by Cycle World a stock XS1100 ran a quarter mile time of 11.78 s 1/4 mile @.

Biography George Howell was born in Wrington, Somerset, the eldest of eight children of a builder and contractor.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 He was educated at a Church of England primary school in Bristol until the age of twelve, when he began work with his father, who owned a small builders. By the week he worked twelve hours a day as a mortar-boy, and later a bricklayer, but dedicated Sundays to reading. Among his favourite books were John Foxe's Book of Martyrs and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. Howell grew to dislike his work as a builder so became an apprentice shoemaker. Some of the men he worked with were active chartists and introduced him to radical newspapers including the Northern Star and the Red Republican. As a result, he joined the chartist movement in 1848. Others of his colleagues were Methodists, and Howell attended some of their meetings at Wrington Chapel, before becoming a lay preacher. He also became involved in the local temperance movement. Howell moved to London in 1854 where he resumed work as a bricklayer, unable to find employment as a shoemaker. He attended many radical political meetings and met prominent radical thinkers of the day, including Karl Marx, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh and Frederic Harrison. He joined the Operative Bricklayers' Society (a New Model Trade Union) in 1859, and played a part in leading the London builders' strike in support of a nine-hour working day. Through his work with the union he became one of the foremost New Model unionists, along with Robert Applegarth and George Potter, but was blacklisted by employers for five years. He was elected, along with Potter and Applegarth, to the executive of the London Trades Council (LTC) in 1861 and became its secretary. He also became involved in the campaign for universal suffrage, becoming full-time secretary of the Reform League in 1865. Howell organised demonstrations in London in 1866 and 1867, and played an important role in the campaign behind the 1867 Reform Act. However, Howell was not satisfied with the scale of the reform and continued to campaign for universal suffrage. In 1871 Howell was appointed secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and regularly contributed to the trade unionist journal The Bee-Hive as well as publishing a number of books throughout the 1870s. Howell stood for parliament unsuccessfully at Aylesbury in the general elections of 1868 and 1874 and at Stafford in a by-election in 1881. He finally succeeded in 1885 as Lib‚ÄìLab candidate for Bethnal Green North East, London. In Parliament, Howell helped to pass the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and successfully defended his seat in 1886 and 1892 but was defeated by the Conservative Mancherjee Bhownagree in 1895. In poor health, Howell retired from public life. His old friend Robert Applegarth and the TUC raised a ¬£1650 testimonial to buy him an annuity before his death in 1911. On 17 September 1910, he died at 35 Findon Road, Shepherd's Bush, and was buried at Nunhead Cemetery.

The poem contrasts the traditional representation of the rural idyll in Augustan poetry with the realities of village life. History In early 1781 Crabbe wrote a letter to statesman and author Edmund Burke asking for help, in which he included samples of his poetry. Among the samples that Crabbe sent to Burke were pieces of his poems The Library and The Village which Burke viewed favourably, giving Crabbe a gift of money to relieve his immediate wants, and assuring him that he would do all in his power to further Crabbe's literary career.Ainger (1903) pp. 26‚Äì29 The Village was published in May 1783. Critical reception Samuel Johnson said of the poem in a letter to Reynolds, \\"I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe's poem, which I read with great delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.\\"Kebble (1888) p. 45 Johnson's friend and biographer James Boswell also praised The Village.

She studied acting and singing at the Webber-Douglas School of Singing, and was talent spotted in a school production and cast in the title role in a West End play, Martine in 1933. She was at the peak of her popularity during the 1930s. She was married from August 1934 until 1939 to Basil Dean, a British stage and film writer, director and producer. Dean reportedly grew interested in Hooper due to her resemblance to a former lover of his, actress Meggie Albanesi (died 1923). Dean promoted Hopper's career and cast her as the leading lady in several major films for Associated Talking Pictures in the mid-1930s. However, the films did badly at the box office and her career waned.

Black also had spells with Luton Town and Grimsby Town where he picked up honours for both clubs. He also appeared in the Football League for Sheffield United and Millwall before finishing his career with Lincoln City. Career =Luton Town= Black started his career with his home town club of Luton Town where he notched up just under 150 appearances for the club in all competitions between 1987 and 1991. He won the League Cup with Luton Town in 1988. He also scored twice at Derby County on the final day of season 1989-90 as Luton dramatically avoided relegation by winning 3‚Äì2; thus relegating Ron Atkinson's Sheffield Wednesday side. =Nottingham Forest= Black was then signed for ¬£1.5 million by Brian Clough for Nottingham Forest. While with Forest, he was loaned out twice, making appearances for Sheffield United and Millwall, he also played International football for Northern Ireland making 30 appearances and scoring one goal. Black managed over 100 appearances before his departure to Grimsby Town for ¬£25,000. =Grimsby Town= Black slotted into the Mariners midfield but was unable to stop the club losing their First Division status. Despite the relegation Black committed himself to the Mariners, even though the club struggled early in the 1997/1998 season, Town went on to finish 3rd in the league. Promotion was achieved via the play-offs after the club beat Fulham and Northampton Town. The Mariners also saw success in the Associate Members' Cup in which they defeated AFC Bournemouth at Wembley Stadium. Bournemouth led in the game before Black made the tie all square to send the game into extra time. Wayne Burnett scored the golden goal to send Grimsby home with the trophy. Black went on to feature for Grimsby in the first division for the next three seasons. When manager Alan Buckley was sacked in September 2000, he was replaced by Lennie Lawrence who in turn brought in midfielders Menno Willems, Knut Anders Fostervold, Neil Murray and most notably Leicester City youngster Stuart Campbell. With this Black found it hard to get a look in with the club, but avoided the chop unlike unfavoured utility man Adam Buckley. Black was instead put up for loan, and joined Lincoln City. The Imps would later appoint former Grimsby boss Alan Buckley as their new manager. Black returned to Blundell Park towards the end of the season and was deemed surplus to requirements by Lawrence. Despite being held in high regard by the club's supporters, Black was released from the club. =Lincoln City= After his release from Grimsby, he joined other former Grimsby players Adam Buckley, Ian Hamilton and Andy Smith by joining Lincoln City. Black's spell at Lincoln was marred by the club's overall poor performance, and the financial turmoil it was in, which would later see the club enter into administration towards the end of the season. Alan Buckley left the club by mutual consent, and in came another former Grimsby Town player Keith Alexander as the new manager. Financially, Lincoln were saved, and they escaped relegation to the Football Conference. Having featured only featured once in the 2002‚Äì2003 season, as a substitute in the 3‚Äì0 home victory over Macclesfield Town on 26 August 2002, Black agreed to leave the Imps by mutual consent, reaching a satisfactory agreement of a severance deal on 10 October 2002. Black decided to retire from the game at the age 34 despite being offered several contracts from other clubs. Personal life He returned to Grimsby to play in John McDermott's testimonial against Hull City in 2005 in which he was joined by the majority of his former teammates from the 1997/1998 season. In 2008, he played in an exhibition match with the players from the Luton League cup win in honour of the late David Preece. After retiring from the game, Black still lives in Luton with his Son Charles and daughter Tabitha.

It is the birthplace of Pierre Cardin. History =Ancient History= Today's San Biagio di Callalta was once inhabited by Veneti, an Indo-European population that settled in north-eastern Italy after the middle of the second millennium BCE and developed its own original civilization during the next millennium. During Roman times the Veneto was part of Regio X Venetia et Histria. The territory gained greater importance thanks to the construction of the Via Annia, the Via Postumia and a road that connected them. Artifacts of that period have been found in the hamlets of Rovar√® (terracotta fragments) and Spercenigo (funeral urn and a wine amphora) along with a cremation furnace ruin in Ca'Lion.http://www.comune.sanbiagio.tv.it/p/vivere/cenni-storici/storia-del- comune San Biagio di Callalta gets its name from San Biagio (bishop and martyr) and to the military road \\"Callis Alta\\", originally built in the 10th or 11th century, after the original ancient route between Tarvisium and Opitergium had been abandoned.Id. In the late Roman period (3rd and 4th century CE) two sites are mentioned that were in the territory of what was to become San Biagio: Prandecinum, corresponding to present day Rovar√®, and Caurillium, corresponding to present day Cavri√®. =Middle Ages= With the advent of Christianity, in these two sites, two churches were erected: Santa Maria de Caurillium, one of the first churches named as part of the new Diocese of Tarvisium and San Lorenzo in Prandecino, which was destroyed in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Other ancient churches in the territory of San Biagio are San Martino, San Floriano, San Menna, San Sisto a Nerbon, built over an ancient mound, the church of Spercenigo and the old parish church of San Biagio, built in the late 1300s but now in ruins. At the end of the tenth century, the territories of the future San Biagio were part of the area of influence of the powerful Abbey of Monastier.Actually named the Abbey of Santa Maria del Pero, it is located in the adjacent comune of Monastier di Treviso The work of the Benedictine monks here led to the development of the settlements of Rovar√®, Fagar√® and San Andrea di Barbarana.See storia @ http://www.comune.sanbiagio.tv.it/ In 1314 the parish known as ‚ÄúCaurille‚Äù moved south of the ‚ÄúCallis Alta‚Äù military road and embankments that were built to counteract the floods of the Piave River. Thus starting from the fourteenth century along this road a new town arose ‚Äì San Biagio, the current municipal capital ‚Äì with the resulting decline of Cavri√® and Pradencino. The ‚ÄúCallalta‚Äù divided the territory of San Biagio into two parts: the part to the North belonged to the Zosagna di Sopra (from 1339, Venice provided an administrative arrangement of the Treviso territory or podesteria, which encompassed San Biagio) and included the localities of Cavri√®, Valdrigo, Camporocoler, San Biagio, Campolongo, Fagar√®, Volta di Fagar√® and Villatella, the South belonged to Zosagna di Sotto and included Spercenigo, Bagnon, Rovar√®, Riva de Perdencin, Nerbon, San Florian and Villa Cucca. The area had fallen into the orbit of Treviso and followed its fate until the final inclusion in the Republic of Venice, at the end of the fourteenth century. During the period of the Republic of Venice, San Biagio enjoyed relative tranquility. Venice needed access to large quantities of oak and beech timber. The island city itself was devoid of any forests, so it turned to its mainland holdings for this vital resource.Appuhn, Karl, A Forest on the Sea, Environmental Expertise in Renaissance Venice, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (2009) Magnificent villas were built here, erected by the nobles and patricians of Venice, including the Sugana, Sala, Giudici, Da Lezze, Navagero and Caotorta. =Modern Era= Bombed-out house with the famous quotation of the Italian Army at the Battle of the Solstice in Sant'Andrea di Barbarana The territory was administered by the Republic of Venice until its fall of May 12, 1797. After the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio and the assignment of the territory to Austria, the area was part of the Habsburg Empire. The territory remained (more or less) under Austrian sovereignty until the outcome of the Third War of Italian Independence, when the Armistice of Cormons transferred the Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy which was ratified with the signing of the Treaty of Vienna (1866) on October 3, 1866. San Biagio was affected by the consequences of the outbreak of the First world war especially after the Battle of Caporetto in 1917. Then the front line moved to the Piave River and forced the people of the area to exit to the Po Valley while the Austro-Hungarian armed forces bombarded their home territory causing considerable damage. The involvement reached its peak, when in June 1918, the Battle of the Solstice was fought here. This was the last great offensive launched by the Austro-Hungarians during the conflict and the Italian Army held, turning the tide of the war. To commemorate the tragic event, the ossuary of Fagar√®https://c20society.org.uk/war-memorials/italy- fagare-della-battaglia-sacrario-militare/ Italy: Fagar√® Della Battaglia, Sacrario Militare was erected, along the Callalta Road, where the Austro- Hungarian troops reached their furthest advance. The ossuary contains two famous quotations: *\\"Tutti eroi! O il Piave, o tutti accoppati!‚Äù ‚Äî Everyone a hero! Either the Piave, or be killed! *‚Äú√à meglio un giorno da leone che cento anni da pecora.\\" ‚Äî It is better to spend one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

Geography =Location= Constituent communities The market community is one of the most heavily populated communities in the Aschaffenburg district and is well known for the ‚Äúhousing‚Äù that encloses the Autobahn A 3\\\\. It is believed that the name has its roots in the yellow loess soil, which during heavy rainfalls colours the local brook, also called the Goldbach, with a somewhat golden tinge. Gold is also the German word for gold, and Bach means ‚Äúbrook‚Äù. Supposedly, the place was first called Gelbbach, gelb being the word for ‚Äúyellow‚Äù. =Constituent communities= On 1 July 1971, the formerly self- administering community of Unterafferbach was amalgamated with Goldbach. History In 1218, Goldbach had its first documentary mention. From the mid 15th century, Goldbach was under the authority of the Archbishop of Mainz. In 1814, Goldbach was transferred to Bavaria. On 26 May 1995, Goldbach was granted the designation Markt (‚ÄúMarket‚Äù).

The German blazon describes the coronet as a Laubkrone, or ‚Äúleaf crown‚Äù. The ‚Äúbend wavy Or‚Äù ‚Äì that is to say, wavy slanted golden stripe ‚Äì is canting. As explained above, the community‚Äôs name means ‚ÄúGold Brook‚Äù, and this bend is a visual representation of just such a thing. From the 7th to the 11th century, Goldbach belonged to the area of the Frankish royal estate, which is what the crown symbolizes. Until 1803, Goldbach found itself under Electoral Mainz hegemony, a fact recalled by the Wheel of Mainz on the other side of the bend. The tinctures Or and gules (gold and red) are taken from the arms once borne by the Counts of Rieneck, who until they died out in 1559 held the Vogtei as the vassals of the Archbishop of Mainz. The arms have been borne since 1965. =Town partnerships= * Courseulles-sur-Mer, Calvados, France since 1994; the commune lies at Juno Beach. Culture and sightseeing =Churches= Goldbach has two Catholic parish churches. The alte Kirche (‚Äúold church‚Äù), as Saint Nicholas‚Äôs Church (St. Nikolaus-Kirche) is called, is found in the old village centre. The sandstone Romanesque Revival church that exists today was built in 1894 and 1895 on the spot where once there was an older building that had become too small. The newer church was later enlarged by adding a modern annex. In the west of the community, which at the time was a new development area, the modern church St. Maria Immaculata was consecrated in 1961, as Saint Nicholas‚Äôs had itself become too small to accommodate the community‚Äôs growing numbers. The plain clinker-brick building with a 37 m-tall asymmetrical tower seats 600. The chancel is graced by a monumental painting by the artist Curd Lessig as well as by a modern octagonal altar lamp whose ornate glass panes depicts Biblical scenes. One peculiarity of the church is its organ threesome. Besides the main organ with its 36 speaking stops, built in 1964 by the organ building firm Michael Weise, the church also has at its disposal a Baroque organ from 1782 that was thoroughly restored in the early 1980s and a positive organ from Hartwig Sp√§th‚Äôs workshop. At community limits with H√∂sbach, the Evangelical Johanneskirche (‚ÄúSaint John‚Äôs Church‚Äù) is situated. =Sport and clubs= In Goldbach there is a lively sport, culture and club life. Drawing attention from well beyond the region is the Winterlaufserie (‚ÄúWinter Run Series‚Äù), carried on TV Goldbach, which is said to cover 10 km on each of nine appointed times. Further clubs are VfR Goldbach, AC Bavaria Goldbach, Gesangverein Harmonie Goldbach (singing club), Gesangverein S√§ngerkranz Goldbach (singing club), KJG St. Nikolaus, KJG St. Maria Immaculata, DJK Goldbach 1985 e.V., MSC Goldbach, KKS Goldbach, BRK Goldbach, Freiwillige Feuerwehr Goldbach (volunteer fire brigade), RG Goldbach, F.W.V. Goldbach. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Goldbach lies right on the A 3 between Frankfurt (roughly 45 km away) and W√ºrzburg (roughly 75 km away). Between Goldbach and H√∂sbach, when the Autobahn was being widened to six lanes, a ‚Äúhousing‚Äù was built over the roadway to reduce the noise pollution. =Public institutions= On the way out of the community, going towards Unterafferbach, is a forest swimming pool. The indoor swimming pool at the elementary school is open to the public in the winter months. Throughout the community are 10 playgrounds, 3 football pitches and 2 sport halls.

To date, Leo Baeck College has trained over 170 rabbis, its alumni serving Jewish communities in the United Kingdom and across the world. Leo Baeck College also pioneered the training of rabbis to serve the Jewish communities of the former Soviet Union and has been at the forefront of Jewish-Christian-Muslim dialogue for decades. In addition to the training of rabbis, Leo Baeck College trains teachers, provides an educational consultancy for religion schools and Jewish day schools, supports the development of community leaders, and provides access to Jewish learning for all through interfaith work. History Before Leo Baeck College was founded there was no institution for training Reform rabbis in Britain. All ministers had either received their training in the United States or were graduates of the Orthodox Jews' College who had later switched allegiance and served Reform synagogues. The College was founded in 1956 as the Jewish Theological College of London for the training of Liberal and Reform rabbis and was seen as a successor organisation to the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin and the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. It was renamed Leo Baeck College shortly afterwards at van der Zyl's suggestion in honour of his teacher, Dr Leo Baeck, the inspirational 20th-century German Liberal rabbi. =Location= The College was originally housed at West London Synagogue and expanded into a new building at the West London Synagogue site in 1963. It moved in 1981 to larger premises at the Manor House (later known as The Sternberg Centre) in North Finchley, along with other institutions within the Progressive movement. This in turn led to a major growth in its activities, especially its extra-mural department, which provided a wide range of day-time and evening activities for the wider public. Its teachers training department also expanded and eventually formed a separate education department that served both the Reform and Liberal movements, later being known as the Centre for Jewish Education (CJE). In 2001 CJE integrated with the old Leo Baeck College to become Leo Baeck College‚ÄìCentre for Jewish Education (LBC-CJE). =Alumni= The College's first two students were Lionel Blue and Michael Leigh, both of whom became distinguished rabbis. Female students had been admitted from the outset, although none graduated as rabbis until Jacqueline Tabick in 1975. Among Leo Baeck‚Äôs other alumni are: Rabbi Tony Bayfield; Rabbi Pauline Bebe, the first woman rabbi in France; Rabbi Harry Jacobi; Rabbi Maurice Michaels, Jewish chaplain to the London 2012 Olympic Games; Rabbi Baroness Neuberger; Rabbi Jonathan Romain; Rabbi Elizabeth Tikvah Sarah; Rabbi Sybil Sheridan; Rabbi Jackie Tabick, the first female rabbi to be trained in the United Kingdom; and Rabbi Alexandra Wright, the first female senior rabbi in England. =Staff= In the first few years almost all the faculty members were refugees from Nazism. Van der Zyl's work was furthered by many others, including Rabbis Hugo Gryn and John D Rayner, who jointly supervised the College's affairs after his retirement. In 1972 Rabbi Albert Friedlander became Director and during his tenure the student body grew in size. Faculty members have also included Rabbi Louis Jacobs and Karen Armstrong. In 1985 Rabbi Professor Jonathan Magonet became the first full-time Principal, a position he held for 20 years, retiring in 2005. He was succeeded by Rabbi Professor Marc Saperstein in the following year, when the combined new College adopted the name Leo Baeck College. Saperstein completed his term of office in July 2011 and continues to teach at the College as Professor of Jewish History and Homiletics. The current Principal (since September 2011) is Rabbi Deborah Kahn-Harris, a graduate of Leo Baeck College and one of the first woman rabbis to lead a mainstream rabbinic seminary. Library The College's library has 60,000 books, including donations of books from the former Hochschule library and many rare editions. Courses The College announced the introduction of a new part-time BA in Jewish education from autumn 2013, the only one of its kind in the country. The BA and the College's existing part-time MA in Jewish education are now validated by the Institute for Theological Partnerships at Winchester University, as is the MA in theology taken by rabbinic students, which was previously awarded by King's College London.

It spreads over a large area, and the plains of the state are quite distinctly different from the high mountains in the north. The climate of this state can also vary widely - primarily due to it being far from the moderating effect of the sea and the occasional cold air arising due to western disturbances - with temperatures reaching as high as 49 ¬∞C in summer, and as low as -1 ¬∞C in Winter.. Location Uttar Pradesh is bounded by Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh on the north-west, Haryana and Delhi on the west, Rajasthan on the south-west, Madhya Pradesh on the south, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand on south-east and Bihar on the east. Situated between 23¬∞52'N and 31¬∞28'N latitudes and 77¬∞3' and 84¬∞39'E longitudes, this is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of area, and the first in terms of population. Uttar Pradesh can be divided into three distinct hypsographical regions : #The Shivalik foothills and Terai in the North #The Gangetic Plain in the centre - Highly fertile alluvial soils; flat topography broken by numerous ponds, lakes, and rivers; slope 2 m/km #The Vindhya Hills and plateau in the south - Hard rock Strata; varied topography of hills, plains, valleys, and plateau; limited water availability. The Shivalik Range which forms the southern foothills of the Himalayas, slopes down into a boulder bed called Bhabar. The transitional belt running along the entire length of the state is called the Terai and Bhabar area. It has rich forests, cutting across it are innumerable streams that swell into raging torrents during the monsoon. The Bhabar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the Bhabar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the Bhabar in a thin strip. The main crops are wheat, rice, and sugar cane. Jute also is grown. The most important area for the economy of the state is the Gangetic plain which stretches across the entire length of the state from east to west. The entire alluvial plain can be divide into three sub-regions. The first is the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well- developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. The Gangetic plain is watered by the Yamuna, the Ganges and its major tributaries, the Ramganga, the Gomati, the Ghaghra and Gandak. The whole plain is alluvial and very fertile. The chief crops cultivated here are rice, wheat, pearl millet, gram, and barley. Sugar cane is the chief cash crop of the region. The southern fringe of the Gangetic is demarcated by the Vindhya Hills and plateau. It comprises the four districts of Jhansi, Jalaun, Banda, and Hamirpur in Bundelkhand division, Meja and Karchhana tehsils of Allahabad district, the whole of Mirzapur district south of Ganges and Chakia tehsil of Varanasi district. The ground is strong with low hills. The Betwa and Ken rivers join the Yamuna from the south-west in this region. It has four distinct kinds of soil, two of which are agriculturally difficult to manage. They are black cotton soil. Rainfall is scanty and erratic and water-resources are scarce. Dry farming is practical on a large scale. Climate The climate of the state is tropical monsoon. The average temperature varies in the plains from 3 to 4 ¬∞C in January to 43 to 45 ¬∞C in May and June. There are three distinct seasons - winter from October to February, summer from March to mid- June, and the rainy season from June to September. The rainfall in the plains is heaviest in the east and decreases towards the north-west. Floods are a recurring problem in the state, causing damage to crops, life, and property. The worst floods were in 1971, when 51 of the 54 districts of the state were affected -- an area of nearly 52,000 square kilometres. The eastern districts are the most vulnerable to floods, the western districts slightly less and the central region markedly less. The eastern districts susceptibility to floods is ascribed, among other things, to heavy rainfall, low flat country, high subsoil water level and the silting of beds which causes river levels to rise. The problem in the western districts is mainly poor drainage caused by the obstruction of roads, railways, canals, new built-up areas etc. There is water logging in large areas. The major flood-prone rivers are the Ganges, Yamuna, Gomti, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sharda and Ramganga. The inadequate drainage capacity of the smaller western Sirsa, Kali and the Aligarh drain is also a cause of floods. Flora and fauna Recorded Forest Area constitute about 6.88% of the total geographical area of the state and Total Forest and Tree cover is 9.01% of total geographical area. The Terai and Bhabar area in the Gangetic Plain have most of the forests. The Vindhyan forests consists mostly of scrub. The districts of Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Ballia have no forest land, while 31 other district have less forest area. =Forests= The existing flora in Uttar Pradesh can be classified into three categories- * Wet tropical deciduous forests. * Dry tropical deciduous forests. * Tropical thorny forests. On the Shivalik foothills and in the terai-bhabhar area grow the sal and gigantic haldu. Along river courses the shisham grows in abundance. The Vindhyan forests have dhak, teak, mahua, salai, chironji and tendu. Sisso is mostly used for furniture while khair yields kattha, which is taken with betel leaves or pan. Semal and gutel are used as matchwood and kanju in the plywood industry. Babul provides the principal tanning material of the state. Some of the grasses such as baib and bamboo are raw material for the paper industry. Tendu leaves are used in making bidis (Indian cigarettes), and cane is used in baskets and furniture. Species of grasses have been collected from the Gangetic plain. Herbs include medicinal plants like Rauvolfia serpentina, Viala serpens, podophyllum, hexandrum and Ephecra gerardiana. =Animal life= Corresponding to its variegated topography and climate, the state has a wealth of animal life. Its avifauna is among the richest in the country. Animals that can be found in the jungles of Uttar Pradesh include the tiger, leopard, wild bear, sloth bear, chital, sambhar, jackal, porcupine, jungle cat, hare, squirrel, monitor lizards, and fox. The most common birds include the crow, pigeon, dove, jungle fowl, black partridge, house sparrow, peafowl, blue jay, parakeet, kite, mynah, quail, bulbul, kingfisher and woodpecker. Certain species are found in special habitats. The elephant is confined to the terai and the foothills. The gond and para also found in this region. The chinkara and the sandgrouse prefer a dry climate, and are native to the Vindhyan forests. Among the game birds resident in the state are the snipe, comb duck, grey duck, cotton teal and whistling teal. Several species of wildlife have become extinct in Uttar Pradesh. Among them are the lion from the Gangetic plain and the rhinoceros from the terai. The fate of many species is uncertain, including the tiger, black buck, serow, swamp deer, bustard, pink-headed duck, and mural pheasants and four-horned antelope. Although determined enforcement of laws against poaching and hunting has yielded some results, the wildlife population today is alarmingly low. Gharials are poached for their skin. To preserve its wildlife the state has established one National Park; Dudhwa National Park and 12 game sanctuaries..

(ca. 1790-November 23, 1872) was the principal chief of the Yamparika or \\"Root Eater\\" division of the Comanche from ca. 1860-72. He was the leader of the Ketahto (\\"The Barefeet\\") local group of the Yamparika, probably from the late 1840s. The ethnonym (group name), Yamparika or \\"Root Eater\\" Comanche was known to the Spaniards of New Mexico as early as the 1750s, but until about 1790, they were generally north of the Arkansas River and so were seldom specifically mentioned in Spanish documents. After that time, with the advance of Cheyennes (Comanche: paka naboo 'striped arrows'), and Cuampes, likely Arapahos, some Yamparika local groups, including the Ketahto, relocated to the valley of the North Canadian River in New Mexico and Texas.  Early life  Ten Bears was orphaned as a baby when his family group was murdered by Lakotas.Attocknie, F. J. (n. d.) \\"The Life of Ten Bears.\\" Manuscript. Later Comanche oral history states that in his young adult years, he was noted for leading horse-mounted spear attacks on Lakota villages. = Rise to political prominence = Ten Bears was a key-figure in making peace between the Comanches and the Utes in 1820. Ten Bears was often in rivalry with a man named either Isakwahip 'Wolf's Back', or Isakiip 'Wolf's Elbow', leader of another local group in the North Canadian valley.Kavanagh, Thomas W. (1996) Comanche Political History. U Nebraska Press. . In 1840 the Yamparika chief, Ten Bears, was one among the principal promoters (together with the Kiowa chiefs Dohasan and Satank and the Arapaho Hosa Little Raven) of the peace and large alliance between the Comanche and Kiowa alliance and the Cheyenne and Arapaho alliance after the Cheyenne and Arapaho's victory at Wolf Creek during the spring 1838. To reach his purpose, Ten Bears (Parrawasamen) was able to gain the approval of such chiefs as the Kotsoteka Shaved Head (Wulea-boo) and, even through Shaved Head‚Äôs support, Big Eagle (a.k.a. Sun Eagle) (Tawaquenah), likely the Nokoni Tall Tree (Huupi-pahati) and certainly the Penateka Buffalo Hump (Pocheha-quehip, Pots ânakwahip â) and Yellow Wolf (Isaviah) and probably the Kwahadi Iron Jacket (Pohebits-quasho); together with Ten Bears (Parrawasamen), probably Tawaquenah and Huupi-pahati, certainly Buffalo Hump (Pocheha-quehip) and eventually Iron Jacket (Pohebits-quasho) represented Comanche nation during the negotiation near the Two Butte Creek, resulting in a peace agreement and a strong alliance between the two groups. Ten Bears first came to the attention of Anglo-Americans in 1853 when he, among others, signed the Treaty of Fort Atkinson. His name was written as \\"Parosawano\\" and translated as 'Ten Sticks', a confusion of /paw â âra/ 'bear' with /paria/ 'dogwood stick'. The error was corrected in the 1854 revision of the treaty. Ten Bears became the principal Yamparika chief about 1860 after the death of the man known to Anglos as 'Shaved Head' (Wulea-boo, possibly a Kotsoteka rather than a Yamparika Comanche); the latter's Comanche name is uncertain as there were several men whom Anglos called by that name. In August 1861 Ten Bears (likely being himself the chief named as ‚ÄúBistevana‚Äù) signed the Fort Cobb Treaty with gen. Albert Pike, the Confederate Indian Commissioner, sanctioning an alliance with the ‚ÄúGray Jackets‚Äù. In 1863, along with a delegation of Western Indians, including Southern Cheyennes, Southern Arapahoes, and Kiowas, Ten Bears visited Washington, but he was unable to get any major concessions for his people from the U.S. government. In November 1864, Ten Bears was the chief of the Yamparika Comanches nearest the ruins of the Bent brothers' old adobe trading post (the first Adobe Walls, Texas, built ca 1840) when troops under Col. Christopher 'Kit' Carson attacked a nearby Kiowa village .Pettis, G. H. (1908) Kit Carson's Fight with the Comanche and Kiowa Indians. New Mexico Historical Society Publications, No. 12 (Santa Fe) Warriors from Ten Bear's village led the counterattack which drove off Carson's men, although one of Ten Bears' sons, Ekamoksu 'Red Sleeve' was killed. = Treaty of the Little Arkansas River = In 1865, Ten Bears and two of his sons, Isananaka 'Wolf's Name' and Hitetetsi 'Little Crow', along with other Comanches, mostly Yamparikas, signed the Treaty of the Little Arkansas River in Kansas. The treaty created a reservation for the Comanches encompassing the entire panhandle of Texas. This was problematic, as the Federal government did not then \\"own\\" that territory and therefore could not reserve it: the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States in 1849, but the Republic did not recognize any native land claims within its borders ‚Äî this opinion was based on a faulty reading of Spanish and Mexican law and therefore in 1865 there were no \\"federal\\" versus \\"state\\" owned lands within the boundaries of Texas which the Government could \\"reserve\\" to the Native Americans. = Medicine Lodge Treaty = Two years later, at the October 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty Conference, Ten Bears and other Yamparikas as well as a few other Comanches (but none of the newly emergent Kwahada division, who were delayed by sickness), agreed to a smaller reservation in western Indian territory of Oklahoma. At that conference, Ten Bears gave an eloquent address:  Death  A year later in December 1868, a number of Yamparika local bands, including Ten Bear's, were along the Washita River in western Indian Territory, near their allied Cheyennes and within the boundaries of the latter's reservation. When troops under Lt. Col George Armstrong Custer attacked the Cheyenne village under Black Kettle, Yamparika warriors from the village of Esarosavit 'White Wolf' joined in the counter attack, and \\"rode over\\" the detachment of Major Joel Elliot. In 1872, Ten Bears again visited Washington, along with a delegation that included his grandson Cheevers (probably from the Spanish chiva 'goat', although Attocknie argues that it was tsii putsi 'little pitied one'), as well as other Comanches and Kiowas. But the hope that promises would be kept was ultimately futile. Ten Bears died soon after his return, November 23, 1872, at Fort Sill where he is buried. Sources * Wallace, Ernest & Hoebel, E.

He enjoyed a lengthy career, playing primarily as a defensive midfielder for Italian clubs Torino, Saviglianese, Fiorentina, Sampdoria, and Piacenza. Due to his tactical intelligence, passing, stamina, tenacity, and versatility, he was capable of playing in several midfield and defensive positions. At international level, he represented Italy on three occasions between 1998 and 1999, and was member of the team that took part at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Cois was born in Fossano. He played for several clubs throughout his career, including Torino (1988‚Äì1994), Sampdoria (2002‚Äì03) and Piacenza (2003). He achieved notable success with Torino early in his career, after achieving Serie A promotion by winning the 1989‚Äì90 Serie B title with the club. He later won the Mitropa Cup in 1991, the Coppa Italia in 1993, and he helped his team to the 1991‚Äì92 UEFA Cup final, after helping his team to qualify for the tournament by leading them to a third place in Serie A in 1991. In the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, they were defeated by Ajax on aggregate. Cois is perhaps best known for his spell at Fiorentina (1994‚Äì2002) in the mid- late 90s where he won over the fans with his tireless running and tenacious play, becoming important to the side as the less glamorous foil to playmakers like Rui Costa and Domenico Morfeo. With the club he won two Coppa Italia trophies in 1996 and 2001, and a Supercoppa Italiana in 1996, also helping Fiorentina to two third-place finishes in Serie A in 1996 and 1999. International career It was during his period with Fiorentina in the late 90s that Cois broke into the Italy national football team. He was a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, although he never became a regular in the side, winning just 3 caps between 1998 and 1999, one of which was in an unofficial match against the FIFA World Stars, also failing to make an appearance at the 1998 World Cup.1998 FIFA World Cup: Italy Squad FIFA.

Geography =Location= Erlenbach lies in Lower Franconia in Bavaria's northwest, at the Mainviereck (‚ÄúMain Square‚Äù), near Aschaffenburg. =Constituent communities= The formerly self-administering neighbouring communities of Mechenhard and Streit were amalgamated with Erlenbach in 1976 and 1978, respectively. History The local area has been inhabited at least since the late Bronze Age, based on archaeological findings. In 1876, four barrows from the Bronze Age (roughly 1550‚Äì1250 BC) were discovered. In 1981, two typical Urnfield culture graves from the time about 1000‚Äì800 BC were found. In the 1st century AD, the Roman Empire reached all the way to the Main. This watery stretch of the Limes Germanicus was enforced with castra. To avoid the Romans, the Germanic peoples moved their settlements to the other side of the Main, the east side, or right bank. After the Roman Empire fell, it took many years for the Franks to move into the Main region in 531 and found settlements of their own. The first farms in Erlenbach were likely only built sometime between 800 and 950. About 1183, Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa granted Erlenbach market rights. The Imperial award was given visible expression with a market and freedom sign. It shows a large cross on whose top stands a cock. On the crossbeam a hand rises up on one side and on the other a sword. The upheld hand made clear that the Erlenbach dwellers stood under the Emperor's special protection, and that any who set himself against it would have to reckon with the sovereign's upraised sword. Demographics =Religion= Besides the Catholic churches Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's, Saint Joseph‚Äôs (main town), Saint Joseph‚Äôs (outlying centre of Mechenhard) and Saint Charles Borromeo‚Äôs there is also the Evangelical Martin Luther Church. Since January 2007 there has also been the Evangelical Free Church Erlenbach Congregation, which in April 2009 counted 61 members. Economy Since 1918, Erlenbach has been the site of a shipyard that as of 2003 was \\"one of the largest inland vessel yards\\" in Europe. Governance =Town council= The council is made up of 24 council members, with seats apportioned thus: * CSU 11 * SPD 7 * B√ºndnis 90/Die Gr√ºnen 2 * Freie W√§hler 4 =Mayors= The Mayor is Michael Berninger (CSU), and the deputies are Anne Tulke (SPD) and Wolfgang Gro√ümann (Freie W√§hler). =Town twinning= * Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne, France * Erlenbach, Canton of Z√ºrich, Switzerland * Erlenbach im Simmental, Canton of Bern, Switzerland =Coat of arms= The town's arms might be described thus: Or an eagle with two heads displayed sable crowned on each head gules with studs of the field, armed and beaked of the field holding in his talon dexter an orb of the third banded and ensigned with a cross of the field and in his talon sinister a sword of the third, in chief an Elector's crown proper. This coat of arms, newly conferred upon the market community of Erlenbach am Main in 1953 is based on two seals known to have been borne by the Erlenbach court in the time from 1722 to 1810 and whose images matched each other. Both seals showed a crowned two-headed eagle holding a monarch's orb in the right talon and a sword in the left. Floating above the eagle's heads was an Elector's crown, and underneath their heads were the letters E and B (Erlenbach). Culture and sightseeing The renovated Frankenhalle offers theatre, musicals and concerts. The Kino-Passage cinema has operated since 1979 as a repertory cinema. There are also many festivals and markets. Winegrowing is only confirmed as a local practice by a document from 2 January 1261. Since 1990, Erlenbach has been located on the Fr√§nkischer Rotwein Wanderweg (\\"Franconian Red Wine Hiking Trail\\"), a along-distance hiking path. Sports The town's association football club SV Erlenbach, formed in 1919, experienced its greatest success in 2013 when it won promotion to the Bayernliga for the first time.

The first lodge (St. Olai Lodge - Later changed to Lodge St. Olaus to the white Leopard) was opened in 1749 and is still working. The Grand Lodge has followed the Swedish Rite since 1818, which requires its members to adhere to Christianity. During the union of Sweden- Norway, the Swedish-Norwegian king was Grand Master of the Order. The sovereign Grand Lodge of Norway was consecrated in 1891. As of 2009, the Order has about 20,000 members. The Order consists of 63 lodges of St. John (I¬∫ - III¬∫), 19 lodges of St. Andrew (IV¬∫ - VI¬∫), three Steward lodges of 2. order (VII ¬∫), four Steward lodges of 1. order (VII¬∫ - VIII¬∫), three Provincial lodges (VII¬∫ - X¬∫), the Grand lodge (VII¬∫ - XII¬∫) and one research lodge. The order is headquartered in Oslo, with a large building next to the Norwegian Parliament. Founding lodges of the order =Lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard= Lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard (Danish:Norway and Denmark formed a union when the lodge was established, and its old name has been preserved St. Olaus til den hvide leopard) was established on June 24, 1749 on the island of Ladegaard, in the building of Bygd√∏y Kongsgaard in Christiania. The original name of the lodge was St. Olai, and it was named after the Norwegian king Olaf the Holy one (Olai is a Latin genitive form of Olav).St. Magnus, Medlemsblad for St. Johanneslogen St. Magnus, Loge nr. 12 under Den Norske Frimurerorden, Enogttyvende √•rgang. Nummer 2 - 2008, Broder Taler i St. Magnus, Einar B√∏e: ¬´Helgennavn som Logenavn¬ª In 1780 the lodge changed its name to Saint Olaus to the white leopard. In 1785, the second City Hall of Christiana (built 1733) was bought by St. Olai Lodge. The inauguration of the lodge rooms was carried out by Bernt Anker, and the lodge had its residence in the ground floor and the first floor until 1811. Today, the lodge resides inside the headquarters of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons in Nedre Vollgt. 19, Oslo, as a neighbour building of the Norwegian Storting. The coat of arms of the Lodge carries the Latin inscription Artis Ope Ferociam Exuit, meaning \\"With the help of the Art, it (the leopard) shall get rid of its wildness (or rage).\\" St. Olai Lodge was the first Masonic lodge in Norway, and the mother lodge of many lodges in the Norwegian Order of Freemasons. It was founded by Count Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig, probably with the Danish king Frederick V of Denmark present at the initiation ceremony. The lodge is an offshoot of the Danish lodge St. Martin which existed in Copenhagen from 1743 to 1767. Nationality The lodge received its directives from Danish Freemasonic lodges from 1749 to 1818. Its first mother lodge was ¬´St. Martin¬ª, founded in Copenhagen in 1743. In 1745, the lodge ¬´Zorobabel¬ª, also in Copenhagen, was founded as an offshoot of ¬´St. Martin¬ª, with a Patent from the Premier Grand Lodge of England dated 25 October 1745. The two lodges ¬´St. Martin¬ª and ¬´Zorobabel¬ª was unified into the new lodge ¬´Zorobabel to the Northern Star¬ª on 9 January 1767, upon which the new lodge became the new directing lodge of St. Olaus. In 1818, due to the union between Norway and Sweden, the lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard became a member of The Swedish Order of Freemasons. The lodge was one of the six founding members of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons (¬´Province X¬ª) on 24 June 1891. Rites On its foundations in 1749, St Olaus was a pure lodge of St. John, a ¬´blue lodge¬ª practising the Craft degrees. In 1752 the lodge also gradually began to practise the high degrees of Rite of Strict Observance. The establishment of the rites was finished in 1762 and was practised in cooperation with the Copenhagen-lodges until 1782. The rectified rite was introduced in Denmark and Norway in 1782. It was influenced by French Freemasonry and was less concerned with Christian institutions. Among other things, it removed the legend about the Knights Templars from the teachings. In 1818, St. Olaus became directed from the Swedish Grand lodge, and in 1819 it was transformed into a ¬´blue lodge¬ª of St. John practising the three Craft degrees since then. =St. Andrew lodge Oscar to the burning star= Coat of arms of Lodge Oscar til den flammende Stjerne The St. Andrew lodge Oscar to the burning star (Norwegian: Oscar til den flammende Stjerne) sometimes known as Lodge of St. Andrew no. 1, was founded in Drammen in 1826 as a Craft lodge, practising the three degrees of St. John. After having delivered an application to the Swedish Grand Lodge, it was moved to Christiana and elevated to a St. Andrew lodge practising the Scottish degrees of St. Andrew (IV¬∞-VI¬∞) of the Swedish Rite. The Act of capitulation as a lodge of St. John was formulated on 10 April 1836. Its constituting patent as a lodge of St. Andrew was then worked out on 10 April 1841.

She was built for businessman William Lawrence Stephenson and between 1933 and 1936, she won many races and competed with other yachts of her era such as Britannia, Endeavour and Shamrock V. History =Initial career= Designed by Charles Ernest Nicholson and built by Camper & Nicholsons in 1933 for Mr W.L. Stephenson, managing director of Woolworth retail shops, she was built in 1933 at Gosport. She was Nicholson's second design for a J Class and Stephenson's second big yacht. Velsheda was named after Stephenson's three daughters, Velma, Sheila and Daphne. She raced with the greatest names in classic yachting including Britannia, Endeavour and Shamrock V between 1933 and 1936. In her second season she won more than 40 races and achieved an outstanding record of success at regattas from Southend to Dartmouth. Other venues included Torbay, Swanage and of course the Solent, all under the control of the very famous Captain Fred Mountifield. The permanent racing crew at that time was probably around 16 men and this would have been augmented to around 30 for racing. When not required for sail changes, spare crew were moved to below decks. In her 1930s heyday, she represented the most advanced technical design for spars, rigging, sails, deck gear and ropes. Her masts were aluminium, made by bending plates and riveting them together.J Class Yachts Sails were made from the new Terylene threads and deck gear now included winches for easier handling of sheets. The standing rigging was solid rod, even in the 1930s, but with so much stretch in the rigging and systems it was inevitable that J Class masts could not be held in column and would collapse in stronger winds. In anything above a force 3, there was serious concern about holding the rig in place without collapse. Below decks accommodation was limited to just the main saloon, owners quarters aft, and storage for sails and equipment forward. By 1937 she was laid up in a mud berth on the River Hamble and became derelict. Many sailors remember visiting her - one recalls sailing in the annual Warming Pan race at Hamble, and all the visiting crew being taken up the river to their overnight accommodation on Velsheda. =Subsequent restoration= Velsheda in 1996 Velsheda was rescued from her Hamble mud berth in 1984 by Terry Brabant, who economically refitted her for charter work with a new steel mast and limited interior. Still without an engine she sailed regularly along the UK south coast on charter work and occasionally ventured to the Mediterranean and Caribbean. She had a chequered career: whilst on charter during the early 1990s Velsheda visited the UK east coast where she found herself on the beach on a falling tide, fortunately she was recovered safely. Occasionally she raced in the annual Round the Island Race and although in poor condition, she was still an impressive sight, competing the 60 mile course in quick time. She was laid up and moored at Gosport in 1995/6. She was purchased in 1996 as a bare hull from the bankrupt C & N yard in Portsmouth Harbour. Southampton Yacht Services on the River Itchen were then commissioned to undertake a major rebuild including a new one piece carbon fibre mast and inboard diesel engine installation for the first time. She was re-launched in November 1997.. J Class Yachts. Retrieved on 2011-05-07. Dutch businessman Ronald de Waal (from European retail fashion chain WE, formerly HIJ/HEY/ZIJ) bought Velsheda in 1999 and has campaigned her extensively in the Maxi and classic racing circuits in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean sea.

It is a Grade II listed building. The Opera House is one of the main theatres in Manchester, England. The Opera House and its sister theatre the Palace Theatre, Manchester on Oxford Street are operated by the same parent company, Ambassador Theatre Group. History The theatre opened as the New Theatre in 1912, renamed the New Queen‚Äôs Theatre in 1915 and as the Opera House in 1920 when it came under the wing of John Hart and his associates of United Theatres Ltd. In 1931 it was bought by, and prospered under, Howard & Wyndham LtdThe Stage, 30 August 1931 which had been formed at the Theatre Royal, GlasgowThe Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation, by Graeme Smith, published 2008 in 1895 by Michael SimonsTheatre Royal, Glasgow. The group\`s managing director A Stewart Cruikshank, headquartered at the group's headquarters in the King's Theatre, Edinburgh was joined on the board by Charles B Cochrane who now became a visiting producer at the Opera House, premiering numerous musicals and revues. The theatre staged the full range of plays, musicals, opera, and pantomime. It closed in 1979 and for five years was a bingo hall. The Palace Trust acquired it in 1984 and returned it to a theatre. In 1990 it was acquired by Apollo Leisure and staged large-scale musicals. Architecture Opera House, Manchester The theatre has a rectangular plan and is built of stuccoed brick with a slate roof. Its symmetrical fifteen-bay facade is in the Classical style with a five-bay centre with fluted Ionic columns. Above the three central bays is a relief of a horse-drawn chariot within a semi-circular arch. The gable has a moulded cornice on brackets. The entrance canopy is a 20th-century addition. The auditorium has two curved cantilevered balconies with large overhangs each holding 500 seats. Either side of the stage are stacked boxes between pairs of fluted Corinthian columns. The high proscenium arch is decorated with a circular medallion flanked by gryphons. The high ceiling above the auditorium takes the form of a coffered segmental tunnel vault. The stage is 42 feet deep and 37 feet wide. The orchestra pit holds 80 musicians. The theatre has 1,920 seats. The theatre was redecorated in March 2011 keeping the green and gold colour scheme of the auditorium unchanged. Productions The Opera House hosted the 1958 European premiere of West Side Story and the British regional premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera with a production that opened in 1993 and ran to 1995, an exceptional run for a regional production. The Opera House was the venue for a stage show, Gorillaz' Demon Days Live. Manchester Opera House also saw the premiere of Never Forget, the Take That musical. The cast included Tim Driesen, who played the role of Adrian Banks/Mark Owen. The musical has had both of its UK tours premiere at the Manchester Opera House. The world premiere of Ghost the Musical was held at the theatre from March‚ÄìMay 2011 before it transferred to London's West End. The UK premiere of the Dolly Parton musical 9 to 5 began its UK tour at the theatre on 12 October 2012. Other productions to receive their world premiere at the Opera House include Bat Out of Hell which premiered in February 2017, & Juliet, which received its world premiere in September 2019, and most recently Back to the Future, premiering in February 2020.

Throughout his career, he played for several Italian clubs: Lecce, Cagliari, Roma, Inter Milan, and Napoli, winning an UEFA Cup title with Inter in 1998. A former Italy international, he took part at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Francesco Moriero played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, including Lecce (1986‚Äì1992), Cagliari (1992‚Äì94), Roma (1994‚Äì97), Inter Milan (1997‚Äì2000), and Napoli (2000‚Äì2002). Originally from Lecce, he began his career with the local club's youth side, making his professional debut with the senior Lecce side during the 1986‚Äì87 Serie B season. The following season, he made 35 appearances, scoring 3 goals, helping the team to gain promotion to Serie A. He played two seasons in Serie A with Lecce, making 86 appearances and scoring 4 goals, before Lecce were relegated to Serie B once again. During the 1991‚Äì92 Serie B season, he set a personal best of 6 goals in 34 appearances, before moving to Cagliari in 1992, where he made his debut in European competitions, notably helping the team to reach the semi-final of the 1993‚Äì94 UEFA Cup. In 1994, he moved to Roma for 8.5 billion Lit. He spent 3 seasons with the club, becoming an important figure, making 75 appearances in Serie A, and scoring 8 goals. In May 1997, he had initially made a deal to sign for Milan, but in July, he signed with Inter for 1 million Lit. in an exchange between the two Milan clubs involving Andr√© Cruz, who was initially about to sign a contract with Inter. He made his debut with Inter on the first matchday of the 1997‚Äì98 Serie A season, on 31 August 1997, against Brescia, at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium. His most notable and successful career spell came with the Milan club, and in his first season, he won the 1997‚Äì98 UEFA Cup under manager Luigi Simoni, notably scoring a goal from a bicycle kick against the Swiss team Neuchatel Xamax during the tournament. Inter also narrowly missed out on the Serie A title to Juventus that season, as Moriero made 28 league appearances that season, scoring 3 goals. Although he made fewer appearances during the next two seasons due to injury (making 28 appearances in Serie A in total, scoring 3 goals), he also later reached the 2000 Coppa Italia final with the club, under Marcello Lippi, before moving to Napoli in 2000. During the 2000‚Äì01 Serie A season, he made 14 appearances with Napoli, scoring a goal, although he was unable to save the club from relegation. He ended his career with the club in 2002, in Serie B. In total he made 287 appearances in Serie A, scoring 21 goals. International career After making an appearance with the Italy national under-21 football team in a 1‚Äì0 win over Greece on 7 February 1990, under manager Cesare Maldini, Moriero also played for the senior Italian national team; in total, he scored two goals in eight matches for Italy between 1998 and 1999. He made his senior international debut on 28 January 1998, in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Slovakia, providing two assists during the match; in his next appearance, in an international friendly against Paraguay on 22 April 1998, he scored his only two goals for Italy, one from a bicycle kick, as they won the match 3‚Äì1 at home. Moriero was a participant for Italy at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, under Cesare Maldini once again, where Italy were eliminated in the quarterfinals to hosts and eventual champions France on penalties. Although he was often alternated with the more defensive-minded Angelo Di Livio on the right wing, he still appeared in all five of Italy's matches during the tournament, and he assisted Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 3‚Äì0 win against Cameroon in their second group stage match, also starting the play for his second goal of the match. He also combined with Filippo Inzaghi to initiate the play which led to Roberto Baggio's match winning goal against Austria in Italy's final group match, as Italy won 2‚Äì1 to top their group. He made his final appearance for Italy on 9 October the following year, in a European qualifier against Belarus, under manager Dino Zoff, which ended in a 0‚Äì0 away draw. Coaching career In 2006, soon after having successfully ended his studies at the Coverciano football coaching school, Moriero was appointed head coach of Ivorian club Africa Sports. On 27 July 2007, Africa Sports announced that they have sacked Moriero, appointing his assistant Salvatore Nobile as new boss. On 7 August, Moriero signed for Serie C1's Lanciano, guiding the club under massive financial issues that successively led to bankrupt, an auction- regulated sale and point deductions throughout the season. He successively guided F.C. Crotone to win the Lega Pro Prima Divisione playoffs and achieve promotion to Serie B in the 2008‚Äì09 season. He then served as head coach of Serie B club Frosinone from July 2009 to April 2010. In September 2010 he was named new head coach of Grosseto in the Italian Serie B, replacing Luigi Apolloni, but was dismissed later in January 2011 due to poor results. In the season 2012‚Äì13 he was again named head coach of Grosseto, but on 1 October 2012 he was sacked. On 30 June 2013, Moriero signed with his former club, Lecce, although he was dismissed 24 September. On 1 July 2014, he was hired by Catanzaro, although he was later sacked once again by the club on 9 November. In May 2017 he was appointed coach of Sambenedettese. He was fired in November, but was later called back in April 2018.Il presidente della Sambenedettese annuncia: ‚ÄúAbbiamo esonerato Moriero‚Äù‚Äö alfredopedulla.com, 8 November 2017Serie C Sambenedettese, ufficiale: ritorna Moriero He left the club again on 30 June 2018. In June 2019 he joined Cavese, but was fired in September after 4 Serie C matches without wins. Style of play Moriero was a right-footed, quick, diminutive, energetic, and highly technical midfielder, who was predominantly used as right winger; although he was primarily an offensive minded player, with a penchant for making attacking runs, and who was even used as an outside forward on occasion, he was also known for his work-rate, tactical intelligence, and defensive contribution off the ball, as well as his ability to track back, which enabled him to cover the flank effectively. Moriero's main attributes were his acceleration, pace, dribbling skills, agility, flair, and creativity; these characteristics enabled him to beat opponents in one on one situations, get up the wing, and provide width to his team by overloading the flanks, giving his team a numerical advantage when attacking. He was also known for his ability to create chances and provide assists for strikers with his crossing ability and long balls from the right flank. He also had good vision and distribution, as well as a penchant for scoring with spectacular strikes from distance, or acrobatic goals from volleys and bicycle kicks. Regarded as one of the best wingers of his generation, during his prime, his world class performances, characteristics, playing style, and position on the pitch earned him comparisons with esteemed former Italian wingers Franco Causio, Bruno Conti, and Roberto Donadoni, as well as Portuguese winger Lu√≠s Figo. However, despite his talent, Moriero also garnered a reputation for being inconsistent at times. In addition to his skills and playing ability, Moriero was also known for his trademark celebration, which involved him pretending to polish his team-mates' football boots whenever they scored a goal.

From 1974 to 1979 he was principal of the University College of Buckingham, now the University of Buckingham.Johnson, Nevil. \\"Obituary of Lord Beloff,\\" The Independent, 26 March 1999.David Walker, \\"Unrelenting Foe of Academic Marxism\\", The Times', 8 November 1988. Early life Beloff was born on 2 July 1913 at 21 York House, Fieldway Crescent, Islington, London and was the oldest child of a Jewish family who had moved to England in 1903 from Russia.The Times, 24 March 1999, p23 He was the elder son in a family of five children of merchant Semion (Simon) Beloff (born Semion Rubinowicz) and his wife Maria (Marie) Katzin. His sister Anne later married German-born Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning biochemist Ernst Boris Chain in 1948. His sister Renee Soskin was a politician and educationalist. His other sister Nora Beloff was a journalist and political correspondent. His brother was the psychologist John Beloff. The young Beloff was educated at St Paul's School, and then studied Modern History at Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he graduated with first-class honours. (Scholar; MA; Honorary Fellow, 1993). The Beloff family's lineage to the House of David as descendants of Rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogen, the Maharam of Padua, is detailed in The Unbroken Chain.Rosenstein, Neil. \\"The Unbroken Chain: Biographical Sketches and Genealogy of Illustrious Jewish Families from the 15th‚Äì20th Century,\\" Volumes 1 and 2, Revised Edition, CIS Publishers: New York, 1990. . Politics In his 1992 autobiographical work A Historian in the Twentieth Century Beloff discusses his political journey. He had been at school a conservative, was then attracted to socialism once at university and became a liberal after the Second World War. In 1962, during public debate of the case for a referendum on whether to join the European Economic Community, he argued that a referendum is not meaningful unless clear alternatives are set before the electorate; in the absence of such clarity, \\"the electorate would... be doing no more than indicating a very general bias one way or another\\" ('\\"The Case against a ReferendumÀÆ\\", The Observer, 21 October 1962, p. 11). In the debate about educational standards in the 1960s, he found the Labour government hostile to his idea of a university outside the state- financed framework and felt the Liberal Party was \\"moving increasingly to the left\\". That inclined him to join the Conservative Party upon his retirement in 1979. He received a knighthood in 1980, and on 26 May 1981 he was created a life peer, taking the title Baron Beloff, of Wolvercote in the County of Oxfordshire. He spoke often on educational and constitutional matters in the House of Lords and, outside of the chamber, continued to write. He was a strong Eurosceptic and argued that Britain's history made it incompatible with membership of the European Union, which led to him writing Britain and European Union: Dialogue of the Deaf, published in 1996.Britain and European Union: Dialogue of the Deaf, Lord Beloff, Macmillan, 1996 In 1990 Lord Beloff was one of the leading historians behind the setting up of the History Curriculum Association. The Association advocated a more knowledge-based history curriculum in schools. It expressed \\"profound disquiet\\" at the way history was being taught in the classroom and observed that the integrity of history was threatened. Daily Telegraph 19th March 1990 and https://www.cre.org.uk/docs/CRE-GCSE-History-An-Alternative-Approach.pdf In a House of Lords debate on 21st July 1989 he supported the two Lewes teachers, Chris McGovern and Dr Anthony Freeman who suffered redeployment following their criticism of the academic quality of the what was then the new GCSE examination. https://api.parliament.uk/historic- hansard/lords/1989/jul/21/teacher-redeployment-east-sussex He was a strong opponent of New Labour's House of Lords Bill and gave many speeches in the chamber defending the hereditary principle; however, he died before the bill was passed. He gave his final speech in the House of Lords on 22 March 1999, the day he died.

He also played club cricket in the Lancashire League, Huddersfield League and the Birmingham League. Alleyne was born at Derricks, St James in 1957. Career Alleyne made his List A debut on 20 March 1979 in a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy match against the Leeward Islands, claiming the wicket of Test cricketer Derick Parry. Three days later he made his first-class debut against Combined Islands in the Shell Shield, picking up a wicket in each innings. He made no further first-class appearances that season, but did play two more Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy games. Alleyne had played one Minor Counties Championship match in England in 1979, for Lincolnshire against Norfolk, and in 1980 he began to play county cricket for Worcestershire, where he remained for three seasons. He had a fine 1980, capturing 64 first-class wickets at 25.06 and 31 List A wickets at 18.12, as well as scoring what was to be his only first-class half-century -- 72 against Lancashire in the only first-class match ever played at Stourport-on-Severn. It was thus little surprise when he was awarded his county cap in 1981, in which year he took a career-best 8-43 against Middlesex. However, in general he failed to reach the same standards as in 1980, and he left the county after the 1982 season. For the next couple of years, Alleyne divided his time between Barbados and Haslingden in the Lancashire League, as well as traveling with a West Indies XI for a non-Test tour of India. He was banned from international cricket after he joined the rebel tour to South Africa in 1983-84, defying the international sporting boycott of the apartheid state. He also played for Buckinghamshire in 1984 and 1985. In 1984-85 he joined Natal, for whom he took 56 first-class and 65 List A wickets in his six seasons in South Africa. His second stint in county cricket, with Kent, came in 1988 and 1989, and although he played only nine first-class matches for the county (taking 21 wickets) he did appear 16 times in the one-day game (taking 22). His final first-class outing was for Natal in the Currie Cup against Western Province in October 1989. After that, he played on in the Lancashire League for a couple of seasons, this time for the Colne club. He then became a cricket coach at first Birkenhead Boys School on the Wirral between 2003 and 2006 then St. Edmund's School in Canterbury, Kent, but in 2007 was refused a work permit by the Home Office and threatened with deportation despite having obtained the requested NVQ level 3 in sports coaching. His local MP, Julian Brazier, called the decision \\"utter madness\\". However, in January 2008 Alleyne was granted leave to remain in the UK for three years, and said that it felt \\"like winning the Lotto\\".

Built by the Earl of Moira in 1804, the building has been preserved by North West Leicestershire District Council as a museum featuring lime kilns and craft workshops. It is a most important industrial monument, since it is remarkably well-preserved, and dates from a formative period of the Industrial Revolution.Cranstone, D., ed. (1985) The Moira Furnace: A Napoleonic Blast Furnace in Leicestershire Coalville: North West Leicestershire District Council Description Moira Furnace was a coke- fuelled, steam-engine blown blast furnace for the smelting of iron from local iron ore, with an attached foundry for the manufacture of cast-iron goods. The preserved furnace consists of the blast furnace, the attached bridgehouse, and the loading ramp. The blast furnace is the vertical structure with the blank arches at the lowest part of the site. The furnace within was supplied with raw materials (iron ore, coke, and limestone) by tipping them in through a charging port at the top, accessed from the bridgeloft. The loading ramp, which spans the Ashby Canal, allowed the raw materials to be raised into the bridgeloft, which comprises the top floor of the bridgehouse, the large building with the pitched roof behind the furnace. In the bridgeloft the materials were probably weighed and, maybe, mixed before being charged into the furnace. When the furnace was fired the steam engine blower, now gone, forced a continuous blast of air into the bottom of the furnace in order to make the coke burn brighter and raise the temperature inside high enough to melt the iron (1,538 ¬∞C, 2,800 ¬∞F). The hot gases exhausted from the low chimney at the top of the furnace. When ready, the molten iron was tapped from the bottom of the furnace and run into moulds to produce pig iron. Moira Furnace is one of the few remaining blast furnaces from this period of innovation - because it was a commercial failure. Had it been successful then it is highly likely that over time the site would have developed and the first furnace replaced. History Ashby de la Zouch Canal in 1982, before restoration In 1804, the Earl of Moira had the furnace constructed to take advantage of the iron ore and abundant coal which were present underground in the surrounding Ashby Woulds area owned by him. The location was chosen for its proximity to the Ashby Canal for transport, and the lie of the land which allowed the furnace to be built low down so the raw materials did not need raising very high. However, this was a period of development in blast furnace design and some of the features of Moira Furnace do not appear to have been successful. It was brought into blast in 1806, and used intermittently until 1811, though the foundry remained in use until after 1844 by utilising iron brought in from elsewhere. The historical evidence shows that, although saleable iron was at times produced, over the period that the furnace operated it experienced continual problems. Documents mention bad design, bad construction, bad raw materials, and bad management, but many of the documents were written by individuals trying to divert the blame from themselves. The furnace was abandoned with its final charge still inside, partially smelted. Metallurgical examination has shown a high sulphur content in the raw materials, which may have been a contributory factor, and the chimney shows signs of severe overheating, indicating a design fault or operating problem. The attached foundry continued to be used for some years, using brought-in pig iron, though it was demolished later in the 19th century. Meanwhile the bridgehouse and the engine house, which was a separate building to the side of the furnace, were converted to dwellings and survived. However, by the 1970s they had become derelict and affected by mining subsidence and the engine house was demolished. After pressure by Philip Riden and from Leicestershire Industrial History Society, the furnace and bridgehouse were scheduled as an ancient monument. The site was acquired by North West Leicestershire District Council in 1981, who sponsored a Community Programme to restore the site and develop it as a museum and country park. Inside the bridgehouse there is now a museum, operated by the Moira Furnace Museum Trust, which is open regularly. It has information boards and displays about Moira Furnace and the industrial heritage of the area. The furnace has become a popular site for the detection of paranormal activity by Swadlincote Paranormal Investigations, who first visited the furnace with Richard Felix and Phil Whyman. They hold nocturnal events here, which are open to the public.

The squadron is based at Luscombe Airfield, Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney and forms part of the 6th Aviation Regiment. Overview The Squadron primarily supports the Tactical Assault Group, troop lift support is also provided to other Special Forces based at Holsworthy and Perth, and to other east coast and southern Australian based units. In March 1997, the Board of Inquiry into the Black Hawk Training Accident in June 1996 recommended that dedicated Army aviation assets be allocated in support of the counter terrorist and special operations capability and that the units be colocated during training, planning and the conduct of operations. History The 171st Aviation Squadron traces its lineage back to the 161st Reconnaissance Flight which was formed in June 1965 based at RAAF Base Amberley. The Flight was part of the 16th Army Light Aircraft Squadron which in 1967 became the 1st Aviation Regiment. The Flight served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1971 and during this period was renamed the 161st (Independent) Reconnaissance Flight. On return from Vietnam, the Flight was based at Oakey. On 31 January 1974, the Flight was re-designated as the \\"171st Operational Support Squadron\\" following a restructure of the 1st Aviation Regiment using the number from the disbanded 171st Air Cavalry Flight. On 19 December 2002, the Prime Minister announced the creation of the Special Operations Command and that the government would accelerate the purchase of the MRH-90 Taipan helicopters to enable a squadron of helicopters to be based in Sydney as a potent addition to the Tactical Assault Group East. On 28 November 2004, 'A' Squadron of the 5th Aviation Regiment based at RAAF Base Townsville swapped designations with the 171st Operational Support Squadron. The Squadron was equipped with the Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk with the role of providing support to the Special Operations Command. The Squadron separated from the 1st Aviation Regiment and was placed under the command of the 16th Aviation Brigade as an independent squadron and was re-designated as the \\"171st Aviation Squadron\\". The Squadron was commanded by a lieutenant colonel in addition to the conventional squadron commander of Major rank. In July 2005, Holsworthy Barracks was selected as the location in Sydney to relocate the Squadron. In December 2006, the Squadron relocated to temporary facilities at Luscombe Airfield with the redevelopment of the airfield expected to be completed by late 2008. The Squadron was involved in operations in East Timor as part of Operation Astute. On 29 November 2006, a Squadron Black Hawk helicopter crashed during Operation Quickstep while attached to HMAS Kanimbla off the coast of Fiji. The helicopter's pilot, Captain Mark Bingley, and Trooper Joshua Porter from the Special Air Service Regiment were killed in the crash. In March 2008, the Squadron became part of the newly raised 6th Aviation Regiment following implementation of a recommendation from the Board of Inquiry into the Crash of Black Hawk 221 to raise a regiment. Current aircraft A Commando from 1st Commando Regiment jumping from a 171 Avn Sqn Black Hawk in 2013 The squadron is equipped with S-70A-9 Black Hawks and was planned to transition to the MRH 90 Taipan, an Australian variant of the NHI NH90, with the withdrawal of the Black Hawk from service by December 2013. However, the MRH 90 Program encountered significant problems, and in particular, the NH90 had not been operated in a dedicated special operations role, delaying the withdrawal. The Chief of Army extended the service of 20 Black Hawks to 2022 with 18 based at Holsworthy and two retained at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in Queensland. The MRH 90 will be introduced into the 6th Aviation Regiment in 2019 under Plan Palisade which will require the development of a fast roping, rappelling and extraction system (FFRES), gun mount capable of firing the FN MAG58 machine gun and M134D minigun, and new cargo hook.

It is part of the historical and geographical region of Polesine. It is the birthplace of Domenico Montagnana (1680-1750), one of the world's finest violin and cello makers. Tenor Domenico Ronconi was also born in the town. In the latter part of the 19th century, it was the home of Jessie White Mario, the English woman who took an active part in the struggle for the Unification of Italy at the side of Mazzini and Garibaldi. Outside of the town stands the Sanctuary of Nostra Signora del Pilastrello (Our Lady of the Pilaster), at the site of a shrine built in the 16th century to house an icon of the Madonna. The abbey and church were reconstructed in the 19th century.History of the Sanctuary Jessie White's house in Lendinara.  Geography  = Territory = Lendinara is located in the north-east of the Italian peninsula, in the middle western part of Polesine province and it's crossed by the Adigetto river, that divides it in two. Lendinara is 16 km far from the provincial capital Rovigo.

This is a temperate climate with hot and sometimes muggy summers and cold, wet winters. Precipitation is concentrated in the spring and autumn seasons.  History  = Antiquity = Numerous archaeological finds such as cinerary urns, tombstones, coins, glass and even traces of road and hydraulic works, show that a primitive center already existed in Roman times. Perhaps there were older settlements since some findings seem to derive their origin from the Middle East. = Middle Ages = The first historical document about Lendinara dates back to 870, when Uberto Cattaneo, from Verona, obtained from the Carolings the lordship over the town, a lordship that lasted for more than four centuries. Already in the XI century Lendinara was \\"illustrious Castle, enriched with many factories and towers, cultured population\\", as the Muratori called it. The castle was located to the left of the Adigetto canal and was surrounded by fortifications that contained a large part of the town. Outside the walls, however, there was the church of Santa Sofia and the convent of San Biagio around which various districts were forming. Lendinara was located in the middle of a very fertile territory and its rivers, Adige and Adigetto, fostered communications. The development was continuous and rapid with the construction of churches and villas and the presence of notaries, city families, and a developed municipal organization. From 1225 Lendinara had a Podesta and from 1321 it was given the first statute in the Polesine region. The city was destroyed by Ezzelino da Romano in 1246 because of the friendship of its inhabitants (Lendinaresi) with San Bonifacio. After this fire, a new city nucleus arose around the convent of the Franciscans, called 'San Marco'. The convent was suppressed in 1810, like the Abbey of Vangadizza di Badia Polesine. Around 1275, for a short period, the city became a republic. The Paduan bought the city in 1283 and then sold it to the Estensi. In this period the \\"Granarone‚Äù, a large store of provisions, was built. The castle had a five-story tower, and a pit that surrounded the whole town, only a wooden bridge connected the center with the fortress. Four doors regulated access to the city. The fifteenth century was the golden age for culture for Lendinara, after being sold to the Venetians. The great school of the wood artisans Canozio was also born, among which excelled Lorenzo Canozio(1426-1477), author of works of gothic art.

The Hungarian forces were fewer in number, but were victorious over the Ottomans. This unexpected victory was even mentioned by Emperor Rudolf decades after the battle. It was one of the most glorious Hungarian victories in the post-Moh√°cs period. Events In 1588, Pasha Sina of Buda marched with his soldiers against Sziksz√≥, who belonged to royal Hungary and refused to pay taxes to Porta. On October 8, Ottoman soldiers were already in the market town and looting when the border fort's rescue army led by Captain Sigismund R√°k√≥czi from Eger arrived. In contrast to the Turkish army of 11,000, the Hungarian-German army could have been 2,400‚Äì2,500. Despite the superiority, the latter still won. More than two thousand Ottomans and about 400‚Äì500 Hungarians and Germans were dead in the clash. In the wake of this incident, the Habsburg court in Prague suspended the payment of a ‚Äúfair gift‚Äù of 30,000 gold a year, fixed in the Drinapolis peace, in response to which Porta threatened war. Prelude In 1588, Sziksz√≥ already owed 1,000 gold tax, so Sinan Pasha of Buda organized a punitive tax collect campaign. The six thousand cavalry and the same number of infantry were led by Kara Ali Beg, the commander of Feh√©rv√°r, against Putnok and then, after he could not take it, set off in the direction of Sziksz√≥. The battle On the afternoon of October 8, the Pasha arrived under the city and immediately began the siege of the church fortress, which was protected by armed citizens. After two hours of siege, however, he was forced to retreat, because the rescue teams led by Major Sigismund R√°k√≥czi from Eger arrived around 5 o'clock. With 2,000 Hungarian warriors and 500 German warriors. Kara Ali set fire to the church and the houses around it, then retreated to the Hern√°d-Velvet triangle, where he arranged his army. He arranged the riders on the right wing and the Janissaries on the left wing, setting up his four cannons in the middle. R√°k√≥czi's army was led in the middle by Istv√°n Drugeth Homonnai, chief of Zempl√©n, the most famous knight of Upper Hungary, the black shield horsemen attacked the left wing, while the German riflemen collided with the Janissaries. Kara Ali was seriously injured at the very beginning of the battle, so the command was taken over by Mustafa Sz√©cs√©ny, who also fell shortly afterwards. At that time the Janissaries broke through the army of the attacking Hungarian armies, Istv√°n Drugeth was captured, and R√°k√≥czi was already considering retreating, when the Hungarian left wing rushed to the aid of the Germans, and thus managed to repel the Janissaries. The order of war was completely disintegrated, and the struggle against man dragged on into the late night. By this time, the third Turkish chief, Bajazid basa, the leader of the Janissaries, had also fallen. Heling, the captain of the Germans, also fell. By 11, the Turkish armies ran away. The cavalry chased them to Saj√≥, and he also managed to free his Homons. 1,700 Turkish and hundreds of Hungarian and German soldiers died in the battle. Aftermath The common grave where the dead were buried has since been called T√∂r√∂khalom. With this victory, Sigismund R√°k√≥czi became famous, Emperor Rudolf, even decades after the battle, mentioned the brilliant triumph, which was especially valuable because of the difference in the numbers of the two armies.

Presentation A baby with isolated omphalocele, one of the defects included in the pentalogy of Cantrell. There are five characteristic findings in pentalogy of Cantrell: # an abdominal wall defect, #lower sternal defect, #congenital heart malformations, #absence of the diaphragmatic pericardium, #and an anterior diaphragmatic defect. Abdominal wall defects in pentalogy of Cantrell occur above the umbilicus (supraumbilical) and in the midline, and have a wide range of presentations. Diastasis recti, hernias, and omphalocele have all been described in conjunction with the pentalogy. Sternal defects too have a range of presentations, from absence of the xiphoid process to shortened or cleft sternum. If the sternal defect is large enough, the neonate may have ectopia cordis, in which the heart is located outside of the thorax. Many congenital heart malformations have been described in conjunction with pentalogy of Cantrell. The most common is ventricular septal defect, found in 72% of cases. Others include atrial septal defect, cardiac diverticulum, pulmonic stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, dextrocardia, and transposition of the great vessels.  Causes  Most cases of pentalogy of Cantrell are idiopathic (no known cause). However, some cases have been described with a genetic linkage to a locus at Xq25-q26.1. Diagnosis A diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell can often be made before birth (prenatally) sometimes using a fetal ultrasound to detect some of the defects associated with pentalogy of Cantrell. Echocardiography is usually performed to evaluate the extent of the involvement of the heart. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be performed to assess the degree of certain anomalies such as abdominal wall and pericardial defects. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. Treatment The treatment of pentalogy of Cantrell is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Surgical intervention for cardiac, diaphragmatic and other associated defects is necessary. Affected infants will require complex medical care and may require surgical intervention. In most cases, pentalogy of Cantrell is fatal without surgical intervention. However, in some cases, the defects are so severe that the individual dies regardless of the medical or surgical interventions received. The specific treatment strategy will vary from one infant to another based upon various factors, including the size and type of abdominal wall defect, the specific cardiac anomalies that are present, and the particular type of ectopia cordis. Surgical procedures that may be required shortly after birth include repair of an omphalocele. At this time, physicians may also attempt to repair certain other defects including defects of the sternum, diaphragm and the pericardium. In severe cases, some physicians advocate for a staged repair of the defects associated with pentalogy of Cantrell. The initial operation immediately after birth provides separation of the peritoneal and pericardial cavities, coverage of the midline defect and repair of the omphalocele. After appropriate growth of the thoracic cavity and lungs, the second stage consists of the repair of cardiac defects and return of the heart to the chest. Eventually, usually by age 2 or 3, reconstruction of the lower sternum or epigastrium may be necessary. Other treatment of pentalogy of Cantrell is symptomatic and supportive.  Epidemiology  Pentalogy of Cantrell occurs in 1/65,000 to 1/200,000 live births.  History  It was first characterized in 1958. A 2010 study concluded that the 13th-century Christian saint Rose of Viterbo died of complications of Pentalogy of Cantrell.

This group works with lay people and academia to help care for the great history of Scotland's archaeological heritage. Their charitable and philanthropic work serves to enrich the story and deep history of Scotland. The organization is responsible for coordinating a number of archaeology related events, such as Scottish Archaeology Month and Adopt-a-Monument.  History and Background  The organisation began as a branch of the Council for British Archaeology, established in 1944. One of the primary leaders of the movement was Dr. W.D. Simpson. Dr. Simpson wanted to entrust this Scottish group to: help to preserve Scottish heritage, antiquities, relics, and ancient buildings; also to preserve ancient country houses and help them to remain inhabited; and carry out the proper archaeological excavation of castles and abbeys. It was also decreed that the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) should find appropriate resources to address urgent archaeological problems. In order to move this charter forward, the CBA needed to work hand in hand with the government to formulate measures to educate the public regarding the care and preservation of historic monuments. In 1949, the Scottish Regional Group of the CBA outlined their own objectives. These would include: * The advancement of archaeology from the 19th century through prehistoric times * Public education * Preservation of ancient Scottish monuments * Raising awareness of the study of archaeology in Scottish universities * Working collaboratively with other organizations to grow museum activities The original name of the organization was The Council for Scottish Archaeology. The Council for Scottish Archaeology became an independent body in 1988, and was reconstituted as a limited company in 2004. The name Archaeology Scotland was adopted in 2008. Archaeology Scotland is a registered Scottish charity, and is dependent on the subscriptions and donations of supporters, grants from Historic Scotland, and trusts and foundations.  Current Organization and Structure  The organization is currently made up of trustees who answer to an appointed board of directors. This board of directors has oversight led by Eila Macqueen. Under Macqueen's leadership, there is a larger team of project managers, development managers, project officers, heritage training officers, and other assorted staff and administration. Activities Archaeology Scotland provides a variety of relevant services and information, including educational resources and publications. The group co-ordinates a number of initiatives including Scottish Archaeology Month, which takes place every September as part of European Heritage Days. Hundreds of free archaeological and heritage themed events take place all over Scotland, allowing people to view usually unseen artefacts and sites. Archaeology Scotland also organises the annual Archaeological Research in Progress conference in partnership with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. One of the key fundraising awareness and initiatives is the Adopt-a-Monument event. Additionally, the Heritage Hero Awards and their journal \\"Discovery and Excavation in Scotland\\" is the premiere resource for learning more about current Scottish archaeological fieldwork. For more than 20 years, the organization has sponsored Scottish Archaeological Month (SAM) which works to engage people with the heritage and history of Scottish archaeology. Activities include lectures, performances, walking tours, and exhibitions. SAM takes place in September and runs through mid-October. The group also works with young people running summer schools and young archaeologists' clubs.

History The society was founded in 1818 as the London Bricklayers' Society, but by 1829 had developed into a national operative union. By the 1840s the union had about 1,400 members, roughly 2% of the total number of bricklayers in the country at the time. In 1848, twelve former members of the Operative Bricklayers refounded the organisations as the London Order of Operative Bricklayers' Society. They led a strike in 1851 which won an early finish on Saturdays, and in 1854 succeeded in gaining a wage increase for bricklayers in the capital.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.38-39 In 1859 the union became embroiled in a dispute with employers over the introduction of a nine-hour working day, and the consequential London builders' strike was led by George Howell. The OBS was defeated, and subsequently only developed very gradually outside London. In 1867, the union increased contributions from 3d to 10¬Ωd a week, and membership dropped from 5,000 to 2,000. However, in the long run, this improved the union's financial position and strength, and by 1877 it had 6,749 members. By 1900 the union had 38,830 members, but roughly half were based in London. In 1921 the OBS merged with the Manchester Unity of Operative Bricklayers' Society and the Operative Society of Masons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades of England and Wales to form the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers (AUBTW). The People's History Museum in Manchester holds the original emblem painting of the Operative Bricklayers' Society. It was painted in 1869 by Royal Academician Arthur Waudby, and hung in the Bricklayers' Head Office in London. It shows the society's work, proudly depicting the bricklayers' trade along with symbols of truth, architecture and science.

The ectopic heart can be found along a spectrum of anatomical locations, including the neck, chest, or abdomen. In most cases, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum. Pathology Ectopia cordis results from a failure of proper maturation of midline mesoderm and ventral body wall formation during embryonic development. The exact etiology remains unknown, but abnormalities in the lateral body wall folds are believed to be involved. Normally, the lateral body walls are responsible for fusion at the midline to form the ventral wall. Corruption of this process may underlie ectopia cordis. Defective ventral body wall formation yields a heart unprotected by the pericardium, sternum, or skin. Other organs may also have formed outside the skin, as well. Many cases of ectopia cordis have associated congenital heart defects, in which the heart has failed to properly form. Defects more commonly associated with ectopia cordis include: *Intracardiac defects **Atrial septal defect **Ventricular septal defect **Tetralogy of Fallot **Tricuspid atresia **Double outlet right ventricle *Non-cardiac malformations **Pentalogy of Cantrell **Omphalocele **Anterior diaphragmatic hernia **Cleft palate Diagnosis The Diagnosis of ectopia cordis is found with a routine ultrasound as early as the first trimester or the beginning of the second trimester. Treatment Due to the rarity and rapid postpartum mortality of ectopia cordis, limited treatment options have been developed. Only some successful surgeries have been performed as of now, and the mortality rate remains high. Prognosis The prognosis of ectopia cordis depends on classification according to three factors: #Location of the defect #* Cervical #* Thoracic #* Thoracoabdominal #* Abdominal #Extent of the cardiac displacement #Presence or absence of intracardiac defects Some studies have suggested a better prognosis with surgery in cases of thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis or less severe pentalogy of Cantrell. In general, the prognosis for ectopia cordis is poor‚Äîmost cases result in death shortly after birth due to infection, hypoxemia, or cardiac failure. Epidemiology The occurrence of ectopia cordis is 8 per million births. It is typically classified according to location of the ectopic heart, which includes: *Cervical *Thoracic *Thoracoabdominal *Abdominal Thoracic and thoraco-abdominal ectopia cordis constitute the vast majority of known cases.

Career Commencing with the 1944 film, The Town Went Wild, Greene co-wrote many stories and scripts with Russell Rouse. The partners are noted for their work on a series of six film noir movies commencing with D.O.A. (directed by Rudolph Mat√©-1949). With the second film in the series, The Well (1951), they also took on directing and producing: Rouse as director, and Greene as producer. This collaboration continued through the noir series -- The Thief (1952), Wicked Woman (1953), New York Confidential (1955), and House of Numbers (1957) -- and beyond. In the late 1950s, Greene and Rouse formed a production company, Greene-Rouse Productions, which created the film noir television series Tightrope that ran for one season (1959‚Äì60) as well as two films in the 1960s. In addition to their noir work, Rouse and Greene produced two westerns (The Fastest Gun Alive (1956) and Thunder in the Sun (1959). The 1959 film, Pillow Talk, was based on their story. Their careers drew to a close shortly after the unsuccessful film, The Oscar (1966). Rouse and Greene were nominated for the Academy Award for writing The Well (1951). They received the Academy Award for Pillow Talk (1959) (with Maurice Richlin and Stanley Shapiro). D.O.A. has been preserved in the National Film Registry.

He is the eldest child of US president Donald Trump and businesswoman Ivana Trump. A fourth-generation businessman (following his great-grandparents Frederick and Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), Trump Jr. currently serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric. During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so. Trump Jr. also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. Trump Jr. has also been active politically, serving in his father's presidential campaign. He authored a book called Triggered (2019). He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. His promotion of conspiracy theories and false information has prompted criticism. Early life Trump Jr. was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump. He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump Jr. is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump Jr. found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Milo≈° Zeln√≠ƒçek, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language. Trump's parents divorced when he was 13 years old. His mother told him his father was having an extramarital affair. Trump was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family. Trump Jr. was educated at Buckley School and the Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics. Career After graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue, In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later. In 2010 he became a spokesperson for Cambridge Who's Who, a public relations firm that had received hundreds of complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau. He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015. =Trump Organization= On January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, in order to avert a conflict of interest. Amid the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal ‚Äì where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter BidenTrump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \\"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a high-level executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency. The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \\"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\\". According to The Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false. The Washington Post reported that after Trump became president, \\"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\\" In February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \\"conversation and dinner\\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical. Involvement in politics =2016 presidential campaign= Trump Jr. campaigning for his father in Iowa, November 2016 Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a central member of his father's campaign, characterized by The New York Times as a \\"close political adviser\\". He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany. Trump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition. Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \\"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\\". Veselnitskaya meeting On June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov. The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafortand Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov. Approximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting. On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton, which he considered opposition research. Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved. Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting. Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them. In June 2019, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Community made a criminal referral of Trump Jr. to federal prosecutors on suspicions that he misled the committee with his testimony. Meeting with Gulf states emissary Trump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with an emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign. The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince. Correspondence with WikiLeaks In November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to correspond with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which Wikileaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both. =2018 midterm election campaigns= During the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz. He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crowds to campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win. =Other political activities= In 2007, Trump Jr. gave $4,000 to then-Senator Hillary Clinton's campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee. In 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper. In April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte, and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources. In September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents. Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month. In October 2020, it was reported that Pennsylvania Republicans were suggesting Trump Jr. run for the vacant Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 after two- term incumbent Pat Toomey announced he would not be seeking re-election. In October 2020, Trump Jr. held a crowded indoor rally where attendees did not wear masks, contradicting public health guidelines. Views and controversies = Race and immigration = During his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared refugees to Skittles, saying \\"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\\" The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \\"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\\" The Cato Institute reported that year that the chances \\"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\\" per year. On March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional. As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory, or pretending to be an advocate for political gain. In September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's seemingly uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \\"letting her slide on every discrepancy\\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \\"warming up the gas chamber right now\\". Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \\"frog with a wig\\". In April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded Mike Cernovich, who has promoted the white genocide and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theories, saying, \\"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\\". Southern Poverty Law Center reported that Trump appeared at a far-right \\"We Build the Wall\\" event with Neo-Nazi activist Jack Posobiec. = Conspiracy theories = Trump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank. On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes. In March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr. British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him. Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \\"far more important things\\" to do. In May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \\"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death. In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons had murdered people. In February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric. In May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \\"nazi [sic] who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth\\". The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show was cancelled the same day after she had posted a series of racist and antisemitic tweets. A spokesperson for George Soros responded to the tweets, \\"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust.\\" In June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors. In August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram of a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later. In September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist- deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee- deep a distance away. Trump Jr. then proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \\"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was about ten years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding. In May 2020, Trump Jr. falsely accused Joe Biden of being a pedophile. In August 2020, he shared a Breitbart News article about more than 800 dead people voting in Michigan which was framed to suggest that the ballots were not legitimately cast and thus evidence of extensive voter fraud. However, the voters in question died after submitting the ballots, and the ballots were rejected by Michigan authorities who knew the voters had died before the election date. In September 2020, he again pushed false claims about voter fraud by asserting, \\"The radical left are laying the groundwork to steal this election from my father,\\" adding, \\"Their plan is to add millions of fraudulent ballots that can cancel your vote and overturn the election,\\" asking \\"able-bodied\\" people to join an election security \\"army\\" for his father. =COVID-19 misinformation= Trump Jr. was given a 12-hour restriction by Twitter in July 2020 after he promoted misinformation about COVID-19 by retweeting a video showing Houston doctor Stella Immanuel promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure, despite conflicting studies on this claim. The doctor also said that masks are unnecessary. Twitter later said that it did not suspend his account, but rather put some restrictions on it, such as the ability to tweet or retweet, for twelve hours for violating their COVID-19 misinformation policy. =Other= On October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \\"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\\" On November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \\"tomorrow\\", the day after the election. Trump in 2018 In November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so. In June 2020, Trump Jr. criticized liberals for imposing restrictive measures on businesses but supporting left-wing political rallies during the coronavirus pandemic. In New York, thousands of protesters turned out for a protest on behalf of African-American transgender people known as the \\"Action for Black Trans Lives\\" rally. Trump Jr., was shown in a promotion for Desert Tech (a gun company run by a polygamous group) on July 24, 2020 with the company's founder, Nicholas Young, and firing the company's sniper rifles. A marketing video on YouTube also includes an image of Trump Jr. Books =Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us= In 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex. The Washington Post commented: \\"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\\" In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Trump Jr. wrote of a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), commenting that he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \\"all the sacrifices\\" the Trump family had made, including \\"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'\\". Fact-checkers have reported that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president. In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said, \\"fails as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal. (The writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.)\\" The book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the R.N.C. which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively. = Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden and the Democrats' Defense of the Indefensible = In 2020, Trump Jr. self-published the book Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden and the Democrats' Defense of the Indefensible. The book was bought in bulk by the RNC. According to a source cited in The New York Times, Trump Jr. hired three researchers to collect information about Joe Biden. The book took three months to write. Donald Trump Jr. explained to the New York Times his reasons for writing the book: \\"While I had no plans for a book this year, I was stuck indoors like the rest of the nation during the pandemic,\\" he said and \\"I decided to highlight Biden's half century of being a swamp monster, since the media wouldn't do it\\". In the same New York Times article, it stated why Donald Trump Jr. decided to self publish: \\"Because Mr. Trump has his own platform ‚Äî and the promise of bulk purchases from the R.N.C. ‚Äî he doesn't need the publicity arm of a major publisher.\\" Although the article said the RNC would bulk purchase the book, the number of books that will be bought in bulk by the RNC hasn't been released to the public yet. Personal life =Family= Trump Jr. with Kimberly Guilfoyle in July 2019. In 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion. The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a- Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans. They have five children. On March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court. However, later it was revealed that the divorce was contested. The complaint was secret except for the title of the case. On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018. Since 2018, Trump Jr. has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle. Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years. =Hunting= Trump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published, including by Mia Farrow, who reposted them in 2015. Trump Jr. responded by saying \\"I'm not going to run and hide because the peta [sic] crazies don't like me.\\" In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other.Mia Farrow Resurfaces Photo of Trump's Sons Posing with Dead Leopard As Animal Cruelty Becomes Federal Crime, Newsweek, Tufayel Ahmed, November 27, 2019. Retrieved July 13, 2020. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice. On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte. Controversy over Trump Jr.'s big game hunting exploits surfaced again in November 2017, following the Trump administration's decision to allow \\"importing elephant heads, feet and other body parts severed as trophies after the animals are shot for sport in Zimbabwe.\\" Within hours, President Trump reversed the decision to allow elephant trophies imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe, pending further review. ProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep. The sheep hunt and travel to Ulaanbaatar for a private meeting with Mongolian president Khaltmaagiin Battulga cost US taxpayers $76,859.36 for United States Secret Service protection, according to two Freedom of Information Act requests by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Humane Society International wildlife vice president Teresa Telecky said, \\"For trophy hunters to travel to Mongolia to kill a beautiful and endangered ram is an absolute outrage.\\"Cecil the lion's killer is back ‚Äî slaughtering endangered rams in Mongolia, New York Post, Paula Froelich, July 11, 2020.

Nash has worked worldwide with wood, trees and the natural environment. Early life David Nash was born at Esher, Surrey, and raised with his older brother Chris in Weybridge, Surrey where they both attended preparatory school. He spent all his childhood holidays in Ffestiniog, WalesThe Sculpture of David Nash, Julian Andrews, David Nash, p.8, Published by University of California Press, 1999 , David helped clear and replant a nearby forest that his father owned, and also worked for the Commercial Forestry Group. He learned about wood of many kinds and learned he hated planting trees in rows.Tree News, John May, Spring-Summer 2004, UK Artistic career He attended Brighton College from 1959 to 1963, then Kingston College of Art from 1963 to 1967 and the Chelsea School of Art as a postgraduate from 1969 to 1970. Nash was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1999. In 2004, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire. A significant exhibition of his work is displayed in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park for a period in 2010/11. Kew Gardens currently has a working exhibition, launched in June 2012. David Nash is working on site in a 'wood quarry', his first for 10 years, to create new works at Kew. Artistic creations David Nash is known for works in wood and shaping living trees. His large wood sculptures are sometimes carved or partially burned to produce blackening. His main tools for these sculptures are a chainsaw and an axe to carve the wood and a blowtorch to char the wood. Nash also makes land art, of which the best known is Wooden Boulder, begun in 1978. This work involves the journey of a large wooden sphere from a Welsh mountainside to the Atlantic Ocean. Wooden Boulder is a large wooden sphere carved by Nash in the North Wales landscape and left there to weather. Over the years, the boulder has slipped, rolled and sometime been pushed through the landscape following the course of streams and rivers until finally it was last seen in the estuary of the river Dwyryd. It was thought to have been washed out to sea but, after being missing for over five years, the boulder reappeared in June 2009. Indications are that it had been buried in sand in the estuary. The sculptor had no idea of its location, and enjoys the notion that wood which grew out of the land will finally return to it. The boulder was last seen in 2015. Nash also makes sculptures which stay in the landscape. For example, Ash Dome is a ring of ash trees he planted in 1977Cooper, Paul (2001). Living Sculpture. London: Mitchell Beazely. p.107. . and trained to form a domed shape. The dome is sited at a secret location somewhere in Snowdonia and whenever it is filmed, crews are taken there by a circuitous route to guard its security. In the late 1980s, Nash worked at the Djerassi resident artist program, near Woodside, California, where he used Redwood and Madrone wood for his sculptures. Nash has worked with schools, university groups, and teachers throughout his career. He has created a varied body of work in which the relationship between man and nature is a central theme. His artistic ethos has been one of direct, physical involvement with his chosen material ‚Äì wood ‚Äì and the landscape. Since 1967, his sculpture has formed two distinctive groupings; sculptures which connect with the outside, the landscape of making and placements, and works which are presented inside, within and in relation to, architectural environments. The inorganic, non- allusive sculptures that Nash makes using unseasoned wood are based on the universal geometry of the cube, the sphere and the pyramid. He uses the directions of mark-making to his favoured forms: vertical for the cube, horizontal for the sphere, and diagonal for the pyramid. Although the innate character of the material is taken into account, and allowed to affect the outcome, he never allows it to dictate the sculpture's final identity. Nash takes a different approach to carving. Rather than chisels and abrasives, he uses chain saws and a blowtorch. For his work habitat received the 2016 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

The Adelaide Central Market is one of the largest undercover fresh produce markets in the Southern Hemisphere, with 1 million kilograms of fresh produce delivered to the Market and sold every month. The Market offers a huge range of fresh food including fruit and vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood, cheeses, bakery, smallgoods and health foods, along with some of Adelaide's most frequented cafes and eateries. With more than 9.5 million visitations every year (up half a million from 2017), the Adelaide Central Market remains the food mecca for multicultural cuisine and fresh produce. In 2019, the Adelaide Central Market celebrated 150 years of continuous operation, making it the oldest food retail market in its original location in Australia. It is also a popular tourist attraction in the heart of Adelaide and is often referred to as the Central Market. Establishment of the Market Grote Street. The Market began in Grote Street in 1869 and was known as the City Markets, with its official opening by Mayor Judah Solomon on 23 January 1870. In 1869, land was bought in the present day location of the markets for ¬£2600 for three town acres. However, the main markets at that time was the East End Markets that existed between Rundle Street and North Terrace. This market would equal the Adelaide Central Market until 1988. Because of the overflow of the East End Markets, some traders moved to the Central Market. The structure of the building was constructed of wood and iron sheets and completed in June 1869. At its commencement, it opened on Tuesdays and Saturdays with 50 to 100 produce carts. Shops were built along the perimeter of the markets and facing the streets. In the early 1880s, fish supplies were scarce in Adelaide and had to be brought from Port Augusta and Port Pirie by rail. Today the Central Markets are surrounded by the Central Market Arcade, Adelaide China Town, and Market Plaza. The 'centre' of the Central Markets is made up primarily of fresh produce stalls, with the perimeter and arcade shops being mainly caf√©s, restaurants, and variety stores. Expansion and Redevelopment The Central Court On 8 February 1900, a foundation stone was laid by Mayoress Rosa Ware, in the presence of the Mayor of Adelaide, Arthur Ware. Shops were added as well as a refrigeration plant for fruit and fish. Electricity was added in 1902 to replace the gas lighting. Arcade shops were added in 1915 on the eastern side. At that stage, amusements were provided such as darts, billatelle shooting galleries, ball bowling, hoop-la and cheap jacks. The addition of other businesses, such as the Hampshire Hotel in 1911, the Moore's Department stores in 1914 and Her Majesty's Theatre also attracted customers. The Market opened for trading on Tuesday, commencing April 1920. In December 1922, the fish quarters of the Market was demolished and further arcades of 32 shops were added. On 27 December 1925, the North Eastern quarters of the Market were partly damaged through fire. In 1929, butchers' licences for the Market were not renewed because of sanitary concerns. Redevelopment of the Market commenced on 18 January 1965 with the demolition of the east end facade of market in Grote Street and addition of a car park. The new market was opened on 17 June 1966 by Lord Mayor James Irwin. Prior to August 1965, the Market was known as the \\"City Market\\", and after that, it was known as the \\"Central Market\\" being officially opened on 16 August 1965 with this official name. Addition of a Supermarket and Fire Coles Supermarkets joined the neighbouring Central Market Arcade in the Central Market precinct in June 1967. Further undercover car parking was developed as well as the addition of a shopping complex. On 22 June 1977, the Market's southern stall area was badly damaged in a fire. Major restoration was undertaken to repair the damage caused by the fire. There was also at this time, competition from local suburban shopping centres. Further restoration was completed in 1987 and was opened by Lord Mayor James Jarvis on 14 April 1987. The Market currently has 76 stalls in some 8,000 square metres and some 1000 car park spaces exist above the Market Precinct. Central Market Precinct Including the main Central Market building, the Central Market Precinct is composed of five separately managed areas: =Adelaide Central Market= The Market itself holds over 76 stalls in a single undercover area. The Market is owned by the City of Adelaide, is managed by the Adelaide Central Market Authority (a subsidiary and statutory authority of the City of Adelaide), who also manages the carpark above the entire precinct. =Central Market Arcade= Originally known as Victoria Square Arcade, the Central Market Arcade was opened by then Premier David Tonkin on 3 November 1982. It houses over 60 specialty shops and is owned and managed by the City of Adelaide. =The Market Plaza= Linking the Central Market with Chinatown, the Market Plaza houses a number of specialty shops, cafes and a food court.

Their music is largely guitar-based indie rock influenced by psychedelic music. The band makes extensive use of distortion, digital keyboard loops, recorded voice samples, and effects pedals, creating a repeatable orchestrated wall of sound style with vocals. Usually categorized by some reviewers into the shoegaze, dream pop, or space rock genres. This band is not to be confused with the earlier British R&B; group from Ipswich, Suffolk, of the same name (1985‚Äì1993) who issued two albums, Nude Guitarist in Wet Lettuce Frenzy (1987) and Dark Hours (1991); the punk rock band made up of members of The Chesterfield Kings; or the UK outfit performing under the same name. History The Mean Red Spiders formed in Toronto in September 1993. The original members were lead vocalist Greg Chambers, guitarist David Humphreys, drummer Don Goldrick, who named the band, and bassist Nick Andrews.

KrioRus is the only cryonics company in Europe, that possesses its own cryostorage. The company stores bodies (or brains) of its cryopatients ‚Äî dead people and animals, in liquid nitrogen, in the hope that someday it will be possible to revive them by means of the emerging technologies of the future. The company offers a service of freezing either the entire patient's body, or just their head. KrioRus cooperates with other cryonics companies of the world, and facilitates placement of patients' bodies in similar storage facilities, situated outside Russia. Legally, the company has the status of a scientific research organization, engaged in a non-mainstream activity, and its services are not subject to certification. One of the problems with KrioRus activity is considered to be the lack of cryonics-related legislation. The company does not guarantee the revivification of its cryopatient. Criticism of company's activity consists of the criticism of cryonics per se: yet there is little scientific proof that supports the theory of reanimation and most mainstream scientists and doctors express great scepticism about the field. In comparison with foreign cryonics companies, and of the fact that KrioRus, as indeed the other cryonics companies, is not always capable of fulfilling contractual obligations.  History  First attempts at creating a Russian cryocompany were undertaken in the 1990s by physicist Mikhail Solovyev. Initial motivation of the founding was the desire of its nine founding members to freeze their own bodies as well as the bodies of their loved ones in order to be \\"resurrected\\" in future by means of some future medical technologies. Prior to the companys' founding, its prospective staff members have already had some experience in cryopreservation, when in 2003, Igor Artyukhov acted as the chief advisor to a project of preservation of the brain of one deceased biotech scientist. The company has been eventually established in 2005 as a project of an NGO, called Russian Transhumanist Movement. Lydia Fedorenko became the first patient of the company in 2005. However, at that time KrioRus did not yet possess a dedicated cryostorage, and prior to being preserved by the company, her family had for several months kept her brain on dry ice. During the existence of KrioRus, citizens from nine countries have become its patients, including citizens of the United States, Netherlands, Japan, Israel, Italy, Switzerland and Australia. By the same token, cryopreserved relatives of company employees are being kept in cryostorage. On 3 May 2006 the company was formally added to the legal entities register, as required by Russian law. Kriorus cryostorage Initially, cryostorage facility was opened in year 2006, in the village of in Solnechnogorskiy district of the Moscow region, which was followed by the opening of the facility in Sergiev-Posad district of the Moscow region in 2012. In 2016 another move is planned, and is being prepared, to yet another place (near Tver), where the location shall be more conducive to the research activities of the company. According to KrioRus as well as according to the press reports, as of August 15 2019 the company has frozen 70 people (36 bodies and 34 patients' heads), 10 dogs, 17 cats, both male and female, as well as 4 birds and a chinchilla. In addition, there are human and animal DNA samples in storage. Almost as many as 200 Russian citizens have entered into cryopreservation agreements with the company. It is thought that KrioRus has become, during the 2010s, the third largest cryonics company in the world and now provides competition to companies such as Alcor (which has about 170 people in cryostorage). In addition, KrioRus is the first cryocompany in Europe, that possesses its own cryostorage facility. The company has taken part in a number of Russian and international exhibitions, both dedicated to medicine as well as to the funeral homes business: * Health Industry-2012 (). * The exhibition Necropolis () ‚Äî annual, during 2013‚Äì2016. At the Necropolis-2013 expo, KrioRus has, for the first time, demonstrated the possibilities of cryonics and cryopreservation for the benefit of the funeral industry workers' and won the gold medal in the Innovations category. * Regional industrial exhibition Necropolis-Siberia () in 2016. * ¬´TanExpo¬ª ‚Äî April 2016 (Italy, Bologna).  Top management and staff  CEO of the company is , who has held this position since June 2009. Since the day of the founding and until June 2009, position of CEO has been occupied by Danila Medvedev, who currently serves as the Chairman of the board of directors as well as the deputy to CEO for strategic development. Director for Science is the biophysicist, Igor Artyukhov. Valeria Udalova, Danila Medvedev and Igor Artyukhov are among the nine founders of the company listed at its inception. In 2010, the number of KrioRus founders' has increased to 10, and in 2016 it is at 11. The KrioRus research team is headed by cryobiologist Yuri Pichugin, PhD, who has spent time from 2001 to 2007 working in Cryonics Institute (USA, Detroit).  Activities  In accordance with the state statistical rubricator, the company is engaged in research and development, insurance as well as provision of \\"other kinds of services\\". However, the company is presenting its activities as the provision of services, facilitating preservation of the bodies of their \\"cryopatients\\" in liquid nitrogen ‚Äî of dead people and animals (or their respective brains) ‚Äî in the hope that someday they it would become possible to revive them through the means of some highly advanced future technologies. Generally the bulk of company's clients are educated people of moderate means, both men and women in equal proportions. Company representatives attitude to the possibility of \\"resurrection\\" is described by them as follows (in reply to the question: \\"Doesn't cryonics give false hope?\\"): \\"There is no concrete evidence as to whether the development of cryonics would end in is success or will it fail. But the fact that the concept of cryonics is currently dependent upon a yet unknown science of the future, and that its success cannot be guaranteed, it is not the same as its guaranteed failure \\". One of the key advantages KrioRus possesses is the cost of its services, primarily for Russian and non-US citizens. Unlike American companies, KrioRus was founded in such a way, that it is not subject to the rules governing medical and funeral activities. As a result, the company does not face regulatory challenges in such fields of activity as acquisition of bodies from hospitals and morgues. Furthermore, it matters that KrioRus has a cleaner reputation than Alcor, which has suffered a few scandals. Danila Medvedev describes this situation as follows: \\"We didn‚Äôt have the crisis that they had in the 1970s. People in Russia have no negative impression of cryonics\\". Despite skepticism of its US competitors, KrioRus plans to implement the world's first center, where patients would die and be frozen, all in the same building. Company's cryostorage facility is designed to be able to relocate quickly in case of war, natural disasters etc., in which case it can be moved in the space of a few days, while its storage tanks are capable to work autonomously and to sustain necessary temperature for two days. In the United States, as in Russia, cryonics companies employ largely the same cryopreservation procedures ‚Äî after biological and legal death of the patient has been established, blood is evacuated from the body (and is replaced with a special solution, so prepared that its crystallization during the freezing process would not destroy the cells), the body is cooled down to the temperature of dry ice (-79 ¬∞C), transported and then cooled down to ultra low temperature (-196 ¬∞C) and placed in a long-term storage tank. Choices to preserve only the head occur not only due to financial considerations, but also because of the belief that in the future, technology would allow to restore the lost body, and the identity will be safeguarded in the brain. One of the problems of cryonics is to provide for a quick patient admission, since the quicker this occurs, the better it is possible to preserve the body. To address this problem, the company has several mobile teams of specialists across the country, who can quickly go and provide patients with necessary primary procedures on the spot. Similarly, KrioRus is cooperating with regional doctors, and provides them with lessons in primary preparative procedures for cryopreservation. As an additional service to complement its chief one, KrioRus offers help in safekeeping the lives' archives of their clients (blogs, video recordings), that should help to restore the identity of the person in the future. 18 January 1912. The last photo of Robert Scott's group. One of the directions of company's development is the creation of cryostorage facilities in a neutral country such as Switzerland. This country is one of the primary target countries because it has allowed euthanasia, with the help of which one can create better conditions for cryopreservation. Also, representatives of the company named one of the objectives the improvement of the cryopatient preparation and transportation procedures, which will enable the provision of cryonics services to customers from all over the world, including such countries as Ecuador and China. Among other potential business activities of the company, was mentioned sperm freezing, as were freezing of embryos and organs, Cryobank creation, tours of cryostorage facilities, visiting relatives provided patients are stored in transparent sarcophagi, introduction of cryonics to the voluntary health insurance, etc. KrioRus conducts its research in two laboratories ‚Äî in Moscow and in Voronezh. This work is focused on improving the process of cryopreservation itself, e.g., to improve vitrification technology, or to develop an apparatus, permitting storage in a gaseous environment with the controlled supply of liquid nitrogen. A separate scientific field of study is the reversible defrosting of organs. Currently, organ storage timeframe for transplantation is just a few hours, while this technology has the potential to allow to store such organs indefinitely. The company collaborates with the in the field of reversible organ deep-freeze technologies. In addition, KrioRus cooperates with other cryonics companies of the world, facilitates exchanges of valuable experience and assists individuals, wishing to put their bodies in a similar storage facility, located outside of Russia. ‚Äî ¬´Here, a body awaits being placed in a storage tank at the KrioRus facility near Moscow, Russia. One facility in the US offers the entire process and storage for about US $25,000 (?15,000) but others charge in excess of $100,000. A cheaper option offered by the companies is to preserve a person's head instead of the entire body¬ª.  Legal aspects  When clients deal with KrioRus, they sign a contract to carry out scientific experiment on the preservation and revitalization of a human, and at the same time KrioRus demands that the customer acknowledges the fact that the contractor does not provide guarantees to revive the cryopatient. The agreement covers safekeeping of the bodies for up to 100 years, with the possibility of extension. Maria Bast, chairman of the Russian Lawyers Association for Human Rights, have said that the status of KrioRus as a scientific organisation is justified, and the problem stems from the lack of legislation in the field of cryonics. However, there is a precedent, when in 2005 in Novosibirsk, the relatives of the deceased were keeping his body in a deep freeze and the state prosecutor did not find that it constituted a crime. According to the lawyer Svetlana Yudina, judging from a legal point of view, the company is involved in non-standard activities, but that does not necessarily mean that its employees are crooks. This is being justified as follows: \\"Activities, directed towards cryopreservation of people can be considered fraud if an employee makes assurances or promises that the frozen corpse would inevitably come to life under any circumstances, and even specifies the date or the period when such a miracle is to be expected. Similarly, it can be considered fraud if an employee is presenting falsified evidence of successful experiments, photos, videos of re-animated people, and so on. However if the workers simply argue that a revival is possible, but by means of methods that have not yet been invented, no deception is to be found there\\". According to the Health Ministry press service, cryonics companies' services are not subject to certification, since research is their chief activity. In order for a person's body to be transferred postmortem to KrioRus, it is required that the individual in question would have stated in their will that their body should be handed over to the cryonics company, and in such a case, these works can not be prohibited by law. Otherwise, from a legal point of view one, is required to settle the problem with the client's next of kin. However, even with contract and with the will both being available one could run into problems (e.g., due to the \\"hostile wife\\" phenomenon).  Criticism  The company's activity is seen in the context of criticism of cryonics as such. At present, the question of the possibility of \\"resurrection\\" of cryopatient is an open one in scientific community. On one hand, there are no known cases of \\"resurrection\\" of cryopatients, and cryonics companies (KrioRus included) do not guarantee such an outcome. On the other hand, there are experimental arguments in favour of the hypothesis of a successful \\"resurrection\\". From theoretical and research perspectives there is a number of arguments both in favour of cryonics supporters and in favour of its opponents. When comparing KrioRus and Alcor, journalists call the first company Lada of the world of cryonics, and the second one ‚Äî Mercedes-Benz. Alcor cryonics is the largest cryonics company in the world, twice a week it conducts tours of its premises, demonstrating the operating room (where vitrification and freezing are conducted), as well as long-term cryopatients' storage facilities, where they could just be seen through bulletproof glass. On the other side, KrioRus does not offer any such services. There is a known case of the \\"hostile wife\\" phenomenon in the practice of the company. In 2012, cancer patient, engineer Mikhail Voronin has signed a contract with the company KrioRus on neuropreservation and paid 300 thousand rubles. However, after the death, engineer's body complete with the brain has been cremated, by the widow, who \\"stole\\" Mikhails' body from the hospital and did not allow it to come into possession of the company. Thus, the employees' KrioRus were not able to cryopreserve patient, despite the fact that he has stated his will in writing and even recorded a video missive. Later, the court rejected the company's plea.

Teesport is the logistical hub for the commodity chemical and steel companies that are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). =Facilities= Teesport's facilities include: *Tees Dock Terminal: handling bulk cargo, which accounts for 73% of the port's volume. **Redcar Ore Terminal: deep-sea bulk terminal facility that handles more than eight million tons of imports a year, mainly iron ore **Cleveland Potash bulk terminal: handles more than a million tons of potash and salt exports, mainly from Boulby Mine **Steel Export Terminal: equipped with eight gantry cranes, it handles over a million tons of steel slab export a year. Can also handle wood imports, including tropical hardwood, fiberboard, plus softwood and pulp from Scandinavia *Teesport Container Terminals: two computerised Container quays, capable of handling 500,000 TEU per annum **TCT1 at , which can hold 1,872 TEU at quayside **TCT2 at , specifically developed deep-sea cargo quay which presently handles customers including CMA CGM. TCT2 has its own specifically built railhead, which was developed in partnership with DB Cargo UK *Roll-on/roll-off: P&O; Ferries operates eight sailings to Rotterdam and six to Zeebrugge per week. An extension of allows the import of 100,000 cars by Renault, while General Motors sub-leases *Dawson's Wharf: handles dry cargo from a river-facing quay, handling 400 thousand tonnes of bulk minerals and non-hazardous chemicals *Cochrane's Wharf: a site operated by Tarmac Aggregates for the import of dredged marine materials =Landside= Landside clients include Hanson plc who operate a major cement works, and a landfill site which uses non-hazardous waste to backfill the site of the former Tees Dock facility. Tesco operate a high-bay non-food storage and distribution facility at Teesport. The currently under-construction Teesport Renewable Energy Plant is scheduled to come into operation in 2015. =Northern Gateway Terminal= In February 2008, PD Ports were given planning permission to redevelop the former Shell Oil refinery in a ¬£350 million scheme that would create a new container facility, entitled the Northern Gateway Terminal, which would raise TEU capacity of the entire port to 1.5 million TEU. However, due to the 2008 economic downturn, PD Ports put back the start of development until 2010 at the earliest, with the programme now scheduled to complete in 2020. =Transport connections= PD Ports leases a number of former-British Rail Class 08 shunting locomotives from RMS Locotec to move rail traffic around the port, and to/from the two main associated marshalling yards. The port is directly rail connected to the East Coast Main Line and the Durham Coast Line, and close to the A66 trans-pennine route, and other major trunk roads. History The first developed facility on the current Teesport location was a Royal Navy depot during World War I. This allowed the allocated six British E-class submarines to operate further into the North Sea during their defence, attack and mine laying operations against the Imperial German Navy. At this time, commercial port facilities were still handled at Middlesbrough Docks, located further upstream. In the 1920s, Eston Urban District Council decided to turn the 13 former dormitories of the former Royal Navy facility into 38 small houses, within a community called Teesport. By the start of World War II, of the original 130 residents that came when the community was developed, only 3 remained. This was because in 1934, the joint owners of the land on which the community was built ‚Äì riverside and shoreline Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson; landside Dorman Long ‚Äì had written to the council to seek assurances that they would not let any more houses within the community, so allowing the land owners to take back possession and be allowed to develop their businesses on the land. After the war, due to over-crowding around the original Port Darlington and Middlesbrough Docks facility, both companies developed industrial facilities on the land, and sub-leased some land to other commercial operations. Between 1965 and 1968, three oil refineries were developed close to Teesport, thanks to the Phillips Petroleum's development of the Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea. The first two were jointly developed and operated by Phillips and ICI on the north shore of the River Tees at the North Tees Works, just south of Greatham Creek. After processing this facility fed cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene to ICI's chemical plants at Billingham and Wilton. The third refinery was developed in 1968 by Shell Oil on the south shore within Teesport. This facility was served by what became known as Tees Dock, with the whole docks facility designed around Panamax scale ships. In 1980, with the discovery of North Sea gas, a pipeline was installed between Ekofisk and Seal Sands on the north shore. Although the Shell refinery was mothballed in 1989 and later closed, and the north shore facility of Petroplus closed in 2010, as a result of the pipeline petrochemicals traffic still today represents about 50% of the cargo through Teesport, around 26 million tonnes a year. In 1992 the Port Authority of Tees and Hartlepool was privatised, with the original three buyers subsequently reduced to a single owner, Powell Duffryn Plc, in 1995. With traffic out- scaling the port's handling and ship-scale facilities, PD Ports then developed TCT2 in 2002 specifically as a deep-sea cargo quay on top of the site that used to be the original Tees Dock.
