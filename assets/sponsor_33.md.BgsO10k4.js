She was born in Yunzhouxi village, in the Wenshui County of the Shanxi province. She joined the Communist Party in 1946 and soon after joined an association of women working in support of the Liberation Army. She was actively involved in organizing the villagers of Yunzhouxi in support of the Communist Party of China. Her contributions involved a wide range of activities, such as supplying food to the Eighth Liberation Army, relaying secret messages, and mending boots and uniforms.  Life Story  On October 8, 1932, Ms. Liu Hulan was born in a middle-class peasant family in Yunzhou West Village, Shanxi Province. In January 1945, Liu Hulan participated in the movement of seizing gain by the Western Union and loaded grain with the revolutionaries. In October 1945, Liu Hulan carried her family to Guanjiabao village and participated in the training course of women's liberation. She was elected as a group leader and devoted herself to study. At the local anti- hegemony meeting, she took the stage to speak, denounced the crimes of the hegemonic landlords and the feudal customs. After graduation, she served as secretary of Village Women's Rescue Committee. She organized women to run winter schools, helped the martyrs to solve difficulties, supported the army. Together with party members, she fought against landlords, delivered public grain and made military shoes, mobilized young people to join the army. In February 1946, Liu Hulan took part in the pre-support work of the Dongzhuang battle against Yan Xishan's recalcitrant army. In 1946, 2000 of the cotton spinning task was handed down in the country, with a deadline of 20 days. Liu Hulan led women to finished the task two days ahead of schedule and won first place in the town. In May 1946, Liu Hulan was transferred to the Woman's Officer of the 15 District ‚ÄúAnti-Japanese League‚Äù. She returned to the West Village of Yunzhou to lead the local land reform movement. In October 1946, Liu Hulan and her remaining comrades conveyed the Communist Party's instructions to the village Communist Organizations and organized the masses to bury grain. In December 1946, Liu Hulan cooperates with the members of the martial arts team to execute the reactionary village leader ShiPeihuai. Yan Xishan Bandit Army decided to make a large-scale attack on Wenshui area as retaliatory. In order to preserve strength, the 8 Communist Party committees decided to transfer most of the cadres from Pingchuan to Shanshan. Liu hulan was familiar with the environment, therefore volunteered to stay. the party accepted her request. Wang Being, the company commander of the 12 regiments was wounded. Liu human hid Wang Being in a military family, and carefully nursed him until he recovered. In December, the enemy frequently attacked the Western village of Yunzhou and arrested the underground workers such as Shi Sanhuai. Liu Hulan's family advised her to withdraw, but she insisted on waiting for her superiors. On January 11, 1947, the superior informed her to transfer. On the next day, the Kuomintang army surrounded the western village of Yunzhou and forced the whole village to gather at Guanyin Temple. The Kuomintang arrested several communists including Shi Shihui, Chen Shurong, Liu Shushan and Zhang Nanchang. Liu Hulan was also arrested as a traitor. During the interrogation, the Kuomintang tried every possible method to induce Liu Hulan to betray her allies. Liu Hulan refused to obey and died heroically.  Anecdotes  Liu Hulan's had two engagements in her life, a love affair and a ghost marriage. At the beginning of 1946, the parents of the two sides took the initiative to engage Liu Hulan with Chen De, a young man from the neighboring village. However, both parties advocated free love, so they agreed to go home and persuade their parents to terminate their marriage. In June of the same year, someone came to ask for relatives. Liu Hulan refused because she did not know the real situation of the man because he was not often home when he was an apprentice in Taigu County. At that time, Liu Hulan had made up her mind to pursue independent love and marriage. In the autumn of the same year, Wang Gengu, commander of a PLA regiment, was sent to Yunzhou West Village for training. Wang Gengu suffered from severe scabies. This disease was contagious. Liu Hulan took the initiative to take care of him. Liu Hulan often went to cook and apply medicine for Wang Gengu. They had a lot of contacts and they fell in love. In those days, in the countryside where feudal ideology was more serious, this kind of behavior showed exactly an anti-feudal emancipation of the mind. Because of the dangerous war environment and Liu Hulan's young age, her marriage with Wang Gengu has not yet been discussed. At that time, Commander Wang gave Liu Hulan's family only a blanket, a pen and a pair of glasses as a pledge. He gave Liu Hulan a small handkerchief as a souvenir when he returned to the army for combat. Liu Hulan handed the handkerchief to his stepmother, Hu Wenxiu, as the most precious item before he was sentenced to death. After Liu Hulan was murdered, Liu Guangqian, the elder uncle, managed to match ghost marriage according to local customs and sacrifices together.  Death  On January 12, 1947, the Kuomintang army under Yan Xishan invaded her village in response to the assassination of Shi Peihuai, the village chief of Yunzhouxi, who was known to be loyal to the Kuomintang. Upon entering the village, Kuomintang soldiers rounded up several reputed Communist Party members believed to be involved in the assassination, among them the teenager Liu Hulan. The party members were decapitated in the town square. Before killing Liu Hulan, the executioners paused, giving her one final chance to renounce her allegiance to the Communist Party. She refused and was immediately beheaded. She was 14 years old.  Significance  On February 6, 1947, Jinsui Daily published a detailed report on Liu Hulan's heroic inauguration and issued a comment calling on all Communist Party members and the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas to learn from Liu Hulan. On the same day, the Yenan Liberation Daily also published an article entitled \\"As long as there is a breath of life, we must do it for the people to the end - female Communist Party member Liu Hulan generously righteous\\". The Jinsui Branch of the CPC Central Committee has endorsed Liu Hulan as a full member of the CPC. On March 26, 1947, during Mao Zedong's transition to northern Shaanxi under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ren Bishi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat, reported to him Liu Hulan's heroic deeds. Mao Zedong asked, \\"Is she a Party member?\\" Ren Bishi said, \\"He is an excellent Communist Party member, only 15 years old.\\" Moved deeply, Mao Zedong wrote eight big words: \\"the greatness of life and the glory of death\\". Comrade Deng Xiaoping inscribed: \\"Liu Hulan's noble qualities and her spiritual outlook will always be an example for Chinese youth and adolescents to learn from.\\" On February 2, 1994, General Secretary Jiang Zemin inscribed Liu Hulan during his inspection in Shanxi Province: \\"Carry forward the spirit of Hulan and devote oneself to the great cause of Four Modernizations.\\" The life and death of Liu Hulan has become a symbol of the courage of the Chinese people, and is often cited as a homily of their loyalty to Communism. Her story is often told as an homage to the struggles endured, and the sacrifices made, for the cause of liberating China from centuries of rule by foreign powers. In recent history, Chinese political leaders have praised her heroism as the reason why the Chinese Communist Party has risen to take a dominant place in the politics and culture of modern China. She is the subject of a 1949 opera, remade in 1954: Liu Hulan.  Influence  In February 1947, Shanxi Jinsui Daily published the news of Liu Hulan's heroic sacrifice. Liu Hulan's name spread all over North China. At that time, the \\"Battle Theatre Club\\" of the 12th Division took Liu Hulan's glorious deeds as its theme, and in more than a month, it created the opera Liu Hulan, which gave the audience a lot of education in each performance. Six months after Liu Hulan's sacrifice, on August 1, 1947, the Jinsui Branch of the Communist Party of China decided to break the rules (usually until he was 18 years old) and recognize Liu Hulan as a full member of the Communist Party of China. After the liberation of the whole country, Liu Hulan's deeds were written into books, adapted into plays, movies and TV plays, and her former village was changed to \\"Liu Hulan Village\\". In 1956, the Liu Hulan Memorial Hall was established in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province. The Martyrs'Cemetery was built in Yunzhou West Village, the hometown of the martyrs. The Yongzhi Memorial was commemorated. The remains of Liu Hulan were moved to the cemetery separately. With a total floor area of more than 60,000 square meters, it is composed of square, monument, Liu Hulan's life story exhibition room, film and television room, calligraphy and painting room, seven Martyrs Memorial Hall and group sculptures, mausoleum, Liu Hulan statue, monument pavilion, martyr's original site, symmetrically distributed with monuments and mausoleums as the central axis, and contains 74 martyr relics. On January 31, 1977, China issued a set of stamps commemorating the 30th anniversary of Liu Hulan's heroic inauguration in commemoration of Comrade Liu Hulan, the revolutionary martyr.

Agriculture is the main industry and commerce is non-existent. There is a concrete products company and a church in the hamlet. It is one of the westernmost communities in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada. Frogmore's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300‚Äì350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Frogmore became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. Summary This community has approximately 147 people; a sizeable population of them are German Mennonites and Mexican Mennonites. Named in 1886 after one of Queen Victoria's residences in Hampshire, England.Basic information at Rural Routes Six wind turbines with a generation capacity of approximately 9 MW of electricity have been placed in the vicinity, about 7 kilometres to the south near the shore of Lake Erie.Frogmore Wind Project at Canadian Wind Energy Association Norfolk County regional council passed a resolution to be an \\"unwilling host\\" to future wind turbine development in May 2013. Frogmore is not seeing notable population growth as people may choose to move to the larger nearby communities of Simcoe, Delhi, and Tillsonburg. The popular tourist destination of Port Burwell is just a 30 minutes' drive to the southwest of this community. Another historic community, Sparta, along with the St. Thomas Raceway Park lies 45 minutes to the southwest from Frogmore. =Climate= The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the region from 1897 to 1977. From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Frogmore traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has altered the climate of Frogmore over the decades.

She has a latent superpower (the U-Mind), and has been abducted by various races who wanted to harness the power, and temporarily became a villainess. All memories of her experiences with the U-Mind have now been blocked after she was mindwiped. She is bisexual and has been romantically linked to both Green Lantern and Icemaiden. Fictional character biography A toy saleswoman and rival of Hal Jordan‚Äô's, Olivia later became his girlfriend. For a long time, she was unaware of her latent power, her U-Mind that sustained an entire race (the Lenglyns of Lengyl). When the alien Mogrians sought to retrieve the U-mind, Hal (as Green Lantern) and Flash battled them to save Olivia as well as the Lenglyns. Green Lantern # 29: Olivia Reynolds returns to face Hal Jordan. The Weaponers of Qward later kidnapped her, seeking to use her U-Mind to tap into a power called the Ergono and open the obelisk, a monument left behind by the ancient Qward. Hal and Dr. Eli Bently (Olivia's physician) saved her, but not before the obelisk was shattered. Years later, Olivia returned into Hal's life as a representative for the new Green Lantern toyline and they renewed their romance. During this time, the Lenglyns and the Weaponers of Qward attempted to control the Ergono power by abducting Olivia and Aleea Strange (daughter of Adam Strange) (whom they realized had the U-Mind power). A band of Qward soldiers captured Olivia again, hoping that her presence would help them oppose the Weaponers. This time, the power of the Ergono usurped her. Driven mad with power, she sought to become queen of Qward. Green Lantern came into direct contact with Ergono and was subsequently captured by Olivia, who has been possessed by it. While subdued, he comes to the following realization: \\"The first time I was blasted by Ergono I was hammered by an awareness of my own mortality. It shook me. It nearly finished me. I rallied back on pure emotion -- but after the incident was over I never felt quite the same. Just a few days later I had that confrontation in Star City with Green Arrow. I stopped a young ghetto dweller from attacking a slumlord -- and Arrow ridiculed me, accused me of playing super-cop to feed my ego. Normally, I'd've told him to let me do my job. But instead -- it shook me to the core of my being. For years after that my will was shaky. I lacerated myself with doubt and indecision. Dear Lord. Were all those years of confusion caused by that one blast of Ergono?\\" This later raised the question about whether his exposure to Ergono caused his eventual transformation into Parallax . Hal and Adam Strange rescued Olivia from the Ergono's control, and then Hal wiped clean Olivia's memories of her U-Mind and any events on Qward.

It is caused by a variety of recessively inherited mutations in the XK gene on the X chromosome. The gene is responsible for producing the Kx protein, a secondary supportive protein for the Kell antigen on the red blood cell surface. Presentation Patients usually begin to notice symptoms in their 50s and the course is usually slowly progressive. Common features include peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and hemolytic anemia. Other features include limb chorea, facial tics, other oral movements (lip and tongue biting), seizures, a late-onset dementia, and behavioral changes. Genetics The McLeod phenotype is a recessive mutation of the Kell blood group system. The McLeod gene encodes the XK protein, which is located on the X chromosome, and has the structural characteristics of a membrane transport protein but an unknown function. Absence of the XK protein is an X-linked disease. Mutational variants result in McLeod syndrome either with or without neuroacanthocytosis: the gene on the X chromosome for McLeod syndrome is physically close to the gene for chronic granulomatous disease. As a result, an individual with one relatively small deletion may have both diseases. The phenotype may be present without the syndrome presenting. Diagnosis =Laboratory features= McLeod syndrome is one of only a few disorders in which acanthocytes may be found on the peripheral blood smear. Blood evaluation may show signs of hemolytic anemia. Elevated creatine kinase can be seen with myopathy in McLeod syndrome. =Radiologic and pathologic features= MRI shows increased T2 signal in the lateral putamen with caudate atrophy and secondary lateral ventricular dilation. Necropsy shows loss of neurons and gliosis in the caudate and globus pallidus. Similar changes may also be seen in the thalamus, substantia nigra, and putamen. The cerebellum and cerebral cortex are generally spared. Treatment There is no cure for McLeod syndrome; the treatment is supportive depending on symptoms. Medication may assist with management of epilepsy, and cardiac and psychiatric features, although patients may respond poorly to treatment for chorea. Prognosis A typical patient with severe McLeod syndrome that begins in adulthood lives for an additional 5 to 10 years. Patients with cardiomyopathy have elevated risk for congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The prognosis for a normal life span is often good in some patients with mild neurological or cardiac sequelae. Epidemiology McLeod syndrome is present in 0.5 to 1 per 100,000 of the population. McLeod males have variable acanthocytosis due to a defect in the inner leaflet bilayer of the red blood cell, as well as mild hemolysis. McLeod females have only occasional acanthocytes and very mild hemolysis; the lesser severity is thought to be due to X chromosome inactivation via the Lyon effect. Some individuals with McLeod phenotype develop myopathy, neuropathy, or psychiatric symptoms, producing a syndrome that may mimic chorea. McLeod syndrome can cause an increase in the enzymes creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) found in routine blood screening.Oechsner M, G. Winkler G, A. Danek A, \\"McLeod neuroacanthocytosis: An underdiagnosed syndrome?\\" International communication forum in human molecular genetics September 6, 1995 History McLeod syndrome was discovered in 1961 and, as with the Kell antigen system, was named after the first patient in which it was found: Harvard dental student Hugh McLeod, whose red blood cells were observed to have weak expression of Kell system antigens during blood donation, and found to be acanthocytic (spiky) under the microscope. The wives of King Henry VIII of England show a pattern of pregnancies and infant deaths, which with his mental deterioration suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome.

She often published her writings under the signature Bansai. In 1914 she published En piga bland pigor which was an early form of investigative journalism and received a lot of attention. She continued with investigative journalism and later wrote reportages about Lapland, USA and Kamchatka. She also wrote a few works of fiction. In her girl's book the protagonist develops towards independence, not with marriage as the primary goal as was usual at the time. \\"...Nordstr√∂m began working as a journalist under the pseudonym The Boy and, at the age of twenty-three, wrote a best-selling book that exposed the harsh working conditions of household servants in Sweden. A kind of female Bruce Chatwin, Nordstrom toured around Sweden by motorcycle; hitchhiked alone across the U.S., in 1922 (and wrote a book about it); spent five years exploring Kamchatka (ditto); wrote a series of young-adult novels about tomboys; and, apparently, caused everyone she encountered, male and female, to fall in love with her.\\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-best-facts-i-learned- from-books-in-2015 Biography Nordstr√∂m was a sister to dentist and entomologist Frithiof Nordstr√∂mRotemannen, CD-ROM, Sveriges Sl√§ktforskarf√∂rbund/Stockholms Stadsarkiv (2012). as well as aunt to lyricist Gunilla Sandberg. She was a lesbian, which at the time was punishable by law and classified as an illness, and had a relationship with Carin Frisell that lasted her entire life. She wrote for Svenska Dagbladet from 1911‚Äì1917 under the pen name Bansai. In 1914 she took a job as a maid and reported on her experiences in a reportage series that made her famous: En m√•nad som tj√§nsteflicka p√• en g√•rd i S√∂dermanland (A Month as a Servant Girl on a Farm in S√∂dermanland). She also documented her experiences in a book, En piga bland pigor (A Maid Among Maids), which was a success, published in several editions, and even serialized in the 1924 film series of the same name. Nordstr√∂m has been called Sweden's first undercover journalist. Nordstr√∂m continued with investigative journalism. She worked as a teacher in Lappland and lived for one year in Sami society. In 1922, she traveled to New York on a third-class ticket and worked as a waitress and kitchen help. Later she hitchhiked throughout the US. She published her experiences in the book Amerikanskt. From 1925‚Äì1929 she was married to entomologist Ren√© Malaise and participated in his research in Kamchatka in the Soviet Union.

Local police officers confronted and opened fire on supporters of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Four Nationalist Party members were killed, and one police officer was wounded during the shooting. Prelude to the massacre In 1931, the U.S.-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. named Dr. Carlos E. Chard√≥n as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. He was the first Puerto Rican to have this position. In 1935, Chard√≥n initiated a project based on the ideas of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who at the time was a Senator in the Puerto Rican legislature and member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chard√≥n.Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia, Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938; p. 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); Don Pedro Albizu Campos, 1936 Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, knew that Roosevelt had been implicated as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in helping Secretary Albert Fall of the Department of Interior to arrange for private leasing of Navy oil fields, in what became known as the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s. Albizu Campos worried that Plan Chard√≥n would strip Puerto Rico of her natural resources. He believed that Chard√≥n had been placed in charge of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) in order to \\"Americanize\\" the university with the support of the Liberal Party. On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chard√≥n, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an \\"American\\" propaganda institution.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 305 On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chard√≥n began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos \\"Student Enemy Number One.\\" In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chard√≥n and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 306 Massacre On October 24, 1935, a student assembly held at the university declared Albizu Campos as persona non grata. Chard√≥n requested that the governor provide armed police officers on the university grounds, in case the situation turned violent. Two police officers spotted a \\"suspicious-looking vehicle\\" and asked the driver, Ram√≥n S. Pag√°n, and his friend Pedro Qui√±ones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pag√°n and Qui√±ones. The local newspaper, El Mundo, reported on October 25, that the day before observers heard an explosion followed by gunfire; Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Vega and Jos√© Santiago Barea were also killed that day.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 306 An eyewitness, Isolina Rond√≥n, testified that she saw the police officers shooting at the victims and heard one police officer screaming \\"not to let them escape alive.\\" Her testimony was ignored, and no charges were filed against the police officers.

Aftermath At the time of the massacre, the top-ranking U.S.-appointed police chief on the island was a former U.S. Army Colonel named Elisha Francis Riggs. Since the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs, the Nationalists considered him responsible for the massacre. Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood located in northwest Washington, D.C.. Riggs was a former officer in the United States Army who was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing sugar cane labor movement and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement.\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony\\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); .

They attacked the police chief while he was returning home after attending mass in San Juan's Cathedral. Rosado and Beauchamp were arrested and executed at the police headquarters in San Juan without a trial. Before his death, Beauchamp posed with a military salute for a news photographer.The Puerto Ricans: A Documentary History, Markus Wiener Publishers, 2008, p. 179 News of the assassination spread throughout the United States. The Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who was in Washington, D.C. at the time, was asked by Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935‚Äì1937), to condemn Riggs's assassination. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n declined, unless he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering Nationalists in a city police station without a trial. Gruening joined US Senator Millard Tydings from Maryland, a Democrat, in a 1943 legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico. Although the measure was welcomed by every political party in Puerto Rico, including Mu√±oz' Liberal Party, the senator opposed the measure. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n said that independence would hurt Puerto Rico's economy. He contrasted the proposed bill with the provisions of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, which provided independence for the Philippines after a 10-year transition period. Due to his opposition, the bill did not progress in Congress, and Puerto Rico did not receive its political independence from the U.S. In 1950, the 81st United States Congress passed legislation to enable the people of Puerto Rico to organize a local government pursuant to a constitution of their own, comparable to those of other territories and states of the United States. From its enactment until this day, the act has served as the organic law for the government of Puerto Rico and its relation with the United States. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, as Governor of Puerto Rico, supported the measure. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n became the first native-born elected governor of Puerto Rico.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo After Riggs's assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned.

Lamberton is renowned for his influential role during the Scottish Wars of Independence. He campaigned for the national cause under William Wallace and later Robert the Bruce. As Bishop of St Andrews, the most powerful seat in Scotland, Bishop Lamberton along with Bishop Robert Wishart of Glasgow conducted the coronation of Robert the Bruce as King Robert I. Lamberton would go on to have a vital role in the formulation of the Declaration of the Clergy 1310 and the Declaration of Arbroath which would lead to Scottish Independence. During his tenure Lamberton was excommunicated by Rome for his role in the Wars of Independence along with Robert I and the Clergy of Scotland. However, he was reconciled with the Papacy before his death.  Birth and early life  Details from the National Dictionary of Biography do seem to clarify his origins in the Lamberton family, originally from Berwickshire, but holding lands in north-east Scotland by the late twelfth century and later in Stirlingshire also. Details of his birth, education, and early career are not certain; he had certainly received a university education by early 1293 and become a canon of Glasgow. By the time of his appearance at King John's (Baliol) first parliament in February 1293 he was chancellor of Glasgow Cathedral.\\"Bishop William Lamberton\\", People of Medieval Scotland Resource He seems to have been sent abroad for further study by Bishop Robert Wishart of Glasgow, probably in the year or two before July 1295. seal of Bishop William de Lamberton. The Lamberton surname is recorded in one source as having a close association with the ancient Barony of Kilmaurs, Ayrshire and the Lands of Lambroughton. William Lamberton however most probably originated from the settlement of Lamberton, near Berwick in the Scottish Borders where the family held large estates (Logan Mack 1926). The name Lamberton here was derived from the Germanic name Lambert, whilst Lambroughton, sometimes spelt Lamberton, is derived from a corruption of the clan McLamroch.  Bishop of Saint Andrews  He was appointed Bishop of St Andrews in 1298 by Pope Boniface VIII in succession to William Fraser. Lamberton appears to have been a very odd choice for a Bishop as he was very young at the time. However, according to Scottish historian Geoffrey Barrow Lamberton landed the position of Bishop due to then Guardian William Wallace who saw Lamberton as a potential ally and supporter of Independence, likely due to Lamberton's close ties with Bishop Wishart, who was a staunch supporter of Independence.G.W.S Barrow, Robert Bruce & The community of The Realm of Scotland, (Edinburgh, 1988), Pg 94 St Andrews was then the wealthiest and most powerful See in Scotland catapulting Lamberton straight into the highest circles in Scotland. The English would later charge Wallace with forcing the Chapter of Saint Andrews into electing LambertonPalgrave,Docs.Hist.Scot.,332,339. although evidence suggests that Lamberton was a popular candidate amongst the Chapter attracting the support of Nicholas Balmyle and William Comyn. He was consecrated in Rome on 1 June 1298, before joining other Scots on a diplomatic mission to France. Bishop Lamberton took a young James Douglas as his squire, Douglas' father William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas had joined the Scots during the First War of Independence and died while imprisoned by King Edward I. Lamberton protected Douglas and took him to court to petition unsuccessfully for the return of his estates. James Douglas later became one of the closest friends of Robert the Bruce. William Lamberton rebuilt St. Andrew's Cathedral, the castle of St Andrew's, and the fortified manor houses at Inchmurdo, Monimail, Dairsie, Torry, Muckhart, Kettins, Monymusk, Lasswade, and Stow.  Role in War of Independence  Upon becoming Bishop, Lamberton found himself in control of the diocese's vast funds; he used them to fund the war against England. He would also act as an important diplomat and envoy for Scotland. Lamberton remained a supporter of Scotland's independence and was even excommunicated for his role. = Diplomacy = When being consecrated as Bishop, Lamberton went to France to build support for Scotland in the French Court and Papal Curia. As early as June 1298 Lamberton had won victories for the Scottish cause; his activities led both the King of France Philip IV and Pope Boniface VIII to pressure Edward I to halt his attacks on Scotland. It led to Scotland's deposed king John Balliol being handed over into papal custody in 1299. In a letter to Scottish leaders dated 6 April 1299 Philip IV commended Lamberton's efforts and declared he would assist Scotland. Despite the Bishop's pleas, he did not send a military force to Scotland. Lamberton returned to France in 1301, and then in 1302, to keep pressing for France's support in the war. Lamberton clearly formed a bond with Philip - the French king intervened several times for Scotland. Bishop Lamberton's diplomatic abilities were later recognised by the Scottish Magnates when he was chosen as a third Guardian, alongside Robert Bruce and John Comyn in 1299. His role was to act as a third, senior, but neutral party between the two enemies. He would hold the position until 1301 and during his term he formed a close friendship with Bruce. = Wallace's man = Lamberton owed his position largely to the efforts of William Wallace who had been made sole Guardian of Scotland after the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 and as such Lamberton supported Wallace. Lamberton's clergy publicly denounced the English and supported Wallace. Lamberton ordered his Diocese's officials to divert Church funds to Wallace's campaign and urged Wallace to continue to fight England. After the defeat at Falkirk Wallace resigned the guardianship. Lamberton continued to support Scottish Independence. = Ties with Robert the Bruce = After forming close ties with Bruce during his time as Guardian, Lamberton saw him as a potential leader of a fight for independence. On 11 June 1304 Lamberton and Bruce formed a band \\"to resist prudently attacks by rivals...to be of one another's council in all their business and affairs at all times...without any deceit\\" This bond marked Bishop William's switch from supporting Balliol to Bruce. Both Lamberton and Bishop Wishart of Glasgow are said to have assured Bruce that should he make a move for Kingship they would not try to stop him. Bruce murdered the Red Comyn in the Greyfriars Church on 10 February 1306. Less than seven weeks later Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306. Lamberton and Wishart jointly conducted the coronation. Bruce was crowned again a few days later by Isabella MacDuff. Lamberton and Wishart were arrested and put in irons for their roles in Bruce's coronation and transported to London where they were imprisoned. \\"Only their Orders saved them from hanging.\\"Barrow, G.W.S., Robert Bruce & The community of The Realm of Scotland, (Edinburgh, 1988), p.153 Lamberton was later charged with treason against Edward. After Edward I's death Lamberton later swore fealty to his son Edward II promising to pursue the King's enemies, pay a ransom of ¬£6000 in instalments and remain within the boundaries of the See of Durham. Lamberton saw his oath to Edward II as a necessity and extorted from him under duress, and therefore invalid. During his time in England, Lamberton stayed near the Tweed so that he could maintain connections with the parts of his diocese under English rule. Lamberton also wrote a letter to Philip of France asking for the King to help him gain freedom from England. Lamberton attended negotiations in 1309 as an \\"English\\" envoy, and his skill as a diplomat helped him to keep on good terms with both Edward and Robert. Lamberton would never again collaborate with the English and Edward even attempted to have him ousted from the See of St Andrews in 1318 by writing letters to the Pope charging Lamberton with treason. However, Edward's efforts failed. = Excommunication and Reconciliation = Lamberton and three other bishops were summoned to Avignon to explain their actions, but chose to ignore by letters the summonses. Lamberton was excommunicated on 16 June 1320. King Robert, Lamberton and the Community of the Realm sent three separate replies to Pope John XXII; the last group's letter, now known as the Declaration of Arbroath, is the most famous, but it was a reply to Lamberton's letter which carried the news that any excommunication would be delayed until April 1321, giving Lamberton and the Scots time to reconcile themselves with the Papacy. Indeed, the letter did result in Scotland's reconciliation with Rome. Lamberton's and Robert I's bans of excommunication were lifted.  Death  Bishop William de Lamberton died on 20 May 1328, 18 days after England officially recognized that Scotland was a fully sovereign, independent state. He was buried on the north side of the high altar of St Andrews Cathedral on 7 June 1328.

Eukaryotic cells also produce M-CSF in order to combat intercellular viral infection. It is one of the three experimentally described colony-stimulating factors. M-CSF binds to the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor. It may also be involved in development of the placenta.  Structure  M-CSF is a cytokine, being a smaller protein involved in cell signaling. The active form of the protein is found extracellularly as a disulfide-linked homodimer, and is thought to be produced by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound precursors. Four transcript variants encoding three different isoforms (a proteoglycan, glycoprotein and cell surface protein) have been found for this gene.  Function  M-CSF (or CSF-1) is a hematopoietic growth factor that is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of monocytes, macrophages, and bone marrow progenitor cells. M-CSF affects macrophages and monocytes in several ways, including stimulating increased phagocytic and chemotactic activity, and increased tumour cell cytotoxicity. The role of M-CSF is not only restricted to the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage. By interacting with its membrane receptor (CSF1R or M-CSF-R encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene), M-CSF also modulates the proliferation of earlier hematopoietic progenitors and influence numerous physiological processes involved in immunology, metabolism, fertility and pregnancy. M-CSF released by osteoblasts (as a result of endocrine stimulation by parathyroid hormone) exerts paracrine effects on osteoclasts. M-CSF binds to receptors on osteoclasts inducing differentiation, and ultimately leading to increased plasma calcium levels‚Äîthrough the resorption (breakdown) of bone. Additionally, high levels of CSF-1 expression are observed in the endometrial epithelium of the pregnant uterus as well as high levels of its receptor CSF1R in the placental trophoblast. Studies have shown that activation of trophoblastic CSF1R by local high levels of CSF-1 is essential for normal embryonic implantation and placental development. More recently, it was discovered that CSF-1 and its receptor CSF1R are implicated in the mammary gland during normal development and neoplastic growth.  Clinical significance  Locally produced M-CSF in the vessel wall contributes to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. M-CSF has been described to play a role in renal pathology including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure. The chronic activation of monocytes can lead to multiple metabolic, hematologic and immunologic abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney failure. In the context of acute kidney injury, M-CSF has been implicated in promoting repair following injury, but also been described in an opposing role, driving proliferation of a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. As a drug target PD-0360324 and MCS110 are CSF1 inhibitors in clinical trials for some cancers.Interest Builds in CSF1R for Targeting Tumor Microenvironment See also CSF1R inhibitors.

The band formed in 1992 and disbanded in 2011, but reformed in 2013. History Skinless was formed by Ryan Wade and Noah Carpenter in the town of South Glens Falls, New York. After relocating to various New York towns and cities such as Saratoga, Clifton Park, and Cohoes, the band settled in Troy, New York. Skinless is known for its consistently intense performances, as well as for its lyrical mix of end-of-the-world cynicism and comedy, which at times satirizes well known death metal lyrics from bands such as Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, and death metal in general. These lyrical themes are demonstrated in songs such as \\"The Optimist\\", about a crumbling human society, and \\"Tug of War Intestines\\", which depicts children playing schoolyard games with a surgery patient's internal organs. The band has occasionally brought the \\"Skinless Girl\\" on stage and let her be roughed up, covered in fake blood, while the band performed. Earlier in the band's career, Skinless handed out long tubes of foam for the audience to beat each other while the band played. These tubes were nicknamed \\"The Logs of Brutality\\". Skinless's 1998 debut album, Progression Towards Evil, was an independent release which garnered the band high praise by fans and critics. In June 2010, Skinless played a reunion show with the line-up from the first 2 full-length albums. Guitarist Noah Carpenter wanted Skinless to continue in this formation but the band's \\"fire\\" was not there anymore. In April 2011, Skinless officially split up, but soon after announced a farewell performance at Maryland Deathfest 2011. All the members are continuing as musicians in other bands. Skinless reformed in 2013 with the original line up from Progression Towards Evil. The band then added a second guitarist, Dave Matthews. Skinless released a new album entitled Only the Ruthless Remain on June 2, 2015, their first since Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead in 2006.

It was written in 1864 and is now in the public domain. The title \\"Hanson Place\\" is a reference to the original Hanson Place Baptist Church in Brooklyn, where Lowry, as a Baptist minister, sometimes served. The original building now houses a different denomination. The music is in the key of D and uses an 8.7.8.7 R meter. An arrangement was also composed by Charles Ives, and a later arrangement is included in Aaron Copland's Old American Songs (1952) in addition to being used by American wind band composer David Maslanka in his Symphony No. 9 (2011). The song was sung live at the 1980 funeral of American Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.  Lyrics  The song's lyrics refer to the Christian concept of the anticipation of restoration and reward, and reference the motifs found at - a crystal clear river with water of life, issuing from the throne of heaven, all presented by an angel of God. Chorus : :Yes, we‚Äôll gather at the river, :The beautiful, the beautiful river; :Gather with the saints at the river :That flows by the throne of God. In popular culture =In film Westerns= The song was often employed in Western soundtracks, particularly those of director John Ford (being one of his favorite hymns) and it features in many of Ford's most famous films. The melody is played paradoxically in Stagecoach (1939), in the early scene is which Claire Trevor's character Dallas is run out of town. It also appears in Ford's Tobacco Road (1941), My Darling Clementine (1946), Three Godfathers (1948), Wagon Master (1950), twice in The Searchers (1956), and 7 Women (1966). The song is also heard in Gene Fowler, Jr.'s The Oregon Trail (1959) and in Elliot Silverstein's Cat Ballou (1965). It was used in the Sam Peckinpah films Major Dundee (1965) and also The Wild Bunch (1969) where it was employed as ironic counterpoint during an onscreen massacre. It was similarly put to use in such dark, late-period Westerns as 1968's Hang 'Em High and 1972's Jeremiah Johnson.Silva, Robert. Future of Classic, 2009-01-10.

A caricatural vocal rendition of the song (with new revival-style lyrics) is used for both a car chase and the end credits of Howard Morris' caper comedy, Who's Minding the Mint? (1967). It is also included in the film adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale (film). Part of the hymn was sung in the Academy Award-winning period film, Trip to Bountiful (1985).

International use In Sweden, the 1876 hymn to the same melody O, hur saligt att f√• vandra (\\"O, how blessed it is to walk\\") became one of the most popular songs of the widespread Swedish revivalist movement. A drinking song to the same melody, Jag har aldrig vart p√• snusen, partly mocking the religious message of the Swedish original, is one of the most popular drinking songs at Swedish universities. In Germany, the melody of the hymn became a well-known christmas carol named Welchen Jubel, welche Freude (\\"What rejoice, o what a joy\\") with the lyrics of Ernst Gebhardt (1832-1899).published in Frohe Botschaft in Liedern - song no. 17 (page 20) In 1937, the tune was adopted in Japan to a popular enka song Tabakoya no Musume („Çø„Éê„Ç≥„ÇÑ„ÅÆÂ®ò The Girl at the Tobacconist's). This enka song was soon parodied into juvenile song about the testicles of the tanuki („Åü„Çì„Åü„Çì„Åü„Å¨„Åç), which goes, \\"Tan-tan-tanuki's testicles: there isn't any wind, but [they still go] swing swing swing\\".

Several other variations also exist.  History  The Common Table Prayer was first published in the year 1753 in a Moravian hymnal, Etwas vom Liede Mosis, des Knechts Gottes, und dem Liede des Lammes, das ist: Alt- und neuer Br√ºder-Gesang. The title was Tisch-Gebetgen, or Table Prayer. There are possibilities that the prayer is from an older text with Lutheran origins. In the Moravian hymnal the prayer is not placed in the \\"Old Moravian Hymns\\" chapter or in the eighteenth-century Moravian hymns\\" chapter. Instead it is placed in the chapter titled \\"evangelical hymns from the seventeenth century\\". Dietrich Meyer put as author of the prayer \\"author unknown\\". In the Evangelisch-Lutherisher Gebets-Schatz or Evangelical-Lutheran Prayer Treasures, the prayer is attributed to Martin Luther, but this is highly speculated.  Text and Variations  Original German: :Komm, Herr Jesu; sei du unser Gast; :und segne, was du uns bescheret hast. English: :Come, Lord Jesus, be our Guest; :And bless what you have bestowed. or alternatively, a Moravian translation, :Come, Lord, Jesus, our Guest to be :And bless these gifts bestowed by Thee.

In 1906, Eugeni d'Ors coined the term following the Italian tradition of naming styles after the centuries (for example, Quattrocento, Cinquecento, etc.) and using the homonyms nou (nine) and nou (new) to suggest it was a renovation movement. The same year two essential works for Noucentisme were published: Els fruits saborosos by Josep Carner and \\"La nacionalitat catalana\\" by the Conservative politician Enric Prat de la Riba. In the arts Despite certain similarities between the movements, it opposed Modernisme, the previous movement, and the radical and individualist views and Bohemian lifestyle most of its proponents engaged in. Noucentisme glorified order and what they saw as the spirit of the 20th century and an idealist expectancy of change. The novel was largely excluded in favour of poetry, which was more useful to convey the spirit of the style. The style as a whole shows a predilection for a Classicist approach, Europeanism, Modernism and a struggle to perfect the literary style of language. Artists and politicians were close collaborators. Its main defining features in poetry are a return to Apollonian classicism, a very refined and accurate language, objectivity and rejection of abrupt feelings and a particular interest in nature. Its stylistical origins in the tradition started by Josep Torras i Bages, the Escola Mallorquina (\\"Majorcan School\\") led by the Conservative Joan Alcover and the priest Miquel Costa i Llobera, the French Parnassian poetry and the Symbolists are obvious in most of the works produced in the period that spans from 1906 to approximately 1923. The Vienna Secession was a key influence to their ideal of beauty in architecture. The architect Rafael Mas√≥ i Valent√≠ (1880-1935), works mainly in Girona and its regions, is one of the clearest promoters of nineteenth-century architecture. The architects of the first period, as Josep Maria Pericas mix and nineteenth-century modernist elements, especially in civil engineering. Its most prominent adherent, Josep Carner, known by his epithet of \\"prince of the Catalan poets\\" and produced very elaborate, ornate poetry, reminiscent of the Baroque and still admired for his beautiful style and refined language. In the following decades, though, the name of the movement has acquired a negative connotation of an excessively affected and artificial literature, just the opposite of Moderniste Joan Maragall's Romantic theory of \\"the living word\\", that is, spontaneity in creation. Painters and sculptors of the Noucentista period are Joaquim Sunyer, Joaqu√≠n Torres-Garc√≠a and Manolo Hugu√© (who was a close friend of Picasso). In politics \\"Aplicaciones del Gas\\" store in Barcelona by Santiago Marco (1930) Catalonia was the most industrialised and therefore wealthiest region of Spain at the time. A change of attitude towards politics among members of Catalan bourgeoisie helped develop the basis of political pragmatism and idealism in Noucentisme. Catalan nationalism was becoming seriously influential in politics for the first time, especially incarned in the right-wing and Catholic party Regionalist League, whose goal, despite having a full national conscience, was to achieve a number of reforms to reassure the hegemony of the Catalan principate within Spain and to become more influential in the decision-making in Spanish politics, instead of achieving formal independence. Following the disagreements that took place among Catalan politicians, intellectuals and, most prominently, the working class of Barcelona (after the \\"disaster\\" of 1898 and the Rif War, especially after what has come to be known as Semana Tr√†gica or Tragic Week in 1909), a segment of the population wished to disengage from Spain. The Catalan nationalist tradition in the 19th century had relied on protectionist views held by both the bourgeoisie and the working classes. On the other hand, an anti-liberal and reactionary Carlism that reclaimed its ancient rights and privileges still existed in the countryside and helped give birth, through Vigatanisme, to the emerging right-wing Catalanism. These new Noucentista views had partly assimilated and inherited these ideals, but were in favour of more modern values that represented their faith in (most probably far-fetched) idealist changes. A majority of members of the industrial bourgeoisie of the country supported the Regionalist League, which became the most influential party until about 1925. Now that they had been given the chance, intellectuals of Noucentisme (itself a vehicle of this conservative, Catholic Catalanism), led by Eugeni d'Ors, advocated a project of cultural intervention based on four principles: Imperialism, Arbitrarism, Civility, and Classicism. Noucentista imperialism was a conservative and up- to-date version of the principles of Spanish Regenerationism designed to make Catalonia the leading region of modernization of the Spanish state and society. Arbitrarism was a philosophy naming literary creation a symbol of human will conquering reality. Their particular will could be summed up as an \\"ideal Catalonia\\" that would come to replace the \\"real Catalonia\\" through the remaining two precepts, Civility and Classicism. Their concept of civility was rooted in a vision of an \\"ideal Catalonia\\" equalled to that of a Catalan polis ruled on the principles of culture, harmony, a democratic community life and order versus what they saw as the barbaric countryside. Their interest in an Apollonian Classicism was not only of a literary nature: they desired formal perfection, harmony and flawless proportion to be everywhere. Mediterraneity came to be seen as a synthesis of the Noucentista ideal. Their intervention in practice was carried out following three goals: * A reform of the country based on their ideology. * Orthographic reform of the Catalan language. * Editorial support and cultural infrastructures for the Catalan language. They chose Barcelona as the natural centre of all these institutional reforms. Their project was never completely fulfilled, among other reasons because of disagreements between members of Noucentisme, anti-catalanist repression under the 1923‚Äì1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and the consequent rise to popularity and power of left-wing Catalan nationalist and independentist parties. However, a large renovation of Catalan society took place, especially thanks to the reforms during the period of the Commonwealth of Catalonia and Catalan got its first consistent spelling rules with the reform led by Pompeu Fabra. They also promoted the creation of institutions in charge of the cultural and official development of Catalan. The Bernat Metge Foundation translated Greek and Latin language classics into Catalan and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans became a regulator body for Catalan. Also dating from the Noucentista era are other official institutions to promote culture and make it widely accessible were Network of Popular Libraries, the Catalan Drama School, the School of Librarians and the Library of Catalonia.

The term refers to the formal (morphe) aspect of the intellect (nous), in accordance with the theory of hylomorphism. The nature of the active intellect was the subject of intense discussion in medieval philosophy, as various Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers sought to reconcile their commitment to Aristotle's account of the body and soul to their own theological commitments. At stake in particular was in what way Aristotle's account of an incorporeal soul might contribute to understanding of the nature of eternal life.  Aristotle's conception  The idea is first encountered in Aristotle's De Anima, Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages (De Anima, Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25) by Joe Sachs, with some notes about the Greek: > ...since in nature one thing is the material (hulƒì) for each kind (genos) > (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it > is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of > them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it > is necessary in the soul (psuchƒì) too that these distinct aspects be > present; > the one sort is intellect (nous) by becoming all things, the other sort by > forming all things, in the way an active condition (hexis) like light too > makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors (to ph≈çs poiei ta > dunamei onta chr≈çmata energeiai chr≈çmata). > This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential > things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without > attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a being-at-work, for > what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a > governing source is above the material it works on. > Knowledge (epistƒìmƒì), in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it > knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, > in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time. > This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does > not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone > is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of > intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is > destructible), and without this nothing thinks. The passage tries to explain \\"how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does.\\" He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself., page 3 Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the intelligible forms of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors. The passage is often read together with Metaphysics, Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle also discusses the human mind and distinguishes between the active and passive intellects. In that passage Aristotle appears to equate the active intellect with the \\"unmoved mover\\" and God.See Metaphysics 1072b. Interpretations Sachs comments that the nature of the active intellect was \\"the source of a massive amount of commentary and of fierce disagreement\\"; elsewhere, chapter 5 of De Anima has been referred to as \\"the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy\\". As Davidson remarks: > Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - > terms not even explicit in the De anima and at best implied - and just how > he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the > history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly > the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of > the human soul or an entity existing independently of man. Greek The early Greek commentators on Aristotle, in particular Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, gave several different interpretations of the distinction between the active and passive intellects. Some of them regarded the active intellect as a power external to the human mind, Alexander going so far as to identify it with God. Later, both these interpretations, Neoplatonist ones, and perhaps others, influenced the development of an important Arabic language philosophical literature, using the term 'aql as the translation for nous. This literature was later translated into, and commented upon, in Latin and Hebrew. Jewish and Islamic Al-Farabi and Avicenna, and also the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, agreed with the \\"external\\" interpretation of active intellect, and held that the active intellect was the lowest of the ten emanations descending through the celestial spheres. Maimonides cited it in his definition of prophecy where > Prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by the Divine > Being through the medium of the Active Intellect, in the first instance to > man's rational faculty, and then to his imaginative faculty.Maimonides, > Guide for the Perplexed (translator: Michael Friedl√§nder), Dover: New York, > 1904, p. 225 The more strictly Aristotelian Muslims (in particular Avempace and Averroes) wrote about how one could conjoin oneself with the active intellect, thus attaining philosophical nirvana. The reason of the Islamic and Jewish Aristotelians for positing a single external Agent Intellect is that all (rational) human beings are considered by Aristotelians to possess or have access to a fixed and stable set of concepts, a unified correct knowledge of the universe. The only way that all human minds could possess the same correct knowledge is if they all had access to some central knowledge store, as terminals might have access to a mainframe computer . This mainframe is the Agent Intellect, the \\"mind\\" of the universe, which makes all other cognition possible. Western Christian In medieval and Renaissance Europe some thinkers, such as Siger of Brabant, adopted the interpretation of Averroes on every point, as did the later school of \\"Paduan Averroists\\". Thomas Aquinas elaborated on Aristotle's distinction between the active intellect and passive intellect in his Disputed Questions on the Soul and his commentary on Aristotle's De anima, arguing, against Averroes, that the active intellect is part of the individual human personality. A third school, of \\"Alexandrists\\", rejected the argument linking the active intellect to the immortality of the soul, while hastening to add that they still believed in immortality as a matter of religious faith. (See Pietro Pomponazzi; Cesare Cremonini.) The active intellect, in the sense described, is more properly called the Agent Intellect, as it is the force triggering intellection in the human mind and causing thoughts to pass from the potential to the actual. It must not be confused with the \\"intellect in act\\", which is the result of that triggering, and is more akin to the psychological term \\"active knowledge\\". Another term for the final result of intellection, that is to say a person's accumulated knowledge, is the \\"acquired intellect\\".

Aristotle's conception  Aristotle gives his most substantial account of the passive intellect (nous pathetikos) in De Anima (On the Soul), Book III, chapter 4. In Aristotle's philosophy of mind, the passive intellect \\"is what it is by becoming all things.\\"Aristotle, De Anima, Bk. III, ch. 5 (430a10-25). By this Aristotle means that the passive intellect can potentially become anything by receiving that thing's intelligible form. The active intellect (nous poietikos) is then required to illuminate the passive intellect to make the potential knowledge into knowledge in actuality, in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors. The analysis of this distinction is very brief, which has led to dispute as to what it means.  Interpretations  Greek thought While Greek commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius were broadly silent on the active intellect (debate over this would only become heated in the thirteenth-century Christian West in the context of debates over whether Avicenna or Averroes provided the account of the working of the intellect that best cohered with Christian doctrine), they provided a great deal of commentary on the nature of the passive intellect. For Alexander of Aphrodisias, for instance, (who coined the term of the 'material intellect' for this power, a name later taken up by Averroes), the passive intellect was a separate intellect from the active.Nicolas, S., Andrieu, B., Croizet, J.-C., Sanitioso, R. B., & Burman, J. T. (2013). Sick? Or slow? On the origins of intelligence as a psychological object. Intelligence, 41(5), 699‚Äì711. doi:10.1016/j.intell.2013.08.006 (This is an open access article, made freely available by Elsevier.) Averroes and Aquinas Later philosophers, including Averroes and St. Thomas Aquinas, proposed mutually exclusive interpretations of Aristotle's distinction between the active and passive intellect. Other terms used are \\"material intellect\\" and \\"potential intellect\\", the point being that the active intellect works on the passive intellect to produce knowledge (acquired intellect), in the same way that actuality works on potentiality or form on matter. Averroes held that the passive intellect, being analogous to unformed matter, is a single substance common to all minds, and that the differences between individual minds are rooted in their phantasms as the product of the differences in the history of their sense perceptions. Aquinas argues against this position in the Disputed Questions on the Soul (Quaestiones disputatae de Anima), and asserts that while the passive intellect is one specifically, numerically it is many, as each individual person has their own passive intellect. Passive intellect in Islamic philosophy Passive intellect is identical with Aql Bil Quwwah in Islamic philosophy. Aql bi-al-quwwah, defined as reason, could abstract the forms of entities with which it is finally identified. For Farabi, the potential intellect becomes actual by receiving the form of matter. In other words, Aql Hayulany tries to separate the forms of existents from their matter. The form become identical with Aql. Farabi also recognised the potential intellect as part of soul.

History and records Race co-founders Jim Butera, then-President of the Colorado Ultra Club, and Kenneth Chlouber, an avid marathon runner and town politician, conceived of the race as a way to bring visitors during a period of economic downturn.https://trailrunnermag.com/races/trail-race-news/leadville- trail-100-2013.html Leadville is one of the four 100-milers in the United States that make up the \\"Western Slam\\", completing four western events: the Leadville 100, the Western States 100 in northern California, the Wasatch Front 100 in Utah, and the Angeles Crest 100 in southern California. Leadville is also a part of the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning (the Vermont 100, Western States 100, Leadville and the Wasatch Front 100, originally Old Dominion 100 instead of Vermont) and an optional part of the Rocky Mountain Slam (Hardrock 100 plus three of four other races in the Rocky Mountains: Leadville, the Bear 100, the Bighorn 100, or the Wasatch Front 100). Leadville is also one of the valid qualifying events for the Western States 100. Leadville was the venue for the American debut of the Tarahumara runners of Mexico. In 1992 the Tarahumara first showed up to run outside their native environs. Wilderness guide Rick Fisher and ultra-runner Kitty Williams brought some of them to Leadville. However the experiment went bust. The problem, it turned out, was psychosocial, i.e. an unfamiliarity with the trail and the strange ways of the North. The Indians stood shyly at aid stations, waiting to be offered food. They held their flashlights pointed skyward, unaware that these \\"torches\\" needed to be aimed forward to illuminate the trail ahead. All five Tarahumara dropped out before the halfway point.Don Kardong in Runner's World, March 1995 v30 n3 p84(8) The Tarahumara teams came back in 1993 and 1994 and won the Leadville event outright both years. In 1993, 52-year-old Tarahumara runner Victoriano Churro came in first, followed by 41-year-old teammate Cerrildo in second. In 1994, a five-man Tarahumara team took on Ann Trason in a much- publicized race in the ultrarunning community. Twenty-five-year-old Tarahumara runner Juan Herrera won in a record time of 17:30. His mark stood for 8 years until broken by Chad Ricklefs in 2002 (17:23), then again by Paul DeWitt in 2004 and finally by current record holder Matt Carpenter's performance in 2005. Trason's time of 18:06 was good for second place overall, and is still the course record for female runners. =Notable Finishers= The winner of the first race in 1983 was Skip Hamilton of Aspen, CO., in a time of 20:11:18 Matt Carpenter is the current course record holder. His time of 15 hours and 42 minutes in 2005 shattered the previous Leadville Trail 100 record. The publisher of Colorado Runner magazine, Derek Griffiths, said afterwards, ‚ÄúIt was a perfect race for him. He finished in daylight, for crying out loud ‚Äî no one has ever done that before. I think he has just raised the bar of ultra racing to a whole new level.‚Äù Ann Trason holds the female LT100 record, 18:06:24, which she set in 1994. Trason is widely recognized as one of the greatest ultrarunners of all time, and nearly won the race outright in 1994. Charles Williams holds the record of the oldest man to ever complete the race, which he did at the age of 70 in 1999. He was featured in the August 1999 issue of GQ magazine, which compared his training for the race to that of a professional football player. Bill Finkbeiner became the first person ever to receive the \\"Leadville 2000-Mile Buckle\\" for twenty LT100 finishes in 2003. Finkbeiner has a total of 30 consecutive finishes, starting in 1984. In 2014, Kirk Apt finished his 20th Leadville 100. In 2019, Eric Pence finished his 25th Leadville 100, becoming the third person to earn 25 or more buckles, along with Finkbeiner and Garry Curry. Leadville Race Series The LT100 is one of six races presented under the Leadville Trail 100 banner. The other five events are as follows: * Leadville 10K Run: This is an open event the week before the main Trail 100 race, comprising the first and last portions of the full Trail 100 course. * Leadville Trail 100 MTB: This mountain bike race was added in 1994. The race was the idea of Tony Post, then a marketing vice president at the Rockport Company, sponsor of the event who arranged for television coverage for both races. The first mountain bike race drew just 150 entrants, while the 2009 edition allowed 1400 entrants. This USA Cycling- sanctioned race is held on a course that roughly parallels the LT100 run course, with some sections in common. It is held the same weekend as the 10K, and has attracted cyclists including Dave Wiens, Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. In 2010, Levi Leipheimer won the Leadville Trail 100 MTB in a then record time of 6:16:37, breaking the previous course record of 6:28:50 set in 2009 by Armstrong. The current course record is 5:58:35, set in 2015 by Alban Lakata. Howard Grotts, of Durango CO., has won the last three editions of the race, most notably in 2019 when a number of world tour road professionals competed in the race. * Silver Rush 50 MTB: This race is a USAC-sanctioned mountain bike race through the mining districts east of Leadville in late July. * Silver Rush 50 Run: This is a 50-mile trail run introduced in 2008 that follows the same route as the MTB course. The event occurs the day after the MTB event. Competitors who complete both Silver Rush events are recognized with a Silver Queen or Silver King award. * Leadville Trail Marathon: This is a marathon through the mining districts east of Leadville, is held in June each year. The midpoint of the course is at Mosquito Pass, with an altitude of . In 2006, a \\"heavy\\" half marathon event of 15 miles was added, which is run on the same day and also goes to the top of Mosquito Pass. A competitor who officially finishes the Trail 100 Run, Trail 100 MTB, the Marathon, the Silver Rush bike or run, and the 10K is called a \\"Leadman\\" or \\"Leadwoman\\", a title which nods to the Ironman Triathlon. Charles Bybee currently holds the most Leadman titles, with 10 years of finishing all events (2007-2010, 2012-2017). In 2015, Junko Kazukawa completed the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning and the Leadwoman series, becoming the first person to complete both events in a single year. All events of the 2020 edition of the race series were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given a deferral and a refund option for each race.https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/2020-lrs- cancellations-faq See also * Leadville Trail 100 MTB  References  External links * Leadville Race Series Trail 100 Run - Official website of the Leadville Trail 100 Mile * Complete Results at UltraSignup * CoolRunning.com.au - 1998 leadville race finish: The following is a short description of the incredible finish at the Leadville trail race by Keith Woestehoff', Kevin Tiller * SkyRunner.com - 'The Hammer: Carpenter nails Leadville 100 ‚Äì what‚Äôs next?'

It combines elements of the Walschaerts and Baker patterns. History Southern valve gear was devised by locomotive designers on the Southern Railway (US) and used on many locomotives on that line. The first patent was issued to Wm. Sherman Brown in 1906. He continued work and another patent was issued July 23, 1912. The gear was first tested on Mikado 586 in February, 1913 at Southern Knoxville Shops. It was specified for some USRA standard locomotive designs, though many locomotives constructed to these patterns used Walschaerts or Baker valve gear instead. The Southern valve gear was used on many Southern Railway locomotives, including survivors 630 and 722. It was also used on East Broad Top numbers 16-18, which survive today. Operation Unlike the Walschaerts and Baker systems, the Southern valve gear dispensed with the combination lever which transmitted some of the crosshead motion to the valves. As with those systems it used a return crank on a driver (instead of the eccentrics used by the Stephenson valve gear). The return crank attached to the eccentric rod, which hung from a pivot close to the far end of the eccentric rod. This pivot attached to the end of the radius hanger, the other end of which attached to a link block which slid back and forth in a track curved in the same manner as the expansion link of a Walschaerts gear. In this system, however, the track was fixed in place; sliding the link block back and forth controlled reversing and cutoff. At the end of the eccentric rod, close to the radius hanger, the rod connected to the transmission yoke. The upper end of this rod connected to a bellcrank, which translated the up and down motion of the transmission yoke into back and forth motion of the valves. The mechanism is a little less obvious than that of the other types, but control is fundamentally like that of the Baker system. In this case the controlling factor is the angle between the radius hanger and the transmission yoke; when they are parallel, there is little up-down motion of the transmission yoke and the engine is centered. As link block moves back and forth, the angle of the radius hanger changes, and the up and down motion of the transmission yoke in response to the back and forth motion of the eccentric rod is increased or decreased.

The Falabella, despite its size, is not considered a pony, but rather is a miniature horse. History The ancestral stock of the horse of South America descended from horses brought to the western hemisphere by the Spanish of Andalusian and other Iberian bloodlines. In the southern part of the continent, significant numbers of these horses developed within geographically isolated conditions and by the mid-19th century, there were any number of smaller, inbred animals in the herds of Mapuche of southern Buenos Aires province in Olavarr√≠a, Argentina.\\"Falabella miniature horse.\\" from International Museum of the horse The Falabella horse was originally developed in Argentina from local horses of Criollo stock, beginning in 1868 with the breeding program of Patrick Newtall. When Newtall died, the herd and breeding methods were passed to Newtall's son- in-law, Juan Falabella. Juan added additional bloodlines, including the Welsh Pony, Shetland pony, and small Thoroughbreds. With considerable inbreeding, he was able to gain consistently small size within the herd. Beginning in the 1940s, a descendant, Julio C. Falabella, created a formal breed registry, the Establecimientos Falabella, now the Asociaci√≥n de Criadores de Caballos Falabella (Falabella Horse Breeders Association), and worked to standardize the breed to reach a consistent height, first achieving an average size of under Later breeders developed the modern standard, a horse breed that averaged approximately in height. The first Falabella horses were imported to the United States In 1962, when John Aleno of Argentina sold 12 Falabella stallions to the Regina Winery in Etiwanda, California. Aleno had purchased the stallions from Julio Falabella. The winery used them to drive a small stagecoach in parades to promote their wine. Most of the Falabella miniature horses in the United States today descend from these 12 stallions.http://cruzminihorses.com/ Characteristics Average breed heights for a fully-grown Falabella today are between .Falabella Miniature Horse Association The breed is proportioned similarly to horses, other than in size. They are similar to Thoroughbreds or Arabs in their conformation, with a sleek coat and a slim frame. The Falabella‚Äôs body is small and compact. The breed also inherited some cob-like features from pony bloodlines, including sturdy bone, and a thicker hair coat, particularly the mane, tail and around the fetlocks. The head may be slightly larger and the neck is often stouter by comparison with a normal-sized horse, but overall, the animal is not unusually or abnormally proportioned. Bay (or a variant of bay, called \\"brown\\") and black are the most common colors, but there are also pintos, palominos and other spotting patterns found. Black or red leopard-spotted Falabellas (resembling, but not the same as the Appaloosa horse breed) also exist, but are not common. Falabella foals are very small, standing around tall at birth, and maturing to their adult height by the age of three. They generally stand between tall when fully mature. They are considered very hardy and consistently pass on size, conformation and temperament. Uses Most Falabellas are considered intelligent and easily trainable. Due to their size, Falabella horses can only be ridden by very small children, and thus are generally shown in-hand at horse shows. They can be taught to drive, and cart driving is a common use for Falabellas. They also jump obstacles up to , though in-hand, without a rider.Robinson, Richard I. \\"Falabella Miniature Horses.\\" Western Horseman, July, 1965.

While young horses may fetch steep prices and are even sold as a long-term investment, old horses are more readily available.

The five prisoners who took part in writing the Document were respectively affiliated with Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). The Document called for an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with al-Quds al-Shareef as its capital, and upholding the Palestinian right of return, both based on the UN Charter and international law. The Document also called for a reform of the PLO to enhance its representativity through the participation of all forces and factions, and for the election of a new Palestinian National Council before the end of 2006. President Mahmoud Abbas presented an ultimatum to Hamas to endorse the Document, which implicitly recognizes Israel, one of the key demands of the Road map for peace. He threatened to call a national referendum on the Prisoner's Document if Hamas would refuse. Abbas issued the referendum after Hamas had rejected his demands. A revised National Conciliation Document was negotiated and signed by all factions in June 2006 without being made essential changes to the text. The referendum did not take place. Israel denounced the Prisoners' Document, stating that it did not meet the requirements of the Roadmap most notably that it did not explicitly recognize Israel. Israel also took issue with the document's insistence on the right of return and the right to resist the occupation ‚Ä≥by various means‚Ä≥. Background The Prisoners' Document was written by leaders of the most important Palestinian factions, imprisoned in Israel. Prisoners of Israel have a high status within the Palestinian society. The Document was written in the context of a looming Palestinian civil war, amidst increasing factional fighting following Hamas' electoral victory and its entry into Parliament and Government. In the meantime, Israel's recently elected Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was seriously preparing his own \\"Convergence Plan\\", which envisioned a withdrawal of the occupation forces from some 90% of the West Bank, while annexing substantial parts including the large and expanded settlement blocs and East Jerusalem, with preservation of Israeli military control over the border zone at the Jordan River. After all, the civil war the prisoners wanted to prevent broke out a year later in the Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict.

Joel Greenberg, Chicago Tribune, 6 June 2006 Right after the formation of the Hamas-led PNA Government on 29 March 2006, President Abbas had started the building of a third security force under his own control to counter the various Hamas and Fatah militias. Around March/April 2006, Abbas, backed by the US, dispatched a unit of 150 members of his Presidential Guard to take over the control of the Rafah Border Crossing in southern Gaza. End May 2006, he aimed, with the support of US representative General Keith Dayton, to expand the Guard to 10,000 men in order to create an independent security force in Gaza under his full control as a counter to the various militias under Hamas and Fatah control. Also in May, a Fatah security official in the London Sunday Times accused Hamas of plotting to remove Abbas from power and told Palestinian security forces loyal to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas were planning an anti-Hamas push. He predicted that \\"Civil war is inevitable\\". In May 2006, indeed civil war-like armed clashes emerged. It was in this period that the Prisoners presented their paper.

The most radical faction, Islamic Jihad, expressed reservations on the clause pertaining to the negotiations. The Prisoners' Document The first version of the Prisoners' Document was written when the first Hamas-led PA Government, a government boycotted by Fatah, had been in power for 6 weeks and tensions between Fatah and Hamas were very high under pressure of international sanctions. The Document consists of 18 points. It calls for conciliation between the Palestinian factions, and development and reactivation of the PLO, based on the Cairo Declaration of March 2005. The Cairo Declaration sought reinforcement of the status of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people through the participation of all forces and factions to it according to democratic principles.Text of the 2005 Cairo Declaration, 19 March 2005.

Point 1 _of the first version_ reads: ‚Ä≥The Palestinian people in the homeland and in the Diaspora seek to liberate their land and to achieve their right in freedom, return and independence and to exercise their right in self-determination, including the right to establish their independent state with al-Quds al-Shareef as its capital on all territories occupied in 1967 and to secure the right of return for Palestinian refugees and to liberate all prisoners and detainees based on the historical right of our people on the land of the fathers and grandfathers and based on the UN Charter and the international law and international legitimacy.‚Ä≥ Point 2 recalls the 2005 Cairo Declaration about reform and reinforcement of the PLO as representative of \\"the Palestinian people wherever they are located\\". In order to achieve \\"development and activation of the PLO\\", Hamas and Islamic Jihad are explicitly mentioned to join the PLO. Point 2 also calls for a new Palestinian National Council through elections before the end of 2006 to represent \\"all Palestinian national and Islamic forces, factions and parties and all concentrations of our people everywhere\\". Point 3 states \\"the right of the Palestinian people in resistance and clinging to the option of resistance with the various means and focusing the resistance in the occupied territories of 1967 alongside with the political action and negotiations and diplomatic action and continuation of popular and mass resistance against the occupation in its various forms and policies...\\". Point 5 declares the Palestinian Authority ‚Ä≥the nucleus of the future state‚Ä≥ and stresses on respecting the laws and the responsibilities and authorities of the president and the government. Point 6 calls for \\"a national unity government on a basis that secures the participation of all parliament blocs, especially Fatah and Hamas ...\\". Point 7 recognizes negotiations adhering to national goals as mentioned in the document, and falling within the jurisdiction of the PLO and the President of the Palestinian Authority. Any agreement needs ratification by the newly elected National Council, or subjected to a general referendum to be held in the homeland and the Diaspora. Point 8 calls the liberation of the prisoners and detainees a sacred national duty. Point 9 demands the implementation of UN Resolution 194. Point 16 calls for a restructure of the security system, and organize its tasks towards both defending the homeland and confronting the aggression and the occupation and to maintain law and order within the Palestinian society.

BBC, 11 May 2006 On 25 May, the Document was discussed at a ‚Ä≥Palestinian National Dialogue Conference‚Ä≥, which was held by live video between Ramallah and the parliament building in Gaza City, because Hamas representatives based in Gaza were prohibited by Israel from traveling to the West Bank. At the Conference, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who had committed himself to the Road map for peace, tried to press Hamas to endorse within 10 days the Prisoners' Document with its implicit recognition of Israel by calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with al-Quds al-Shareef (East Jerusalem) as its capital.

On 5 June, Abbas declared that efforts to get support for the Prisoners' Document by the Hamas government had failed. He set a last ultimatum until midnight to accept the Document as it is, before calling a national referendum on the issue. Hamas said the group was ready to continue negotiations, but rejected the deadline set by Abbas.

After talks with Hamas failed; Abbas to call referendum on Prisoners Document. Saed Bannoura, IMEMC, 6 June 2006 According to a BBC journalist, Abbas was seeking to use the Prisoners' plan to strengthen his hand in his power struggle with the Hamas-led government and wanted to turn the referendum into a vote of confidence in himself - and a vote of no- confidence in Hamas. On 6 June, the PLO Executive Committee endorsed the Document and the referendum. The deadline for Hamas to agree was extended until the weekend. A poll in June showed that 77% of Palestinians supported the Prisoners' Document and 83% supported the creation of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders as stipulated in the Document.

Hamas-led PA parliament defers decision on Abbas' referendum. Avi Issacharof, Associated Press/Haaretz, 13 June 2006 Abbas declared that he would rescind his decree if negotiations with Hamas were successfully concluded before the referendum date. Had Hamas at this point chosen to endorse the Document, and were it to become the government‚Äôs platform, then Abbas would have had a hard job to sell it to Israel in negotiations and be forced to adopt positions with which he disagreed. Moreover, it would have been transformed from a potential bridge between Fatah and Hamas into another instrument in their power struggle. Hamas, however, chose to focus on the legality of the referendum and ignored the content, avoiding internal discussions. Also Israel objected to the plan, because it endorsed the right of return of Palestinian refugees and because it endorsed the Palestinian right to resist the occupation in areas occupied in the 1967 Six-day war. Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, said that the referendum is ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù because the vote cannot be a basis for negotiation. In Egypt, Jordan and Europe, instead, Olmert promoted his plan for an Israeli unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank.Olmert's mission. The Independent, 11 June 2006  Second version of the Document  Following Abbas' call for a referendum, the parties started negotiations on the text of the Document. By mid-June 2006, two Hamas MPs said that 98 percent of the disagreements over the plan had been ironed out. Fatah and Hamas representatives declared that an agreement on 15 out of the 18 points in the Document had been reached. There remained differences, however, on the issues of the exclusive status of the PLO in negotiations with Israel, the right of the Palestinian people for armed resistance within the borders of the occupied territories, and the question of holding a referendum on future agreements with Israel. Meanwhile, frequent armed clashes between Fatah and Hamas took place in the streets of Gaza.Fatah, Hamas Reach Agreement on Division of Security Forces. Avi Issacharoff and Shlomi Shamir, Haaretz, 18 June 2006 On 28 June, the re-negotiated version was signed by Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad Movement, PFLP, and DFLP, whereby Islamic Jihad expressed reservations on the clause pertaining to the negotiations.Hamas takes step to recognise Israel.

Instead, the PLO should achieve ‚Ä≥the participation of all forces and factions to it according to democratic principles that reinforce the status of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people wherever they are in a manner that meets with the changes on the Palestinian arena and in a manner that consolidates the authority of the PLO to assume its responsibilities in leading our people in the homeland and the Diaspora.‚Ä≥ Furthermore, it proposes ‚Ä≥elections, where possible, according to proportional representation, and through agreement where it is not possible to hold elections‚Ä≥. *Point 5 adds: ‚Ä≥and stress on the importance and need for creative cooperation between the presidency and the government‚Ä≥. *Point 6 no longer calls for ‚Ä≥a national unity government on a basis that secures the participation of all parliament blocs, especially Fatah and Hamas and the political forces that desire to participate on the basis of this document‚Ä≥, but instead, for ‚Ä≥a national unity government that secures the participation of parliamentary blocs and political forces interested in participating on the basis of this document‚Ä≥. *Point 7 states that referendums about negotiations agreements, if held, explicitly involve the Diaspora. *Point 11 seeks to enhance democracy by adding: ‚Ä≥and to stress on the principle of separation of authorities‚Ä≥.  Consequences  With the signing of the Prisoners' Document, the political leadership of all factions in the Palestinian territories, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, had implicitly recognized Israel and explicitly accepted a Palestinian state within the pre-1967 boundaries, based on the UN Charter and international law, and Hamas agreed with peace negotiations and diplomacy conducted by the PLO, provided that Hamas was admitted into the organisation (as the document was put forth as a complete package: \\"the participation of all forces and factions\\"). Hamas refused, however, to explicitly recognize Israel and forswear armed resistance within the occupied territories. This lead Israel to denounce the document, calling it a ‚Ä≥stepping away from peace‚Ä≥. On 29 June 2006, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote on its website: ‚Ä≥The objective behind this document had nothing to do with advancing prospects for peace with Israel ... The document fails to meet the requirements of the Roadmap and the three basic conditions of the Quartet: recognition of Israel's right to exist, ending terrorism, and adherence to all existing agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ... Explicitly supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state within all the territories \\"occupied since 1967\\" does not mean recognition of Israel.‚Ä≥The Palestinian \\"Prisoners' Document\\": Stepping away from peace-A Text Analysis. Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 29 June 2006 Most Palestinians supported the Document.  Olmert's \\"convergence plan\\"  While the Palestinians were discussing the Prisoners' Document, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pushed his so-called \\"convergence plan\\" or realignment plan, a plan for partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel would solidify its control of large settlement blocs and unilaterally draw its border with the Palestinians, if there was no breakthrough in peace efforts were to come. On 4 May 2006, Olmert had already presented the plan before the Knesset after being approved by the Israeli Government. A \\"convergence committee\\" had been installed to prepare a detailed draft plan. The plan drew staunch opposition worldwide and when the Prisoners' Document was published and discussed, Olmert said that he would be \\"willing to devote 6 to 9 months to find a Palestinian partner\\" before turning to his unilateral plan. At the same time, however, he approved expansions of settlement boundaries for the first time in years. He also said that not all \\"scattered settlements\\" would be dismantled and relocated. On 23 June 2006 US President George W. Bush hailed Olmert's plans, although he said that a negotiated agreement \\"best serves Israelis and Palestinians and the cause of peace.\\"  Gaza-Israel conflict  The implications of the document were overshadowed by the abduction of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit on June 25, during the 2006 Gaza cross-border raid in which Hamas militants entered Israel through hidden tunnels. In response, Israel threatened to invade Gaza unless Gilad was returned. Under international pressure, President Abbas assured Israeli intelligence that efforts were underway to secure the release of Gilad. On 28 June, Israel began Operation Summer Rains, an invasion of Gaza with the stated goals to rescue Gilad and to end rocket fire into Israel. International attention was led away from the Prisoners' Document and focused on the invasion, which lasted until the end of November.Monthly media monitoring review, July 2006. UN Division for Palestinian RightsICRC gravely concerned about humanitarian situation in Gaza. International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 13 July 2006  Aftermath  Hamas had hoped, it would afford international recognition of the PA government. Hope that soon would turn out to be idle. The international community continued its boycott of the elected PA government and maintained its sanctions against the Palestinians. The referendum issued by Abbas was never held. After the signing of the revised Prisoners‚Äô Document, instead, Fatah and Hamas started negotiations on a unity government. On 11 September 2006, President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh reached a tentative agreement to form a government of national unity. They agreed that the new government should be based on the Prisoners‚Äô Document.The Arab-Israeli Conflict: To Reach a Lasting Peace , p. 2-4 and p. 27 (Appendix D: The Abbas-Haniya Accord).

AP, 11 September 2006 The PFLP expressed its willingness to participate in the coalition government.Abbas and Haniyeh Agree on Coalition. Xinhua News Agency, 12 September 2006 On 20 September, the Palestinian daily al-Ayyam published the text of the agreement, called ‚Ä≥Program for a new government‚Ä≥, consisting of 7 points. The accord states that the government will ‚Ä≥respect‚Ä≥ the agreements signed by the PLO, and support plans based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. While the Arab Peace Initiative stipulates the recognition of Israel in exchange for inter alia a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, an explicit recognition is absent in the Abbas-Haniyeh Accord itself. The latter reiterates the mainpoints of the Prisoners‚Äô Document, and for the first time, Hamas recognizes the peace agreements between the PLO and Israel. The Abbas- Haniyeh draft agreement met with objections from some Hamas leaders over the mentioning of the Arab Peace Initiative, which they saw as tantamount to recognition of Israel. They insisted on replacing the Peace Initiative with the term ‚Ä≥Arab legitimacy‚Ä≥. The opposition escalated when Abbas in a speech before the UN General Assembly on 21 September claimed that the program for a new government was strictly in line with the Quartet conditions (commitment to the principles of nonviolence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap).Quartet Statement London, 30 January 2006. un.orgAbbas makes Israel recognition pledge.

Amidst inter-factional violence, Abbas issued on 16 December 2006 a call for early parliamentary and presidential elections. Saeb Erekat, however, said the Palestinian Basic Law, which acts as a constitution, has no provision for calling early elections. Hamas was displeased and accused Abbas of launching a coup.Abbas calls for early Palestinian poll. Reuters, 16 December 2006 While the Fatah‚ÄìHamas fightings continued, the negotiations on a unity government stagnated until on 8 February 2007, the Saudi-brokered Fatah‚ÄìHamas Mecca Agreement paved the way to the short-lived Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007. The Mecca Agreement called for the end of Palestinian bloodshed, a Palestinian national unity government, activation and reform of the PLO, and respecting the effective laws of the PA. The unity government was again led by Ismail Haniyeh, but yet supported by Fatah. However, it still failed to get the support of Israel as well as the international community. Attempts to form a single security force resulted in a struggle for power between Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. Fighting between militants and forces of Fatah and Hamas escalated. Eventually, Hamas violently took over Fatah-controlled security headquarters and sites in the Gaza Strip on 14 June 2007.

The two teams first played each other in 1892, and the rivalry has been renewed annually since 1944 for a total of 125 games as of 2020. Because it is the oldest rivalry still contested between teams in the Deep South, the series is referred to by both schools as the \\"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\\". The series is currently the second-most played rivalry in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), behind Minnesota-Wisconsin (Paul Bunyan's Axe) and tied with Cincinnati-Miami University (Battle for the Bell) and North Carolina-Virginia (South's Oldest Rivalry). The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry is eight months older than the South's Oldest Rivalry, with Auburn-Georgia first meeting on February 20, 1892 and North Carolina-Virginia first meeting on October 22, 1892. The Auburn- Georgia series has been played almost continuously from the beginning, with the exception of 1893 (rematch not scheduled), 1897 (Georgia disbanded its team early in the season following the fatal on-field injury of one of its players), 1917 and 1918 (Georgia did not field teams during World War I), and 1943 (Auburn did not field a team due to World War II). The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry and the South's Oldest Rivalry were tied from 1910-1942 until North Carolina-Virginia surpassed Auburn-Georgia in 1943 (though North Carolina-Virginia continued to trail Southern rivalry Texas‚ÄìTexas A&M; by two games). Conference realignments in the early 2010s ended several prominent rivalries, allowing North Carolina-Virginia (in 2014) and Auburn-Georgia (in 2015) to surpass Kansas‚ÄìMissouri and Texas‚ÄìTexas A&M;, giving North Carolina- Virginia the undisputed lead as most-played rivalry in the South and tied with Cincinnati-Miami of Ohio for the second-most played rivalry in the FBS. They would soon be joined by Auburn-Georgia in 2017 after the SEC foes played twice in the same season - once in the regular season and again in the conference championship game. Series history The first college football game between Auburn University and the University of Georgia was played on February 20, 1892, in Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was the brainchild of Charles Herty of Georgia and George Petrie of Auburn, the founders and first head coaches of their respective university's football teams. The two had met as graduate school classmates at The Johns Hopkins University. The game was also, according to legend, when Auburn's team cheer, \\"War Eagle\\", originated. Auburn won the game 10‚Äì0. The Tigers and Bulldogs have played each other nearly every year since. There have only been three exceptions since 1898, when World War I and World War II interrupted the series. Through the 2018 season, the rivalry is tied for the second most played college football series at 123 games, and is led by Georgia 61‚Äì56‚Äì8. When the Southeastern Conference split into its Eastern Division and Western Division in 1992, with Auburn placed in the west and Georgia in the east, the game was designated as the teams' annual cross-divisional rivalry game, leaving open the possibility for the two teams to meet in the SEC Championship Game. This happened for the first time in 2017, when Georgia beat Auburn 28‚Äì7 to claim their 13th SEC championship. This championship game matchup tied the rivalry with the South's Oldest Rivalry between Virginia and North Carolina for the 2nd most played rivalry game in FBS football. Game results  Notable games  1895 Auburn-Georgia game at Piedmont Park. In 1892, The two schools met in the first meeting in what is now the Deep South‚Äôs oldest college football rivalry. Auburn won the game 10‚Äì0. One Atlanta newspaper called it the ‚Äúsocial event of the year.‚Äù In 1896, Georgia won by a 12‚Äì6 score to finish its first undefeated season under Pop Warner. For Auburn, the game featured Reynolds Tichenor's brilliant punt returns. In 1899, by all accounts Auburn was leading Georgia by a score of 11-6 when the game was called due to darkness, lighting not being available at that time, resulting in an official 0-0 tie. As noted by sideline reporters for The Atlanta Constitution \\"The conditions that appeared to make the ruling of Referee Rowbotham a necessity were such as should never have occurred on any gridiron that has the advantage of police protection. As darkness came on it was impossible in the bleachers and grand stand to distinguish the play and with no obstacle in the way the crowd surged into the field mingled with the players and made further progress a matter of impossibility.\\" Fifteen minutes prior to the decision, Auburn coach, John Heisman, and Georgia Coach, Gordon Saussy, made an official request to call the game for the same reason. The decision was backed by Umpire Taylor. \\"In the decision that made the game a tie the referee was backed up by Umpire Taylor of Birmingham who, although a Just official has always been regarded by many as a friend of Auburn.\\" In 1902, Rufus Nalley dies in Atlanta after a short, serious illness. According to some, the last thing that he heard before losing consciousness on November 27, was that Georgia had beaten Auburn earlier that day, news that caused him to smile. It was the first victory for Georgia in the rivalry since the 1896 team for which Nalley played. In 1916, Auburn won 3‚Äì0 in the mud on a 40-yard field goal in the fourth quarter by Moon Ducote kicked off of teammate Legare Hairston's leather helmet, in Columbus's McClung Stadium. This precipitated the rule which states the ball must be kicked directly off the ground.Loyola Director, Dick Ducote, Dies, The Milwaukee Journal, March 26, 1937. In 1920 Georgia upset Auburn 7‚Äì0 when Auburn was fresh off a 56‚Äì6 beatdown of Vanderbilt. In 1942, Georgia won the national championship with an 11‚Äì1 record, beating UCLA in the 1943 Rose Bowl, Georgia's lone loss came to Auburn, falling 27‚Äì13 at Columbus's Memorial Stadium. On November 14, 1959, at Sanford Stadium in Athens, as time ran short, Georgia player and future Auburn head-coach Pat Dye recovered a fumble by Auburn quarterback Bryant Harvard. Georgia quarterback Fran Tarkenton's touchdown pass in the final seconds gave Georgia a 14‚Äì13 victory and cost Auburn a Southeastern Conference championship. Georgia went on to claim the 1959 SEC Championship and the 1960 Orange Bowl Championship with a victory over Missouri in Miami. In 1983, again at Sanford Stadium, Pat Dye celebrated his first SEC championship as Auburn's coach after the Tigers beat Georgia 13‚Äì7 on November 12. Georgia coach Vince Dooley, a former star Auburn quarterback, was there too on that day in 1959 as an assistant on Shug Jordan's staff. In 1986, the Bulldogs visited Auburn as three-touchdown underdogs. Auburn was two wins away from the SEC Championship, with only one blemish on their record, an 18‚Äì17 setback at Florida. Georgia, deprived of starting quarterback James Jackson at the last moment due to a family funeral, staged a 20‚Äì16 upset victory. When Georgia fans stormed the field of Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium and started tearing the turf from midfield and refused to leave, they were doused by sprinkler system and fire hoses. The hoses were quickly turned on the stands, soaking the Georgia marching band and fans listening to its traditional post-game performance. The incident received widespread attention and Auburn officially apologized. In 1994, Georgia ended Auburn's 20-game winning streak with a 23‚Äì23 tie at Jordan-Hare. The Sunday morning headline in nearby Columbus, Ga read \\"UGA beats Auburn 23‚Äì23\\". In 1996, the two teams played in the first Southeastern Conference football game to go into overtime. First-year head coach Jim Donnan's team was down 28‚Äì7 at halftime, before rallying to tie it at 28 on a 30-yard touchdown as time expired from Mike Bobo to Cory Allen, and Georgia went on to win 56‚Äì49 in four overtimes. This game was also famous for the incident in which Uga V lunged at Auburn wide receiver Robert Baker after a first-quarter touchdown. In 1999, Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville got his first signature win, as the underdog Tigers led 31‚Äì0 at halftime and cruised to a 38‚Äì21 victory. In 2001, #19 Georgia had a chance to force overtime after getting possession back at the Auburn 45-yard line with 1:10 remaining and no timeouts. The Bulldogs drove down to the goal line with 16 seconds left, but rather than spiking the ball to save time off the game clock, they inexplicably called for a handoff up the middle for no gain. Time expired before Georgia was trying to hurry up on offense, and the Bulldogs lost to the #24 Tigers 24‚Äì17. In 2002, #7 Georgia traveled to #22 Auburn with a spot in the SEC Championship game and an outside chance at the national title on the line. Auburn led 14‚Äì3 at halftime, thanks to a 53-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Brown. Georgia rallied to make it 21‚Äì17 Tigers with 1:25 remaining when they faced a 4th and 15 from the Auburn 19. QB David Greene threw up a prayer, and Michael Johnson caught the pass over Auburn CB Horace Willis to come away with the improbable touchdown. Georgia defeated Auburn 24‚Äì21 to secure a spot in their first SEC Championship Game. The Bulldogs defeated Arkansas 30‚Äì3 to win their first SEC Championship since 1982. The Bulldogs finished the season 13‚Äì1 with a victory over Florida State in the Sugar Bowl, and a #3 final ranking. In 2004, #8 Georgia traveled to undefeated and #3 Auburn in 2004. The Tigers were eyeing their first SEC Championship since splitting the title in 1989 (note: Auburn was on probation in 1993 and ineligible for the championship), as well as a spot in the BCS National Championship Game. The Tigers won 24‚Äì6 on their way to a 13‚Äì0 season, ending with a 16‚Äì13 victory over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl and a No. 2 national ranking. In 2006, #5 Auburn had hopes of playing for a National Championship after knocking off eventual champion Florida, but due in large part to the performance of free safety, Tra Battle who tied a Georgia record that day with three interceptions, one of which he returned 30 yards for a touchdown. UGA would go on to rout the Tigers 37‚Äì15, dashing their title hopes and costing Tommy Tuberville and company a shot at playing for the SEC Championship Game. In 2007, the game marked the first time in the modern era that Georgia wore black jerseys. It also marked the first time that Georgia defeated Florida and Auburn in the same season since 1982 , and the first time that Georgia scored more than 40 points in three straight games since 1942. In 2013, #7 Auburn hosted #25 Georgia in Auburn. Through the first 50 minutes of the game, Auburn had scored on seven of nine possessions with 29 first downs building a 37‚Äì17 lead. In contrast, when Georgia began their first possession of the fourth quarter they had only reached the end zone once on their previous six drives. Auburn maintained that 20-point lead until 9:35 left in the game when the momentum suddenly shifted in Georgia's favor. At that moment, Aaron Murray threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to senior Rantavious Wooten to cut the deficit to 13 points. In fact Murray would lead his team to three touchdowns in the span of 7:46, the final touchdown giving Georgia their first lead of the game with 1:49 remaining. With 36 seconds remaining and faced with 4th and 18 from the Tiger 26-yard line, Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall, a former defensive back for the Bulldogs during the 2011 season, threw a Hail Mary pass, which was tipped by Georgia safety Josh Harvey-Clemons into the hands of Auburn sophomore wide receiver Ricardo Louis. What has become known as \\"The Prayer at Jordan‚ÄìHare,\\" the play resulted in a game-winning touchdown for the Tigers with 25 seconds to spare. Auburn went on to win the SEC Championship and later barely lost the BCS National Championship in the final seconds to Florida State. This was the first time an SEC team failed to win the BCS Championship game since the 2005 football season. In 2014, the Bulldogs avenged their loss from the year before by handily beating the Tigers 34‚Äì7 in Athens. Auburn scored first and took a 7‚Äì0 lead, but the Bulldogs came back with 34 unanswered points. Bulldogs running back Nick Chubb, in his freshman season, ran the ball 19 times for 144 yards and 2 touchdowns for the Bulldogs. Georgia outgained the Tigers in total yards 412‚Äì292 and Auburn committed 3 turnovers in the game. The loss effectively ended the Tigers hopes for a second straight National Championship Game appearance. However, the Bulldogs would lose star running back Todd Gurley to a knee injury during the game. It was later revealed that Gurley had torn his ACL, ending his season and college career. In 2017, the two teams met twice in a single season for the first time in history. The first matchup occurred on November 11 in Georgia's only regular season loss, where the #1 Bulldogs lost 40‚Äì17 at #10 Auburn. A rematch took place in the 2017 SEC Championship Game in Atlanta, where #6 Georgia got revenge by beating #2 Auburn 28‚Äì7 and winning the SEC championship, securing a College Football Playoff spot in the process.  Family rivalry  Beyond the length of the rivalry, the schools' football histories are quite interconnected, with many individuals having played or coached at both schools. Georgia's all-time winningest head coach and long- time athletic director, Vince Dooley, earned both his bachelor's and master's degree at Auburn while playing football and subsequently beginning his coaching career under legendary Auburn head coach Shug Jordan. Jordan himself was an assistant football coach and head basketball coach at Georgia before returning to his alma mater. Former Auburn head coach Pat Dye was a three-year letterman and All-American offensive lineman at Georgia under head coach Wally Butts. About the rivalry, Dye has said, \\"It's a unique thing. It's like playing against your brother. I don't think anybody who plays in that game can ever forget it. It just doesn't matter much where it's played or what somebody's record is. It's so intense and tough, but at the same time, it's family.\\" Current Auburn associate head coach and defensive line coach Rodney Garner previously coached at Georgia for fifteen years (1998‚Äì2012). Garner and former Georgia offensive line coach Stacy Searels both played at Auburn under Dye. Former Georgia offensive coordinator Neil Callaway was Auburn's offensive line coach for all of Dye's 12 seasons. Two-time former Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp and offensive line coach Hugh Nall are former Georgia players. Tracy Rocker, a College Football Hall of Fame inductee and two-time All-American at Auburn as a defensive lineman, was a defensive line coach at Georgia from 2014‚Äì2017 after holding the same position at Auburn from 2009‚Äì2010.

They provide children with age-appropriate preparation for medical procedures, pain management and coping strategies, and play and self- expression activities. They also provide information, support, and guidance to parents, siblings, and other family members. Association of Child Life Professionals Programs and Services ACLP organizes professional development opportunities for child life specialists, including the ACLP Annual Conference on Professional Issues, and facilitates the exchange of knowledge and resources through face-to-face networking and online learning communities.

History The Association for Child Life Professionals traces its origins to the Association for the Care of Children in Hospitals (ACCH), which was founded in 1967 by a group of early child life workers, who recognized the need for a large, multidisciplinary organization to effect positive change in hospital environments for children and families. ACCH membership included doctors, nurses, child life specialists, parents and other health professionals working with children and families. In 1974, a Child Life Study Section was created within ACCH to help the child life profession achieve a separate identity, and to continue defining the theoretical basis of child life specialists‚Äô work with children, the essential elements of professional practice, and educational requirements. After an ad hoc Committee on Structure for Child Life Professional Issues recommended the formation of a separate professional organization for child life specialists, in 1982, the Child Life Council was founded with separate officers and its own professional development conference. In 1983, CLC had 235 founding members. A professional credentialing program was established in 1986. Over the next two decades, child life programs and CLC membership continued to grow, as the organization developed a variety of professional resources and official documents, including standards of educational preparation, requirements of professional competency, standards of clinical practice, and program review and development tools.\\"History of ACLP\\", from www.childlife.org, retrieved June 5, 2018 As of 2012, the Child Life Council had approximately 5,000 members.‚ÄúAbout ACLP‚Äù, from www.childlife.org, retrieved March 15, 2012 As part of its 2015-2018 strategic plan, the Child Life Council undertook a process to rebrand in an effort to position the organization and its members for greater success.

It featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock, and Jessica Simpson. The halftime show was produced by MTV and was focused the network's Choose or Lose campaign (the year 2004 was a presidential election year in the United States). Immense controversy arose from an incident during the show in which Janet Jackson's breast ‚Äì adorned with a nipple shield;‚Äì was exposed by Justin Timberlake. Background and development In 2002, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI; however, the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's \\"Choose or Lose\\" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote. Prior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him. While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster Velvet Rope World Tour, which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide. While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's \\"Overjoyed\\". Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became \\"good friends\\", with Jackson also praising Timberlake. Timberlake recreated Jackson's \\"That's the Way Love Goes\\" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style. When asked who he thought was \\"the sexiest woman on the planet\\", Timberlake had said \\"I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.\\" Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on \\"(And She Said) Take Me Now\\", a song from his debut solo album Justified. AOL Topspeed spent $10 million to sponsor the halftime show. Later recounting of the acoustics in the stadium during the performance, the performance's sound engineer Patrick Baltzell would recount, ‚ÄúIt was a disaster. Super Bowl Sound: When the World is Watching. You couldn‚Äôt understand a single lyric.‚Äù The shape of Reliant Stadium and its P.A. system produced a muffled sound, and stadium ownership as well as the NFL refused to allow Baltzell to play temporary speakers in locations that might block any fan's view of the stadium's video screens. Synopsis The performance was preceded with a video montage encouraging people to vote. The montage featuring celebrities such as Beyonc√©, Tony Hawk, Jennifer Lopez, Elijah Wood, Chris Rock, Julia Roberts, Muhammad Ali, Jay-Z, Tom Cruise and others declaring things people can \\"choose\\", concluding with a urging that viewers choose to vote. The performance then began with a brief introduction by Jessica Simpson who shouted, \\"Houston, choose to party\\". This was followed by a joint performance of \\"The Way You Move\\" by the marching bands Spirit of Houston, from the University of Houston, and the \\"Ocean of Soul\\" of Texas Southern University Jackson then took stage to perform \\"All for You\\". At the start of the song, she descended in a stage elevator. Following this, light dimmed and P. Diddy took stage on a secondary stage, located elsewhere on the field, emerging from a cloud of stage fog. He proceeded to perform \\"Bad Boy for Life\\". He was then joined by cheerleaders who perform a version of the song \\"Mickey\\", which substituted \\"Diddy\\", and later \\"Nelly\\", for \\"Mickey\\". Nelly then entered in a car, joining Diddy on stage to perform \\"Hot in Herre\\", during which the cheerleaders proceed to remove articles of their clothing. Following this, Diddy performed \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\". Following this, Kid Rock took stage on yet another secondary stage, located elsewhere on the field, and performed \\"Bawitdaba\\" followed by \\"Cowboy\\". He did so wearing an American Flag as a poncho. Jackson then took stage on the main stage again performing \\"Rhythm Nation\\" with the song's music video choreography. She donned mostly the same outfit she had during \\"All for You\\", with some differences, such as different skirt than before. Timberlake joined her, and performed \\"Rock Your Body\\" with her, at the end of which song he tore off a part of her top revealing her breast (baring a nipple shield). The show ended with voiceovers, again, declaring things to \\"choose\\", including getting involved.

The murder  John Edward Swindler shot and killed Patrolman Randy Basnett in the afternoon of September 24, 1976. Officer Basnett had stopped at a service station at the Kelly Highway exit in Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Swindler also stopped there in a stolen car with a South Carolina license plate. Swindler was returning to Leavenworth, Kansas to settle some personal grudges that had arisen when he had been imprisoned there. Passing the I-540 exit on I-40 near Van Buren, Arkansas, the illiterate Swindler became confused and exited, driving across the Arkansas River and into Fort Smith. That morning, Basnett had been briefed to be on the lookout for Swindler, who was the suspect in the double murders of teenagers Gregory L. Becknell and Dorothy Ann Rhodes in South Carolina and other felonies in Georgia and South Carolina. The briefing contained information about Swindler's description, the car he was thought to be driving, and the fact that he was considered to be armed and dangerous. After he noted Swindler and the stolen car, Basnett radioed dispatchers that Swindler was at the service station. Back-up officers were immediately dispatched to his location. Before additional help arrived, officer Basnett approached Swindler's car and asked for identification. Without warning, Swindler pulled a revolver and shot Basnett twice in the chest. Basnett, who was standing beside the car, returned fire before collapsing, slightly wounding Swindler. Swindler attempted to flee, but being unfamiliar with Fort Smith, took a road that trailed off into a dead end in a soybean field on the Arkansas River. He was captured there within minutes by police officers who had answered Basnett's call. When officers arrested Swindler, he had several weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his possession. Basnett died in the ambulance on the way to Sparks Regional Medical Center.  Execution  A legislative act in 1983 made lethal injection the only method of execution in Arkansas. However, inmates who had been sentenced to death before the legislation was adopted were allowed to choose between lethal injection and electrocution. When Charles Laverne Singleton chose lethal injection, John Edward Swindler earned the distinction of being the last inmate to die in Arkansas' electric chair. Swindler refused to choose between lethal injection and the electric chair, according to the Arkansas Department of Correction. By not choosing, Swindler effectively selected electrocution. Warden David White said Swindler might have wanted the notoriety of being the last Arkansas inmate to die in the electric chair. His was also the only execution in the new electric chair constructed by the state in the 1970s. Swindler was the first person executed by the state of Arkansas since Furman v. Georgia, , after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas and that came into force on March 23, 1973. After the Swindler execution, electrocution was made available to inmates who chose it. Further legislation stipulated that electrocution is authorized, but only if lethal injection is found unconstitutional.

He is best known as lead guitar player and songwriter for Marky Ramone & the Speedkings. Career Jaywalker started his career as a punk rocker in the late 1970s, releasing a first single \\"Tropical Stumble\\" with Organized Pleasure in 1980. The single immediately became a radio hit and stayed in the charts for 10 weeks. His work with Definitivos gave Jaywalker his first major break in the Belgian punk scene. After putting out several records from 1980 to 1985, Definitivos became The Whydads and released a full album in 1988 before calling it quits in 1989. A couple of Definitivos singles later appeared on the Bloodstains Compilations. From then on, Jaywalker performed with many bands, most notably The Midnight Men, Goldengalaxyjerks and Faroutski - with whom he released a CD and toured in the UK. Around the same time, as a side project, Jaywalker started the rockabilly band The Greyhounddogs, which attracted a following in Belgium. In 2004, Devilshitburner Records released We're getting closer to the grave each day, a punk/heavy metal/rockabilly tribute to Hank Williams, for which The Greyhounddogs recorded a cover of \\"Lost highway\\". In 2001, Jaywalker joined Marky Ramone & the Speedkings, who put out a first album, No If's And's or But's on White Jazz Records/JVC Japan. The band did three European tours, and released a live album, Alive, on Rawk- A-Hula Records in 2002. The band released the album Legends Bleed in 2002 on Thirsty Ear Records and did a world tour from 2002 to January 2003. Five 7-inches came out from 2002 to the end of 2003, including a split single with Texas Terri. From 2004 on Jaywalker has performed as a solo artist, writing and recording punk 'n' roll with his solo band. His solo album, 59 O'Clock, was released in 2006 on Nicotine Records. In 2007, Jaywalker and music journalist Thomas 'thomaxe' Goze organized a Euro Tour for ex-Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers guitarist Walter Lure. The line up for the tour consisted of Walter Lure (lead guitar and vocals), Dee Jaywalker (lead guitar and vocals), Paolo Serlino (drums), Rine Reginna (bass and backing vocals), and Annette Gucci (guitar and backing vocals). The last show of the tour was recorded and released as a live album in 2008. In 2010, Definitivos celebrated their comeback with a best of album Courtrai Tonight, released on Deaf Records.

The park is located across the Potomac River from George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. Piscataway Park is named after Piscataway Creek, itself named for a Native American tribe. The park is home to bald eagles, beavers, osprey, and other wildlife and encompasses areas of wetland, meadow and woodland. It is administered by the National Park Service and is managed by National Capital Parks-East. History In the mid-1950s, development threatened to destroy the beautiful landscape along the Maryland shore of the Potomac River. Instead of enjoying the same view that George Washington did more than two hundred years ago, visitors to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate would have seen an oil tank farm, a sewage treatment plant, or housing developments. Congresswoman Frances Payne Bolton of Ohio, a member of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, sprang into action. She purchased a 500-acre farm directly across the Potomac from Mount Vernon and next to the Moyaone Reserve, an environmentally conscious planned community. Bolton donated her farm for the creation of the Accokeek Foundation and, with a coalition of organizations that included the Alice Ferguson Foundation, Moyaone Association, and Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, launched an ambitious program to protect six miles of shoreline. This large- scale landscape conservation effort led to the creation of Piscataway Park, the first national park established to \\"preserve historic vistas.\\" Today, the Accokeek Foundation partners with the National Park Service to steward 200 acres of Piscataway Park which covers, in total, approximately 5,000 acres, from Piscataway Creek to Marshall Hall on the Potomac River. An effort that began out of a desire to \\"preserve the view,\\" in the end has preserved much more. The full conservation area protects a wealth of environmental, cultural, and historic resources, from wetlands to farms to nationally significant historic sites. The park is open daily to visitors who enjoy a quiet landscape for recreation and reflection. Annually, thousands of school children visit for farm-based education, learning about environmental stewardship through a historical lens. With support from donors and members, the Accokeek Foundation provides a natural space for all to enjoy, for generations to come. National Colonial Farm The National Colonial Farm is a historic farm museum established by the Accokeek Foundation in 1958. The farm demonstrates 18th century colonial agriculture to increase awareness about endangered heritage livestock by preserving rare breeds of crops and animals, including Ossabaw Island hogs, Hog Island sheep, American Milking Devon cattle, Black Spanish turkeys, and Buckeye chicken. Structures located within the farm site are open to the public and include a circa 1770 farm dwelling, an 18th-century tobacco barn, and an out-kitchen. Costumed interpreters are available on the farm during the season (March - December) on the weekends to help guide the visitor experience as they show you how the typical tobacco farming family might have lived in Maryland. The National Colonial Farm is open daily, and there is no general admission fee except during special events. School and specialty group tour reservations can be made throughout the year.

Devils Hole is a geologic formation located within the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, in Nye County, Nevada, in the Southwestern United States. Devils Hole, a detached unit of Death Valley National Park, is habitat for the only naturally occurring population of the endangered Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). The unit is part of the Ash Meadows complex, an area of desert uplands and spring-fed oases that was designated as a National Wildlife Refuge in 1984. Description Devils Hole is a geothermal pool within a limestone cavern in the Amargosa Desert in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada, east over the Amargosa Range and Funeral Mountains from Death Valley. It is at an elevation of above sea level and the water is a constant temperature of . The surface area of Devils Hole is about 22 m long by 3.5 m wide (72 ft long by 11.5 ft wide). Approximately deep on one end of Devils Hole is a small rock shelf of . The dissolved oxygen of the water is 2.5-3.0 ppm up to around in depth, though the shallow shelf can have dissolved oxygen levels as high as 6.0-7.0 ppm in June and July. A viewing platform overlooks the hole. Devils Hole branches into caverns at least deep, whose bottom has never been mapped. According to geologists, the caves were formed over 500,000 years ago. The pool has frequently experienced activity due to far away earthquakes in Japan, Indonesia and Chile, which have been likened to extremely small scale tsunamis. Pupfish Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon diabolis, from Death Valley National Park Devils Hole is the only natural habitat of the Devils Hole pupfish, which thrives despite the hot, oxygen-poor water. Devils Hole \\"may be the smallest habitat in the world containing the entire population of a vertebrate species\\". The pupfish are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The pupfish has been described as the world's rarest fish, with a population of less than 200 since 2005. Genetic information indicates that the pupfish species is as old as the Hole itself, which opened to the surface about 60,000 years ago. The pupfish have been protected since being declared an endangered species in 1967. Conflicts of the ownership and use of the groundwater around Devils Hole caused litigation in the 1980s. The litigation triggered further protections of the pupfish. However, since the late 1990s, the pupfish population has substantially decreased. The reasons for the decrease are unknown, but is possibly due to a microscopic non-indigenous diving beetle that is consuming pupfish eggs.

Dixon S. Miles Dixon Stansbury Miles (May 4, 1804 ‚Äì September 16, 1862) was a career United States Army officer who served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Indian Wars. He was mortally wounded as he surrendered his Union garrison in the Battle of Harpers Ferry during the American Civil War. Early life and military service Miles was born in Maryland. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1824 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry regiment, but was transferred immediately to the 7th U.S. Infantry, with which he served until 1847. He served on the western frontier and became adjutant of the 7th U.S. He was promoted to captain on June 8, 1836, and fought in the Seminole Wars in Florida from 1839 to 1842. At the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he received a brevet promotion to major for his \\"gallant and distinguished conduct\\" in the defense of Fort Brown, Texas. He fought in the Battle of Monterrey and the Siege of Veracruz, which he then governed as military commandant for four months. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for \\"gallant and meritorious conduct in the several conflicts at Monterrey, Mexico.\\" Miles spent the years before the Civil War on frontier duty battling Indians. In 1857 he fought against Indians along the Gila River, New Mexico, and against the Navajo in 1858. In 1859 he was promoted to colonel and commander of the 2nd U.S. Infantry, stationed at Fort Kearny and Fort Leavenworth. Civil War When the Civil War started, Miles was recalled to Washington, D.C., and briefly commanded a brigade in the division of Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson before being transferred to the army of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, in which he commanded a division of two brigades. During the First Battle of Bull Run, his division was in reserve, but he was accused by Brig. Gen. Israel B. Richardson of being drunk during the battle. A court of inquiry validated this accusation; and, after an eight-month leave of absence, he was reassigned to what should have been a quieter post. In March 1862 he commanded a brigade that defended the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and, in September 1862 he was given command of the U.S. arsenal at Harpers Ferry. =Harpers Ferry= During the Maryland Campaign, in which Confederate general Robert E. Lee invaded the U.S. state of Maryland, Col. Miles's garrison at Harpers Ferry stood directly on Lee's supply line through the Shenandoah Valley. He was ordered by General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck to hold the important U.S. arsenal and railroad bridges until he was relieved by Union forces under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. Lee sent columns converging from three directions to surround Harpers Ferry. Unfortunately for him and his army, Miles apparently treated his orders to defend the town too literally and stationed most of his 14,000 men just outside the town to the west, on Bolivar Heights, neglecting the commanding heights to the northeast (Maryland Heights) and to the south (Loudoun Heights). When his token defensive force on Maryland Heights was defeated, the town was surrounded and virtually indefensible. When Confederate Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson began to bombard the town on September 15, 1862, from the heights he had seized, Miles held a council of war with his brigade commanders and decided to surrender. Before the white flag could be raised, he was struck in the left leg by an exploding shell, mortally wounding him. Some of his men accused him of being drunk on duty again and were so thoroughly disgusted by his inept defense that it was said to be difficult to find a man to carry him to the hospital. Miles died the next day and is buried in St. James Episcopal Church Cemetery in Monkton, Maryland. Legacy Some historians have concluded that Miles was struck by artillery deliberately fired by his own men, but there is no conclusive proof.Eicher, p. 347. The resulting surrender of 12,419 men was the largest number of U.S. soldiers surrendered until the Battle of Bataan in World War II. The court of inquiry into the surrender denounced Miles for \\"incapacity, amounting to almost imbecility.\\"Teetor, p. 238. Notes References * Eicher, David J.

They number around 20 extant genera containing over 400 described species, and are found all over the world except in the polar regions. The larvae of these solitary wasps feed on cockroaches, and develop inside the egg-cases (oothecae) of their hosts.Deans (2008) Description Evaniidae have the metasoma attached very high above the hind coxae on the propodeum, and the metasoma itself is quite small, with a long, one-segmented, tube-like petiole, and compressed laterally over most of its length (segments 2-8). The ovipositor is short and thin. When active, these wasps jerk the metasoma up and down constantly, as referenced in their common names. The mesosoma is high, short, and heavily sclerotized, with a ridged and pitted surface. The head is largely immovable and attaches to the mesosoma on a short neck; with usually 13-segmented antennae that do not differ between males and females. Apomorphies of ensign wasp wings and their venation are: * deeply separated jugal lobes in fore- and hindwings * loss of cross-veins on the distal forewing (though this is hard to determine in some) * hindwings retain only medial, cubital, and part of the costal vein; all others have been lost Ecology As far as is known, ensign wasp larvae are predatory on the eggs of cockroaches. But good host data are only known for a fraction of this family, about 4% as of 2008, thus more unusual life history strategies likely exist. Host specificity and coevolution with roach lineages seem to have played a significant factor in the evolution of some ensign wasp lineages. Others are less discriminating in their host choice, and will attack almost any ootheca of a particular size. Illustration of Evania appendigaster (lower right) and its pupa (upper right) as parasites of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) The female wasp lays an egg inside the roach ootheca (egg case), and the wasp larva hatches quickly and consumes the roach eggs. Technically, they are thus predators, rather than parasites or parasitoids as other parasitic wasps. A single egg is laid per ootheca, into a host egg in some Evaniidae, and between the eggs in others. Some are able to oviposit even when the female cockroach still carries the fresh ootheca around, while other ensign wasps will only attack oothecae that are completed and have been dropped by the mother roach. The wasps seem to be able to determine if an ootheca is already used to host a larva, and refrain from depositing eggs in such cases; alternatively, the larvae might be cannibalistic, with the first to hatch in an ootheca eating any wasp eggs subsequently deposited. Two Evaniidae species, Evania appendigaster and Prosevania fuscipes, have achieved an essentially worldwide distribution nowadays, having been introduced along with various Blattidae species of genera Blatta and Periplaneta. While they do feed on insects that are considered pests, they rarely attain population sizes sufficient to act as effective biocontrol agents. As cockroaches are typically more abundant in and around human settlements, Evaniidae are a regular sight in such habitat where many other wasps are absent, and are frequently encountered in buildings looking for prey. The adults drink nectar from flowers and neither they nor the larvae are dangerous or harmful to humans. Systematics and taxonomy Before 1939, the Evaniidae were a \\"wastebin taxon\\" for any parasitic wasp with unusual morphology. Among these were the more apomorphic and less diverse (but about equally speciose) taxa now placed in the Aulacidae and Gasteruptiidae, which together with ensign wasps make up the superfamily Evanioidea. These were formerly a part of the paraphyletic \\"Parasitica\\", ranked as an infraorder. But the parasitic wasp lineages are not more closely related among themselves than they are related to non-parasitic wasps, thus the \\"Parasitica\\" are an obsolete group.Deans & Jennings (2006), Deans (2008) Rather, the Evanioidea seem to be close relatives of the Megalyroidea, Trigonaloidea, and particularly the Ceraphronoidea. These four superfamilies seem to make up a clade, which could be considered one of several infraorders to replace the superseded \\"Parasitica\\".ToL (1995) =Living genera= The living ensign wasp genera can be divided into one larger and four smaller groups, which might be considered subfamilies. Some genera are hard to place in these, though; they probably represent minor lineages of a more basal position. The groups, with genera sorted according to the presumed relationship, are: Basal genera * Afrevania Benoit, 1953 * Brachevania Turner, 1927 * Vernevania Thaumatevania group * Thaumatevania Ceballos, 1935 * Micrevania Benoit, 1952 Zeuxevania group * Papatuka Deans, 2002 * Parevania Kieffer, 1907 (might belong in Zeuxevania) * Zeuxevania Kieffer, 1902 Evania group * Evania Bradley, 1908 * Prosevania Kieffer, 1911 * Trissevania Kieffer, 1913 Evaniella group * Acanthinevania Bradley, 1908 (might belong in Evaniella) * Evaniella Bradley, 1905\\"1908\\" is lapsus in Deans (2008): see uBio (2005) * Szepligetella Bradley, 1908 (might belong in Evaniella) * Alobevania Kawada & Deans, 2008 Hyptia group * Brachygaster Leach, 1815 * Semaeomyia Bradley, 1908 * Decevania Huben, 2003 * Evaniscus Sz√©pligeti, 1903 * Hyptia Illiger, 1807 * Rothevania Philippi, 1871 =Fossil record= Ensign wasps likely originated over 150 million years ago. Overall, they are successful organisms, existing since the time dinosaurs roamed the Earth with little change in morphology and, presumably, ecology. The fossil record, in particular from fossil amber, is quite comprehensive, with about 10 genera and twice as many species known from the Late Jurassic up to a few million years ago. The primitive Mesozoic genera Andrenelia, Botsvania, and Praevania are only tentatively identified as Evaniidae at present; the first was once separated as family Andreneliidae. Evaniidae seem to have undergone significant evolutionary radiation in the Cretaceous; these taxa were separated as Cretevaniidae, but seem to be a subfamily if anything. The main lineages of extant ensign wasps probably were well separated by the mid-Paleogene. Few Evaniidae have been found in deposits dating from the Paleogene, however, and the ancestry of the living genera consequently remains not well documented. Eoevania and Protoparevania seem to be closer to the living lineages than earlier fossils.

She was appointed to the position of chairperson in 2001, after being groomed for the job, following the retirement of her father Michael Strauss who has continued involvement in the firm in various capacities following his formal retirement. He died in 2020. Strauss is Chair of the Israeli-America Chamber since 2011\\\\. Early life Strauss was born in Nahariya, Israel. The eldest of three children of Ella (born 1935, Yugoslavia), a nurse and holocaust survivor, and Michael, chairperson of Strauss Group, the son of the founders Hilda and Dr. Richard Strauss. Strauss has a younger sister Irit (former advertiser and current business partner of brother) and a younger brother (Adi, a businessman founder of \\"Adi's lifestyle\\"). Strauss grew up in the family business. Her father Michael said in an interview that as an 11-year-old girl, she would join his night delivery route, during which she used to help carrying 20-kg containers of dairy products, listen to his business talks and follow carefully how many cartons were delivered and registered. She filled a number of roles in the company through the years. She graduated in 1987 from Tel Aviv University Law School. As a student, she met Dan Lahat, the son of then Tel Aviv mayor Shlomo Lahat and married him. Her parents divorced in 1981, and during her studies, in 1985 her mother died.

Early life and career Mala's given name was Naseem Nazli. She was born on 9 November 1939 in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. She was the younger sister of music composer Shamim Nazli. Mala was interested in singing and music from a young age. Her elder sister happened to be her first music teacher and Naseem learned the basics of music from her sister. On Shamim Nazli's request, music composer, Baba Ghulam Ahmed Chishti recorded two songs for the Punjabi film Aabroo (1961) in Mala's voice. However, the film flopped. Despite the fact that her elder sister got her a break in films, it was the film producer Anwar Kamal Pasha who persuaded Naseem to try her luck and not give up on the Pakistani film industry. Her first hit in films came in 1962. She changed her name to Mala and sang a simple Urdu composition, Aaya re dekho for the film Sooraj Mukhi (1962). The music was composed by Master Abdullah. In 1962, Mala rendered her voice to a tragic Urdu composition, for the film (1962).

The Moon was once in trouble, when cursed by King Daksha. Markandeya gave the Mahamritryunjaya Mantra to Sati, Daksha's daughter, for the Moon. According to another version this is the Bija mantra as revealed to Rishi Kahola that was given by Lord Shiva to sage Sukracharya, who taught it to Rishi Dadhichi, who gave it to King Kshuva, through whom it reached the Shiva Purana. This mantra is also called the Rudra mantra, referring to the furious aspect of Shiva; the Tryambakam mantra, alluding to Shiva's three eyes; and it is sometimes known as the Mrita-Sanjivini mantra because it is a component of the \\"life-restoring\\" practice given to the primordial sage Sukracharya after he had completed an exhausting period of austerity. Its Devata (patron deity) is Rudra, i.e., Shiva in his fiercest and most destructive roopa or aspect. In the Vedas it finds its place in three texts ‚Äì a) the Rig veda VII.59.12, b) the Yajur Veda III.60, and c) the Atharva Veda XIV.1.17. Significance It is said to be beneficial for mental, emotional and physical health and to be a moksha mantra which bestows longevity and immortality. According to some puranas, the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra has been used by many rishis as well as Sati during the time when Chandra suffered from the curse of Prajapati Daksha. By reciting this mantra, the effect of the curse of Daksha, which could make him die, slowed, and Shiva then took Chandra and placed it upon his head. This mantra is addressed to Shiva for warding off untimely death. It is also chanted while smearing Vibhuti over various parts of the Body and utilised in Japa or Homa (havan) to get desired results. While its energy protects and guides the initiates a mantra re-links consciousness to its deeper and more abiding nature and repetition of the mantra constitutes Japa, the practice of which develops concentration that leads to a transformation of awareness. Whereas the Gayatri Mantra is meant for purification and spiritual guidance, the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is meant for healing rejuvenation and nurturance.

He served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for Delaware County from 1939 to 1947. Early life James was born in Philadelphia. He extensively studied in graphic arts. In 1910, he moved to Radnor Township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. During World War I, he enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to the Central Officers Training School. He was honorably discharged in November 1918 as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves. Career James was president and chairman of the board of directors of the Franklin Printing Co. of Philadelphia (founded in 1728 by Benjamin Franklin). He was a member of the Radnor Township Board of Commissioners from 1929 to 1936. He served in the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives for Delaware County from 1939 through 1946. He was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-first and to the four succeeding Congresses. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1958. James served as president of the Poor Richard Club and also was the first president of the Printing Industries of Philadelphia, an organization for printers. Serving as a Radnor township commissioner from 1929 to 1936, he had been instrumental in reorganizing the township's lighting system and making other improvements. As a state representative from 1939 to 1947, he introduced the James bill, which would have prevented the City of Philadelphia from collecting the wage tax from suburbanites, however the bill was defeated. =1949 to 1953= Upon taking office on January 3, 1949, James was appointed to the District of Columbia and House Administration committees, two relatively low-profile areas. President Truman, meanwhile, had asked Congress to enact a \\"Fair Deal\\" for the American people, calling for an increase in the minimum wage, health insurance and banning discrimination. During his first term, some issues that James voted on were: the Marshall Plan to aid western Europe (Y); Mundt-Nixon Anti-Communist Bill (Y); allowing refugees into the country (Y); National Housing Act of 1949 (N); Agricultural Act of 1949 (price supports) (Y); Trade Agreements Extension Act (Y); Aid to NATO (N); South Korean aid (N); a weakened Fair Employment Practices Act, with no enforcement powers (Y); Proportional Electoral Vote (N); Internal Security Act of 1950, which was passed over a presidential veto (Y). He also took a position in favor of extending rent controls. Although he generally voted the Republican anti-Communist line, he voted against aiding our European allies in NATO and the fledgling Republic of Korea (South Korea), prior to its invasion by Communist North Korea. In a committee vote on the Anti-Poll Tax bill in 1949, he was the only Republican to vote with six conservative southern Democrats against the measure. In 1951, Congressman James introduced a bill to fix the strength of the Marine Corps and make the commandant a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. =1953 to 1958= In 1953, as a member of the majority party, and thirty-seventh in party seniority, James was appointed to the Appropriations Committee. He served on the subcommittees on general government matters, Treasury and Post Office departments, as well as remaining on the District of Columbia committee. He was known as an active member of the committee, according to the News of Delaware County, \\"developing a reputation for paying close attention to government spending.\\" During his service on the Appropriations Committee, the federal government ran budget surpluses in 1956 and 1957. In 1957, he introduced two bills: to include the Ben Franklin TV series in the Archives of Congress and to begin the development of Independence National Historical Park. Overall, he compiled a moderately conservative record, not too different from his two predecessors. In a comparison of 58 important issues voted on between 1949 and 1958, James agreed with ultra-conservative Noah Mason of Illinois 74% of the time, but split on such key issues, such as civil rights and foreign aid. Starting in 1953, the Congressional Quarterly began compiling more detailed information about the voting records of members of Congress. In his first term, Congressman James voted 87% of the time with the majority of his party and supported the Eisenhower administration 65% of the time and was in opposition only 15% of the time. (The numbers do not add up due to missed votes on his part.) In 1955-1956, he was 53% pro-Eisenhower in his votes and 28% against, with his attendance falling to 73% of all recorded votes. By the 1957-1958 term, his attendance had fallen to only 52%, as illness began overtaking him. =Election of 1948= In the primary of 1948, James was backed by the political machine lead by John J. McClure and the Delaware County Board of Republican Supervisors, known as the \\"War Board\\", to unseat the independent incumbent E. Wallace Chadwick. James prevailed by some 7,600 votes in the primary election. In the general election, he easily defeated Democrat Arthur Snyder, 91,394 to 56,263, leading with 61.3% . =The Korean War elections, 1950 and 1952= With the second war in five years grinding on in Korea and casualties mounting, the Democrats were again on the defensive in 1950. The national scene did not seem to have much impact locally, as James won reelection by a margin similar to his first election, 62.7%, over Hubert P. Earle. With campaign finance reporting being rather lax at the time, James reported 1950 expenses of $237, while his opponent reported spending about $2,700. In contrast, fellow Republican Congressman Paul Dague of the Chester/Lancaster district, reported $1,000 in expenses. At a rally held in October at Upper Darby Junior High School, James, along with county party chairman Throne, Mrs. Ray Murdock, national committeewoman, and C. William Kraft, Jr., chairman of the Citizens for Eisenhower committee, warmed up the crowd. James said he had \\"traveled the length and breadth of the county to answer the lies and half-truths promulgated by our opponents.\\" The election was a \\"crusade rather than a campaign - a crusade against a crowd who usurped the fair name of the Democratic Party and ‚Ä¶ degraded it.\\" With the help of a lopsided G.O.P. registration edge of 211,188 to 30,254, James was reelected with a solid 61.7% of the vote, 127,918 to Democrat Murray Zealor's 79,423. He reported expenses of $225 and Zealor reported $27. In the county, the popular Ike received 128,889 to Stevenson's 79,734, also carrying Chester, 12,772 to 11,944. =The 1954 midterm election= On March 1, 1954, four Puerto Rican fanatics, shouting for independence for the island, sprayed the House of Representatives with pistol fire, wounding five members of Congress. James narrowly escaped injury when a bullet struck the wall behind him. Later that month, he was endorsed for a fourth term by McClure and the War Board and was opposed by independent Harry Hyde of Drexel Hill in the primary. Also endorsed were incumbent state representatives, M. Joseph Connelly of Upper Darby, J. Warren Bullen of Lansdowne, Edwin E. Lippincott of Upper Darby, along with newcomers Joseph W. Isaacs, Folcroft, John H. Foster, Wayne, and Clarence D. Bell of Upland. Re-endorsed for seats on the state committee were Mrs. Mae Kernaghan of Yeadon, a future state legislator, and Albert H. Swing of Radnor, later to be involved in controversy as a county commissioner. According to the News, the county chairman \\"pointed out that the ticket was arrived at without dissension\\". The Democrats, however, did have plenty of dissension, including a fierce primary fight for James' seat between the endorsed candidate, O. Arthur Cappiello, and Swarthmore College professor Gerard W. Mangone. Minority County Commissioner Albert J. Crawford, Jr. charged that Upper Darby Democratic chairman Joseph Helyenek worked with Republicans against a Democratic candidate in 1951. Helyenek countered with charges that Crawford was \\"playing footsie\\" with McClure and the G.O.P. machine and also launched bitter attacks on the county party chairman, John Sheehan. When the votes were counted, Cappiello had won, 4,808 to 3,038 and James had been renominated over Hyde, 43,049 to 8,216. In the fall election, the Democrats turned their fire from themselves to the G.O.P., waging a vigorous campaign. The opposition party charged that the Republican-led government had not corrected \\"intolerable\\" traffic bottlenecks at the busy 69th Street commercial district in Upper Darby, delayed constructing a county mental hospital, failed to exempt suburbanites from the Philadelphia wage tax, did nothing to stop a \\"probable\\" reduction of unemployment benefits, condoned \\"blueblood\\" gambling, took no action regarding \\"hidden unemployment\\", as well as refusing to debate the Democratic candidates openly. The Republicans countered by accusing the Democrats of scheming to annex the suburban counties to Philadelphia (a preelection bugaboo that was repeated in succeeding elections in various forms), plotting to levy a wage tax on county residents and running a \\"Fifth Amendment sympathizer\\" for governor. GOP County Chairman Throne told the Women's Club of Morton that state Senator George Leader, Democratic candidate for governor, and his \\"bosses\\" were hatching a plot, authored by the \\"Dilworth-Clark Democratic machine in Philadelphia\\" to annex the suburbs to the city. \\"Dilworth and Clark will rule Delaware County and the counties adjacent to Philadelphia from their palatial soft rug upholstered sanctums in dirty Philadelphia City Hall,\\" he further warned. \\"Annexation ‚Ä¶ would give the Philadelphia Democratic Machine more money and increase the tax load of the suburban home owner who moved away from Philadelphia to get clean economic government.\\" Democrat Cappiello returned the fire with some of his own, rejecting G.O.P. claims that a vote for James was a vote for the popular President Eisenhower. James, he said, was \\"not an Eisenhower supporter except when it suits John McClure.\\" Further, he stated \\"McClurism, not Eisenhower, is at issue in Delaware County\\", blasting James for his \\"opposition to labor legislation, housing, aid to veterans and other progressive measures. The Democratic congressional hopeful said that James opposed Eisenhower's programs in about one-third of the roll-call votes and cited seven votes \\"where James was in open rebellion against the Eisenhower program\\" and five missed votes on major items. At a rally held in Yeadon, Cappiello lashed out at the federal and state inaction regarding the recession, warning \\"we are rapidly approaching a situation fully comparable to the Hoover Depression in terms of human misery\\". Indeed, the unemployment rate had increased from the low of 2.5% in 1953 to an average rate of 5.0% for 1954, as the economy adjusted to the end of the Korean War, but it hardly approached the peak Depression rate of 24.9% in 1933. Cappiello's credibility seemed a bit strained: on one hand, he was blaming the Eisenhower administration for the recession, and on the other, he was criticizing James for not voting with the Eisenhower position more often. Whether the voters realized this or not is unclear, but, in spite of the vigorous campaign by the Democrats, James won another term easily, carrying 60.9% of the vote this time, with a 36,000 vote plurality. According to the News, \\"a sign of Mr. James apparent popularity in the county is the fact he ran well ahead of the rest of the Republican ticket\\". The paper cited the fact he polled about 1,600 votes more than the next highest vote-getter, the candidate for state secretary of internal affairs. =The 1956 election= With the McClure political machine securely in control of Delaware County, local attention was centered on the possibility that former Philadelphia mayor and reformer, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. might pull an upset over incumbent Republican Senator Duff. In various speeches throughout the fall campaign, Congressman James, as well as state Senator G. Robert Watkins, attacked Clark mercilessly, often citing his membership in the liberal group, Americans for Democratic Action. In one speech in October, both officeholders said that Clark's \\"membership in the ADA alone is enough to disqualify Joe Clark from sitting in Jim Duff's chair in the U.S. Senate\\" and that the ADA had provided unspecified \\"aid and comfort to the cause of international communism\\". It was clear that even though McCarthyism had been renounced in Congress, the same tactics were alive and well in Delaware County in 1956. The Democrats quickly returned the fire, with the county chairman, Charles J. Hepburn Jr., stating that James and his colleagues in the county, in attacking Clark's patriotism, were \\"duplicating cornered rat tactics that led to the defeat of the corrupt and whipped Republican regime in Philadelphia in 1949.\\" This did not deter James, however, who again spoke out against Clark at a campaign stop. Meanwhile, James's opponent, William A. Welsh, blasted the incumbent and congressional Republicans, stating that their version of tax relief meant a \\"steelworker family of four would pay $420 taxes on a $5,000 income, while a coupon clipping stockholder pays only $200 on the same income\\". Further, he said: \\"James claims of so-called accomplishments have resulted in the last four years of profits of the corporations increasing 35 per cent, while income for the average family is up only four per cent. It is time that Delaware County had someone in Congress who thinks of prosperity in terms of the people and not just in the interests of big business\\". Adding fuel to the senatorial election fires, the County Commissioners, on October 10, with the lone Democrat strenuously objecting, voted two to one to condemn a proposed increase in the Philadelphia wage tax, linking it to spending increases during Clark's previous tenure as mayor. The Democratic commissioner charged election years politics was the real concern of the Republicans. In stepping up his attacks, Welsh charged James with a \\"cynical attitude\\" towards public housing, having \\"voted to kill public housing outright\\", causing \\"those in low incomes (to) have little hope of getting housing.\\" James, who was consistently popular among the voters, did not bother to publicly respond, but saved his remarks for defending the record of Senator Duff against the rising tide of Joe Clark's candidacy. On October 24, at a speech to four hundred party workers at the Essington Republican Club, James defended the military draft. \\"Parents do not want ever again to have untrained and unprepared kids sent into battle\\", with President Eisenhower being \\"their best insurance against war.\\" Further, he declared that the draft would \\"insure proper conditioning of our youth in the event of armed conflict.\\" Some eight years later, James' remarks would be tested when hundreds of thousands of \\"kids\\" would be drafted to serve in Vietnam. James deafeated Welsh, with about 62% of the vote, 137,764 to 84,764. From the expense reports filed with Congress, the local campaigns spent minimal money, with James reporting no expenses at all, to the Democrat's $804. =Final term and failing health= On February 15, 1958, James announced he would not be a candidate for a sixth term. His modest statement read: \\"At the conclusion of the 85th Congress I shall have served as a member of the national house of Representatives for ten years - five consecutive terms. My decision to forgo possible further preferment for public office has been made regretfully, and only after carefully weighing the demands of such service against the inevitable changes, of personal concern, that come with the passing of time\\". He had been hospitalized twice in 1957 for an undisclosed illness and in May of that year had had surgery. By June 1958, he had resigned his seat on the Appropriations Committee due to his \\"worsening physical condition.\\" Just as Ike had brought stability to the nation in the Cold War era of the 1950s, Ben James seemed to be a pillar of political stability to the residents of rapidly growing Delaware County. Voters showed their unfading confidence in him by giving him election majorities ranging from 60.9% to 62.7%. He died at age seventy-five on January 26, 1961 and is interred at the Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. James voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

The ice facade is approximately 60 m high Ice formations in the Titlis glacier cave A glacier cave is a cave formed within the ice of a glacier. Glacier caves are often called ice caves, but the latter term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice. Overview This glacier cave has been excavated by a hot spring underneath a snow field in south central Iceland, a country where such formations are common due to the high geothermal and volcanic activity, plus the high latitude, cold weather, and frequent snowfall. Most glacier caves are started by water running through or under the glacier. This water often originates on the glacier's surface through melting, entering the ice at a moulin and exiting at the glacier's snout at base level. Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an air- filled cavity, sometimes aided by solifluction. Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter. Some glacier caves are formed by geothermal heat from volcanic vents or hotsprings beneath the ice. An extreme example is the Kverkfj√∂ll glacier cave in the Vatnaj√∂kull glacier in Iceland, measured in the 1980s at long with a vertical range of . Some glacier caves are relatively unstable due to melting and glacial motion, and are subject to localized or complete collapse, as well as elimination by glacial retreat. An example of the dynamic nature of glacier caves is the former Paradise Ice Caves, located on Mt. Rainier in the United States. Known since the early 1900s, the caves were thought to have disappeared altogether in the mid-1940s, yet in 1978 cavers measured of passageways in glacier caves there, and it was then considered the longest glacier cave system in the world. The Paradise Ice Caves collapsed and vanished in the 1990s, and the lower lobe of the glacier which once contained the caves has also vanished entirely between 2004 and 2006. Glacier caves may be used by glaciologists to gain access to the interior of glaciers. The study of glacier caves themselves is sometimes called \\"glaciospeleology\\".

Launched in 1994, it was originally known for its compatibility with Doom, for which it functioned as a matchmaking service for online multiplayer. The service also supported various other titles, including other id Software games such as Doom II and Heretic as well as titles from other companies like Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, and Shadow Warrior from 3D Realms. To use the service, players would pay a fee and run the DWANGO client software which would dial into a DWANGO server. Initially, a phone number in Houston, Texas had to be dialed, but soon a number of servers in other cities were also set up. However, DWANGO's dial in approach was soon overshadowed by online multiplayer through the increasingly popular Internet and the service ceased operation in October 1998. Its Japanese division has continued to flourish, evolving into the telecommunications/media company which now operates the Niconico video hosting service. History DWANGO was created in 1994 by Bob Huntley and Kee Kimbrell in Houston, Texas. Huntley had wanted to transition his company Interactive Visual Systems from providing video training to online gaming services. After completing initial development on the service, the two of them pitched the idea to id Software; John Carmack and other id staff were largely uninterested, but the duo found support in John Romero. Jay Wilbur negotiated a deal for 20% of DWANGO's revenues and Romero worked on the project, releasing the first version of the DWANGO software with the shareware release of Heretic. Since it predated widespread consumer access to the Internet, players had to dial long distance to Houston. Even so, it was wildly popular, and the creators reaped a healthy profit from the subscription fees. Initial players paid $1.95 an hour, but by early 1995 the price dropped and ten thousand subscribers were paying $8.95 a month, some calling from as far as Italy and Australia. The company set up headquarters in New York City. Soon they set up a franchising system. A flat fee of $35,000 was charged to set up a server and the franchisee could keep the rest of the profits. In four months, 22 servers were set up across the country. In 1996, the service expanded to cover Japan, Singapore and South Korea. By 1997, the company had systems in 23 cities around the world, but its user base was shrinking. In March, Interactive Visual Systems signed a deal with Microsoft to set up a section on the Internet Gaming Zone in an attempt to compete with increasingly popular Internet multiplayer services. The channel officially went live in December 1997; the launch had been delayed due to technical issues with the software that automatically disconnected users from the Internet then connected them to DWANGO's servers. Bob Huntley had hoped the move would increase his service's user base, but it fell short of expectations. DWANGO increasingly relied on its low latency (guaranteed 70 ms or less) to compete with services which were cheaper and offered more content. The \\"DWANGO Zone\\" was at the time only one of two pay sections of the site, charging an hourly rate. By this time, rival services such as Mpath, TEN and Heat.net had emerged, offering free multiplayer options in addition to paid services. The company attempted a major marketing initiative earlier in the year that was aborted when they were unable to raise sufficient investment capital. They were also struggling to get developers to add support for DWANGO to their games. Many of the titles supported by the service, such as Quake and Total Annihilation were already playable over the Internet for free. With increased competition and decreasing game support, DWANGO's subscriber base dwindled. It was formally shut down in 1998. However, its division in Japan continued to do well and continued operation as DWANGO Co. Software and games supported right Users originally ran the DWANGO client software as a DOS application which required booting up independent of Windows 3.1 into DOS mode because of hardware constraints of that era. Servers were represented by area code as during its original inception the only way to log onto DWANGO was via a dial- up modem. The client featured an ASCII interface requiring users to connect via dial-up modem. Once logged in, users could chat in a lobby with other gamers and create their own launchpad for the specific game of their choice. DWANGO originally supported id Software's games, and would later expand to offer games from developers and publishers such as 3D Realms. Games supported included the following: *Big Red Racing *Blood *Descent II *Doom *Doom II: Hell on Earth *Duke Nukem 3D *Final Doom *Heretic *Hexen: Beyond Heretic *MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat *Quake II *Shadow Warrior *Terminal Velocity *The Ultimate Doom *Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness *Total Annihilation See also *XBAND  References  External links * * Austin DWANGO website * DWANGO Steam group for old acquaintances to meet up * Deathmatch '95 press release Category:Online video game services Category:Doom (franchise) Category:1994 establishments in Texas Category:1998 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"DWANGO"},{"id":"5684180","text":"Doug Morency is a Canadian improviser, and a former member of The Second City comedy troupe and The Williamson Playboys with fellow Second City alum Paul Bates.

The original Melter, Bruno Horgan, first appeared in Tales of Suspense #47 (November 1963). Publication history The character debuted in Tales of Suspense #47 (Nov. 1963) and was created by Stan Lee and Sam Rosen. He was an industrialist who specializes in providing munitions to the United States government. After an initial encounter with hero Iron Man, the character reappears in Avengers #6 (Jul. 1964) as part of supervillain team the Masters of Evil. A version of the Masters of Evil return in Avengers #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965), with the Melter being jailed.

As writer Mike Conroy stated \\"Bruno Horgan was one of those villains who suited simpler times...Times moved on, though, and Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's creation didn't. Despite numerous upgrades to his weaponry, the Melter was never a major player.\\"Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004.

Fictional character biography =Bruno Horgan= Bruno Horgan is driven into bankruptcy when a government safety inspection team proves that he is using inferior materials, with the defense contracts awarded to his competitor Tony Stark (the alter ego of hero Iron Man). Discovering that one of his faulty devices is capable of generating a beam capable of \\"melting\\" anything composed of iron, Horgan redesigns the device so that it can be strapped to his chest, and after donning a costume adopts the alias the Melter. As the Melter, Horgan becomes a professional criminal and embarks on a campaign of industrial sabotage against Stark, hoping to ruin him, eventually encountering Iron Man after Stark is told he could lose his government contracts, though when he first met Stark he succeeded in knocking him out. Despite damaging the hero's armor and forcing Iron Man back, the Melter is defeated when Stark builds a temporary duplicate armor composed of aluminium, but leaps into the sewer, though Stark is unaware whether he was killed or not.Tales of Suspense #47 (Nov. 1963) The Melter reappears as an employee of master villain Baron Zemo (who has upgraded the melting beam to affect all metals) as part of supervillain team the Masters of Evil. He helps spray Adhesive X over the city. The Melter meets Iron Man as the Avengers first meet the Masters, but Iron Man knocks him away using his magnetic repulsor. The Masters were defeated with the Melter being jailed after Iron Man drenches him with water, preventing his beam from working.Avengers #6 (Jul. 1964) The Radioactive Man was deported back to China, while the Black Knight and Melter are placed in a cell with bars chemically treated so they cannot be melted. The Masters of Evil have a second encounter with the Avengers after the Black Knight and Melter are broken out of jail by the Enchantress and Executioner. The Melter nearly finishes Iron Man after welding his boots to a roof, but he is stopped by Thor using his uru hammer, which the Melter cannot melt. The Masters of Evil are eventually defeated after Thor transported them and the Avengers to another dimension, with different scientific laws which meant their weapons rebounded. The villains are bound and returned to Earth.Avengers #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965) The character upgrades his weaponry and battles Iron Man once again,Tales of Suspense 89 - 90 (May - Jun. 1967) before reappearing as part of the next version of the Masters of Evil, although the villains are defeated when betrayed by the Black Knight.Avengers #54 - 55 (Jul. - Aug. 1968) The Masters of Evil - with the Melter - also accidentally encounter the Avengers during a parade and during the battle are defeated when surprised by the superheroines the Lady Liberators.Avengers #83 (Dec. 1970) The Melter has several battles with Iron Man: at the direction of other-dimensional villain the Black Lama, the Melter joins fellow villains Whiplash and the Man-Bull to form the team the Death Squad and attempt to kill the hero;Iron Man #72 (Jan. 1974) upgrades once again and attack before being defeated;Iron Man #92 (Nov. 1976) and reappears, with many other villains, as an employee of criminal mastermind Justin Hammer.

The Scourge destroys the latest melting ray right afterwards.Avengers #263 (Jan. 1986) =Christopher Colchiss= The second Melter character first appears in Dark Reign: Young Avengers #1 (July 2009) and was created by Paul Cornell and Mark Brooks. Christopher Colchiss later adopts the Melter name and is recruited to lead the \\"Young Masters\\", a teenage super team opposing the Young Avengers. This Melter has inherent melting super powers and does not require artificial aids. Unlike the original Melter, his abilities also extend to humans.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #1 - 5 (July - Dec. 2009) Melter has serious doubts about the moral conviction of most his teammates, and twice he has made mistakes with his powers that killed people - his parents when he was young and more recently an old lady who maced him in the face thinking he was a mugger. Melter also caused a subway station to collapse by melting its supports by accident, though without causing any serious casualties. These incidents have resulted in making him extremely hesitant to use his powers in combat. Melter desires to be a hero, but is unsure just what he needs to do in order to be one.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #4 Colchiss was later recruited by Mandarin and Zeke Stane to assist the other Iron Man villains in taking down Iron Man.

The Melter's first melting beam could affect iron, while a later version could affect almost any substance. The melting effect did not appear to involve heat, but when used on a human being, the beam inflicts burns as opposed to truly melting. The Melter uses several of these devices, including hand-held pistol versions and a device worn on his torso in a harness. Horgan possesses extensive knowledge of weapons and munitions. The second Melter can mentally agitate the molecules in solid matter so that it loses cohesion, thereby melting the object in question.

Wallace Chadwick (January 17, 1884 ‚Äì August 18, 1969) was an American politician from Indiana who served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district from 1947 to 1949. E. Wallace Chadwick was born in Vincennes, Indiana, and moved with his parents to Chester, Pennsylvania in 1890. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1906, and from the law school of the same university in 1910. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was president judge of the Delaware County Orphan's Court in 1945. He was elected as a Republican to the 80th United States Congress, but was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1948. In 1954 he was named chief counsel of special Senate committee to study censure charges against Senator Joseph McCarthy. Early life and education E. Wallace Chadwick was born in Vincennes, Indiana and moved with his parents to Chester, Pennsylvania in 1890. He graduated from Chester High School in 1902, the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in 1906 and the University of Pennsylvania Law School with a LL.B in 1910. He was admitted to the Delaware County bar in 1910. He began practicing law in Chester, representing Governor William Sproul, as well as many major corporations. He also served two years as the President of the county bar association. His first foray into politics was in 1940 when he organized Willkie for President clubs in the county, as an independent Republican. 1945 court appointment On January 19, 1945, Chadwick was the choice of state Senate Majority Leader Weldon Brinton Heyburn to fill the remaining year of a vacancy for president judge of the Delaware County Orphans Court. He was then nominated by Governor Edward Martin and was approved by the state senate 48 to 0. Judge Chadwick then announced his intention to run that year for the full ten-year term. But, since Heyburn and Martin had deliberately acted independently of John J. McClure, chairman of the Delaware County Board of Republican Supervisors (known as the War Board), Chadwick would face an uphill fight in the primary election. Even though until then, it was the War Board's policy to endorse a sitting judge for reelection, McClure evidently would not even allow a small breath of political independence in the county. Congressman James Wolfenden, who was by then, considered to be one of the three most powerful leaders in the county party, with McClure and Haverford leader Tom Weidemann being the other two, debated whether to support the endorsed slate or not. On April 5, after weeks of deliberating, Wolfenden agreed to support the entire ticket, with a payback from the party in the candidacy of his close friend, Clarence Pepper of Upper Darby, for county controller. After a strenuous campaign, in which McClure gave orders to party workers to \\"get out the vote or else\\", had each polling place covered by six workers, and spent a whopping $75,000, Chadwick was narrowly defeated by War Board-endorsed candidate E. Leroy van Roden and would serve only until the end of the year. The tally was 29,808 for Chadwick to 31,428 for the winner. However, in losing, Chadwick polled some impressive results, carrying Swarthmore by 732 to 57, but much more importantly, in a slap to Wolfenden, lost Upper Darby by only 1,105 votes. But, Chadwick would not be finished with politics by any stretch of the imagination. Election of 1946 On February 13, 1946, hours before Wolfenden's press release announcing his retirement from Congress was received by the Chester Times, Chadwick, by coincidence, issued a release of his own declaring his candidacy. Indeed, five days earlier, with the approval of the former judge, nominating petitions had been circulated by his supporters. But, with Wolfenden's departure, other Republicans were interested in the $10,000 a year job also, among them state representative James, who filed petitions of his own for Congress, instead of running for another term in Harrisburg. Even though it was rumored that McClure had promised the seat to James two years earlier, on March 8, the party endorsed a federal labor mediator, James F. Dewey, rather than James. Declaring to the voters, \\"I want you to reclaim Delaware County from the stigma of McClurism\\", the 62-year-old Chadwick eventually nosed out James Dewey by only 287 votes out of 76,543 cast, according to unofficial results. He was able to pull off this narrow victory over the county machine by carrying 31 of the 49 municipalities in the congressional district, especially the larger towns of Haverford (3,919 to 3,604), Lansdowne (1,755 to 703), Ridley Township (1,363 to 1,145), Springfield (963 to 761), Swarthmore (a whopping 817 to 172), and most surprisingly, Wolfenden's Upper Darby (8,669 to 6,734). His showing in Chester was even respectable, a loss of only two-to-one 9,131 to 4,540. Also, two state legislative candidates, who ran on the Chadwick ticket, ex-marine Walter F. Layer of Ridley Park and former state representative T. Jay Sproul, of Nether Providence, won, squeezing past William H. Milliken, of Sharon Hill, later to be congressman, and Samuel Walker of Upper Darby. The third at-large seat was won by McClure candidate incumbent Ellwood J. Turner, also of Nether Providence. Perhaps all of the thousands of veterans who returned from fighting for freedom overseas saw for the first time that their own local government was not being true to the American principles of political freedom and democracy and opted for a change. With this narrow victory, Chadwick has the distinction of being the only person to defeat the War Board as a declared independent in a countywide Republican primary for Congress, or for any major office, for that matter. In the fall of 1946, the Republican campaign battle cry to the voters was \\"Had enough?\\", in response to fourteen years of Democratic rule and the difficult postwar adjustment period, which included soaring inflation, numerous union strikes and the \\"Red scare\\", the fear of communists in our government. The Chester Times ran a headline, stating: \\"Only Mystery of Election is Size of GOP Majority\\", which summed up the view of most political observers. Once again, Vernon O'Rourke was the Democratic nominee, but unlike the previous election, he generally maintained a low profile, as Democrats across the nation were forced to the defensive. In October, Chadwick, in one of his frequent radio addresses, which must have been a new experience for county residents who were used to a less visible candidate, called for a Republican House majority. He stated that \\"Congress needs more than an appeaser - a comprehension of the nation's problems, a desire to serve America and my people of Delaware County that transcends any thought of profit to myself...\\" The Media League of Women Voters forum on October 18 was generally a low-key affair, with positions on several foreign and domestic issues given by both candidates. Regarding the hot issue of whether the wartime price controls should be lifted, Chadwick was emphatically in favor, while O'Rourke took the traditional Democratic view that the controls should be retained. Arthur Bretherick, chairman of the county Republican committee, gave a speech in which a ludicrous charge was made, apparently linking the Democrats to the Communists. \\"Soviet Moscow in an official radio broadcast to the U.S. has demanded the defeat of Edward Martin for U.S. senate, James H. Duff for governor, E. Wallace Chadwick for Congress, as well as our other candidates. Let's give Stalin and Tito our answer on Tuesday with a great Republican majority.\\" (There was no indication whether Soviet dictator Stalin or Yugoslavian leader Tito responded.) Although registered Republicans outnumbered the Democrats by 152,367 to 27,719, the Democrats predicted that O'Rourke would beat Chadwick by about 5,000 votes. Chadwick easily defeated his Democratic challenger, 76,021 to 38,253 in the great Republican landslide of 1946. The G.O.P. was resoundingly returned to the majority, seizing fifty- six additional House seats and thirteen in the Senate. The new lineup was 246-188 in the House and 51-45 in the Senate. In Pennsylvania, the G.O.P. was still firmly in the driver's seat, giving Senator Guffey a win over his opponent, while James H. Duff, won the governorship over John S. Rice, 1.828 million to 1.270 million. Further, the Democrats would be sending five congressmen to Washington from the keystone state, while the G.O.P. had 28. This would be the last election in which the Republicans would command such an overwhelming lead over the Democrats in Pennsylvania. Because of the Democratic lock on the ten former states of the Confederacy, the \\"Solid South\\", it was not always easy for the Republicans to pick up enough seats in other regions to gain numerical control of the House. In 1946, there were no Republicans serving in the House out of 95 seats in the deep South. In the border states, the Democrats also led, 30 - 23. To more than offset this advantage, the Republicans captured 135 out of 180 seats in the larger states and had a huge margin in the relatively sparsely populated farm belt. As the Democrats continued to make inroads in these normally Republican states, the former would be assured control of the House for the next three decades. Record in Washington The Eightieth Congress was the first Republican majority since 1928: Joseph W. Martin of Massachusetts was elected Speaker of the House and Wallace H. White of Maine was elected Senate Majority Leader. Congressman Chadwick went to Washington on January 3, 1947 and established a typically conservative Republican voting record. He sought to maintain higher visibility before the voters than either his predecessor or successor did. He introduced bills to protect GI insurance and relegate to the states all federal interest in coastal tidelands. A vigorous anti-Communist, he strongly defended the appropriation for the House Un-American Activities committee. Some of his votes on major legislation were: the Labor Disputes Act, establishing a Mediation Board (Y); the now well-known Taft-Hartley Act, which curbed some union abuses and was passed over President Truman's veto (Y); the constitutional amendment to limit a president to two terms, (Y); extending rent controls, (Y); reducing income taxes, (Y); aid to Greece and Turkey to resist Communist aggression, (Y); to admit Hawaii as a state (N); an Anti-Poll Tax bill (Y). He brought the office of congressman more up-to-date by adopting a policy of answering personally every piece of correspondence he received from his constituents. \\"After all, if people can't get help from their public officers when they need it, they may well conclude that the subversionists are right, and that democracy...is really a farce so far as the little guy is concerned,\\" Chadwick said in another radio address to his constituents. The battle for a second term On March 31, 1948, in a speech to the House, Congressman Chadwick vociferously defended the European Recovery Plan, otherwise known as the Marshall Plan. \\"If there ever was a bill before the House in the two short years of my service here with which I have no difficulty, it is this bill for European recovery,\\" he declared. \\"It is the only plan (to save Europe from Communist domination) that is offered short of a shooting war.\\" He also tempered his remarks by stating he was confident that the American and Soviet people could find common grounds for settling their political differences peaceably. His speech was described by the News of Delaware County as \\"ringing, bluntly worded...that drew salvos of applause from the floor and a packed gallery, as well as personal commendation from Democratic Minority Leader Sam Rayburn\\". None of this really mattered back home in the smoke-filled living room of John McClure. The War Board had selected former state representative Benjamin James to oppose Chadwick and a bitter primary fight ensued, with Chadwick supporting Guy G. deFuria for state senator and two incumbent state representatives and a third independent Republican, Carl E. Mau. The county newspapers took a pro-Chadwick stance, often giving his statements and frequent radio addresses prominent front page coverage. At one point, charges flew that the War Board had a billboard erected in Chester that read: \\"A VOTE FOR GUY deFURIA IS A VOTE FOR A DIRTY GOVERNMENT. WE KNOW HIS KIND.\\" The Chester Times story covering this read: \\"Smear Billboard Against deFuria Erected in City\\". McClure was so moved by the story that he wrote a letter to the editor, which was published on the front page, denying personal responsibility for the billboard, blaming the incident on a campaign worker who had a personal grudge against deFuria. He further admonished Congressman Chadwick, stating \\"Even in a political campaign people have the right to expect common honesty in a candidate.\\" To its credit, the Times printed Chadwick's rebuttal next to the letter, along with a statement from the newspaper, which read in part: \\"The fact remains that Mr. McClure is responsible for the acts of his agents just as he is responsible for the worst campaign of smear which present members of the Chester Times' staff have ever witnessed.\\" Another controversy ensued on April 21, when a Republican congressman from Philadelphia, George W. Sarbacher, Jr., addressed a rally held by McClure at the Media Armory and spoke against Chadwick. \\"This country badly needs veterans of the caliber and ability and forthrightedness of Ben James,\\" Sarbacher, a former Marine captain who was first elected in 1946 while still on active duty, told the crowd of 1,500. According to the Daily Times, \\"it is the first time in the memory of the oldest members of the delegation that one Pennsylvania representative has gone into another's district to campaign against him.\\" What puzzled observers was that the relationship between Sarbacher, at age 28, the youngest member of the Congress, and the much older Chadwick had been totally amicable. There was widespread belief that the Philadelphia congressman had been ordered to appear at the rally by McClure's counterpart, Austin Meehan, boss of the huge city G.O.P. machine. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, members of the state's Republican delegation were \\"very bitter\\" and intended to protest this action to Governor James H. Duff. At their weekly luncheon in Washington, no formal action was taken by the congressmen to sanction Sarbacher, due to the presence of guests, including some students and former congressmen Wolfenden and Roland Kinzer of Lancaster County. Wolfenden was reported to have been very ill, having attended the luncheon in a wheel chair. Congressmen Lichtenwalner, Bucks County, McConnell, Montgomery County, and Hugh Scott of Philadelphia demanded a \\"showdown\\" with the Governor. As a result, Sarbacher was reportedly \\"placed on ice for a year\\", receiving no assignments from the delegation. He was then defeated in the general election by William J. Green, Jr., as Meehan's machine continued to lose ground to the Democrats. Also, in April, Chadwick sued McClure to prevent the latter's use of the name of the Republican Party of Delaware County on campaign literature. The effort of the McClure organization to drape themselves with the cloak of decent and honorable Republicans is illegal... and it constitutes deliberate fraud against the Republican voters of Delaware County,\\" Chadwick charged in one of his customary radio addresses. \\"Under the law, and under the rules of the Republican party, the Republican Primary belongs to all qualified Republican voters,\\" he continued. \\"There are plenty of people who think I am a better Republican than McClure. At least, I have never brought my party into disrepute...\\" Apparently, the county judge hearing the case did not share those views and dismissed the case. He also gave another radio speech, playing on public fears of Communist subversion, denouncing Communism as the \\"deadly enemy\\" of America, \\"godless\\" and out to \\"conquer the world\\". Perhaps due to his votes for a strong national defense, he was endorsed by John G. Pew, the wealthy president of Sun Shipbuilding. National columnist Drew Pearson even wrote that House Republicans were rooting for Chadwick's reelection. Pearson stated that they were \\"hoping he will not be replaced by another cypher\\", since his predecessor, Wolfenden, was not very visible in Washington. Colleague Congressman Plumley of Vermont even wrote a letter of support to the Times, but none of the support and accolades outside of the district really mattered. What mattered was the support of one man, McClure, which Chadwick simply did not have. The Chester Times invited the four candidates for Congress and state senate to issue final statements on election eve. Congressman Chadwick's statement of 364 words stated that his \\"record is an open book\\" and that \\"opposition to me stems solely from factional politics\\". He decried the misrepresentation of his record as favoring annexation of the suburbs by Philadelphia. \\"If McClure and his candidate for Congress had any desire to be fair in this campaign, he would have told you how Ben James would have voted differently than I voted, had he been in Congress...They cannot tell you that I ever voted for any single law which was not beneficial to the people of this county...\\" In contrast, the low-profile James issued a terse, sixteen word statement: \\"We will win. I am confident the Republican voters will nominate me by a substantial majority.\\" Guy deFuria's statement was about as lengthy as Chadwick's, charging that the county G.O.P. chairman, Arthur Bretherick sent letters to \\"state job-holders threatening their jobs in violation of the governor's announced position of non-interference in Primary elections...Among those threatened are Civil Service employees (protected against political interference by law) and persons subject to the Federal Hatch Act.\\" DeFuria's opponent for state senator, and later to be congressman himself, G. Robert Watkins, also issued a sixteen word statement similar to that of James. When the results were tallied, Chadwick had lost to the colorless James, by a sizable 47,790 to 40,165, according to the Times. This time, his losses in the bigger towns were too much to be overcome by his popularity in the smaller ones. He lost Haverford Twp by 1,100 votes, Upper Darby by 600, his opponent's hometown of Radnor by over 1,100 votes, but ironically, improved his showing in Chester by 600 votes. His running mates for state office also lost. Once again, the McClure Machine proved that once all of the stops were pulled in an election, it was invincible. In a front page editorial on April 28, the Times stated that Chadwick was defeated \\"because he did not conform to the will of one individual, namely McClure. Money and effort must be spent like water to suppress any change in the pattern of machine dictatorship which has dominated and continues to dominate both Delaware County and Chester.\\" It was clear to many that the loss of such an able and dedicated public servant was another sorry chapter in the saga of county politics. Service after leaving Congress After he left office in 1949, Chadwick returned to his private law practice in Chester and served in 1954 as chief counsel to the Senate committee investigating Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. In 1954, he received an honorary doctorate of laws degree from the Pennsylvania Military College in Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1956, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles named Chadwick to a seven-member panel to review the records of all career foreign service officers. He died in Chester, Pennsylvania and is interred at the Old Union Methodist Church Cemetery in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.

It was also one of the companies that merged with Richfield Oil to form the AtlanticRichfield Co. later known as ARCO. After an unsuccessful spinoff from ARCO, Atlantic was acquired by Sunoco in 1988. The remainder of ARCO was later acquired by BP, but BP later sold most of Arco's retail assets and brand name were sold to Tesoro, renamed Andeavor in 2017. The Arco brand is now owned by Marathon Petroleum.  History  = Early years & Standard Oil = Atlantic was founded as the Atlantic Petroleum Storage Company in 1866 in the then- fledgling oil business. In 1874, the company, now known as Atlantic Refining, was purchased by John D. Rockefeller and integrated as part of Standard Oil. The acquisition gave Rockefeller a major presence on the East Coast in his growing empire. In 1886, after acquiring many other oil companies, the Standard Oil Trust organized territories for their companies. Atlantic's territory covered the entire state of Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and the southeasternmost corner of Pennsylvania, essentially giving Atlantic the entire Philadelphia area. Due to antitrust issues that would eventually lead to the demise of the Trust in 1911, Atlantic absorbed fellow Standards Acme Oil of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh-based Standard Oil (of Pennsylvania) in 1892. = Post-Standard years = As a result of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Standard Oil Trust was broken up, and Atlantic was one of 11 companies to acquire rights to the Standard name. (In all, 35 companies were formed from the breakup, the most notable ones without rights to the Standard name being the Ohio Oil Company, which became Marathon and South Penn Oil Company, which though various mergers and acquisitions became Pennzoil.) Atlantic's rights were in the entire states of Pennsylvania and Delaware, as it had given up the southern half of New Jersey to Jersey Standard (later Exxon, now ExxonMobil). However, like fellow baby Standard Conoco (now ConocoPhillips), Atlantic found more marketing power in its own name than the Standard name (a rarity at the time), and declined the option to use the name. The rights to the Standard name in Pennsylvania would be acquired by a newly formed Standard Oil of Pennsylvania, which would be acquired by Exxon in the late 1930s. ExxonMobil still owns the rights to the Standard name in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Over the years, Atlantic would expand up across the East Coast of the U.S., mainly through acquisitions. = The ARCO years = Trying to establish a national presence, Atlantic merged with West Coast oil company Richfield Oil in 1966. The combined company became known as the Atlantic Richfield Company, eventually being better known by its acronym ARCO. Also beginning in 1966, chiefly in the Delaware River basin urban regions of southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, ARCO sponsored a traffic- reporting service called \\"The ARCO Go Patrol,\\" originally it was the \\"Atlantic Go Patrol\\". While the merger with Richfield and eventual rebranding of the stations to ARCO was successful, it did essentially make the company a bi- coastal chain, having no presence from east of the Rocky Mountains to west of the Appalachian Mountains (save for Western Pennsylvania, since Atlantic was prominent in that state). This was remedied with the purchase of Sinclair Oil in 1969. To stay in compliance with antitrust laws, the Eastern assets of Sinclair as well as Atlantic's old assets in the Southeast were sold to BP. The remaining Sinclair service stations were rebranded as ARCO. = Revival and demise = The former Sinclair retail operations struggled, and ARCO abandoned its national ambitions, pulling out of a number of states beginning in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, ARCO began to find success in Richfield's old West Coast territory as a low-cost gasoline provider. In the early 1980s ARCO began blending methanol into its gasoline in the Northeast. Concerns over possible damage to automobile fuel systems limited consumer acceptance of the methanol blend and damaged the company's image. Management decided to concentrate on the West Coast market and ARCO sold off its Northeastern interests in 1985. Some were acquired by Shell, notably in New Jersey, but the larger portion went to a new company controlled by Dutch banker and oil trader John Deuss. The new company revived the Atlantic name, discontinued the use of methanol in its gasoline and launched its own convenience store brand, A-Plus. The new Atlantic struggled financially, and in 1988 was purchased by fellow Philadelphia oil company Sunoco. For the next few years Atlantic was marketed separately from Sunoco as a lower-cost brand, but by the mid-1990s Atlantic stations began to be rebranded as Sunoco outlets. The last known Atlantic station, in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, was rebranded as Sunoco in 1996. It is now a company-owned Sunoco station with Atlantic's old convenience store, A-Plus.  Legacy  Many remnants of Atlantic still show with both Sunoco and ARCO (which is now owned by Marathon Petroleum and still uses the ARCO name except in Northern California, Oregon and Washington, where BP continues to operate ARCO stations). Besides the obvious reference with ARCO, Sunoco retained the A-Plus convenience store chain since Sunoco didn't have a chain of its own. Because of Sunoco's sponsorship as the \\"Official Fuel of NASCAR\\", A-Plus is currently \\"The Official Pit Stop of NASCAR\\". In addition, Sunoco still owns the former Atlantic refinery in Philadelphia, and has consolidated it with the former Gulf Oil refinery (which Sunoco had acquired from Chevron) that was adjacent to the old Atlantic refinery. This Sunoco asset has since been reorganized as a separate company in which it holds a stake but is majority owned by Carlyle Group.

Most of the band's lineup also performed with The Holy Modal Rounders at one point.  Biography  Although songwriter and musician, Jeffrey Frederick, organized his first Clamtones band in Vermont during the early 1970s, the best-known incarnation of the band was based out of Portland, Oregon. The Clamtones usually comprised Frederick (vocals and guitar); Jill Gross (vocals); Robin Remaily (mandolin, fiddle, guitar, other strings); Richard Tyler (piano); Dave Reisch (bass); Teddy Deane (woodwinds and horns); and Roger North (drums). As the Clamtones, Gross, Reisch and Remaily joined Frederick, Peter Stampfel, Michael Hurley and friends on the 1976 Have Moicy! (Rounder Records). However, the definitive studio recording of the full band was the following year's Spiders In The Moonlight. Some of the tracks from that album and from Have Moicy! were included in the 2003 Rounder compilation album, I Make A Wish For A Potato. In 2007, the original album was digitally remastered, and three studio tracks from the later Jeffrey Frederick Band were added, and the work republished on CD as Resurrection of Spiders In The Moonlight. Jeffrey Frederick & The Clamtones B.C.

The Clamtones were part of an unusual arrangement in which the same band members played by that name when Frederick took the stage, but as the Holy Modal Rounders when Steve Weber fronted the band, typically as alternative sets in the same show. Weber's portion of the above-referenced Vancouver performance has been released as Steve Weber, The Holy Modal Rounders, B.C. (Frederick Productions, 2005).

It was held on Saturday and Sunday of Labor Day weekend. For many years it was held on the athletic field on the California State University, Long Beach campus. The 2009 festival, the 30th annual, was held at Rainbow Lagoon in downtown Long Beach. The Festival went on hiatus in 2010, and has not been held since. The festival was organized and used as a fund raiser by KKJZ, a publicly supported radio station on the CSULB campus broadcasting blues and jazz in Southern California. History The former Festival Site at CSULB campus (2003) John Lee Hooker performing at the Long Beach Blues Festival, California, August 31, 1997 The Festival was started in 1980 by jazz radio station KLON (later renamed to KKJZ) in Long Beach, California under the direction of Bernie Pearl, who was the host of a blues program \\"Nothing But The Blues\\" on KLON at the time. The first Festival was a one-day event titled the \\"KLON Blues & Gospel Festival\\" held at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach, drawing only a small crowd of 700, resulting in loss of $7,000 for the radio station. The Festival grew larger each year, becoming a major fund raising event for KLON. During 1996 through 2000, KLON expanded the event to 3 days utilizing the entire Labor Day weekend. It went back to the 2-day event in 2001 because CSULB wanted Labor Day to clean up the field for their use in the new school semester. The Festival venue for the second Fest and thereafter was the North Athletic Field at Cal State University, Long Beach (CSULB), with the exception of 1992 which was held at Shoreline Aquatic Park in downtown Long Beach, and at Rainbow Lagoon in downtown Long Beach beginning in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, the Blues Festival went on hiatus because of economic conditions and was replaced with a one-day 'Blues Bash', held at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center on the CSULB campus.

The most familiar members of the group are phytophagous, especially as gall-formers, though the actual majority of included species are parasitoids or hyperparasitoids. They are typically glossy, dark, smooth wasps with somewhat compressed bodies and somewhat reduced wing venation. It is common for various metasomal segments to be fused in various ways (often diagnostic for families or subfamilies), and the petiole is very short, when present. With the exception of the Cynipidae (the gall wasps), it is a poorly known group as a whole, though there are nearly 3000 known species in total, and a great many species are still undescribed, mostly in the Figitidae. Each of the constituent families differs in biology, though life histories of one of the families (Liopteridae) are still largely unknown.

It receives the flow of the upstream Boyds Corner empoundment, and, when needed, of Lake Gleneida, a controlled lake in the City supply system. Primarily, however, it receives water from the much larger Rondout Reservoir in the Catskill Mountains on the west bank of the Hudson River via the Delaware Aqueduct. It serves as a supplementary settling basin for these waters before releasing its flow back into the aqueduct to be carried to the Kensico Reservoir in southern Westchester County. West Branch Reservoir has a 20 square mile (32 km¬≤) drainage basin, and can hold up to of water at full capacity. It consists of two basins, separated by State Route 301. During drought periods the West Branch also receives water pumped in from the Hudson River by the City's Chelsea Pumping Station near Beacon in Dutchess County, some from New York City. It was used for this purpose during the 1965‚Äì66 and 1985 droughts, as well as during May 1989. Water withdrawn from the West Branch ordinarily flows via the Delaware Aqueduct to the Kensico Reservoir in Westchester County for further settling. There it mixes with additional Catskill system water carried by the Catskill Aqueduct before entering tunnels that carry it to the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, at the City's northern boundary. There it enters the city's direct water supply distribution system, flowing via tunnels through the boroughs of The Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The water finally stops at Staten Island. Water in excess of New York City's needs at the West Branch Reservoir goes over its spillway and into the West Branch Croton River, which is captured downstream by the Croton Falls Reservoir.

Adair George Washington Adair (March 1, 1823 ‚Äì September 29, 1899) was a real-estate developer in post Civil War Atlanta. Early life Adair was born of Scots-Irish parentage in rural Morgan County, Georgia. John F. Adair, his father, was a wheelwright, and in 1825, shortly after the birth of George, the family moved to DeKalb County. His mother died in 1835; his father sent him to Decatur to enter the employ of Green B. Butler as a store clerk. There he met James Calhoun, William H. Dabney, Charles Murphy and Ephraim M. Poole, who supported him with the means to study at the Decatur Academy. After two years, he took up the study of law in Covington, Georgia, and two years later he was admitted to the bar. To satisfy his debts, Adair took a position as a conductor on the Georgia Railroad, a job he held for four years. After leaving the railroad, he spent some time at Covington, and Charleston. Adair moved to Atlanta in 1854 at the age of 31 and there established what would be his permanent home. Career =Atlanta= Under the firm name of Adair and Ezzard, Adair embarked in the mercantile business, but after not entirely successful two years, he launched into the general trading, auctioning and real estate business, which would engage him throughout the remainder of his career. During the Civil War, Adair was a newspaperman and a cotton speculator. He already owned the Gate City Guardian newspaper when in 1861 he bought the Atlanta Southern Confederacy and merged the two keeping the name of the latter, assisted by J. Henly Smith. After the paper went under. Adair became an aide on the staff of Gen. N.B. Forrest, serving the confederacy until the end of hostilities in 1865. =Post war= Adair returned to Atlanta and resumed his real estate business. He began a political career which included positions on the Atlanta City Council and various committees. After co-founding the Atlanta Street Railway Company with Richard Peters in 1871 he began to develop areas at the same time they ran new streetcar lines to serve them: including West End and Adair Park. When the panic of 1873 came on he was compelled to make an assignment of all his property. In 1878, he sold his portion of the streetcar business to Peters. He started up again, becoming \\"connected\\" with the Atlanta Cotton Factory (on the site of the current CNN Center) and the Atlanta Cotton Exposition. He was director of the Kimball House Company, president of the Georgia Western Railroad, and director of the Piedmont Exposition. In the 1880s, real estate boomed again and with his sons, he established Adair and Company to develop suburban properties. With John W. Grant, in 1881 he developed what would become Stockbridge, Georgia. He also helped raise funds for the rebuilding of the Kimball House after it burned down. Later projects with Kimball failed: the subdivision of Peters Park in 1887 and the establishment of Kimball, Tennessee in 1890 both of which he auctioneered. Personal life Adair married Mary Jane Perry. Adair died at the age of 76, leaving his wife, and six children: Jack, Forrest, George, Sallie, Annie and Mary. Adair was first cousin to Green B. Adair, another Atlanta real estate developer.

The identification of Antiochus with the contemporary Antiochus Strategos, author of a narrative on the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem in 614, is disputed. The Greek original of the latter text is lost; the work is preserved in Georgian and Arabic versions. Antiochus is believed to have been born near Ancyra (now Ankara, Turkey). He lived first as a solitary, then became a monk and Abbot of the famous Lavra (monastery) of St. Saba near Jerusalem. He witnessed the Persian invasion of Palestine in 614, and the massacre of forty-four of his companions by the Bedouins. In 619, five years after the conquest of the Holy Land by Chosroes, Ancyra was taken and destroyed by the Persians, which compelled the monks of the neighbouring monastery of Attaline to leave their home, and to move from place to place. As they were, naturally, unable to carry many books with them, the Abbot Eustathius asked his friend Antiochus to compile an abridgment of Holy Scripture for their use, and also a short account of the martyrdom of the forty-four monks of St. Sabbas. In compliance with this request he wrote a work known as the Pandects of Holy Scripture (in 130 chapters, mistaken by the Latin translator for as many homilies). It is a collection of moral sentences, drawn from Scripture and from early ecclesiastical writers. He also wrote an Exomologesis or prayer, in which he relates the miseries that had befallen Jerusalem since the Persian invasion, and begs the divine mercy to heal the Holy City's many ills. These works seem to have been written in the period between the conquest of Palestine by Chosroes and its reconquest by the Emperor Heraclius in 628. The introductory chapter of the Pandects tells of the martyrdom referred to; its last chapter contains a list of heretics from Simon Magus to the Monophysite followers of Severus of Antioch. The book is of special value for its extracts of works no longer existing; the writer had an interest, then uncommon, in early Christian literature. In Eastern Orthodox liturgy, one of compline prayer is attributed to him .

Later years Over the years, Jamelske amassed over $1 million,http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/sexual_assault/john_jamelske/2.html which he invested in real estate in California. Jamelske's wife Dorothy became bedridden from disease in 1988 and died in 1999. Abductions In October 1988, Jamelske abducted his first victim, a 14-year-old Native American girl. He held her captive for over two years, and she had turned 17 by the time he released her. Jamelske compelled her to his will by threatening violence against her younger brother. She made no attempt to report to authorities after Jamelske released her. In either 1995 or 1996, Jamelske abducted a 14-year-old Latina runaway whom he lured under the premise of paying her to deliver a secret package. The girl willingly walked into his bunker (which he called \\"the dungeon\\") and Jamelske closed the door behind her. Eventually Jamelske put a blindfold on her and drove her to her mother's apartment and dropped her off. Although he also threatened her family, she went to the police with a description. Because of her previous drug use, they questioned the credibility of her story and dropped the investigation shortly after. On August 31, 1997, Jamelske kidnapped a 53-year-old Vietnamese woman off the street. She was a foreign refugee who spoke little English. He forced her into his car and took her to an abandoned house, where he raped her. Then he tied her to a stack of flattened cardboard boxes and drove her to his house. He raped her daily while holding her captive, and also forced her to fulfill various menial tasks for him. He released her on May 23, 1998 at a Greyhound bus station with $50. She reported to the police that day, but nothing came of it. She claimed that the police did not believe her, but Syracuse Police spokesman Sgt. Thomas Connellan stated that they investigated all leads, none of which panned out. On May 11, 2001, Jamelske offered a ride home to a 26-year-old white woman walking in downtown Syracuse while on LSD, which the woman accepted due to the poor weather. Jamelske took her back to his bunker, where he raped her daily. When she resisted, Jamelske inflicted cigar burns on her, from which she developed an abscess on her lower back. Jamelske also manipulated her with claims that he was actually part of an underground slavery syndicate, of which the police were a part. The victim wanted to write home to her parents letting them know she was alive, and while Jamelske did agree she could only do so in stating that she was in a drug rehabilitation clinic. Controversy over investigation After the previous victims' release, police investigations were complicated by the letter she had been forced by Jamelske to write. Further complicating the case was the rape kit test showing no evidence of sexual assault‚ÄîJamelske had no sexual contact with the victim for several days prior to releasing her. The victim also told police that he drove a tanDescribed as \\"orange\\" by the victim; Cold Case Files Episode 81: \\"A Man Scorned/The Dungeon\\" , aired 2/5/02. 1974 Mercury Comet. Police searched for registered vehicles matching this description in the New York area and came up with a single hit. However the lead didn't pan out due to the victim's description of the vehicle not matching with the one discovered.The detectives claimed that the victim was \\"so specific\\" about the make and color of the car. \\"It was checked, and it wasn't an orange car. She was so specific about: 'It was a '74 Mercury Comet, colored orange, I saw it, he showed me the registration ... ' That's what I went with; but we had nothing.\\" Det. Jack Schmidt, Onondaga Sheriff's Dept., Cold Case Files Episode 81: \\"A Man Scorned/The Dungeon\\" , aired 2/5/02. Due to this inconsistency, the investigating officers closed the case. It is noted that, despite that body style being available from 1971 to 1977, police failed to search any other year, as the car Jamelske drove was a 1975 Mercury Comet of the same color. Representatives from the Syracuse police appeared on Dateline NBC and criticized the woman for providing insufficient information. In another interview on the program Cold Case Files, an Onondaga Sheriff's Department detective stated: The victim claimed during the same program: Concerning the letter written by the victim to her family, the detective again stated: Discovery In October 2002, Jamelske picked up his final abductee, a 16-year-old African American runaway from Syracuse. On April 3, 2003, Jamelske felt confident enough to take the girl out to karaoke at a local bar. Emboldened by this success, he then took her on another public outing, where she slipped away from him long enough to phone her sister. The girl's sister checked the caller ID and dialed the number back, which turned out to be a bottle return center located in Manlius. The older sister persuaded the employee who answered the phone to call 9-1-1. The employee in turn called her boss, who was working at a local pet store several blocks away, telling him that Jamelske‚Äîwho was scheduled to visit him at the store shortly‚Äîhad apparently kidnapped a young girl and had been raping her. After Jamelske and the girl had made their visit and left, the boss immediately called the police; Jamelske was tracked down and arrested shortly thereafter. After discovery Jamelske pleaded guilty https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/nyregion/man-gets-18-years-to-life-for- holding-women-captive.html to five counts of first degree kidnapping, and is currently serving a term of 18 years to life. Part of his guilty plea agreement was that his assets would be sold off and divided among his victims. In a prison interview with MSNBC, Jamelske said that he should not be punished for what he did and that, once arrested, he had thought he would at the most spend a couple of days in jail, pay a fine, or perform community service. He said that his lawyers had to spend many days after his arrest to make it clear to him that taking women and holding them in a dungeon is kidnapping. In 2004, MSNBC produced episode 12 of their MSNBC Reports series subtitled \\"Sex Bunker\\" on the Jamelske case, periodically rebroadcast several times a year as part of their \\"doc block\\" documentary marathons. The case is also covered in the book True Stories of Law & Order: SVU: The Real Crimes Behind the Best Episodes of the Hit TV Show by Kevin Dwyer and Jur√© Fiorillo.New York: Berkley Boulevard Books, 2007. . Jamelske is currently housed in the Clinton Correctional Facility. =The \\"dungeon\\"= Police found Jamelske's residence to be systematically filled with miscellaneous items of little or no value: newspapers, magazines, beer bottles, receipts spanning two decades, etc. Further down into the basement, behind a storage shelf, police discovered the bunker in which Jamelske kept his victims: a steel door leading to an eight- foot-long tunnel which had to be traversed on hands and knees, leading to yet another steel door, which finally led to an high, long and wide room. The entry was a small box located just under the top of the room, so the person entering had to turn around and step down into the room via a small three rung ladder. Jamelske would tie his victims up with a chain that connected to an ankle bracelet. The dungeon had many things written on the wall, most notably religious phrases as well as numerous peace symbols. When police found the dungeon they contacted one of the known victims to link Jamelske to her testimony by asking what three words were written on the wall. She correctly responded \\"Wall of Thugs\\". A crucifix hung by the door, next to \\"PEACE TO ALL WHO ENTER HERE\\", as well as the words \\"HATE\\", \\"READY TO RUCUSS [sic], SO BRING ON THE PAIN\\" in deep crimson. In the center of the room was a stained bathtub on top of a raised wooden deck. It was here that the victims were forced to bathe using a garden hose. There was a drain plug but no plumbing. When the tub was drained, the water had nowhere to go but on the cement floor of the dungeon where it remained until it evaporated, making the room damp and moldy. An aluminum frame chair with no seat was positioned over a pail; a crude toilet that was used to further degrade the captives. A clock radio sat on top of a filthy portable refrigerator. Next to a yellow extension cord which ran out from a hole in the top of the walls was an eight inch (203 mm) aluminum hose that pumped warm air from the house furnace. There was also a series of calendars in which the victims systematically had to mark each day. Noted was the letters \\"B\\", \\"S\\", and \\"T\\" written on the dates. Investigators later discovered these letters were made by the victims who were made to record each date they were raped (S), bathed (B), or brushed their teeth (T). The collective timespan of the calendars covered 15 years. Police found several video recorded entries with at least one woman on the tape. In the tapes, the viewer can see Jamelske dancing, singing, and also exercising with said woman. Jamelske often told his captives that he was a part of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department and had shown a fake badge he had found on the street years earlier, as well as telling them that he was under certain bosses that were making him do this. He told his victims under this story that the easier the daily rapes could occur the faster his bosses might let the girls out. In the video tape police found, the viewer can see the victim pleading with the potential \\"bosses\\" that it would be better if she were home. All of Jamelske's victims were of different ethnic origins: Native American, Latino, Vietnamese, black, and white.

Biography A native of Senigallia, Antonelli was the nephew of Cardinal Nicol√≤ Maria Antonelli. During the early part of his long diplomatic career, he held, among other offices, those of canon of the Vatican Basilica, Prefect of archives in the Castle of San Angelo, Secretary of the Sacred College and Assessor of the Holy Office. He was created Cardinal Priest of Santa Sabina by Pope Pius VI in the consistory of 24 April 1775, and later Dean of the Sacred College and Cardinal Bishop of Ostia-Velletri. At the time of the French Revolution, with a view to preventing the suspension of church services, he lent his support to the vote for the civil constitution of the French clergy, decreed by the National Assembly of France (12 July 1790). In addition to the responsible posts already mentioned, he filled those of grand penitentiary, prefect of the Signature of Justice and of the Congregation of the Index, and pro-secretary of Briefs. He assisted in the preparation of the Concordat, and was present at the election of Pope Pius VII in 1800, whom he later accompanied to Paris in 1804. He participated in the Coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of the French. In 1808, he was banished from Rome by the French to Spoleto and later to Sinigaglia, where he died, leaving to the Congregation of Propaganda bequests for the support of twelve Armenian students in the College of Urbano. Though Antonelli has been criticized for arrogating to the papacy too arbitrary a civil power, a perusal of his letter to the bishops of Ireland reveals a more tolerant spirit than is generally attributed to him. Possessed of a rich library, he was the friend and protector of letters, and had as librarian, the learned Francesco Cancellieri. He also acquired some fame as an archaeologist.

Fire Island is a long island in the U.S. state of Alaska, located near the head of Cook Inlet at . It is the only island in the Municipality of Anchorage, sitting three miles (5 km) off the city's Point Campbell, and nine miles (14.5 km) from downtown. Its land area is 17.467 km2 (6.7439 sq mi, or 4,316.1 acres), and there was no permanent resident population at the 2000 census. Geology Fire Island is underlain by sedimentary rocks, atop which lie deep sand and gravel deposits from the surrounding tidal estuary.Nakanishi, Allan S. Overview of Environmental and Hydrogeologic Conditions on Fire Island, Anchorage, Alaska. Anchorage, Alaska: U.S. Geological Survey, 1995. Retrieved September 15, 2013. The island is ringed by steep bluffs that average about high, and the land elevation ranges from 25‚Äì90 above sea level. At low tide, it is possible to walk across the mud flats of the Cook Inlet to reach Fire Island. Hikers occasionally attempt the 3.5-mile (5.6-km) trek from Kincaid Park, but the incoming tide can make the journey dangerous, and people have been known to drown. The island is dominated by forests similar to those found in the Alaskan interior, and bogs are found in poorly drained low-lying areas. Small areas of tidal marshes and salt grasses exist in the west and northeast. There is little fresh water on Fire Island, since there are only a few small lakes and the water table is prone to salt-water intrusion. History The island's Dena‚Äôina name is Nutu≈Ç‚Äôiy, or \\"object that stands in the water\\". Europeans first saw the island during Captain Cook's expedition up what was named the Cook Inlet. Cook's men landed on the island and named it \\"Currant Island.\\" Later, George Vancouver called it \\"Turnagain Island\\" in 1794, after the Turnagain Arm, which the southeast side of the island faces. In 1847, the Russian Hydrographical Department published Chart 1378, which named the island Ostrov Mushukhli (Mushukhli Island), possibly an approximation of Nutu≈Ç‚Äôiy. \\"Fire Island\\" had become established by 1895, when that name was published by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. A Dena‚Äôina elder reported that a village had once existed in Fire Island, but an epidemic forced the survivors to move south to Point Possession, across the Turnagain Arm on the Kenai Peninsula, sometime before 1934. Nonetheless, Fire Island was the site of Dena‚Äôina fish camps from 1918 until the 1970s. From 1909 to 1955, the island was designated as a breeding ground for Alaska moose. During World War II, the U.S. Army used it as an observation point to guard against Japanese submarines. Fire Island Air Force Station = Fire Island Air Force Station = In September 1951, the U.S. Air Force 626th Airborne Control and Warning Squadron was established on the island at a base on its southern end called Fire Island Air Force Station. Staffed by about 200 personnel, the base was an air defense radar center and Nike surface-to-air missile site for NORAD, doubling as a Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control radar and communications site. Since the island is not connected to the mainland, all supplies came by helicopter from Elmendorf Air Force Base and, during summer, by barge from Anchorage. A runway was built during the first years of the base's existence; however, during the 1964 Alaska earthquake ‚Äì one of the largest in recorded history ‚Äì the airfield subsided into the ocean, leaving helicopter as the only way of reaching the island by air. Fire Island AFS closed in 1969, leaving the FAA as the sole user of the island. The base site was cleaned up in the 1990s, and the facilities razed. The FAA site stayed open until 1980, when new Kenai-based radar became active. In 1982, the site of the old air station was turned over to the native corporation Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI) as federal surplus property.Cook Inlet Land Exchange 30 Years (Special Edition). CIRI Newsletter (Oct. 2006): page 6. Retrieved September 12, 2013. Currently, CIRI owns 90% of Fire Island's 4,000 acres, the rest belonging to the FAA and the US Coast Guard. The FAA maintains a private general aviation airfield on the east corner of the island, which has two runways and hosts, on average, 25 landings and takeoffs each month. Access to the island is by permission only. Wind farm At present, there is an 11-turbine, 17.6-megawatt wind farm located on Fire Island. The installation is owned and operated by Fire Island Wind LLC, a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI), the owners of the island. The turbines‚Äô nacelles rise to above the ground, about the height of Anchorage's Robert B. Atwood Building, which is the city's second-tallest. An underwater transmission line connects the wind farm to the Anchorage power grid. The wind farm is the first megawatt-scale wind project in Southcentral Alaska. According to the producers, the installation powers 5,600 homes in Anchorage. Though the FAA currently permits only 11 turbines, the farm has the capacity to triple in size to 33. =Project history= Since the abandonment of the air force station, various uses had been suggested for the island, including an expansion of the Port of Anchorage or the development of industrial facilities. Although drinking-water supplies were judged insufficient to support commercial or industrial development, in the early 1990s the utility Chugach Electric determined that Fire Island is a favorable location for a wind farm. Deciding factors included not just strong and steady winds, but also proximity to the Anchorage area and lack of conflicting land-use issues. In 2000, Chugach Electric approached CIRI, the owners of Fire Island, with a proposal that CIRI build a wind farm there and sell the electricity to the Anchorage power grid. Measurements taken over the next several years reconfirmed the site's viability for producing commercial wind power. The FAA, operators of nearby Anchorage International Airport, cautiously approved the project in 2008 after deciding that the wind turbines would not interfere with their radar equipment. Work on the installation commenced in 2009, and construction of the turbines themselves took place over the summer of 2012. On September 24, 2012, all 11 turbines began feeding into the Anchorage electrical grid.

After receiving a master's degree in 1897, Johnson taught in public schools, then worked in a bank for five years, before returning to teaching at Bryant and Stratton Business School in Providence, Rhode Island (now Bryant University). It was there she teamed up with her old Pennsylvania Normal School classmate Mary T. Wales, who was also teaching at Bryant, to found their own business school. School founder In 1914, with fellow teacher Mary T. Wales, she co-founded Johnson & Wales Business School in Providence, Rhode Island. It has grown into the present-day Johnson & Wales University, with four campuses in the United States. Retirement and death With Mary in poor health, the two women sold the business school in June 1947 and retired together in Warwick, Rhode Island. Mary died of cancer in 1952. After Mary's death, Gertrude returned to her hometown of Norristown, Pennsylvania and died there in 1961.

Description and uses It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 15‚Äì35 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 m, and a conical crown with drooping branchlets. The shoots are orange-brown, with variably scattered to dense pubescence. The leaves are needle-like, 1‚Äì2 cm long, rhombic in cross-section, shiny green to grayish- green with inconspicuous stomatal lines; the leaves subtending a bud are distinctively angled out at a greater angle than the rest of the leaves (a character shared by only two or three other spruces). The cones are cylindric- conic, 5‚Äì10 cm long and 1.5‚Äì2 cm broad, green or purple, maturing glossy brown 4‚Äì6 months after pollination, and have stiff, smoothly rounded scales. It is an important timber tree in Russia, the wood being used for general construction and paper making. The leaves are used to make spruce beer. Siberian spruce cone-scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth Cydia illutana. Taxonomy and systematics Siberian spruce and Norway spruce (Picea abies) have turned out to be extremely similar genetically and might be considered two closely related subspecies of P. abies. Siberian spruce hybridises extensively with Norway spruce where the two species (or subspecies) meet in northeastern Europe; trees over a broad area from extreme northeast Norway and Sweden, northern Finland east to the Ural Mountains are classified as the hybrid Picea √ó fennica (Regel) Komarov (or P. abies subsp. √ófennica, if the two taxa are considered subspecies); they differ from typical P. obovata from east of the Urals in having cones with less smoothly rounded, often triangular-pointed, scales.

A circumhorizontal arc is an optical phenomenon that belongs to the family of ice halos formed by the refraction of sun- or moonlight in plate-shaped ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, typically in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. In its full form, the arc has the appearance of a large, brightly spectrum-coloured band (red being the topmost colour) running parallel to the horizon, located far below the Sun or Moon. The distance between the arc and the Sun or Moon is twice as far as the common 22-degree halo. Often, when the halo-forming cloud is small or patchy, only fragments of the arc are seen. As with all halos, it can be caused by the Sun as well as (but much more rarely) the Moon.http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz643.htm Other currently accepted names for the circumhorizontal arc are circumhorizon arc or lower symmetric 46¬∞ plate arc.Tape, Walter and Moilanen, Jarmo - 'Atmospheric Halos & the search for angle x', American geophysical Union,2006 - pp196-7 The misleading term \\"fire rainbow\\" is sometimes used to describe this phenomenon, although it is neither a rainbow, nor related in any way to fire. The term, apparently coined in 2006, may originate in the occasional appearance of the arc as \\"flames\\" in the sky, when it occurs in fragmentary cirrus clouds. Formation The halo is formed by sunlight entering horizontally-oriented, flat, hexagonal ice crystals through a vertical side face and leaving through the near horizontal bottom face (plate thickness does not affect the formation of the halo). In principle, Parry oriented column crystals may also produce the arc, although this is rare. The 90¬∞ inclination between the ray entrance and exit faces produce the well-separated spectral colours. The arc has a considerable angular extent and thus, rarely is complete. When only fragments of a cirrus cloud are in the appropriate sky and sun position, they may appear to shine with spectral colours. Frequency How often a circumhorizontal arc is seen, depends on the location and the latitude of the observer. In the United States it is a relatively common halo, seen several times each summer in any one place. In contrast, it is a rare phenomenon in northern Europe for several reasons. Apart from the presence of ice-containing clouds in the right position in the sky, the halo requires that the light source (Sun or Moon) be very high in the sky, at an elevation of 58¬∞ or greater. This means that the solar variety of the halo is impossible to see at locations north of 55¬∞N or south of 55¬∞S. A lunar circumhorizon arc might be visible at other latitudes, but is much rarer since it requires a nearly full Moon to produce enough light. At other latitudes the solar circumhorizontal arc is visible, for a greater or lesser time, around the summer solstice. Slots of visibility for different latitudes and locations may be looked up here. For example, in London, England the sun is only high enough for 140 hours between mid-May and late July, whereas Los Angeles has the sun higher than 58 degrees for 670 hours between late March and late September. Artificial circumhorizontal arcs A water glass experiment (known about since at least 1920) may be modified slightly to create an artificial circumhorizontal arc. Illuminating under a very steep angle from below the side face of a nearly completely water-filled cylindrical glass will refract the light into the water. The glass should be situated at the edge of a table. The second refraction at the top water-air interface will then project a hyperbola at a vertical wall behind it. The overall refraction is then equivalent to the refraction through an upright hexagonal plate crystal when the rotational averaging is taken into account. A colorful artificial circumhorizontal arc will then appear projected on the wall. Using a spherical projection screen instead will result in a closer analogy to the natural halo counterpart. Other artificial halos can be created by similar means. Similar optical phenomena Circumhorizontal arcs, especially when only fragments can be seen, are sometimes confused with cloud iridescence. This phenomenon also causes clouds to appear multi-coloured, but it originates from diffraction (typically by liquid water droplets or ice crystals) rather than refraction. The two phenomena can be distinguished by several features. Firstly, a circumhorizon arc always has a fixed location in the sky in relation to the Sun or Moon (namely below it at an angle of 46¬∞), while iridescence can occur in different positions (often directly around the Sun or Moon). Secondly, the colour bands in a circumhorizon arc always run horizontally with the red on top, while in iridescence they are much more random in sequence and shape, which roughly follows the contours of the cloud that causes it. Finally, the colours of a circumhorizon arc are pure and spectral (more so than in a rainbow), while the colours in cloud iridescence have a more washed-out, \\"mother of pearl\\" appearance. Confusion with other members of the halo family, such as sun dogs or the circumzenithal arc, may also arise, but these are easily dismissed by their entirely different positions in relation to the Sun or Moon. More difficult is the distinction between the circumhorizontal arc and the infralateral arc, both of which almost entirely overlap when the Sun or Moon is at a high elevation. The difference is that the circumhorizontal arc always runs parallel to the horizon (although pictures typically show it as a curved line due to perspective distortion), whereas the infralateral arc curves upward at its ends.

As fundamentally an action of thanksgiving to God it is called Eucharist, which means thanksgiving. Other terms for it are Lord's Supper, Breaking of Bread, Eucharistic assembly, memorial of the Lord's Passion and Resurrection, holy sacrifice of the Mass, Holy and Divine Liturgy, Sacred Mysteries, Most Blessed Sacrament, Holy Communion, the holy things (ta hagia; sancta), and finally Holy Mass from the sending forth (missio) of the faithful. This is the central liturgical rite in the Catholic Church encompassing the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, where the bread and wine are consecrated and become the body and blood of Christ. As defined by the Church at the Council of Trent, in the Mass, \\"The same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross, is present and offered in an unbloody manner.\\" John Hardon, Modern Catholic Dictionary The Church describes the Holy Mass as \\"the source and summit of the Christian life\\". It teaches that through consecration by an ordained priest the bread and wine become the sacrificial body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ as the sacrifice on Calvary made truly present once again on the altar. The Catholic Church permits only baptised members in the state of grace (Catholics who have recently confessed all mortal sins) to receive Christ in the Eucharist. Many of the Catholic Church's other sacraments, such as Confirmation, Holy Orders, and Holy Matrimony, are now generally administered within the framework of the Holy Mass, but before the Second Vatican Council were often or even usually administered outside of Mass. The term \\"Mass\\" is commonly used of celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin Church, while the various Eastern Rites use terms such as \\"Divine Liturgy\\", \\"Holy Qurbana\\", and \\"Badarak\\", in accordance with each one's tradition. Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum authorized under certain conditions continued use of the 1962 form of the Roman Rite as the Extraordinary Form, while the post-Vatican II form promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 and revised by Pope John Paul II in 2002 is the Ordinary Form of the Roman RitePope Benedict XVI, Letter to the Bishops, 7 July 2007quote=use of the 1962 Missal as a Forma extraordinaria of the liturgy of the Mass The term \\"Mass\\" is derived from the concluding words of the Roman Rite Mass in Latin: \\"Ite, missa est\\" (\\"Go; it is the dismissal\\"). The Late Latin word missa substantively corresponds to the classical Latin word missio. In antiquity, missa simply meant \\"dismissal\\". In Christian usage, however, it gradually took on a deeper meaning. The word \\"dismissal\\" has come to imply a mission.  The Nature of Sacrifice  The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is the fulfillment of all of the sacrifices of the Old Covenant. In the New Covenant, the one sacrifice on the altar of Calvary is revisited during each and every Catholic Mass. Jesus Christ merited all graces and blessings for us by His death on the Cross. These merits form an inexhaustible fountain of grace to nourish the supernatural life of souls. At Calvary, Christ not only merited all graces for us but also established certain channels whereby these graces may be obtained. These channels are the Sacrifice of the Mass and the other Sacraments. The first Mass was instituted by Christ at the Last Supper, on the first Holy Thursday. The first Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was celebrated on the eve of the Passion. The unbloody sacrifice of the Last Supper is a memorial of Christ's bloody sacrifice on the cross. Thus, the Mass is a unifying event of the Last Supper and Christ's sacrifice on Calvary. The Mass contains the four essential elements of a true sacrifice: priest, victim, altar, and sacrifice. Its Priest, Jesus Christ, uses the ministry of an earthly representative; its Victim, Jesus Christ, truly present under the appearances of bread and wine; its altar; and the Sacrifice is a mystic representation of the blood-shedding of Calvary. Thus, the Mass is offered for four ends: adoration, atonement, thanksgiving, and petition.  History of the Roman Catholic Mass  The Roman Rite Mass, the predominant form of its celebration in the Catholic Church, is the focus of this article. For information on the theology of the Eucharist and on the Eucharistic liturgy of other Christian denominations, see \\"Mass (liturgy)\\", \\"Eucharist\\" and \\"Eucharistic theology\\". For information on the history development of the Mass see Eucharist and Origin of the Eucharist. The classic study of the Mass is that of Josef Andreas Jungmann, the two-volume Mass of the Roman Rite or Missarum Solemnia. Paul F. Bradshaw and Maxwell E. Johnson trace the history of eucharistic liturgies from first-century shared meals of Christian communities, which became associated with the Last Supper, to second and third-century rites mentioned by Pliny the Younger and Ignatius of Antioch and described by Justin Martyr and others, in which passages from Scripture were read and the use of bread and wine was no longer associated with a full meal.The Eucharistic Liturgies: Their Evolution and Interpretation. Liturgical Press; 2012. . pp=1‚Äì59. When in the fourth century Christianity was granted the status of a legal religion and was even viewed with favour by the Roman Emperors, the Christian celebrations took on a more formal appearance and were embellished by the use of vestments, lights and incense. Ex tempore prayers by the presider gave way to texts previously approved by synods of bishops as a guarantee of the orthodoxy of the content, leading to the formation of liturgical forms or \\"rites\\" generally associated with influential episcopal sees.Bradshaw and Johnson (2012), pp. 70‚Äì71 The Roman Catholic Church encompasses a considerable number of such liturgical rites. Apart from the Latin liturgical rites, Mass in the Catholic Church is celebrated according to the Byzantine Rite in various languages based on Greek texts of the Church of Constantinople; the Alexandrian Rite used by the Coptic Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church and the Ethiopian Catholic Church; the Antiochene Rite used by the Maronite Church, the Syriac Catholic Church and the Syro- Malankara Catholic Church; the East Syriac Rite used by the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church; and the Armenian Rite used by the Armenian Catholic Church. = The Roman-Rite Mass = Within the Latin Church, the Roman Rite Mass is by far the most widely used liturgical rite. The history of the development of the Mass of this rite comprises the Pre- Tridentine Mass, the Tridentine Mass and the post-Vatican II Mass. The Pre- Tridentine Mass of the Roman Rite was adopted even north of the Alps (but often modified by non-Roman influences) even before the time of Charlemagne, who wished it to be used throughout his empire, but the text actually distributed incorporated many Gallican additions. Roman missionaries, such as Boniface and Augustine of Canterbury introduced the Roman Mass to Germany and England. It was accepted also in Ireland, but met greater opposition in Spain and Milan.Adrian Fortescue. The Mass: A Study of the Roman Liturgy. Longmans Green & Co; 1917. . p. 177‚Äì180. In accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), Pope Pius V in 1570 enforced use of the Tridentine Mass in the Latin Church. Before the invention of printing, each diocese of the Latin Church could and often did have its own particular Rite of Mass, generally but not necessarily based on the Roman Rite; but Pius V made his revision of the Roman Missal mandatory throughout the Latin Church, permitting continuance of other rites only if they had been in existence for at least 200 years. The Second Vatican Council also decreed a revision of the Roman Missal, which was put into effect by Pope Paul VI in 1969.  Contemporary Roman-Rite Mass  The following description of the celebration of Mass, usually in the local vernacular language, is limited to the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite. This form, promulgated at the request of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) by Pope Paul VI in 1969 and revised by Pope John Paul II in 2002, replaced the Tridentine Mass originally promulgated in 1570 in accordance with decrees of the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì46). The 1962 form of the Tridentine Mass, in the Latin language alone, may be employed as the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document Summorum Pontificum. In the Ordinary form the priest usually (though not obligatorily) faces the people (versus populum); in the Extraordinary Form the priest most often faces in the same direction as the people, towards the apse of the church, a stance that since the twentieth century is often called ad orientem, although not necessarily eastward. As mentioned, the Eucharistic liturgy is celebrated in the Catholic Church also in other Latin liturgical rites and in those of the Eastern Catholic Churches. The Catechism of the Catholic Church discusses the importance of the Mass in the Catholic tradition under the headings: :I. The Eucharist - Source and Summit of Ecclesial Life :II. What is This Sacrament Called? :III. The Eucharist in the Economy of Salvation :IV. The Liturgical Celebration of the Eucharist :V. The Sacramental Sacrifice Thanksgiving, Memorial, Presence :VI. The Paschal Banquet :VII. The Eucharist - \\"Pledge of the Glory To Come\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1322‚Äì1405 =Liturgical books= The Roman Missal contains the prayers, antiphons and rubrics of the Mass. The Lectionary presents passages from the Bible arranged in the order for reading at each day's Mass. Compared with the scripture readings in the pre-1970 Missal, the modern Lectionary contains a much wider variety of passages, too many to include in the Missal. A Book of the Gospels, also called the Evangeliary,General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM), paragraph 44 is recommended for the reading from the Gospels, but where this book is not available the Lectionary is used in its place. The most frequently celebrated (\\"ordinary\\") form of the Roman-Rite Mass is that indicated in post- Vatican II editions of the Roman Missal.\\"The Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II, obviously is and continues to be the normal Form ‚Äì the Forma ordinaria ‚Äì of the Eucharistic Liturgy\\". Letter of Pope Benedict to the Bishops, 7 July 2007, paragraph 5 What, in the circumstances indicated in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, may be celebrated as an \\"extraordinary form\\" of the Roman Rite is indicated in the 1962 edition, which also contains the assigned Scripture readings, then much less numerous than in the revised form. Structure of Mass The Eucharistic celebration is \\"one single act of worship\\" but consists of different elements, which always include \\"the proclamation of the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine, which signifies also our own transformation into the body of Christ;1 Corinthians 10:17 and participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's body and blood\\". Within the fixed structure of the Roman-Rite Mass outlined below, the \\"proper\\" or daily- varying parts are the Scripture readings and responsorial psalm, the antiphons at the entrance and communion processions, and the texts of the three prayers known as the collect, the prayer over the gifts, and the prayer after communion. These convey themes from the liturgical season, the feast days of titles or events in the life of Christ, the feast days and commemorations of the saints, or for Masses for particular circumstances (e.g., funeral Masses, Masses for the celebration of Confirmation, Masses for peace, to begin the academic year, etc.). =Introit, Procession, and Introductory Rites= The priest enters in procession into the nave with altar servers, and with a deacon if there is one. The deacon may carry the Evangelion (Gospel book), which he will place on the altar; and one altar server, called the crucifer, carries a processional cross at the front of the procession. Other servers may carry blessed candles, incense and a thurible. During this procession, ordinarily, the entrance chant or hymn is sung.\\"The antiphon with its Psalm from the Graduale Romanum or the Graduale Simplex, or another chant ... whose text has been approved by the Conference of Bishops\\". GIRM, paragraph 48 If there is no singing at the entrance, the entrance antiphon is recited either by some or all of the faithful or by a lector; otherwise it is said by the priest himself.GIRM, paragraph 256 When the procession arrives at the sanctuary, all bow toward the altar. The priest and other ordained ministers kiss the altar. Then, when the priest arrives at his chair, he leads the assembly in making the Sign of the Cross, saying: \\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\\" to which the faithful answer: \\"Amen.\\" Then the priest \\"signifies the presence of the Lord to the community gathered there by means of the Greeting. By this Greeting and the response of the faithful, the mystery of the Church gathered together is made manifest.\\"GIRM, paragraph 50 The greetings are derived from the Pauline epistles. Altar of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Rome. Then the priest invites those present to take part in the Penitential Act, of which the Missal proposes three forms, the first of which is the Confiteor. One form includes tropes acclaiming God's deeds on our behalf, and the priest has some freedom in formulating these. This is concluded with the priest's prayer of absolution, \\"which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance.\\"GIRM, paragraph 51 It does absolve venial sins, however. \\"From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter Time, instead of the customary Penitential Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may take place as a reminder of Baptism.\\" This ceremony, in which the congregation is cleansed with holy water, is known as the Asperges. \\"After the Penitential Act, the Kyrie, Eleison (Lord, have mercy) is always begun, unless it has already been part of the Penitential Act. Since it is a chant by which the faithful acclaim the Lord and implore his mercy, it is usually executed by everyone, that is to say, with the faithful and the choir or cantor taking part in it.\\"GIRM, paragraph 52 The Kyrie may be sung or recited in the vernacular language or in the original Greek.Roman Missal, \\"The Order of Mass\\", 7 It is the only portion of the Mass in Greek instead of Latin or Latinised Hebrew. \\"The Gloria in Excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is a most ancient and venerable hymn by which the Church, gathered in the Holy Spirit, glorifies and entreats God the Father and the Lamb. ...It is sung or said on Sundays outside Advent and Lent, and also on Solemnities and Feasts, and at particular celebrations of a more solemn character.\\"GIRM, paragraph 53 The Gloria is omitted at requiem Masses (funerals and Masses for the dead) on ordinary feast-days of saints, weekdays, and Votive Masses. It is also optional, in line with the perceived degree of solemnity of the occasion, at Ritual Masses such as those celebrated for Marriage (\\"Nuptial Mass\\"), Confirmation or Religious Profession, at Masses on the Anniversary of Marriage or Religious Profession, and at Masses for Various Needs and Occasions. \\"Next the Priest calls upon the people to pray and everybody, together with the Priest, observes a brief silence so that they may become aware of being in God‚Äôs presence and may call to mind their intentions. Then the Priest pronounces the prayer usually called the ‚ÄúCollect‚Äù and through which the character of the celebration finds expression.\\"GIRM, paragraph 54 =Liturgy of the Word= A deacon On Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the Old Testament (a term wider than Hebrew Scriptures, since it includes the Deuterocanonical Books), or the Acts of the Apostles during Eastertide. The first reading is followed by a Responsorial Psalm, a complete Psalm or a sizeable portion of one. A cantor, choir or lector leads, and the congregation sings or recites a refrain. \\"That the people may be able to sing the Psalm response more readily, texts of some responses and Psalms have been chosen for the various seasons of the year or for the various categories of Saints. These may be used in place of the text corresponding to the reading whenever the Psalm is sung.\\"GIRM, paragraph 61 The second reading is from the New Testament, typically from one of the Pauline epistles. The reader begins most reading with the introductory statement \\"a reading from the Book of...\\" or \\"a reading from the Letter to...,\\" and concludes each reading by proclaiming that the reading is \\"the word of the Lord,\\"; the congregation responds by saying \\"Thanks be to God.\\" The lector will usually be a scheduled volunteer from among the congregation; when two non-Gospel readings are given, they may be given by two different lectors or by one, according to local preference. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the Gospel. This is preceded by the singing of the Gospel Acclamation, typically an Alleluia with a verse of Scripture, which may be omitted if not sung. Alleluia is replaced during Lent by a different acclamation of praise. All stand while the Gospel is chanted or read by a deacon or, if none is available, by a priest. The reading is traditionally introduced with the phrase \\"a reading from the Holy Gospel according to\\" followed by the evangelist's name. To conclude the Gospel reading, the priest or deacon proclaims: \\"The Gospel of the Lord\\" and the faithful respond, \\"Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\\" The priest or deacon then kisses the book.Roman Missal, \\"The Order of Mass\\", 16 If a deacon participates, he reads the Gospel. If a deacon is not present, the celebrating priest or a concelebrant, if there is one, proclaims it.Roman Missal, \\"The Order of Mass\\", 14 At least on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, a homily, a sermon that draws upon some aspect of the readings or of the liturgy, is then given. Ordinarily the priest celebrant himself gives the homily, but he may entrust it to a concelebrating priest or to the deacon, but never to a lay person. In particular cases and for a just cause, a bishop or priest who is present but cannot concelebrate may give the homily. On days other than Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, the homily, though not obligatory, is recommended.GIRM, paragraph 66 On Sundays and solemnities, all then profess their Christian faith by reciting or singing the Nicene Creed or, especially from Easter to Pentecost, the Apostles' Creed, which is particularly associated with baptism and is often used in Masses for children. The Liturgy of the Word concludes with the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful. The priest begins it with a brief introduction, then a deacon, a cantor, or another lay person announces some intentions for prayer, to which the congregation responds with a short invocation such as \\"Lord hear our prayer.\\" The priest concludes with a longer prayer. =Liturgy of the Eucharist= Grotto of the Annunciation, Nazareth. The linen corporal is spread over the center of the altar, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the ceremonial placing on it of bread and wine. These may be brought to the altar in a procession, especially if Mass is celebrated with a large congregation.\\"It is a praiseworthy practice for the bread and wine to be presented by the faithful.\\" GIRM, paragraph 73 The unleavened, wheat bread (in the tradition of the Latin Church)GIRM, paragraph 320 is placed on a paten, and the wine (from grapes) is put in a chalice and mixed with a little water, As the priest places each on the corporal, he says a silent prayer over each individually, which, if this rite is unaccompanied by singing, he is permitted to say aloud, in which case the congregation responds to each prayer with: \\"Blessed be God forever.\\" Then the priest washes his hands, \\"a rite in which the desire for interior purification finds expression.\\"GIRM, paragraph 76 The congregation, which has been seated during this preparatory rite, rises, and the priest gives an exhortation to pray: \\"Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\\" The congregation responds: \\"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of his name, for our good, and the good of all his holy Church.\\" The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts. The Eucharistic Prayer, \\"the centre and high point of the entire celebration\\",GIRM, paragraph 78 then begins with a dialogue between priest and the faithful. This dialogue opens with the normal liturgical greeting, \\"The Lord be with you\\", but in view of the special solemnity of the rite now beginning, the priest then exhorts the faithful: \\"Lift up your hearts.\\" The faithful respond with: \\"We lift them up to the Lord.\\" The priest then introduces the great theme of \\"Eucharist\\", a word originating in the Greek word for giving thanks: \\"Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\\" The faithful join in this sentiment, saying: \\"It is right and just.\\" The priest continues with one of many thematic Eucharistic Prayer prefaces, which lead to the Sanctus acclamation: \\"Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.\\" In some countries, including the United States, the faithful kneel immediately after the singing or recitation of the Sanctus. If a person is unable to kneel, he makes a profound bow after the Consecration\\"The faithful [...] should kneel [...] at the Consecration, except when prevented on occasion by ill health, or for reasons of lack of space, of the large number of people present, or for another reasonable cause. However, those who do not kneel ought to make a profound bow when the Priest genuflects after the Consecration.\\" GIRM, paragraph 43 ‚Äì the Institution Narrative that recalls Jesus' words and actions at his Last Supper: \\"Take this, all of you, and eat of it: for this is my body which will be given up for you. ...Take this, all of you, and drink from it: for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\\"; In many places, a consecrated bell is rung after the elevation of each element. The tradition of raising the host and chalice high after the Consecration has its origin in the ad orientem celebration of the Mass, and is done so that the people may more readily see the Host. It is also customary on solemnities and other days for the altar servers to offer incense to the Host and chalice during the elevation. The priest then announces: \\"The mystery of faith,\\" and the faithful respond with an acclamation, using one of three prescribed formulae.GIRM, paragraph 151 Mass at the Grotto at Lourdes. The chalice is displayed to the faithful immediately after the consecration of the wine. The Eucharistic Prayer includes the Epiclesis (which since early Christian times the Eastern churches have seen as the climax of the Consecration), praying that the Holy Spirit might transform the elements of bread and wine and thereby the people into one body in Christ.GIRM, paragraph 79c,f The whole portion of the Antiphon recalling Christ's passion, death, and resurrection, is called the Anamnesis. Intercessions for both the living and the souls in Purgatory follow. When there are priests concelebrating the Mass they join the main celebrant in the central prayers, up to the intercessions, which they may divide among themselves. The Antiphon ends with an emphatic doxology for which the priest elevates the paten with the Host and the deacon (if there is one) elevates the chalice, and the priest(s) proclaim of Christ that \\"through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy spirit, all glory and honor is yours, Almighty Father, for ever and ever,\\" to which the faithful sing or chant the great Amen. This Amen is the faithful's assent to all that God has wrought through the consecration and re-presention of the sacrifice of Christ. Both the doxology and Great Amen are preferably sung or chanted. This is in line with the Instruction on Music in the Liturgy which says: \\"One cannot find anything more religious and more joyful in sacred celebrations than a whole congregation expressing its faith and devotion in song. Therefore the active participation of the whole people, which is shown in singing, is to be carefully promoted. ...It should first of all include acclamations, responses to the greetings of the priest and ministers and to the prayers of litany form, and also antiphons and psalms, refrains or repeated responses, hymns and canticles.\\" =Communion rite= Reception of Holy Communion The communion rite begins with a number of preparatory rites, of which the singing or recitation of the Our Father is the first. In the context of this preparation, the petitions for the daily bread and the forgiveness of trespasses gain particular significance. After an invitation by priest to do so, priest and people together recite the Lord's Prayer. The priest adds to it a development of the final petition, known as the embolism: \\"Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\\" The faithful then recite the doxology, \\"For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever\\".GIRM, paragraphs 80‚Äì81 During the joint recitation of the Lord's Prayer the priest is exceptionally directed to extend his hands in the orans position. In the liturgy, the priest normally adopts this posture only when praying aloud and alone while the congregation is silent. Other prayers said by the priest with the people, like the Holy, Holy in every Mass, are said with joined hands. This exception was introduced by Pope Pius XII, who only in the context of his Holy Week liturgical reforms permitted the congregation to join the priest in praying the Pater noster, provided that they could pray it in Latin.Edward Peters, \\"Another Look at the Orans Issue\\" in CanonLaw.info, 27 February 2015Kenneth Doyle, \\"Orans Posture during Our Father\\" in The Boston Pilate, 14 December 2016Bob Sullivan, \\"How should we pray the Our Father?\\" in Southern Nebraska Register, 26 January 2018 In some locations members of the congregation have either adopted the orans posture like the priest or have held each other's hands. The United States bishops conference states: \\"No position is prescribed in the Roman Missal for an assembly gesture during the Lord's Prayer.\\" Some recognized experts on the rubrics of the Roman Rite, the liturgists Edward McNamara and Peter Elliott, deplore the adoption of either of these postures by the congregation as a body,Edward McNamara, \\"Holding Hands at the Our Father? (ZENIT, 18 November 2003)Peter J. Elliott. Liturgical Question Box: Answers to Common Questions about the Modern Liturgy. Ignatius Press; 1 January 1998. . p. 74. and both are subject to controversy.Michael Kerper, \\"Why does everyone do something different at Mass?\\" in Diocese of Manchester: The Catholic Church in New Hampshire Hand-holding in an African-American parish in Oklahoma City before the COVID-19 pandemic The Rite of Peace, the pax, is the second preparatory rite for reception of Holy Communion. After praying: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: Peace I leave you, my peace I give you;John 14:27 look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign for ever and ever,\\" the priest wishes the faithful the peace of Christ: \\"The peace of the Lord be with you always.\\" The deacon or, in his absence, the priest may then invite those present to offer each other the sign of peace. The form of the sign of peace varies according to local custom for a respectful greeting (for instance, a handshake or a bow between strangers, or a kiss/hug between family members). The third preparatory rite is that of fraction and commingling. The priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of . Meanwhile, the \\"Lamb of God\\" (\\"Agnus Dei\\" in Latin) is sung or recited.GIRM, paragraph 83 If extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion are required, they may come forward at this time, and approach the altar itself after the priest has received Communion.GIRM, paragraph 162 The priest then presents the Eucharistic Bread to the congregation, saying: \\"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\\"[Rev 19:9] Then all repeat: \\"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed,\\"Mat 8:8 which is a reference in the Gospel of Matthew to where a Roman centurion manifests exemplary faith in Jesus to heal his servant, saying that Jesus' word alone was sufficient. The priest then receives Communion and, with the help of the deacon and concelebrants and, if necessary, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, distributes Communion to the faithful.GIRM, paragraph 160 According to the Catholic Church doctrine receiving the Holy Communion in a state of mortal sin is a sacrilegeLesson 28 from the Baltimore Cathechism #368 and only those who are in a state of grace, that is, without any mortal sin, can receive it. Based on it affirms the following: \\"Anyone who is aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to confession.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 916 The faithful receive Communion kneeling or standing, as decided by the Episcopal Conference.[Fideles communicant genuflexi vel stantes, prout Conferentia Episcoporum statuerit (Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani, 160 For instance, the United States Episcopal Conference has decreed that \\"Holy Communion is to be received standing, though individual members of the faithful may choose to receive Communion while kneeling\\",General Instruction of the Roman Missal with adaptations for the United States while that for England and Wales says: \\"In the dioceses of England and Wales Holy Communion is to be received standing, though individual members of the faithful may choose to receive Communion while kneeling. However, when they communicate standing, it is recommended that the faithful bow in reverence before receiving the Sacrament.with adaptations for England and Wales The distributing minister says \\"The body of Christ\\" or \\"The blood of Christ\\",Mat 26:26-28 or \\"The body and blood of Christ\\" if both are distributed together (by intinction).GIRM, paragraph 287 The communicant responds: \\"Amen.\\" In most countries the communicant may receive the consecrated Host either on the tongue or in the hand, at the communicant's own discretion. If in the hand they should step aside and reverently consume the Host immediately.Jn 6:50-56 While Communion is distributed, singing of an appropriate approved chant or hymn is recommended, to emphasize the essentially \\"communitarian\\" nature of the body of Christ.GIRM, paragraph 86 If there is no singing, a short antiphon may be recited either by the congregation or by some of them or by a lector. Otherwise, the priest himself recites it just before distributing Communion.GIRM, paragraph 87 \\"The sacred vessels are purified by the priest, the deacon, or an instituted acolyte after Communion or after Mass, insofar as possible at the credence table.\\"GIRM, paragraph 279 Then the priest concludes the Liturgy of the Eucharist with the Prayer after Communion, for which the faithful are invited to stand. =Concluding rite= After the Prayer after Communion, announcements may be made. The Missal says these should be brief. The priest then gives the usual liturgical greeting and imparts his blessing. The liturgy concludes with a dialogue between the priest and the assembly. The deacon, or in his absence, the priest himself then dismisses the faithful. The 2011 edition of the Missal adds new versions of the dismissal.\\"Holy Mass...concludes with the sending forth (missio) of the faithful, so that they may fulfill God‚Äôs will in their daily lives.\\" - Catechism of the Catholic Church ¬ß1332 The faithful respond: \\"Thanks be to God.\\" The priest and other ministers then venerate the altar with a kiss, form a procession, and exit the sanctuary, preferably to a recessional hymn or chant from the Graduale, sung by all. The Mass being over, the faithful may depart or stay a while, pray, light votive candles at shrines in the church, converse with one another, etc. In some countries, including the United States, the priest customarily stands outside the church door to greet the faithful individually as they exit. Time of celebration of Mass Rockhurst U., USA Except during the Paschal Triduum no limits are laid down for the time of celebrating Mass. The traditional rule included in the 1917 Code of Canon Law, forbidding (except to a limited extent on Christmas Night) celebration earlier than one hour before dawn or later than one hour after midday,1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 821 was relaxed in the liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII and completely abolished in those of the Second Vatican Council. Since the Second Vatican Council, the time for fulfilling the obligation to attend Mass on Sunday or a Holy Day of Obligation now begins on the evening of the day before,Letter De Missa vespere sabbati of the Congregation of Rites dated Sept 25 1965, in Enchiridion Documentorum Instaurationis Liturgicae, vol I, n. 35 and most parish churches do celebrate the Sunday Mass also on Saturday evening. By long tradition and liturgical law, Mass is not celebrated at any time on Good Friday, but rather the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord (with hosts consecrated at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday). Nor may Mass on Holy Saturday be celebrated before the Easter Vigil (the beginning of the celebration of Easter Sunday, which is customarily begun only after sunset, completing the Easter Triduum which began on Thursday). Priests are required to celebrate Mass frequently and are earnestly recommended to do so daily. However, \\"apart from those cases in which the law allows him to celebrate or concelebrate the Eucharist a number of times on the same day, a priest may not celebrate more than once a day,\\" and \\"a priest may not celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice without the participation of at least one of the faithful, unless there is a good and reasonable cause for doing so.\\" Priests are required by their posts to celebrate Mass at least on Sundays, for the faithful in their pastoral care. The bishop of a diocese and the pastor of a parish are required to celebrate or arrange for another priest to celebrate on every Sunday or Holy Day of Obligation, a Mass \\"pro populo\\" ‚Äì that is, for the faithful entrusted to his care. For Latin Rite priests, there are a few general exceptions to the limitation to celebrate only one Mass a day.GIRM, paragraph 204 By tradition, they may celebrate Mass three times on Christmas Day (the Midnight Mass or \\"Mass of the Angels\\", the Dawn Mass or \\"Shepherd's Mass\\", and the Day Mass or \\"Mass of the Divine Word\\", each of which has its own readings and chants). On All Souls' Day they may also, on the basis of a privilege to all priests by Pope Benedict XV in August 1915, celebrate Mass three times; only one of the three Masses may be for the personal intentions of the priest, while the other two Masses must be for all the faithful departed and for the intentions of the Pope. A priest who has concelebrated the Chrism Mass, which may be held on the morning of Holy Thursday, may also celebrate or concelebrate the Mass of the Lord's Supper that evening. A priest may celebrate or concelebrate both the Mass of the Easter Vigil and Mass of Easter Sunday (the Easter Vigil \\"should not begin before nightfall; it should end before daybreak on Sunday\\"; and may therefore take place at midnight or in the early hours of Easter morning). Finally, a priest who has concelebrated Mass at a meeting of priests or during a pastoral visitation by a bishop or a bishop's delegate, may celebrate a second Mass for the benefit of the laity. In addition to these general permissions, the Local Ordinary may, for a good reason, permit priests to celebrate twice (they are then said to \\"binate\\") on weekdays, and three times (\\"trinate\\" or \\"trination\\") on Sundays and Holy Days (canon 905 ¬ß2). Examples would be if a parish priest were to need to celebrate the usual, scheduled daily Mass of a parish and a funeral later in the morning, or three Masses to accommodate all of the parishioners in a very populous parish on Sundays. In particularly difficult circumstances, the Pope can grant the diocesan bishop permission to give his priests faculties to trinate on weekdays and quadrinate on Sundays. In many countries, the bishop's power to permit priests to celebrate two or three Masses on one day is widely used, and it is common for priests assigned to parish ministry to celebrate at least two Masses on any given Sunday, and two Masses on several other days of the week. Permission for four Masses on one day has been obtained in order to cope with large numbers of Catholics either in mission lands or where the ranks of priests are diminishing. This sometimes also happens in the case of historic churches which are unusually small compared to their number of parishioners, but which have not been replaced due to their historic character. A Catholic beach Mass held in Long Beach, New York. =Summary table regarding priests with pastoral responsibilities= { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" width=40% - bgcolor=#f9f9f9 ! width=\\"70%\\"  Situation ! width=\\"5%\\"  Masses permitted ! width=\\"5%\\"  Masses required* - valign=\\"top\\"  Normal weekday  1  0 - valign=\\"top\\"  Normal Sunday  1  1 - valign=\\"top\\"  Sunday, for just reasons**  2  1 - valign=\\"top\\"  All Souls' Day  3  1 - valign=\\"top\\"  Christmas Day***  3  1 - valign=\\"top\\"  Weekday with permission of Local Ordinary  2  0 - valign=\\"top\\"  Sunday or Holy Day with permission of Local Ordinary  3  1 - valign=\\"top\\"  Weekday with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary  3  0 - valign=\\"top\\" Sunday or Holy Day with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary  4  1 } * By any priest of a parish for the people; that is to say, individual priests are not required to say Masses on these days per se, but a Mass in each parish or oratory must be available for the people. ** According to the pastor's own judgment. *** By longstanding custom, this includes the First Mass of Christmas \\"during the night\\", even if it begins somewhat earlier than midnight. Duration of the celebration The length of time that it takes to celebrate Mass varies considerably. While the Roman Rite liturgy is shorter than other liturgical rites, it may on solemn occasions ‚Äì even apart from exceptional circumstances such as the Easter Vigil or an event such as ordinations ‚Äì take over an hour and a half. The length of the homily is an obvious factor that contributes to the overall length. (On Wednesday 7 March 2018, during his weekly general audience in the Vatican's Paul VI Hall, continuing his catechesis on the liturgy, Pope Francis advised the clergy that homilies ought to last ‚Äúno more than 10 minutes‚Äù). Other factors are the number of people receiving Communion and the number and length of the chants and other singing. For most of the second millennium, before the twentieth century brought changes beginning with Pope Pius X's encouragement of frequent Communion, the usual Mass was said exactly the same way whether people other than a server were present or not. No homily was given,Preaching was generally done outside Mass. The Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae of the Tridentine Missal mentions preaching at Mass only in connection with Solemn Mass (in section VI, 60) and only as a possibility. and most often only the priest himself received Communion. Moral theologians gave their opinions on how much time the priest should dedicate to celebrating a Mass, a matter on which canon law and the Roman Missal were silent. One said that an hour should not be considered too long. Several others that, in order to avoid tedium, Mass should last no more than half an hour; and in order to be said with due reverence, it should last no less than twenty minutes. Another theologian, who gave half an hour as the minimum time, considered that Mass could not be said in less than a quarter of an hour, an opinion supported by others, including Saint Alphonsus Liguori who said that any priest who finished Mass in less than that time could scarcely be excused from mortal sin. Ritual Masses A Mass celebrated in connection with a particular rite, such as an ordination, a wedding, or a profession of religious vows, may use texts provided in the \\"Ritual Masses\\" section of the Roman Missal. The rite in question is, most often, a sacrament, but the section has special texts not only for Masses within which Baptism, Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy orders, and Matrimony are celebrated, but also for Masses with religious profession, the dedication of a church, and several other rites.Penance is the only sacrament not celebrated within a Eucharistic framework and for which therefore no Ritual Mass is provided. The Ritual Mass texts may not be used, except perhaps partially, when the rite is celebrated during especially important liturgical seasons or on high ranking feasts. A Nuptial Mass is a Ritual Mass within which the sacrament of matrimony is celebrated. If one of a couple being married in a Catholic church is not a Catholic, the rite of matrimony outside Mass is to be followed. However, if the non-Catholic has been validly baptized, then, in exceptional cases and provided the bishop of the diocese gives permission, it may be considered suitable to celebrate the marriage within Mass, except that, according to the general law, Communion is not given to the non-Catholic (Rite of Marriage, 8). The Nuptial Mass contains special prayers for the couple and, in the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, may be offered at any time of the liturgical year, except during the Paschal Triduum. Other Masses In the United States, the term \\"Red Mass\\" used traditionally of a Eucharistic celebration for members of the legal profession has more recently given rise to annual \\"Blue Masses\\" for police officers and others engaged in public safety, as well as \\"White\\" or \\"Rose\\" Masses for doctors, nurses, and other health-care professionals.St. Anthony Messenger, monthly Catholic magazine, January 2008, p. 46. =Red Mass= A \\"Red Mass\\" is a Mass celebrated annually in the Catholic Church for judges, lawyers, law school professors, law students, and government officials. The Mass requests guidance from the Holy Spirit for all who apply justice, and offers the opportunity to reflect on what Catholics believe is the God-given power and responsibility of all in the legal profession. =Blue Mass= A \\"Blue Mass\\" is a Mass celebrated annually in the Catholic Church for those employed in the \\"public safety field\\" (i.e., police officers, firefighters, correctional officers, 911 operators and EMS personnel). The color blue relates to the blue-colored uniforms predominantly used by these services. The service honors those who have died in the line of duty and those currently serving as first responders. The Mass is an opportunity for the community to show gratitude to first responders and their families. =White Mass= The tradition of the White Mass in the United States finds its origins in the development of the national Catholic Medical Association in the early 1930s. The White Mass, so named by the color worn by those in the healing profession of medicine, is held in recognition of the dedicated work of healthcare professionals and to ask God's blessing upon patient, doctor, nurse, and caregiver. The Archdiocese of St. Louis celebrates a 'White Mass' every year for those involved in healthcare. The Mass is associated with St. Luke, the patron of physicians and surgeons, whose feast day is October 18. The Archdiocese of Atlanta also celebrates a White Mass honoring health care professionals, as does Creighton University. St. Patrick's Cathedral in Norwich, Connecticut, held its twenty-fifth White Mass in 2015. The speaker at the brunch following the Mass was Lt. Commander Seth Flagg M.D. of the U.S. Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment. In Lewiston, Maine, the White Mass is held in February to coincide with the World Day of Prayer for the Sick, instituted by Pope John Paul II in 1992 as \\"a special time of prayer and sharing, ...and of reminding everyone to see in his sick brother or sister the face of Christ\\". It is celebrated on February 11, the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. =Rose Mass= Since 1992 the John Carroll Society has sponsored a Rose Mass in the Archdiocese of Washington, to acknowledge medical, dental, nursing, and allied workers and volunteers and the many health care institutions in the Archdiocese of Washington. It takes place annually on the fourth Sunday of Lent (‚ÄúLaetare Sunday‚Äù), a Sunday when the vestments worn by the celebrant may be rose-colored. The color rose was chosen as the rose has come to symbolize ‚Äúlife,‚Äù The Lansing Guild of the Catholic Medical Association hosts a Rose Mass in Ann Arbor, Michigan. =Gold Mass= The first \\"Gold Mass\\" ‚Äì for scientists ‚Äì was scheduled to be held on November 15, 2016, in the chapel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The sponsor is the Society of Catholic Scientists,See: Society of Catholic Scientists website. which was incorporated in the summer of 2016 in the territory of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The color gold was chosen because (1) it represents the alchemy of science and (2) it is the color that is worn ‚Äì at graduation ceremonies ‚Äì on the hood of those who are being awarded bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degrees in the academic discipline of science. The date of November 15 was chosen because it is the feast day of St. Albert the Great, a Dominican doctor of the Church who is the patron of scientists.

It is a poorly known group as a whole, though most are believed to be parasitoids (especially of flies), and a few hyperparasitoids. Many are found in the soil, and of these, a number are wingless. The family is distinguished from the closely related Megaspilidae by having a very small stigma in the wing, a very broad metasomal petiole, and a single median groove in the mesoscutum.

Life and education Odhiambo was educated at Maseno School in Kenya, Makerere University in Uganda and Queens' College, Cambridge in United Kingdom. He founded the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) and helped to establish three institutions of learning: the Third World Academy of Sciences, the Kenyan National Academy of Sciences and the African Academy of Sciences. He inspired different Kenyan scholars and leaders, notably, academician Odhiambo Siangla and politician Kalonzo Musyoka. He encouraged the younger generation of thinkers to venture into the fine arts, investigate its relation to history of life sciences and to go out and create global academies and research institutions using technology. His inspiring effect led to the re‚Äìemergence of accumulated indigenous knowledge and technology systems in the modern African world. He led visions on agricultural development in Africa by initiating effective scientific projects leading to advancement in growing indigenous crops and disseminating methods of insect control. Educated in Cambridge University, UK, Prof. Odhiambo completed a PhD in 1965 under the supervision of the guru of insect physiology, Vincent Wigglesworth, producing a ‚Äòphenomenally productive‚Äô thesis on the reproductive physiology of the desert locust, producing a series of 14 papers on the topic. He marked his arrival into the world of insect science through a sole-authored short communication in Nature journal titled, Metabolic effects of corpus allatum hormone, in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Founder of icipe (International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology) Upon his return to Kenya, Prof. Odhiambo, took up a position as a lecturer in the Department of Zoology at the University of Nairobi. In 1967, he was approached by the Science journal to write a review on the status of science in Africa.DOI: 10.1126/science.158.3803.876 In the article, Prof. Odhiambo observed that scientific research was urgently required in the then postcolonial Africa, to develop environmentally safe strategies to increase agricultural production, and to address prevalent tropical and vector borne diseases. He stressed that the science conducted in Africa should have at its heart the elevation of the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. At the same time, Prof. Odhiambo noted, the indigenous scientific community in Africa was ‚Äòwoefully small‚Äô, and the continent was hardly equipped, from a financial and infrastructural point of view, to effectively tackle the challenges at hand. He, therefore, proposed that Africa's best long term solution towards conducting effective research was to concentrate efforts in a few centres of excellence. Giving the example that eventually led to the establishment of icipe, Prof. Odhiambo recommended that Africa's insect research could be located in one centre that would have the best equipment, which would be put to the best advantage. Such a centre would have a permanent staff; it would also train young researchers from Africa and offer opportunities to other scientists from across the globe looking for ‚Äòperiodical renovation‚Äô. In Prof Odhiambo's words, the insect science centre of excellence would become ‚Äòa powerhouse for the initiated and those wishing to be initiated into research‚Äô. Prof. Odhiambo's ideas got support from, among others, Carl Djerassi, a world-renowned American scientist. Together, Odhiambo and Djerassi set the wheels in motion for the launching of icipe. Eventually, they gained the support of 21 national academies of science across the globe, who became sponsors of icipe, providing the needed external research directors. icipe was declared open for business in 1970, one of its objectives being the creation of motivated and highly talented ‚Äòhuman capital‚Äô in insect research and related areas of science, to enable Africa to sustain herself and to lead the entire pan-tropical world in this area of endeavour. Prof. Odhiambo later remarked: ‚ÄúThe idea was actually very simple, get the very best people and then if you have more money, put buildings and equipment around them.‚Äù In the beginning money was in short supply at icipe, and the Centre's headquarters consisted of a number of rented wood-frame barracks perched on the hillside of Chiromo Campus at the University of Nairobi. The first postdoctoral researcher arrived to work in a garage that flooded when it rained and the budget was improvised from week to week. Today, icipe stands as a centre of scientific excellence and training in Africa. And as Prof. Odhiambo had hoped, it is indeed staffed mainly by indigenous African scientists. icipe currently has a staff of more than 400, and the Centre collaborates with over 200 national systems, research institutes and universities around the world. Prof. Odhiambo's vision of holistic science is today embodied in the Centre's 4Hs paradigm, denoting human, animal, plant and environmental health. Its major research areas include disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and tsetse, as well as pests of cereals and horticultural crops. icipe scientists are also conducting research into beneficial insects such as bees and silkworm moths.

At the village of Bovan, the river is dammed, as part of the complex project of the Velika Morava river regulation. Artificial Bovan lake flooded the Bovan gorge carved by the river and is very popular local and regional tourist destination, especially among campers and fishermen, but the coastline is not put in order. The river continues to the south, in an inverse flow, and after the villages of Subotinac and Kraljevo, it empties into the Ju≈æna Morava at the town of Aleksinac.

The song was credited to Darin and \\"Jean Murray\\" (a combination of their names) to avoid any hint of payola. It was Darin's first hit and the song helped to give him a major boost in his career, reaching No. 3 on the U.S. pop singles chart and No. 2 on the R&B; Best Sellers chart. \\"Splish Splash\\" was Darin's only entry on the C&W; Best Sellers in Stores chart, where it peaked at No. 14. In a 1967 interview, Darin claimed that he was so happy about having his first hit that his skin condition cleared up. Production Splish Splash was recorded in a session at New York's Atlantic Studios on the evening of April 10, 1958. The personnel on the original recording included Jesse Powell on tenor sax,Biography of Jesse Powell. Allmusic. Al Caiola, Billy Mure on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Panama Francis on drums. The lyrics mention several characters from other songs of the period, including \\"Lollipop\\", \\"Peggy Sue\\", and \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\". However, in an interview, former classmate Jerrold Atlas claimed that \\"Miss Molly\\" referred to Molly Epstein, Darin's former English teacher at the Bronx High School of Science. \\"She taught him to use the language in staccato notes: short fast, words...She was very fond of Bobby. Bobby told me she sharpened his respect for language\\".David Evanier. \\"Chapter 3: The Nerve of a Burglar\\" Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (Holtzbrinck Publishers, 2004) pages 18-19. Other versions British comedian Charlie Drake scored a top ten hit with a comedy version of the song in 1958, produced by future Beatles producer George Martin on the Parlophone label. The song was remade in 1979 by Barbra Streisand for her album Wet. It features new lyrics by Streisand and backing vocals from Toto lead singer Bobby Kimball and Chicago keyboardist Bill Champlin. A Brazilian Portuguese version of the song was recorded in 1963 by Roberto Carlos. On 1965, Quebecois group C√©sar et les Romains broadcast a French cover of the song on television, over the network T√©l√©-M√©tropole. In 1976, Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond performed the song on The Brady Bunch Variety Hour. Sky diver Andre Tayir performs this song on the Kidsongs Kids‚Äô 1990 video: Ride the Roller Coaster. In 1990, Joanie Bartels covered the song, releasing it as a single from the album Bathtime Magic, the compilation album The Stars of Discovery Music and from the 1994 video The Rainy Day Adventure. Kevin Spacey performs the song in the Bobby Darin biopic Beyond the Sea (2004). In both the English and German versions of Animals United (2010), Billy the Meerkat sings this song while taking a shower, but it's cut off by Toto the Chimpanzee. In popular culture \\"Splish Splash\\" was featured in the trailer for the Patrick Dempsey film Loverboy. It also appears in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie You've Got Mail. The song appeared in an episode of Happy Days, in which where Richie Cunningham becomes a DJ, 'Richie the C' (possibly a play on Murray the K). In the Family Ties episode \\"The Boys Next Door\\", Elyse performs the song with her childhood friend Roger at a class reunion. It was featured in a DTV music video on The Disney Channel, set mostly to clips of Disney characters bathing, particularly from the 1948 cartoon Mickey and the Seal (illustrating the singer's bath in the first verse), as well as Mickey's Birthday Party (to illustrate the party Darin walks in on). The song was also featured on an insert on Sesame Street, where the Zoo keepers at the Bronx Zoo are washing the elephants. The song can also be heard in the films Because of Winn-Dixie and Air Bud. It was partially sung in 2012 film The Dictator, when the main character, General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays a practical joke on his new friend (Jason Mantzoukas) by singing the song with a severed head as a hand puppet, while his friend is taking a shower.

He served as Governor of Rome and then papal Vicar of Rome. He was personally esteemed both by the Emperor Charles V and by Pope Paul III. He was Bishop of Borgo San Sepolcro (1539‚Äì1546), Bishop of Saluzzo (1546‚Äì1556), and Archbishop of Milan (1556‚Äì1558). Biography Archinto was born on 3 July 1495.Giussano, p. 6. Savio, p. 206. Alberigo gives the date 1500, counting backwards twenty years apparently from 1519 or 1520, when Filippo first appears as one of the Dodici di provvisione di Milano and shortly thereafter the Collegio dei giuristi . He was the second son of Cristoforo Archinto, whose ancestor Manfredo had helped found the monastery of Chiaravalle near Milan in 1135, and Maddalena Torriani. His brothers were Giovanni Battista, who was a soldier and an ambassador of the Emperor Charles V, and Alessandro, who became a regional quaestor in the city of Milan.Giussano, pp. 2-6. Filippo was sent by his father to study at Pavia, but at the age of 20 he was summoned back to Milan to be at his father's deathbed. He returned to Pavia, and then spent some time studying at Bologna, though he returned to Pavia to take his degree.Giussano, pp. 11-14. He obtained a doctorate in law. He returned to Milan and was admitted to the College of Legists.The Catholic Encyclopedia is wrong, both as to the university and the age at which he took his degree, claiming that Filippo was twenty when he got his degree at Padua, due to a hasty reading of Giussano. =Diplomat= In 1529, he was a member of an embassy sent by the city of Milan to the Emperor Charles V at Barcelona, to advise the Emperor of the loyalty of the Milanese and to inform him of their needs. He then attended the Coronation of the Emperor in Bologna as a representative of Milan.Giussano, pp. 41-44. Savio, p. 209. In 1535, on the death of Francesco II, the last of the Sforza dukes of Milan, Archinto was chosen by the city for an embassy to inform the Emperor Charles V, and to negotiate the future of Milan as part of the Emperor's domains.He was congratulated by the city for completing his mission successfully. Saxius, p. 1009. The Milanese embassy met the Emperor in Naples, where Charles was celebrating the marriage of his daughter Marguerite to Alessandro de'Medici.Giussano, pp. 32-37. Charles V was sufficiently impressed with Filippo that he named him an imperial councillor. He also appointed Archinto to an embassy to Pope Paul III, to negotiate the succession to the Marquisate of Monferrato.Giussano, pp. 62-66. Savio, p. 211. =Papal official= Archinto revealed such talents for diplomacy that Pope Paul III named him a Protonotary Apostolic partecipante.Giussano, p. 73. Savio, p. 212. On 6 May 1538, Archinto was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church and Governor of the city of Rome.He was succeeded on 12 July 1541 by Michele Franzino. Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario storico-ecclesiastica, Vol. XXXII (Venezia: Tipografia Emiliana 1845), pp. 41-42. Among others, he was granted, as abbot commendatory, the benefices of the abbey of S. Giovanni Battista di Vertemate (diocese of Como) and the abbey of S. Bartolomeo in Pavia.Savio, p. 213. When Paul III set off for Nice to meet Charles V and Francis I of France in an effort to arrange a peace, he took Archinto with him, with the title of Governor of the Court. The journey began on 23 March 1538. A truce was signed on 18 June. When the last legitimate duke of Camerino died, Pope Paul, intending to reclaim the duchy for the church, sent Archinto as Governor of the city of Camerino to negotiate with the pretender, Mattia de Varano. He spent six months reforming the city, but he was back in Rome in 1539, and preached the funeral oration for the Empress Isabella, wife of Charles V, who had died on 1 May 1539.Savio, p. 214-215. On 26 February 1539, he was appointed to the Congregation for the Fabric of S. Peter's.The congregation was a committee of prelates, headed by the Cardinal Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica, who administered the physical plant of S. Peter's Basilica. =Bishop= On 19 March 1539, Pope Paul named Archinto Bishop of Borgo San Sepolcro (1539‚Äì1546).Eubel and Gulik, p. 143. This did not mean that Bishop Archinto would be spending his time in a small diocese in southeastern Tuscany. On 3 November 1542, by the bull \\"Licet ecclesiarum omnium\\", the Pope named him his Vicar for the city of Rome.Savio, pp. 215-216. Savio says that the appointment came because of the death of Cardinal Bartolomeo Guidiccione, who, however, did not die until 4 November 1549, according to Eubel, p. 27, no. 34. Pope Paul III also sent the Bishop of Borgo San Sepolcro to the Council of Trent, whose meetings had been transferred to Bologna.Archinto, Bishop of Saluzzo, was present at the opening of the Council in Bologna: J.-D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXXV (Paris 1902), p. 397. He was appointed to a \\"Commission of vigilance,\\" whose purpose was to collect public and private information about the doings of the council and of its members. When the council was suspended, Archinto returned to Rome.Savio, p. 213. On 19 October 1546, by the bull \\"Cum sicut accepimus\\", he was transferred to the diocese of Saluzzo,Savio, p. 217. Eubel and Gulik, p. 290, with note 6. though he was still serving as papal Vicar of the city of Rome. Savio provides evidence to indicate that the bishop visited the diocese, and held a diocesan synod in 1546 and a pastoral visitation in the next year. He had a Vicar General, however, Silvestro Tapparelli, who was a protonotary apostolic, who administered the diocese when Archinto was in Rome.Savio, p. 223. As the new bishop, Archinto sought to acquire for the episcopal income the properties which had been designated by Pope Julius II when he created the diocese of Saluzzo. This particularly involved the Cistercian monastery of S. Antonio, which had long resisted complying with Pope Julius' bull. The bishop used his influence as the second ranking official in the Apostolic Camera to obtain a decree on 3 November 1546, which ordered the monks to vacate the monastery and turn the properties over to the bishop; the monks appealed to Pope Julius III, but lost their suit. They continued to resist, and remained in occupation, despite being excommunicated, throughout Archinto's episcopacy.Savio, pp. 216-219. In 1551, he instituted proceedings before the Auditor of the Apostolic Camera against the collegiate church of Carmagnola, which, when the church belonged to the diocese of Turin, owed the bishop of Turin an annual pension of 20 ducats. Naturally the Chapter appealed, and the suit dragged on long after Archinto's term.Savio, pp. 219-221. In 1548, the marquesate of Saluzzo, under French occupation, surrendered to Henry II and was annexed by France. St. Ignatius Loyola found in him a powerful protector in the early years of the Society of Jesus.Saxius, p. 1011. In 1548, as Vicar of the city, he was a member of the commission that reviewed Ignatius' book, Spiritual Exercises.Savio, p. 225. From 1554 to 1556, Archinto served as papal Nuncio with the authority of a Legatus a latere to the Serene Republic of Venice.Giussano, pp. 157-161. Archinto was appointed Archbishop of Milan, on the recommendation of King Philip II,Saxius, p. 1009. by Pope Paul IV on 16 December 1556. Pope Paul and the Spanish were on bad terms, however, and the Spanish governor of Milan, Juan de Fonseca, refused to admit the new archbishop to the city, alleging that he had no instructions from the King on the subject of Archinto, and needed to send to Spain for new orders. Archinto therefore withdrew to Bergamo, whose bishop, Victor Superantius, had been deposed for heresy. As the Metropolitan, he assumed administratorship of that church.Eubel and Gulik, p. 132 with notes 8 and 9. He had earlier been suspended in June 1552 and Bergamo was provided with an apostolic administrator; he was restored in May 1554, but assigned a coadjutor bishop. The Pope granted him the use of the pallium (a symbolic decorative scarf) on 20 September 1577. The King finally replied to Fonseca with definitive orders on 15 January 1558, and on 8 February Fonseca wrote to Archinto, promising him a splendid possessio ceremony, in which he himself would take part.Giussano, pp. 167-171. His death at Bergamo of a lenta febre on 21 June 1558 prevented his installation in the archiepiscopal chair of Milan.Giussano, p. 182. Eubel and Gulik, p. 240 with note 8. His published works include De fide et sacramentis edictum (Rome 1545; Cracow, 1545; Ingolstadt 1546; Turin, 1549), issued in his capacity as Vicar of the city of Rome;Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario storico-ecclesiastica, Vol. XCIX (Venezia: Tipografia Emiliana 1860), pp. 93-94. and Oratio de nova christiani orbis pace habita (Rome, 1544), a speech given in the presence of Pope Paul III, lauding his efforts to bring peace between Francis I of France and the Emperor Charles V.

Sansa had asked Nakamura D≈çseki to act as San'etsu's guardian, and through D≈çseki's good offices an annual 30 koku of rice was negotiated.Go Monthly Review 1963/5 p.53 During his minority the position of head of the Hon'inb≈ç house was in abeyance, so that the house notionally did not exist. He played in an international match, giving Peichin Tsuhanoko of the Ryukyu Kingdom a two-stone handicap, when the latter came to Japan with a Ryukyuan embassy in 1634.http://www.gogod.demon.co.uk/NewInGo/Firsts_intl.htm The high point of San'etsu's professional career came in a challenge match against Yasui Sanchi. From 1645 to 1653 they played six games of oshirogo, but the result was 3-3. Neither player therefore made the step up from 8 dan to Meijin.

The reunited Dokken recorded the album before a live audience at The Strand, an intimate concert venue in Redondo Beach, California, on December 13, 1994 and prior to their 1995 tour. The album went virtually unheard at the time of its release. Released at the time when grunge and alternative rock were dominating mainstream rock music, MTV had no interest in featuring glam metal acts; so Dokken decided to do their own \\"unplugged\\" album.

Its departments and programs are: Editorial Services, Geologic Hazards Program, Energy & Minerals Program, Geologic Information and Outreach Program, Geologic Mapping Program, Ground Water and Paleontology Program, and the State Energy Program. The UGS has worked on countless projects in the state, including statewide Geologic hazards maps, oil shale assessment, Great Salt Lake studies, fault trenching, and the Snake Valley/West Desert Groundwater Monitoring Well Project. In addition, recent research and general geologic information is given in teacher-friendly formats for anyone to use. History The \\"University Geological and Resource Survey of Utah\\" was founded in 1919, but without funding. In 1931 the \\"Utah Geological and Mineralogical Survey\\" was created by the Utah State Legislature. The state governor appointed an advisory board, but no funding was appropriated for salaries or operations and no personnel were assigned to the Survey. In 1941 the UGMS was placed in the newly created ‚ÄúUtah State Department of Publicity and Industrial Development‚Äù (UPID). The UPID hired geologist A.M. Buranek. Over the next few years, Buranek and other contract personnel publish 36 geologic publications sponsored by the UPID. During 1946 the governor appointed Arthur L. Crawford as commissioner of the UPID and urged Crawford to activate the UGMS. Crawford re-hired Buranek and added other geologists, but work continued under the auspices of the UPID. UPID was disbanded by the state in 1949 and the UGMS was transferred to the State School of Mines and Mineral Industries at the University of Utah. Crawford was appointed first Director of the UGMS and the Legislature appropriated $25,000 for the 1949‚Äì1951 biennial budget. From 1961 to 1965 the UGMS and University of Utah College of Mines and Mineral Industries jointly published the four-part, 1:250,000-scale geologic map of Utah. The first issue of the quarterly publication Quarterly Review (renamed Survey Notes in 1976), containing information pertaining to Utah's geology and mineral industry, was published in 1964. In 1973 the Legislature transferred the UGMS from the University of Utah to the Utah Department of Natural Resources and officially named the Survey Director as the State Geologist. The Survey's name was also shortened to ‚ÄúUtah Geological and Mineral Survey‚Äù (previously ‚ÄúMineralogical‚Äù).

The \\"Homes of Tomorrow\\" exhibition was one of the most noteworthy exhibits of the Fair, and showcased man's modern innovations in architecture, design, and building materials. In addition to several unique art deco and contemporary designs for a dozen model homes, futuristic home furnishings and accoutrements such as a personal helicopter pad were anticipated. Several architects and firms used the model homes to demonstrate their techniques for the pre-fabricated home and new materials. Baked enamel and Rostone ‚Äî a man-made type of masonry that could be molded into specific shapes and produced in various colors ‚Äî were hailed as affordable and durable home construction options.

Arthur became a member of the Dominican Order in the convent of St. Stephen at Salamanca, Spain, and taught theology in different convents of his order, especially at Salamanca, with great credit to himself and profit to his numerous students. In 1640 he was called to the University of Coimbra as first professor of theology, and held this chair until 1642. On the occasion of the separation of Portugal from Spain, he was expelled for refusing to take the oath to defend the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. He returned to the convent of St. Dominic in Lisbon, where he resided for many years and devoted himself to the preparation of a commentary on the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas. The projected work was to have comprised ten volumes, but the death of the learned writer prevented its completion. Only the first volume was ever printed (1655). The second was completed and never published. The Dominican historiographers Jacques Qu√©tif and Jacques √âchard give February, 1644, as the date of his death, but the consensus is in favour of 1670.

History In the late 1960s the first bus used for communication was developed by Hewlett-Packard and was called HP-IB (Hewlett- Packard Interface Bus). Since HP-IB was originally designed to only work with HP instruments, the need arose for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers from a variety of vendors. This need was addressed in 1975 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488-1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. The standard was updated in 1987 and again in 1992 This bus is known by three different names, General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HP-IB), and IEEE-488 Bus, and is used worldwide. Today, there are several other buses in addition to the GPIB that can be used for instrument control. These include: Ethernet, USB, Serial, PCI, and PXI. Software In addition to the hardware bus to control an instrument, software for the PC is also needed. Virtual Instrument Software Architecture, or VISA, was developed by the VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI) plug and play Systems Alliance as a specification for I/O software. VISA was a step toward industry-wide software compatibility. The VISA specification defines a software standard for VXI, and for GPIB, serial, Ethernet and other interfaces. More than 35 of the largest instrumentation companies in the industry endorse VISA as the standard. The alliance created distinct frameworks by grouping the most popular operating systems, application development environments, and programming languages and defined in-depth specifications to guarantee interoperability of components within each framework. Instruments can be programmed by sending and receiving text based SCPI commands or by using an instrument driver . To ease the programming of instruments, many instruments are provided with industry standard instrument drivers such as VXIplug&play; or IVI. These drivers require a VISA library to be to installed on the PC. IVI instrument drivers were designed to enable interchangeability of instruments in a manufacturing setting where automation and reduced down-time are important, but they are often used in other applications as well. Application development environments can support instrument control by supporting VISA and industry standard instrument drivers. Environments supporting VISA include LabVIEW, LabWindows/CVI, MATLAB, and VEE. Furthermore, the VISA library can support programming languages like C, C++, C#, Python and others.

Etymology \\"Caruru\\" comes from the African term kalalu. Another possibility is that it is a Tupi noun, ca√°-laughu, the eating herb, as defined by C√¢mara Cascudo. It is a curious case of similar words, which generates some confusion between the plant and the dish.FERREIRA, A. B. H. Novo dicion√°rio da l√≠ngua portuguesa. 2¬™ edi√ß√£o. Rio de Janeiro. Nova Fronteira. 1986. p. 361. Origin Guilherme Piso, who lived in Pernambuco (1638-1644), reports the caruru made with medicinal and food herb (and not with okra). In his story in Historia Naturalis Brasiliae, the doctor from Count Maur√≠cio de Nassau informs that \\"this bredo (caruru) is eaten as a vegetable and cooked instead of spinach ...\\". Another account, in 1820, in the Amazon, by Von Martius, mentions the \\"caruru-a√ßu\\" during a meal with the natives near the Madeira River, when he experienced \\"a delicacy of chestnuts pounded with an herb similar to spinach ...\\" . In other words: this description is of a caruru made with the caruru plant, originally from the Americas (and not from Africa, which is the case of okra). For the dish, the cuisine of Dahome Nag√¥, from Yoruba Nigeria, and indigenous from Bahia would have been combined. During his visit to Africa, at the end of the 18th century, Father Vicente Ferreira Pires called the meal in Daom√© \\"chicken caruru\\", revealing that the use of oil palm, a palm of African origin. Originally, the Brazilian caruru was a stew of herbs that served to accompany another dish (meat or fish). The current version of the caruru, however, is more African than indigenous, being made with okra, chili, dried shrimp and palm oil.Viagem pelo Brasil 1817-1820: Excertos e Ilustra√ß√µes.

The rebellion began in 1742 in the Gran Pajonal among the Ash√°ninka people. Spanish Peru. The indigenous people expelled Roman Catholic missionaries and destroyed or forced the evacuation of 23 missions, many of them defended, in the central jungle area of Peru. Several Spanish military expeditions tried to suppress the rebellion but failed or were defeated. In 1752, Santos attempted to expand his rebellion into the Andes and gain the support of the highland people. He captured the town of Andamarca and held it for three days before withdrawing to the jungle. Santos disappeared from the historical record after 1752. Santos, Jesuit-educated with both Christian and millenarian ideas, claimed to be the reincarnation of Atahualpa, the Inca emperor at the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru. His objective seems to have been the expulsion of the Spanish from Peru and the restoration of the Inca Empire. He failed in that ambitious goal, but he and his followers succeeded in expelling Catholic missionaries and preventing Spanish and Peruvian settlement in a large area of the Peruvian yungas (high jungle or monta√±a) for more than one hundred years. \\"Santos's rebellion had given the Indigenous people of the jungle a previously unknown unity and had awakened in them an ancient taste for freedom and independence.\\" Early life Little that can be said with certainty about the early life of Juan Santos. He was an indigenous person (possibly a mixed-blood mestizo), born about 1710, probably in Cuzco, although several other birthplaces have been proposed. He had three brothers. He was educated by the Jesuits in Cuzco. He said that he had visited Europe and Angola, presumably as a servant to the Jesuits. Quechua was his native language and he also spoke Spanish, Latin, and Ash√©ninka. Santos apparently had contemplated revolution for a long time. He was said by the Spanish to have traveled widely in Peru as a young man to preach his message and sow the seeds of rebellion. Those travels apparently included the Gran Pajonal where Santos learned to speak Ash√©ninka. The Franciscans later claimed that he fled Cuzco for the Amazon jungles as a fugitive because he murdered his master, a Jesuit priest, although no contemporary evidence backs up that story. The name Atahualpa comes from the Inca ruler Atahualpa, ruler of the Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu) at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Santos appropriated the names Atahualpa and Huayna Capac as he claimed to be the reincarnation of the former Incan emperors. The indigenous people The Ash√°ninka people were the most populous of the indigenous people of the Peruvian Amazon, occupying a territory of about from 10 to 14 degrees south latitude in the foothills of the Andes and in the lowlands of the Amazon Basin. They numbered about 52,000. Not all the widely dispersed Ash√°ninka and other groups participated in the rebellion. Juan Santos' rebellion began on the Gran Pajonal (Great Grassland), an elevated plateau, and his area of influence extended into the regions of the Cerro de la Sal (Mountain of Salt); and the Chanchamayo. Other indigenous groups supporting the rebellion were the Amuesha and Nomatsiguenga peoples. Downloaded from Project Muse. The missions The area of the rebellion was the nearest and most accessible part of the Amazon Basin with its navigable rivers to Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, and thus the happenings there were of special interest and concern to the Spanish. Missionary activities by the Franciscans began in 1635. From the beginning there was opposition from the Ash√°ninka and others. The Ash√°ninka killed several priests and missions were often abandoned due to the hostility of the local people. A determined and extensive attempt to make Christians of the indigenous people began in 1709 as many missions were founded. Franciscan efforts reached the isolated Gran Pajonal in 1733. In 1736, the missionaries reported that they had established 24 mission stations with 4,835 inhabitants. The Franciscans maintained discipline in their missions with armed men, often African slaves. Several of the missions had military garrisons armed with muskets and cannons. The Franciscans also encouraged settlement by imported farmers and artisans who used indigenous slave labor in their work places.. Downloaded from JSTOR. The indigenous people were attracted to the missions for three reasons. First may have been interest in the Christian religion. Secondly, the missionaries distributed steel tools such as axes and shovels which made the life of a slash-and-burn Ash√°ninka farmer easier and which also made it possible for steel tools to be turned into weapons which gave the possessor an advantage over his enemies in war. Thirdly, the indigenous people needed salt as a seasoning and to preserve food and the missionaries attempted to control access to the salt vein at the Cerro de la Sal. Balancing these incentives were the undesirable features of life at the missions. The missionaries attempted to make the semi-nomadic indigenous people sedentary and to regiment strictly their lives. This created problems with food production as jungle soils were infertile and easily exhausted and a sedentary people had difficulty producing sufficient food. However, the most serious problem of the reductions, as the Spanish called the policy of encouraging or forcing indigenous people to live in permanent settlements, was the pandemics of European diseases which ravaged the populations of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas, especially those living in close proximity to each other in settlements. For example, an epidemic at the mission of Eneno in 1722-1723 resulted in a decrease in population at the mission from 800 to 220 as most of the inhabitants died of the disease or fled the settlement. Rebellions against the Franciscans and the missions were frequent. The most recent of the revolts before the rise of Juan Santos was in 1737. An Ash√°ninka headman named Ignacio Torote destroyed two missions killing 13 people, including five priests. A survivor reported that Torote gave his reasons to a priest for the rebellion, \\"you and yours are killing us every day with your sermons and doctrines, taking our freedom away.\\" Torote's twenty followers were captured and executed by the Spanish and he disappeared into the jungle. Rebellion In May 1742, Juan Santos along with a Yine (Piro) named Bisabequi appeared at the Franciscan mission called Quisopango at the southern edge of the Gran Pajonal a few kilometers north of the 21st century town of Puerto Ocopa. What he did or said is unknown but he gained support among the Amuesha and other indigenous people in addition to the Ash√°ninka. Within a few days half a dozen missions in the Cerro de la Sal and Chanchamayo region had been abandoned by the indigenous people. In June, a priest, Santiago V√°squez de Calcedo, journeyed to Quisopango to meet Juan Santos. From that contact and others reported by indigenous leaders, some of Santos's personality and aims became clearer. Santos said that he was a Christian and recited the creed in Latin. He had come to the Pajonal to reclaim \\"his kingdom.\\" He claimed to be a reincarnation of Atahualpa, the last Inca emperor. He was going to effect that reclamation with the help of indigenous people. Santos said he opposed violence, but he was going to expel the Spanish and their African slaves from Peru with the help of the British. (There is no evidence Santos was in contact with the British, but his claim of help from them was disturbing to the Spaniards.) The scholar Stefano Varese says the Santos's \\"attitudes were those of a moderate man\\" full of \\"mystical inspiration.\\" He based his rebellion, typical of Millenarianism in colonial societies, on religion. Juan Santos promised that the rebellion would bring peace and prosperity to all the Andes, beginning in the jungle and spreading to the highlands and the coast. Juan Santos said that the culmination of his rebellion would be his coronation as Sapa Inca (supreme ruler of Tawantinsuyu). Santos's aims seemed more directed at the highland peoples who had been subjects of the Inca Empire rather than the Ash√°ninka and other jungle peoples who had not been subjects and probably did not share his ambitious goals. As told to two African captives, their motivation in supporting Santos was that \\"they wanted no priests and they did not wish to be Christians.\\" Santos's initial hostility to Africans changed quickly and several former African slaves of the Franciscans became important supporters of the rebellion. The Africans were valued for their knowledge of European weapons and battle tactics. Many indigenous people and mestizos from the Andes also joined the rebellion. =Victory= Juan Santos and his supporters confronting Franciscan priests. The Franciscan priests, the laymen, and the converts living at twenty-one of the twenty-three missions in the central jungle fled to two surviving missions: Quimiri, near the 21st century city of La Merced, and Sonomoro near the 21st century town of San Martin de Pangoa. Juan Santos moved his base of operations east from Quisopango to the less isolated and more strategically located mission of Eneno on the Peren√© River in the Cerro de la Sal region. The first violence of the rebellion took place in September 1742 when a locally gathered militia force headed by three Franciscans sallied forth from Quimiri and were ambushed and killed. That same month two Spanish forces of regular soldiers were dispatched from the Andes to suppress the rebellion, but they failed to find Juan Santos. The Spanish built a fort in Quimiri and left 80 soldiers with artillery while most of the army withdrew to the city of Tarma in the Andes. Santos surrounded the fort and offered the Spanish safe passage to Tarma, but they rejected the offer. Attempting to supply the fort with food, a Spanish relief force from Tarma was ambushed and 17 men killed. Later, the desperate, starving Spanish soldiers decided to flee the fort, but they were intercepted by the indigenous forces and all 80 were killed. When a relief force of 300 men arrived at the fort in January 1743, they were greeted with cannon fire from the indigenous forces. The relief force withdrew. Only Sonomoro among the former missions remained in Spanish hands and Santos and his followers were left in uncontested control of a large swath of territory for more than two years. In 1746, the viceroy Jos√© Manso de Velasco sent a force of nearly 1,000 men into the Ash√°ninka territory. It was defeated more by the rain and the jungle rather than the indigenous army, estimated by the Spanish to number 500 but in reality only a widely dispersed part-time force of combatants. After that failure, the Spanish gave up attempts to suppress the rebellion, but instead built fortresses in Chanchamayo and Oxapampa to prevent the rebellion from expanding into the Andes highlands and its relatively large population. Nevertheless, incipient revolts broke out in three highland towns and were brutally repressed by the Spanish. A Franciscan expressed the Spanish fear. \\"If this (Santos)...headed for Lima with 200 Indian archers, one could fear...a generalized rebellion among all the Indians in the provinces of the Kingdom.\\" In 1750, the Spanish sent another military expedition into rebel territory and it was easily defeated by the guerrilla tactics of the Ash√°ninka and their allies. In 1751, groups of Ash√°ninka and their Piro allies advanced southward in what was more of an immigration than a military operation to take back former territories in the region of the towns of Satipo and Mazamari, and forcing the evacuation of the Spanish fortress in Sonomoro, the last of the 23 missions in the central jungle. In August 1752, Santos's rebellion reached its high water mark when he led an Ash√°ninka force which captured the highland town of Andamarca in Jauja Province and held it for three days before departing. Hoping perhaps to incite a highland rebellion, Santos avoided taking the lives of the residents and priests in the town. Having reclaimed their territory and expelled the Spanish, the active phase of the rebellion ended. The area liberated by the indigenous people from the Spanish was about from Pozuzo in the north to Andamarca in the south, marked by where the yungas merge with the high Andes. It extended about eastwards to the Ucayali River and its upstream tributaries.Google Earth Death and legacy The date and circumstances of the death of Juan Santos are unknown. After his capture of Andamarca in 1752, he disappeared. Most Spanish sources believe that he died in 1755 or 1756, although a Franciscan priest thought that he was still alive in 1775. In 1766, two Ash√°ninka followers of Santos said that \\"his body had disappeared in a cloud of smoke.\\" A small pile of rocks on the Cerro de la Sal commemorates him. In 1788 the Spanish endeavored once again to enter the territory that the Santos rebellion had wrested from them. The Spanish established two fortresses on the southern edge of the Chanchamayo region in Vitoc and Uchubamba. However, not until 1868 and the founding of the city of La Merced (near the old Franciscan mission of Quimiri) was most of the Chanchamayo and the Cerro de la Sal regions opened up to settlement by non- indigenous people.

It is the second largest town in Chin State. The town's four major boroughs (veng) are: Sakollam, Myoma, Lawibual and Leilum. The population is primarily Zomi.Zomi include the Kuki (Thados), the Manipur (Meitei and Paite), the Lusei (Mizo), the Laimi (Khalkha or Hakha and Thangtlang), and the Falam (Pawite). History The name \\"Tedim\\" was derived from a pool up in the hills that used to twinkle in the sunlight, therefore it was called \\"te (bright, shine)\\" and \\"dim (twinkling, sparkling)\\" in the local Zomi language. As the Zomi lacked a formal writing system in the past, the story of Tedim mostly depends on oral tradition. Establishment of Tedim is ascribed to Gui Mang II, a powerful prince from the then ruling Guite family in the region (c. 1600). However, due to the untimely death of Gui Lun (the fifth generation from Gui Mang II), Tedim was deserted for two generations. By the time of Pum Go, Tedim was reestablished as the political base of the Guite family. At the time of Mang Suum II, son of Pum Go, the allied force of the Pawihangs began their advance in the region and attacked Tedim. Tedim was again deserted by many, though some local residents survived under the leadership of Mang Gin from the Hatlang family.C. 1820, by C. Tuan. In 1840, in order to secure peace, the remaining citizens invited the leadership of Kam Hau of Mualbem, of the emerging Sukte family, since they had good military and political ties with the Zahau family of the Pawis.Sing K.

The current route is approximately long adorned with about 180 displays (70 of which are animated). An estimated 300,000 visitors converged at Tanglewood Park for the 2001 Festival of Lights as the event celebrated its 10th Anniversary and honored those who were killed on September 11, 2001. Today, over a million lights complete the light show. The festival has been recognized as a \\"Top 20 Event in the Southeast\\" and a \\"Top 100 Event in North America\\".  History  Among the earliest European settlers of the Yadkin River Valley was William Johnson, an immigrant from Wales. In 1757, just four years after the Moravian settlement of the Wachovia Tract in the nearby communities of Bethabara and Salem, Johnson purchased the mile square central portion of the present property from the Ellis family to whom the land was deeded in 1753 by Lord William Linville. The Ellis family leased the land for a short time \\"for five shillings lawful money of Great Britain in hand a yearly rent of one peppercorn payment at the Feast of Saint Michael, the archangel\\". After obtaining the property, Johnson built a fort overlooking the Yadkin River to protect his family and neighbors from attacks during the French and Indian War. Currently, this spot is marked by a monument just south of the Manor House. In 1765, he died and is now buried on the highest hill in the area called Mount Pleasant. In 1809 a simple frame church was erected next to his grave and remains today as one of the park's architectural attractions. Although services are no longer held there, many people are united in marriage at the Mount Pleasant Church each year. In 1859, James Johnson had the 18 room Manor House built on a hill in the center of the estate. The house was a gift of love to his daughter, Emily, for a wedding present. Two wings were added later. =Tanglewood Farm= The Johnson heirs sold their property in 1921 to William Neal Reynolds, brother of tobacco entrepreneur R. J. Reynolds. At that time the Tanglewood tract was enlarged to over and the Manor House expanded to 28 rooms. Mr. Will, as he was called, raised and raced Standardbred harness horses and established Tanglewood Farm as a home to some of the country's finest pacers. In the Manor House, Mr. Will had a special room dedicated to his trophies, called the \\"Trophy Room.\\" A fire that started mysteriously in a trophy room display case in 1980 did considerable damage, but the room has been restored. The room is surrounded by plaques and horse photographs. Mr. Will was a horse lover, and this tradition is carried on with Tanglewood Stables. Trail rides, hayrides, and carriage rides are available by reservation. Today, the Manor House is a Bed & Breakfast Inn with 10 guest rooms, sweeping staircases, the Trophy Room, 20's Room, and Rock Fireplace Room. These facilities are used for weddings, meetings, and overnight accommodations. Mr. Will's wife, Kate, a horticultural enthusiast, began the extensive native and ornamental plantings at Tanglewood and employed German master gardener, Mr. Frank Lustig, who continued her plans and his life's work. He contributed the 800 bush Rose Garden on the Manor House lawn, the Arboretum behind the house, and the nearby Fragrance Garden to the estate. For 60 years, even after the death of his employers, and their gift of the estate, Lustig poured his talents into Tanglewood. He is buried in the graveyard at Tanglewood next to the historic church. The Reynolds couple had no children, and, as a gesture enabling others to benefit from the beauty, elegance, history, and recreation their country estate had to offer, in 1951, they willed the Tanglewood property to the citizens of Forsyth County to share as a public recreational park. Thus, Tanglewood Park was born. The facility is owned by Forsyth County.  Cross country  Tanglewood Park was also the site for the NCHSAA State Championship for Cross Country for eight consecutive years between 2001-2009. The location of this cross country meet moved to Beeson Park in Kernersville, NC in 2010. Tanglewood Park is also the site for the Ascis 4runners only Invitational.

By 1962, after a series of pilot transmission tests, the project was quickly taken over by the Ayub Khan Government in 1963 for the \\"greater national interest of Pakistan\\". President Ayub Khan re-appointed Ubaidur Rahman in 1963 under the Ministry of Information to continue with the NEC joint venture collaboration to launch Pakistan Television or PTV. The project began with a tent on the back lot of Radio Pakistan Lahore where a transmission tower and a studio were constructed. On November 26, 1964 the first official television station commenced transmission broadcasts from Lahore, followed by Dhaka in 1965 (then the capital of East Pakistan). A third centre was established in Rawalpindi- Islamabad in 1965 and the fourth in Karachi in 1966. Later centres in Peshawar and Quetta were established by 1974. PTV was given under Television Promoters Company in 1966 which was established under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the same year. TPC was upgraded to Pakistan Television Corp in 1967. In 1972 PTV Corporation was nationalized. Originally broadcast in black and white, PTV began colour transmission in 1976.History of Pakistan Television Network With this new upgrade in techniques and equipment, the Pakistan Television Academy was founded and opened in 1987 to teach students who wished to work in the medium. As with the other agreement, the government financed most of the funds while the private venture capitalists offered to fund the remainder. Late 1980s morning transmission started on PTV. In 1990, the then government launched the first semi government TV network of the country by the name of \\"Peoples Television Network (PTN)under the Peoples TV Network, a wholly owned company of Shalimar Recording Company (which is Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company now). PTN, the wholly owned company was merged with Shalimar Recording Company in 1991 and the TV Channel PTN was renamed as Shalimar Television Network (STN). PTN/STN started from Islamabad first and then from Karachi, Lahore and by mid-1990s the network made its way to the whole of the country. STN for the first time in Pakistan started the programmings of CNN International on the terrestrial beam, this was the first project of STN. Soon programs of BBC World started. In 1990, PTN under an agreement with the a private company (Inter-flow) started first ever private TV slot of Pakistan, Network Television Marketing (NTM), in this way STN's broadcast became the combination of programings of CNN, slot of NTM and limited broadcasts of programmings of BBC World and German DW TV. This successfully continued till 1999. NTM came as a breath of fresh air to the Pakistani viewers due to its fresh and innovative programmings. PTV Network launched a full-scale satellite broadcasting service in 1991-1992. PTV-2, the first ever satellite channel of Pakistan started in 1992. In 1994, PTV was made part of the satellite beam along with PTV-2. PTV 2 was renamed as PTV World in 1998. PTV-2/World also enjoyed viewership on terrestrial beam. In 1998 PTV in association with a private company (Prime Entertainment Network) started PTV Prime, exclusively for European and later for American viewers. Digital TV satellite broadcasting was launched in 1999. PTV/PTV-1 got its satellite beam (independent of PTV 2/World)in 2001. NTM went off air in 1999 due to financial losses and with that STN also shut down CNN Intn'l broadcast, limited programmings BBC World and DW TV in 1999. STN was taken over by PTV Network in 1999 and was given new name Channel-3 which started its transmissions on regular basis in 2000. A satellite beam of STN/Channel-3 was also arranged. In 2000, the then government of Pakistan opened up new ways for the media industry of Pakistan by allowing private TV channels to operate openly even to telecast their own news and current affairs content. Indus Vision (first ever private satellite channel of Pakistan) was launched in 2000. ARY Digital was launched in 2001, Geo TV in 2002, Aaj TV in 2004 and Hum TV was launched in 2005, and the phenomenon went on. In 2005 Channel-3 went off air and with that Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company renamed its TV channel to ATV (a joint venture of Shalimar Rec. & Broadcast. Co. & SSI) and ATV started its transmission as the only semi-private TV channel of Pakistan being shown on terrestrial as well as satellite beam (Now ATV is working as semi-government TV Channel as SRBC has not extended its agreement with SSI). In 2007, PTV or PTV-1 was given a new name PTV Home and PTV World went off air (PTV World restarted in 2012-13 as the only English language/pure satellite channel of Pakistan). PTV News replaced PTV World in 2007. PTV Home, PTV News (both state owned) and ATV (semi private) channels are shown on terrestrial beams along with the satellite beam. While recently started PTV Sports becomes available on terrestrial beams in place of either PTV Home or PTV News only during the important national and international sports events. PTV Prime went out of PTV's purview in 2005 as an independent Prime TV ; PTV launched an exclusive channel for Americas & Europe in 2006 i.e. PTV Global.

(died c. 31 BC) was a Roman politician and general during the final years of the republic. He was consul in the year 36 BC, and was the son of Lucius Gellius, who had been consul in 72 BC. He was accused of committing incest with his stepmother, and of conspiring against his father's life; but although the latter was nearly convinced of his guilt, he allowed him to plead his cause before a large number of senators, and, in consequence of their opinion, declared him innocent.Valerius Maximus, Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium Libri Novem, v.9.¬ß1. After the death of Caesar in 44 BC, Gellius supported the republican party, and went with Marcus Junius Brutus to Asia. Here he was detected plotting to take the life of Brutus but was pardoned at the intercession of his half-brother, Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Shortly afterwards he entered into a conspiracy to kill Gaius Cassius Longinus, but again escaped unpunished through the intercession of his mother Polla.Dio Cassius, Roman History, xlvii.24; Livy, Periochae, 122. It seems that Polla had been divorced from her first husband Gellius (senior) and had then married Marcus Valerius Messalla.

The name derives from the original name of Camino del Rey (King's Pathway), abbreviated locally to el caminito.The Rough Guide to Andalucia, 1995 The walkway had fallen into disrepair and was partially closed for over a decade. After four years of extensive repairs and renovations, the walkway re-opened in 2015. It has been known in the past as the \\"world's most dangerous walkway\\" following five deaths in 1999 and 2000. History The walkway was built to provide workers at the hydroelectric power plants at Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls with a means to cross between them, to provide for transport of materials, and to help facilitate inspection and maintenance of the channel. The construction began in 1901 and was finished in 1905. King Alfonso XIII crossed the walkway in 1921 for the inauguration of the dam Conde del Guadalhorce, and it became known by its present name. The walkway is in width and rises over above the river below. Traversing a collapsed section in 2006 The original path was constructed of concrete and rested on steel rails supported by stanchions built at approximately 45 degrees into the rock face. It deteriorated over the years, and there were numerous sections where part or all of the concrete top had collapsed. The result was large open-air gaps bridged only by narrow steel beams or other supports. Few of the original handrails existed, although a safety wire ran the length of the path. Several people lost their lives on the walkway and, after two fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000, the local government closed both entrances. Even so, in the four years leading up to 2013, four people died attempting to climb the gorge. Current state of El Caminito del Rey, with the original pathway at the bottom and new pathway at the top The regional government of Andalusia and the local government of M√°laga agreed in June 2011 to share costs of restoration (including car parking and a museum) of ‚Ç¨9 million. The project took approximately three years to complete. Many of the original features remained in place. In March 2014, the cornerstone of the rehabilitation project was laid by specialized alpinists.The Caminito del Rey will open Easter (29th March) 2015 13 March 2014 The walkway reopened on 29 March 2015, and Lonely Planet listed it in the best new attractions for 2015. Route description and GPS track is available in Wikiloc with information, photos, and videos to help visitors. The new pathway still offers a walk of 2.9 km along the side of the gorge. In film In the film Scent of Mystery released in 1960, also known as Holiday in Spain there is a chase scene towards the end of the film that takes place on the Caminito del Rey where the hero (Denholm Elliott) and his cohort (Peter Lorre) are chased by the antagonist (Paul Lucas). At the end of the chase Paul Lucas is run down by a train in a tunnel that is also part of the Park complex. Some of the final scenes of the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express were shot at the confluence of the gateway and the railway.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjcZGvytKaU&t;=3m26s In the film, they stand for the Italian-Swiss border. Some of the area's deterioration is directly attributable to the crashing of planes into the cliffs during the filming. An extended sequence in the 2012 Spanish thriller The End was filmed on the Caminito.

After the death of the bishop, Fran√ßois Caulet, Aubarede was chosen vicar capitular. As administrator of the diocese, he took up and carried on vigorously the resistance of Caulet to the royal demands in the matter of the droit de r√©gale. He refused to recognize royal nominations to local ecclesiastical benefices, and excommunicated the canons appointed by the king, when they attempted to exercise their office. He was arrested by royal order, and imprisoned for six years at Caen, where he died. B. Jungmann remarks (in Herder, K.L., I, 1567) that the Jansenist rigorism of Caulet and his clergy was partly responsible for their stubborn defiance of Louis XIV; they feared that the nominees of the king would not belong to their faction.

It is adjacent, and runs parallel to, the Loughor road bridge. The 1880 viaduct was granted Grade II listed building status. Before it was demolished in early 2013, the viaduct was the last remaining timber viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.‚ÄúLoughor trestle viaduct, site of.‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äô engineering-timelines.com‚Äô‚Äô, Retrieved: 8 June 2018. The Loughor viaduct was constructed to carry the broad gauge South Wales Railway (SWR) west of Swansea to Carmarthen. It was opened to traffic (broad gauge and standard gauge) in 1852. The viaduct was rebuilt several times; modifications made include the removal of its swing bridge and broad gauge tracks, replacement of the timber deck with an iron structure, and additional piles. In 1986, due to structural concerns, the track was singled and speed restrictions were imposed adding to journey times. In the early 2010s, Network Rail commissioned a new-build replacement. Work by contractor Carillion, took place during March and April 2013. The railway was closed for 16 days to allow for the removal of the old viaduct and the installation of the new bridge. On 8 April 2013, the new bridge with its doubled track line was opened to traffic. A section of the original viaduct was preserved alongside the new structure.  History  = Original construction = The South Wales Railway (Chepstow to Fishguard) Act of 1845 received royal assent and the South Wales Railway (SWR) began construction of the line. It required the construction of a viaduct over the River Loughor which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Lavington Evans Fletcher, Brunel's assistant and the resident engineer, designed the movement mechanism for the swing bridge. According to Isambard Brunel Junior, the viaduct was typical of his father's numerous viaducts, especially those that were built on coastal lines for the SWR. It had seventeen fixed spans of similar size and was built of timber. It was 750 ft long. To prevent river traffic being obstructed, the viaduct had a 40 ft opening swing bridge at the Swansea (east) end. As constructed, it was supported on timber piles driven 14 feet into the sand and clay bed of the river. The piles were arranged in groups of three, across the width of the viaduct. Above them, a timber deck was laid to carry a double track; the deck rested on timber baulks. On 17 September 1852, the first train crossed the viaduct; regular services commenced on 11 October 1852. The delay in its opening has been attributed to a shortage of Barlow rails for the permanent way. The tracks on the viaduct were laid as mixed-gauge track, broad gauge for use by the SWR and standard gauge for the Llanelly Railway. During May 1872, the SWR transitioned to standard gauge, and the broad gauge tracks were redundant. = 1880 rebuilding = Loughor railway viaduct, the pre-2013 bridge During 1880, the viaduct was rebuilt. The original piles were either retained or strengthened using wrought iron fixtures. A new iron deck replaced the timber deck. To support it, three longitudinal wrought iron H-girders were laid along viaduct. The deck was constructed of surplus Barlow rails, which were laid widthways. As the SWR having had converted to standard gauge during 1872, the tracks were re-laid as a standard gauge baulk road. Barlow rail was widely used for civil engineering tasks, including Clevedon Pier but it became apparent that lightweight bridge rail was too light for prolonged use and tended to spread, leading to inaccurate gauge and risk of derailments. Large quantities were available cheaply. The SWR offered 400 tons of Barlow rail for sale in 1857, with free delivery anywhere along the line. = 1909 rebuilding = Between 1908 and 1909, a major rebuild was carried out. The original piers were replaced, cut off at the lower waling level and new timber piles driven alongside. The configuration of piers was changed from a three-pile arrangement to four-pile. The deck supports were changed, longitudinal wrought iron girders were replaced with deeper steel plate. The swing bridge, which was last used during 1887 was removed and replaced by a fixed girder. = 1979‚Äì1981 refurbishment = An Arriva Trains Wales British Rail Class 175 crossing over the Loughor viaduct Between 1979 and 1981, the viaduct underwent an extensive refurbishment programme. It was overseen by the civil engineer Christopher Loudon Wallis and described as being 'sympathetic' to the original structure, retaining a large proportion of its original timber. It was discovered that the river bed beneath the viaduct had been severely eroded necessitating the addition of tipping stones to protect the timber. In 1986 the viaduct was limited to single-track operation as a consequence of concerns over its structural safety by British Rail. Freight and passenger trains were subject to speed restrictions, which led to delays and longer journey times. In October 1998, the Loughor Viaduct was listed and awarded Grade II status. The 1880 viaduct was the only remaining viaduct designed by Brunel that relied upon timber for a substantial proportion of its structure until its replacement during 2013. = 2013 replacement = The viaduct is on a five- mile section of railway between Cockett and Duffryn, which was from double to single track operation during 1986. During 2012 and 2013, work to re-double the section allowed an increase in train services over this stretch of line.‚ÄúNAW ‚Äì Inquiry into the Future Rail Infrastructure in Wales.‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôWelsh Assembly‚Äô‚Äô, 27 November 2009. Network Rail also commissioned a replacement for the Loughor Viaduct by a new bridge. By this point, the viaduct was unable to take the weight of two trains at once limiting its operational use. Foundations being piled for the new bridge, July 2012 Carillion was awarded the contract for the new bridge, and consulting engineers, Tony Gee & Partners designed it.‚ÄúLoughor Rail Viaduct (2013).‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôengineering-timelines.com‚Äô‚Äô, Retrieved: 8 June 2018. The bridge is a 235 meters long, seven-span steel and concrete structure. The deck is a shallow slab, supported by deeper main girders, allowing the level to match its predecessor. The completed deck has a topping of reinforced concrete, waterproofing measures and ballast. During construction the track was temporarily covered with rubber mats so that construction vehicles did not damage the track. The replacement bridge had to address operational, heritage and environmental concerns which influenced the methods of construction and other decisions. The bridge was built adjacent to the viaduct which remained in use. Once completed, the new bridge was slid sideways into position using hydraulic jacks over 14 hours after the viaduct had been speedily demolished. This meant that the railway was closed for just 16 days. Work started on the bridge on 24 March 2013 and it was officially completed in early April 2013.‚ÄúWork to replace the Loughor Viaduct near Swansea is complete.‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôNetwork Rail‚Äô‚Äô, April 2013.‚ÄúSurveys point plans new viaduct river mouth.‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äôthisissouthwales.co.uk‚Äô‚Äô, Retrieved: 30 April 2012.

The area is bordered by Burnet Road and Allandale to the west, North Lamar Boulevard and North Loop on the east, 45th Street and Rosedale to the south, and Justin Lane and Crestview to the north. Running through the middle of the area is a tree-lined street named Arroyo Seco, which follows a creek of the same name. The neighborhood of Brentwood in north central Austin was originally a cotton farm until the late 1940s when the City of Austin annexed the land and land was purchased to build a school, Brentwood Elementary, which opened in the early 1950s. Brentwood Park opened that same year. Many of the homes in Brentwood are bungalow style. Bungalows are normally one and a half stories and have a low pitched roof and horizontal shape. Many of the bungalows were two and three bedrooms and were purchased by GIs who desired to start families after World War II. Demographics According to the 2000 census, 86% of the Brentwood population is over the age of 18, and the average household size is 1.9 persons. Only 17% of the population is over the age of 65. Forty-five percent of the neighborhood's residents are from 25 to 44 years of age, and 50% of the homes occupied in Brentwood are one-person households. Just over 20% of the neighborhood's total population are Hispanic American or Latino, while 74% of Brentwood's population are White, 1.8% are Asian, and 2.3% are Black or African American. Among people over age 25, approximately 57% have a bachelor's degree or higher, while 28% percent are currently enrolled in graduate school. The median family income, according to the 2000 census was $42,616. Only 5% of Brentwood residents work outside Travis County.

Ten percent of residents carpool, and five percent use public transportation.U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Summary File 3. The 2000 Census also reported just over 4,275 housing units in Brentwood, mostly single-family homes. Large, modern apartment complexes and condominiums are located on most of the district's primary and secondary thoroughfares, many of which are home to young professionals and students attending the University of Texas. Recreation Brentwood is divided by a wide median creek on which stand many large trees on Arroyo Seco. These 150 trees were planted in February 1993 through public and state contributions to the Austin Energy Planting for the Future Fund, a special fund of the Texas Parks and Recreation Department. Nearby popular attractions include the mosaic Wall of Welcome, which was completed and dedicated in March 2008. Public open space includes Brentwood Park, spanning just over , with tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds and a playscape. Only 1% of the Brentwood neighborhood is public open space, but plans for the neighborhood include a neighborhood dog park at a location yet to be decided. Brentwood is known for its native old-fashioned bars and hamburger joints, some of which date to the 1930s. Threadgill's was frequented by Janis Joplin when she attended the University of Texas in the 1960s. Local traditions include annual events sponsored by the neighborhood nonprofit Violet Crown Community Works, which helped raise funds to make the Wall of Welcome possible, and the annual holiday decoration of the canal along Arroyo Seco with luminarias.

It now hangs in the Basilica of Saint Clare (Basilica di Santa Chiara) in Assisi, Italy, with a replica in its original position in the church of San Damiano nearby. Franciscans cherish this cross as the symbol of their mission from God. The cross is a crucifix of a type sometimes called an icon cross because in addition to the main figure of the Christ, it contains images of other saints and people related to the incident of Christ's crucifixion. The tradition of such painted crucifixes began in the Eastern Church and possibly reached Italy via Montenegro and Croatia. History The San Damiano Cross was one of a number of crosses painted with similar figures during the 12th century in Umbria. The name of the painter is unknown, but it was made around the year 1100. The purpose of an icon cross was to teach the meaning of the event depicted and thereby strengthen the faith of the people.Scanlon T.O.R.,Michael. \\"A Brief Explanation\\", The Franciscans The Byzantine style was common in Italy before Cimabue and Giotto. According to Franciscan tradition, it was while praying before this cross in the chapel of San Damiano, just outside Assisi, that Francis of Assisi received a call to rebuild the Church. When the Poor Clares moved from San Damiano to the Basilica of Santa Chiara in 1257, they took the original San Damiano Cross with them and still guard it with great solicitude. It now hangs in the Basilica over the altar of the Chapel of the CrucifixThe Catholic Exchange, 10/05/2007a reconstruction of the Church of Saint George, which was torn down to build the Basilica. The crucifix hanging over the altar of the ancient church of San Damiano is a copy. Franciscans regard this cross as a symbol of their mission to commit their lives and resources to renewing and rebuilding the Church. Description Jesus Christ is represented upright in full stature while the surrounding figures are smaller. The bright white of his body contrasts with the dark red and black around it and accentuates the prominence of Jesus. This representation contrasts with the regal Christ portrayed on the cross in earlier centuries and the suffering, dying, crucified Christ depicted generally throughout the Church since the beginning of the 14th century. Above the head of Christ is the inscription in Latin: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.Scanlon T.O.R., Michael. The San Damiano Cross: An Explanation, Franciscan University Press, Steubenville, Ohio, 1983 The next largest figures are five witnesses of the crucifixion. On the left side are the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist. On the right side are Mary Magdalene, Mary, Mother of James, and the centurion who in Matthew's Gospel account asks Christ to heal his servant, who is also depicted on the cross on the shoulder of the centurion (Matthew 8:5-13). Both Mary and Mary Magdalene have their hands placed on their cheeks to reflect extreme grief and anguish. The first four witnesses are saints and are therefore represented with halos. Their names are written beneath their pictures. Two smaller figures are located in the corners with the witnesses. On the lower left is Longinus the traditional name of the Roman soldier who pierced the side of Jesus with a lance. He is represented here as holding the lance and looking up at Jesus. The blood running down the right arm of Jesus begins at the elbow and drips straight down and will land on the upturned face of Longinus. In the lower right is Stephaton, the traditional name for the soldier who offered Jesus the sponge soaked in vinegar wine. Peering over the left shoulder of the centurion is a small face. A close look reveals the tops of the heads of three others beside him. This represents the centurion's son who was healed by Jesus and the rest of his family to show that \\"he and his whole household believed\\" (John 4:45-54). Six angels are represented as marvelling over the event of the crucifixion. They are positioned at both ends of the crossbar. Their hand gestures indicate they are discussing this wondrous event of the death and calling us to marvel with them. At the foot of the cross there is a damaged picture of six figures, two of whom are represented with halos. In accordance with the traditions of the day, these six are the patrons of Umbria: St. Damian, St. Michael, St. Rufino, St. John the Baptist, St. Peter and St. Paul. On the top of the cross, one sees Jesus now fully clothed in his regal garments and carrying the cross as a triumphant sceptre. He is climbing out of the tomb and into the heavenly courts. Ten angels are crowded around, five of whom have their hands extended in a welcoming gesture to Jesus, who himself has his hand raised in the form of a greeting, At the very top of the cross is the Hand of God with two fingers extended. This is to be understood as the blessing of God the Father on the sacrifice of his Son. On the right side of the picture next to the left calf of Jesus, there is a small figure of a fowl. Some art historians have interpreted it to be a rooster, representing the sign of Jesus' denial by Peter, mentioned in all four Gospel accounts. Other commentators see it as a peacock, a frequent symbol of immortality in Early Christian art. Along the lower right side of the shaft, there is a small animal, possibly a cat. Controversy Some versions of this cross have been criticized because they perceive it to be showing the genitals of Jesus, specifically in the version in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, this led to other versions being criticized for the same reason. This led to the modification of the cross at the congregation of Warr Acres while other have remained unchanged.

On a Spare the Air day, Bay Area residents are asked through radio and television announcements to reduce their driving, refrain from using gas-powered gardening equipment and curb other air polluting activities such as painting and aerosol spray can usage. People especially sensitive to smog are advised to limit their time outdoors. Spare the Air nights are also issued during the winter when particulate emissions often coming from wood burning and other activities become trapped in stagnant air masses. During winter Spare the Air nights, wood burning is banned and violators may have to attend a class or pay a fine of up to $500. Exceptions are allowed if a household has a power outage. Barbecues are permitted on a Spare the Air Day, but are discouraged and the use of lower-pollution gas fuels rather than wood or charcoal is recommended.Spare the Air Winter - Frequently Asked Questions Free transportation days BART rides are available on selected Spare the Air days. Non-compliance with federal air pollution standards can mean losing federal money for transportation projects like wider roads, new bridges, and mass transit. To avoid these penalties, each year for a certain number of Spare the Air days that occur on non-holiday weekdays, many Bay Area transit agencies offer free rides to encourage public transportation use over cars. The number of allocated fare-free days varies from year to year, depending on available funding. This program's subsidy drew increased media attention in 2006 when the traditional three annual free days jumped to six in response to the number of annual Spare the Air days declared being the highest in seven years.BAY AREA / 4th Spare Air day this year - gasp / Extra state funds for transit assistance arrived last week In past years there have been multiple free transit Spare the Air days. However, in 2008, the number was reduced to only one free transit day, June 19. There has been no free transit program since 2009.

University of California, Berkeley researcher Aaron Golub calculated the cost per ton of pollution removed as a result of Spare the Air was estimated at $100,000 per ton for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons and $10 million per ton for particulate matter, compared to $5,000 and $20,000 per ton respectively for a pollution reduction program.Sparing ourselves pollution solutions The cost for Spare the Air free fares is about $2 million a day, and MTC has claimed that the goal of the program is not reducing air pollution, but rather as an incentive for people to consider public transit.don't blow it out the tailpipe just yet - The Capricious Commuter - Getting around the Bay Area with Erik N.

Within the United States, U.S. attorneys in many states and territories must complete certain required CLE in order to maintain their U.S. licenses to practice law. Outside the United States, lawyers in various jurisdictions, such as British Columbia in Canada, must also complete certain required CLE. However, some jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia and Israel, recommend, but do not require, that attorneys complete CLE. Australia * In New South Wales continuing legal education is regulated by the Law Society of New South Wales. United States No nationwide rules exist within the United States for CLE requirements or accreditation. Instead, each individual jurisdiction (i.e., each state, the District of Columbia, and each territory) exercises discretion on how to regulate U.S. attorneys, which includes establishing rules for CLE requirements and accreditation. This authority is typically vested in each jurisdiction's supreme court and delegated to special CLE commissions or boards.ABA Mandatory CLE Information. Nonetheless, various efforts have been made to promote uniformity of CLE programs across U.S. jurisdictions. For example, the American Bar Association (ABA) promulgated a model CLE rule for individual jurisdictions to adopt.ABA Model Rule for Continuing Legal Education . Similarly, the Continuing Legal Education Regulators Association (CLEreg) created a uniform CLE application, a uniform CLE attendance certification, and a CLE distance learning glossary.CLEreg Standardized CLE Forms. CLEreg also created a CLE guide to assist its members in managing CLE programs.CLEreg CLE Guide. In U.S. jurisdictions with mandatory CLE requirements, attorneys must typically earn a minimum number of CLE credits (measured in hours) over a set period of years. Also, some of these jurisdictions require a minimum number of CLE credits for specific topics (e.g., ethics, diversity training, elimination of bias, professional responsibility, basic skills, substance abuse, prevention of malpractice, and attorney-client disputes). U.S. attorneys typically earn CLE credits by completing legal training presented by experienced attorneys. The training may cover both legal theory and practical experiences in legal practice. Competency testing is not usually required in order for attorneys to earn CLE credits through legal training. Classroom training materials can be extensive and may represent the most current and advanced thinking available on a particular legal subject. Oftentimes, a portion of CLE credits may be earned through reading and other self-study. In recent years, many jurisdictions now allow attorneys to earn CLE credits as part of distance education courses taken on-line or by listening to audio downloads. Alternatively, experienced attorneys in some jurisdictions, such as New York, may also earn CLE credits for speaking or teaching at accredited CLE programs; for moderating or participating in panel presentations at accredited CLE activities; for teaching law courses at ABA-accredited law schools; for preparing students for and judging law competitions, mock trials and moot court arguments, including those at the high school or college level; for published legal research-based writing; and for providing pro bono legal services.New York State's Continuing Legal Education: FAQs for Experienced Attorneys. Legal training or other activities often meet the rules for CLE requirements and accreditation in multiple jurisdictions. In these instances, nothing prohibits attorneys licensed in one or more of these jurisdictions from counting the training or other activities towards fulfillment of their CLE credit requirements for each of these jurisdictions. Opportunities for CLE are offered throughout the year by state bar associations, national legal organizations such as the American Bar Association, Federal Bar Association, law schools, and many other legal associations and groups such as non-profit CLE providers Practising Law Institute (PLI), American Law Institute Continuing Legal Education (ALI CLE; formerly American Law Institute-American Bar Association ALI-ABA), The Center for American and International Law (CAIL), and The Institute of American & Talmudic Law (IAT Law), as well as other private, for-profit enterprises. Activities are usually open to all lawyers (and sometimes non-lawyers), but organizations often offer discounts to their own members. A recent trend is toward the provision and promotion of free CLE programs. Uniquely, Kentucky allows all licensed attorneys in the state to complete their annual CLE requirement without a registration fee through a two-day program known as Kentucky Law Update, offered annually in at least seven locations throughout the state. Click on the \\"About KLU\\" link in the menu on the left side of the page. Some attorneys, particularly those who have spent many years in active practice, have resisted CLE requirements as unconstitutional. However, in 1999, the Supreme Court of California upheld that state's CLE program against an Equal Protection Clause constitutional challenge.Warden v. State Bar, 21 Cal. 4th 628 (1999).  Canada  In Canada, rules vary by jurisdiction (i.e., provinces and territories). For example, Alberta has a mandatory Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program, requiring preparation of annual CPD plans. Lawyers develop their plans and declare to the Law Society of Alberta on an annual basis that these are complete. The Legal Education Society of Alberta provides tools to facilitate compliance with these requirements. In Ontario the Law Society of Upper Canada, beginning in 2010, instituted mandatory CPD hours for all lawyers in the province. In British Columbia, CPD is mandatoryhttps://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=706&t;=continuing- professional-development and lawyers are required to annually report their continuing legal education activities to the Law Society of British Columbia.

Work collective councils  \\"Work collective councils\\" (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—ã —Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–æ–≤‚ÄîSTKs) were created throughout the Soviet Union in 1987 with the \\"Law on State Enterprises\\" as part of the perestroika reforms. They were intended to foster democratization and increase efficiency in Soviet industry. When the Supreme Soviet of the Moldovan SSR proposed establishing Moldavian as the official language of the republic, at first with Russian as a coequal official language and later without, activist industrial leaders and workers used the STKs as a forum for discussion of the legislation and exploited the institutional structure of the STKs to take control of Moldovan industry.  Strike campaign  As communism began to collapse at the end of the 1980s, people throughout the Soviet Union began to demand national sovereignty. While the idea of creating a nation-state independent of the Soviet Union, and possibly in a union with Romania, had a great deal of popularity throughout much of the Moldovan SSR, many industrial workers from Moldova's eastern periphery felt that their country was the Soviet Union and worked to prevent this \\"nationalization\\" of the Moldovan SSR. When it was leaked to the press that the Moldovan Supreme Soviet was about to establish Moldavian as the only official language, industrial leaders and workers in the eastern city of Tiraspol created the United Work Collective Council (OSTK) to coordinate the activities of the city's many individual work collective councils. In effect, during this early period, the OSTK worked as a strike committee and used the work collective councils that existed in each state-run enterprise to shut down production. When the OSTK was created on 11 August 1989, the first congress elected as its new chairman Boris Shtefan, a shop foreman from the \\"Elektromash\\" Electronics Concern and the chairman of that factory's STK.Efim Bershin, Dikoe pole: Pridnestrovskii razlom (Moscow: Tekst, 2002), 21 The OSTK expanded quickly to cities throughout the Moldovan SSR and during the period of 16 August 16 to 22 September 1989, the OSTK brought over 200 factories and other state-run enterprises into the strike campaign. At its peak in early September, over 100,000 workers participated in the strike.Viktor Emel‚Äôianov, Za rodinu i prava cheloveka: desiat‚Äô let bor‚Äôby pridnestrovtsev za svobodu pod znamenem OSTK, 1989-1999 gg. (Tiraspol‚Äô: Tipar, 1999), 27. However, in the face of as many as half a million demonstrators in the Moldovan capital demanding passage of the language laws, the strike campaign did not affect the course of events in the Supreme Soviet of the Moldovan SSR.  Evolution to a political party  When the strike campaign failed to produce the expected results, OSTK activists turned their attention to upcoming elections. Using institutional resources and popularity acquired during the strike campaign, OSTK activists worked to get sympathizers elected to office, both on local and republican levels. OSTK candidates fared well in the 25 February elections. In eastern Moldova, OSTK supporters took control of most of the major city and regional (rayon) soviets. In Tiraspol, Igor Smirnov, later the president of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, was able to handily defeat the Communist Party candidate for the position of chairman of the city Soviet. In the Supreme Soviet of the Moldovan SSR, however, the OSTK candidates were too few to affect legislation.They made up approximately 15 percent of that body. See: \\"Ofitsial‚Äônyi sait prezidenta Pridnestrovskoi Moldavskoi Respubliki,\\" http://president-pmr.org/index.htm The power of the OSTK peaked in late 1989 and early 1990 when it controlled the republic's industrial enterprises. Once OSTK sympathizers were able to take control of governmental institutions, these proved to be much more expedient tools for achieving their goals. The OSTK continues in its role as a \\"social organization\\".

It is even believed by some that the name gets passed on from generation to generation. Upon his first appearance, the villain wanted to kill innocents to lure Iron Fist out of hiding, as Fist was his real target. The plan worked and Iron Fist revealed himself, and despite Scimitar's speed and fighting skills, Iron Fist was still able to defeat the villain. He had a few more run-ins with Iron Fist and his partner Luke Cage, but always ended up defeated. Scimitar disappeared from the comic pages for a long time, until he got revived in the 90's Iron Fist limited series.

Biography Raoul is a viscount and Christine Daa√©'s childhood friend. They first met when he was a young child when he went on vacation in Northern France. He meets up with her again after watching her performance at the former managers' retirement ceremony at the Palais Garnier. He reminds her that he is \\"the little boy who went into the sea to rescue your scarf,\\" which provokes her laughter. At first, Christine refuses to recognize Raoul, in fear that the \\"Angel of Music\\" would return to heaven. However, they become engaged later. Unknown to them, Erik, the \\"Angel of Music\\" of which Christine speaks (actually a musical genius who lives beneath the Opera), had been spying on them. On the day they were going to elope, Erik abducts her during a performance of Faust at the opera house. Raoul then, along with the mysterious man known only as The Persian, goes down into the cellars of the Opera in an attempt to rescue Christine. He and the Persian endure near-drowning and torture in a mirrored, super-heated chamber before Erik eventually relents due to Christine's willingness to sacrifice her happiness for Raoul's life. Raoul nearly commits suicide under torture, and, when Christine's marriage promise to Erik saves them, has to be put to bed by Erik because of a poison that has left him \\"limp as a rag.\\" In Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera, Raoul is described as having a 'small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes, and a complexion like a girl's and an air of \\"just having left the women's apron- strings.\\"' His elder brother and former guardian, Comte Philippe de Chagny, is a man of the world who indulges in dalliances with the Opera's ballerinas and is exasperated by his brother's attachment to \\"the little baggage\\" Christine. Philippe later drowns when he goes looking for Raoul in the cellars of the Opera. Raoul is described as 'having been petted by his two sisters and his aunt' and spoiled as a child, but he is very kind-hearted. Raoul has been to sea, and had plans to go on a rescue expedition to the North Pole before falling in love with Christine. Christine decided they would play at being engaged as was scheduled to leave the country, although she later begged him to take her away from the Phantom, no matter how much she resisted later. He is puzzled and sometimes angered by her allegiance to Erik, and thinks that she may be toying with his heart. He is the youngest member of his family, with an older brother (Philippe De Chagny) and two sisters already married. However, in the film adaptation of the Lloyd Webber musical, he mentions his still living parents (who had died long before the events of the novel). As Raoul has a living older brother at the time of his introduction, it is safe to infer that the title of Viscount is a courtesy title.

He was born in London, the son of a Dutch artist and a French noblewoman. He was educated at St Paul's School and at Oxford University. During the 1930s, de Groot worked as a news and feature writer, film writer, and director. When World War II broke out, he joined the British Ministry of Information and worked for the BBC, where, during The Blitz of London, he suffered eye injuries that would leave him totally blind within 20 years. In 1941, De Groot emigrated to the United States and worked for the U.S. State Department. According to his obituary in the New York Times, de Groot gave up his Dutch title in 1945, when he became an American citizen. In 1948, he married the British actress Katherine Hynes and they lived in a house on Bleecker Street in New York's Greenwich Village with his seeing-eye dog companion, Atena. Of their three daughters, the youngest was given up for adoption, while the two elder daughters, Fiona and Christina, lived with their parents. In the 1960s, as his vision failed, he switched careers and took up food writing, something he could do with his remaining senses. He wrote for Esquire, Ladies Home Journal, Playboy, House Beautiful, Vintage, McCall's, Gourmet, Time and The New York Times. De Groot's \\"Recipes from The Auberge of the Flowering Hearth\\" (Auberge de l'Atre Fleuri) published in 1973 is a classic in its field. It is the story of how de Groot went to France to seek out the history of the liqueur Chartreuse. In doing so, he discovered the world of two women who cooked with the seasons, which became the focus of the book. He later moved with his wife, Kathryn, and his seeing-eye dog companion, Nusta, to the Westbeth Artists' Colony in Greenwich Village. De Groot died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly as a result of depression caused by his failing health. His wife died of a stroke at age 88 on March 27, 1993.

An ichnotaxon (plural ichnotaxa) is \\"a taxon based on the fossilized work of an organism\\", i.e. the non-human equivalent of an artifact. Ichnotaxa comes from the Greek ŒØœáŒΩŒøœÇ, ichnos meaning track and œÑŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, taxis meaning ordering.Definition of 'ichno' at dictionary.com. Ichnotaxa are names used to identify and distinguish morphologically distinctive ichnofossils, more commonly known as trace fossils. They are assigned genus and species ranks by ichnologists, much like organisms in Linnaean taxonomy. These are known as ichnogenera and ichnospecies, respectively. \\"Ichnogenus\\" and \\"ichnospecies\\" are commonly abbreviated as \\"igen.\\" and \\"isp.\\". The binomial names of ichnospecies and their genera are to be written in italics. Most researchers classify trace fossils only as far as the ichnogenus rank, based upon trace fossils that resemble each other in morphology but have subtle differences. Some authors have constructed detailed hierarchies up to ichnosuperclass, recognizing such fine detail as to identify ichnosuperorder and ichnoinfraclass, but such attempts are controversial. Naming Due to the chaotic nature of trace fossil classification, several ichnogenera hold names normally affiliated with animal body fossils or plant fossils. For example, many ichnogenera are named with the suffix -phycus due to misidentification as algae. Edward Hitchcock was the first to use the now common -ichnus suffix in 1858, with Cochlichnus. History Due to trace fossils' history of being difficult to classify, there have been several attempts to enforce consistency in the naming of ichnotaxa. In 1961, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that most trace fossil taxa named after 1930 would be no longer available.

The party was founded as the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan on 29 April 2004. The Adilet numbered around 70,000 members. The party was built on a territorial basis and had branches in all regions of the countries and in the cities of Astana and Almaty. It was dissolved on 26 April 2013 after merging with Rukhaniyat Party to form Birik. History The party was founded on 29 April 2004 as the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan on the basis of the social and political movement \\"For Legal Kazakhstan\\", which functioned since the beginning of 2002. Maksut Narikbaev became the chairman of the party. At the 2004 Kazakh legislative election which took place on 19 September and 3 October 2004, the party won 0.8% of the popular vote and seat which was held by Zeinulla Alshimbaev from a single-member constituency. The party took part in the country's election commissions. In the 2005 presidential elections, 185 people were elected from the DPA to the election commissions. The Adilet was a part of the People's Coalition of Kazakhstan, which included pro-government political parties and a number of NGOs who supported President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his political and economic course. On 14 April 2006, at the 4th Congress of the Adilet, it was decided to rename the party to the Democratic Party Adilet and the post of the party chairman was turned into co-chairmen who were Narikbaev, Alshimbaev, Akhmedzhan, Ongarbaev, and Sydykhov. On 8 July 2007, at the 5th Congress of the Adilet, the party was merged with Ak Zhol Democratic Party. On 20 October 2007, at the 6th Extraordinary Congress of the Adilet, the merger of both parties became split.https://www.zakon.kz/95844-adilet-vykhodit-iz-partii-ak-zhol.html On 29 April 2008, at the building of the Gabit Musrepov Kazakh State Academic Theater for Children and Youth, the 7th Congress of the Adilet was held. Of the 245 elected delegates, 201 delegates took part in the work of the congress. Representatives of political parties, international, non- governmental organizations, mass media, well-known public and state figures, as well as a representative of the Russian political party A Just Russia, Alexander Romanovich were present at the congress as guests. On 24 April 2009, the party held a party conference dedicated to the 5th anniversary of its founding. At the 2012 legislative election, the party won 0.66% of vote and winning no seats. In a widespread statement, the Adilet congratulated all the winning parties, stressing that ‚Äúdespite the bleak election results for our party, we believe that the country won in general, Kazakhstan won‚Äù. In March 2012, the party's chairman Maksut Narikbaev voluntarily vacated the post, explaining this by the need to rejuvenate the party leadership.https://www.zakon.kz/4480262-maksut-narikbaev-ushel-s-posta.html In April 2012, at the congress of the party, Tolegen Sydykhov, who had previously been the first deputy chairman of the party, was chosen to succeed Narikbaev. On 26 April 2013, the Adilet and Rukhaniyat parties united into a new political party Birlik, as a result of which the Adilet ceased to exist.  Ideology  The party was founded with the aim of consolidating the civil will of the citizens of Kazakhstan by strengthening legal statehood, strengthening interethnic harmony and political stability in every possible way, and instilling true feelings of patriotism in Kazakhs. The party considered its main task to be the construction of a legal democratic social state in Kazakhstan, the creation of an effective, advanced and developed economic system, the formation of a civil society. The Adilet has constantly positioned itself as a party of the middle class and pro-business.  Structure  The supreme governing body of the Adilet was the Congress, which, according to the party's charter, was held once every four years. In practice, however, the Congresses were held more frequently. The congress has the authority to nominate its members to elected positions in government bodies, local self- government bodies and representative bodies of Kazakhstan; form the Central Committee of the party and its leader; elect party co-chairs; conduct a financial audit of the party's executive bodies; make decisions on the reorganization or liquidation of the party. The Central Committee of the party was engaged in the current organizational activities in the period between the work of the Congresses. The number and composition of this body is determined at the Party Congress. Meetings of the Central Committee are held at least once a year after it is convened by one of the party's co-chairs. The general leadership of the party between the sessions of the Central Committee of the party was carried out by the Political Council and the co-chairs of the party.

He served as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador and opposition leader from 1998 to 2001. When the Conservatives came to power in 2003, he was named Minister of Natural Resources and Government House Leader, being considered the second-most powerful politician in the province after Premier Danny Williams. Byrne was forced to step down from cabinet in 2006 after it was revealed that he and several other legislators had exceeded their constituency allowance claims, which led to a criminal investigation. He resigned from the Assembly at the end of that year. In 2009, he was convicted of defrauding the Crown of in excess of CAD$100,000 and influence peddling (known more formally in Newfoundland and Labrador as fraud against the government).  Early career and rise in politics  Byrne studied at Memorial University of Newfoundland where towards a joint Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Education program majoring conjointly in Newfoundland Studies and Religious Studies. In 1984, he was elected President of the University's Council of the Students‚Äô Union. He began his career as an adult educator specializing in curriculum development and serving as a skills training coordinator, and he went on to serve as Administrator of the Atlantic Labour Training Trust Fund. For five years, as well, he served as a management consultant. He wed the daughter of Gerry Ottenheimer, who was then serving as the Deputy-Speaker of the Senate of Canada. Subsequently, Byrne was elected to represent the district of Kilbride in the provincial elections of 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2003. As a Progressive Conservative Member of the House of Assembly, he served in several shadow portfolios including Post-secondary Education, Employment and Labour Relations, Environment, and Industry, Trade and Technology; and as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. He served as Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1998 to 2001. He stepped aside in 2001 to allow St. John's businessman Danny Williams to assume the leadership. Williams and the Progressive Conservatives then went on to win the 2003 provincial election. Byrne was appointed as the Minister of the Departments of Mines and Energy and Forest Resources and Agrifoods (now known collectively as the Department of Natural Resources) and Government House Leader on November 6, 2003 by Williams, positions he held until June 21, 2006.  Constituency allowance scandal  On June 21, 2006, Williams announced that he had requested Byrne's resignation as a result of an audit of the financial records of the House of Assembly by the Auditor General of the province. Byrne was forced to step down after the Auditor General expressed concern to the Speaker of the House of Assembly over financial issues. Byrne left cabinet that day. On June 22, 2006, the provincial Auditor General released a report on Byrne's constituency allowance claims in the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years. While Byrne had been eligible for a maximum claim of $31,500 for that period, the Auditor General had found evidence that he had claimed a total of $326,642 in excess of that amount. The Auditor General recommended that the case be turned over to the Department of Justice for review. The Auditor General also reported, on June 22, that three other members of the House of Assembly were being investigated for similar actions, one former Liberal member, one sitting Liberal member, and one sitting New Democratic Party member. The finance director of the Assembly, Bill Murray, was also suspended. As the scandal involved all political parties, the Conservatives did not suffer a backlash in the 2007 election and actually increased their share of the popular vote and seat count. On June 23, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary began a criminal investigation based on the findings of the Auditor General. Byrne, three other Newfoundland politicians and a senior civil servant in the House of Assembly were subsequently indicted under the Criminal Code of Canada, on fraud-related offenses. On November 28, 2006, Byrne announced his resignation from provincial politics, effective January 1, 2007. = Trial and conviction = Upon his arraignment in front of Provincial Court Associate Chief Judge D. Mark Pike, Byrne pleaded guilty to both criminal charges laid against him: fraud in excess of $5,000 and fraud against the government (influencing peddling). On April 17, 2009, Judge Pike sentenced Byrne to two-years-less-a- day on the count of fraud in excess of $5,000, and eighteen months on the count of fraud against the government, with both sentences being served concurrently. Byrne was further ordered to repay CAD$117,812 to the Crown. In his sentencing decision, the Judge noted that \\"The most aggravating factor to be considered is that this fraud and bribery was committed by someone who was in a high position of public trust. When officials enrich themselves or others in circumstances such as this, there is an undermining of the confidence in the democratic system ... Byrne used his position to carry out these fraudulent and corrupt activities.\\" The Judge noted two significant mitigating factors in his decision: first, that Byrne's marriage had broken down (and his family life dramatically affected); and, second, that having been convicted of an offense against Her Majesty, Byrne may never again be employed in or by the Public Sector (i.e., any government body under the authority of Her Majesty anywhere in Canada). The judge nonetheless largely agreed with the prosecution's request for two years imprisonment, citing the need to send a message of deterrence given the serious nature of Byrne's fraud. The judge rejected the defence's suggestion for a conditional sentence as too lenient, despite considering Byrne as not considered a danger to society if he was released due to his high-profile.  Arrest and sentencing for impaired driving  Byrne was arrested in April 2008, after he ran a red light while driving in St. John's. At the time of his arrest, Byrne's blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit. On April 28, 2009, Byrne pleaded guilty to a charge of failing a breathalyzer (a charge of impaired driving was dropped). His licence was suspended for 18 months, and he was fined $920. Byrne was incarcerated on fraud and corruption charges, at the time of the court hearing for impaired driving and was not present for the sentencing. Byrne had a prior conviction for impaired driving in 1991.

The deputy head mistress of the college, Sister Rachele Fassera of Italy, pursued the rebels and successfully negotiated the release of 109 of the girls. The Aboke abductions and Fassera's dramatic actions drew international attention, unprecedented at that time, to the insurgency in northern Uganda.  Background  Kole District is located just south of Acholiland, the region of Uganda most affected by the insurgency Following the rise to power in January 1986 of President Yoweri Museveni after the victory of his rebel National Resistance Army, the north of Uganda was wracked by conflict as first the rebel Uganda People's Democratic Army and then the chiliastic Holy Spirit Movement struggled against the new rulers. In January 1987, another rebel group, the LRA, was started by the spirit-medium Joseph Kony, eventually becoming the sole surviving rebel force. Despite attempts by the government to destroy or co-opt the LRA, it remained a weak but threatening force in the northern bush. In early 1994, the character of the LRA changed after it began to be supplied by the government of Sudan. The rebels began to target civilians, mutilating those they thought to be government sympathisers and abducting children as child soldiers and sex slaves. Most LRA activities at this time were concentrated within the three districts then comprising Acholiland: Gulu, Pader, and Kitgum. The violence, however, sometimes reached into Apac District, which bordered Gulu and Pader to the south. On 21 March 1989, the LRA carried out a raid on St. Mary's College, a Combonian school for girls mainly between the ages of 13 and 16. The rebels had abducted 10 schoolgirls and 33 seminarians and villagers, as well as killing others whom they had run across. In that incident, Fassera had tried to follow the rebels but had been forced to turn back after a battle erupted between the LRA force and a patrol of the government Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF). Nine of the ten girls eventually escaped, while one was killed in a battle several years later. As a result, a UPDF unit was assigned to protect the college.Brenna, pp. 10-12 By 1996, the security situation had again worsened. The soldiers of the UPDF had been replaced by Local Defense Unit militia. Rumors began to circulate through the countryside that the LRA was beginning to look at St. Mary's College as a likely target again. Nevertheless, in September 1996, the LDU militia stated that they must move from the college away to the town of Ikeme. Sister Alba, the mother superior, sent Sister Rachele to negotiate with the LDU commanding officer, who agreed to set up a night patrol if a pickup ferried the soldiers to the college at night and back to Ikeme at dawn.Brenna, pp. 2-3 The LRA almost always attacked at night, so this was a key breakthrough. Nineteen soldiers were assigned to the protection of the college, but Alba, feeling that the military presence was insufficient to stop an attack, sent Fassera by bike to ask for 50 soldiers, stating that she would otherwise close the school. Fassera did not have a way to transport the soldiers she was requesting, and the LDU officer calmed her by saying that he would send word if there was any danger.  Abductions  By 8:15 pm on 9 October 1996, Ugandan Independence Day, the expected soldiers had not yet arrived at the school. The three sisters held a meeting to decide on a plan of action. The option of moving the girls out of the school and dispersing them was discussed, but it was already dark and the possibility that LRA rebels would be waiting outside to attack deterred the sisters from this course. An hour later, the girls went to bed, although the mother superior stayed up until 11:30pm to pray in the chapel. At 2:30 am, the night watchman at the college knocked on Sister Fassera's door stating: \\"Sister, the rebels are here.\\"Brenna, pp. 3-4 Sister Fassera immediately woke Sister Alba and then moved out of the convent towards the front gate, which was actually a net, of the compound and spotted the rebels outside the gate. Thinking that the rebels had been slowed by the gate and that they may be able to evacuate the girls through the back gate, the nuns moved back towards the four dormitories, each of which had about 50 students. As they drew closer, however, they saw flashlights around the dormitories and realized that the LRA had already come through the back gate.Human Rights Watch 1997 In the knowledge that, if caught, the rebels would force them to open the doors, Sisters Alba and Fassera woke the one older nun, Sister Matilde, and together hid in the compound's stock house. Through the night, they heard the sounds of rebels moving through the compound but never the voice of any of the girls, giving them hope that the rebels had been kept out of the dorms by the iron reinforced doors and windows. Later estimates put the number of armed rebels at about 200. They burned the school vehicle, ransacked the clinic, and unsuccessfully attempted to burn several buildings. Pursuit Fassera immediately volunteered to go after the girls and Sr. Alba agreed. Fassera changed clothes and took some money from the office to buy the girls' freedom when two male teachers, Bosco and Tom, came in and volunteered to accompany her in the pursuit. Fassera agreed to take the younger of the two, Bosco, and was about to leave when she was stopped by a 13-year-old student who had been raped. Leaving the child with Sr. Alba, Sr. Rachele and Bosco left the college at about 7 a.m. The rebels had looted a large amount of candy and drinks that the college had bought for the Independence Day celebrations and the pursuers found that they could follow a trail of candy wrappers and drink bottles across the bush. They eventually came across a man who was fleeing the group of LRA, but who confirmed they had a group of girls with them. LRA bands were known to plant anti-personnel mines on their back trail to discourage pursuit and Bosco soon took the lead, telling Fassera to only step into his footprints. After wading through a swamp, Fassera and Bosco were joined by a woman whose daughter had also been abducted by the passing band. Soon after, as they came over a ridge, they saw the band on the ridge ahead. Coming through the valley, the three emerged from some dense brush to find themselves facing the leveled rifles of 30 rebels arrayed in two lines. Sister Rachele was depending on two factors: she was White and a nun. The former might lead the rebels to treat her with more caution than they would another Ugandan, while the second was a position of respect in a religious country when dealing with a group that was led by a mystic. Fassera had spent a year and a half in Gulu and knew enough of the Acholi language to begin speaking with the man who identified himself as the leader of the LRA band. The leader, Mariano Ocaya, stated that he did not want the money she had brought but, in response to her request that he release the girls, to her astonishment, replied \\"Do not worry. I will give you the girls.\\"Brenna, p. 6 The leader ordered the woman who had joined Bosco and Fassera to leave and the pursuers and the LRA rebels then continued up the ridge, Fassera stayed close to Ocaya in the knowledge that only he could release the girls. They caught up with the girls and continued walking with the rebels and their abductees, both the students and other abductees that the rebels had taken before the band made camp near the railroad at Acokara. Ocaya told Fassera to separate the St. Mary's College girls from the other captives and warned her against trying to add the other captives from her group. Fassera began to think that she would actually get all the girls back but at that moment a UPDF helicopter gunship passed overhead, forcing everyone to scatter and hide in the brush and Ocaya ordered everyone to move again. Crossing the railroad tracks, the group came under fire from UPDF soldiers and everyone scrambled for cover. For four hours, the group continued on a forced march, periodically hiding from the gunship searching the area, as a rearguard of rebels slowed the UPDF soldiers.New York Times 2005 The group, apparently losing the UPDF, arrived in a camp where there were still more abductees and the St. Mary's College girls were again separated from the others. One of Ocaya's \\"wives\\" took Fassera behind a hut to bathe and they had an argument when Fassera refused to change out of her habit into a dress. When she returned, Bosco whispered some of the girls were not being released. Fassera asked Ocaya if he was releasing the girls and he shook his head, wrote \\"139\\" in the dirt with a stick and said that he was releasing 109 and keeping 30, having selected them for desirable traits while Fassera was absent. When Fassera protested, Ocaya said that she could write a letter to Joseph Kony with the names of the girls and he might agree to release them. Taking a piece of paper, Fassera went back to the girls, she found that the 30 had already been separated. When she approached, the 30 began calling out to her to save them and, at an order from Ocaya, nearby soldiers began beating and kicking the girls. When they again fell silent, Ocaya again ordered Fassera to write down their names.Brenna, pp. 4-9 As she came close, the girls again asked her to help, telling her that they would be raped if they stayed until nightfall. Again, Fassera asked Ocaya to release the 30 as well, but he replied that either 30 would stay or all would. One of the girls named Angela offered to write the names, as Ocaya insisted that Fassera join him and the other LRA commanders for tea and cookies. When she returned, Angela whispered that a girl named Janet had slipped into the 109. Fassera knew that Ocaya was thoroughly capable of ordering all 139 to stay if he found Fassera trying to sneak one of the 30 out, so he went to Janet and told her that she was endangering the entire group. Janet apologized and rejoined the 30. After telling Judith, the head girl of the class, to look after the other 29, Fassera and Bosco took the 109 and eventually found their way back to the college. Aftermath Five of the thirty girls died in captivity and of the remainder, all but two eventually made their escape by 2006.Akallo Soon after the abduction, a girl named Jennifer went missing. When she was found hiding in a hut, the rebels dragged her into the open and ordered the others to beat her to death. The girls hit her lightly at first, but then the rebels surrounded the group and beat anyone who was not hitting Jennifer hard. Afterwards the LRA rebels left the corpse in the open and beat those who wept, both as an object lesson about attempting to escape and as a way to break the social ties between the girls. Of the fates of the thirty, the death of Judith, the head girl, is notable for its brutality. It is Sr. Rachele's belief that her request of Judith that she look after the others led her to do something that annoyed the rebels. One evening, Judith and another girl from the group of other captives, Caterina, had their hands bound behind their backs and were attacked with sticks, bicycle chains and machetes. Caterina died of her wounds the following morning, but Judith was still alive 24 hours later and asked for water. The rebels instead dragged her into the forest and tied her to a tree. A group of captives gathering firewood found her body a week later but the body had not started decomposing, indicating that she had not been dead for long.Brenna, p. 9 After a week of walking, the girls were brought north to Kony's base in Southern Sudan where they were given to various commanders as \\"wives\\". Sr. Rachele and the parents of the remaining abducted children formed the Concerned Parents Association (CPA) to raise awareness of the abductions and work for the children to be returned. In the course of their advocacy, the tale of the Aboke girls became one of the most widely known horror stories of the entire conflict. The CPA appealed to Pope John Paul II, who condemned the abductions, therefore drawing international attention to the incident and the situation in northern Uganda in general. On 7 March 1997, President Museveni wrote to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan describing the plight of the Aboke girls. In June 1997, Sr. Rachele and members of the CPA met with LRA commanders in Juba, Sudan. After originally denying that they held the girls, they then said they would release them if the Ugandan military declared a ceasefire. The Ugandan government rejected the proposal and stated that they were not responsible for anything that may happen to the girls. One of the most active CPA members has been Angelina Atyam, mother of Aboke girl Charlotte. Sr. Rachele and Ms. Atyam have, between the two of them, met the UN Special representative for children and armed conflicts, Olara Otunnu, then-U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, Kofi Annan, Yoweri Museveni, the Pope, members of the European Parliament, former South African President Nelson Mandela, Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, as well as numerous diplomats of other nations. The leaders of the LRA were indicted in 2005 for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, although some have noted that the indictments complicated the sporadic attempts at negotiations. A 2006 study estimated that 66,000 children and youths had been abducted over the course of the 20-year conflict. On 14 March 2009, Catherine Ajok, the last of the abducted Aboke girls still held by the rebels, returned to Uganda. Ajok escaped during the Garamba offensive against the LRA, making her way to a UPDF base in Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. She returned with her 21-month-old baby, who she said was fathered by Joseph Kony.

One of the main villains in the book, she is an immensely powerful witch, her main goal being the destruction of the race she comes from, the magical creatures known as the Seerkind. Immacolata has also been turned into a comic character, after Weaveworld was adapted into a 1991 limited series by Epic Comics. Fictional character biography =Early life= Immacolata was a powerful witch, who was born as a member of the secret race of the Seerkind ‚Äì mystical beings whose magical abilities have made them the object of fear and hatred by humans. The powers and appearance of the Seerkind have led humans (\\"Cuckoos\\", as the Seerkind derogatorily call them) to portray these beings in myths and fables. Immacolata claimed that she was the only descendant of the first pure genealogical line of sorcerers, being a direct descendant of Lilith. While an embryo in her mother's uterus, Immacolata manifested her inherent evil for the first time, using the umbilical cords of her triplet sisters in order to strangle them. As a result, she was the only one of the triplets to be born alive. However, even though she murdered her sisters, the young Immacolata also bound them with a spell that forced both of them to constantly accompany her in the form of ghosts throughout her life and protect her. Indeed, the two sisters (the Hag and Magdalene) were forced to serve their sister as ectoplasms, although they were granted the promise that as soon as their assistance was no longer required in her ploys, she would instantly dismiss them to find death and eternal rest. Immacolata spent most of her childhood wandering around graveyards and having a morbid interest in death and pain. =Adulthood= As an adult, Immacolata longed for power and control over the magical world of the Fugue, the world of the Seerkind. She started gathering loyals, who worshipped her as a goddess and committed several horrific crimes in her name. Her attempts to take over the back-then disorganised Fugue bore no fruit. After many bloody encounters between Immacolata's devotees and her enemies, the witch was found guilty of her crimes and was sentenced to exile by her peers. She was then forced to abandon the Fugue and started wandering aimlessly to the human world (The Kingdom of Cuckoos) for many centuries (she did not age, thanks to the power of the menstruum). Even in the human world, Immacolata started gathering a secret circle of fanatics who worshipped her and called her by several aliases, such as Black Madonna, Lady of the Sighs and Mater Maleficorium (mother of evil). Eventually though, she grew bored and always felt, in sharp contrast to the Cuckoos, to be able to fit in human society one day. At some point in the late 20th century, she met the greedy human known as Shadwell. The two decided to cooperate in order to find the rug within which laid woven the world of the Fugue. Immacolata even gave Shadwell a suit by use of which he could mesmerise others and control their will. At the same time, she kept having visions of the Scourge, the destructive force that had once almost destroyed the Seerkind, which was now lost in profound slumber, though the possibility of its reawakening filled the Incantatrix with terror. Immacolata later battled Suzanna Parish, granddaughter of the last guardian of the rug, Mimi Laschenski, but quite unexpectedly, when Suzanna was struck by the menstruum, the ethereal liquid force Immacolata wielded, she acquired it herself. After obtaining the rug, Immacolata wanted to destroy it but Shadwell insisted on performing a secret auction for some interested billionaires. Eventually though, the world of the Fugue was unleashed. Amid the chaos, Immacolata and her sisters wandered in the world where the witch was attacked by one of the lions of Romo, a Seerkind man who happened to be Mimi's first man. Romo wanted to exact revenge from her and his lion gravely injured Immacolata and deformed her face, before she killed it. The Incantatrix escaped but later both of her sisters were \\"slain\\" and she herself was betrayed by Shadwell who abandoned her (after she seemingly went insane, following the death of the Hag). Immacolata, half-mad and in a pathetic condition, was captured by the Seerkind. After Suzanna accidentally met her again, she tried to remind Immacolata of her past. Her effort was met with success, as Immacolata regained sanity, killed everyone around her (save for Suzanna) and flew towards the Temple of Loom, the centre of the Fugue, with the purpose of killing Shadwell and thus contaminating the temple with blood so as to bring forth the destruction of the Fugue. Instead, it was her blood that was shed after she was mortally stabbed by Shadwell, an act which indeed unmade the Fugue. =Afterlife= After all three sisters had expired, they merged into a unified ghost being which haunted the Shrine of Mortalities, an underground crypt storing the bones of those Seerkind who were killed by the Scourge. These series of underground crypts were located in the catacombs of a small church, hidden away in London and dedicated to Saint Philomena and Saint Callixtus. The place used to be a favourite hideaway for Immacolata when she was alive and the priests of the church had formed a secret cult, with the purpose of worshipping her. At the time the Three Sisters started haunting the catacombs, the cult grew even more loyal, now dubbing Immacolata with the novel name Lady of the Night. Later, Suzanna went to the church to meet with the Three Sisters (Immacolata still being the dominant personality) who warned her of the upcoming threat of the Scourge. Eventually, Shadwell and the Scourge (who had possessed Hobart) invaded the church, with the purpose of burning it down, since it was renowned for being a sanctuary of magic. The Three Sisters mocked the two villains and apparently disintegrated forever, after Uriel (the Scourge) used its holy flames to incinerate the walls of the tomb. Immacolata's sexuality Immacolata is constructed by Barker as a woman who defies her sensuality and remains decidedly a virgin throughout her adult life. Clive Barker has remarked on her sexuality: \\"She's kind of sexy, yet dangerous at the same time. And yet a virgin, which makes her all the more sexier of course\\".The Official Clive Barker Resource - Revelations - Barker on Weaveworld Immacolata is seen rejecting the sexual advances of her accomplice, Shadwell, who is attracted to her. She appears to believe that her power somehow stems from her virginity - and thus sees the latter as a form of sacristy that preserves her status as a goddess-like being (thus enhancing an abstract association of her character with Virgin Mary, herself being called the Black Madonna). All three sisters possess unique aspects of sexuality: Immacolata is portrayed as a mysterious and attractive, young-looking woman who persists on sexual abstinence, the Hag is an old and infertile female entity and the Magdalene is sensual and hedonistic as well as a mother, birthing demonic creatures called by-blows created through the rape of human men and used for Immacolata's bidding. Powers and abilities Immacolata has the ability to manifest raptures: like most of the Seerkind, she is able to produce illusions that mentally influence its receivers. Her most distinguishing aspect is the fact that she wields the menstruum: a glaring and strangely \\"alive\\" force that enables her to fly, create a shield around her body, unleash potentially lethal beams and much more, as soon as she concentrates enough to fully manifest it. Immacolata mentions at one point that only women can wield the menstruum (as does Suzanna later) and also that this force has driven many women mad and/or suicidal. The term itself seems to come from the same word which denotes the initial flow of menstrual blood (thus reaffirming the association of this power with womanhood). She also possesses several spells as well as the ability of seeing visions and communicating telepathically with her sisters. She is also able to summon several abominations and half-aborted monsters and control them. Additionally, she can attempt to alter the nature of certain objects, thanks to the menstruum. Because of her magical abilities and the menstruum, she did not age (she remained biologically young, although she was already hundreds of years old). Thanks to her necromantic abilities (she can summon the phantasms whose souls she has collected, including her sisters') she also possibly became a ghost herself following her death, finally joining her sisters in the same plane. Reference to Cenobites At one point in the novel Weaveworld, Immacolata makes reference to the demons known as the Cenobites, although she calls them by the name \\"The Surgeons\\" in an apparently sarcastic reference to the mutilations they perform on their unfortunate victims as well as their own bodies. These fictional demons have made frequent appearances in Barker's works, most prominently in Hellraiser. Immacolata mentions that hundreds of years ago, a man (whom she calls \\"Domville\\") wanted to impress her and ultimately seduce her. The man aspired to be a necromancer and summoned the Surgeons. According to Immacolata, the Surgeons were summoned from a long-lost world and were quite displeased at Domville's invocation. They then proceeded to hunt him down all over London. Domville entered Immacolata's temple and begged her to make them stop. Immacolata declined, however, and the man was subjected to unspeakable torments until she spared him of his suffering in exchange for his soul, which came into her possession after he died. The ectoplasm remained horribly deformed ever since and under Immacolata's orders until she opted for using it in Weaveworld so as to slay some Seerkind.

In the story, she is Madame Giry's oldest daughter. Description In the novel she is described as having ‚Äúeyes black as sloes, hair black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor little bones\\". She is also, in the novel, portrayed as a child of around fifteen years old and adores having her own way and attention. Due to her mother's role as the keeper of Box Five, Meg occasionally acts as a source of information about the ghost to the other ballet girls. She is described by the author in the prologue as \\"the most charming star of our admirable corps de ballet.\\" In the Andrew Lloyd Webber adaptation, she is older and her personality is much sweeter, caring and innocent showing genuine concern for Christine's claim of an Angel of Music (really the Phantom) coaching her. Meg is more curvaceous and has blonde hair and blue eyes. Madame Giry is compelled to work for the Phantom because he left her a letter that told her that Meg (should she deserve it) would become Empress. Early in the novel, it is explained in the Prologue that Meg Giry, after the story's events, had indeed become the Baroness de Barbazac. In contrast to the musical version, in the novel, it is never mentioned that she is friends with Christine Daa√©, and the only reference she makes about Christine is when confronted with the news that Christine was singing in the opening Gala, she tells Count Phillipe de Chagny that it was impossible for her to have a \\"divine voice\\" let alone become a success, that \\"six months ago she sang like a rusty hinge\\". In Susan Kay's novel Phantom, she is mentioned briefly through Erik‚Äôs point of view as she is telling Christine of the Opera Ghost he listens to her story. > \\"Never you mind how I know I just do that‚Äôs all. We know a lot about the > Opera Ghost, Ma and I, but it isn‚Äôt safe to talk about it here. And you‚Äôd > better believe me for your own good- he doesn‚Äôt like people who don‚Äôt know > how to show a proper respect, and when he‚Äôs angry terrible things happen.\\" > \\"What sort of things?\\" I heard real alarm enter the other voice now. \\"Awful > things!\\" said Meg cheerfully, \\"truly awful. The floor in our dressing room > starts to run with blood...\\" Up in box five I blinked in surprised > amusement. That was a new one! Little Giry should be writing Gothic novels, > not prancing around the stage dressed as a water nymph! Musical In the musical Meg Giry is the one who suggests to the theatre managers to put Christine in the leading role of the opera Hannibal once leading lady Carlotta Giudicelli is spooked by the Phantom's threats. Her mother, Madame Giry agrees and supports the decision. Normally she and Christine would be part of the ballet ensemble led by Madame Giry. At the end of Christine's performance, Christine confides in Meg in the musical number \\"Angel of Music\\" that she has been coached by a mysterious tutor who is calling her to him. Meg dismisses her claims, but after Christine's disappearance, comes to believe in the Phantom's powers, in part due to her mother's experiences with the Phantom as a young man. At the end of the musical, Meg finds the Phantom's mask that he had used to cover his disfigured face resting on his chair in his abandoned underground lair. Meg has a larger role in the sequel musical, Love Never Dies, where she craves the Phantom's recognition of her talent.

Description This frog reaches about 45 mm in length. It is normally grey, olive, or brown with pale spots or mottling, normally slightly warty in appearance, and the flanks are grey. It is cream on the ventral surface. The back of the thighs are pale yellow a few darker spots. A faint stripe runs from the nostril to above the tympanum; this stripe is pale and thin in contrast to the closely related stony creek frog and Lesueur's frog, and can be used to distinguish between the species. The typanum is darker in colour. The armpit is also pale yellow. The toe discs are relatively well developed, but only of a moderate size. The toes are nearly fully webbed. Behaviour and ecology Oberon, are prime habitat of the Booroolong frog. This species was once abundant in streams above about 200 m, until drastic declines began to occur in the Northern Tablelands in northern New South Wales. Although some declines have occurred in the Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, they have not been so severe. Currently in the northern tablelands, it is only found in two streams near Tamworth, as well as near Glen Innes in a private dam. In the central tablelands, it is found along the Abercrombie River, the Turon River, and the Winburndale Creek catchment areas. In the southern tablelands, this species is still found along the Tumut River, Yarrangobilly River, and the upper Murray River catchment areas. It is present at one stream in Victoria. The introduction of fish, such as trout, and the chytrid fungus are believed to be the main causes for decline. This species is a stream- dwelling frog, occurring in rocky westerly flowing rivers and streams in highland areas. It is normally associated with open woodlands, but is also found in grassland and forest. Males make a quite \\"quirk...quirk...quirk\\" call from beside streams or on bedrock within streams from late winter through to summer. An average of about 1,300 eggs are laid in a single adherent clump, attached to or under rocks, within rock pools or in still sections of streams. Hatching occurs from four to seven days after laying. Tadpoles are brown with well-developed mouth parts, and reach a maximum of about 58 mm. Metamorphosis occurs during summer, and tadpole development takes an average of 75 days. Metamorphs from northern areas average about 15 mm, while those in the south measure about 22 mm. Metamorph frogs closely resemble the adult.

Immunities are of two types. The first is functional immunity, or immunity ratione materiae. This is an immunity granted to people who perform certain functions of state. The second is personal immunity, or immunity ratione personae. This is an immunity granted to certain officials because of the office they hold, rather than in relation to the act they have committed.  Functional immunity  Functional immunity arises from customary international law and treaty law and confers immunities on those performing acts of state (usually a foreign official). Any person who, in performing an act of state, commits a criminal offence is immune from prosecution. That is so even after the person ceases to perform acts of state. Thus, it is a type of immunity limited in the acts to which it attaches (acts of state) but ends only if the state itself ceases to exist. The immunity, though applied to the acts of individuals, is an attribute of a state, and it is based on the mutual respect of states for sovereign equality and state dignity. States thus have a significant interest in upholding the principle in international affairs: if a state's officials are to be tried at all for anything, it will be at home. State offices usually recognised as automatically attracting the immunity are the head of state or the head of government, senior cabinet members, ambassadors and the foreign and defence ministers. Many countries have embodied the immunities in domestic law. States regularly assert that every official acting in an official capacity is immune from prosecution by foreign authorities (for non-international crimes) under the doctrine of ratione materiae. Such officers are immune from prosecution for everything they do during their time in office. For example, an English court held that a warrant could not be issued for the arrest of Robert Mugabe on charges of international crimes on the basis that he was serving as head of state at the time that the proceedings were brought.Mugabe, reported at (2004) 53 ICLQ 789 Other examples are the attempts to prosecute Fidel Castro in Spain and Jiang Zemin in the US. However, once the accused leave their offices, they are immediately liable to be prosecuted for crimes committed before or after their term in office, or for crimes committed in a personal capacity whilst in office (subject to jurisdictional requirements and local law). It may be the case that functional immunity is itself being eroded. Recent developments in international law suggest that ratione materiae may remain available as a defence to prosecution for local or domestic crimes or civil liability, but it is not a defence to an international crime. (International crimes include crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide.) The indictment in 1998 in Spain (and subsequent arrest in the UK) of Chile's Pinochet was a landmark decision by European judges and the UK's House of Lords, which set aside functional as well as local immunities, by ruling that the crimes Pinochet was accused of fell within the scope of the United Nations Convention against Torture, being international crimes so heinous that they are: * subject to universal jurisdiction (i.e. he could validly be indicted in Spain, held in custody in the UK on foot of an international arrest warrant and then extradited to Spain for trial, for acts that were committed mainly in Chile on the nationals of several countries); * absolutely prohibited (there can be no exceptions whatever to the prohibitions); and * responsibility cannot be derogated (no excuses whatsoever or immunity under any circumstances). The principle of depriving immunity for international crimes was developed further in the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, particularly in the Karadzic, Milosevic, and Furundzija cases (but care should be taken when considering ICTY jurisprudence due to its ad-hoc nature). This was also the agreed position as between the parties in their pleadings in the International Court of Justice case concerning the arrest warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium). In 2004 the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone held that indicted Liberian president Charles Taylor could not invoke his head of state immunity to resist the charges against him, even though he was an incumbent head of state at the time of his indictment. However, this reasoning was based on the construction of the court's constituent statute, that dealt with the matter of indicting state officials. In any case, Taylor had ceased to be an incumbent head of state by the time of the court's decision so the arresting authorities would have been free to issue a fresh warrant had the initial warrant been overturned. Nevertheless, this decision may signal a changing direction in international law on this issue. It is worth noting that the decisions of the Spanish and UK courts in relation to Pinochet were based directly on existing domestic law, which had been enacted to embody the obligations of the treaty. Although a state party to the treaty, Chile itself had not enacted such laws, which define the specified international crimes as crimes falling within the domestic criminal code and making them subject to universal jurisdiction, and thus Chile could only prosecute on the basis of its existing criminal code ‚Äì murder, abduction, assault etc., but not genocide or torture. The reasons commonly given for why this immunity is not available as a defence to international crimes is straight forward: # that genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are not acts of state. Criminal acts of the type in question are committed by human actors, not states; and # we cannot allow the jus cogens nature of international crimes, i.e. the fact that they are non-derogable norms, to be eroded by immunities. However, the final judgment of the ICJ regarding immunity may have thrown the existence of such a rule limiting functional immunities into doubt. See in this respect the criticism of the ICJ's approach by Wouters, Cassese and Wirth among others, though some such as Bassiouni claim that the ICJ affirmed the existence of the rule. Regarding claims based on the idea that a senior state official committing International crimes can never be said to be acting officially, as Wouters notes: \\"This argument, however, is not waterproof since it ignores the sad reality that in most cases those crimes are precisely committed by or with the support of high-ranking officials as part of a state‚Äôs policy, and thus can fall within the scope of official acts.\\" Academic opinion on the matter is divided and indeed only the future development of International Customary law, possibly accelerated by states exercising universal jurisdiction over retired senior state officials, will be able to confirm whether state sovereignty has now yielded partially to internationally held human rights values. In November 2007, French prosecutors refused to press charges against former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for torture and other alleged crimes committed during the course of the US invasion of Iraq, on the grounds that heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers all enjoyed official immunity under customary international law, and they further claimed that the immunity exists after the official has left office. However, other jurists hold that heads of state and state officials still can be prosecuted by foreign courts after the end of their terms of office.  Personal immunity  Personal immunity arises from customary international law and confers immunity on people holding a particular office from the civil, criminal, and administrative jurisdiction. It is extended to diplomatic agents and their families posted abroad and is also valid for their transfer to or from that post, only for the country to which they are posted. Under personal immunity, private residence, papers, correspondence, and property of an official enjoying personal immunities are inviolable. According to Cassese (2005), personal immunities are extended to cover personal activities of an official, including immunity from arrest and detention (but the host state may declare the person persona non grata), immunity from criminal jurisdiction, immunity from the civil and administrative jurisdiction of the host state. No immunities hold for private immoveable property unless it is held on behalf of the sending state for the purposes of the mission, issues of succession, professional or commercial activity exercised outside of official functions, or the official has voluntarily submitted to the proceedings. Personal immunities cease with the cessation of the post. It is not for the official's personal benefit but is based on the need for states to function effectively and thus not be deprived of their most important officials.  Cases of overlap  When a person leaves office who is under a personal immunity and has committed a criminal act covered also by functional immunity, the personal immunity is removed, as usual. That is what happened in the Augusto Pinochet case before the House of Lords. Senator Pinochet was able to be extradited to face only charges not under functional immunity and meeting the separate tests for extradition, under English law.

Bass became an international table tennis player. His 2-sport athlete status came about because arthritis forced him to retire from baseball. His is the brother of NFL player Dick Bass. Baseball career Bass pitched in 65 games (34 starts) for the Kansas City Athletics, finishing with a 13-17 record and a 5.32 career ERA in his Major League career. In his rookie year with the Athletics he had 11 wins and 11 losses. Bass signed with the Athletics before the 1958 season and made his debut with the Pocatello A's. He worked his way to the major leagues, making his debut at age 22. As a hitter, he hit his lone major league home run in 1961. Bass pitched in one minor league game in 1965, a complete game victory, but his baseball career ended after that performance. Football career Bass played safety for the Denver Broncos in 1964 after arthritis cut short his 1964 baseball season. The Broncos were an American Football League team that went 2-11-1 that season, with Bass playing Defensive Back and wearing #46. From 1960-1969, his brother, Dick Bass, was a running back for the Los Angeles Rams. 2-Sport athlete Bass played football and baseball in college and joined the Denver Broncos after he was unable pitch effectively in 1964, due to arthritis.

The conjectures generalize the analytic class number formula expressing the leading coefficient of the Taylor series for the Dedekind zeta function of a number field as the product of a regulator related to S-units of the field and a rational number. When K/k is an abelian extension and the order of vanishing of the L-function at s = 0 is one, Stark gave a refinement of his conjecture, predicting the existence of certain S-units, called Stark units. and Cristian Dumitru Popescu gave extensions of this refined conjecture to higher orders of vanishing. Formulation The Stark conjectures, in the most general form, predict that the leading coefficient of an Artin L-function is the product of a type of regulator, the Stark regulator, with an algebraic number. When the extension is abelian and the order of vanishing of an L-function at s = 0 is one, Stark's refined conjecture predicts the existence of the Stark units, whose roots generate Kummer extensions of K that are abelian over the base field k (and not just abelian over K, as Kummer theory implies). As such, this refinement of his conjecture has theoretical implications for solving Hilbert's twelfth problem. Also, it is possible to compute Stark units in specific examples, allowing verification of the veracity of his refined conjecture as well as providing an important computational tool for generating abelian extensions of number fields. In fact, some standard algorithms for computing abelian extensions of number fields involve producing Stark units that generate the extensions (see below). Computation The first order zero conjectures are used in recent versions of the PARI/GP computer algebra system to compute Hilbert class fields of totally real number fields, and the conjectures provide one solution to Hilbert's twelfth problem, which challenged mathematicians to show how class fields may be constructed over any number field by the methods of complex analysis. Progress Stark's principal conjecture has been proven in various special cases, including the case where the character defining the L-function takes on only rational values. Except when the base field is the field of rational numbers or an imaginary quadratic field, the abelian Stark conjectures are still unproved in number fields, and more progress has been made in function fields of an algebraic variety. related Stark's conjectures to the noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes. This provides a conceptual framework for studying the conjectures, although at the moment it is unclear whether Manin's techniques will yield the actual proof.

Cherryh. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Legend Books in August 1993 in trade paperback, and the first United States edition was published by Ballantine Books under its Del Rey Books imprint in November 1993 in hardcover. It was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1994. Faery in Shadow is a sequel to Cherryh's novella \\"The Brothers\\", which was first published in her 1986 collection of short fiction, Visible Light, and is based in part on Celtic Mythology,Fancher 2004, p.36. featuring such creatures as the fay race of the S√≠dhe, including pooka. Its setting is suffused with magical forces and supernatural beings, marking it as an example of the high fantasy literary subgenre. Cherryh also borrows elements from Horror Fiction for the book. A major revision of Faery in Shadow entitled Faery Moon, with a new copyright, was self-published by Cherryh as an e-book in December 2009. The realm of Faery C. J. Cherryh's Faery is an alternate plane of existence where the Sidhe live, separate from, but still connected to, the mortal realm of humans. Long ago the Sidhe lived alongside man, tolerant of his indiscretions, but with time, as man's abuse of Nature increased and his respect for the Sidhe diminished, the Sidhe began withdrawing to Faery. The Sidhe are generally free to \\"step\\" in and out of Faery at will, but only a select few mortals have that privilege (or misfortune), and then normally under the control of a fay. The Sidhe work with silver, but abhor iron. Broadly there are two types of Sidhe, the \\"bright\\" Sidhe, which include the Fair Folk, or Daoine, and the \\"dark\\" Sidhe, including pooka and others. The dark Sidhe are often old creatures that have been corrupted by evil and then won back by the bright Sidhe, and are normally bound to the bright ones by bargains and geas. Contrary to the popular notion that all fairies are good, the Sidhe are \\"practical\\" and will do whatever is necessary to achieve their goals, even at the expense of mortals. They speak in riddles and are forever striking bargains, which they stick to, to the letter. The dark Sidhe in particular are mischievous and enjoy playing tricks on humans. When it suits them, the Sidhe can take complete control of mortals. They can heal them, put them to sleep, touch their dreams and steal time from them. Plot summary Caith mac Sliabhin, condemned by the Sidhe in \\"The Brothers\\" for committing patricide, wanders along the river Guagach, accompanied and tormented by Dubhain, a mischievous pooka. Their journey takes them to Gleann Fiain where a beast from the river chases Caith up a hill to an isolated cottage. The occupants, twins Ceannann and Firinne, let Caith and Dubhain in and allow them to spend the night. Unbeknown to Caith, the birth of the twins 21 years ago set in motion a sequence of events that damned Gleann Fiain and cast a shadow over Faery. The twins were born to Fianna, queen of Gleann Fiain in Dun Glas. But unbeknown to her husband, Ceannann mac Ceannann, Fianna was unable to conceive and had sought help from a wise-women, Moragacht. Moragacht struck a bargain with her, promising her twins if she lay down with a selkie, in exchange for one of the twins when they were born. But when the twins arrived (a human and a selkie) and Moragacht came to claim one of them, Fianna denied any knowledge of her, and mac Ceannann turned Moragacht away. From that day onwards, grief and misery struck the family, and mac Ceannann and Fianna were forced to vacate Dun Glas and flee with the twins to an abandoned hilltop fortress. But the loch beast, under Moragacht's control, found them there and killed them all, except the twins, now aged 14, who escaped to the cottage. The witch then seized control of Dun Glas from where she damned all of Gleann Fiain. But the wards that had protected the cottage from Moragacht fall when Caith and Dubhain arrive. Riders from Dun Glas come and capture the twins. Caith and Dubhain (as a horse) give chase, but as they approach the riders, Dubhain is overcome by the witch's magic and falls into the loch, abandoning Caith. Caith and the twins are taken to Dun Glas where they are locked in cells bordering the loch. Caith lapses into a dream where he enters the loch to find Dubhain duelling with the loch beast. He draws Dubhain back to his cell, who in turn calls Nuallan from Faery, the bright Sidhe controlling their destinies. Nuallan gives Caith a silver key to unlock the iron cells and so lifts a spell enabling Nuallan to cast Caith, Dubhain and the twins out of Dun Glas. Moragacht allows her prisoners to escape because with her magic she now holds Nuallan, a bigger catch and her means to controlling Faery. The twins lead Caith and Dubhain to the ruins of the hilltop fortress, their former home. There they make a fire with the remains of a staircase, but a ghost appears out of the smoke that transports Caith back to the night of the fall of the fortress and into the body of Padraic, head of mac Ceannann's household. There he relives the last few hours of the family until he is killed by the beast. Firinne retrieves one of the burning timbers from the fire as a keepsake, and the twins set off for the sea to search for their selkie father, with Caith and Dubhain in pursuit. Caith finds the selkie first, a whale floundering on the beach. But when the selkie shapeshifts to a man, he is killed by one of Moragacht's pursuing riders. In the ensuing confusion, Caith accidentally kills Ceannann. Firinne is devastated by the loss of her twin brother and gives Caith her keepsake from the fortress. Then, revealing her selkie birth, she changes into a whale and heads out to sea. Caith rides Dubhain back to Dun Glas to free Nuallan. Once again Dubhain is weakened by the witch's spells and Caith has to enter the keep on his own. He sees Nuallan helpless in his cell, but Nuallan asks him to unlock it with the silver key Caith unknowingly still had all this time, the key that would have given Moragacht access to Faery. Nuallan takes the key and flees the keep, leaving Caith to fend for himself. Moragacht, furious at the loss of the Sidhe, prepares to deal with Caith, but he throws the charred piece of wood Firinne gave him into the fireplace which releases Padraic, the ghost from the hilltop fortress. In an act of revenge, it begins destroying Dun Glas and all in it. With the witch's spell now diminishing, Dubhain rescues Caith from the keep, while in the loch a whale from the sea turns on the beast. The shadow over Faery lifts and Caith and Dubhain resume their travels.

Caith is bound by geas to the Sidhe for committing patricide and is obliged to serve them. Dubhain, already serving the bright Sidhe, is also bound to Caith by geas because of his own past indiscretions. Thus Caith and Dubhain, like inseparable twins, have their destinies ruled by the bright Sidhe. Geassi binds the draiocht of the worlds and the bright Sidhe keep the draiocht in balance. But Moragacht the witch defies the Sidhe by waking the ancient earth gods and practising stone magic, which disturbs Faery and its delicate balances. But to work magic requires giving something to the powers from where the magic comes, and the greater the magic, the greater the gift must be. Moragacht draws her magic from the earth powers, the banished gods, but her real desire is to control Faery, and Nuallan is her gift in exchange for this sorcery. However, the exchange cannot happen until Nuallan consents, until he accepts and worships the stone gods. Moragacht wears Nuallan down with her dark magic, but Caith and Dubhain rescue him, each for their own reasons and in spite of the grief he has caused them. Caith recognises and is frightened by these old and hungry gods the witch is courting, and Dubhain, a dark creature himself, feels the temptation of these dark powers trying to claim him back. Faery Moon In May 2009, Cherryh announced that she was revising large parts of Faery in Shadow for e-book publication. As the work would be considerably altered, it was given a new title and a new copyright was obtained. In December 2009 Cherryh self- published the revised work in an e-book volume entitled Faery Moon, which included a minor revision of Faery in Shadow prequel, \\"The Brothers\\", an afterword by Jane Fancher, a Faery lexicon and other notes. =Background= Cherryh was never happy with the way Faery in Shadow was published.Cherryh 2009, \\"The Making of Faery Moon\\". She had originally entitled it Caith, and while still in rough draft, her editor at the time, Lester del Rey died, throwing Del Rey Books into crisis. Under pressure to publish Cherryh's book, the new editors requested a copy of her draft, which she reluctantly gave them. They were not happy with it, calling it too \\"dark\\". Then a lightning strike at Cherryh's house corrupted the original copy of the draft on her computer, and before she had a chance to rebuild the damaged file, Del Rey decided to take the book to print. They did their own copyediting and changed the title. Delays in the United States resulted in the first edition of Faery in Shadow being published in the United Kingdom, while the distribution of the book in America, according to Cherryh, was \\"abysmal\\". When Cherryh recovered the rights to Faery in Shadow, she decided to rewrite it the way she had originally intended it to be. She made use of both the published version of the story and her draft before the editors had started making changes. While she left the plot and characters of Faery in Shadow unchanged, Cherryh rewrote large sections of the prose and infused Caith and Dubhain's speech with a Celtic dialect.

It was the second novel featuring Hamilton's ongoing protagonist, counter-agent and assassin Matt Helm. In this book Hamilton continued the hard-headed and gritty realism he had built up around Helm in the first novel of the series, Death of a Citizen. Film adaptation The Wrecking Crew was loosely adapted in 1969 as a motion picture starring Dean Martin as Matt Helm.

The park is bordered to the east by Douglaston, to the west by Bayside, to the north by Little Neck Bay, and to the south by Union Turnpike. Cross Island Parkway travels north-south through the park, while the Long Island Expressway and Grand Central Parkway travel east-west through the park. The park primarily consists of woodlands south of the Long Island Expressway and meadowlands north of the expressway. It is run and operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Alley Pond Park was mostly acquired and cleared by the city in 1929, as authorized by a resolution of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1927. The park contains the Queens Giant, a tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) that is the tallest carefully measured tree in New York City and possibly the oldest living thing in the New York metropolitan area. The Alley Pond Environmental Center, with a library, museum and animal exhibits, is located in the northern part of the park, on the south side of Northern Boulevard.  History  = Site = What is now Alley Pond Park was once home to the Matinecock Native Americans, who harvested shellfish from Little Neck Bay. The English began to colonize the area by the 1630s, when Charles I granted Thomas Foster , on which he built a stone cottage near what is now Northern Boulevard. Mills were built on Alley Creek by Englishmen Thomas Hicks and James Hedges. The valley also contained the region's first mail route, established in 1764. Colonists also used the valley as a route to Brooklyn, the Hempstead Plains and the Manhattan ferries, and U.S. president George Washington is thought to have used this route for his 1790 tour of Long Island. The valley's usage as a passage, or perhaps its shape, may ultimately account for its name; in any case, an 18th-century commercial and manufacturing center there became known as \\"the Alley\\". In 1828, the Burhman general store was opened, becoming the only store in the area. On the west side of the valley, William Douglas (the namesake of the Douglaston neighborhood on the east side) bought around Oakland Lake in 1827. The lake itself was named after another estate, Frederick N. Lawrence's \\"The Oaks\\": that estate was named because of the many oak trees nearby, and was the namesake of the Oakland Gardens neighborhood on the valley's west side. In 1896‚Äì1897, the Oaks became the Oakland Golf Club. The lake itself was used as a water source by the town of Flushing from the 19th century through the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898, when the city built a water pumping plant on the lake; by the early 20th century, the city took its water from upstate reservoirs. Despite the valley's commercial center and light industrial uses that dated back to Hicks' and Hedges' mills, the area remained agricultural and largely unspoiled into the 20th century. In 1908, as motorists sought attractive areas for expeditions, William Kissam Vanderbilt built his privately run Long Island Motor Parkway through the area. = Founding and early history = By the 1920s, with open space becoming less plentiful, the City of New York began setting aside land for parks. Queens borough president Maurice E. Connolly wrote a letter to the city in 1927, suggesting that the tributary of the Little Neck Bay south of Northern Boulevard could be acquired for one such park called Alley Park. His successor Bernard M. Patten also supported the purchase of the land, and Douglaston civics groups argued in favor of the park. After the New York City Board of Estimate passed a resolution in 1927 to allow the acquisition of parkland, the city acquired the Alley site for such purposes on June 24, 1929. Later that year, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) expanded the park into a landscape surrounding the Alley and removed some older structures, including the Burhman store. After this acquisition had been approved, Mayor James J. Walker declared that \\"there is no better site in Queens\\" for a park. NYC Parks acquired Oakland Lake for Alley Pond Park in 1934. NYC Parks then began work on converting the park for public use. The northern section of the land became a nature preserve. In the southern section, a field house and numerous sports fields for soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey were built. These sections officially opened in 1935 with a ceremony attended by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. At opening, the park had of new playing fields; the Alley Pond Park Nature Trail, the first of its kind in the city; a bird sanctuary; bridle paths; tennis court; picnic areas; and a 200-space parking lot. NYC Parks added a bicycle path in the 1930s, having acquired and converted Vanderbilt's parkway. It runs west into Cunningham Park as part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway from Bayside to Prospect Park and Coney Island. The path opened in 1938. Part of the southern section of Alley Pond Park was renovated into a nature trail and reopened in 1940. = Recreation and pollution = After the 1930s, NYC Parks had focused more on recreation in Alley Pond Park than on the park's conservation. NYC Parks filled in much of the valley's marshlands to construct recreational facilities and roads, namely the Cross Island Parkway and Long Island Expressway. The construction of the Cross Island Parkway resulted in the park's namesake pond being reduced in size. By 1954, when the Long Island Expressway was built, Alley Pond was infilled to create the interchange between the two highways; the expressway opened in 1957 The center portion of the park, surrounding Alley Creek, was not developed through the mid-20th century and was considered an \\"eyesore\\". A 1959 proposal to add along the bay to Alley Pond Park was controversial among Douglaston landowners, who wanted the land to be used for a commercial amusement center. The related legislation was rejected almost unanimously by the New York City Council, with only the two representatives of borough president John T. Clancy voting in favor of the expansion. The Oakland Golf Club disbanded in 1952 but served as a city-operated course until 1961, after which it was developed into the Queensborough Community College, Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, and tract housing. This contributed to pollution in the Oakland Lake section of Alley Pond Park. In 1969, mayor John Lindsay broke ground on the renovation of the badly deteriorated Alley Park Extension at the north end of the park. Ford Motor Company bought a lot on the northern side of Northern Boulevard in 1968, intending to build an automotive showroom there, but the company's plan was controversial, and was rejected by the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals. Another lawsuit was filed in 1977 to prevent the construction of a tennis spa next to Alley Pond Park, which the plaintiffs argued would cause pollution in the park, though the spa owners won the lawsuit. = Conservation = Boardwalk across a stream leading from Oakland Lake to Alley Creek By the 1960s, civic groups were advocating for Alley Pond Park's restoration. Two thousand people participated in the first \\"Walk in the Alley\\" in 1969, led by Queensborough Community College dean John O. Riedl. Local groups also argued for the preservation of Alley Pond and Cunningham Parks. The city's park system was in various states of disrepair by the 1970s, with a maintenance building at Alley Pond Park having burned down. NYC Parks also cut staffing at numerous parks: though Alley Pond Park was maintained by 17 workers in 1970, that number decreased to 11 in 1972. The agency commenced the Wetlands Reclamation Project in 1974 to rehabilitate the park's natural wetlands. NYC Parks also dredged the creek, leveled surrounding areas to eliminate standing water, cleaning three freshwater springs and two freshwater ponds, landscaping paths and trails, and building sound-reducing berms on Northern Boulevard. In addition, some of the park's tennis courts were renovated. The Alley Pond Environmental Center (APEC), founded in 1972, moved to its own building on Northern Boulevard four years later. The city also acquired over $10.9 million worth of land for the park. An 1870s-era windmill away at Arleigh Road, on the Douglaston peninsula, was relocated to the park when the windmill's original site was threatened with development, and was intended to be used as an APEC exhibit; however, the windmill was burned in an arson two years later. APEC volunteers raised money to build a replica, which was completed in 2005. On the other side of the park, Gertrude Waldeyer led an advocacy group to preserve Oakland Lake, leading NYC Parks to spend $1 million restoring the lake in 1987, with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation designating the surrounding area as freshwater wetlands the next year. In 1993, almost $1 million was spent to restore the Picnic Grove, renovate two stone buildings, and reconstruct the playground and soccer field. By the mid-1990s, development around Alley Pond Park had led to pollution, including in Oakland Lake in the western section of the park. This led local groups to propose that the city hire an administrator to run numerous parks in eastern Queens, including Alley Pond Park, Crocheron Park, Cunningham Park, Douglaston Park, Fort Totten, and Udalls Cove. A proposal to renovate the interchange between the Cross Island Parkway and Long Island Expressway was announced in 1995, leading conservationists to raise concerns over the potential removal of trees. The interchange plan was approved in 2000. With the renovation of the interchange, of the interchange were reclaimed for park usage, and Alley Pond was restored. The project was completed in 2005. The area around Oakland Lake was restored again in 2011. The Alley Pond Environmental Center relocated to a temporary location at 224‚Äì75 76th Avenue in Oakland Gardens in 2019, after a two-year-long renovation of its Northern Boulevard headquarters had begun that September.  Geography  At , Alley Pond Park is the second-largest public park in Queens behind Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, and the ninth-largest public park in the city. It occupies part of a terminal moraine, a ridge of sand and rock, that was formed by a glacier 15,000 years ago, at the southern terminus of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Boulders dropped by the glaciers on the hillsides of the southern end of the park still remain, as do scattered kettle ponds formed by melting ice. The valley features both fresh water, draining into the valley from the hills and bubbling up from natural springs, and salt water from Little Neck Bay. This promotes ecodiversity, with freshwater and saltwater wetlands, tidal flats, meadows, and forests accommodating abundant bird life. Much of the park is part of the Alley Pond nature preserve. = Waterways =  Alley Creek  Alley Creek, shown here at high tide, flows into Little Neck Bay, bridged by the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch. Alley Creek flows northward through the valley within which the park is located, emptying into Little Neck Bay. Alley Creek is surrounded by some of the last remaining old-growth forest in Queens. The creek is crossed by a masonry-and-metal span carrying Northern Boulevard and a viaduct carrying the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch. A stream from Oakland Lake, which was buried after the Cross Island Parkway was built, is a left-bank tributary of Alley Creek.  Ponds  In addition to Alley Creek, there are seven ponds in Alley Pond Park, all of which are kettle ponds. These ponds are Alley Pond, Cattail Pond, Lily Pad Pond, Little Alley Pond, Muskrat Pond, Turtle Pond, and Windmill Pond. Little Alley Pond is located near the Grand Central Parkway and is the southernmost pond in the park. Turtle, Lily Pad, and Decodon Ponds are located slightly to the north; the latter two are shallow wetland ponds. Alley Pond, located at the southwest corner of the Cross Island Parkway and Long Island Expressway interchange, was historically a rest stop on West Alley Road and contained gristmills and the Burhman general store. Windmill Pond, near the Alley Pond Environmental Center at Northern Boulevard, is powered by a windmill. Cattail Pond, also near the APEC building, is at the lowest point of a cattail marsh that includes Marsh St. John‚Äôs wort and swamp milkweed as well as water plantain and arrow arum.  Oakland Lake  The westernmost part of the park, south of 48th Avenue between Springfield Boulevard to the west and Cloverdale Boulevard to the east, includes Oakland Lake, a larger kettle pond on the grounds of the former Oakland Golf Club (now the Queensborough Community College campus). It is fed by natural springs, and prior to the development of eastern Queens, was fed by a stream extending from the modern intersection of Horace Harding Expressway and 223rd Place. Numerous species of bass, pickerel, and sunfish can be found in the lake, and fishing is allowed. An urban legend speculated that the lake was deep with an underwater spring flowing to Little Neck Bay, but a 1969 study of the lake found it was only deep. Oakland Lake was officially used as a water source from the mid-19th century likely into the 1950s. The brook leading to the lake was channelized and later infilled in the 1930s, and the wetlands were partially infilled in 1941. After deterioration in the late 20th century due to increasing urbanization, it was restored in 1987 and 2011. A boardwalk circling Oakland Lake is named after Gertrude Waldeyer, who led the 1980s preservation campaign for the lake. The area surrounding Oakland Lake also contains Queens' first \\"bluebelt\\" system, created in 2011, in which runoff flows through natural-looking landscapes rather than through storm sewers. = Wetlands and meadows = The northern end of Alley Pond Park includes of freshwater and saltwater wetlands. Freshwater from further inland mixes with the saltwater from Little Neck Bay. These wetlands host a complex ecosystem with numerous bird and fish species. The John Riedl Wildflower Meadow, named after the Queensborough Community College dean, is located on both sides of Northern Boulevard. It was named in Riedl's honor in 1994 and contains ox-eyed daisies, grey birch, and pitch pine.  Features  = Recreation = Alley Pond Park contains numerous sports fields. The northern section of the park near Cloverdale Boulevard and Horatio Parkway contains Horatio Playground as well as a baseball field, a basketball court, and two handball courts. The central section, at 67th Avenue between 230th and 233th Streets, contains Alley Playground as well as a baseball field, a basketball court, and four handball courts. Springfield Boulevard between 73rd and 76th Avenues, at Alley Pond Park's southwestern corner, has five baseball fields and a soccer field, as well as restrooms and a picnic area. The area northwest of the intersection between the Cross Island and Grand Central Parkways contains a barbecue area, a picnic area, a football field, two baseball fields, four handball fields, and Alley Springfield Playground. South of the Grand Central Parkway is the Alley Athletic Playground, with five baseball fields, a cricket/football field, a soccer field, a handball court, numerous batting cages, and a playground. Alley Pond Park also has numerous hiking and walking trails. There are six named trails, which range from . These are the Red, Orange, Blue, White, Yellow, and Tulip Tree trails; all except the Yellow and Tulip Tree trails are on the southern side of the park, south of the Long Island Expressway. = Alley Pond Environmental Center = The \\"Queens Giant\\" measures tall. The Alley Pond Environmental Center (APEC) was founded in 1972 by Joan and Hy Rosner as a grassroots organization that advocated for the park. The APEC building, on the south side of Northern Boulevard, was announced in 1975 as part of a series of improvements across Queens. The building opened in 1976 and contains a library, museum and animal exhibits. By 2011, it had eight staff members and 1,000 volunteers, and its programs had served over 62,000 students. = Alley Pond Adventure Course = The Alley Pond Adventure Course is located at the southern end of the park. Opened in 2007, the course contains a climbing wall, a ropes course, a trust fall area, a zip line, swings, and balance platforms. The ropes courses extend up to above ground. = Alley Pond Golf Center = The Alley Pond Golf Center is located east of the Northern Boulevard bridge over Alley Creek. The golf center has operated since the 1950s and has 70 stalls. The golf center is especially popular among the Korean-American population of the surrounding area, and signs at the complex are posted in both English and Korean. = Queens Giant = The Queens Giant (also known as the Alley Pond Giant or Alley Pond Park Giant), at , is an old tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) that is located in Alley Pond Park. It is the tallest carefully measured tree in New York City, measuring tall with a circumference , and it might also be the oldest living thing in the New York metropolitan area, being between 350 and 450 years old in 2005. A tree in Staten Island, known as the Clove Lake Colossus, has a more massive trunk, but it is only tall. However, NYC Parks is unsure of the margin of error regarding the Queens Giant's age, and its true age may have a margin of error of several decades or centuries. Some arborists estimate the tree's age at 250 years, making it younger than other trees in the city. The nearby Great White Oak in Douglaston, though smaller, may have been about 600 years old when it was cut down in 2009, though that tree's age is also disputed. The Queens Giant is hidden within a grove, barely visible from the westbound Long Island Expressway. The tree is near the Douglaston Plaza Mall, and is accessible by foot from Alley Pond Park. There are no signs to it, but it can be viewed in an Urban Park Ranger tour. The Queens Giant is surrounded by a metal fence on all sides to protect it, and a hill and a sign describing the tree stand in front of it.

It connects the banks of the river at Kerkstraat, between the Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht.Magere Brug (Skinny bridge) on I amsterdam The central section of the Magere Brug is a bascule bridge made of white-painted wood. The present bridge was built in 1934. The first bridge at this site was built in 1691 as Kerkstraatbrug and had 13 arches. Because this bridge was very narrow, the locals called it magere brug, which literally means \\"skinny bridge\\". In 1871 the state of the bridge had deteriorated so much, it was demolished and replaced by a nine-arched wooden bridge. Half a century later, this bridge also needed to be replaced. Architect Piet Kramer made several designs for a steel and stone bridge, but the city decided to replace it with a new bridge that looked the same as the previous, only slightly bigger. In 1934, that bridge was demolished, and replaced by a redesign made by Piet Kramer. The last major renovation was in 1969. Until 1994, the bridge was opened by hand, but is now operated automatically. Use of the bridge has been limited to pedestrians and cyclists since 2003. The centre-part is opened many times, daily, in order to let river traffic pass. The sightseeing tour boats are low enough to pass underneath the bridge when closed. The bridge is decorated with 1,200 light bulbs which are turned on in the evening. A story told to tourists about the origins of the 1691 version of the bridge is that it was built by two sisters who lived on opposite sides of the Amstel river and wanted to be able to visit one another, every day. In one variant of the story, the sisters were not able to afford a bridge of adequate width or height for general use, so a very narrow bridge was built, hence its name. In another variant, the sisters' last name was Mager (skinny), which gave name to the bridge (rather than its narrowness)Magere Brug page on amsterdam.info. Recent research of city archives revealed the name has its origin in the fact that originally a broad and monumental stone bridge was planned during Amsterdam's prosperous Golden Age, but the 1672 economic setback forced the city council to drastically scale back the plans, and build a basic and simple structure instead. De Grote Uitleg van Amsterdam (in Dutch), J.E.Abrahamse, Thoth 2nd print 2011. Locals regard the bridge as the most romantic of all in Amsterdam. It is a common site for proposals and lovers' strolls. Additionally, legend says that a kiss between lovers while on this bridge (or passing beneath by boat) ensures that they will be in love forever. The bridge can be seen in a number of films, including the 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever, in which the legend of the bridge's being built is told by a boat tour guide.

Sectaurs was created by Lawrence Mass, Tim Clarke and Maureen Trotto and licensed by Seven Towns. The premise was that \\"somewhere in space, somewhere in time,\\" exists a planet called Symbion, where a genetic experiment fails. Frightening changes take place that cannot be stopped. The result? A world where insects and arachnids grow to frightening proportions. A world where the inhabitants have taken on the awesome characteristics of insects and arachnids. Prince Dargon, ruler of the peaceful Shining Realm of Prosperon, and his allies are in conflict with the forces of Empress Devora, ruler of the Dark Domain of Synax, and her henchmen, for possession of the Hyves, fortresses of an ancient civilization holding the key to ultimate power. Each character was \\"tele-bonded\\" with intelligent, non-anthropomorphic insect creatures called Insectoids that had a special ability, and shared each other's \\"pleasure and pain.\\" An animated mini-series that spanned five episodes was created based on the characters, and Marvel Comics published an eight issue limited series about them as well. A read along record storybook was also made. Sectaurs action figures Sectaurs was released by Coleco in 1985 (not 1984, as the stamp on the figures would suggest). Figures and insect companions were packaged together in a window box with weapons, a mini comic book and instructions. Some of these companions were large enough for the Sectaurs to ride, and were actually \\"puppet like\\", in which you could place your hand inside a glove that made up the lower body of the beast to manipulate the legs and an action feature. A second series of figures were designed and pictured in dealers' catalogues, but never produced due to the line's cancellation. The toy line did not do well partly because of the intimidating appearances of even the heroes and their companion beasts, and partially due to price points well above other action figure lines in stores at the same time. =Heroic Sectaurs of the Shining Realm= *Dargon: Prince of the Shining Realm. He is bonded with a Flying Steed called Dragonflyer which has a biting action. His weapons included a broadskall sword, shield, twin venguns, and a slazor. Although Stellara is in love with Dargon, he secretly desires to marry Belana - the royal betrothed of his childhood friend Zak. An alternate figure was also released called Night Fighting Dargon, which had silver armor and antennae which glowed in the dark. Night Fighting Dargon included a skall dagger, a vengun, and trinoculars with \\"lenses\\" that glowed in the dark. The weapons were kept in ankle sheathes, rather than the starndard belt holsters, enabling all of Dargon's weapons to be worn by one figure. Another insectoid companion, Parafly, was sold with Night Fighting Dargon as well, an Action Bug that attached to his back and featured flapping wings and a tail that glowed in the dark. Parafly appeared in one issue of the Sectaurs comic book, where he was depicted as more intelligent than common animalistic insectoids, and he temporarily granted Dargon the power to see in the dark. Night Fighting Dargon was the only figure actually released from the planned second wave of toys shown in catalogues. *Pinsor: A veteran warrior who rides the massive Battle Beetle, a Steed with two heavy front arms that close with a pincering action. Pinsor's weapons included a skall battle axe, sword, shield, and a vengun. He suffered from unrequited love for Stellara, whose affections lay with Dargon. *Zak: Captain of Prosperon's Royal Guard, until his wisecracking insolence got him replaced. Zak's childhood friend is Dargon, who (secretly) doubles as his rival for Belana's affections. His companion, Bitaur, was an Action Bug with a biting action. Zak's weapons included a slazor, a vengun, and a skall shield. *Mantor/Mantys: A \\"Keeper of the Way,\\" a scholar of the ancient powers contained in the Hyves and the Ancients who created them. His companion beast is Raplor, an Action Bug with a grappling line that extends from its mouth and a winch action to rewind the cable. Mantor's weapons included a crossbow, vengun, and skall shield. Said to be an expert of the native Sectaurian martial-art of Kai. *Stellara: A female warrior. In the comic book series, it was established Stellara's Insectoid died in battle some time ago and one story focused on her attempting to tele- bond with a new one, but was unable to complete the ritual because Dargon and the others were in danger. Nevertheless, the Insectoid she tried to tele-bond with aided her in saving them. In the comics, Stellara was a romantic interest of Pinsor, but she thought of him as a surrogate father; her true fondness was for Dargon. The two renditions of Stellara, despite sharing a name, were very visually different from each other. The unreleased Stellara figure from the planned second series of the toyline resembled her animated incarnation, and was to have included Rhine-Ox as her partner, an Action Bug with a head-butt feature. Her weapons were a skall dagger, shield, and a vengun. *Bodyball: A character seen only in the unreleased second wave of the toyline. Rather than being paired with an Insectoid, Bodyball was one of two figures planned to have a special action designed into the figure itself. He could be folded up, much like a pillbug, and visually seemed to be a member of a race other than his Sectaur compatriots. Pictures of the figure showed oddly shaped claw and shield weapons as his accessories. *Crossbow: The Shining Realm's Battle Bug, and part of the unreleased second line. Its projectile was a missile-like pod referred to as a \\"spear\\" in catalogue and package text. *Gyrofly: The only Creeper that was planned to be released for the Shining Realm faction in the unreleased second line. It was a scarab-like device which opened its shell and released a spinning propeller projectile named Attack-Gnat. =Evil Sectaurs of the Dark Domain= *General Spidrax: Hideous leader of the Dark Domain's armies, armed with a whip coated in lethal poison. Unlike most Sectaurs, he enslaved his animal companion, Spider-Flyer, rather than form a bond with it. This was possibly because Spidrax had no forehead antennae (which all other Sectaurs possess) with which to initiate the tele-bonding process, but also to show his cruelty. Spidrax's weapons included a venom whip, slazor, skall shield, net, and twin venguns. Spider-Flyer was a Flying Steed with biting mandibles. Like Dargon, the second wave of toys was to have featured a Night Fighting Spidrax, which included a staff weapon, boomerang, and attachable armor which glowed in the dark. Night Fighting Spidrax would have been paired with an Action Bug named Stranglebug, which was a spider with unusually long bendable legs that could be wrapped around a figure. Unlike Night Fighting Dargon, however, Night Fighting Spidrax went unreleased with the rest of the second series. *Skulk: Empress Devora's hideous and opportunistic stepson, who rides the spider-like Trancula, an extremely furry Steed with biting mandibles. His weapons included a skall dagger, shield, vengun, and dart wing. *Commander Waspax: Spidrax's rival. His Insectoid companion is Wingid, an Action Bug with flapping wings. His weapons included a skall saber, shield, and vengun. *Skito: A mercenary. His companion, Toxcid, is an Action Bug that squirts water from his proboscis, said to be \\"poison\\" in the context of the stories. His weapons included a skall sword, shield, and vengun. *Bandor: One of the unreleased second wave figures. Bandor included a flail, skall sword, and shield. His insectoid was Swipe, which was an Action Bug with an extending proboscis weapon. *Knuckles: The other of the two figures in the second line which was to have had a built-in feature rather than an Insectoid. His feature was likely a punching action with his \\"Mutant Arm\\". Knuckle's accessories included some form of hand weapon, a shield, and two small skalibur guns which attached to the sides of his helmet and connected to his weapons belt by power cables. *Fly Flinger: The Dark Domain's Battle Bug, from the unreleased second series. Its projectile was a glider-like second smaller insect generically named Fly. *Snag: One of two Creepers planned to be released for the Dark Domain in the unreleased second wave of toys. Snag featured a short grappling line that fired from its mouth and could be rewound into its body. *Axe-Back: One of two Creepers planned to be released for the Dark Domain in the unreleased second wave of toys. Ax-Back featured a blade-like protrusion that snapped up from its back. =The Hyve= The Hyve playset was also produced, and is one of the larger playsets released in the 1980s. Accessories included a boulder-like wrecking ball, a heavy skalibur turret gun, a ladder, and a cage. It featured a landing pad with a trap door, a collapsible bridge, and an interior detailing a \\"Bio-Control Laboratory\\". The Hyve came with two Mutant Insectoids as guardians. Narr was a glove puppet, while Vypex was a smaller finger puppet. Narr and Vypex each had a cave from which they could \\"ambush\\" figures during play. Since each was a puppet, their rear anatomies did not exist in toy form. As a result, the penciler who worked on the comic book never drew the rear portions of their bodies. The rear edge of Narr's abdomen was always obscured by the foreground, while Vypex's serpentine body never ended. =Notable Characters From the Comics and Other Books= *Belana: Zak's royal betrothed, who secretly (and mutually) desires Dargon. *Devora: Goddess- empress of the Dark Domain and stepmother of Skulk. *Galken: Rules the Shining Realm as a Regency, in the absence of his elder brother Markor. A politician, not a warrior. Uncle of Dargon. *Gnatseye: A warrior of the Shining Realm telebonded to an Insectoid named Jumpyr. *Hardyn: Galken's chief adviser. *Markor the Mighty: King of the Shining Realm, father of Dargon. Disappeared years ago searching for the Hyves. *Scorpia: A villainous Keeper, and Spidrax's half-sister. *Seacor: A headstrong youth featured in the animated miniseries. He's eager to prove himself to Dargon and Company; Seacor's Insectoid companion is Altifly. *Slikk: This veteran thief is a loudmouthed troublemaker whose ribald jokes, outrageous lies, and embarrassing pranks make him less than popular with his fellow Sectaurs. Still, he's better company than the Dark Domain has to offer. =Glossary of Terminology and Locations= *Blue Forest: product of the Great Cataclysm, east of Synax. Common deportation ground for convicted criminals, since all those who journey through this zone are subject to complete and absolute amnesia. *Citadel of Shadows: the first Hyve-gate shown in the comics. It lies halfway between Prosperon and Synax, but was destroyed by Mantor shortly after its discovery. *Creepers: Smaller insects said to be bred as living weapons. They were to be released as \\"role-play\\" scale toys in the unproduced second line, and fit over a user's hand, not as a puppet, but supposedly as a life-sized weapon. Each possessed an action feature similar to the Action Bug Insectoids. *Dark Domain: a military dictatorship and homeland of the less humanistically appearing \\"evil\\" characters of the series. **Grimhold: dark fortress of Synax; residence of Empress Devora and family. **Synax: Capital of the Dark Domain. **The eleven ranks of the Dark Domain's feudal peerage, from lowest to highest, are: Sergeant, Warmaster, Ensign, Lieutenant; Captain; Major; Commander, Colonel; Brigadier; Field Marshal/General; Grand Marshal/Warlord. (The latter, as with the shoguns of Japan, acts as the Emperor's deputy- ruler.) *Dart Wing: a spear of wing-buoyed skall guided as a weapon via telebond with its wielder. Each wing is razor-sharp and can cut like a sword. *Desert of the Lost: product of the Great Cataclysm; lies southeast of Prosperon and southwest of Synax, due south of Mount Symbion. Common deportation ground for convicted criminals, since all those who journey through this zone are subject to near-suicidal depression. *Forbidden Zone: basically, an unknown area outside the hexagon boundaries that enclose all of known Symbion. *The Great Cataclysm: result of a failed genetic experiment, which ruined the Civilization of the Ancients on Symbion. Insects and arachnids grew to frightening proportions; Humans took on the characteristics of arachnids and insects, with the Sectaurs as the results. *Hyve: A mysterious, danger-filled fortress of the Ancients. Filled with guardian monsters and booby-traps, its wisdom is sought by good and evil Sectaurs alike. There are multiple gateways, or entrances, to the Hyve across Symbion; at least two exist within the hexagonal boundaries of the known world, and others are believed to exist in the Forbidden Zone beyond. The Hyve resembling the playset from the toyline - and guarded by Naurr and Vypex - is the second gateway visited in the comic series. *Insectoids: giant, mutated insects and arachnids that cohabit Symbion with the Sectaurs. They frequently serve as allies, pets and/or steeds of the Sectaurs. Various similar types include Steeds, Flying Steeds, Action Bugs, Battle Bugs, and Mutants. **Action Bugs: A term used in the toyline to denote the smaller partner Insectoids, which each possess a single button or crank activated feature. (Parafly has two special features, though one is simply parts that glow in the dark.) **Battle Bugs: A form of Insectoid that is low-slung and carries an artillery weapon atop itself with a seat for a Sectaur rider. One Battle Bug was to be released for each faction in the unproduced second wave of the toyline, both with identically shaped bodies, but with different spring-fired projectile weaponry mounted atop them. **Flying Steeds: winged Insectoids large enough to be ridden by their Sectaur partners. In the toyline, Steeds are half-puppet figures, with a user's hand fitting into the legs of the toy and the middle finger operating some additional action feature. Additionally, they have flapping wings driven by a battery-powered motor. **Mutants: eternally-living insectoids created by the Ancients as guardians for the lost Hyve. **Steeds: Insectoids large enough to be ridden by their Sectaur partners. In the toyline, Steeds are half-puppet figures, with a user's hand fitting into the legs of the toy and the middle finger operating some additional action feature. *Lake of Blood: northeast of Prosperon and northwest of Synax. So- named because of a great air/sea battle fought there by the great-grandparents of King Markor and Empress Devora. Said battle cost nearly a million lives. *Meander: Also known as the Fog of Death, a product of the Great Cataclysm. A permanent valley of Meander was located southeast of Prosperon and southwest of Synax (beyond the Desert of the Lost) at the beginning of the comic series, protecting and hiding the second gateway to the Hyve, until it was dispersed using the power of the Hyve. A Meander was also seen early in the comic, accidentally released from the Hyve-gate known as the Citadel of Shadows. Breathing this crimson fog results in prompt and violent corrosion of the internal organs, for all those foolhardy enough to expose themselves. *Mount Symbion: highest elevation in known Symbion; . Located southeast of Prosperon and southwest of Synax, due north of the Desert of the Lost. *Sea of Acid: product of the Great Cataclysm, located west of Prosperon. Will promptly and violently corrode the flesh of all those foolhardy enough to swim in it. *Sectaurs: insect-evolved humanoid denizens of both Prosperon and Synax. They and the insectoids comprise, for the most part, the remnants of Symbionic civilization. *Shining Realm: a constitutional monarchy, and the homeland of the more humanistically appearing \\"good\\" characters of the series. **Lightkeep: shining castle of Prosperon; residence of the Royal Family. **Prosperon: Capital of the Shining Realm; **Symator: legendary double-edged \\"broadskall\\" [broadsword] of Prosperon, passed down from ruler to ruler for the past 20 generations. Dargon is its most recent owner. **The eleven ranks of the Shining Realm's feudal peerage, from lowest to highest, are: Esquire; Paladin; Baron/Baroness; Count/Countess; Marquesire/Marchioness; Duke/Duchess; Archon/Archonette; Magnusate/Magnusetta; Viceroy/Viceregine; Prince/ss Royal; Crown Prince/ss. *Skalibur: a bio-energy beam weapon of lost Ancient technology. Skalibur weapons are often found within the Hyve-gateways. *Skall: shatterproof material grown as plant-like stalks and used almost exclusively in the manufacture of shields, armor and weapons (contact and edged). It is impervious to damage from venom. *Slazor: pneumatic projectile weapon throwing pellets capable of piercing skall. Slazors also use compressed venom-gas ammunition; these pellets burst on impact into small, poisonous clouds. The merest whiff of said gas infects its victims with bliss so glorious that it drives them insane; the victims slowly die witless. *Sting-Launcher: rubber- powered heavy weapon for firing spine-bombs or stun-spears. Commonly mounted on insectoid steeds. These weapons were carried by Battle Beetle in the animated series for the Sectaurs and used extensively, but were not present in either the comic incarnation nor the toy for Battle Beetle. **Spine-Bomb canister fired from a sting-launcher designed to explode and release hundreds of razor-sharp quills (technically, flechettes) at high velocity over a six- meter-diameter area (three meters in every direction). Can be fired from a sting-launcher. **Stun-Spears: sting-launcher ammunition, used mostly to capture insectoids. One spear will paralyze a steed-size insectoid for an hour. *Sting Troopers: elite corps of Synax. With their swordsmanship and their cunning abilities at in-fighting, any one of them is rated a match for any ten ordinary Sectaur warriors. Commanded and trained by Waspax. *Swamp of Death: located south of the Sea of Acid and southwest of Prosperon. *Telebond: ability to share the mind and senses of another. This term is used exclusively in the comic to denote the deep mental bond of a Sectaur and Insectoid to each other, but in the toyline and mini-comics as also a blanket term for other lesser bondings, such as the secondary bond of Dargon and Parafly, or the mental attunement of a weapon such as a dart wing. *Vengun: spring-loaded gun for firing poison darts; range about forty meters. Its skall darts are filled with the venom of a creature called a Venipede. **Venipede: A giant insectoid, first discovered (by accident) in the Swamp of Death. Venom taken from a live Venipede is used to fill vengun ammunition. *Venom Whip: a poison-tipped weapon crafted from a Triceralon antenna. Like a vengun dart, the whip causes instant death if it breaks the skin. TV series In 1986, Ruby-Spears produced a 5-episode miniseries. 1\\\\.

An alternate name is Pan-Aves, or \\"all birds\\", in reference to its definition containing all animals, living or extinct, which are more closely related to birds than to crocodilians. Almost all avemetatarsalians are members of a similarly defined subgroup, Ornithodira. Ornithodira is defined as the last common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and all of its descendants. Members of this group include the Dinosauromorpha, Pterosauromorpha, the genus Scleromochlus, and Aphanosauria. Dinosauromorpha contains more basal forms, including Lagerpeton and Marasuchus, as well as more derived forms, including dinosaurs. Birds belong to the dinosaurs as members of the theropods. Pterosauromorpha contains Pterosauria, which were the first vertebrates capable of true flight. Aphanosauria is a Triassic group of gracile carnivorous quadrupeds which was recognized in 2017. Description The \\"advanced mesotarsal\\" ankle present in most avemetatarsalians. The foundational characteristic is the \\"advanced mesotarsal\\" ankles, which are characterized by a large astragalus and a small calcaneum. This ankle orientation operated on a single hinge, allowing for better mobility. Probably as a result of this change, the common ancestor of the avemetatarsalians had an upright, bipedal posture, with their legs extending vertically, similar to that of mammals. Feathers and other filamentary structures are known across the avemetatarsalians, from the downy pycnofibers of pterosaurs, to quill-like structures present in ornithischian dinosaurs, such as Psittacosaurus and Tianyulong, to feathers in theropod dinosaurs and their descendants, birds. Two clades of avemetatarsalians, pterosaurs and birds, independently evolved flight. Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings are formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. Birds evolved flight much later. Their wings formed from elongated fingers and their arms, all covered with flight feathers. Avemetatarsalians were generally more lightly built than crocodile-line archosaurs. They had smaller heads and usually a complete lack of osteoderms. Origin Bird-line archosaurs appear in the fossil record by the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic about 245 million years ago, represented by the dinosauriform Asilisaurus. However, Early Triassic fossil footprints reported in 2010 from the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie (Holy Cross) Mountains of Poland may belong to a more primitive dinosauromorph. If so, the origin of avemetatarsalians would be pushed back into the early Olenekian age, around 249 Ma. The oldest Polish footprints are classified in the ichnogenus Prorotodactylus and were made by an unknown small quadrupedal animal, but footprints called Sphingopus, found from Early Anisian strata, show that moderately large bipedal dinosauromorphs had appeared by 246 Ma. The tracks show that the dinosaur lineage appeared soon after the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event. Their age suggests that the rise of dinosaurs was slow and drawn out across much of the Triassic. The primitive traits found in the quadrupedal aphanosaur Teleocrater shows that the earliest avemetatarsalians had many pseudosuchian-like features, and that the traits typical for the group evolved later.Dinosaur Evolution: Crocodile-Like Ancient Cousin, Teleocrater Rhadinus, Confuses Scientists Classification In 1986, Jacques Gauthier defined the name Ornithosuchia (previously coined by Huene) for a branch-based clade including all archosaurs more closely related to birds than to crocodiles.Gauthier, J. A. (1986). \\"Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds.\\" The Origin of Birds and the Evolution of Flight, K. Padian (ed.), Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences 8:1‚Äì55 [M. Carrano/M. Carrano/M. Carrano] In the same year, Gauthier also coined and defined a slightly more restrictive node-based clade, Ornithodira, containing the last common ancestor of the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs and all of its descendants. Paul Sereno in 1991 gave a different definition of Ornithodira, one in which Scleromochlus was explicitly added.Sereno, P. C. 1991. Basal archosaurs: phylogenetic relationships and functional implications. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoir 2, 11(4, Supplement):1‚Äì53. It was thus a potentially larger group than the Ornithodira of Gauthier. In 1999 Michael Benton concluded that Scleromochlus was indeed outside Gauthier's original conception of Ornithodira, so he named a new branch-based clade for this purpose: Avemetatarsalia, named after the birds (Aves), the last surviving members of the clade, and the metatarsal ankle joint that was a typical character of the group. Avemetatarsalia was defined as all Avesuchia closer to Dinosauria than to Crocodylia. In 2005, Sereno stated the opinion that Ornithodira was not a useful concept, whereas Avemetatarsalia was. In 2001, the same clade was given the name Pan-Aves (meaning \\"all [pan in Greek] birds\\" [aves in Latin]), coined by Jacques Gauthier. He defined it as the largest and most inclusive clade of archosaurs containing Aves (birds, anchored on Vultur gryphus) but not Crocodylia (anchored on Crocodylus niloticus). Gauthier referred Aves, all other Dinosauria, all Pterosauria, and a variety of Triassic archosaurs, including Lagosuchus and Scleromochlus, to this group.Gauthier, J. and de Queiroz, K. (2001). \\"Feathered dinosaurs, flying dinosaurs, crown dinosaurs,and the name \\"Aves\\"\\". pp. 7‚Äì41 in Gauthier, J. and L. F. Gall (eds.), New Perspectives on the Origin and Early Evolution of Birds: Proceedings of the International Symposium in Honor of John H. Ostrom. New Haven: Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University. . In a 2005 review of archosaur classification, Phil Senter attempted to resolve this conflicting set of terminology by applying strict priority to names based on when and how they were first defined. Senter noted that Ornithosuchia, the earliest name used for the total group of archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles, should be the valid name for that group, and have precedence over later names with identical definitions, such as Avemetatarsalia and Pan-Aves. While this has been followed by some researchers, others have either continued to use Avemetatarsalia or Ornithodira, or have followed Senter only reluctantly. Mike Taylor (2007) for example noted that, while Senter is correct in stating that Ornithosuchia has priority, this is \\"undesirable\\" because it probably excludes the eponymous family Ornithosuchidae, and questioned the utility of using priority before the PhyloCode is implemented to govern it. In fact, the name Ornithosuchia may be \\"illegal\\" under the PhyloCode because it does not include its eponymous taxon as part of its definition. Cladogram after Nesbitt et al. (2017), with clade names from Cau (2018).

The series ran for three seasons from 1996 to 1999. In 1996, it was carried by the UPN Kids block on UPN, but later seasons were syndicated by BKN. Jumanji was produced by Adelaide Productions and was the first show made by that company, with character designs by Everett Peck. Plot Judy and Peter Shepherd are two kids that found a board game called \\"Jumanji\\". Each turn, the two of them were given a \\"game clue\\" and then sucked into the jungle until they solved their clue. They meet Alan Parrish, who was trapped in Jumanji because he had never seen his clue. Judy and Peter would help Alan try to leave the game, providing the characters' motivation during the series. Also, Peter would sometimes be transformed into various animals whenever he cheated, sometimes using the abilities of whatever animal he becomes to an advantage. The kids also free another player trapped longer than Alan. Unlike Alan, he saw his clue but never solved it, but with the kids' help he solves it. He called himself the Master of Jumanji and tried to get other people to solve his clue for him, but once Alan points out that his clue (the Gateless Gate) is an illusion of Jumanji's and he accepts it, it solves his clue. It's also revealed that like Judy and Peter, Alan would never have been able to survive his first day in Jumanji without help, as he possessed poor survival skills at the time. Ironically, his help came in the form of Judy and Peter from the future (to him anyway) who help him survive and teach him a few of the survival tricks they'd learned from him. In return, the 10-year-old version of Alan helps Judy and Peter return to their time, but later hits his head and forgets meeting them. In the first episode, Alan reveals that there have been other players of the game throughout time, many of whom left their toys in the cave which is part of his home, but not all of them survived the game. In the final episode, using a crystal that shows the past, the kids and Alan find his clue by observing his role and what the game said, and figure out why he never saw it: right after he rolled his mom called him to dinner and as he was leaving, the clue displayed while he had his back turned and he got sucked in. Once he knew his clue, Alan solved it with Judy and Peter's help and escaped Jumanji. Outside, the kids decide to destroy the Jumanji game now that Alan's free. In the series, it is revealed that Jumanji is sentient to a degree and on occasion has sucked in Judy and Peter if they make it \\"angry\\". Episodes =Changes= While the show followed the movie's plot, there were a few changes such as the exclusion of Bonnie Hunt's character Sarah Whittle and the age and relationship of the policeman Carl Bentley (played by David Alan Grier in the movie) was changed somewhat. Characters =Main= * Alan Robert John Jason Parrish III (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) - Judy and Peter's companion in Jumanji. He has been trapped in the game since he was a boy and can only get out if he sees his original clue. According to the Jumanji database, he got trapped in Jumanji on April 3, 1972 (although in \\"Young Alan,\\" he says its 1965 and in the live action film it was 1969). In \\"Young Alan,\\" he was a ten and a half-year-old boy (although in the live-action film, he was twelve-years old), son of the late owner of a now long shut-down shoe factory and friends with future Officer Bentley. Judy and Peter free him at the end of the show by helping him find and solve his original clue. He tries to get free throughout the series and sometimes succeeds, but always ends up trapped back in the game until he's finally freed by solving his long-lost clue. Alan was freed from the game by pulling a thorn from a lion's paw, which was ironic since he had encountered the same lion not long after first entering the game. It is revealed that he considers Peter and Judy his family and that his worst fear is that he has no clue and will die an old man, trapped in Jumanji with Peter and Judy spending the rest of their lives trying to free him. * Judy Shepherd (voiced by Debi Derryberry) - Peter's older sister. She is smart and gets teased for it, although her intelligence helps them solve problems. Judy also has boy troubles as shown in various episodes. She refers to Peter as \\"Peabody\\" a lot. In \\"Nothing to Fear\\", it is revealed that Judy has a fear of cockroaches. * Peter Shepherd (voiced by Ashley Johnson as a kid, Cam Clarke as an adult) - Judy's younger brother. It's stated in \\"Eye of the Sea\\" that Peter is nine years old. Unlike his live- action counterpart who is shy and soft, the animated Peter is immature, quite troubled and has constant trouble with his sister to whom he often shows disrespect. He constantly says \\"Cool Beans\\". Although in season 2 and 3, this mostly changes to Nizer. Peter constantly cheats and transforms into various animals such as a monkey from the live action film and other jungle animals (a toucan, a warthog and a salamander). He can also speak Manji (presumably Alan taught him) and seems to have somewhat of a friendship with them because he saved their leader, Tribal Bob. In \\"Nothing to Fear\\", it is revealed that Peter's worst fear is to be seen naked. =Villains= In Jumanji, there are many dangerous characters. Many appear only once or have background appearances in some episodes. These villains include: * Van Pelt (voiced by Sherman Howard) - The big-game hunter who wants to mount everyone's heads on his wall. He hunts everything, man or beast without remorse. Van Pelt hates Alan and wants to kill him (referred to as human hunting). His most commonly used word if anything goes wrong is \\"Blast!\\" Van Pelt is killed by Peter in one episode, but Peter becomes him as there must always be a hunter in Jumanji. As a result, Alan and Judy bring him back to life. Van Pelt has poor communication skills. One episode revealed that Van Pelt even shot his maid at the time when Alan, Judy, and Peter sneaked into his house to obtain his pith helmet. * J.H. \\"Trader\\" Slick (voiced by Tim Curry) - The wicked merchant of Jumanji who sells items to anyone who can meet the terms of his transactions and has been known to sell simple tools to rare and powerful artifacts to a vast clientele throughout the series. J.H. Slick lives and sells his wares at a trading post located at the heart of the jungle. He always says his whole name when introducing himself, but his middle name changes a lot of time. Some of the items that J.H. Slick has sold include a rare paint that he tricked Alan into buying, the Slick-o-Matic, a giant potion to make Peter grow and later the antidote, the Chrono-Repeater, a \\"Get Out of Jumanji Free\\" Card that was only valid once, a love potion for Judy, and even a motorboat which allows Peter and Judy to return to their time. If necessary, J.H. Slick becomes a real danger to the trio even when paired up with some of the other villains like his occasional team-ups with Van Pelt and Professor J.S. Ibsen. But his biggest part of the series is just a sly cunning swindler (a.k.a. \\"Honest John Dealership\\") like how he once swindled Ashton Philips out of his compass. * Professor J.S. Ibsen (voiced by William Sanderson) - A mechanical genius, Professor J.S. Ibsen is Jumanji's resident mad scientist, referring to himself as a \\"Master Builder.\\" In reality, he is an android. Tasked to work on behalf of Jumanji, Ibsen operates from a large Industrial Era factory where he designs dangerous Steampunk-style machines and vehicles, creating game perils and nightmarish mechanoid obstacles such as battle-armored rhinos, acid- tongued frogs, and biting \\"berbalangs\\". Regarding his machinations, he'll transmit nightly vocal reports to Jumanji itself, broadcasting throughout the jungle. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" Ibsen was present at J.H. Slick's auctioning of the Transvector of Jumanji (a 'MacGuffin' which is similar to a Lemarchand's box). However, he elected to steal the device rather than outright bid for it, intending to destroy the Transvector on account of its potential threat to the entire world of Jumanji. In \\"Robo-Peter\\", Ibsen initiated a master scheme to replace all young people in the \\"real world\\" with androids, trapping the humans in the game world. However, Alan, Peter and Judy thwart this, resulting in the professor's factory being destroyed. J.S. Ibsen's first and middle name initials are a reference to William Sanderson's renowned character J.F. Sebastian from the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner. Also, Ibsen's surname is a reference to Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and his 1893 stage play The Master Builder, the title being re-used for the title of Professor Ibsen's debut episode \\"Master Builder\\". * Captain Ishmael Squint (voiced by Charles Napier) - The cruel pirate who sails the Jumanji Sea. In \\"Eye of the Sea\\", he lost his nose during the battle against the Draken (a one-eyed sea monster which is a cross between a dragon and a kraken) over 20 years ago. Squint's vengeful pursuit of the Draken is reminiscent of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick (his name is a reference to the Moby Dick story in that its first line is \\"Call me Ishmael\\"). The monster ate Squint alive before Alan stabbed it in the eye, killing it. In \\"Return of Squint\\", Captain Squint later came back alive with two new shipmates. He forces Judy, Peter, and Alan to help him search for treasure at the bottom of the sea with Ibsen's submarine, but got captured by demonic mermaids with his new shipmates while the other three escape. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" Squint was present at J.H. Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. When Alan, Judy, and Peter competed with Professor Ibsen to dispose of the Trans- Vector device, Captain Squint is among the villains that try to reclaim it. ** Mr. Shreve - Squint's 1st shipmate who wears an eyepatch. ** Mr. Shatic - Squint's 2nd shipmate who has a peg-leg. * Stalker (voiced by Richard Allen) - The demonic Grim Reaper-like villain who is the Protector of Jumanji. He's also implied to be the personification of the term \\"Game Over\\" as in the episode \\"The Gift\\" he is seen holding a dead jaguar that Van Pelt was hunting at the time. This is further enforced by the fact that J.H. Slick, Professor Ibsen, Van Pelt, and a Manji warrior showed extreme fear when confronted by him. He first appeared in \\"No Dice\\" when Alan stole the dice from the real world. Stalker wanted the game's dice that Alan stole as if the dice were ever destroyed, nobody would be able to play Jumanji again. He is apparently destroyed when he is crushed by a piston, but is revealed to have survived. In \\"The Gift\\", Stalker brought Van Pelt, J.H. Slick, and Professor Ibsen together to kill the kids after Alan was poisoned by a centipede as Peter threatened to destroy Jumanji if Alan died. He is again defeated after being shoved down a waterfall by Alan, but survives again as he crawls out of the river. Stalker's name and purpose was never revealed in the show. * Ashton Philips (voiced by Dabney Coleman) - The greedy adventurer. Ashton Philips considers himself the biggest and bravest and betrays even his agents Alan, Judy and Peter. His catchphrase is \\"Aston Philips has done it again\\". Though he was thought to have died in the Temple of Riddles in \\"The Palace of Clues,\\" Ashton Philips actually survived and resurfaced when it came to looking for the Golden Goblet of Jumanjicon. He encountered Alan, Judy, and Peter again in their search for the artifact and even reclaimed his compass that Trader Slick swindled him into trading. After drinking from the Golden Goblet of Jumanjicon, he reverted to childhood form while maintaining his mind. * Ludwig Von Richtor (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) - The German hunter who is the rival of Van Pelt. He competed with Van Pelt in hunting Alan. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" Ludwig Von Richtor was present at J.H. Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. When Alan, Judy, and Peter competed with Professor Ibsen to dispose of the Trans-Vector device, Ludwig Von Richtor is among the villains that try to reclaim it. * The Judge (voiced by Edward Asner) - An ape-like lawkeeper that presided over the trial of Alan when he was accused of stealing the Singing Orb from an ape. However, the Judge is not a benevolent judge as he condemns all without regard to innocence. He is also very greedy as shown when he takes an orb from the Fludgels and is sucked into it. The Judge's only weapon is \\"Justice\\" which is a giant gorilla. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" the Judge was present at Trader Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. He threatened Slick with serious charges if it was not the genuine article. When Alan, Judy, and Peter competed with Professor Ibsen to dispose of the Trans- Vector device, the Judge is among the villains that try to reclaim it. * Flint (voiced by Charlie Schlatter) - An evil wizard created by Jumanji to mess with Judy's mind. Turns people into stone, but is defeated by Judy when she reflects his own attack back at him, freeing his victims and turning him to stone. He is presumably destroyed when his statue falls thousands of feet to the ground. * Queen Gina (voiced by Cathy Moriarty) - The leader of the Jamazons (which is short for \\"Jumanji Amazons\\"). She tries to marry Alan, but is defeated by Aunt Nora. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" Queen Gina was present at Trader Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. She did not take part in the bidding for the device or reclaiming the device. Instead, Queen Gina seemed interested in reclaiming Alan (probably to try and marry him again). * Black Ant Queen - The Black Ant leader of Jumanji. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" the Black Ant Queen was present at Trader Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. She did not take part in the reclaiming of the device. * Red Ant Queen - The Red Ant leader of Jumanji. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" the Red Ant Queen was present at Trader Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. She did not take part in the reclaiming of the device. * Sand King (voiced by Jim Cummings) - The sand monster who is the ruler of Jumanji's Sand Kingdom and tries to get a chest of cursed gold from Judy, Peter and Alan. He gets defeated by Peter with a squirt gun. In \\"The Ultimate Weapon,\\" the Sand King was present at Trader Slick's auction for the Trans-Vector of Jumanji. ** Tribal Bob (voiced by Richard Allen) - The leader of the Manji Tribe. * The Lion - The Lion was a large fierce lion who chased Alan from the moment he entered Jumanji and has been doing so ever since. He first appeared in \\"Young Alan\\" where he was seen chasing Alan when he was 10 years old for the first time. In the last episode \\"Goodbye Jumanji,\\" it was revealed that the Lion was part of Alan's clue and the reason it chased for years was because it had a thorn in its paw which caused it extreme pain and so Alan built up enough courage to remove it resulting in his clue being solved but not before the lion gave him a thank you lick before leaving. Although many other lions have appeared in the show frequently, they weren't the same one. =Others= * Aunt Nora Shepherd (voiced by Melanie Chartoff) - Judy and Peter's aunt and legal guardian. She is taken into the game a couple of times, but the kids convince her it was a dream. Later after Alan is finally freed by Judy and Peter, there are indications of a possible romantic relationship between the two. Nora is a therapist and does aerobics which allow her in Jumanji to defeat the Jamazon Queen Gina. While she thinks her adventures in Jumanji are a dream, they seem to help her lighten up if only for a little while afterwards. * The Manji Tribe (Various Voices) - The Manji tribe are fearsome bloodthirsty warriors whom no man they call a friend (although they have shown tolerance towards Alan, Peter and Judy). They are led by Tribal Bob. They don't just wear tribal masks, they are tribal masks. It is implied that a Manji warrior can only change back if he willingly removes the mask himself as in the same case with Peter when, in one episode, he joins them when he becomes more and more enamoured with their lifestyle. It's also heavily implied in one episode that the Manjis were all once humans themselves, possibly child players who decided to stay in Jumanji, finally gave up solving the clues they were shown and sought to leave their own world far behind. Despite the primitive way they communicate and vocalize their native language (which is composed of squeaks, clicks, buzzes, whistles and hand gestures) speaking Manji is very complicated as they have more than 500 words for pain as Peter tells Judy in one episode. It's notable that unlike the other threats of Jumanji, the Manji are willing to work against Jumanji's interests as indirectly giving Peter the clues to cure a poisoned Allen and actively physically protect Peter and Judy from Slick, Van Pelt, and Ibsen (who were under orders from Jumanji itself to kill the children), and explicitly only try to eat one of the children brought into Jumanji one time after confirming they are not a friend of Peter's (and sparing one they confirm is). * The Master of Jumanji (voiced by Tony Jay) - A former player who got stuck in Jumanji years before Alan because he couldn't solve his clue. His clue was first seen written on the wall in the Palace of Lost Clues. When he realized what his clue meant, the Master of Jumanji disappeared to his own time in the real world. * Officer Carl Bentley (voiced by Richard Allen) - A police officer that patrols Judy and Peter's neighborhood. In an earlier part of his life, he was a friend of Alan Parrish and used to work at a shoe factory that later shut down. * Rock (voiced by Pamela Adlon) - A school bully who picks on Peter. He has a group of three close friends. * Dorothy \\"Dottie\\" McGrail (voiced by Eileen Brennan) - A flying ace who somehow managed to fly into Jumanji in her plane via a hole in the sky. She, along with Alan, Peter and Judy, help save the eggs and village of a race of bird-people called Jumockis which were under threat from Professor Ibsen in his dirigible. * The \\"Banana Brains\\" - A trio of monkeys that reside in Jumanji, the first small monkey resembles the ones from the film, the second looks like a gorilla but with a tail, and the third looks like a baboon with a lazy left eye and acts as the leader of the group. They are well known for causing mischief and wreaking havoc for everyone who crosses their path or who ruins their \\"fun.\\" Principal cast * Bill Fagerbakke - Alan Parrish * Debi Derryberry - Judy Shepherd * Ashley Johnson - Peter Shepherd * Pamela Adlon - Rock * Melanie Chartoff - Aunt Nora Shepherd * Tim Curry - Trader Slick * Sherman Howard - Van Pelt * Richard Allen - Stalker, Officer Bentley, Tribal Bob * William Sanderson - Professor Ibsen * Kevin Schon - Dead-Eye =Additional voices= * Beverly Archer - Peter's Teacher * Edward Asner - The Judge, Repairman * Ren√© Auberjonois - Professor Alsip * Bob Bergen - Science Teacher * Cam Clarke - Adult Peter Shepherd, Justin Galloway * Dabney Coleman - Ashton Phillips * Jim Cummings - Sand King Shocker * Tony Jay - Master * Bob Joles - Coach Bartlett * Roddy McDowall - Furvish * Cathy Moriarty - Queen Gina * Charles Napier - Captain Ishmael Squint * Alan Oppenheimer - Ludwig Von Richtor * Bibi Osterwald - Ms. Desmona * Charlie Schlatter - Flint, Wade Riley B-Bop A Luna Crew * Susan Blu - Dialogue Director Broadcast In 1996, it was carried by the UPN Kids block on UPN, but later seasons were syndicated by BKN.

It was written and produced by Abe Levy and Silver Tree, who was a flight attendant herself for many years. The film stars Lara Phillips, Josh Randall, Michael Gilio, and Claire Rankin. Plot Summer Pozzi (Lara Phillips), a Chicago-based flight attendant for an unnamed airline, is mentally preparing to quit her job and marry Jim, her soon-to-be airline pilot boyfriend. During a layover, she gets a phone call asking her to transfer to San Francisco. Then, Jim tells her he refused to take a final exam to be a pilot, unable to have the lives of many passengers on his shoulders. Shaken and disappointed, Summer decides to go ahead with the transfer, and promises herself not to fall for another man too quickly. Once in San Francisco, she moves into a small apartment with three other flight attendants, one of them who was supposed to be moving out. There's Portia (Rachel Luttrell), a posh but insecure British girl undergoing an eternal makeover, Kate (Claire Rankin), who is very bitchy ever since Summer reprimanded her on a previous flight and Lucas (Michael Gilio), with whom Summer immediately has a one-night stand. During a layover, she later meets Julian (Josh Randall), the captain of her dreams. She is immediately in love. He is based in Hong Kong, and meeting him every week in New York poses a challenge, which will come to an end very suddenly, as she realizes her actions cost one of her friends' job and maybe even someone else's life, and as she sees Julian as anything but the perfect man he once appeared to be.

The division traces its lineage back to the 32nd Rifle Division (First formation) of the Soviet Union's Red Army, first formed in 1922 and converted into the 29th Guards Rifle Division in 1942 for its actions in the Battle of Moscow during World War II. Postwar, it was stationed in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and redesignated as the 36th Guards Mechanized Division in 1946 and the 36th Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1957. To perpetuate the lineage of the disbanded 8th Guards Motor Rifle Division, the 36th Guards was redesignated as the former and adopted its history in 1960. When the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Division was transferred to Central Asia in 1967, the 144th Motor Rifle Division was formed at Tallinn to replace it and redesignated as the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division to inherit the traditions of the 36th Guards later that year. After the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Baltics following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the division became part of the Russian Ground Forces and was sent to Yelnya, where it was reduced to a storage base in 1993, which disbanded during the mid-2000s. As part of a Russian military buildup in the mid-2010s, the division was reformed as the 144th Motor Rifle Division in 2016 at Yelnya, and redesignated as the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division to become the official successor of the previous formation of the same name in 2018. World War II The 32nd Division part in the battle of Moscow did not escape the notice of the Soviet high command and it was given the title 29th Guards Rifle Division and the 17th Rifle Regiment received the Order of the Red Banner. Its regiments were given new Guards unit numberings as the 87th, 90th, and 93rd Guards Rifle Regiments. The next appearance of the division in battle was in the Ukraine in January 1944 with the 37th Army. Later that year it was moved to the Baltic area and was the first Soviet division into Riga. It ended the war as part of 10th Guards Army still in the Baltic region.  Cold War  The 29th Guards Rifle Division was reorganised into the 36th Guards Mechanised Division, and then on 25 June 1957 the division became the 36th Guards Motor Rifle Division. Three years later, on 23 June 1960, the division was disbanded by being renamed the 8th Guards Rezhitskaya Order of Lenin Red Banner order of Suvorov Motorised Rifle Division \\"Major-General I.V. Panfilov\\". By this time, the 87th Guards Rifle Regiment had become the 282nd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment; it was dispatched to Kyrgyzstan with the division, and, many years later, eventually after the dissolution of the Soviet Union became a Kyrgyz motor rifle brigade. On 18 February 1967, the 144th Motor Rifle Division was formed in Tallinn, Estonian SSR, Baltic Military District, replacing the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was about to transfer to Frunze, Kyrgyz SSR.Michael Holm, 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division, 2015. Ten months later, on 23 December 1967, the division was given the traditions, honors and awards of the 36th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which had been disbanded in 1960. It was therefore renamed the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division. Holm 2015 and Feskov et al. 2013 list the regiments of the division in 1970 as follows: *254th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment (Tallinn, Estonian SSR) - from the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Division *482nd Motor Rifle Regiment (Klooga, Estonian SSR) *488th Motor Rifle Regiment (Klooga, Estonian SSR) *228th Tank Regiment (Keyla/Keila, Estonian SSR) *450th Artillery Regiment (Klooga, Estonian SSR) *1259th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment (Klooga, Estonian SSR) Holm writes that the division was maintained as a Not Ready Division - Cadre Low Strength (US terms: Category III) - manning was 15% (2000 men).  Russian Ground Forces service  After the fall of the Soviet Union it was withdrawn to Yelnya, Yelninsky District, Smolensk Oblast in the Moscow Military District and was reorganised as the 4944th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment. It was planned that in a crisis it would be capable of being brought back to up to full division strength. The 4944th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base was disbanded in 2007. The 144th Motor Rifle Division was reformed in 2016 as part of the 20th Guards Army. By a decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin on 30 June 2018, it inherited the lineage of the 29th Guards Rifle Division and its successors.

He is the highest-scoring player in the history of Guatemala's top division. As of January 2010, Plata has, except for Marc Lloyd-Williams, been the most prolific scorer among all active players in the world in top division leagues,\\"The World's most successful Top Division Goal Scorers among the still active Players\\" ‚Äì www.iffhs.de ‚Äì IFFHS ‚Äì retrieved 23 January 2008. and is among the top 60 goalscorers of all time in the world\\"The World's most successful Top Division Goal Scorers of all time\\" ‚Äì www.iffhs.de ‚Äì IFFHS ‚Äì retrieved 31 October 2006. according to the International Federation of Football History & Statistics. He is also the second-highest goalscorer in the history of the Guatemala national team behind Carlos Ruiz. Plata played all of his professional club career for CSD Municipal and is also the all-time top goalscorer for that club; he has broken virtually every scoring record associated with professional football in Guatemala. He also has won 15 domestic league titles, 5 domestic cup titles, and 2 international titles playing for Municipal. Playing style Plata was not a very physically gifted player, but he was a technical player with a good sense of positioning and playing without the ball. He was not only a good finisher but he could also be a creative playmaker and passer. His personal-best 33 goals in one season came at age 35, a testament to his reliance on intelligent play instead of pure athletic ability. Club career Plata, born in Guatemala City, made his debut in the Liga Mayor (Major League, now Liga Nacional) in the 1990‚Äì1991 league season, won by Municipal, under coach Rub√©n Amor√≠n. He has since been a regular for the club, and has helped them win 14 league titles, 5 domestic cups, and 2 Central American championships. A consistent goalscorer throughout his career, Plata has scored at least 15 goals in 13 different seasons, with his most prolific season in terms of total goals scored being 2005‚Äì2006, when he scored 32 goals in total for both the Torneo de Apertura and the Torneo de Clausura. On 15 February 2008, Plata played his 500th official match with Municipal against Deportivo Zacapa for the domestic league.Source: http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/2008/febrero/16/220761.html On 17 May 2009, Plata scored his 400th career goal against Deportivo Petapa.Source: http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/2009/mayo/17/314921.html =Notable goals= Plata holds the domestic record for most goals scored in finals. Some of his most memorable performances include scoring 4 goals in a 9‚Äì2 beatdown over rival team CSD Comunicaciones in the Apertura 2004 final. He also scored 2 late goals in the Apertura 2005 championship over Comunicaciones to win the title. In the Clausura 2005 final, he scored a record 4 goals in one game against CD Suchitepequez to win another title. His latest final was against Xelaj√∫ MC in the Clausura 2010 tournament, coming in as a late substitute after being inactive for the majority of the tournament due to a major injury and scoring a header which gave Municipal its third goal in an eventual 3‚Äì1 victory. In the second game he again came in as a late substitute and again scored a goal to add a second goal to a 7‚Äì1 aggregate victory and his fifteenth league title with Municipal.

The 94-minute film makes emphasis on the scoring of goal 321, which gave Plata the record as top goal scorer in the history of professional Guatemalan football. It also covers his ongoing career as well as non-sport related subjects, such as family and business. The premiere took place at the Centro Cultural Miguel √Ångel Asturias (national theatre), with over 2000 people in attendance. The documentary and other additional features, are included in a DVD which includes over 200 of his career goals and was released for sale to the public on the night of the film's premiere. Retirement from active career and number retirement On 19 December 2010 Juan Carlos Plata played his last official game as a professional player in Guatemala, as a substitute in the final match for Apertura 2011, a series defining the national championship between CSD Municipal and Comunicaciones. The match ended in a draw 2‚Äì2 (being 3‚Äì3 the global score), so there was the need to define the championship on penalty series. At that time he scored a goal, however his team lost dramatically, he retired being a national Second Place. On 9 January 2011 Juan Carlos Plata received a tribute and played a friendly match between his team CSD Municipal and an informal team composed by former and active players (all of them played at least once with Juan Carlos Plata either in CSD Municipal or Guatemalan national team), named \\"Estrellas de Plata\\" (Plata's Stars). Right after the match completion, the number 15, which was used by Juan Carlos Plata during his whole career, was officially retired from CSD Municipal, being the first and only soccer player in Guatemala who is granted with this honour, thus he forms part of the Retired numbers in association football.

It was officially opened by The Princess Royal in October 2009.http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Princess-Anne-s-whistle-stop-tour- Bristol/article-1415673-detail/article.html BLC, as an all through school, enjoys a rare identity as one of only a handful of schools in the UK where a child can begin and end their entire school career within the same establishment. There are many potential benefits to this approach, both operationally for the school and ultimately for the educational progress of the pupils. BLC has incorporated the secondary school formerly known as Hartcliffe Engineering Community College, and also the former Teyfant Community Primary School. BLC (or \\"The Bridge\\" as it has become known) has been constructed as part of the former Labour Government's Building Schools for the Future programme (since scrapped).http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10514113.stm Additionally, New Fosseway Special School also re-located to the new site in 2009, joining the campus organisation. One of the key drivers for the establishment of BLC is the need to improve educational standards in the Hartcliffe area, particularly at secondary school levels. There is little doubt that standards have increased for the school, as GCSE results have risen year-on-year for Bridge Learning Campus Secondary since 2005.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/09/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/801_4042.stm The staff within the new campus are determined to innovate. There is still a distinction between the primary and secondary areas of the campus, however due to an introduction of a phasing system, pupils are no longer educated based on their age. Rather, pupils in all phases will be in classes based on their ability. The adoption of this phasing system has been recognised by Ofsted in their most recent inspection of the secondary phases as a positive development,http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/School-bridges-gap-vision- determination/article-2282619-detail/article.html and also during a visit by former Secretary of State Ed Balls. The original Hartcliffe School was built in the late 1950s and was home to over 2200 students on the site now occupied by BLC. The original school was built to serve new housing which replaced bomb damaged properties during the post-World War II period and at the time it was one of the largest schools in the country. The original buildings have since been demolished as part of the rebuild. Future It was proposed to convert to an academy on 1 November 2012. This was pushed back to 1 December 2012, followed by 1 January 2013, then 1 February 2013, then again until 1 March 2013.

She was one of the two ironclads of the , the other being . She was built in the Samuda Brothers shipyard at Cubitt Town, London, for service with the Ottoman Navy, under the name of Peik-i-Sheref, and was taken over for the Royal Navy in a completed condition. She was, however, not regarded as fit to serve as a British warship until a number of extensive and expensive modifications were carried out. Design She had been intended to carry 10-inch calibre guns, and the first recorded change is \\"enlargement of ports to take 25-ton guns\\" (i.e. guns of 12-inch calibre). Other major alterations included the building in of extra coal bunkers, the fitting of extra officers' cabins and the fitting of torpedo launching apparatus. The main artillery was disposed in a centrally placed octagonal box battery with two guns on each beam. The firing ports were so arranged that it was possible to fire two guns ahead, astern and on a limited bearing on either side. There were limited areas afore and abaft the beam where only one gun could be brought to bear; as the primary armament of this ship, as devised and designed, was her ram, this was regarded by her designer as an acceptable limitation. Being smaller than other contemporary British battleships, she and her sister HMS Orion had comparatively limited range, speed and armament compared to them. However they were initially welcomed by the naval press as being inexpensive, costing only half that of an Audacious class battleship and a third of , but once her drawbacks became obvious they damned her in popular and naval opinion as a front-line fighting vessel. Service history She was commissioned on 2 July 1878, and served for the next fourteen years as coastguard ship at Kingstown, Ireland. Her only activity there was firing practice four times a year, the annual squadron cruise, and one refit at Devonport. In 1887 while stationed in Kingstown Harbour (now Dun Laoghaire) the Commanding Officer invited the entire Water Wag Club to come on board on Tuesday 21 June to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The Water Wags declined the invitation as they were on a Jubilee Cruise to Dalkey Island and did not wish to miss the favourable tide.Alfred & Vincent Delany 'The Water Wags 1887-2012' She paid off into the \\"B\\" Reserve in April 1893, descending into the Fleet Reserve in May 1894. She was paid off in May 1900 and converted into a target ship. After surviving gunfire from in which shells filled with lyddite were tested, she was towed back to Portsmouth. There, she was used to test the effect of guns of 6-inch and of 9.2 inch calibre, and of torpedoes. The torpedo experiments were expected to demonstrate the protective effect of cellulose against these weapons; the cellulose was expected to swell and plug the holes caused by the torpedoes. This did not happen, and Belleisle sank into the mud. She was raised with difficulty in October 1903 and sold for scrap to Germany.

This usage is distinct from the literal sense of \\"one wheeled robot bicycle\\". These theoretical vehicles are typically shown as having two parallel driven wheels, one mounted on each side of their centre, and (presumably) some sort of offset castor to maintain balance; although in general they could be any vehicle capable of simultaneous arbitrary rotation and translation. An alternative realization uses a single driven wheel with steering, and a pair of idler wheels to give balance and allow a steering torque to be applied. A physically realisable unicycle, in this sense, is a nonholonomic system. This is a system in which a return to the original internal (wheel) configuration does not guarantee return to the original system (unicycle) position. In other words, the system outcome is path-dependent.

Galopin was director of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique, a major Belgian company, and chairman of the board of the motor and armaments company Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre (FN). At the head of a group of Belgian industrialists and financiers, he gave his name to the \\"Galopin Doctrine\\" which prescribed how Belgian industry should deal with the moral and economic choices imposed by the occupation. In February 1944, he was assassinated by Flemish collaborators from the DeVlag group. Early career Alexandre Galopin was born in Ghent, East Flanders in Belgium on 28 September 1879. His father was a university professor. Galopin pursued a career in business became in 1913 managing director of Fabrique national d'armes de guerre at Herstal which had originated as a manufacturer of firearms. He championed its development into an important manufacturer of motor vehicles in Belgium. In 1935 he became governor of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (SGB), a giant holding company with close ties to the Belgian government which dominated the economy of Belgium and its colonial empire and controlled almost 40 percent of the country's industrial production. World War II Belgium was invaded by Nazi Germany on 10 May 1940. At the start of the German occupation, Galopin was made chairman of an informal group, dubbed the \\"Galopin Committee\\", which convened senior figures in Belgian economic life, notably representatives of major holding companies, banks, and industry. The committee had been set up by the Belgian government, shortly before it left the country, on 15 May 1940. It served as a sort of a Belgian shadow government in the occupied territory that decided a common stance on economic and social issues and was able to set rules for dealing with the German administration. The committee included politicians and businessmen: *, banker and chairman of the Banque de Bruxelles *Fernand Collin, banker and chairman of Kredietbank *, head of the department store chain *Willy de Munck, Chairman of the *Albert Goffin, official at the National Bank of Belgium and, from 1941, its governor *L√©on Bekaert, industrialist *Albert-Edouard Janssen, Chairman of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique and former finance minister *, Catholic Party ex-minister and lawyer *Emile van Dievoet, Catholic Party ex-minister and law professor Because of his power and influence within the Belgian wartime economy, Galopin was nicknamed \\"the Uncrowned King of Belgium\\" by German occupation officials. =Galopin doctrine= A Belgian worker at the Siemens factory in Berlin. The Gallopin committee failed to prevent the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany in 1942 which had been one of its main objects Part of the goal of the Galopin committee was to keep Belgian industry strong during the war to avoid leaving the economy crippled once the war ended. To that end, Galopin gave his name to a controversial policy known as the \\"Galopin doctrine\\" (Doctrine Galopin). Under that plan, Belgian companies should continue production under German occupation provided that they were producing goods for Belgium's civilian population (such as food or consumer goods) even if it would benefit the German war industry by relieving it from the need to export similar goods. However, Belgian companies should refuse to produce war materiel or goods that were directly usable in the German war effort. The aim of the policy was to prevent a repeat of the economic destruction which had accompanied the German occupation of Belgium during World War I, when workers and businessmen had been encouraged to resist German demands. That had led to the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany in 1916 and the confiscation of capital from firms, which was also sent to Germany. The policy had, in turn, caused unemployment and inflation that continued to damage the Belgian economy for years after the war. Limited co-operation with the German occupiers in non-military production was hoped to limit the war's effects on the Belgian economy and to facilitate post-war economic recovery. It was therefore an extension of a similar policy of \\"lesser evil\\" (moindre mal) adopted by Belgian civil servants through the Committee of Secretaries-General. Initially, it was also supported by the Belgian government in exile. In practice, the distinction between the limited co-operation in the Galopin doctrine and outright collaboration proved difficult to maintain. It was widely perceived as a form of collaborationism in the Belgian population. After some initial acceptance, in 1941 and 1942, German officers began to force Belgian businessmen to disapply the distinction at the risk of personal punishment and the confiscation of their businesses. In 1942, the occupation administration began to deport Belgian workers as forced labourers in Germany as during World War I. However, it has been argued that the co-operative approach represented by the doctrine did prevent German companies from expanding their control over the Belgian economy. The Galopin doctrine was similar to the policy of \\"co-operation\\" (samenwerken) in the German-occupied Netherlands and overseen by senior civil servants such as Hans Hirschfeld. =Assassination= Galopin was assassinated in 1944 by members of Devlag, a radical pro-Nazi paramilitary group active in Flanders, under direct orders from Robert Jan Verbelen. Galopin's name has been given to a street: avenue Alexandre Galopin in Etterbeek, Brussels.

Reproduced at the Child Rights Information Network. Retrieved 2011-04-02. The practice is typically performed by a close female figure to the victim, traditionally fulfilled by a mother, grandmother, aunt, or female guardian who will say she is trying to protect the girl from sexual harassment and rape, to prevent early pregnancy that would tarnish the family name, preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDs, or to allow the girl to pursue education rather than be forced into early marriage. It is mostly practiced in parts of Cameroon, where boys and men may think that girls whose breasts have begun to grow are ready for sex. Evidence suggests that it has spread to the Cameroonian diaspora, for example to Britain, where the law defines it as child abuse. The most widely used implement for breast ironing is a wooden pestle normally used for pounding tubers. Other tools used include leaves, bananas, coconut shells, grinding stones, ladles, spatulas, and hammers heated over coals. The ironing practice is generally performed around dusk or dawn in a private area such as the household kitchen to prevent others from seeing the victim or becoming aware of the process, particularly fathers or other male figures. The massaging process could occur anywhere between one week to several months, depending on the victim's refusal and the resistance of the breasts; in cases where the breasts appear to be consistently protruding, the ironing practice may occur more than once a day for these weeks or months at a time.  History  Breast ironing may be derived from the ancient practice of breast massage. Breast massage aims to help even out different breast sizes and reduce the pain of nursing mothers by massaging the breast with warm objects, see Mastitis#Treatment. Incidence The breast ironing practice has been documented in Nigeria, Togo, Republic of Guinea, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Additionally it has been found in other African countries including Burkina Faso, Central African Republic (CAR), Benin, and Guinea-Conakry. Breast \\"sweeping\\" has been reported in South Africa. The practice has become commonly associated with Cameroon as a result of media attention and local levels of activism from human rights groups. All of Cameroon's 200 ethnic groups engage in breast ironing, with no known relation to religion, socio- economic status, or any other identifier. A 2006 survey by the German development agency GIZ of more than 5,000 Cameroonian girls and women between the ages of 10 and 82 estimated that nearly one in four had undergone breast ironing, corresponding to four million girls. The survey also reported that it is most commonly practiced in urban areas, where mothers fear their daughters could be more exposed to sexual abuse. Incidence is 53 percent in the Cameroon's southeastern region of Littoral. Compared with Cameroon's Christian and animist south, breast ironing is less common in the Muslim north, where only 10 percent of women are affected. Some hypothesize that this is related to the practice of early marriage, which is more common in the north, making early sexual development irrelevant or even preferable. Research suggests that 16% of girls, particularly in the far North regions where child marriages are highly common, try to flatten their own breasts in an attempt to delay early sexual maturity and early marriage. A 2007 journal suggested that social norms in Cameroon result in women lacking bodily autonomy, as Cameroonian women are not socialized to negotiate safer sex practices, while Cameroonian men are encouraged to engage in polygyny and to take concubines. This lack of bodily autonomy contributes to an increased incidence of breast ironing, sexual coercion, and the normalization of early marriage practices. In an interview, one human rights activist stated that parents who resist under-aged marriages \\"usually point to the fact that the girl ºs breasts have not grown meaning that she is not yet ready for sexual intercourse. For parents who practice child marriage, by ironing the breasts of the prospective bride, they can continue receiving goods and services from their in-laws.\\" A 2008 report suggested that the rise in the incidence of breast ironing is due to the earlier onset of puberty, caused by dietary improvements in Cameroon over the previous 50 years. Half of Cameroonian girls who develop under the age of nine have their breasts ironed, and 38% of those who develop before eleven. Additionally, since 1976, the percentage of women married by the age of 19 has decreased from nearly 50% to 20%, leading to an increasingly long gap between childhood and marriage. The later age of marriage may be due to changed social norms that allow girls and women to attend school through university and to hold jobs in the formal sector; previously, girls entered married life young, wed to an older man without informed consent. Women who delay marriage in pursuit of education and career are more likely to be financially independence later in life, whereas girls who become pregnant are often forced to drop out of school and forgo formal employment. One of the only full-length reports on breast ironing dates from 2011, when a Cameroonian NGO sponsored by the German development agency GTZ called it \\"a harmful traditional practice that has been silenced for too long\\". There are fears that the practice has spread to the Cameroonian diaspora, for example to Britain. A charity, CAME Women and Girls Development Organisation, is working with London's Metropolitan Police Service and social services departments to raise awareness of breast ironing. Health consequences Breast ironing is extremely painful and can cause tissue damage. , there have been no medical studies on its effects. However, medical experts warn that it might contribute toward breast cancer, cysts and depression, and perhaps interfere with breastfeeding later. In addition to this, breast ironing puts girls at risk to future abscesses, cysts, infections, and permanent tissue damage; this resulting in breast pimples, imbalance in breast size, and milk infection from scarring. In extreme cases of damage, there are currently ten cases of diagnosed breast cancer reported from women who identified as victims of breast ironing. Other possible side- effects reported by GIZ include breast infections, the formation of abscesses, malformed breasts and the eradication of one or both breasts. The practice ranges dramatically in its severity, from using heated leaves to press and massage the breasts, to using a scalding grinding stone to crush the budding gland. Due to this variation, health consequences vary from benign to acute. The Child Rights Information Network (CRIN) reports the delay of breast milk development after birth, endangering the life of newborns. Breast ironing can cause women to fear sexual activity. Men have said that breast loss detracts from women's sexual experiences, although this has not been corroborated by women. Aside from physical effects, many women suffer mental trauma after undergoing breast ironing. Victims feel as if it is punishment and often internalise blame, and fear breastfeeding in the future. Victims may lose confidence and self esteem and believe that they should not have breasts. Opposition As well as being dangerous, breast ironing is criticised as being ineffective for stopping early sex and pregnancy. GIZ (then called \\"GTZ\\") and the Network of Aunties (RENATA), a Cameroonian non-governmental organization that supports young mothers, campaign against breast ironing, and are supported by the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Family. Some have also advocated a law against the practice; however, no such law has been passed. Some consider the practice to be an emerging human rights issue, recognized as an act of gender-based violence as breast ironing affects women and girls regardless or race, class, religion, socioeconomic background, or age. In regards to recent opposition, in 2000, the United Nations (UN) identified breast ironing as one of five intersecting forms of discrimination and overlooked crimes against women. According to one Cameroonian lawyer, if a medical doctor determines that damage has been caused to the breasts, the perpetrator can be punished by up to three years in prison, provided the matter is reported within a few months. However, it is unclear if such a law exists as there are no recorded instances of legal enforcement. The GIZ survey found that in 2006, 39 percent of Cameroonian women opposed breast ironing, with 41 percent expressing support and 26 percent indifferent. Reuters reported in 2014 that nationwide campaigning against the practice had helped reduce the rate of breast ironing by 50 percent in the country.

History and career The engine was designed and built by the road's master mechanic, Andrew Jackson \\"A.J\\" Stevens at Sacramento Locomotive Works in 1882. The locomotive had two highly unusual features: the firebox shape and the steam distribution. The only other locomotives to use such a valve gear were the 20 copies of Mastodon (see below) and CPR #237 El Gobernador. All other steam locomotives with slide valves had just a single valve in the center. CPRR 229, now rebuilt and renumbered as SPRR 2925, sits at Wakefield, Oregon, near the end of her life. After being readied for its initial shakedown run, the engine met with a minor mishap in which its large \\"balloon\\" stack was knocked away from the boiler. During all the careful preparations, apparently nobody noticed that the stack was nearly taller than the doors to the roundhouse. The problem was fixed and an impressive series of trials on the steep grades of the Sierra Nevada soon followed, in which it easily outperformed the smaller 4-4-0 and 4-6-0 engines used by the railroad in those days. Later, Mastodon was sent east to the Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works, along with blueprints and men who had built the engine, where more than 20 copies were produced; these were identical except for having their cylinder bore increased to (from Mastodon's ). The success of this engine inspired railroad president Leland Stanford to instruct Stevens to build an even larger locomotive, which would be the largest the world had ever seen up until that time. This engine, a 4-10-0 named El Gobernador (CPRR #237), looked virtually identical to Mastodon, with the exception of being longer and having an additional pair of driving wheels. Unfortunately, this engine, unlike its predecessor, was doomed to failure and was scrapped in 1894. Sometime in the early 20th century, No. 229 (now renumbered as Southern Pacific 2925) was converted from wood to oil-firing and was later assigned to the Oregon lines. Despite its historical significance, the engine was broken up for scrap at the Brooklyn Shops in Portland, Oregon, in June 1935 after a working life of 53 years.

Composed in a monumental style for solo soprano, baritone, choir and orchestra, it features text from Psalms no. 145, 6 and 135, along with an excerpt from Copernicus' book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. The symphony was commissioned by the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York and presented to G√≥recki as an opportunity to reach an audience outside his native Poland. Typically, he undertook extensive research on the subject, and was particularly taken by the philosophical implications of Copernicus' discovery, not all of which he viewed as positive.Thomas (1997), 74 Norman Davies commented: \\"His discovery, of the earth's motion round the sun, caused the most fundamental revolutions possible in the prevailing concepts of the human predicament.\\"Davies, Norman.

The thunderous cosmic vision of the mostly orchestal first movement is answered by a second movement whose proportions are considerably expanded in order to release the earlier tensions.\\"Thomas, New Grove (2001), 10:160.

The two-station extension was built at a cost of $37 million in 1973 dollars. =Renaming= On June 17, 2010 the station was renamed \\"AT&T; Station.\\" Naming rights were sold to AT&T; for five years at a cost of $5 million; SEPTA netted $3 million, while the agency's advertising contractor Titan Outdoor (now Intersection received the remaining $2 million. The costs for renaming ‚Äì included changing of all mentions of the station throughout the line to \\"AT&T; Station and Sports Complex\\" ‚Äì were covered by the $3 million. The initial contract was later extended for an additional three years. On July 25, 2018, SEPTA announced that NRG Energy had agreed to a five-year contract for the station's naming rights, paying $5.25 million. The name change to NRG Station took effect on August 1 and was inaugurated on August 14. Intersection received 15% of this contract, or about $800,000. It cost about $150,000 to change around 7,000 signs in the SEPTA system to reflect the name change, as well as $97,000 to reprint 6,000 route maps. The contract also allows NRG to set up marketing tables in SEPTA stations, as well as rentable portable phone chargers in this station. Station layout Station platform in 2018, prior to its renaming Much like Oregon station, NRG station has its fare control barriers at four street-level headhouses, all located on the east side of Broad Street. The station has an unusually wide and long island platform to accommodate crush capacity crowds that occur regularly after events at the Sports Complex. There is an additional, infrequently-used platform on a level immediately beneath the regular service platform which is visible from the gated stairways along the length of the platform.

Christian feminists argue that contributions by women, and an acknowledgment of women's value, are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. Christian feminists believe that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically-determined characteristics such as sex and race, but created all humans to exist in harmony and equality, regardless of race or gender. Christian feminists generally advocate for anti-essentialism as a part of their belief system, acknowledging that gender identities do not mandate a certain set of personality traits. Their major issues include the ordination of women, biblical equality in marriage, recognition of equal spiritual and moral abilities, reproductive rights, integration of gender neutral pronouns within readings of the Bible, and the search for a feminine or gender-transcendent divine. Christian feminists often draw on the teachings of other religions and ideologies in addition to biblical evidence, and other Christian based texts throughout history that advocate for women's rights. The term Christian egalitarianism is often preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the feminist movement.  History  Some Christian feminists believe that the principle of egalitarianism was present in the teachings of Jesus and the early Christian movements such as Marianismo, but this is a highly contested view by many feminist scholars who believe that Christianity itself relies heavily on gender roles. These interpretations of Christian origins have been criticized by secular feminists for \\"anachronistically projecting contemporary ideals back into the first century.\\" In the Middle Ages Julian of Norwich and Hildegard of Bingen explored the idea of a divine power with both masculine and feminine characteristics. Feminist works from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries addressed objections to women learning, teaching and preaching in a religious context. One such proto-feminist was Anne Hutchinson who was cast out of the Puritan colony of Massachusetts for teaching on the dignity and rights of women.Ellsberg, Robert. All Saints: Daily Reflections on Saints, Prophets, and Witnesses from Our Time The first wave of feminism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries included an increased interest in the place of women in religion. Women who were campaigning for their rights began to question their inferiority both within the church and in other spheres, which had previously been justified by church teachings. Some Christian feminists of this period were Marie Maugeret, Katharine Bushnell, Catherine Booth, Frances Willard, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. During the 1960s and the 1970s many evangelical women were influenced by the civil rights movement. Christian Feminists began writing and publishing articles that addressed reproductive rights as well as inequality in marriage and in the religious hierarchy. In response to these articles, groups such as the EWC or Evangelical Women's Caucus, and the ESA or Evangelicals for Societal Action were formed in order to create a social movement in the church towards equality, which was motivated by the Christian Feminist ideal that God created all people as equals.  Issues  = Women in church leadership = The division of Protestant belief systems into different sects allowed for women to acquire far more leadership positions in the church, as certain sects then had the freedom to advocate for female leadership. In both mainline and liberal branches of Protestant Christianity, women are ordained as clergy. Even some theologically conservative denominations, such as The Church of the Nazarene and Assemblies of God, ordain women as pastors. However, the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Southern Baptist Convention (the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.), as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and many churches in the American Evangelical movement prohibit women from entering clerical positions.SpringerLink - Journal Article Some Christian feminists believe that as women have greater opportunity to receive theological training, they will have greater influence on how scriptures are interpreted by those that deny women the right to become ministers. = Interpretations of gender based scriptures = Many of the Christian ideals concerning gender stem from interpretations of the Bible. Christian feminists have often argued that the Bible is problematic, not because of the text itself, but because of the Christian scholars who have interpreted the scripture throughout time. An example of these inconsistencies can be found in the creation story of Adam and Eve; some Evangelicals believe that Adam and Eve were created at the same time, while others believe that Eve was made from the rib of Adam. There is also wide debate within many Christian sects over the fault of Eve concerning the consumption of the forbidden fruit, and the entrance of sin into the world. Historically, a great deal of blame has been placed on Eve, but many Christian Feminists have worked to reframe the story, and shift the blame equally between both parties, as both partook of the fruit. The story of Adam and Eve is just one example of a text which Christian feminists believe is patriarchal in nature due to its interpretation. Some Christian Feminists made the decision to abandon direct scriptural use in their fight for equality, while others relied on verses that opposed patriarchal ideals, pointing out the inconsistencies within the Bible. The following passages act as examples of these inconsistencies. * . \\"There is neither‚Ä¶male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus.\\" * Deborah of the Old Testament was a prophetess and \\"judge of Israel\\"Deborah the Prophetess * . The word translated \\"help\\" or \\"helper\\" is the same Hebrew word, \\"ƒìzer,\\" which the Old Testament uses more than 17 times to describe the kind of help that God brings to His people in times of need; e.g., \\"Thou art my help (ƒìzer) and my deliverer,\\" and \\"My help (ƒìzer) comes from the Lord.\\" Never once in all these references is the word used to indicate subordination or servitude to another human being.\\"Ezer Kenegdo\\" Word Study. God's Word to Women, 2011 * . \\"To the woman he (God) said, 'I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. * . \\"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\\" * . \\"For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.\\" * . \\"The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says.\\" * . \\"Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.\\" * . \\"Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives.\\" * . \\"Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior. Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.\\" = Reproduction, sexuality and religion = Conservative religious groups are often at philosophical odds with many feminist and liberal religious groups over abortion and the use of birth control. Scholars like sociologist Flann Campbell have argued that conservative religious denominations tend to restrict male and female sexualityOrdaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations by prohibiting or limiting birth control use, and condemning abortion as sinful murder.Southern Baptist Convention Resolutions on AbortionSin of Abortion and the Reasons Why Some Christian feminists (like Teresa Forcades) contend that a woman's \\"right to control her pregnancy is bounded by considerations of her own well-being\\" and that restricted access to birth control and abortion disrespect her God-given free will. A number of socially progressive mainline Protestant denominations as well as certain Jewish organizations and the group Catholics for a Free Choice have formed the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.RCRC‚ÄîMember Organizations The RCRC often works as a liberal feminist organization and in conjunction with other American feminist groups to oppose conservative religious denominations which, from their perspective, seek to suppress the natural reproductive rights of women. In general, many Christian Feminist scholars hope to work towards a society in which female sexuality is not, in their opinion, condemned by the church, but acknowledged as a natural part of the human existence. During the Reformation, recognized theologians such as Martin Luther and John Calvin stressed the importance of chastity and marriage, leading to further repression of female sexuality within the Christian tradition. Many Christian Feminists have stated that men in powerful religious positions have often used the scriptures, and teachings from theologians such as Calvin and Luther to both dominate and repress women sexually, a problem which Christian Feminists believe needs to be solved immediately. Female Centered Depiction of the Birth of Christ = Feminine or gender-transcendent God = Some Christian feminists believe that gender equality within the church cannot be achieved without rethinking the portrayal and understanding of God as a masculine being. The theological concept of Sophia, usually seen as replacing or synonymous with the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, is often used to fulfill this desire for symbols which reflect women's religious experiences. How Sophia is configured is not static, but usually filled with emotions and individual expression. For some Christian feminists, the Sophia concept is found in a search for women who reflect contemporary feminist ideals in both the Old and New Testament. Some figures used for this purpose include the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, Eve, and Esther. Others see God as entirely gender-transcendent, or focus on the feminine aspects of God and Jesus. A female depiction of the Christ figure, known as Christa, recently arose in an attempt to allow for the power of the Christ figure to be applied to both the masculine and the feminine. Some Christian feminists use and promote gender-neutral or feminine language and imagery to describe God or Christ. Christian Feminists also call for a gender neutral reading of the Bible, as male pronouns are heavily used as compared to female pronouns throughout the text. The United Church of Christ describes its New Century Hymnal, published in 1995, as \\"the only hymnal released by a Christian church that honors in equal measure both male and female images of God.\\"  Opposing Views  = Roman Catholicism = Some women in the Catholic church believe \\"Radical Feminism\\" is the cause for the teachings of then Pope John Paul II to be seen as negative, though they believe that the Pope was taking great strides at the time to include women in the church and show their value. Some men in the Catholic church also had similar opinion on Pope Francis in an address and expressed \\"In an address Saturday to an Italian women's group, Pope Francis once again expressed a \\"vivid hope\\" that women will play a \\"more capillary and incisive\\" role in the Catholic church as well as in all the venues in which \\"the most important decisions are adopted.\\" Though other woman took Pope Francis quote, \\"‚Äúirreplaceable role of the woman in the family ‚Ä¶ [t]he gifts of -delicacy ‚Ä¶ which are a richness of the feminine spirit, represent a genuine force for the life of the family ‚Ä¶ without which the human vocation would be unrealizable\\", to heart and said that they believe he is only establishing what is already a norm in the Catholic church, which is usually that the women's role is a minor one.

Lake Corpus Christi was originally known as Lake Lovenskiold. It is often referred to as Lake Mathis because of its location. Geography It is an artificial lake owned by the city of Corpus Christi, four miles southwest of Mathis on the Nueces River at the intersection of the Live Oak, San Patricio, and Jim Wells county lines (at 28¬∞03' N, 97¬∞52' W). The lake has a conservation surface area of 19,336 acres, a drainage area of 16,656 square miles, and a conservation storage capacity of 269,900 acre-feet. It serves as a source of municipal water supply. Wesley E. Seale Dam, a seventy-five-foot-high earthen dam, was engineered by Ambursen Engineering and constructed by Henry B. Zachry. The resulting lake submerged the old Mathis Dam. In 1934 the state leased 288 acres surrounding the lake from the city of Corpus Christi for a park. Around the lake, flat to rolling terrain is surfaced by deep, fine sandy loam that supports hardwood forest, brush, and grasses. Uses Lake Corpus Christi provides drinking water for the city of Corpus Christi. The reservoir also provides good fishing opportunities, especially for largemouth bass and catfish. Lake Corpus Christi State Park provides camping and picnicking areas and two fishing piers. Camp Karankawa is a Boy Scout of America camp operated by the South Texas Council, opened in 1944. It's 130 acres on the shore of Lake Corpus Christi is leased from Lake Corpus Christi State Park on a 99-year lease. Camp Green Hill is a Girl Scout of America camp located on 50 acres on the lake operated by the Girl Scouts of Greater South Texas. Fish and Plant Species Lake Corpus Christi has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake Corpus Christi include crappie, white bass, catfish, and largemouth bass, sunfish, bluegill and Alligator gar. Plant life in the lake includes water stargrass, water lettuce, water hyacinth, American pondweed, coontail, rushes, and cattail.

The Genderarmerie originated from the Interior Troops of the MIA after the transition period from a socialist regime to democracy between 1989 and 1991. It was organised as a National Service \\"Gendarmerie\\", equal in status and independent from the National Service \\"Police\\". It was a militarized special police force, deployed to secure important facilities and buildings, to respond to riots, and to counter militant threats. Its agents are trained to operate in both urban and wilderness environments so as to be able to carry out a wide range of duties. For riot duty the commandos are equipped with Makarov 9x18 pistols, protective gear, gas grenades, police sticks and non-lethal weapons. When performing high-risk tactical operations they are armed with 5.45x39mm AKS-74U rifles, which are specialized versions of the original Kalashnikov assault rifle. The Gendarmerie was meant to be a force structure intermediate between the army and the police which has military status. The service members had military- style ranks from sergeant to colonel, following a system used throughout the Bulgarian police forces. The overall commander of the force was usually a Major General. The reform of the Ministry of Internal Affairs from 2012 has the service disbanded and its manpower and equipment absorbed into the Police with a change in the naming from Gendarmerie to Specialized Police Forces (, erroneously translated into English as Special Police Forces, which could be seen on some of the daily attire of its service members). The name change was reverted to Gendarmerie in 2014, but the service did not regain its separate status and it remained a part of the Main Directorate of National Police (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞ –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è \\"–ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ü–∏—è\\").  Current structure  After the latest reform of the service its members no longer hold military-style ranks, having transferred to the uniform ranking system of the police. At the head of the Gendarmerie is a Director with the two-star rank of a Senior Commissary, aided by a Deputy Director with the rank of a Commissary (corresponding to an army Colonel). * Central apparatus: ** Administrative and Training Sector ** Sector for Protection of Banking and High Security Institutions ** Sector for Organization of Protective Measures ** Commandature Sector * Territorial organization. Each zone department is headed by a Chief Inspector (Lieutenant- Colonel equivalent). The only exception is the ZGD Sofia, as it manpower almost equals the other seven ZGDs combined and is therefore headed by a Commissar (a Colonel equivalent): ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Sofia ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Pleven ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Plovdiv ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Montana ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Kardzhali ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Burgas ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Varna ** Zone Gendarmerie Department Gorna Oryahovitsa The Gendarmerie units are a high readiness operational reserve of the Bulgarian police, held centrally under the command of Main Directorate of National Police. Each of the provincial directorates of the National Police has a similarly equipped and tasked Specialized Police Forces unit and these number from over 530 (in Sofia's metropolitan police department SDVR) to as few as a squad of less than 10 people in most provincial ODMVR departments. These units are visually similar to the Gendarmerie and function in a similar manner, but locally for their respective territorial departments.

Their primary recital space is at the Dalhousie Arts Centre's Rebecca Cohn Auditorium.  History  Symphony Nova Scotia began in 1983 with 13 full-time musicians. Today it employs 37 musicians and ten administrative staff, along with over 150 contracted artistic, production and technical personnel. It has won four East Coast Music Awards for classical music. =Orchestral lineage= The first recognized orchestra in Nova Scotia, the Halifax Symphony Orchestra, was formed in 1897. This orchestra, led by conductor Max Weil, reached a membership of 39 musicians and performed four to five concerts each season. The orchestra disbanded in 1908 with Weil‚Äôs departure. In 1947 another orchestra was created in Nova Scotia through the efforts of Walter Kaufmann and Alfred Strombergs as well as Mariss Vetra and Dr. Srul Tulio Laufer. Backed by the Nova Scotia Opera Association, the orchestra primarily served as accompaniment for opera and ballet performances. Formally named the Halifax Sinfoniette in 1951, the group of 13 professional musicians was led by Strombergs until 1955. In 1955 the Sinfoniette became the second incarnation of the Halifax Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra began under music director Thomas Mayer with 17 full-time musicians (often augmented by members from the Royal Canadian Artillery Band and the Stadacona Navy Band). By 1966 the orchestra had 35 full-time members and presented about 70 concerts annually. Conductors included Jonathan Sternberg (1957‚Äì58), Leo Mueller (1958‚Äì64), and John Fenwick (1964‚Äì67). When the Halifax Symphony Orchestra and New Brunswick Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1962) were both disbanded in 1968, the Atlantic provinces created the 48-member Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, a regional orchestra designed to tour the four provinces. Despite the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra‚Äôs popularity, it suffered from high costs, declining government and corporate support, and a lengthy labour dispute in 1979. The orchestra declared bankruptcy in 1983. =Foundation= The logo of Symphony Nova Scotia In October 1983 Symphony Nova Scotia was created under the direction of conductor Boris Brott and Board president Brian Flemming. The original Symphony Nova Scotia hired 13 full-time players for a January‚ÄìMay season. In its second season the number of employed musicians doubled, and by 1987 the orchestra had grown to a complement of 39. Boris Brott is the only Canadian to be appointed music director of Symphony Nova Scotia. =Georg Tintner, 1987‚Äì1994= Austrian conductor Georg Tintner succeeded Boris Brott in 1987. Under his leadership, Symphony Nova Scotia made six recordings, toured to Ontario and Quebec, and initiated several community outreach programs, including a production of The Nutcracker in collaboration with Halifax Dance and Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia. The orchestra also raised $140,000 during a 1992 fundraising event called Pure Gold that featured violinist Isaac Stern and contralto Maureen Forrester. Tintner served as Symphony Nova Scotia‚Äôs principal conductor until 1994, and as Conductor Laureate until his death in 1999. =1994‚Äì1996= The orchestra struggled financially and artistically during a period of severe cutbacks in government funding. Despite attempts to cut costs by imposing wage freezes on the orchestra and staff and cutting the season to 27 weeks, by 1995 the Symphony was forecasting an accumulated deficit of $900,000. To address the immediate cash flow crisis, the Board of Directors, after consulting with staff and musicians, chose to restructure the organization rather than to shut the orchestra down. The orchestra members donated their services for two weeks during a provincial tour with a young fiddler from Cape Breton, Natalie MacMaster. The administrative staff was reduced and reorganized, and Raffi Armenian was hired as Interim Artistic Director until American conductor Leslie Dunner was chosen to take the podium in 1996-97. =1996‚Äì2000= In 1996-97 the orchestra opted to re-establish free public concerts and school visits, previously pared to save costs. 1998-99 was Dunner‚Äôs last season as Music Director with the orchestra, and a search began for a new conductor. With the death of Conductor Laureate and Artistic Advisor Georg Tintner in October 1999, orchestra, staff and Board members made artistic decisions until Simon Streatfeild was hired as Artistic Advisor in May 2000. =Bernhard Gueller, 2002‚Äì2018= Symphony Nova Scotia performs at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax German conductor Bernhard Gueller was announced as the new Music Director in July 2002 and began his inaugural season in September of that year. He served in the post until 2018. Gueller was assisted from 2005-2008 by the orchestra‚Äôs conductor-in-residence, Sri-Lankan-born Dinuk Wijeratne. In 2008, when Wijeratne had completed his Canada Council-funded term with the orchestra, Cape Breton native Martin MacDonald was appointed as the new resident conductor. MacDonald completed his term in May 2011, when Israeli-born Shalom Bard was selected as his successor. Jonathan Govias was then selected as resident conductor for the 2012-13 season. The orchestra has recently renewed a focus on touring, regularly traveling to communities across the province and incorporating a full concert series in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. It also participates in community engagement and outreach initiatives with partners from the educational, artistic, heritage and ethnic communities. The orchestra has been praised for its versatility and flexibility, and for performances in a variety of styles. Conductor and arranger Howard Cable calls Symphony Nova Scotia ‚Äúthe most versatile orchestra in Canada,‚Äù and the Chronicle Herald has said that: : \\"...they can play it all: Beethoven, Shostakovich, Hatzis and Current, as well as Tommy Dorsey, Scott Macmillan, Rose Cousins, Buck 65 and Natalie MacMaster.\\" =Recent history= In 2018, Holly Mathieson first guest-conducted the orchestra, as one of two finalist candidates for the post of music director. She returned in November 2019 for a further guest-conducting engagement. In December 2019, Symphony Nova Scotia announced the appointment of Mathieson as its next music director, effective January 2020, with an initial contract of 3 years. Mathieson is the first female conductor to be named music director of Symphony Nova Scotia.  Cross- over collaborations  Buck 65 (2006) Symphony Nova Scotia has collaborated with popular and folk music artists.

Engel was born in Lugau, Saxony, as the son of a Lutheran pastor. He attended the Universities of both Leipzig and Berlin, before receiving his doctorate from Leipzig in 1883. Engel studied under Felix Klein at Leipzig, and collaborated with Sophus Lie for much of his life. He worked at Leipzig (1885‚Äì1904), Greifswald (1904‚Äì1913), and Giessen (1913‚Äì1931). He died in Giessen. Engel was the co-author, with Sophus Lie, of the three volume work Theorie der Transformationsgruppen (publ. 1888‚Äì1893; tr., \\"Theory of transformation groups\\"). Engel was the editor of the collected works of Sophus Lie with six volumes published between 1922 and 1937; the seventh and final volume was prepared for publication but appeared almost twenty years after Engel's death. He was also the editor of the collected works of Hermann Grassmann. Engel translated the works of Nikolai Lobachevski from Russian into German, thus making these works more accessible. With Paul St√§ckel he wrote a history of non-Euclidean geometry (Theorie der Parallellinien von Euklid bis auf Gauss, 1895). With his former student Karl Faber, he wrote a book on the theory of partial differential equations of the first order using methods of Lie group theory. In 1910 Engel was the president of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung.

The Cathedral of Guarda () is a Catholic church located in the northeastern city of Guarda, Portugal. Its construction took from 1390 until the mid 16th century, combining Gothic and Manueline architectural styles. History The History of Guarda Cathedral begins in 1199, when King Sancho I obtained permission from the Pope to transfer the seat of the bishopric from nearby Egitania (Idanha-a-Velha) to Guarda. The first cathedral building, in Romanesque style, was soon substituted by another church built in the site occupied today by the Miseric√≥rdia Church in Guarda. This second cathedral, of modest proportions and built in the 13th century, was demolished in the second half of the 14th century when the city walls of Guarda were reinforced by King Ferdinand I during the wars with Castile. The third and definitive Guarda Cathedral started being built in 1390 under bishop Vasco de Lamego, during the reign of King John I. In the early 15th century the apse was built and the nave was begun in Gothic style. In this first stage the works were influenced by the Monastery of Batalha, which was being built at the same time. Construction on the Cathedral proceeded slowly during the second half of the century. Interior of the cathedral. The typical Manueline spiralling column is visible. In the period from 1504 to 1517, under bishop Pedro Gavi√£o, the pace of the works increased and the cathedral was almost completed. The architects of this phase were 'Pedro and Felipe Henriques. The Manueline style - a Portuguese mix of Gothic and early Renaissance - was the dominant influence in this second building stage, as attested by the decoration of the windows of the nave and transept, the decorated rib vaulting of the transept, some spiralling columns of the nave as well as the main portal, similar to the Manueline portal of Saint Michael's Chapel of Coimbra University. Most building activity in Guarda Cathedral was finished around 1540. Around this time, the Renaissance-style Pina Chapel was built as burial site for Jo√£o de Pina, treasurer of the cathedral. It has a Renaissance portal and a tomb with the recumbent figure of the sponsor of the chapel. Another important addition was the altarpiece of the main chapel, installed in the 1550s. This important Renaissance work was carved in stone by French sculptor Jo√£o de Ru√£o, one of the main sculptors from Coimbra. During the following centuries the cathedral was enriched with other elements. Despite the artistic value of some of these additions - like the Baroque organ - all were removed during a renovation carried out in 1898 by architect Rosendo Carvalheira, which aimed at restoring the cathedral to its primitive, Gothic/Manueline appearance.

The Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale was originally founded as an investment bank by William I of the Netherlands in 1822 when Belgium was under Dutch rule. After the Belgian Revolution in 1830, it served as the national bank until 1850. Its investments in the national economy contributed to the rapidity of the Industrial Revolution in the region. As a holding company, the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale exercised considerable indirect control over the Belgian and colonial economy. Various elements of the company, including its banking wing, were split off over the course of its existence. In the 1980s, Suez begun to buy up the company's shares and, in 1998, the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale was taken over by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux. It ceased to exist in 2003 when it was merged with Tractebel to form Suez-Tractebel. History As part of the terms of the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the countries of Europe agreed to augment their armed forces from militia to a standing army. Although Belgium had been offered independence by the Prussians, Lord Castlereagh vetoed it on the grounds that the country was too small to be economically viable, and the question then arose of who should govern it, the Austrians having washed their hands of it as a historical accident of the breakup of the Habsburg empire. Although William I of the Netherlands refused initially on the grounds of the added expense involved in maintaining the said army, Castlereagh persuaded him by asking him if he preferred to be Prince of Orange or King of the Netherlands, adding that from a practical point of view the Belgian Ducal Estates amounted to a third of the country. He therefore founded the company in 1822 to administer these estates under the name ' (\\"General Netherlands Society for Advantage to the National Industry\\"), with the overt goal of increasing the welfare of the country, but with the covert objective of covering these costs. As the Standing Army project never got taken seriously by the rest of Europe in practice, and the delivery of the Company proved insufficient, the objectives changed in 1826 to the delivery of a year as a \\"pension\\" to the King's personal account. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the company became Belgian, under the French name ', and it retained the Estates, which were sold off at low prices to the immediate circle of the Board. It then served until 1850 as the National Bank of Belgium. The ' was an important provider of capital for the upcoming industry of Belgium in the 19th century. In the years before the Second World War the company invested in roads, railroads and canals. It was also the main operation in the Belgian colony of Belgian Congo. After the 1929 Crash, the company split off its banking segment (1934), becoming the Generale Bank (now Fortis, which was later sold to BNP Paribas, resulting in BNP Paribas Fortis), but remained its largest stockholder.

The 14th century poem was translated into contemporary American English by Sanders, while Birk provided illustrations that adapt Gustave Dore's classic illustrations into 21st century imagery. Birk's illustrations were exhibited at the San Jose Museum of Art in 2005 and traveled to several institutions. The work was later published in three volumes. A feature film adaptation of the Dante project entitled Dante's Inferno was made by Birk and Sanders in collaboration with others. Starring the voices of Dermot Mulroney and James Cromwell as Dante and Virgil respectively, the film was featured at film festivals across the United States in 2007, garnering awards for \\"Best Director\\" at the Silverlake Film Festival and \\"Audience Favorite\\" at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival a.k.a.

The specific problem is the excess overshooting.  Solutions  This problem can be addressed by * Initialising the controller integral to a desired value, for instance to the value before the problem * Increasing the setpoint in a suitable ramp * Disabling the integral function until the to-be- controlled process variable (PV) has entered the controllable region * Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds * Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the process output within feasible bounds. * Zeroing the integral value every time the error is equal to, or crosses zero. This avoids having the controller attempt to drive the system to have the same error integral in the opposite direction as was caused by a perturbation.  Occurrence  Integral windup particularly occurs as a limitation of physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process saturation: the output of the process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any more open than fully open and also cannot be closed any more than fully closed. In this case, anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range. This usually occurs when the controller's output can no longer affect the controlled variable, or if the controller is part of a selection scheme and it is selected right. Integral windup was more of a problem in analog controllers. Within modern Distributed Control Systems and Programmable Logic Controllers, it is much easier to prevent integral windup by either limiting the controller output or by using external reset feedback, which is a means of feeding back the selected output to the integral circuit of all controllers in the selection scheme so that a closed loop is maintained. In addition, integral terms, in general, can have unwanted effects. Different situations may require different integral behaviors. For example, in a navigation system based on bearing and the error between target and actual bearings, the integral term has the desirable ability to correct the bearing after a deviation and restore the course (and not just the bearing) to the desired one. Conversely, a car speed cruise control should not attempt to equally balance errors in one direction with errors in the other. For example, a period of time spent below the speed set point should not be balanced by an equal integral above the speed set point. In this latter case, it is desirable to zero the integrator every time the error is zero or when the error changes sign. A convenient and robust method to determine when the error changes sign or is equal to zero is to multiply the current error by the previous error. (The previous error would be available if a derivative term is also being used.) If the product is zero or negative then the integrator should be zeroed.

In association football, a playmaker is a player who controls the flow of the team's offensive play, and is often involved in passing moves which lead to goals, through their vision, technique, ball control, creativity, and passing ability. In English football, the term overlaps somewhat with an attacking midfielder, but the two types of midfielders are not necessarily the same, as playmakers are not necessarily constrained to a single position. Several playmakers can also operate on the wings, or as a creative, supporting striker; some can also function in a more central midfield role, alternating between playing in more offensive roles and participating in the build-up plays in the midfield. Other players still function as deep-lying playmakers, in a free role, behind the midfield line. Playmakers are not usually known for their defensive capabilities, which is why they are often supported by a defensive midfielder. As many midfielders and forwards have the aforementioned creative and technical attributes, they tend to be the playmakers of a team. Advanced playmakers Attacking midfielder Diego Maradona (shirt number 10) right before scoring the \\"Goal of the Century\\" for Argentina against England in the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. The most complete and versatile playmakers are often known as advanced playmakers, or free-role playmakers, as they can operate both in central, attacking midfield positions, as well as in wider positions on the wings. The attacking playmakers are sometimes called the \\"number 10\\" of the team, as they often wear the number 10 jersey. The attacking midfield playmaker will sit in a free role between the midfield and the forwards, either in the centre of the pitch or on either flank. These offensive playmakers will often make incisive passes to the wingers or forwards, seeing them through on goal or to deliver killer crosses, as well as scoring goals themselves. They are also usually quick, agile, and highly technical players with good vision, shooting, passing, crossing and dribbling ability; they are known for scoring goals as well as providing assists, through-balls, and initiating attacking plays. In Italian football, as creative, technical, advanced playmakers are known not to be reserved to a single position, they are often described as the \\"fantasista\\" or \\"trequartista\\". In Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the \\"meia atacante\\", whereas in Argentina, it is known as the \\"enganche\\". In the English language, this position is sometimes colloquially referred to as playing \\"in the hole\\", as these playmakers often link the midfield and attack by essentially operating in the gap between the opposition's midfield and defence. Diego Maradona, Zico, Michel Platini, Marta, Pel√©, Zinedine Zidane, Roberto Baggio, Rui Costa, Michael Laudrup, Gheorghe Hagi, and Francesco Totti are some examples of footballers who have been fielded as advanced midfield playmakers throughout their career.\\"The Number 10\\". FIFA.com Deep-lying playmakers Deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo playing for Italy against England in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012. Deep-lying playmakers, who often wear jersey numbers 8, 6 or 5 (particularly in South American football), operate from a deep position, in or even behind the main midfield line in a seemingly central or defensive midfield role, where they can use space and time on the ball to dictate the tempo of their team's play and orchestrate the moves of the whole team, not just attacks on goal. Deep-lying playmakers are often known for their vision, technique and passing. Many are also known for their ability to switch the play or provide long passes that pick out players making attacking runs, as well as their striking ability from distance. Although several deep-lying playmakers are not known for their tackling, work- rate, or defensive skills, it has become more common for a box-to-box midfielder with good passing, technique, vision and ball-winning ability, such as Yaya Tour√©, to play in this role, since it is in a similar position to that of a defensive midfielder, and the role allows them to break down plays and subsequently create scoring opportunities themselves after winning back possession. In a 2013 article for The Guardian, writer Jonathan Wilson described this unique creative holding midfield role as that of a \\"creator,\\" citing Xabi Alonso as a typical example of player who operated in this position, noting that: \\"Xabi Alonso, although capable of making tackles, focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack like an old-style regista.\\" In Italy, the deep-lying playmaker is known as a \\"regista\\", whereas in Brazil, it is known as a \\"meia-armador\\". In Italy, the role of the regista developed from the centre half-back or centromediano metodista position in Vittorio Pozzo's metodo system (a precursor of the central or holding midfield position in the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì3 formation), as the metodista 's responsibilities were not entirely defensive but also creative; as such, the metodista was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball. Xavi, Andrea Pirlo, Luka Modriƒá, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Miralem Pjaniƒá, Jorginho, and Pep Guardiola are some more examples of players who operated as deep-lying playmakers throughout their careers.\\"The Question: What is a playmaker's role in the modern game?\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 31 October 2014 Other variants Luka Modriƒá is known for his ability to blend advanced playmaking with deep-lying positioning. Playmakers are not necessarily constrained to a single position; many attacking playmakers in modern football play a combination of these different attacking roles, often operating in a free position. Some playmakers can also function in a more central midfield role, or other can even be given the freedom to alternate between playing in more offensive creative roles and participating in the build-up plays and controlling the team's tempo in a deeper midfield position, such as Zinedine Zidane, N√©cib, or Juan Rom√°n Riquelme. Creativity, skill, vision, technique, tactical awareness and good passing ability are the true requirements of a good playmaker. With the increasing physical and athletic demands of modern football, it has also become increasingly common for midfield playmakers, in particular those who are known for their dynamism, ability to read the game, and work-rate off the ball, to play in deeper roles and be given more defensive responsibilities, in addition to their creative duties: midfielders such as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, and Paul Pogba often play in the centre of the pitch and occupy multiple roles, functioning both as box-to-box midfielders and creators, usually dropping back and helping to press opponents and win back possession, and then subsequently either carrying the ball forward, or dictating play and starting an attack with their vision, technique, and passing. According to Jonathan Wilson, Luka Modriƒá is another example of a midfielder who occupies multiple roles on the pitch; although he initially started out as an attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb, he was moved into a deeper central midfield playmaking role during his time with Tottenham, which enambled him to conduct the attack and create chances for teammates. He continued to play in a deeper midfield role in Real Madrid's 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 system. However, Wilson has noted that, although Modriƒá seemingly plays as a holding midfielder, he is \\"neither entirely destructive or creative\\", but a \\"carrier\\" who is \\"capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet\\", but in his case \\"with a hint of regista\\". =Winger= Ronaldinho ‚Äì pictured with Brazil at the 2008 Summer Olympics ‚Äì occasionally played as an inverted winger throughout his career. Advanced playmakers can also operate on the wings, in more of a wide offensive position, as a half- winger, inverted winger, or also as an outside forward, in a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 or a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. This position has become more common for offensive playmakers to carry out in recent years, as formations that employ a purely attacking playmaker, such as the 4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2/4‚Äì1‚Äì2‚Äì1‚Äì2, can often cause teams defensive problems when possession is lost, as attacking midfielders are not usually renowned for their defensive contribution, although modern playmakers are often more tactically responsible in this respect than classical playmakers. This position also allows players to take on defenders in one on one situations along the flank, cut inside to the centre of the pitch with the ball, and either shoot on goal with their stronger foot, or provide in- swinging lobbed passes or crosses. Lionel Messi, for example, who is naturally left-footed, was initially deployed in this position on the right under his former Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard, alongside the right-footed Ronaldinho on the left side of the pitch. Some playmakers, such as David Beckham, even operate as a wide midfielder in a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, using their vision to find teammates making runs, to whom they can then deliver long passes and curling crosses, although this position of a \\"pure winger\\" has become less common in modern formations. =Nine and a half= There are also other similar variants upon the advanced playmaking role. Other advanced playmakers seemingly operate as a free, creative second striker, or inside-forward, often playing on the wing, alongside a main striker, or even down the centre of the pitch, and then falling back into a deeper role to link up the midfield and the attack. Attacking midfielder/playmaker Michel Platini would describe this more advanced creative role (exemplified by Roberto Baggio) as a nine and a half (\\"nove e mezzo\\" in Italian), as it was halfway between the role of a goalscoring forward (shirt number 9) and a playmaking attacking midfielder (shirt number 10). This free position allowed these mobile, creative, and technical players, who were also often gifted with an eye for goal as well as good vision, acceleration, and ball skills, the freedom to burst forward suddenly and make dribbling runs, drop deep to lose their markers and pick up the ball, link-up with teammates, and score many goals themselves as well as assisting them. Unlike a pure number ten playmaker, however, the nine and a half/supporting forward does not usually participate in the build-up play as much as an attacking midfielder would. Their role is primarily that of an assist-provider, who can play one-twos as well as hold up and lay-off the ball for more offensive teammates. As the supporting forward initially originated from free-role attacking midfielders adapting to a more advanced position in the tactically rigorous 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formations of the 1990s, in which they were often paired up with a more physically gifted out-and-out striker, their defensive contribution is also usually higher than that of a pure number ten playmaker. In Italy, this role is known as a \\"rifinitore\\" or \\"seconda punta\\", whereas in Brazil, it is known as a \\"segundo atacante\\" or \\"ponta-de-lan√ßa.\\" =False nine= Lionel Messi has been a leading exponent of the false 9 position. A variation upon the deep-lying forward, more commonly known as a \\"false 9\\" also shares some similarities with the attacking midfielder role, although the false-9 player appears to be playing as a centre forward rather than as an attacking midfielder. A false-9 is often a quick, nimble, diminutive, creative, and technical player, with good vision, movement, positioning, and passing ability, as well as a penchant for scoring goals. The false-9, seemingly playing as a lone striker, will drop deep into the midfield number 10 role, drawing defenders with them, and creating space for other teammates to make attacking runs. This allows the false-9 space to dribble with the ball and score, or to provide other players running into the space they created with assists. Examples of false-9s are Lionel Messi under Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova and Gerardo Martino at Barcelona, Cesc F√†bregas with Spain under Vicente del Bosque, Francesco Totti at Roma under Luciano Spalletti and Rudi Garcia, and Roberto Firmino under Jurgen Klopp. This position is most common in a 4‚Äì6‚Äì0 formation disguised as a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 or 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. In Italian football jargon, this role is known as the \\"centravanti di manovra\\" (which literally translates to \\"manoeuvring centre-forward\\"). =False ten= Wesley Sneijder ‚Äì pictured playing for Inter Milan in 2010 ‚Äì has been deployed as a false 10 on occasion. In addition to their creative responsibilities while in possession, in the modern game, advanced playmakers are also given more duties off the ball than in the past, and are also required to have a higher defensive work-rate; as such, the role of the number 10 has changed in recent years, and formations that utilise a traditional advanced playmaker have become less common. In formations that still do employ an attacking midfielder, however, the number 10 role has instead been described as the \\"false 10\\" role (or sometimes it is even described as that of a \\"central winger\\"). The false-10 also shares similar attributes to a false-9, and is often used in a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. A false-10 is also usually a quick, offensive, technical and creative player, who is apparently playing in deeper role than a false-9 however, usually starting in the attacking midfielder position behind the striker, or occasionally as a winger, as the role is often interpreted by players who naturally play in these positions. As such, the false-10 is oten a more dynamic rather than static player, who is tasked with pulling opponents out of position with their movement; indeeed, the false-10 will often surprise defenders by moving out of position, drifting out wide, onto the wing, creating space for other players, in particular the full-backs and midfielders, to make attacking runs, either by overloading the flanks, or by drawing opponents out of position. The false 10 will then advance along the flank and provide deliveries into the box for teammates, or pass the ball to a free teammate who is exploiting the newly created space, either on the wing or in the centre. Defensively, they will often participate in their team's pressing game in order to help win back possession; they may also be tasked with finding gaps in the opposing defence and making late runs into the penalty box themselves. The false-10 can also function alongside a false-9 on occasion, in a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 (4‚Äì6‚Äì0) formation, or in a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward, or running on to passes from false-9s, leading to goals and assists. This role was effectively demonstrated by Wesley Sneijder and Mesut √ñzil during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. =False attacking midfielder= Leonardo Bonucci has often functioned as a ball-playing centre-back throughout his career. The false-10 (or false attacking midfielder) description has also been used in a slightly different manner in Italian football. The false attacking- midfielder is therefore usually a technical, mobile, and creative player with good vision, positioning, ball control and long passing ability, as well as being a player with respectable defensive attributes, and good long distance shooting ability. The false-10 performs in a similar manner to the false-9, although seemingly playing in the number 10 role, but still drawing opposition players back into the midfield. The false-10 will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a deep-lying playmaker, creating space for other players to make attacking runs and receive long passes from the midfield playmakers. =False winger= The \\"false winger\\" or \\"seven‚Äìand‚Äìa‚Äìhalf\\" is instead a label which has been used to describe a creative type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch, in order to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dictate play with their passing, dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, and create chances for their attacking teammates; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. Samir Nasri, who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a \\"non-axial playmaker.\\" =Playmaking in other positions= Sweeper It is also possible for a sweeper (or \\"libero\\", in Italian) to operate as a team's secondary playmaker; this position is often associated with former central defenders, such as Franz Beckenbauer, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Fernando Hierro, Aldair and Gaetano Scirea, who possessed good ball skills, vision, and long passing ability. Although this position has become largely obsolete in modern football formations, due to the use of zonal marking, players such as Daniele De Rossi, J√©r√¥me Boateng, Mats Hummels, Leonardo Bonucci, and David Luiz have played a similar role as a ball-playing centre-back in a three-man back-line. Their technique and ball-playing ability allow them to advance into midfield and function as a secondary playmaker for the team, in order to create goal-scoring chances when their team's primary deep-lying midfield playmaker is being heavily marked by the opposition. Sweeper-keeper German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is known for his distribution. To some limited extent, it is also possible for goalkeepers with good ball skills, vision, passing, long-throwing, and kicking ability to launch counter-attacks and create scoring opportunities; goalkeepers such as Ren√© Higuita, Fabien Barthez, Edwin van der Sar and most recently Manuel Neuer, Claudio Bravo, and Ederson Moraes for example, among others, are known for their adeptness with the ball at their feet, and their long passing accuracy from goal kicks; their playing style has led several pundits to dub them as \\"sweeper-keepers\\" or playmakers.Tim Vickery (10 February 2010). \\"The Legacy of Rene Higuita\\". BBC. Retrieved 11 June 2014 Qualities of a good playmaker Brazilian playmaker Marta is known for her technical skills in addition to her ability to score goals and create chances for teammates. Perhaps the most important quality of a playmaker is the vision and ability to read the game, and to get into good positions making for effective reception and distribution of the ball. Intuition and creativity are other key elements of a playmaker's game, as they need to know where different players are at different times, without taking too long to dwell on the ball. A good playmaker possesses good ball control, balance, technical ability, and dribbling skills, and will often hold possession, allowing other team members to make attacking runs. The ostensible role of the playmaker is to then provide or facilitate the final pass which leads to a goal. In football terminology, this is often known as a killer ball or the final ball, and is officially recorded as an assist. N√©cib ‚Äì pictured playing for France in a match against Austria in 2013 ‚Äì has drawn praise in the media for her elegance on the ball, as well as her vision and passing ability. Advanced playmakers are often known for their ability to score goals as well as their technical skills, passing, and chance creation ability. They are often ‚Äì but not always ‚Äì quick, agile, and mobile players, with good tactical intelligence; their movement off the ball is just as important as their movement on the ball, as they must create space for further attacking plays. Many playmakers are also free-kick, penalty, and dead-ball specialists, who are also capable of curling the ball into the box from set pieces, providing further deliveries for teammates, although this is not necessarily a trait that is required to be a playmaker. Playmakers and tactics =English football= English midfielder Steven Gerrard ‚Äì pictured playing for Liverpool during the 2006‚Äì07 season ‚Äì has played in a number of midfield roles throughout his career, including that of a playmaker. Classical number 10 and deep-lying playmakers are not often renowned for their tackling or defensive capabilities, hence English commentators have often seen them as a luxury in a football team, but they retain their places due to their ability to change games. Because of this, it became common in the past for box-to-box midfielders with good vision, tackling, tactical intelligence, passing and technical ability to play in the playmaker role in England, as shown by various coaches employing players such as Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Yaya Tour√© and Xabi Alonso in this position. In a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation, a playmaker will usually play alongside a defensive midfield player to ensure that the team is not vulnerable to attack. With different formations, however, a team may play with multiple playmakers. Most English teams usually use only one playmaker to minimize defensive frailties and also because using more than one may inhibit each playmaker's playing style. The downside to this approach is that a team lacks the necessary creativity when faced with a defensive opponent. Some contemporary teams using formations such as 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1, 4‚Äì4‚Äì1‚Äì1, 4‚Äì5‚Äì1, and 4‚Äì1‚Äì2‚Äì1‚Äì2/4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2, have multiple playmakers. Some examples of the few notable English players in this position are Paul Gascoigne and Glenn Hoddle, while most playmakers have tended to be foreigners in the Premier League. =Italian football= Carlo Mazzone and Carlo Ancelotti were known for having been able to adopt their formations to allow them to implement various playmakers into their starting formation. At Brescia, Mazzone moved Andrea Pirlo, originally an attacking midfielder, into the deep-lying role behind the midfield, whilst Roberto Baggio played the attacking midfielder role. For Milan, Ancelotti made a similar move, also employing Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, allowing Rivaldo or Rui Costa, and later Kak√°, to play as an attacking midfielder, whilst Clarence Seedorf and either Gennaro Gattuso or Massimo Ambrosini protected them defensively in Ancelotti's 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 midfield diamond formation. Due to the strength of Milan's midfield during his tenure with the club, Ancelotti was able to win several domestic and international titles. Marcello Lippi also utilised two playmakers during Italy's victorious 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign, fielding Francesco Totti in the advanced creative role behind the forwards, and Pirlo in the deep-lying playmaking role. The two playmakers were supported defensively by box-to-box midfielders, such as Daniele De Rossi, Gennaro Gattuso and Simone Perrotta; both Pirlo and Totti finished as two of the joint top-assist providers of the tournament. Italian attacking midfield playmaker Francesco Totti spent his entire career with Roma, also serving as the team's captain. Former Italy manager Ferruccio Valcareggi, however, devised a different strategy altogether, which allowed him to use two playmakers during his run to the 1970 World Cup final, where Italy would be heavily defeated by Brazil, however. Due to his focus on defensive stability, as well as the presence of two pure, prolific goalscoring strikers, Luigi Riva and Roberto Boninsegna, Valcareggi felt that it would not be possible to field Italy's two most revered advanced playmakers at the time, Gianni Rivera, and Sandro Mazzola, alongside each other. He believed the two creative players to be incompatible with each other, due to the rivalry between their respective clubs, and as he felt that deploying both players alongside the forwards would offset the balance within the starting line-up, in particular as Rivera, unlike Mazzola, was not renowned for his athleticism or defensive work-rate. He therefore conceived the infamous \\"staffetta\\" (relay) game-plan, which essentially consisted of Mazzola playing the first half of each match, whilst Rivera would play the second half; during Valcareggi's eight-year tenure with Italy, the national side only lost six matches. Despite Italy's victory at UEFA Euro 1968 and their second-place finish at the 1970 World Cup, the tactic was widely criticised by the media, in particular due to Italy's negative performance during the group-stage and in the final, despite demonstrating their ability to successfully apply a more offensive, exciting style of play with Rivera in the semi-final against West Germany. During the 1998 World Cup, Italy manager Cesare Maldini underwent similar widespread media criticism for employing a strategy reminiscent of the 1970 \\"staffetta\\" between Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero, who alternated occupying the creative second striker role, alongside an out-and-out striker or centre-forward (usually Christian Vieri or occasionally Filippo Inzaghi) in a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation; manager Giovanni Trapattoni was also initially criticised for not fielding playmakers Francesco Totti and Del Piero alongside each other during the 2002 World Cup. Sandro Mazzola playing for Italy alongside Gianni Rivera; the two playmakers would be involved in manager Ferruccio Valcareggi's infamous staffetta policy at the 1970 World Cup. During his run to the Euro 2012 final and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup semi-finals, the former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli also used several playmakers in his squad; he often deployed either Riccardo Montolivo, Alberto Aquilani, Daniele De Rossi, Antonio Nocerino or Thiago Motta in the false 10 playmaking role, as well as in other midfield positions, in his 4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2 formation; this formation was devoid of an authentic attacking midfielder, and was centred on the midfielders constantly switching positions. Prandelli's midfield was focussed on the creative playmaking of Andrea Pirlo and Montolivo in their deep-lying playmaker and false attacking midfield roles, with Pirlo seemingly being deployed as a defensive midfielder in front of the defense, in order to be left with more time on the ball, in an \\"inverted\\" midfield diamond (4‚Äì1‚Äì3‚Äì2). Pirlo was supported defensively by dynamic box-to-box midfielders, such as Claudio Marchisio and De Rossi, due to his lack of pace or notable defensive ability. The space created by the movement of Montolivo as the false 10 allowed quicker, more offensive minded midfielders, such as Marchisio, to make attacking runs in order to receive Pirlo and Montolivo's long passes from the midfield, whilst the second striker Antonio Cassano would drop out wide onto the wing or into the attacking midfielder position to link up the play between the attack and midfield. As well as functioning as a playmaker, and creating space, in the false 10 role, Montolivo was also able to alleviate the pressure placed upon Pirlo in the deep lying playmaker role, by supporting him defensively and providing Pirlo and the team with a secondary creative option. Although Helenio Herrera's famous catenaccio tactics during the years of \\"La Grande Inter\\" in the 1960s were primarily thought to be associated with defensive yet effective football, creative playmakers played a fundamental part in Inter Milan's success during this period. Herrera and former Grande Inter players, including Mazzola and Facchetti, would state that they felt the Grande Inter side to be more offensive than it was often made out to be, and that imitators of Herrera's catenaccio tactics had often replicated his pragmatic style of football imperfectly. Luis Su√°rez (formerly an offensive playmaker who had first flourished under Herrera's more fluid, offensive tactics at Barcelona) was the primary creative force of Herrera's Inter side, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his ball skills, vision and passing range. Sandro Mazzola, in the role of a winger, attacking midfielder, inside-right or supporting striker, and Armando Picchi in the Libero or sweeper position, would also function as secondary playmakers at times, as well as left-winger Mario Corso. Aside from the strength of the almost impenetrable defence, some of the key elements of Herrera's Inter side were the use of vertical football and very quick, efficient and spectacular counter-attacks, which would lead to goals being scored with very few touches and passes. This was made possible due to Herrera's use of very quick, energetic, offensive, two-way full-backs to launch counter-attacks, such as Giacinto Facchetti, and Tarcisio Burgnich. Spanish midfielder Luis Su√°rez was the main playmaker of the Grande Inter side of the 1960s under manager Helenio Herrera. The quick, energetic technical wingers (Jair da Costa and Mario Corso) and offensive midfielder/supporting striker (Mazzola), would also occasionally move into deeper positions to support the midfield creatively and defensively, leaving the fullbacks with space to attack, which frequently caught the opposing teams by surprise. In Herrera's flexible 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 formation at Inter, four man-marking defenders were tightly assigned to each opposing attacker while an extra sweeper would recover loose balls and double mark when necessary. Under Herrera, most frequently during away matches in Europe, the highly organised and disciplined Inter players would usually defend by sitting patiently behind the ball, often leading to very closely contested victories. Upon winning back possession, Picchi, usually a traditional and defensive minded sweeper, would often advance into the midfield, and occasionally play long balls to the forwards, or, more frequently, carry the ball and play it towards Luis Su√°rez, whose playmaking ability played a crucial role in Inter's adeptness at counter- attacking football. Due to Su√°rez's outstanding vision and passing ability, he could quickly launch the forwards or full-backs on counter-attacks with quick long passes once he had received the ball, usually allowing the fullbacks to advance towards goal and score, or to help create goal-scoring chances. Under Herrera, Inter won three Serie A titles (two of them won consecutively), two consecutive European Cups and two consecutive Intercontinental Cups, and he was given the nickname \\"Il Mago\\" due to his success and tactical prowess. =Spanish football= Spanish playmaker Xavi playing for Barcelona in 2012. During his highly successful spell as the head coach of Barcelona, Pep Guardiola was able to incorporate several skillful players with playmaker qualities into his team, such as Xavi, Andr√©s Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Cesc F√†bregas and Lionel Messi, through the use of his personal variation on tiki- taka tactics, allowing the team to move the ball around, switch positions, create space by making attacking runs, and retain possession. His use of heavy pressing in his 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formation gave each player defensive responsibilities when possession was lost. Guardiola also frequently deployed Messi in the false-9 role, which was particularly effective due to the frequency of attacking runs made by the Barcelona players, as well as their disciplined positioning, team-work, vision, technical skills, creativity, and passing ability, which allowed Messi to create and score several goals. Vicente del Bosque also incorporated similar tactics (such as the use of tiki-taka, heavy pressing and the false-9 in a 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 or 4‚Äì6‚Äì0 formation) during his successful run of reaching three consecutive international finals as Spain's manager, between 2010 and 2013, winning the 2010 World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. His tactics allowed several playmaking midfielders, such as Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Andr√©s Iniesta, David Silva, Juan Mata and Cesc F√†bregas, to function together effectively.

He has been portrayed by Eric Braeden since 1980. Initially a guest character who was to last for eight to twelve weeks, Victor has evolved into the soap opera's leading male figure. Created by William J. Bell as a \\"despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\\", the character was planned to be killed off and never heard of again. However, after Bell saw Braeden's performance, he decided to sign the actor onto a contract. Braeden was hesitant to work on a soap opera, but eventually signed a contract, and has remained on the series as a regular cast member for a total of 40 years. The character is widely described as a ruthless villain, while loving to those he holds dear. Over the years, he has also been the center of several controversial plots and relationships. Victor arrived in Genoa City, Wisconsin for business, and he eventually formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises. After his first marriage to Julia Newman (Meg Bennett), he formed a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Their union developed into a supercouple pairing, which has lasted over three decades. He shares two children with Nikki, Victoria (Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). During his first marriage to her, he cheated with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). He has also had a long-standing romantic history with Ashley, and they share a child together, Abby Newman (Melissa Ordway). He was briefly married to a woman named Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) and they had a son together, Adam Newman (Justin Hartley), who grew up without knowledge of Victor being his father. He is also known for his long-standing business rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Victor has had several other romantic relationships, including one with his former daughter-in-law Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), which was poorly received by the actors and public. Considered an icon and leading man of the soap opera genre, Braeden's distinct performance of Victor has garnered widespread praise from critics, who have described him as legendary and \\"enthralling\\". Victor is famously characterized for his power-hungry ways and low-toned voice. Because of the character's popularity, he was made a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers. Apart from popularity and critical praise, Braeden has also garnered numerous accolades for his performance; most notably a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, presented to him in 2007. He has been nominated at the Daytime Emmy Awards eight times for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, having won the award in 1998. He has been pre-nominated three times in this category. Additionally, he was the recipient of the \\"Favorite Male Performer in a Daytime Serial\\" award at the 18th Annual People's Choice Awards in 1992. Casting and creation William J. Bell created Victor as a short-term non- contractual role, debuting on February 8, 1980. Bell stated in 1997, \\"[Victor] would last between eight to twelve weeks, at which time he was to be shot by his wife.\\" However, once he saw Braeden's performance, he thought \\"the voice, the power, the inner strength\\", and knew he didn't want to lose the actor; \\"The first thing was to get Eric under contract, but he didn't want to go under contract\\", he said. However, Braeden was uneasy about the daytime soap opera genre, admitting years later he thought it was \\"too confining\\"; although soon signed a six-month contract. Bell immediately changed Victor's storyline to salvage, redeem and develop the character. Development =Characterization= Eric Braeden stated that Victor always uses money to get what he wants. William J. Bell created Victor as a \\"despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\\". The soap opera's official website notes: \\"Victor is loving and protective toward family and loved ones, but if crossed, or if Victor feels that one is not living up to one's full potential; then he can more than live up to the adjective that many have used to describe him ruthless.\\" The Los Angeles Times characterizes him as \\"charming but complicated\\", while others publications have described him as a villain, as well as an evil, powerful and ruthless character. Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that Victor is a male chauvinist. Although he is often considered malicious, Braeden stated that \\"Bill Bell was a very wise man\\" and that \\"he created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also a man who can be affectionate and loving and forgiving\\". Shelly Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press described Victor in 2009, stating: Fralic also described the character as being \\"quixotic\\", who is \\"deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued with all the failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible not only for the death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning\\". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but \\"like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration\\". Braeden describes the character as \\"the villain\\" and as \\"defensive and always self-protective\\", stating that he's \\"not here to win a popularity contest\\". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor \\"more than anything\\", also describing him as \\"very complex\\". Braeden said that \\"he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago\\", and that \\"he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood.\\" The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: \\"Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character.\\" In June 2011, Michael Logan of TV Guide felt that Victor was \\"pushing it with the fans\\", stating: \\"The megalomaniacal patriarch earned considerable viewer backlash last month when he threw his ex-wife [Diane] from the back of an ambulance and left her bruised and bloodied.\\" In an interview with Logan, Braeden stated that Victor \\"doesn't give a shit\\" and \\"he doesn't take any shit\\", saying that is \\"the whole point of the character\\". The actor also stated he does not like women defeating Victor, admitting that he wasn't pleased in a 2003 scene where his daughter Victoria (portrayed by Heather Tom) slaps him. =Relationships= Melody Thomas Scott portrays Nikki, Victor's main love interest for over three decades. Their union has registered \\"an enduring appeal\\" among viewers. For over three decades, Victor has been romantically linked with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. They fall in love and have a child, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and later a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the soap opera media. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed their characters to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle, which is a take on the original supercouple formula. Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact, described as an \\"inspired decision\\", led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple. In an interview with Dose magazine, Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge. Victor and Nikki are recognized as one of daytime television's most prominent couples. They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed \\"Niktor\\" by viewers. In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Scott has said: \\"Let‚Äôs face facts: Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they‚Äôve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold.\\" In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had \\"registered an enduring appeal among viewers\\", with Braeden replying that, \\"Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from the wrong side of the tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict.\\" In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he \\"always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki\\". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: \\"Young and Restless' Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [the writers] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them.\\" The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: \\"Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years.\\" They also described their relationship as being a \\"dominant force\\" in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: \\"Victor and Nikki just can‚Äôt, we mean can‚Äôt, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship.\\" Aside from Nikki, Victor is known for his relationship with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her. This led to Ashley's pregnancy, and Victor left Nikki. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton. Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he left town and Ashley tracked him down when nobody else could. They reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided to like the storyline as it was unexpected. Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child. Victor was noted for his controversial relationship with both of his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to \\"find herself\\". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor \\"in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father and more like a hero\\", also stating that Victor is Sharon's \\"security blanket\\". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps in Depth that he was \\"always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad\\", and that \\"there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger\\". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, \\"We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it.\\" Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said that the relationship \\"hasn't worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!\\" In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, she thought he was abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline \\"a million other ways\\" without \\"marrying him [Victor]\\". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: \\"Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do [personal appearances], the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!\\" When asked if the marriage was about \\"daddy issues\\", Case said: \\"That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!\\" Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was \\"almost like an inside joke\\". =Departure and return= In 2009, Braeden experienced multiple contract negotiation issues, leading to former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) out of the series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts in the middle of already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: \\"When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?\\" In another interview with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: \\"It's not that one hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money.\\" Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused to say that he had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: \\"We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been an important part of the Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next.\\" Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was \\"very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us\\". Storylines =Backstory= Victor Newman was born Christian Miller on March 7, 1947 in Buffalo, New York. He was put in an orphanage by his mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), when he was seven years old. His father was Albert Miller. By the time he was a teenager, he left the orphanage and started to work his way through to becoming one of the world's wealthiest tycoons. He changed his name to \\"Victor Christian Newman,\\" Victor standing for \\"victorious\\" and Newman standing for \\"new man,\\" as he was a completely new man. In 1970, Victor married Julia Newman (Meg Bennet) as he began to develop a strong business reputation. =1980‚Äìpresent= In 1980, Victor and his wife Julia move to Genoa City to help Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) run her company, Chancellor Industries. Julia felt neglected by Victor and sleeps with her photographer, a man named Michael Scott (Nick Benedict). Victor created his own company, Newman Enterprises, and ended up cheating on Julia as well, with Eve Howard (Margaret Mason) and later Lorie Brooks (Jaime Lyn Bauer). Julia became pregnant and it is assumed that it was Michael's child; Victor attacks him and Julia loses the child, revealed to actually have been Victor's. Eve later has a child, Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), believed to be Victor's son. Julia and Victor divorce and she leaves town with Michael, just as Victor begins a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Having been from the lower walks of life, Victor teaches Nikki about society. He later takes over the Prentiss family company, Prentiss Industries, and they scheme to get it back by using Lorie to seduce Victor into a marriage. On their wedding day, Victor signs the company back over to them and Lorie stands him up. Victor then tries returns to Nikki, who recently married Kevin Bancroft. Nikki ended up pregnant with Victor's child, but she ended up being manipulated into a marriage Tony DiSalvo to save her relationship with Kevin. Nikki later gives birth to a daughter named Victoria Newman (Ashley Nicole Millan). Nikki also later got involved with a man named Rick Daros, who nearly killed her before being saved by Victor. Eve Howard returns with her boyfriend, demanding that money be allocated to Cole in Victor's will, and later takes a job as his assistant, which prompts Julia to return to protect Victor. He planned to marry Eve but faked his death on the day of their wedding, and ends up marrying Nikki in April 1984. The following year, while Victor and Nikki are vacationing, Eve reappears with Rick, and they end up stealing money from them and escaping. Nikki facilitates Victor's reunion with his mother, Cora Miller, before her death. Despite loving Nikki, Victor begins to fall for Ashley Abbott (Brenda Epperson) and they have an affair, enraging Nikki to sleep with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Ashley's brother and Victor's business rival. Ashley becomes pregnant and Victor leaves Nikki, but when Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, Victor returns to her and Ashley aborts the child. When Nikki goes into remission, Victor wanted to be with Ashley, who had moved on with her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants); Steven later dies, and while Ashley wanted Victor back, he had returned to Nikki in an attempted to salvage their marriage, resulting in the birth of their son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Victor and Jack later hire Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor, when in reality, Jack wanted the book to be a tell-all expos√© on Victor. Leanna later writes a chapter about Victor's affair with Ashley and Nikki's illness, causing Victor to believe Nikki was behind the publication. He divorces her and marries Leanna to prove to the press that he didn't want to be with Ashley; their marriage was invalid, as the divorce wasn't finalized. Victor later takes over Jack's family company, Jabot Cosmetics, replacing him with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). As a result, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, causing her relationship with Victor to become bitter. Victor marries Ashley, and years later; he tells Jack that he will give him back Jabot Cosmetics if he divorces Nikki. He agrees to do so, but Jack wasn't given full control of the company due to a legal loophole. Victor has a heart attack during a confrontation with Jack, and while he leaves him for dead, Victor recovers. As Jack and Nikki's marriage strained to due her alcoholism and pain killer addiction, she reconnected with Victor, who had decided to divorce Ashley. Eve later returned to town again with her now-grown son Cole, who romanced Victor's daughter Victoria, unaware he was believed to be Victor's son. Victor later left Genoa City and traveled to Kansas, letting Nikki and the rest of the Newman family believe he had died. He meets Hope Adams (Signy Coleman). They returned to Genoa City and married. While Victor was in Kansas, Cole and Victoria had eloped, and when Victor revealed their sibling relation, the marriage was annulled. However, when Eve died, it was revealed that Cole was never Victor's son; Victoria and Cole remarry. Victor and Hope later have a son, Victor Adam Newman Jr. Hope wanted to return to Kansas and Victor was not interested; he divorced her and Victor Jr. was raised without knowing Victor was his father. Nikki had been engaged to Brad, much to Victor's dismay. On their wedding night, Victor was shot and Nikki returned to him; the mentally unstable Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton) was revealed as the gunwoman. Victor and Nikki briefly reunite before he returns to Kansas after Hope's new husband, Cliff Wilson, had died. In 1997, Victor marries Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley), Jack's ex- girlfriend. Nikki had Victor have a vasectomy, but had frozen sperm for a future possibility. Nikki later marries Joshua Landers (Heath Kizzier), and in 1998, she is shot by Joshua's ex-wife, Veronica Landers (Candice Daly); Victor divorces Diane to marry Nikki on her deathbed, promising to remarry Diane after Nikki's death. When Nikki survived, their second marriage was invalidated, as Victor and Diane's divorce was never processed. Victor and Diane begin a bitter divorce over many months, during which Nikki reunites with Brad, and he and Jack take control of Newman Enterprises. Diane remained in love with Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor's sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she'd stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor's actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad's child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry in front of all of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor's daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor's estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises. Victor later falls in love with Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), but she dies in a car accident with Nikki's devious husband, David Chow. Victor travels to Mexico and nearly dies, and Ashley is able to find him; they end up rekindling their romance. They remarried when Ashley became pregnant, but she miscarries when Adam gaslights her into having a hysterical pregnancy, but convinced her that she was still pregnant. Despite Adam stealing Nicholas‚Äô daughter, Faith, and passing her off as Ashley's, she and Victor divorce as he reunites with Nikki again. Victor was later shot by Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) and needed a heart transplant, receiving Colleen Carlton‚Äôs (Tammin Sursok) heart. Victor and Nikki left for treatment in Europe, and upon their return, Adam's scheme was revealed and he faked his death. Victor went searching for him in Canada and met Meggie McClaine (Sean Young); he brings her to Genoa City and she works as Nikki's assistant, but causes her to relapse into alcoholism. In reality, Meggie was trying to foil Victor and Nikki's union to marry him for his money. Victor marries her, but has her arrested soon after; Nikki moves on with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). Afterward, Victor's children file a lawsuit against him over a cosmetics line, which they win. Diane (Maura West), who had returned to Genoa City, reconnects with Victor and they remarry, however, it is annulled shortly after she finds him sleeping with Nikki and Victor learns of her affair with Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) and Jack. Afterward, Victor sends Nikki to a rehabilitation center for her alcoholism. Diane is murdered in August 2011, with Victor as a suspect. Nikki in fact murdered Diane in self- defense, causing Victor to falsely confess to murdering her to protect Nikki. While in jail, Victor marries his former daughter-in-law, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to push Nikki away, however when the entire murder plot is revealed, Nikki is not charged and Victor is freed. Victor and Sharon's marriage is annulled and he reunites with Nikki, however, she leaves him when some of his past schemes involving Victoria's marriage are exposed. To gain control of the cosmetics line Beauty of Nature, Victor slept with Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis). When Nikki reunites with Jack, Victor develops a genuine romance with Sharon to spite her. They marry a second time, however he disappears from town shortly after and Sharon believed he was abandoning her. She burned their prenuptial agreement and took over Newman Enterprises, while Jack and Tucker were buying up its stocks. While away, Victor had lost his memory and was working as a dock worker in Los Angeles; he was demanding better working conditions and the other workers planned to have him killed in an explosion, as a result, Genoa City believed Victor had died, but he returned shortly after. Upon his return, he annuls his marriage to Sharon and reunites with Nikki, just before Jack announces he is taking over Newman Enterprises, firing all of the Newman family and instating Adam. However, due to his addiction to pain killers, Jack gave up control of the company, leaving it to Adam. Victor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 just before she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming to take back the company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries to get him out of town. It was later revealed that Victor had hired a lookalike to his granddaughter Cassie, named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to haunt Sharon and learn a supposed secret she has. When his scheme is revealed, Nick and Sharon shun him and Nikki decides to move out for a while, but she and Victor later reunite. Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family confused as to why he gave Chancellor up so easily. In 2015, Victor has Jack kidnapped and replaced by a lookalike, who turns out to be a Peruvian drug lord named Marco Annicelli, all for him to take over Jabot Cosmetics and merge it with Newman, becoming Newman Abbott Enterprises. Meanwhile, Victor and his children discover that Nikki has fallen off the wagon; they convince her to quit drinking again and she and Victor end up reuniting. Jack makes his way back to Genoa City just as Victor learns that Marco is dangerous; he plans on shooting Marco dead in the park, but it is actually Jack who he ends up shooting, who had finally returned to confront him. Jack ends up falling comatose while Victor frantically tries to get rid of Marco, who continues to masquerade around town. When Jack awakens, he reluctantly agrees to help Victor get Marco out of town and back in prison, which they end up doing successfully. With the real Jack back in Genoa City, the Newman Abbott merger comes to an end and both companies return to their separate states. Meanwhile, Adam, who had returned to town under the false identity of Gabriel Bingham, had teamed up with Ian (who had escaped prison) to create a computer virus to destroy Newman Enterprises for separate revenge on both their parts; the virus was known as the Paragon project, which later led to the revelation that \\"Gabriel\\" is in fact Adam. He agrees to stop Paragon, but Ian makes no such promise; on Halloween, when a party was being thrown in the Newman Enterprises ballroom, Ian is responsible for the building catching fire and a great panic ensuing. As a result, Ashley and Billy (Burgess Jenkins) offer to share office space at Jabot with Newman while the Newman building is being repaired, but Victor refuses to trust them. It is later revealed that Billy revived Paragon as an act of revenge against Victor, leading to Jack firing him and Victor filing a lawsuit against Jabot. Reception and legacy Chris Jancelewicz of The Huffington Post described Victor as \\"the very definition of daytime TV icon\\" and noted that, \\"Even people who have never seen an episode in their lives know his name, his face, and his powerful low voice.\\" In the early 1990s, he was described as a . He is credited as being one of the soap opera world's leading stars. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it considers Braeden the soap opera's leading male. Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood stated that Braeden \\"is known in the industry as the biggest daytime leading man of all time\\". In 1993, Nancy Reichardt of The Los Angeles Times stated: \\"Victor Newman is one of those characters. When Eric Braeden first came on the show in the role, Victor was a villain, and what a villain! His portrayal proved so dynamic that this \\"minor\\" plot point has been ignored over the years. Today, Braeden is one of the show's leading men. The character has never lost his edge, but his knife-wielding days are long forgotten.\\" In 1997, The Museum of Television and Radio wrote that with the arrival of the character, who was an \\"enigmatic stranger popular with women\\", \\"the show's revived tableau was complete\\", saying it was an \\"amazingly seamless transition\\" and praised William J. Bell for the character's introduction. Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment wrote of Braeden's tenure: \\"Eric Braeden first signed onto The Young and the Restless in 1980 for a mini-stint as a baddy, but stayed on to change the game in Genoa City forever, becoming one of daytime's most recognizable forces on and off screen.\\" In 2010, Global News wrote that, \\"From the early days of The Young and the Restless, Victor Newman has been a symbol of power in Genoa City.\\" Braeden's biography at Yahoo! notes that upon his casting as the ruthless businessman Victor, he \\"clicked with both the audience and the creative powers, and has been one of the series leading men for close to two decades\\". Kim Muraro of LimeLife stated that instead of his originally planned three- month stay at the series, he \\"has become one of the most iconic characters in daytime TV\\". Garrett, writing from Canyon News, wrote: \\"[Braeden] plays the mastermind mogul with real gusto. His innate acting skills are as legendary as his distinguished career. This week, we saw Braeden play ruthless, conniving and ultimately a loving father.\\" Good News Weekly wrote: \\"There are some men that are larger than life. There are some men that transcend the TV screen. There are some men that touch the lives of millions of viewers. Victor Newman is one of those men.\\" In 2005, Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Braeden has transformed the character into a \\"global phenom\\". BuddyTV noted the storyline where Victor locked his wife Julia's lover in a bomb shelter as \\"the turning point\\" in the character's life, making him a villain. The character of Victor has been used as a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers and appeared in an advert for it. The commercials aired in November 1998. In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of the television screen, praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign \\"has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community ‚Äì and small wonder. Not only does it perform the considerable task of balancing an affordability message with strong branding, it does so in a category seldom noted for the quality of strategic thinking that goes into its advertising.\\" Victor's pairing with Nikki has received positive reviews from critics throughout the years; The News & Advance cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered \\"epic\\" of the early supercouple era. Global News wrote of their long-standing relationship, \\"Victor is the consummate womanizer and has been a part of many relationships over the years. Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication.\\" In 1990, The Washington Times wrote that, \\"Victor Newman's sudden marriage to Ashley Abbott fooled us all.\\" In 1995, Sports Illustrated wrote of Victor's marriage to Hope, saying a \\"man with that much power could have married anyone, but he fell in love with a blind woman. Not for what she is, but who she's about.\\" In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was \\"keeping it real\\" with Victor and Nikki's third wedding. Upon their fourth wedding in 2013, the magazine stated: \\"Say what you will about Victor (and we‚Äôve all said a lot), but the ol‚Äô boy definitely knows who is best for him ‚Äî Nikki.\\" On Victor's rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: \\"After all, their characters' on screen feud has been the stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other.\\" Additionally, Waldman wrote: \\"Braeden's contribution to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic\\" but \\"like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers crazy with his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and you have made him completely compelling for 30 years.\\" In another article, Waldman called Braeden one of the biggest stars in the soap opera business. Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes \\"The Mustache\\" and \\"The Dark Night\\". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), for the first time since he was seven years old. The actor credited it as the turning point of his career on the show, describing it as \\"a deeply-felt scene\\" and something he would never forget. He said: When asked during the same interview why he believed Victor had so much commercial appeal, Braeden responded: \\"I really don't know. I've always been a very emotional actor, in other words, the only criterion I go by when I film scenes is to make them as believable and real as possible. Maybe it's that. Maybe ‚Äì and I'm not sure if there's any truth to this ‚Äì but people can perhaps sense that I've seen a lot in my life. I've been through a lot, and maybe for that reason I can feel empathy.\\" Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood also compared his performance to his portrayal of John Jacob Astor IV in the 1997 film Titanic, stating that the performances are \\"equally enthralling\\". A writer from The Age describes Victor's voice as \\"gravel\\". Toby Goldstein of The Orlando Sentinel stated that Victor is one of the characters contributing to the soap opera's longtime popularity. Shelley Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press named Braeden along with Susan Lucci (who portrayed Erica Kane on All My Children) to be the soap opera genre's biggest icons. Fralic stated that he is the \\"eye of the Genoa City hurricane\\" and that \\"the thought of Y&R; without Victor Newman ‚Äì his character is recovering from a heart transplant and was going to \\"disappear\\" to Belgium for rehabilitation ‚Äì is hard to imagine, rather like Dallas without J.R. Ewing, or The Sopranos without Tony.\\" Notes See also *Victor and Nikki Newman *List of soap opera villains References  External links  *soapcentral.comY&R; Online *Website that covers UK screening of Y&R; *New York Times Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1980 Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Victor Newman"},{"id":"5686388","text":"is one of the traditional forty throws of Judo as developed by Jigoro Kano.

It opened on July 29, 1981 and is located at the intersection of Sam Rittenberg Boulevard (SC Hwy. 7) and I-526. The mall features more than 100 stores, including four anchor stores: the area's largest Belk and Dillard's department stores, Dick's Sporting Goods, and the region's first Target that was recently remodeled to include a new \\"Fresh Grocery\\" section. On September 1, 2013 the mall went into foreclosure after then owner CBL & Associates Properties defaulted on mortgage payments and it was purchased at auction by the lender in January 2014. After the auction, the mall was placed under the ownership of a holding company formed by the lender, 2070 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard Holdings LLC and as of January 2017 was under contract to be sold to an undisclosed buyer. History The mall opened in 1981 as a project of national mall developer Jacobs, Visconsi & Jacobs of Cleveland, Ohio. Citadel Mall is located at the intersection of Sam Rittenberg Boulevard (S.C. Highway 7) and Savannah Highway (U.S. Highway 17) at the junction of Interstate 526 in the heavily commercialized West Ashley suburb of Charleston, South Carolina. At the time of its opening, Citadel Mall was anchored by Sears which relocated from a free-standing location in Downtown Charleston at Calhoun and St. Philip Streets, Belk, which shuttered a 1950s store in Pinehaven Shopping Center in North Charleston and relocated to the mall, and Thalhimer's, an upscale Richmond, Virginia based department store chain new to South Carolina owned by Carter Hawley Hale Stores. Jacobs, Visconsi & Jacobs later became The Richard E. Jacobs Group in the 1990s. The first major change at the mall occurred in 1992 when it was announced that Thalhimer's, now owned by the May Department Store Company would be folded into the Hecht's Department Store chain and the Charleston location would be sold to Dillard's. Dillard's operated in the space for two years before moving to a newly constructed larger building at the mall in 1994. Dillard's sold the former Thalhimer's building to JCPenney, which remodeled the space and operated there until 2001 when it was sold to Target and torn down, replaced by a newly constructed one-story building for Target. Belk relocated its original mall store into a newly constructed larger two-story building next to Dillard's, selling its old building to Parisian in 2000. When Belk bought the Parisian chain in 2006 from Saks Incorporated and folded the Parisian chain into Belk, the Parisian store at Citadel Mall was closed since Belk already operated a location at the mall. The building was sold to JCPenney, who returned to the mall in 2007. The Richard E. Jacobs Group added a Food Court and completely remodeled the mall's interior in the early 2000s. Shortly thereafter, Jacobs divested the majority of its mall portfolio and sold Citadel Mall to CBL & Associates Properties. CBL added a sixth anchor store to the mix in 2005 - Dick's Sporting Goods on an outparcel next to the mall's freestanding six screen AMC Theatres. On April 8, 2008, AMC Theatres announced that it was closing its Citadel Mall Cinema 6 after the final showing on Sunday, April 13, 2008. AMC also announced plans to close its Northwoods Mall Cinema 8 on the same date. The cinema was originally built as a part of the General Cinemas chain which later was sold to AMC Theatres. General Cinemas had announced plans to demolish and replace the Citadel Mall Cinema 6 with a huge new multiplex featuring stadium seating and Dolby surround sound to be built on a vacant parcel of land behind the existing cinemas. With the sale to AMC these plans never materialized. On April 12, 2008 it was announced that the property was acquired by Southeast Cinema Entertainment of Charlotte, North Carolina. It was reopened temporarily until September 2008 when the current cinema building was demolished. It was replaced by a state of the art sixteen screen megaplex known as Citadel Mall IMAX Stadium 16 with several screens dedicated to art films and featuring stadium-style seating. The new IMAX megaplex opened October 2, 2009. The mall was prominently featured in an episode of The Food Network's popular program \\"Food Court Wars\\" hosted by famed chef Tyler Florence that was taped at the mall in June 2013. The show pitted two couples against one another for the chance to win a lease of a vacant food court space at the mall for a year. On September 10, 2013 The Post & Courier reported that US Bank National Association filed foreclosure proceedings against Citadel Mall's owners Citadel Mall CMBS LLC, a subsidiary of CBL & Associates Properties in Charleston County Court and had plunged the mall into receivership. Spinoso Real Estate Group of N. Syracuse, NY was retained to manage the mall by the court appointed receiver and continued managing the mall for the holding company that purchased the mall at auction. Spinoso Real Estate Group aggressively marketed the mall and successfully attracted new tenants during the period in which the mall was under bank ownership. Citadel Mall is seen as a highly attractive property due to its central location and visibility at the convergence of two major highways and an interstate and the fact that it has 6 successful anchor tenants and a new state of the art IMAX cinema complex. It was announced on February 24, 2017 that the mall was purchased for $17 million by TMP SRE 1, LLC, a limited- liability company of local business persons led by managing partner Richard C. Davis who is noted for developing and starring in the first season of A&E;'s \\"Flip This House\\" reality television series. The new owners have indicated that they intend to upgrade the mall's tenant mix to better suit the area while also adding entertainment and mixed-use elements including the construction of a multi-story travel sports facility attached to the mall. Former management company Spinoso Real Estate Group has been replaced by the new ownership and the property is now managed by JLL - Jones Lang LaSalle. On March 17, 2017, JCPenney announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 138 stores nationwide. The store closed on July 31, 2017. The JCPenney building was purchased by a subsidiary of the mall's new owners for $5.2 million and has been leased to the Medical University of South Carolina for a 20-year lease. It will undergo a $32.9 million renovation and conversion into a MUSC outpatient medical facility to include a musculoskeletal service line, ambulatory surgery center, imaging, patient services and support. On May 3, 2018, Sears announced that it would also be closing in August 2018 as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. Within days of the news of the closure, it was subsequently announced that the mall's owners had acquired the Sears property for $7.55 million. They stated that the acquisition of the Sears parcel was the final piece of a three-step process to transform the mall \\"into something more grand and consistent with the West Ashley revitalization plan.\\" As a part of the planned upgrades and renovations Citadel Mall will also be renamed EPIC Center. Since 2019, HBO leases the 132,000-square-foot Sears store for principal photography for its television series The Righteous Gemstones.

(1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. It is usually found in shallower water than the white water lily, and often in beaver ponds. Since the flooded soils are deficient in oxygen, aerenchyma in the leaves and rhizome transport oxygen to the rhizome. Often there is mass flow from the young leaves into the rhizome, and out through the older leaves.Dacey, J. W. H. (1981). Pressurized ventilation in the yellow water lily. Ecology, 62, 1137‚Äì47. The rhizomes are often consumed by muskrats. The flower is solitary, terminal, held above the water surface; it is hermaphrodite, 2‚Äì4 cm diameter, with five or six large bright yellow sepals and numerous small yellow petals largely concealed by the sepals. Flowering is from June to September, and pollination is entomophilous, by flies attracted to the alcoholic scent. The flower is followed by a green bottle-shaped fruit, containing numerous seeds which are dispersed by water currents. The species is less tolerant of water pollution than water-lilies in the genus Nymphaea.  Taxonomy  Some botanists have treated Nuphar lutea as the sole species in Nuphar, including all the other species in it as subspecies and giving the species a holarctic range,Beal, E. O. (1956). Taxonomic revision of the genus Nuphar Sm. of North America and Europe.

Biography =Early life= John Morris was born on 15 July 1745. He was the son of Robert Morris (d.1768) and Margaret Morris (n√©e Jenkins) who in later life lived in Tredegar.Thepeerage.com citing Burke's Peerage, 107th Ed., 2003, Wilmington, Volume 2, page 2778. Robert was a Shropshire entrepreneur who had come to Swansea in 1724 to supervise the Llangyfelach Copper Works, founded in 1717, and had taken control of the works when the owner, John Lane, was declared bankrupt in 1726. John Morris had four older siblings: Robert (a barrister born 1743, a supporter of the radical politician, John Wilkes, who died unmarried c. 1797), Bridget, Jane and Margaret, who as Margaret Desenfans became one of the co-founders of the Dulwich Picture Gallery. =Morriston= The family expanded their copper-smelting and coal-mining interests in the Tawe valley throughout the remainder of the eighteenth century. John Morris initiated in 1768 the building of the planned village of Morris Town (today the northern part of Swansea, Morriston), including 'Morris Castle', to house the company's workers. With a growing population by the 19th century, tin- plating became a major industry. In 1806 he was created a baronet, of Clasemont in the County of Glamorgan. Clasemont was their home in the Clase or Cl√¢s part of Morriston which had been taken down before 1849 when the locality was summarised by topographer Samuel Lewis.'Cl√¢s, Upper and Lower', in A Topographical Dictionary of Wales Samuel Lewis (London, 1849), pp. 241-248 accessed 14 March 2015 =Family= His father died in 1768. In 1774 John married Henrietta Musgrave, one of five daughters of Sir Philip Musgrave, 6th Baronet who married. In 1776 his sister Margaret Morris married the Frenchman, Noel Joseph Desenfans; they and Francis Bourgeois would eventually build up an art collection which became the basis of the collection at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. Morris had five daughters, three of whom survived into adulthood and each married: *Henrietta ‚àû Sir Nathaniel Levett Peacocke. *Caroline ‚àû Rev. George Fauquier *Matilda ‚àû Mr. Edward Jesse. Their children included historian John Heneage Jesse and author and activist Matilda Charlotte Houstoun. His younger son gained an M.A. but is not recorded by Burke's Peerage as having had any children. His older son married the daughter of the 5th Lord Torrington and continued the male line - he had a Navy Commander and General among the less senior of his four sons and the title devolved from one branch to another to a Morris descendant of the Commander living in Georgetown, Ontario. He died on 25 June 1819, aged 73.

In other words, the formal qualities that make up our consciousness a priori ‚Äî given as the conditions through which we experience things ‚Äî conditions such as time, space, causality and number, and, indeed, the laws of physics, however we may then conceptualize them, are given to us both in our own physical nature, and in the physical nature of the environments we inhabit, through our growth from and interactions within these environments. = The three categories of nature's a priori and the \\"eccentricity\\" of human intentionality = From Husserl and Scheler, Plessner adapted the idea of the intentionality of consciousness away from the need for a transcendental ego or apperception and instead grounds it in the behaviour (in the broadest sense of the term) of environmentally interactive organisms as a realizing of borders that represents the point where the impulses or growth of organisms meet with their environments, are realized in the act of self-positioning. These are the scopes of action and understanding that define consciousness and which at the same time ground it in the material world of nature. In terms of plants, their self-expression is utterly open‚Äîtheir borders are defined by only very simple forms of feedback, and the plant has no ability to express intentional preferences regarding its environment; animals, on the other hand, are aware of their own borders and are constantly pressed back within them, thus exhibiting a closed kind of intentionality trapped by its own borders, this is the limit of their expression; finally, humans alternate between open and closed intentionality ‚Äî we are these borders, but also, we have them, and the limits of these borders of human action, influence and being Plessner described as the eccentricity of human intentionality in its environmental relations and determination. For Plessner, our own subjectivity can be understood in terms of the expressive a priori in nature, and our experience of and relationship to it.

All issues were smaller (in page count and eventually in size) than normal and at one point printed in an oblong format. None were sold. The series was published as a \\"giveaway\\" premium and sold to vendors who would stamp their name on it (or arranged for their logo to be printed on the cover) and given away to children who shopped at their store. A prominent outlet for the series was through shoe departments at Sears stores. No publisher logo was on the cover. It was published under Western's \\"K.K. Publishing\\" subsidiary through the mid-1960s, then by just Western. Many of the characters published by Western for Dell Comics and their own Gold Key Comics, both licensed and original, appeared in the comic. Characters published included Walt Disney characters, Warner Brothers characters, Walter Lantz Studio characters, Tarzan, Our Gang (with art by Walt Kelly), Little Lulu, and Western's own Turok and Space Family Robinson. Issues of the March of Comics series are typically harder to find for collectors than other comics published in the same period, given their method of distribution and as a giveaway more prone to be thrown away by recipients (or their parents). The three most sought-after March of Comics issues are those featuring long Donald Duck stories by Carl Barks.

Soon, however, he became a trapper for a variety of companies.

Meek moved to Oregon in 1835 and began working at the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Vancouver for John McLoughlin. This included trips to California with Tom McKay. In 1841, Meek bought the first lot of the Oregon City, Oregon, townsite from John McLoughlin and helped to survey the land. He joined the American mountaineers that year for one year. The following year he served as a guide for a wagon train of pioneers to the Willamette Valley from Fort Laramie, and in 1845 led the ill-fated group that followed him from the Oregon Trail on the Meek Cutoff. That party split from the main party that included Joel Palmer and Sam Barlow at Fort Hall. In May 1845, he married Elizabeth Schoonover at St. Louis, Missouri, with whom he later had one son, George. The Meeks would reside at Linn City, Oregon, until 1848. Later years Meek would later spend time in the mines of the California Gold Rush before settling in Siskiyou County, California. In 1850, he briefly returned to Oregon, before returning to California continuing to mine until 1865. In 1865, Elizabeth died, and he returned to working as a guide and trapper.

It first appeared on Sinatra's album Movin' with Nancy, the soundtrack to her 1967 television special of the same name, which also featured a performance of the song. It was subsequently released as a single before appearing on the 1968 album, Nancy & Lee. Elemental and enigmatic ‚Äî the mystery of Some Velvet Morning Construction The male part of the song is in 4/4 time signature whereas the female part is in 3/4. Lee's voice is recorded with more reverberation than Nancy's, making it sound bi-dimensional. The recording session Nancy Sinatra after the makeover recommended by Hazelwood Sinatra's singing career received a boost in 1967 with the help of songwriter/producer/arranger Lee Hazlewood, who had been making records for ten years, notably with Duane Eddy. Hazlewood's collaboration with Nancy began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help boost his daughter's career.Elemental and enigmatic ‚Äî the mystery of Some Velvet Morning Sinatra joined Hazelwood at Capitol Studio in Los Angeles in the fall of 1967 for a three hour session. The recording was produced by Hazelwood while Billy Strange was the arranger. According to one review, overdubbing was not used. Instead, the duo \\"recorded the entire song live with the band, the full orchestra and Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra singing all at the same time\\".Some Velvet Morning, by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra Interpretation of the lyrics Every reviewer has their own take on the meaning of the song. A British journalist said that \\"the puzzle of its lyrics and otherworldly beauty of its sound offering seemingly endless interpretations\\".Elemental and enigmatic ‚Äî the mystery of Some Velvet Morning Lee Hazelwood's was less definitive than some others'.Some Velvet Morning, by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra > \\"It‚Äôs not meant to mean so much. I‚Äôm not a druggie, so it was never to do > with that\\" [but added that he was inspired by Greek mythology]. \\"I thought > they were a lot better than all those fairy tales that came from Germany > that had killings and knifings. There was only about seven lines about > Phaedra. She had a sad middle, a sad end, and by the time she was 17 she was > gone. She was a sad-assed broad, the saddest of all Greek goddesses. So > bless her heart, she deserves some notoriety, so I‚Äôll put her in a song.\\" In 2003, London's The Daily Telegraph called the song, \\"One of the strangest, druggiest, most darkly sexual songs ever written - ambitious, beautiful and unforgettable.\\"\\"50 Best Duets Ever: Some Velvet Morning, 1968\\" The Telegraph, 8 November 2003 As with many psychedelic songs, its overall meaning is somewhat obscure. The lyrics consist of the male part describing a mysterious, powerful woman named Phaedra, who \\"gave [him] life ‚Ä¶ and ... made it end\\". The male part alternates with the female part, who identifies herself as Phaedra and speaks over ethereal, twinkling music about beautiful nature imagery and about the secrets held by an unknown collective \\"us.\\" The rhythm shifts from 4/4 for the male parts to 3/4 for the female parts. Chart performance Although \\"Some Velvet Morning\\" is one of the more famous duets Hazlewood and Sinatra recorded together, it is considered a departure from their usual fare, as it is decidedly less influenced by country and western music. The single peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1968. Legacy * In November 2003, music critics working for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph placed the Sinatra/Hazlewood single at the number 1 spot in their list of the \\"50 Best Duets Ever.\\"The Telegraph, 8 November 2003 According to Nathan Rabin: \\"These two weirdly complementary sides of Hazlewood‚Äôs persona unite on 'Some Velvet Morning,' a standout track from Nancy & Lee. On that track, Hazlewood and Sinatra sound like they don‚Äôt inhabit the same universe, let alone the same song. Over loping spaghetti-Western guitar, Hazlewood sings of Greek mythology and ‚Äúsome velvet morning when I‚Äôm straight,‚Äù while Sinatra coos about flowers and daffodils in a stoned haze against a backdrop of bubblegum psychedelia. ‚ÄúSome Velvet Morning‚Äù sounds like two songs spliced together by a madman, or an avant-garde short film in song form.\\" * In August 2006, music critic Rob Mitchum awarded the duet the 49th spot on Pitchfork's list of the 200 greatest songs of the 1960s, saying \\"Even after thousands of listens, I still don‚Äôt know quite what to make of this bizarre, creepy song. A country-outlaw singer drowning in a pool of reverb, constantly interrupted by dazed-hippie interludes, and haunted by a storm cloud orchestra.\\" * In December 2015, Rolling Stone rated the song as Number 9 in their 20 Greatest Duos of All Time retrospective.20 Greatest Duos of All Time * In 2017, Britain's Financial Times recalled the recording as \\"part rugged country, part fey folk, cloaked in psychedelia by Billy Strange‚Äôs haunting orchestration, will echo down the years\\". The author of the piece also reminded readers that Hazelwood had recorded the song again, shortly before his death. \\"On his 2005 swansong LP Cake or Death, he duets it with his grand-daughter ...

It connected New York City and Albany along the east side of the Hudson River, a service now performed by U.S. Route 9 (US 9). History The Post Road followed the original Wickquasgeck Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its Native American inhabitants. This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island. Upon the arrival of the Dutch, the trail soon became the main road through the island from Nieuw Amsterdam at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur David Pietersz. de Vries gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 (\\"the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily\\"). The Dutch named the road \\"Heerestraat\\". In 1669, the provincial government of New York designated a postal route between New York City and Albany, the colony's two most important settlements at the time. It was little more than a narrow path in many places, following old trails used by the Wiccoppe and Wappinger tribes. Stagecoaches headed north originally started from Cortland Street in lower Manhattan; later the starting point was moved up to Broadway and Twenty-first Street.Hine, C.G., The New York and Albany Post Road, 1905 In 1703, the legislative body provided for the postal road to be a \\"public and common general highway\\" along the same route, starting in Kingsbridge, Bronx and ending at a ferry landing in present-day Rensselaer. It was called the Queen's Road, after Queen Anne. The King's Bridge was built as a toll bridge in 1693, by Frederick Philipse, a wealthy merchant and major landholder in the Bronx and Westchester. The bridge, the first connecting Manhattan with the mainland, spanned the former Spuyten Duyvil Creek at what today is Kingsbridge Avenue. At Kingsbridge the Post Road split with the eastern spur heading to Boston, and the northern branch heading to Albany. The Albany Post Road, still called \\"Broadway\\", continues to Van Cortlandt Park, through what was once called the \\"Vale of Yonkers\\", and passes Greystone, the former estate of Samuel J. Tilden, now part of Untermyer Park. The village of Ardsley takes its name from the estate of Cyrus W. Field, who owned 780 acres (3.2 km2) of land lying between Broadway (Dobbs Ferry) and the Sprain Brook (Greenburgh) named Ardsley Park. He had named Ardsley Park after the English birthplace of his immigrant ancestor, Zechariah Field (East Ardsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England), who immigrated to the U.S. Just north of Washington Irving's Sunnyside is the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow featured in his \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" (1820). Running concurrent with U.S. Route 9, the Albany Post Road drops the name \\"Broadway\\" as it approaches the village of Ossining. In early autumn 1777, General Israel Putnam retired along the Post Road in the face of Sir Henry Clinton's advance on Peekskill. The rough route was as follows: *US 9, New York to Ossining (split from the Boston Post Road in Kingsbridge) *Old Albany Post Road and New York State Route 9A (NY 9A), Ossining to Peekskill *Sprout Brook Road and Old Albany Post Road, Peekskill to near Nelsonville *US 9, near Nelsonville to Wappingers Falls *Main Street and NY 9D through Wappingers Falls *US 9, Wappingers Falls to Poughkeepsie *South Avenue and Washington Street (partly NY 9G) through Poughkeepsie *US 9, Poughkeepsie to Humphreysville [mid-way between Livingston and Claverack]. *NY 9H and Hudson Street, Humphreysville to Kinderhook *Albany Avenue, Old Post Road, US 9 and Old Post Road, Kinderhook to Schodack Center, where it met the road from Boston to Albany *US 9/US 20, Schodack Center to Greenbush, ending at \\"the ferry at Crawlier\\" Minor old alignments exist all along the current through route.

Their name is a pun of \\"soul (music)\\" and \\"sold out\\". The group is sometimes referred to by their initials, S.O. On 30 January 2014 it was announced via their official Facebook page, that SOUL'd OUT would disband after their final album \\"To From\\" is released on 9 April 2014. Biography =Diggy-MO'= Diggy-MO', the lead MC for SOUL'd OUT, acquired a foundation of music through several years of classic piano training. In middle school he formed a band which was heavily influenced by the hip-hop group The Roots. Diggy-MO' attended a university of fine arts to major in graphics, but he continued to dabble in music. In SOUL'd OUT, he, along with Bro.Hi, writes the lyrics for the music, and he composes and arranges a good number of works for the band. He is classified as a rapper, but he often sings in his songs, especially his solo works, which are not as heavily hip-hop and urban based as SOUL'd OUT's works are. He launched his first solo effort, the single Bakusou Yume Uta, on 2008 November 26. It was used as the 3rd ending theme of the anime Soul Eater. Diggyism, his debut solo album, hit shelves on 2009 March 25. His last solo single before reuniting with SOUL'd OUT, Stay Beautiful, was announced as the 23rd ending theme of the anime series Bleach, and was released on 2010 May 12. The follow-up album, Diggyism II, came out on 2010 July 7. =Bro.Hi= Bro.Hi is the beat box/MC for SOUL'd OUT. During middle school, he formed a band and manned the drums. While seeing The Roots, Bro.Hi experienced his first exposure to the method of the human beat boxing. Afterwards, he began to polish the skills in human beat boxing. With Soul'd Out, Bro.Hi helps to write the lyrics and performs backup MC. Artists who influenced Bro.Hi are The Roots, RZA, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, Nas, Naughty By Nature, Lauryn Hill, TLC, Aaliyah, Zhane, The Who, The Doors, Janis Joplin, The Jam, Inoue positive water, DJ Krush and Utada Hikaru. Bro.Hi also formed his own rock group with a fellow DJ and rapper by the name of Kay, named EdgePlayer. Their debut mini-album is called In Humanity. On 2009 September 2 they released their first official single, Nagarete. They released their second album, Twisted, on July 21, 2010. =Shinnosuke= Shinnosuke is the DJ for Soul'd Out. He studied oil painting and design in high school. While in elementary school, Shinnosuke began playing the trombone, forming a brass band, and also played the keyboard. After graduating high school, he started making his own original music which came from observing Jam & Lewis. Later, he looked towards DJing music. Along with Diggy-Mo, Shinnosuke composes Soul'd Out's music and helps in the arrangement process as record producer. Shinnosuke cites P-Diddy, the TrackMasters, Timbaland, The Neptunes, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Teddy Riley, Bernard Edwards & Nile Rodgers, Babyface, TJ.Kura, Rodney Jerkins, Tim & Bob and Prince as his influences. As a solo artist he goes under the name S'capade. His debut album S'capade was released June 6, 2010.

As a republican, Dresselhuys opined that the abdication of Beatrix in 2013 should have been seized to abolish the Dutch monarchy. Although she was quite content with M√°xima's efforts for the emancipation of women thus far, it was unjust how her position as the king's wife was subordinate, despite her misleading style of 'Queen'.

The United States Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded Northrop Grumman a US$10.3 million contract for risk reduction and preliminary planning for an X-plane oblique flying wing demonstrator.G. Warwick - Flight International, Num 5029, Vol 169, Pg 20. The program aimed at producing a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails. The proposed aircraft would be a purely flying wing (an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails, canards or a fuselage) where the wing is swept with one side of the aircraft forward, and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion.Oblique Flying Wing This aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance.Oblique Flying Wing, Supersonic Aerodynamics The program entailed two phases. Phase I explored the theory and result in a conceptual design, while Phase II would have resulted in the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs. Flight of the Switchblade was scheduled for 2020 with its 61-meter long oblique wing perpendicular to its engines like a typical aircraft. As the aircraft increased speed, the wing begins to pivot, so that when it breaks the sound barrier, its wing has swiveled 60 degrees, with one wingtip pointing forward and the other backward. The change in aerodynamics and the general structure would have made the aircraft very difficult to control for a human being. The plane was to be totally controlled by an on-board computer controlling flight parameters. Following Phase I the aircraft concept was cancelled in 2008.Wired.com-DARPA kills Switchblade History Both Messerschmitt and Blohm + Voss aircraft companies worked on the asymmetric wing concept at the end of World War II. The Blohm & Voss P 202 and ME P.1109 were their initial attempts at implementing this concept. From 1979 to 1982, NASA successfully flew the piloted AD-1 demonstrator aircraft which validated the oblique wing concept.

The plot centers on a group of young adults who are stranded in a desert oasis where they fall prey to a horrific decaying creature. Plot A family is driving down a desert highway when they hit a deer. The dad gets out and comes back with half his face gone. The family is attacked by something. In a lavish apartment, Trip meets with a dealer, Radford, who provides him with pills for a rave in the desert. When Radford leaves the room, Trip steals all of the pills. He meets with his friends Cookie, Nelson, Jack (who is blind), and Gretchen. The group then stops at a diner where Trip, not believing Jack is really blind, jokingly tricks him into using the women's restroom. When he realizes his mistake, Trip admits to Nelson that he stole the drugs he currently has, and Nelson reminds him how insane this dealer is, explaining he's even killed someone before. Trip simply passes it off as a legend. The dealer then calls Trip on his cellphone and says he is aware he stole the drugs because he caught him on his computer webcam and says he wants the drugs back, and Trip agrees to meet with the dealer at Area 52, Kelton in 2 hours or they're all dead. The group then leaves the diner. The group notices an overturned car on the highway, which they dismiss as an abandoned accident. Gretchen discovers that Trip is carrying drugs and stops the vehicle to kick him out. While parking at the side of the road, the group notices a short, but strong tremor. Gretchen agrees to take Trip back to the diner, which has been abandoned. The car runs out of gas and breaks down, so they decide to stay at the Halfway Motel next to the diner. Learning from the radio that the highway has been closed, Trip decides to walk down the road for help. Jack and Gretchen pitch camp outside. After a close call with the drug dealer Radford at another stop, Trip escapes and meets a man named Henry driving an RV, who is looking for his missing wife. He goes with Trip to the motel and sets up camp there. Trip doesn't tell his friends about his run-in with Radford, but warns them to be careful. Looking for signal reception for his mobile phone, Trip releases from a rubbish skip the still-living head, torso, and arms of a truck driver, who then crawls away. Henry then meets Trip and discovers they both are seeing the dead people. While in his camper, Henry collapses, seemingly suffocating as a dark figure moves through the trailer. Still looking for reception, Trip is attacked on the roof by a hooded figure. Cookie is killed while sitting in an outhouse by being dragged into the hole. Nelson is almost dragged under his bed, but pulls himself back up and jumps on top of the bed. He takes his sneaker off and drops it on the ground, watching as it is shredded. He then tries to escape by jumping through the window, but fatally cuts his throat on a shard of glass. Gretchen and Jack discover Nelson's and Henry's bodies, prompting Gretchen to look for Trip and Cookie. Jack encounters the creature but escapes when Trip, who has lost an arm, shoots at the figure with his gun. Trip is overpowered by the creature and dies. In reality, an RV crashed into Gretchen's car after Trip stepped out to call for a ride, at the moment when they experienced the tremor. None of the group had noticed the RV, whose driver was Henry. His wife, Rose, explained to the officers on the scene that Henry suffered a heart attack and lost control. The car that the group saw leaving the diner was, in fact, their own. Each of the deaths at the hotel were reflected by their own deaths in the car: Cookie died from internal bleeding; Nelson cut his neck when he was thrown through the windshield; Trip's arm was severed gripping the cell phone, and he died from blunt force trauma. Gretchen survived the crash because she was wearing her seat belt and Jack, despite receiving a massive head injury and a broken arm, also remained alive in the car. Radford, who had been stalking Trip, witnessed the accident and attempted to assist; hence the visions of him at the motel and highway. In the final scene, Gretchen and Jack briefly discuss the fact that neither has any recollection of the accident, and no mention is made of the incidents at the motel.

Variety critic John Anderson wrote called it a \\"glossy, gory takeoff on the teensploitation slasher flick that might just shock skeptics by scaring up crossover success.\\" Peter Bradshaw from The Observer gave the film a negative review, awarding the film 1 out of 4 stars, stating, \\"You'd be a millionaire if you had a pound for every low-budget horror like this in existence, photographed like this, in this desert locale, and with this ending\\". Kim Newman from Empire Magazine awarded Reeker 4 out of 5 stars, praising the film's characterizations, and well used setting, old fashion monster.

A blend of century-old cottages and modern houses, surrounded by the rolling farmland which typifies the Overberg region of South Africa, give the village a rural atmosphere. Napier is situated in the Cape Agulhas Region with easy access to the seaside villages of Arniston/Waenhuiskrans, Struisbaai and L¬¥Agulhas. History Napier was founded in 1838 through a dispute between two neighbours, Michiel van Breda and Pieter Voltelyn van der Byl, over the location of the community church. Michiel van Breda wanted the church sited on his farm, Langefontein, while Pieter Voltelyn van der Byl wanted it built on his property, Klipdrift. Neither van Breda nor van der Byl would give way, so churches were built in both places, the town of Bredasdorp growing around van Breda‚Äôs church and the town of Napier founded around Van der Byl‚Äôs church, and being named after Sir George Thomas Napier, the British governor of the Cape Province at that time. The Feeshuis, one of the oldest buildings in the town, was used as slave quarters during 1810‚Äì1820, and then later as a wine cellar, was restored in 1988 to celebrate the town's 150th anniversary. The Dutch Reformed church was built in the form of a Greek cross with teak interior, unique with a beautiful pipe organ made of solid yellow copper. The sundial was erected by Danie du Toit in 1965, who had no training in this field but gained his knowledge through meticulous observation. Time can be read from it, accurate to within 30 seconds. Tourism Top Attractions include various art galleries, a giant sundial at the municipal offices, and an Ox Wagon monument (Kakebeenwa) to commemorate the Ossewa Trek of 1838. The ox wagon monument has an impression of a wagon wheel track made in concrete to commemorate the exodus of dissident Afrikaners from the Western Cape. In the past, Napier's main craftsmen were blacksmiths, a heritage which is commemorated by annual festivals. Other annual events are the Patatfees (Sweet Potato Festival), every June, and the \\"Voet van Afrika\\" (Foot of Africa) Marathon which is run in mid-September.

If this is to be believed, the name Yang Jiye is technically incorrect, but shows up not only in the History of Liao, but also in a few Song documents including Ouyang Xiu's 1051 eulogy about a Yang family member. (died August 986According to the Liao imperial government received news of Yang's capture from general Yel√º Xiezhen on 17 August 986. A more detailed message from Yel√º Xiezhen, which mentioned Yang's death 3 days after his capture, was received on 1 September. Considering the distance of almost 900km between the battlefield near Shuozhou and the Liao capital of Shangjing, as well as the frequency of the communications, Yang's death most likely occurred in early- or mid-August, and definitely no later than 19 August.), named Liu Jiye (ÂäâÁπºÊ•≠) before 979 and Yang Chonggui (Ê•äÈáçË≤¥) in his youth, was a military general in imperial China, serving first the Northern Han state during the last years of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and later the Song Dynasty which annexed Northern Han in 979. While at Northern Han, he took on the surname \\"Liu\\", having been adopted by Northern Han's founding emperor Liu Chong as a grandson. He must have been adopted as a grandson since the new given name \\"Jiye\\" shared the same generation name \\"Ji\\" as Liu Chong's other grandsons Liu Ji'en and Liu Jiyuan. After pledging allegiance to Emperor Taizong of Song, he was stationed at Song's northern border with the Khitan-ruled Liao Dynasty, where, in 980, he played an instrumental role in expelling a major Liao invasion in Yanmen Pass. Early life Yang Chonggui was born in a military family. Growing up, his father Yang Xin (Ê•ä‰ø°) was named the Linzhou (È∫üÂ∑û; modern Shenmu County, Shaanxi) prefect (Âà∫Âè≤) during the Later Han (947‚Äì951). At a young age, Yang Chonggui was a very good horse archer, always returning with several times more game than others on hunting trips. He used dogs and falcons to hunt and saw it as a way to prepare for a career commanding soldiers as a military general. Career under Northern Han In his 20s, he joined warlord Liu Chong (Liu Min), quickly becoming a chief director of defense (‰øùË°õÊåáÊèÆ‰Ωø) after Liu established the Northern Han state in Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ; modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) in 951. Yang showed enough gallantry in battles, some against the neighboring Khitan-ruled Liao Dynasty, for the new ruler to bestow the youngster the name Liu Jiye so that they share the same surname. In 968, Northern Han was attacked by the Song Dynasty, and its 4th ruler Liu Jiyuan sought help from Liao, but Liu Jiye suggested attacking Liao's unsuspecting reinforcement to capture their horses: \\"The Khitans are greedy and untrustworthy, they will definitely invade our country one day.\\" Liu Jiyuan refused the proposal, and eventually the Song forces withdrew. Liu Jiye was already the Jianxiong Command (Âª∫ÈõÑËªç) military governor when the Song forces invaded again in 979. With Emperor Taizong of Song personally leading the troops, Song forces quickly reached Jinyang. Liu Jiyuan came out to surrender, but Liu Jiye continued fighting and defending the capital city. Impressed by his bravery, Emperor Taizong ordered Liu Jiyuan to persuade him to surrender. Having received Liu Jiyuan's message, Liu Jiye cried and bowed to the north, then took off his armor to surrender. A pleased Emperor Taizong rewarded him very well, and he changed his name to Yang Ye. Career under Song Knowing Yang Ye's experience in defending the same area from the Liao Dynasty, Emperor Taizong named Yang prefect over Daizhou on the frontier and the armed force director (ÂÖµÈ¶¨ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤) of the neighboring Sanjiao (‰∏â‰∫§) military base. Previously Yang was also named a defense commissioner (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø). Yang was illiterate but knew military strategies well. He would join his soldiers in military exercises, enduring the same hardship as his inferiors. Winters were very frigid in the area, but Yang never asked anyone to start a fire for him as he handled military matters outdoors. His soldiers were very loyal to him. In 980, the Liao invasion started with roughly 100,000 Liao soldiers arriving before Yanmen, a pass on the Great Wall in Dai Prefecture and a strategic choke point. After the arrival of Song army commander Pan Mei in Daizhou, Yang and a few hundred cavalrymen took a difficult route on the west, arriving at the north and back of the enemy. As Pan and Yang attacked from both directions, the Liao army suffered a catastrophic defeat: Liao general Li Chonghui (ÊùéÈáçË™®) was captured; while Emperor Jingzong of Liao's brother-in-law and military governor Xiao Chuoli (Ëï≠ÂïúË£è) was killed.Xiao Duoli (Ëï≠ÂíÑÊùé) in the original source. Song forces acquired countless horses, saddles, and armor. Following this battle, the Liao army would \\"retreat immediately whenever they saw [Yang] Ye's flag\\", according to History of Song. Within two years of his surrender, Yang was promoted to the nominal post of surveillance commissioner (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø) of Yunzhou (Èõ≤Â∑û, modern Datong, Shanxi, then still under Liao control), while retaining his appointments in Daizhou and the Sanjiao military base. Several Song border generals became jealous. Some sent letters to Emperor Taizong listing Yang's shortcomings. Emperor Taizong allegedly forwarded the letters to Yang to show his trust. Death In 986, the Song armies embarked on a large-scale northern campaign to take the Sixteen Prefectures from Liao. One of the three forces was led by Pan Mei, assisted by Yang Ye, along with military supervisors Wang Shen (Áéã‰æÅ) and Liu Wenyu (ÂäâÊñáË£ï). In a little over a month, this force had already conquered 4 of the 16 prefectures, namely Huanzhou (ÂØ∞Â∑û, part of modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), Shuozhou, Yingzhou (ÊáâÂ∑û; modern Ying County, Shanxi) and Yunzhou, killing thousands of Liao soldiers. Yang Ye's son Yang Yanlang (Yang Yanzhao) was the vanguard general in the attacks of Shuozhou and Yingzhou. Elsewhere, Gao Hua (È´òÂåñ), a capable subordinate general whom Yang Ye valued and promoted, captured Liao general Dapengyi (Â§ßÈµ¨Áøº). However, another Song force on the east led by Cao Bin was destroyed by a Liao force led by Yel√º Xiuge, and tens of thousands of Song soldiers perished. As the Liao force with over 100,000 soldiers marched westward, Pan and Yang Ye were in Daizhou and received orders to help the civilians of the four conquered prefectures retreat back to Song territory. When Huanzhou fell to the Liao army, Yang told Pan, \\"Liao forces are strong and we must not fight them.\\" He proposed a detailed plan to maximize the safety of the civilians from the 3 remaining prefectures. Per this plan, the Yunzhou civilians would leave first. The main Song force would advance from Daizhou to Yingzhou, drawing the main Liao force, thus allowing the Shuozhou civilians to leave and move to a valley called Shijiegu (Áü≥Á¢£Ë∞∑), which could be defended by a thousand soldiers with arrows. Finally a cavalry reinforcement would help the main Song force retrieve the Yingzhou civilians. The generals defending Shuozhou and Yunzhou would be notified of the plan to coordinate activities. Wang Shen refuted his suggestion, jeering, \\"Such cowardice despite having tens of thousands of strong soldiers!\\" With the support of Liu Wenyu, he insisted that Yang immediately take his troops to take the enemy head-on. Yang reiterated his belief that such a move would bring defeat, which was met by Wang's rebuttal of \\"You sir have been called 'invincible', but today you are so hesitant in face of the enemy and reluctant to fight. Is your loyalty elsewhere?\\" Yang had no choice but to reply, \\"I am not evading death, but this is a bad situation which would make soldiers die and injure in vain. However, since you accuse me for fearing death, I will be the first (to die) before you all.\\" He pointed at the end of a valley called Chenjiagu (Èô≥ÂÆ∂Ë∞∑, in modern Shuozhou): \\"Gentlemen, please put infantrymen with arrows on both sides of that place, so that they could attack from both directions and provide assistance in case I retreat there. Otherwise, the situation could be dire.\\" Pan and Wang agreed, and led their men to the place. Liao general Yel√º Xiezhen heard of Yang's arrival and set up an ambush. Yang engaged the Liao force in a bloody battle and fought from noon to dusk until he indeed retreated to the end of Chenjiagu, but no Song soldier was there, as Pan and Wang had already left. As the enemy closed in, Yang Ye's son Yang Yanyu (Ê•äÂª∂Áéâ) was killed, as was a 72-year-old subordinate Wang Gui (ÁéãË≤¥) who continued fighting with his fists after exhausting all arrows. Seeing only around a hundred soldiers around him, Yang Ye told them, \\"You all have fathers, mothers, wives and children, no point in dying together with me. Return home and serve the emperor later.\\" His men all cried, but nobody left. Liao soldiers were instructed to capture Yang alive. Even with several dozen wounds on him, Yang fought on, killing about a hundred enemy soldiers by himself. He was captured when his horse was gravely wounded by an arrow from Liao general Yel√º Xidi. Yel√º Xiezhen yelled, \\"You have been fighting with our country for over 30 years. What do you have to say today!\\" To which Yang replied, \\"I deserve the death sentence.\\" He allegedly sighed and said, \\"The emperor has treated me so kindly, expecting me to conquer the enemy and defend the borders in return. However, due to persecutions from treacherous officials, the royal troops have been defeated. How can I live on?\\" He starved himself and died 3 days later of infections. As expected Yunzhou, Yingzhou and other prefectures were recaptured by the Liao army, but according to History of Liao, it was because Song generals \\"abandoned the cities and fled when they heard of (Yang) Jiye's death\\". Aftermath Yang Ye's severed head was presented to the young Emperor Shengzong of Liao and his mother Empress Dowager Xiao Yanyan. This was such a great victory for the Liao, where Buddhism was the state religion, that Kailong Temple (ÈñãÈæçÂØ∫) in the capital Shangjing (‰∏ä‰∫¨, in today's Baarin Left Banner) conducted religious activities for a month and provided food for over 10,000 monks. In the Song Dynasty, the Yang family was initially compensated only 100 rolls of silk, 100 rolls of textile and 10 stones of rice for Yang Ye's death. In comparison, the family of a lesser general He Huaipu (Ë≥ÄÊá∑Êµ¶) who also died in the same battle was compensated 100 rolls of silk, 100 strings of coins, 20 bottles of wine, and 15 sheep, indicating possible scapegoating against Yang. What exactly happened afterwards is unclear, but a few months later Emperor Taizong proclaimed the following edict: Yang Ye's six surviving sons were also given official appointments, especially Yang Yanzhao, who would become a prominent general himself. Invincible Yang Temple Liao Dynasty had built an \\"Invincible Yang Temple\\" in Gubeikou shortly after his death. Its earliest mention was a 1055 poem \\"Passing Gubeikou's Invincible Yang Temple\\" (ÈÅéÂè§ÂåóÂè£Ê•äÁÑ°ÊïµÂªü) by Song politician Liu Chang (ÂäâÊïû), who went to Liao on a mission that year. In a 1089 poem, \\"Gubeikou's Invincible Yang Temple\\" (Âè§ÂåóÂè£Ê•äÁÑ°ÊïµÂªü), Su Zhe who was also visiting Liao, compared Yang to the Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420) general Zhou Chu who was similarly persecuted by his superior.Su Zhe (1089), \\"Gubeikou's Invincible Yang Temple\\" (Âè§ÂåóÂè£Ê•äÁÑ°ÊïµÂªü) This temple is still at the location today in Gubeikou, Miyun County, Beijing. In fiction In the popular Generals of the Yang Family legends, Yang Ye married She Saihua, a woman skilled in martial arts and archery. In most versions, his weapon is a poled golden glaive. The older Yang Ye is usually called Yang Linggong (Ê•ä‰ª§ÂÖ¨, literally \\"Commander Lord Yang\\"). During the battle of Mount Twin Wolves, he was surrounded by enemies. His eldest three sons had already died and his fourth and fifth sons were missing. His sixth son Yang Yanzhao asked the seventh son to seek aid while he tried to fight a way out for the father. Feeling hopeless, Yang Ye saw in a distance a headstone on the ground. The name on it was Li Ling, a famous Han Dynasty general who in 99BC was forced to lead an army of 5,000 to attack the 80,000-men strong Xiongnu army from the north. Fighting valiantly for over 10 days and killing over 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, Li received no reinforcement and defected to his enemy in the end, resulting in the execution of his entire family back home. Refusing to become another Li Ling, Yang Ye decided to commit suicide by ramming his head on the stele. The Water Margin character, Yang Zhi, is stated to be one of Yang Ye's descendants, and Yang Ye is mentioned to have been one of the many generations to have wielded Yang Zhi's legendary sabre.

It is the first installment in the Clock Tower series. The story follows orphan Jennifer Simpson soon after she is adopted by the Barrows family along with other orphaned girls. Shortly after arriving at the Barrows family manor, one of the other children is killed by the game‚Äôs antagonist Scissorman. Jennifer must then explore the Barrows Mansion to find a way to escape while evading Scissorman, leading to one of the game's multiple endings. Clock Tower utilizes a point and click interface with the player controlling a cursor to direct Jennifer's actions. Much of Clock Tower's plot and artistic style are inspired by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena. The game sold \\"fairly well\\" upon release. An updated version, titled Clock Tower: The First Fear was ported to the PlayStation, WonderSwan, and Windows. Many years later, it was re-released again on the PlayStation Network, as well as the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, although fan translations exist. In retrospective reviews, Clock Tower has been praised for its haunting atmosphere and is considered a predecessor to other horror video games and the survival horror genre, but the puzzles and exploration drew criticism for being tedious. Gameplay Jennifer struggling with Bobby while in 'panic mode' Clock Tower is a survival horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor to direct the main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait in the corner of the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them in the inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each playthrough. Jennifer is under the constant threat of a stalker named Scissorman. When Scissorman is confronted, the game will enter \\"panic mode.\\" Depending on Jennifer's health status, she may begin to trip, slow down and eventually be killed. Jennifer cannot use weapons against Scissorman. Instead the player must find hiding spots throughout the mansion which are key to Jennifer's survival, or use traps placed in the environment. If caught, the player can rapidly press a button which allows them an attempt to escape. If Jennifer dies it is game over, returning the player to the title screen with an option to continue the game. The game features eight possible endings. Plot The story follows Jennifer Simpson, an orphan from the fictional Granite Orphanage in Romsdalen, Norway. She and other orphaned children named Laura, Anne, and Lotte are adopted in September 1995 by a wealthy recluse named Simon Barrows, who lives in a mansion known as the \\"Clock Tower\\", named after its predominant feature. After arriving at the mansion, Mary, the woman who brought the children to the mansion, leaves to find Mr. Barrows. When she takes an unusually long time, Jennifer offers to investigate. Upon leaving the room, she hears a scream coming from the main foyer. Jennifer returns to find the lights off and the girls missing. After finding either Laura or Anne killed, she finds herself being stalked by a murderous little boy with deformed features, wielding a huge pair of scissors, named Bobby Barrows, also known as the Scissorman in the game. While exploring the mansion, Jennifer searches for Mary's true intentions. Depending on choices made by the player, Jennifer will either discover Simon Barrows trapped in a jail cell inside the courtyard, or her father's corpse in a hidden room. If the former happens, Jennifer will need to give him a piece of ham as food. If the latter happens, Jennifer will find his death letter that tells of his account concerning Mary Barrows and her twins, Bobby and Dan. It says that he was trapped there for three days, until his death on November 10, 1986. Jennifer then visits a small, occult-looking church. If the player has collected all the necessary items and clues, then she gains access to the catacombs of the mansion - using either the Devil Idol or the Sceptor, but the former is canonical as it appears in the sequel. Jennifer sees a cloaked figure walking ahead of her; this is Mary. She follows it, wearing a disguise to fool the guard dog using Mary's perfume, and a black cloak found in the mansion. If Lotte did not need to rescue Jennifer from the jail cell, she can be found dying at an altar, and tells Jennifer about the switches in the clock tower. Otherwise, she rescues Jennifer from the jail cell, but is shot by a threatening Mary. Jennifer enters a room where she discovers Dan Barrows, a giant, gluttonous purple creature. Dan awakens from his slumber and chases Jennifer to a steep cliff. She successfully climbs over, knocking down a can of kerosene which splashes onto a nearby candle. This triggers an explosion that immolates Dan, while Jennifer rides an elevator out of the catacombs. She ends up defeating Bobby in the clock tower, and Mary as well in (or around, depending on prior actions) the clock tower. If Ann (or Laura) has not died yet, then this survivor reunites with Jennifer at the clock tower but later be thrown down the tower by Mary. These actions would lead to one of Endings A, B, or C - any of these could be canonical according to the events of the next game. Because of the game's open-ended nature, the player can also discover other endings. Development The design of protagonist Jennifer Simpson was inspired by that of Jennifer Corvino from Phenomena (played by Jennifer Connelly). Clock Tower was directed by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game to pay homage to one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas and is inspired by his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one. Kono described Clock Tower as an experimental project with a small budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique at the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway. Release Clock Tower was first released on the Super Famicom on September 14, 1995. According to Kono, the game sold \\"fairly well.\\" It was later re- released under the title Clock Tower: The First Fear on PlayStation on July 17, 1997. Upon release, the PlayStation version made it the 8th on the sales charts, selling 54,293 copies. This release featured a new dagger weapon, a new room, and minor scenario additions. It was also released for Windows, and both the PlayStation and Windows versions also featured full motion video scenes, and minor graphical improvements. It was later released for the WonderSwan, which was rendered in monochrome and plays slower. Clock Tower was digitally re-released for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console in Japan in 2010 and 2013 respectively. It has also reached multiple PlayStation devices via a release on the PlayStation Network in 2011, also exclusively in Japan. Clock Tower has not been officially released outside Japan; however, fan translations exist. In 2015, the soundtrack was released, titled CLOCK TOWER 20th Anniversary Sound Collection. This includes audio from the original, PlayStation, and Windows versions of the game, as well as music from the games Clock Tower 2, and Clock Tower: Ghost Head. Reception Famitsu gave the Super Famicom version a score of 31 out of 40, and the PlayStation version a 27 out of 40 score, and the Wonderswan version a 22 out of 40. In a retrospective review, Hernando Vallejo of Hardcore Gaming 101 described Clock Tower as \\"one of the most thrilling experiences the [horror] genre can offer.\\" He praised the game's graphics and sound for building a strong atmosphere. Allistair Pinsof of Destructoid praised the graphics, story, and the Dario Argento-inspired style for creating a haunting mood and atmosphere. He also praised the multiple endings and unique gameplay design. However, he found Clock Tower failed to create an interesting adventure experience due to the difficulty of navigating the mansion layout, excessive item hunting, and simple puzzles. He criticized the game's attempt to place a 3D space within a 2D game, which created confusion when exploring. Despite these flaws, he still found Clock Tower worth playing, calling it \\"atmospheric horror at its most raw, for better or worse.\\" Both The A.V. Club and Pinsof believed that although Clock Tower aged poorly, it was still worth experiencing. Clock Tower has been called a \\"paragon for future horror games\\" and is considered instrumental in establishing the survival horror genre. It also solidified Human Entertainment as a developer along with Twilight Syndrome and Laplace no Ma. The 2016 mook Perfect Guide to Nostalgic Super Famicom ranked the game the second best horror game for the Super Famicom, and in 2018, The A.V. Club placed the game as number thirty on its list of top thirty-five horror games of all time.

A two-level defense does away with the contain unit in favor of increased pressure on the offense. Two-level defenses will often use one deep safety (as deep as 28 yards at the snap) to enforce an end line on the offense, but the Bear 4-6 is a two level defense with contain handled solely by the single coverage skills of the cornerbacks. The \\"Bear\\" can also function as a three- level defense, and indeed concealment of the defensive structure is a key to making this defense work. The two-level was invented to combat the run and shoot offense in the 1980s, but has stayed in use due to its adaptability in combating all types of offenses. The defense of spread formations remains a strong suit of this model.

It was the first of two feature films the duo made at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Set during World War II, just after Pearl Harbor, Stan (Stan Laurel) and Ollie (Oliver Hardy) try their hand at various business ventures. Their store opens and closes in various guises but without success. They finally open it as a bicycle store, but it goes bankrupt and they close it down to enlist in the army. They fail in every attempt to succeed in the military and return to their home town Huxton only to find out that their store now is open, with a man named Eustace Middling (Donald Meek) in charge, selling radios instead of bicycles. But Middling offers them to share the space in a joint venture. Stan and Ollie don't realize that Middling in fact is a German spy, using the shop as a front to cover a base for espionage on the US Military. The pair decide to support the civil defense by becoming air raid wardens in Huxton. To complete their training, they have to take part in an advanced military drill, and Stan of course manages to get the wrong assignment‚Äîone that is far more complicated than they can handle. They set out on their mission, to rescue a very prominent banker, J.P. Norton (Howard Freeman), from a fire, but fail hugely, ending up burying the banker alive in a huge load of sand. Still, they are given one more chance to prove their aptitude as air raid wardens, involving the task of ensuring that all the town citizens turn off their lights at night. They get into a quarrel with one of the more troublesome inhabitants, Joe Bledsoe (Edgar Kennedy), resulting in a commotion and a rumor that spy activity is taking place in Joe's home. The boys are knocked out, and in the end they are finally dismissed from the corps altogether. Back at their shop, they happen to overhear the spies speaking German, and follow them to a hide-out outside of town, where they find out Middling's real name is Mittelhause, and overhear him talking about blowing the town's magnesium plant to pieces with another spy, Rittenhause (Henry O'Neill). They try to send a message to the civil defense, but instead they are captured by the German spies. The boys manage to flee and alert the civil defense, who arrive at the plant just in time to stop the sabotage. Stan and Ollie also expose Middling as a German spy.

This is due to the status that drug dealers and drug cartel chiefs enjoy in some Spanish-speaking countries, where an entire culture has been developed around the business. Narcotraficantes often enjoy a high status in several Latin American countries, where they are sometimes seen as powerful and influential people who have exotic lifestyles and lead exciting lives, defying authorities while smuggling drugs to the United States. Narcotraficantes are seen as pseudo-heroes and as criminals at the same time, glorified by some people and persecuted by the government. As a result of this prestige, narcotr√°fico has developed a rich and complex culture, with songs and quasi-religious imagery and rituals. In the past months, Roberto Carrillo composed the song of \\"Pancho Narco\\", a famous song in the Republic of Mexico. This is not something peculiar to Latin America, it is common in many impoverished areas of the world, including poor US cities. It resembles, as well, the status given to moonshiners during Prohibition. The movie Traffic explores both sides of this. The drug dealers, on the US as well as the Mexican side of the border, are both vilified and admired. In Mexico, narcocorridos are popular songs along the border with the US and celebrate the illegal activities of smugglers and dealers. In Colombia, two movies detail the world of narcotr√°fico: Maria Full of Grace and La virgen de los sicarios (international title: Our Lady of the Assassins). The 2001 movie Proof of Life is based on the real-life kidnapping of Thomas Hargrove by FARC narcofraficantes.

Club career Born in Kinshasa, Zaire, Carlos started his career as a striker, subsequently moving into goalkeeper upon replacing an injured teammate. He started playing professionally with lowly U.D. Vilafranquense, having a short stint with S.C. Campomaiorense in the second division afterwards. Carlos then returned to the lower leagues, with Amora FC. After a string of good performances with F.C. Felgueiras in the second level (sharing teams with Marcelo Moretto, later of S.L. Benfica), he signed with Primeira Liga's Boavista F.C. for the 2004‚Äì05 season. At Boavista, Carlos was initially second-choice behind veteran William Andem, but eventually won starting honours. This prompted a January 2006 move to Romania's FC Steaua Bucure»ôti, thus becoming the first Portuguese player to have played in the country's Liga I. Shortly after his arrival, he lost the confidence of fans and general manager Mihai Stoica alike, with the latter declaring at a TV show that the player, although greatly underachieving, had been put under immense pressure due to the fact of being the team's only foreigner; he was released and rejoined Boavista on 30 May 2007, having previously trained for a time with Charlton Athletic to remain fit. In 2007‚Äì08, after losing first-choice status to Liechtensteiner Peter Jehle, Carlos was loaned to Foolad F.C. in January 2008, with the move being made permanent the following campaign ‚Äì the Iran Pro League club was coached by compatriot Augusto In√°cio. After spending one year in Iran, Carlos moved back to Portugal in the summer of 2009, joining Rio Ave FC. He only missed two league games, as the Vila do Conde side retained their top division status. International career Through his grandmother, Carlos chose to represent Angola at international level, the first cap coming in 2009 at nearly 30 years of age. He represented his adopted nation at the following year's Africa Cup of Nations, played on home soil. Carlos was also the starter in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, participating in the first two games but missing the third due to yellow card accumulation, as the Palancas Negras exited in the group stage.

Gottheil eventually became one of the most influential, well-known and controversial Reform Jewish leaders of his time. He was the father of Richard Gottheil. Early life He was educated in Posen under Rabbi Solomon Plessner, and later continued his studies at the universities of Berlin and Halle (Ph.D.), receiving in the meanwhile his \\"hattarat hora'ah\\" in the former city from Samuel Holdheim, whose assistant he became (1855). He also studied under Zunz and Moritz Steinschneider. In 1860 he set out from the Berliner Reformgemeinde to labor for Reform Judaism in new fields. Adult life In 1860 he received a call from the Reform Jews of Manchester, England; he went there as rabbi for the Manchester Congregation of British Jews and remained for 13 years. During this time he was connected with the faculty of Owens College as a teacher of the German language. Two of his most noteworthy sermons preached in Manchester were on the slavery question, attacking those who had declared the institution to be sanctioned by Mosaic law. Dr. Gottheil was a member of the Synod of Leipsic in 1871, which took a decided stand on the question of Reform. He left Manchester in 1873, having been elected to succeed the Rev. J. K. Gutheim as assistant to Dr. Samuel Adler, the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, New York City. When Adler retired about eighteen months later, Gottheil succeeded him. On taking charge he reorganized the religious school, and assisted in founding a theological school where preliminary training might be imparted to future candidates for the rabbinate. He prepared in 1886 the first Jewish hymn-book printed in America (with music in a separate volume by A. Davis); it contains not only traditional Jewish hymns, but also others of Christian origin, and upon it was based the Union Hymnal, which has since been generally adopted by the Reform congregations in the United States. In 1889 he started the first Sisterhood of Personal Service, a philanthropic organization affiliated with Temple Emanu-El which served as a model for similar institutions elsewhere. Dr. Gottheil was the founder of the Association of Eastern Rabbis, and when it was assimilated with the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1890, he took an active part in its deliberations. He was one of the founders and the president of the (American) Jewish Publication Society, vice-president of the Federation of American Zionists, chairman of the Revision Committee for the Union Prayer Book, and one of the governors of the Hebrew Union College, in Cincinnati. Dr. Gottheil's sympathies and interests were broadly universalist, as evidenced by his connection with various non-Jewish institutions as well as by many of his sermons and writings. He was one of the founders of the New York State Conference of Religions, assisting in the editing of its \\"Book of Common Prayers\\"; and a founder and for many years vice-president of the Nineteenth Century Club. In 1893 Gottheil was one of the representatives of the Jews at the Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago during the World Columbian Exposition. Zionist Affiliation Unlike most Reform Jews of the time, Rabbi Gottheil was a supporter of Zionism and attended the First Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland. He was the most prominent American Jew to respond to Theodor Herzl's call and served as vice-president of the newly created Federation of American Zionists, a forerunner of the Zionist Organization of America. Rabbi Gottheil's belief was an act of faith, but it brought condemnation and vilification upon him from both the American Reform community and the American Orthodox community. American Reform Judaism viewed the struggling birth of Zionism as a betrayal of loyalty to America; Zionism, they said, was unstable, and it tasted bitterly of the dangerous, ancient Anti-Semitic accusations of dual loyalty. It threatened the position of the Jews in the new Zion of America. American Orthodox Judaism equally reviled the infant Zionist movement. Zionism, they felt, was a betrayal of faith in God's ultimate promise of redemption. To the Orthodox, it denied the coming of the Messiah. Richard Gottheil, the Reluctant Father of American Zionism Literary works He published \\"Sarah\\"; and \\"Sun and Shield\\" (New York, 1896), a survey of Judaism as he saw it. Essays by Dr. Gottheil have appeared in various periodicals and collections. He was retired as rabbi emeritus of Temple Emanu- El in October, 1899. In honor of his 75th birthday a \\"Gustav Gottheil Lectureship in Semitic Languages\\" was founded at Columbia University.

Golsorkhi was a Marxist activist in Iran during the Cold War. Hooman Majd has described him as a \\"Che Guevara-like figure for young Iranians in 1974.\\"Majd, Hooman. The Ayatollah Begs to Differ. Doubleday. 2008. 241. Famous for his leftist and revolutionary poetry, Golsorkhi was convicted along with his friend, Keramat Daneshian, a director, of plotting to kidnap Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran. The military court was televised live, mainly because at the time of the trial, Mohammad Reza Shah was hosting the Conference for Human Rights in Tehran. At the time, the shah's regime was blamed for the deaths (by a car accident) of the poet Forough Farrokhzad, a woman who promised the appearance of someone who would \\"distribute bread and cough mixture equally\\", the tragic and suspect death of the folk hero and Olympic gold medalist wrestler Gholamreza Takhti in a hotel, the drowning of the writer Samad Behrangi in the river Aras, Ali Shariati's death abroad, and the tortures, killings and executions of those who had taken to an armed uprising against the regime. At his trial in 1974, just as it looked as if the [military] judges were getting the upper hand he turned the atmosphere of the court: \\"In the glorious name of the people. I will defend myself in a court which I neither recognise its legality nor its legitimacy. As a Marxist my address is to the people and history. The more you attack me the more I pride myself, the further I am from you the closer I am to the people. The more your hatred for my beliefs, the stronger the kindness and support of the people. Even if you bury me‚Äîand you certainly will‚Äîpeople will make flags and songs from my corpse\\". When colonel Ghaffarzadeh, the chief judge, admonished him to stick to his defence he replied with a wry smile: \\"are you frightened of my words?\\". The judge shouted back \\"I order you shut up and sit down\\". Eyes flashing in anger Golesorkhi spoke passionately \\"Don't you give me any orders. Go and order your corporals and squadron leaders. I doubt if my voice is loud enough to awaken a sleeping conscience here. Don't be afraid. Even in this so-called respectable court, bayonets protect you\\". Earlier Golesorkhi had defended himself: \\"Iranian society should know that I am here being tried and condemned to death purely for holding Marxist views. My crime is not conspiracy, nor an assassination but my views. In this court, in the presence of foreign journalists, I accuse the court, the fabricators of the dossier against me and against the irresponsible judges. I draw the attention of all human rights authorities, committees, and organisations to witness this stage managed farce, this state crime that is about to take place. The military court did not even give itself the trouble of reading my file. I am a Marxist-Leninist, I respect Islamic sharia' and will shout my views, for which I die, in a loud voice: nowhere in the world, in countries like ours which are dependent to and dominated by neo- colonialism, can a truly national government exist unless a Marxist infrastructure is created in society\\". Golsorkhi was given the opportunity to read a speech in his own defense. He began with some eloquence comparing the struggle of the Iranian left with that of Imam Hussein, the revered martyr of Shia Islam. He then continued to discuss the evils of land reform, as practiced by the Shah's regime, and the struggles of the Iranian peasants who first labored under the feudal system in Iran and then under the corrupt land reform. At this point, the chief judge of the military tribunal told him that he should limit his speech to his own defense. Golsorkhi responded by saying that his defense is the defense of the masses against tyranny. The chief judge said, once again, that he should only defend himself. Golsorkhi picked up his papers and said: \\"I will then sit down. I will not speak and I will sit down.\\" He sat down and did not speak in his own defense any further. Once asked if he will continue his terrorist business he answered \\"Yes\\". When the judge announced death sentences on both Daneshian and Golesorkhi they merely smiled. They then shook hands and embraced. \\"Comrade!\\" said Golesorkhi. \\"My best comrade!\\" replied Daneshian. Golsorkhi's execution was broadcast on state television. The court became a symbol of the Shah's dictatorship and hypocrisy, due to its content most of the trial proceedings was censored. After the 1979 revolution the entire trial was shown on public television, but again it was censored after the fall of Mehdi Bazargan's government. He was executed, and was acclaimed a hero by socialist Guerrillas because he wished not to be blind-folded. The cell in which they spent their last night [February 17, 1974] in Jamshidiyeh prison was covered with slogans. They sang revolutionary songs all night, ate their supper quietly, shouted slogans to the soldiers in the lorry which took them to the Chitgar execution field, refused blindfolds so that they could see the red dawn and sang together in firm voice: \\"O comrades! Heroes! We will give our life for our country without fear ... They then themselves gave the order to fire! Golesorkhi had written: \\"A person has an artistic eye whose art has a wider link with the people. ... an artist has a style that forges a link to the life of the people of his land and keeps the torch of struggle alight in them. This style may not fit any literary school, just as the poetry of the Palestinian Fadayeens does not. Why should it fit any literary school. Why imprison our poetry, which is our only effective art form, in literary and stylistic schools? The place of a poem is not in libraries, but in tongues and minds. Literature must retain the role it always had in social movements for us too in the displacement of social order, and fulfill it. The role of literature is to awaken. The role of progressive literature is to create social movements and to help attain the goals of historic development of peoples\\".

Early life Edward was born in New Holstein, Wisconsin, the eighth child of German immigrants Joachim and Dorothea (Kuehl) Schildhauer. Edward's father Joachim left Germany in 1852 and visited his family in Brazil. Some people in Brazil told Joachim that Wisconsin was a great place to move to, and Joachim ended up settling in New Holstein. After being schooled at New Holstein High School, he worked as a helper swinging a 14-pound sledgehammer in 1888. In 1892 he went to Milwaukee to play in an orchestra and worked with covering steam boilers with sheet metal. The job was so hot that worker had to rest every 20 minutes. While resting, he observed a white-collar worker while he operated an electric switchboard and he decided that he wanted to work a less physical job. So in January 1894 he attended college at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He graduated from college in 1897 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. Edward later obtained a degree in mechanical engineering. He moved to Baltimore doing construction observation. In 1902 Edward married Ruth Burton Crall. Edward worked at the Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago from 1898 to 1906. He worked his way up from a draftsman, then to an assistant electrical engineer, and then to an assistant mechanical engineer. Along the way Edward was credited with several patents including a technique to develop blueprints with arc lights. Panama Canal Construction In 1906 he was appointed to the Panama Canal enterprise as a mechanical and electrical engineer and spent nearly a year in Washington D.C. designing plans for the canal. He had to design the canal system from scratch because no other systems of this type had been built at that time. Edward and his wife arrived on the Isthmus of Panama in September 1907 and he was employed on the project until 1914. He is credited with the complete design of the opening and closing machinery system for the gates on the canal. Schildhauer's system contains 20 foot diameter wheels that are connected by steel arms to 27 hp electric motors that moved the gates on the reduction of gears. He also patented the design for the lock machinery and electrical locomotive system for towing vessels through the locks. Today his equipment can still be seen working beneath the locks, although the lock system is soon to be replaced. Later life During World War I Edward was a munitions firm executive. Edward then took part in the design of aircraft from 1919-1924. From 1924 until his retirement in 1931, Edward was the vice president of the Allied Chemical and Dye Corp. In 1946 Schildhauer became president of the Los Angeles County Republican Assembly and in 1948 he became the treasurer of the California Republican Assembly. He served as a delegate to the 16th district of California for the 1948 national Republican convention. Edward lived in Los Angeles for 17 years. Edward Schildhauer died at the age of 80 in Los Angeles, California on May 24, 1953. Edward is buried at the New Holstein City Cemetery in New Holstein, Wisconsin.

(known as SimCoaster in the United States and Australia and Theme Park Manager in Germany) is a construction and management simulation video game. It is the sequel to Theme Park World (1999). Theme Park Inc. was developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts. It was the last game to bear the Bullfrog logo before the company's merger with EA UK in 2004. Gameplay Screenshot The player starts out as the assistant manager of a theme park, hired by the president of the company to take over his position. To do this, the player must build and manage a theme park with three unique zones: Land of Invention, Polar Zone, and Arabian Nights. Each zone has unique rides, sideshows and scenery items. The player is guided by the president and his directors (each of whom specialize in a specific area of park management), and is aided by a blue spherical creature, named the Advisor, who gives the player advice. The player must hire staff to maintain the park, keep guests happy, and research new items for the player to build. Staff members must be kept well-rested and happy, or they may go on strike. To advance further into the game, the player must complete several objectives. These objectives involve training staff for a specific job to unlock a new section of the park zone, or completing challenges to gain golden tickets, which are required to beat those objectives. Challenges include keeping guest happiness levels high, making sure a ride does not break down, or making a certain amount of profit from a specific ride. Completing these challenges will give a specified number of golden tickets, and certain challenges must be completed to complete an objective. However, if the player fails too many challenges, they will be fired and the game will be over. The objective of the game is to become the new boss of Theme park Inc by accruing a majority stake in the company and several park awards (e.g., the highest or fastest roller coaster, the fastest go kart, the longest log flume ride, the best security, the best decoration and the best staff training). Theme Park Inc, in comparison to Theme Park World, has a greater emphasis on the management of the park rather than the rides themselves. The game requires more effort be put into finer aspects such as staff management, park layout, and guests' needs, as not doing so can make it more difficult to complete challenges and objectives. Theme Park Inc also introduced the Roller Coaster Editor, an in- built feature that allows players to create their own layouts for the pylon rides (roller coasters and log flumes) in the game. The players can then save these designs and use them in the game proper. Reception In the United States, Theme Park Inc sold 290,000 copies and earned $5.8 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2001. It was the country's 68th best- selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. It received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Theme Park Inc received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave the game 8.5/10, stating that the game has a visual charm that similar games, such as RollerCoaster Tycoon, lack. IGN also states that the game is much improved from Theme Park World, in regards to the interface and advisor system.

A member of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia and chairman of its Vigilance Committee, Still took Johnson and her sons from her master and into hiding just before their ship was to depart. They were en route from Washington, DC to New York City (from where they would sail to Nicaragua with her master.) He was acquitted in the jury trial.  Production history The work was presented in New York City in an Equity staged reading, in February 2003, at the Theatre at St. Clements, directed by Larry Thelen of Goodspeed Musicals. It was produced at Theatre Building Chicago's \\"Stages\\" festival in 2003, as well as the NYC ASCAP Musical Theater Workshop in 2004. It has also been produced in colleges, libraries, and historical societies. The musical has attracted wide interest, and has been reported and reviewed in more than 20 publications and media outlets, including National Public Radio, and the op-ed section of The Philadelphia Inquirer. In the summer of 2011, an abridged version of the work was produced at the Duplex Cabaret Theatre in NYC, featuring Quentin Darrington and Kenita Miller.  Synopsis ;Act I The action begins in Virginia, where Jane Johnson, the slave of planter and politician John Hill Wheeler, learns that her eldest child has been sold. When she learns that Wheeler will be taking her and her two sons through Philadelphia on his way to New York City and a diplomatic assignment in Nicaragua, she swears to escape to freedom in the North with her two sons. The focus shifts further south, where another slave, Peter Freedman, has secretly earned his freedom after many years in bondage. Strangers to each other, Peter and Jane end up on the same train, traveling north to Philadelphia. Peter is going to seek his long-lost mother, from whom he was separated as a child. Jane hopes to escape with her children once her master brings her onto free soil. In Philadelphia, Peter begins to search the city, and Jane tries to pass a message to a black porter at her hotel. Finally, word of her desire for freedom reaches William Still at the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Office. At the same time, Peter walks in. When he tells his story, Still realizes that this is his own brother, left behind in slavery when his mother escaped years before, and identifies himself. But Peter is so alarmed at this unlikely coincidence that, suspecting some duplicity, he flees Still's office and quickly disappears into the streets. Still leads abolitionists to the Camden ferry; in a dramatic confrontation on the ship, he helps Jane and her children walk away from Wheeler. Still grabs a coach and takes them into hiding. When he returns to the Society office, Still finds Peter waiting for him, and they are reunited. Still is arrested and sued for forcible abduction and riot by Wheeler for his part in the rescue of Jane Johnson. ;Act II As the second act starts, Jane Johnson and her children flee north. The trial of William Still has become a national event, pitting the values and the laws of Pennsylvania against the South, which had gained passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Wheeler sues Still and five other African Americans in federal court under that law, to retaliate for his public humiliation. Seth Concklin, an abolitionist inspired by William Still's action, embarks upon a quest to liberate Peter‚Äôs wife, Vina, who is still enslaved in the Deep South. Though Concklin succeeds in bringing Vina north to free soil, bounty hunters pursue them and kill him in trying to recapture Vina. She is seen to elude capture, though her fate is unclear. In the final scene, Still is brought to trial. The prosecution appears to have a strong case and the judge is known to be ally of Wheeler; but the defense introduces a surprise witness: Jane Johnson. She has come out of hiding to testify on Still's behalf. The judge orders the US marshals to arrest Jane, but she escapes, with the help of Philadelphia and state officials. Because of her testimony, Still is acquitted, as are others of the defendants. The epilogue finds Still at his desk in the Anti-Slavery office. Vina enters, seeking news of her husband, and Still helps them reunite.

It has been proposed for standardization to the IETF in July 2006 (see RFC 4568.)  How it works  The keys are transported in the SDP attachment of a SIP message. That means, the SIP transport layer must make sure that no one else can see the attachment. This can be done by using TLS transport layer, or other methods like S/MIME. Using TLS assumes that the next hop in the SIP proxy chain can be trusted and it will take care about the security requirements of the request. The main advantage of this method is that it is extremely simple. The key exchange method has been picked up by several vendors already, even though some vendors do not use a secure mechanism to transport the key. This helps to get the critical mass of implementation to make this method the de facto standard. To illustrate this principle with an example, the phone sends a call to the proxy. By using the sips scheme, it indicates that the call must be made secure. The key is base-64 encoded in the SDP attachment.

In order to avoid initial clicks, those packets must be dropped. Usually this is only a short period of time (below 100 ms), so that this is no major problem. The SDES method does not address the \\"end-to-end\\" media encryption. For example, if user A is talking to user B via a proxy P, SDES allows negotiation of keys between A and P or between B and P, but not between A and B. For end-to-end media security you must first establish a trust relationship with the other side. If you use a trusted intermediate for this, the call setup delay will significantly increase, which makes applications like push-to-talk difficult. If you do this peer-to-peer, it might be difficult for you to identify the other side. For example, your operator might implement a B2BUA architecture and play the role of the other side, so that you still don't have end-to-end security. Newer, modern protocols, like ZRTP, offer end-to-end encryption for SIP/RTP calls.

It is unclear to which other species it is most closely related, but it is classified as a member of the tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. The Rodrigues parrot bore similarities to the broad-billed parrot of Mauritius, and may have been related. Two additional species have been assigned to its genus (N. francicus and N. borbonicus), based on descriptions of parrots from the other Mascarene islands, but their identities and validity have been debated. The Rodrigues parrot was green, and had a proportionally large head and beak and a long tail. Its exact size is unknown, but it may have been around long. It was the largest parrot on Rodrigues, and it had the largest head of any Mascarene parrot. It may have looked similar to the great-billed parrot. By the time it was discovered, it frequented and nested on islets off southern Rodrigues, where introduced rats were absent, and fed on the seeds of the shrub Fernelia buxifolia. The species is known from subfossil bones and from mentions in contemporary accounts. It was last mentioned in 1761, and probably became extinct soon after, perhaps due to a combination of predation by rats, deforestation, and hunting by humans. Taxonomy Holotype beak, 1873 Birds thought to be the Rodrigues parrot were first mentioned by Fran√ßois Leguat in his 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there. Subsequent accounts were written by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his Relation de l'√éle Rodrigue, and then by the French mathematician Alexandre Pingr√©, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus. The Rodrigues parrot was scientifically described and named as Psittacus rodricanus in 1867 by the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards, based on a subfossil partial beak. The specific name refers to Rodrigues, which is itself named after the discoverer of the island, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Rodrigues. Milne- Edwards corrected the spelling of the specific name to rodericanus in 1873 (in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds), a spelling which was used in the literature henceforward, but it was changed back to rodricanus by the IOC World Bird List in 2014. Milne-Edwards moved the species to its own genus Necropsittacus in 1874; the name is derived from the Greek words nekros, which means dead, and psittakos, parrot, in reference to the bird being extinct. The current whereabouts of the holotype beak are unknown. It may be specimen UMZC 575, a rostrum that was sent from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist Alfred Newton after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne- Edwards's paper, but this cannot be confirmed. In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, but subfossils have been discovered in caves on the Plaine Corail and in Caverne Tortue. In the footnotes to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil species with parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Julien Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified a description of the Rodrigues parrot. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter. =Evolution= Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), are derived from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987. Hume has suggested that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. =Hypothetical extinct relatives= 1907 illustration by Henrik Gr√∂nvold, showing the colouration of the hypothetical species N. borbonicus combined with the body- plan of the Rodrigues parrot The British zoologist Walther Rothschild assigned two hypothetical parrot species from the other Mascarene Islands to the genus Necropsittacus; N. francicus in 1905 and N. borbonicus in 1907. Rothschild gave the original description of N. francicus as \\"head and tail fiery red, rest of body and tail green\\", and stated it was based on descriptions from voyages to Mauritius in the 17th and early 18th century. N. borbonicus (named for Bourbon, the original name of R√©union) was based on a single account by the French traveller Sieur Dubois, who mentioned \\"green parrots of the same size [presumably as the R√©union parakeet (Psittacula eques eques)] with head, upper parts of the wings, and tail the colour of fire\\" on R√©union. Rothschild considered it to belong to Necropsittacus since Dubois compared it with Psittacula species, which are related. The two assigned Necropsittacus species have since become the source of much taxonomic confusion, and their identities have been debated. N. borbonicus later received common names such as R√©union red and green parakeet or R√©union parrot, and N. francicus has been called the Mauritian parrot. The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka recognised N. borbonicus in 1953, and published a restoration of it with the colouration described by Dubois and the body-plan of the Rodrigues parrot. He did not find the naming of N. francicus to have been necessary, but expressed hope more evidence would be found. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that N. borbonicus may have been an escaped pet lory seen by Dubois, since 16th century Dutch paintings show the somewhat similar East Indian chattering lory (Lorius garrulus), presumably in captivity. However, Greenway was unable to find any references that matched those Rothschild had given for N. francicus. In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke found the described colour-pattern of N. borbonicus remiscent of Psittacula parrots, but considered N. francicus to be based on confused reports. In 2001 the British writer Errol Fuller suggested Dubois's account of N. borbonicus could either have referred to an otherwise unrecorded species or have been misleading, and found N. francicus to be \\"one of the most dubious of all hypothetical species\\". In 2007, Hume suggested that Rothschild had associated N. borbonicus with the Rodrigues parrot because he had mistakenly incorporated Dubois's account into his description of the latter; he stated the Rodrigues parrot also had red plumage (though it was all-green), and had been mentioned by Dubois (who never visited Rodrigues). Rothschild also attributed the sighting of N. francicus to Dubois, repeating the colour-pattern he had described earlier for the Rodrigues parrot, and this led Hume to conclude that the name N. francicus was based solely on \\"the muddled imagination of Lord Rothschild\\". Hume added that if Dubois's description of N. borbonicus was based on a parrot endemic to R√©union, it may have been derived from the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria), which has a similar colouration, apart from the red tail. Description Life restoration of two Rodrigues parrots The Rodrigues parrot was described as being the largest parrot species on the island, with a big head and a long tail. Its plumage was described as being of uniform green colouration. Its skull was flat and depressed compared to those of most other parrots, but similar to the genus Ara. The skull was long without the beak, wide, and deep. The coracoid (part of the shoulder) was long, the humerus (upper-arm bone) , the ulna (lower-arm bone) , the femur (thigh-bone) , the tibia (lower-leg bone) , and the metatarsus (foot bone) . Its exact body length is unknown, but it may have been around , comparable to the size of a large cockatoo. Its tibia was 32% smaller than that of a female broad-billed parrot, yet the pectoral bones were of similar size, and proportionally its head was the largest of any Mascarene species of parrot. The Rodrigues parrot was similar in skeletal structure to the parrot genera Tanygnathus and Psittacula. The pectoral and pelvic bones were similar in size to those of the New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), and it may have looked like the great- billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) in life, but with a larger head and tail. It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several skeletal features, including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards. No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism. There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups. Behaviour and ecology The Rodrigues parrot may have resembled the great-billed parrot Tafforet's 1726 description is the only detailed account of the Rodrigues parrot in life: Tafforet also mentioned that the parrots ate the seeds of the shrub Fernelia buxifolia (\\"bois de buis\\"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Due to a large population of introduced rats on Rodrigues, the parrots, the Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus), and the Rodrigues pigeon (Nesoenas rodericanus), frequented and nested on offshore islets, where the rats were absent. Many of the other endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to deforestation. The Rodrigues parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), the Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl (Mascarenotus murivorus), the Rodrigues night heron (Nycticorax megacephalus), and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis peltastes), the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis vosmaeri), and the Rodrigues day gecko (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni). Extinction alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with solitaires Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula eques echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Like mainland Rodrigues, the offshore islets were eventually infested by rats, which is believed to have caused the demise of the Rodrigues parrot and other birds there. The rats probably preyed on their eggs and chicks. Pingr√© indicated that local species were popular game, and found that the Rodrigues parrot was rare: Pingr√© also reported that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation.

In a three-year career, Figga hit .213 with one home run.  Early life and education  Born in Tampa, Florida, Figga attended A.P. Leto High School in Tampa, graduating in 1988. Figga then enjoyed a short but standout career at Central Florida Community College. Figga was drafted in 1989 by the New York Yankees. He played in the Australian Baseball League with the Canberra Bushrangers in the 1994 and 1995 seasons.Flintoff and Dunn Alamanac  Major league career  After a long career in the minor leagues, Figga made his major-league debut on September 16, 1997, with the Yankees. Figga appeared in five games for the Yankees between 1997 and 1999. His lone major-league appearance in 1998 was on September 23, 1998, when he went one-for-four and scored a run against the Cleveland Indians.September 23, 1998 Cleveland Indians at New York Yankees Play by Play and Box Score - Baseball- Reference.com For that appearance, Figga earned a World Series ring when the Yankees won the World Series the following month. In 1999, Figga started the season as one of three catchers on the Yankees' roster, however his mere presence caused controversy amongst the Yankee brass. Out of options, (the number of times a team is allowed to demote a player to the minor leagues without exposing him to waivers) owner George Steinbrenner ordered acting manager Don Zimmer to promote Figga to the major league roster despite offering limited opportunities to play. In fact, he saw no action at all until a doubleheader on May 22 where he was a late inning defensive replacement for both games. He never batted nor appeared in another game for the Yankees. When manager Joe Torre (who missed the first two months after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in spring training) returned, he was able to convince Steinbrenner that he needed the roster spot more than he needed the player so Figga was waived in June 1999 and picked up by the Baltimore Orioles, and played 41 games for the Orioles.  After baseball  From 2000 until 2004, Figga played both in the minor leagues and for the Nashua Pride in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He subsequently retired from baseball with an early case of the dreaded disease of catchers: bad knees. Today, Figga now works for Republic National Distribution Company and lives in the Tampa Bay area of Florida and recently finished coaching a little league football team called the Westchase Colts and a travel baseball team called the Tampa Bay Bulls.

Treaty No. 9 is an agreement first signed in 1905-1906 between Anishinaabe (Algonquin and Ojibway) and Omushkegowuk Cree communities and the Crown, which includes both the government of Canada and the province of Ontario. It is commonly known as the \\"James Bay Treaty,\\" since the eastern edge of the treaty territory is the shore of James Bay in northern Ontario, Canada. By the early 1900s, both federal and provincial governments were interested in taking control of lands around the Hudson and James Bay watersheds in northern Ontario - traditionally home to Cree, Oji-Cree, and Ojibway peoples. After nearly a year of delay from Ontario, in May 1905 both governments began negotiating in the terms of the treaty's written document. Although ratification of the treaty required the agreement of Indigenous peoples living in the territory, none of the Omushkegowuk and the Anishinaabe communities expected to sign were involved in creating the terms of the written document, nor were the terms permitted to change during the treaty expedition. One First Nations community in the bordering Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec is included in this treaty. Further adhesions involving Ojibway and Swampy Cree communities were signed in 1929 and 1937. Timeline * 29 June 1905: Duncan C.

The Macedonians had just concluded the First Macedonian War and Philip, seeing his chance to defeat Rhodes, formed an alliance with Aetolian and Spartan pirates who began raiding Rhodian ships. Philip also formed an alliance with several important Cretan cities, such as Hierapytna and Olous. With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates, Philip believed his chance to crush Rhodes was at hand. To help achieve his goal, he formed an alliance with the King of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus the Great, against Ptolemy V of Egypt (the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two Diadochi states). Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes's allies in Thrace and around the Propontis. In 202 BC, Rhodes and her allies Pergamum, Cyzicus, and Byzantium combined their fleets and defeated Philip at the Battle of Chios. Just a few months later, Philip's fleet defeated the Rhodians at the Battle of Lade. While Philip was plundering Pergamese territory and attacking cities in Caria, Attalus I of Pergamum went to Athens to try to create a diversion. He succeeded in securing an alliance with the Athenians, who immediately declared war on the Macedonians. The King of Macedon could not remain inactive; he assailed Athens with his navy and with some infantry. The Romans warned him, however, to withdraw or face war with Rome. After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Rhodian and Pergamese fleets, Philip withdrew, but not before attacking the city of Abydos on the Hellespont. Abydos fell after a long siege and most of its inhabitants committed suicide. Philip rejected the Roman ultimatum to stop attacking Greek states and the Romans declared war on Macedon. This left the Cretan cities with no major allies, and the largest city of Crete, Knossos, joined the Rhodians. Faced with this combination, both Hierapytna and Olous surrendered and were forced to sign a treaty favourable to Rhodes and Knossos. Prelude In 205 BC, the First Macedonian War came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Phoenice, under the terms of which the Macedonians were not allowed to expand westwards. Rome, meanwhile, was preoccupied with Carthage, and Philip hoped to take advantage of this to seize control of the Greek world. He knew that his ambitions would be aided by an alliance with Crete and began pressing the Cretans to attack Rhodian assets. Having crushed Pergamum, the dominant Greek state in Asia Minor, and formed an alliance with Aetolia, Philip was now opposed by no major Greek power other than Rhodes. Rhodes, an island state that dominated the south-eastern Mediterranean economically and militarily, was formally allied to Philip, but was also allied to his enemy Rome. Furthermore, Philip worked towards consolidating his position as the major power in the Balkans. Marching his forces to Macedon's northern frontier, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Illyrians, who lost 10,000 men in battle. With his northern frontier secured, Philip was able to turn his attention towards the Aegean Sea. Piracy and early campaigns The Treaty of Phoenice prohibited Philip from expanding westward into Illyria or the Adriatic Sea, so the king turned his attentions eastwards to the Aegean Sea, where he started to build a large fleet. Philip saw two ways of shaking Rhodes' dominance of the sea: piracy and war. Deciding to use both methods, he encouraged his allies to begin pirate attacks against Rhodian ships. Having already a foothold in Crete since the Lyttian War, Philip convinced the Cretans, who had been involved in piracy for a long time. He also persuaded the Aetolians, and the Spartans to take part in the piracy. The lure for these nations was the promise of vast loot from captured Rhodian vessels. He sent the Aetolian freebooter Dicaearchus on a large razzia through the Aegean, during the course of which he plundered the Cyclades and Rhodian territories. Additionally, Philip sought to weaken the Rhodians' naval capacity through subterfuge. He achieved this by sending his agent Heracleides to Rhodes where he succeeded in burning 13 boat-sheds. Philip V of Macedon, \\"the darling of Greece\\", the main antagonist of the war. By the end of 205 BC, Rhodes had been significantly weakened by these raids, and Philip saw his chance to go forward with the second part of his plan, direct military confrontation. He convinced the cities of Hierapytna and Olous and other cities in Eastern Crete to declare war against Rhodes. Rhodes' initial response to the declaration of war was diplomatic; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, but was unable to sway the city's war-weary population. At this point Philip further provoked Rhodes by attacking Cius, which was an Aetolian-allied city on the coast of the Sea of Marmara. Despite attempts by Rhodes and other states to mediate a settlement, Philip captured and razed Cius as well as its neighbour Myrleia. Philip then handed these cities over to his brother-in-law, the King of Bithynia, Prusias I who rebuilt and renamed the cities Prusa after himself and Apameia after his wife, respectively. In return for these cities Prusias promised that he would continue on expanding his kingdom at the expense of Pergamum (his latest war with Pergamum had ended in 205). The seizure of these cities also enraged the Aetolians, as both were members of the Aetolian League. The alliance between Aetolia and Macedon was held together only by the Aetolians' fear of Philip, and this incident worsened the already tenuous relationship. Philip next compelled the cities of Lysimachia and Chalcedon, which were also members of the Aetolian League, to break off their alliance with Aetolia probably through the threatened use of violence. Bust of Antiochus III in the Louvre. On the way home, Philip's fleet stopped at the island of Thasos off the coast of Thrace. Philip's general Metrodorus, went to the island's eponymous capital to meet emissaries from the city. The envoys said they would surrender the city to the Macedonians on the conditions that they not receive a garrison, that they not have to pay tribute or contribute soldiers to the Macedonian army and that they continue to use their own laws. Metrodorus replied that the king accepted the terms, and the Thasians opened their gates to the Macedonians. Once within the walls, however, Philip ordered his soldiers to enslave all the citizens, who were then sold away, and to loot the city. Philip's action during this campaign had a drastic impact on his reputation amongst the Greek states, where his actions were considered to be no better than the savage raids of the Aetolians and the Romans during the First Macedonian War. In 204 BC or the spring of 203 BC, Philip was approached by Sosibius and Agathocles of Egypt, the ministers of the young pharaoh Ptolemy V. The ministers sought to arrange a marriage between Ptolemy and Philip's daughter in order to form an alliance against Antiochus III the Great, emperor of the Seleucid Empire, who was seeking to expand his empire at Egypt's expense. Philip, however, declined the proposal and in the winter of 203‚Äì202 BC, he formed an alliance with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire. Philip agreed to help Antiochus to seize Egypt and Cyprus, while Antiochus promised to help Philip take control of Cyrene, the Cyclades and Ionia. In late 202 BC, the Aetolians sent ambassadors to Rome in order to form an alliance against Philip. Macedonian aggression had convinced the Aetolian League that they needed additional protectors in order to maintain their current position. However, the Romans rebuffed the Aetolian envoys as they were still seething about the fact that the Aetolians had come to terms with Philip to end the First Macedonian War. The unsupportive attitude of Rome encouraged Philip to continue with his Aegean campaign. Philip considered control of the Aegean to be paramount in maintaining his regional dominance. By ruling the Aegean he would be able to isolate Pergamum as well as restrict Roman attempts to interfere in the Eastern Mediterranean. War against Pergamum and Rhodes Hellenistic bust of Attalus I, King of Pergamum and nemesis of Philip V With the Seleucid treaty concluded, Philip's army attacked Ptolemy's territories in Thrace. Upon hearing that the King of Pergamum, Attalus I, had joined the Rhodian alliance, Philip became enraged and invaded Pergamese territory. However, before having set out to campaign against Philip's navy in the Aegean Sea, Attalus had strengthened the city walls of his capital. By taking this and other precautions, he hoped to prevent Philip from a seizing a large amount of booty from his territory. Seeing that the city was undermanned, he sent his skirmishers against it, but they were easily repelled. Judging that the city walls were too strong, Philip retreated after destroying a few temples, including the temple of Aphrodite and the sanctuary of Athena Nicephorus. After the Macedonians captured Thyatira, they advanced to plunder the plain of Thebe, but the booty proved less fruitful than anticipated. Once he arrived at Thebe, he demanded supplies from the Seleucid governor of the region, Zeuxis. Zeuxis, however, never planned to give Philip substantial supplies. After withdrawing from Pergamese land, Philip with the Macedonian fleet headed south and after subduing the Cyclades, took the island of Samos from Ptolemy V, capturing the Egyptian fleet stationed there. The fleet then turned north and laid siege to the island of Chios. Philip was planning to use the northern Aegean islands as stepping-stones as he worked his way down to Rhodes. The siege was not going well for Philip and the situation worsened as the combined fleets of Pergamum, Rhodes and their new allies, Kos, Cyzicus and Byzantium approached from both the north and south. Philip, comprehending that the allies were attempting to seal his line of retreat, lifted the siege and began to sail for a friendly harbour. However, he was confronted by the allied fleet, precipitating the Battle of Chios. The Macedonian fleet of around 200 ships, manned by 30,000 men, significantly outnumbered the coalition's fleet of sixty-five large warships, nine medium vessels and three triremes. The battle began with Attalus, who was commanding the allied left wing, advancing against the Macedonian right wing, while the allied right flank under the command of the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus attacked the Macedonian's left wing. The allies gained the upper hand on their left flank and captured Philip's flagship; Philip's admiral, Democrates, was slain in the fighting. Meanwhile, on the allied right flank, the Macedonians were initially successful in pushing the Rhodians back. Theophiliscus, fighting on his flagship, received three fatal wounds but managed to rally his men and defeat the Macedonian boarders. The Rhodians were able to use their superior navigational skills to incapacitate large numbers of Macedonian ships, swinging the battle back into their favour. On the allied left flank, Attalus saw one of his ships being sunk by the enemy and the one next to it in danger. He decided to sail to the rescue with two quadriremes and his flagship. Philip, however, whose ship had not been involved in the fighting to this point, saw that Attalus had strayed some distance from his fleet and sailed to attack him with four quinqueremes and three hemioliae. Attalus, seeing Philip approaching, fled in terror and was forced to run his ships aground. Upon landing he spread coins, purple robes and other splendid articles on the deck of his ship and fled to the city of Erythrae. When the Macedonians arrived at the shore, they stopped to collect the plunder. Philip, thinking that Attalus had perished in the chase, started towing away the Pergamese flagship. Following the flight of their monarch, the Pergamese fleet withdrew north. However, having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing, the Macedonian left wing disengaged and retreated to join its victorious right flank. The withdrawal of the Macedonian left permitted the Rhodians to sail unmolested back into Chios' harbour. While the battle was not decisive, it was a significant setback for Philip, who lost 92 ships destroyed and 7 captured. On the allied side, the Pergamese had three ships destroyed and two captured, while the Rhodians lost three ships sunk and none captured. During the battle the Macedonians lost 6,000 rowers and 3,000 marines killed and had 2,000 men captured. The casualties for the allies were significantly lower, with the Pergamese losing 70 men the Rhodians 60 killed, the allies as a whole losing 600 captured. Peter Green describes this defeat as \\"crippling and costly\\", with Philip sustaining more casualties than he had previously suffered in any battle. After this battle, the Rhodian admirals decided to leave Chios and sail back home. On the way back to Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he received at Chios, but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus on the shore of Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone. Asia Minor campaign Philip, disappointed by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or they would all be killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army was running out of food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession. While Philip's fleet was wintering in Bargylia, the combined Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour. The situation in the Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering. The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis. Philip, however, managed to get out by trickery. He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians to say that he was preparing to attack the allies the next day. Upon hearing the news, Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack. While the allies were making their preparations, Philip slipped past them by night with his fleet, leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp. While Philip was involved in this campaign, his allies the Acarnanians became involved in a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes. The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation, and he decided to send a force under the command of Nicanor the Elephant to assist them in their attack on Attica. The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome. Philip's fleet had just escaped from the allied blockade and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens. The Macedonian squadron sailed into Piraeus and captured four Athenian ships. As the Macedonian squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, appeared from the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which they returned to the Athenians. The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians. The Pergamese fleet sailed back to their base at Aegina and the Rhodians set out to conquer all the Macedonian islands from Aegina to Rhodes, successfully assaulting all except Andros, Paros and Cythnos. Philip ordered his prefect on the island of Euboea, Philoces, to assault Athens once again with 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Philocles was unable to capture Athens, but ravaged the surrounding countryside. Roman intervention Meanwhile, Rhodian, Pergamese, Egyptian, anti-Macedonian Cretan and Athenian delegations travelled to Rome to appear before the Senate. When they were given audience they informed the Senate about the treaty between Philip and Antiochus and complained of Philip's attacks on their territories. In response to these complaints the Romans sent three ambassadors, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Gaius Claudius Nero and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus to Egypt with the orders to go to Rhodes after speaking with Ptolemy. Map of the Thracian Chersonese While this was happening, Philip attacked and occupied the cities in Thrace which still belonged to Ptolemy, Maroneia, Cypsela, Doriscus, Serrheum and Aemus. The Macedonians then advanced on the Thracian Chersonese where they captured the cities of Perinthus, Sestos, Elaeus, Alopeconnesus, Callipolis and Madytus. Philip then descended to the city of Abydos, which was held by a combined Pergamese and Rhodian garrison. Philip started the siege by blockading the city by land and sea to stop attempts to reinforce or supply the city. The Abydenians, full of confidence, dislodged some of the siege engines with their own catapults while some of Philip's other engines were burnt by the defenders. With their siege weaponry in tatters, the Macedonians started undermining the city's walls, eventually succeeding in collapsing the outer wall. The situation was now grave for the defenders and they decided to send two of their most prominent citizens to Philip as negotiators. Appearing before Philip, these men offered to surrender the city to him on the conditions that the Rhodian and the Pergamese garrisons were allowed to leave the city under a truce and that all the citizens were permitted to leave the city with the clothes they were wearing and go wherever they pleased, in effect meaning an unconditional surrender. Philip replied that they should \\"surrender at discretion or fight like men.\\" The ambassadors, powerless to do more, carried this response back to the city.' Informed of this response, the city's leaders called an assembly to determine their course of action. They decided to liberate all slaves to secure their loyalty, to place all the children and their nurses in the gymnasium and to put all the women in the temple of Artemis. They also asked for everyone to bring forward their gold and silver and any clothes that were valuable so they could put them in the boats of the Rhodians and the Cyzicenes. Fifty elder and trusted men were elected to carry out these tasks. All the citizens then swore an oath. As Polybius writes: After reciting the oath, they brought forward the priests and everyone swore that they would defeat the enemy or die trying.' When the interior wall fell, the men, true to their promise, sprang from the ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip to send his troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp. That night the Abydenians resolved to save the women and children and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians, surrendering the city to Philip. Meanwhile, Attalus sailed across the Aegean to the island of Tenedos. The youngest of the Roman ambassadors, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, had heard about the siege at Abydos while he was in Rhodes and he arrived at Abydos to find Philip. Meeting the king outside the city, Lepidus informed him of the Senate's wishes. Polybius writes: While Philip was walking through Abydos, he saw people killing themselves and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three days' grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths. Philip then ordered another attack on Athens; his army failed to take either Athens or Eleusis, but subjected Attica to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign in order to deal with the Romans and the situation in Greece. Thus began the Second Macedonian War. After Philip's withdrawal from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians were free to attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies. Rhodes' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of Knossos saw that the war was going in Rhodes' favour and decided to join Rhodes in an attempt to gain supremacy over the island. Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered. Aftermath A map of the Aegean shortly after the war. Under the treaty signed at the conclusion of the war, Hierapytna agreed to break off all relations and alliances with foreign powers and to place all its harbors and bases at Rhodes' disposal. Olous, among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found, had to accept Rhodian domination. As a result, Rhodes was left with control of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war. The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War. The war had no particular short-term effect on the rest of Crete. Pirates and mercenaries there continued in their old occupations after the war's end. In the Battle of Cynoscephalae during the Second Macedonian War three years later, Cretan mercenary archers fought for both the Romans and the Macedonians. The war was costly for Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet that had taken three years to build as well as triggering the defection of their Greek allies, the Achean League and the Aetolian League, to the Romans. In the war's immediate aftermath the Dardani, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the northern border of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans and was forced to surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans. The Rhodians regained control over the Cyclades and reconfirmed their naval supremacy over the Aegean. The Rhodians' possession of eastern Crete allowed them to largely stamp out piracy in that area, but pirate attacks on Rhodian shipping continued and eventually led to the Second Cretan War. Attalus died in 197 and was succeeded by his son, Eumenes II, who continued his father's anti-Macedonian policy. The Pergamese, meanwhile, came out of the war having gained several Aegean islands which had been in Philip's possession and went on to become the supreme power in Asia Minor, rivaled only by Antiochus.

A dependable officer who had risen swiftly through the ranks, Hicks conducted liaison and military duties for Cook, including command of shore parties in Rio de Janeiro and the kidnapping of a Tahitian chieftain in order to force indigenous assistance in the recovery of deserters. Hicks' quick thinking while in temporary command of also saved the lives of Cook, Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander when they were attacked by MƒÅori in New Zealand in November 1769. Yet despite his vigorous service Hicks was dogged by ill health, which worsened as the voyage progressed. He died in May 1771 of a consumptive illness likely contracted before sailing from England, and his remains were buried at sea off the Atlantic island of Saint Helena. New Zealand's Hicks Bay and eastern Australia's Point Hicks are named in his honour. Zachary‚Äôs surname was usually, but not always, spelt Hicks in the journals of Cook and Banks. The family used the spelling Hickes, and Zachary‚Äôs commission has that spelling.  Early life and naval service  Hicks was born in Stepney in 1739.Beaglehole 1968, p. cxxx He enlisted or was pressed into military service at Ripon and first appears in navy muster-books as serving as able seaman and master's mate aboard from 1766.Beaglehole 1968, p. 591 A skilled seaman, he was promoted to midshipman aboard the sloop in August 1767, and to acting lieutenant on the same vessel in March 1768.Correspondence, Admiralty to Navy Board, 25 March 1768. Cited in Beaglehole 1968, p. 610 His officer's commission was formalised on 26 May 1768 with a transfer to James Cook's as second lieutenant and second-in-command.  Aboard Endeavour  =Outward voyage= Portuguese viceroy Ant√¥nio Rolim de Moura, on whose authority Hicks was detained in Rio de Janeiro Hicks' early months aboard Endeavour were uneventful. He is not mentioned in the journals of either Cook or the Royal Society supernumeraries Joseph Banks and Sydney Parkinson until Endeavour reached the Portuguese port of Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 1768. There Hicks was given his first specific duties by Cook: to put ashore in command of the ship's pinnace, to make contact with local authorities and to seek permission to replenish the ship's supplies. The engagement did not go well, as the Portuguese viceroy Ant√¥nio Rolim de Moura refused to believe that Endeavour was on a scientific mission. Instead, Hicks and master's mate Charles Clerke were detained on shore while answers were sought from Cook regarding his vessel, armaments and number of crew. The pinnace was returned to Endeavour without Hicks, and he and Clerke were only permitted to return to their ship after some hours' delay.Beaglehole 1968, pp. 22‚Äì23 On 19 November Hicks was again sent ashore, to present a letter from Cook to the viceroy. On arrival at Rio's docks he objected when a Portuguese soldier boarded his boat and refused to leave, at which point he and his crew were arrested and taken under guard from the shore.Beaglehole 1968, pp. 23‚Äì24 Portuguese authorities confiscated Endeavours pinnace and imprisoned the crew, sending Hicks back to his ship alone. After formal protests from Cook, Hicks' crew was released and the vessel returned but without its ensign flag which the Portuguese suggested had been lost. Portuguese authorities accused Hicks of threatening their soldiers' lives and of displaying \\"petulancy and imprudence\\"; they asked that he be confined to Endeavour and not return to shore.\\"Correspondence between the Conde de Azambuja, Vice Roy of the Estate of Brazil, and Lieutenant James Cook, Commander His Britannick Majesty's Ship Endeavour\\" (19‚Äì22 November 1768), cited in Beaglehole 1968, pp. 491‚Äì493 However Cook considered that Hicks had offered no provocation to Portuguese authorities that would justify their depriving him of his boat and command.Beaglehole 1968, p. 25 = Pacific exploration = Hicks' ship, HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland. By Samuel Atkins c. 1794 Departing Rio, Endeavour rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific to reach Tahiti in April 1769. Hicks' abilities as a leader were tested when, three days before Endeavour was due to depart, two of her marines deserted to the mountains to stay with their Tahitian \\"wives\\". Cook deputised Hicks to secure their return, ordering him to kidnap local chief Tootaha and three others in order to force the Tahitians to reveal where the deserters were hiding. The kidnapping was a success but the stratagem failed; the Tahitians responded by abducting Endeavours surgeon William Monkhouse and four of her crew, and holding them hostage near the shore.Hough 1995, pp. 131‚Äì132 Again Cook turned to Hicks, who led a strong detachment of marines to the shore and threatened that \\"the Chiefs would suffer for it\\"James Cook, cited in Beaglehole 1968, p. 116 if the hostages were not freed. Hicks' threat succeeded ‚Äì Monkhouse and the sailors were released, the Tahitians found and returned the deserters, and all were restored to Endeavour along with a peace offering of four pigs.Beaglehole 1968, p. 115 On 3 June Cook chose Hicks as one of the six men designated to record the Transit of Venus upon which Endeavours voyage was ostensibly based.Collingridge 2002, p. 136 Hicks joined First Mate Richard Pickersgill and Second Mate Charles Clerke on the eastward side of the island to time the beginning and end of the transit, but their figures did not match those of other observers. A disappointed Cook was forced to record the differing figures and settle on an average between them. Departing Tahiti, Hicks travelled onward with Endeavour into the uncharted waters of the South Pacific. He was credited with locating Hicks Bay in New Zealand, and then with being the first to see the mainland of Australia near today's Point Hicks (land was sighted on his morning watch). Cook recorded both those names after him. Endeavour made landfall in Botany Bay in eastern Australia on April 29, 1770. After the initial landing by Cook, Hicks was given command of the shore party with responsibility for collecting water and wood to resupply the ship.Beaglehole 1968, p. 306 In this role Hickes made the expedition's first sustained contact with indigenous Australians when more than a dozen gathered on the beach to watch his men collect water. Cook observed in his journal that \\"Mister Hicks did all in his power to entice them to him by offering them presents and company but it was to no purpose, all they seem'd to want was for us to be gone.\\" Hickes nonetheless persisted, with sufficient interaction over the following days for him to interpret a few words of the indigenous language. = Death = Hickes died of a consumptive lung infection on 26 May 1771, the third anniversary of his commission as lieutenant aboard Endeavour. As Cook recorded in his journal, the cause of Hickes' death was \\"a Consumption of which he was not free from when we saild from England so that it may be truly said that he hath been dieing ever sence, tho he held out tolerable well until we got to Batavia.\\"Beaglehole 1968, p. 471 His remains were buried at sea off the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, with what Cook described as \\"the usual ceremonies.\\"  Memorials  Hicks Bay on New Zealand's east coast. First sighted by Zachary Hicks from Endeavour deck, 31 October 1769 As an officer, Hicks was well regarded but not exceptional. Historian J. C. Beaglehole describes him as \\"a man of ability\\" but without \\"the chance to shine ... an invaluable man, probably, on any expedition; but perhaps born to be a lieutenant.\\" He is memorialised in the inscription on a monument at Point Hicks, which reads, \\"Lieutenant James Cook, R.N. of the Endeavour, first sighted Australia near this point which he named Point Hicks, after Lieutenant Zachary Hicks who first saw the land.\\" A matching inscription is affixed to the monument at the site of Cook's former cottage in Great Ayton in North Yorkshire. A street crescent in the Melbourne suburb of Endeavour Hills bears the name Zachary Hicks Crescent.  Notes  =Footnotes = In a note dated 2 May 1770, Isaac Smith, able seaman aboard Endeavour, recorded that Hicks had given him the following translations of indigenous speech: \\"boorwee\\" meaning three; \\"warregal\\" meaning dog; \\"mareeyang\\" meaning large bird; \\"mayanga\\" meaning to fly; \\"gong\\" meaning sun; \\"eednarda\\" meaning moon; \\"padoo\\" meaning water; \\"bemalle\\" meaning earth; and \\"gooiyong\\" meaning fire. =Citations= = References =   Further reading  * Ray Parkin, H.

Specifically it comprises the works of the two groups of people who settled the area, though during two different periods. They would in time however, come to interact and together reach even more remote islands. The area is often broken down into four separate regions: Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia and Australia. Australia, along with interior Melanesia (Papua), are populated by descendants of the first waves of human migrations into the region by Australo-Melanesians. Micronesia, Island Melanesia, and Polynesia, on the other hand, are descendants of later Austronesian voyagers who intermixed with native Australo-Melanesians; mostly via the Neolithic Lapita culture. All of the regions in later times would be greatly affected by western influence and colonization. In more recent times, the people of Oceania have found a greater appreciation of their region's artistic heritage. The artistic creations of these people varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Art such as masks were used in religious ceremonies or social rituals. Petroglyphs, Tattooing, painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Contemporary Pacific art is alive and well, encompassing traditional styles, symbols, and materials, but now imagined in a diversity of contemporary forms, revealing the complexity of geographic, cultural and individual interaction and history. Overview Split gong figures from Vanuatu Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island and Lebanon Dahia. The ancestors of the people of these islands came from Southeast Asia by two different groups at separate times. The first, an Australo-Melanesian people and the ancestors of modern-day Melanesians and Australian Aboriginals, came to New Guinea and Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Melanesians expanded as far as the northern Solomon Islands by 38,000 BC. The second wave, the ocean-voyaging Austronesian peoples from Southeast Asia, would not come for another 30,000 years. They would come to interact and together reach even the most remote Pacific islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.Met Timeline of Art History, Oceania, 80000-2000 B.C..

Map showing the migration and expansion of the Austronesian peoples in the Indo-Pacific By 1500 BC the Austronesian Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. The period from 1000 BC on, the Lapita people would consolidate and begin to create the contemporary Polynesian cultures of Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. They would from there venture further out into the Pacific and settle the Marquesas and northern Cook Islands between 200 BC and 1 AD. Additionally from about 1000 BC, trade between the Pacific Islands and mainland Asia was growing, and starting 600 BC, works of the Dongson culture of Vietnam, known for their bronze working, can be found in Oceania, and their imagery has a strong influence on the indigenous artistic tradition. Records to 1000 AD continue to be few, however most artistic tradition are continued to this point, such as New Guinea sculpture and Australian rock art, although the period is characterized by increasing trade and interaction as well as new areas being settled, including Hawaii, Easter Island, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 moai (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building Nan Madol, a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. By 1500, the first European explorers begin to reach Oceania. Although previous artistic and architectural traditions are continued, the various regions would begin to diverge and record more distinct cultures.Met Timeline of Art History, Oceania, 1000-1400 A.D..

Prehistoric The rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. These sites, found in Arnhem Land, Australia, are divided into three periods: Pre-Estuarine (c. 40,000?-6000 BC), Estuarine (c. 6000 BC-500 AD), and Fresh Water (c. 500 AD- present). They are dated based on the styles and content of the art. Pre- Estuarine, the oldest, is characterized by imagery in a red ocher pigment. However, by about 6000 BC, increasingly elaborate images begin to appear, marking the beginning of the Estuarine period. These rock paintings served several functions. Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. One of the more elaborate collections of rock art in this area is the site of Ubirr, a favored camping ground during wet seasons which has had its rock faces painted many times over thousands of years.Met Timeline of Art History Ubirr (40,000?B.C.-present).

Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC. The content of the sculptures fit into three categories: mortars, pestles, and freestanding figures. The tops of many pestles contain images, often of birds or human heads. Mortars show similar imagery, or sometimes geometric patterns. Freestanding figures again portray similar themes: humans, animals, and phalluses. The original significance of these pieces however, are unknown, but were perhaps used in the context of rituals.Met Timeline of Art History, Prehistoric Stone Sculpture from New Guinea.

Another early culture with an artistic tradition are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who are thought to be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of Polynesia and Island Melanesia. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in New Caledonia, which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and barkcloths. They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay.

Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of Nan Madol. The city began in 1200 AD, and is still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city however, undergoes a decline by around 1800 along with the Saudeleur dynasty, and is abandoned altogether by the 1820s. The 19th century would see the region divided up amongst the colonial powers, however art continued to thrive. Wood carving by men in particular flourishes in the region, creating richly decorated ceremonial houses in Belau, stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels, and sometimes sculptured figures. Women on the other hand created textiles and ornaments like bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality.Met Timeline of Art History Micronesia, 1800-1900 A.D..

But by the second half of the century, independence from colonial powers allows their traditional arts to find a renewed interest and respect from within the region, and a new generation are taught these art forms.

Polynesia, like Micronesia, stretched back to Lapita cultural traditions. Lapita Culture included parts of the western Pacific and reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa. However much of Polynesia, like the islands of Hawaii, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Easter Island, had only relatively recently been settled by indigenous peoples. The most famous Polynesian art forms are the Moai (statues) of Rapa Nui/Easter Island. Polynesian art is characteristically ornate, and often meant to contain supernatural power or mana. Polynesian works of art were thought to contain spiritual power and could affect change in the world. However the period beyond 1600 AD had seen intense interaction with European explorers, in addition to continuing earlier cultural traditions. The collections of European explorers during the period show that classical Polynesian art was indeed flourishing. In the 19th century, depopulation of areas due to slave raiding and Western diseases disrupted many societies and cultures. Missionary work in the region caused the conversion to Christianity, and in some cases the destruction of traditional cultural and artistic heritage of the region, specifically sculpture. However more secular art forms continue, such as carving non-religious objects like kava bowls and textile work such as tapa making. With the end of colonialism however, Polynesians increasingly attempted to assert their cultural identity.Met Timeline of Art History, 1900 A.D.-present. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.

Stylistically art is typically highly decorative and portrays exaggerated forms, often of sexual themes. It is mostly made in connection with ancestors, hunting, and cannibalism. Commonly they would be used in the context of spiritual rituals, such as the creation of elaborate masks. However, few examples of Melanesian art exist on the islands today. After 1600, like the other regions of Oceania, saw increasing encounters with European explorers. What they witnessed was a flourishing tradition of art and culture, such as the first record of the region's elaborate wood carving. It isn't until the latter half of the 19th century, however, that westernization begins to takes its toll. Some traditional forms of art go into decline, but others like sculpture survive and even thrive in the region. Not until more of the islands were explored by the western powers that the sheer diversity of Melanesian art begins to be seen. By the 20th century, Melanesian art begins to find its way to the West and has a profound impact on contemporary artists. However a great cultural disruption would follow the second World War, and much traditional art would begin to decline or be destroyed. This would be followed decades later by a newfound appreciation for their native art forms.Met Timeline of Art History, Melanesia, 1900 A.D.-present. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.

In the United States, the vast majority of mortgages are backed by the government or government-sponsored entities (GSEs) through purchase by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae (which purchases loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)). Because GSEs and private loan investors typically do not service the mortgage loans that they purchase, the bank who sells the mortgage will generally retain the right to service the mortgage pursuant to a master servicing agreement. The payments collected by the mortgage servicer are remitted to various parties; distributions typically include paying taxes and insurance from escrowed funds, remitting principal and interest payments to investors holding mortgage-backed securities (or other types of instruments backed by pools of mortgage loans), and remitting fees to mortgage guarantors, trustees, and other third parties providing services. The level of service varies depending on the type of loan and the terms negotiated between the servicer and the investor seeking their services, and may also include activities such as monitoring delinquencies, workouts/ restructurings and executing foreclosures. In exchange for performing these activities, the servicer generally receives contractually specified servicing fees and other ancillary sources of income such as float and late charges. Mortgage servicing became \\"far more profitable during the housing boom\\", and some servicers targeted borrowers \\"less likely to make timely payments\\" in order to collect more late fees. Overview Servicers (servicing companies) are normally compensated by receiving a percentage of the unpaid balance on the loans they service. The fee rate can be anywhere from one to forty-four basis points depending on the size of the loan, whether it is secured by commercial or residential real estate, and the level of service required. Those services can include (but aren't limited to) statements, impounds, collections, tax reporting, and other requirements. Companies recognize servicing rights as distinct assets or liabilities when ownership of those rights is contractually separated from ownership of the underlying loan. The value recognized for servicing rights is based on the net present value of the expected cash flows received from servicing less the amount that would be required to adequately compensate a servicer (this incorporates an expected cost of servicing plus a profit margin required by market participants). The value of servicing assets or liabilities is highly interest-rate sensitive due to the relationship between interest rates and expected prepayments (i.e., loan refinancing). This is because when a loan is refinanced the servicing fees and other benefits of servicing cease, making the value of these assets extremely volatile. For this reason, companies that hold large amounts of servicing rights tend to hedge the value of those servicing rights using interest rate sensitive derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and swaptions. In order for these companies to exist, they need to utilize software. There are many loan servicing software companies and they tend to focus on a specific industry, such as community development financial institution (CDFIs), commercial loans, residential loans, and multi-family loans. To provide these solutions vendors work with companies and design the systems around their complexities. Some of these systems can be thousands of programs and can be considered some of the most complex software systems ever built.  Companies involved Wells Fargo, PNC Financial Services, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Vervent, Ocwen Financial Corporation, SN Servicing Corporation, Essex Financial Services and Carrington are examples of large companies involved in the loan servicing industry.Wagner D.

Craven, the great-great-granddaughter of Commodore Tingey, and commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 January 1904, Lt. John Francis Marshall in command. Service history =1904-1917= Tingey then joined the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla at its base at the Norfolk Navy Yard and remained there for the first third of her Navy career. For the most part, she lay tied up at pierside; but, periodically she got underway to insure her material readiness should a need for her services ever arise. By 1908, she was reassigned to the 3rd Torpedo Flotilla, but she remained relatively inactive at Norfolk. In 1909, she was listed as a unit of the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. However, all three organizations to which she was assigned appear simply to have been different names for the same duty ‚Äî lying at pierside in reserve. Sometime late in 1909, Tingey moved south from Norfolk to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was promptly placed in reserve again on 22 December 1909. The torpedo boat remained at Charleston, in various conditions of reserve, but apparently always still in commission. Infrequently, she got underway to test her machinery. In 1917, Tingey moved north to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was placed out of commission on 8 March 1917. =1917-1919= A month later on 7 April 1917, she was recommissioned and moved further north to patrol the coastal waters of the 1st Naval District during the period the United States participated in World War I. In September 1918, the torpedo boat's name was canceled so that it could be given to Destroyer No. 272, one of the new s. The older vessel then became Coast Torpedo Boat No. 17. Two months later, Germany sued for the armistice which ended hostilities. =Decommissioning and sale= Coast Torpedo Boat No. 17 was placed out of commission at Philadelphia on 30 January 1919, and she was struck from the Navy List on 28 October 1919.

Early life Bowerman was born in Hesper, Iowa, the son of Daniel and Lydia (Battey) Bowerman. He received his early education in public schools and moved to Salem, Oregon in 1893. Bowerman entered Willamette University in 1893, and graduated with a law degree in 1896. He was admitted to the Oregon Bar the following year, practicing law in Salem until 1899. He then moved to Condon, in Gilliam County, Oregon, where he lived for the next 12 years. There he became a law partner of H. H. Henricks. Bowerman's service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War briefly interrupted his practice of law. Political career Bowerman was a Republican. He was elected to the Oregon State Senate from Gilliam County in 1904 and was reelected four years later. He served as president of that body from 1909 to 1911. When Governor Frank W. Benson was incapacitated by ill health in June 1910, he asked Bowerman, as president of the Senate, to assume gubernatorial responsibilities. On June 16, 1910, at age thirty-three, Bowerman became Acting Governor. Mindful of the bureaucracy of a large administration, Bowerman advocated the establishment of a Board of Control to administer the state institutions, which would permit fiscal savings by combined purchasing for state institutions through the office of a single purchasing agent. However, the Board of Control was not established until the administration of his successor. He also acted to reduce the risk of loss through bank failure by prohibiting Oregon bankers from the use of speculative stock as assets if they had actively promoted that stock. In 1904, the citizens of Oregon adopted a direct primary law prohibiting party nominating conventions. Establishment Republicans, unwilling to relinquish party control over nominations, held an \\"assembly\\" in 1910 at which they nominated Bowerman as their candidate for governor. Bowerman's Democratic gubernatorial rival, Oswald West, cast him as an opponent of the Oregon System of direct government. Bowerman campaigned on a platform supporting modernized highway systems, increased economies in the administration of government, and continued tight control of state land management. Bowerman was also involved in a sex scandal, having an affair with his secretary. West defeated him 54,853 votes to 48,751. Later life After leaving the office of governor on January 8, 1911, Bowerman moved to Portland, where he resumed the practice of law. He was reelected president of the State Senate but retired following the 1911 session. As a private citizen he actively supported Oregon's first statewide bond issue for highway construction, a $6,000,000 proposal. He also served as an active lobbyist for years at the State Legislature. Bowerman died in Portland in 1957, and was buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Portland, Oregon. Personal life From an early age, Bowerman was estranged from his father. Bowerman married Elizabeth Hoover in 1903 and they had four children. Bill Bowerman became a well-known track and field coach at the University of Oregon, as well as coach of the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. He co-founded Nike, Inc. with Phil Knight. Bowerman and Elizabeth eventually divorced, and Bowerman married Wayfe Hockett in 1914. This marriage produced two children.

One day they walked by a pond, and Silver-Tree asked a trout if she were the most beautiful queen in the world, whereupon the trout said that Gold-Tree was more beautiful. Silver-Tree took to her bed and declared she would never be well unless she ate Gold-Tree's heart and liver. A king's son had asked to marry Gold-Tree, so her father agreed and sent them off; then he gave his wife the heart and liver of a he-goat, at which she got up from her bed. Silver-Tree went back to the trout, which told her Gold-Tree was still more beautiful, and living abroad with a prince. Silver-Tree begged a ship of her husband to visit her daughter. The prince was away hunting; Gold-Tree was terrified at the sight of the ship. The servants locked her away in a room so she could tell her mother she could not come out. Silver-Tree persuaded her to put her little finger through the keyhole, so she could kiss it, and when Gold-Tree did, Silver-Tree stuck a poisoned thorn into it. When the prince returned, he was grief-stricken, and could not persuade himself to bury Gold-Tree, because she was so beautiful. He kept her body in a room. Having married for a second time, he would not let his new wife into the room. One day, he forgot the key, and the new wife went in. She tried to wake Gold-Tree, and found the thorn in her finger. Pulling it out, she revived Gold-Tree. Because of the wakened one's identity, the second wife offered to leave, but their husband refused to allow it. Silver-Tree went back to the trout, who told her what had happened. Silver-Tree took the ship again. The prince was hunting again, but the second wife said that the two of them must meet her. Silver-Tree offered a poisoned drink. The second wife said that it was the custom that the person who offered the drink drank of it first. Silver-Tree put the drink to her mouth, and the second wife struck her arm so that some went into her throat. She fell down dead. The prince, Gold- Tree, and the second wife lived happily thereafter.

Similar to non-breeding hoary-headed grebes, which share a similar range. Behaviour The Australasian grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver, and usually dives immediately when alarmed and swims away under water. They are not strong flyers and will fly distances only at night, presumably to avoid predators. They tend not to leave their home base if there is sufficient food. If disturbed they will dive and re-surface 10‚Äì15 metres away rather than fly. Both parents will raise the chicks; however, the male will leave after a couple of months when the chicks are about three-quarters grown. Initially the young will ride on the parents back, hidden between their slightly raised wings. When the chicks begin to dive and feed themselves (at about 10 weeks) the mother may leave too, although mothers have been known to return soon after, apparently to check on the chicks. The parents are very protective and will try to drive away other water birds (ducks, herons) by confronting them and flapping their wings wildly or using their wings to splash water at the intruders.

Since 1983, Groce has served as the host and artistic director of Mountain Stage, a two-hour live music radio program produced by West Virginia Public Broadcasting and distributed by NPR. He first entered the national spotlight in 1976 when his novelty song \\"Junk Food Junkie\\" became a Top Ten hit. After that, Groce's voice became well known by children and parents alike as a result of his Platinum recordings of classic children's songs for Walt Disney Records Children‚Äôs Favorites four-volume series: Volume 1 (1979), Volume 2 (1979), Volume 3 (1986), and Volume 4 (1990). Early life Groce was born in 1948 in Dallas, Texas, to H.T. and Bobbie Groce. He had a younger brother, Gary (born July 7, 1951), and a younger sister, Janna (born April 8, 1961). Groce became interested in music while in elementary school. The family resided in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, and he attended Adamson High School there. Classmates included singer-songwriters Michael Martin Murphey, Ray Wylie Hubbard and B. W. Stevenson. Career Groce‚Äôs first album, a collection of hymns called Peace and Joy and Power for The First Church of Christ, Scientist, of which he is a member, was recorded in 1969 while he was still a college student at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. After graduating in 1970, he moved to New York and became a regular performer at a ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù, an Upper West Side organic food restaurant and coffeehouse co-owned by future Hollywood producer and manager Larry Brezner. (Brezner‚Äôs wife at that time, musician Melissa Manchester, was also a regular.) Later that year, Groce signed a recording contract with Daybreak Records, a subsidiary of RCA Records. His first album of original songs, The Wheat Lies Low, was released in 1970. From 1972 to 1985 he was a National Endowment for the Arts sponsored \\"musician-in-residence\\", visiting schools in twenty US states. One of those residencies brought him to West Virginia in 1972, where he continues to make his home. In 1976, his satiric novelty song \\"Junk Food Junkie\\" became a Billboard top-ten hit and led to appearances on The Tonight Show, The Merv Griffin Show, American Bandstand, The Midnight Special, The Rich Little Show, Nashville Now, The Disney Channel, Dr. Demento, and A Prairie Home Companion. Between 1979 and 1990, Groce performed on nine Disney albums, one of which was certified gold and five certified platinum. His first Disney recording, Winnie-the-Pooh for President, was nominated for a Grammy in the category of ‚ÄúBest Recording for Children‚Äù in 1976, and Disney‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Favorites Volumes I‚ÄìIV remain in print and continue to sell. In 1983, Groce co-founded Mountain Stage, a two-hour live music program produced by West Virginia Public Radio and distributed nationally and internationally by NPR and Voice of America's satellite radio service to over 200 stations. He is its host, producer and artistic director. His musical tastes have been instrumental in defining the sound of the show. Mountain Stage was the first nationally broadcast radio or television program to feature live performances by Lyle Lovett, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Sheryl Crow, Barenaked Ladies, Alison Krauss, Ani DiFranco, Phish, Counting Crows, Ben Harper, Ryan Adams, Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams, David Gray, and The Avett Brothers. The show has also featured musical pioneers such as Bill Monroe, Ralph Stanley, Doc Watson, Pops Staples and Brownie McGhee as well as modern superstars R.E.M., Martina McBride and Norah Jones. In 2016, Groce released his first recording in 27 years Live Forever with his wife, violist Sandra Groce. It includes four originals and eight covers, and includes the full version of the Mountain Stage theme song, \\"Simple Song.\\" =Side projects= In 1990, he starred in Paradise Park, a low budget feature film made in West Virginia about life in a Mountain State trailer park. (It was later re- released as Heroes of the Heart.) Groce also co-wrote the title song with Webb Wilder, who also appeared in the film with country musicians Porter Wagoner and Johnny Paycheck. Groce co-wrote a musical theatre version. Groce owned The Morgantown School of Ballet from 1980 to 1985. He was part owner of West Virginia's only statewide arts and entertainment alternative tabloid, Graffiti, from 1990 until 2004. In 2005, he became Executive Director of FestivALL Charleston, a ten-day festival of music, dance, theater and visual arts in West Virginia‚Äôs capital city Charleston.

It is situated on an old and important two-track road from Jamba to Huambo. Established as an ore mine and during the Civil War allegedly used as Namibian guerrilla training site and refugee camp, the place was the scene of the Battle of Cassinga, an airborne raid by the South African Defence Force against the People's Liberation Army of Namibia on 4 May 1978 that killed several hundred SWAPO fighters, Cuban soldiers and Namibian refugees. The settlement is a place of reverence and pilgrimage by both belligerents of the battle. Namibians celebrate Cassinga Day as a national holiday. SWAPO and the MPLA claimed the battle was a massacre of a refugee camp. The battle is thus regarded the turning point in the fight for Namibian independence, which then started drawing support from a wider segment of the population. South Africans celebrate a \\"jewel of military craftmanship\\" and a major blow against armed efforts to achieve Namibian independence. History =Before Independence= One of the exploratory travels of the Dorsland Trek crossed Cassinga in 1874. There is still a monument remembering those trekboere that died during that trip. Located near the site is an old iron mine constructed by Krupp engineers working in concert with the colonial administration. Between 1966 and 1967, a second terminal for extracting the ore was completed at Saco, a bay just 12 kilometres north of Mo√ß√¢medes by Compania Mineira do Lobito, the Lobito Mining Company. Cassinga's product would eventually be channeled to Saco under direction of Portuguese authorities. Development of the installation was trusted to Krupp and SETH, a Portuguese subsidiary of Denmark's H√∏jgaard & Schultz. Mo√ß√¢medes housed expatriate workers, the foreign engineers, and their families for two years until the first 250,000 tons of ore were shipped out in 1967. At that time Cassinga had about twenty buildings serving as warehouses, accommodation and offices. =During the Civil War= Cassinga continued to thrive until Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. Abandoned by its European supervisors, the mine and the settlement quickly fell into neglect during the ensuing Angolan Civil War. It is located about halfway from Huambo to the South-West African border where the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), the military wing of the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO), launched guerrilla attacks. After using the ghost town as a stopover point for a few weeks, a PLAN squad led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied the place. Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles. The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South-West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people. UNICEF reported of a \\"well-run and well-organized\\" camp but \\"ill-equipped\\" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978. The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga. According to SADF intelligence, \\"Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga. Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga.\\" Victims of the 1978 raid, Cassinga. By 1978, PLAN's presence had attracted the attention of the South African Defence Force. Executing a massive external raid (dubbed Operation Reindeer) involving paratroops of the 44 Parachute Regiment supported by bomber and strike aircraft, South Africa briefly occupied Cassinga on 4 May 1978. The assault, which left sixty Cuban military advisers and over five hundred South West African exiles dead, is now called Battle of Cassinga has been subject to international controversy. Angolan officials subsequently flew in a team of international journalists who photographed mass graves on site, verifying several bodies as women and children in civilian dress. Indignant at claims that its personnel had committed a war crime, the SADF continued to maintain that the defenders were uniformed PLAN combatants.Edward George, The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991: From Che Guevara to Cuito Cuanavale. Psychology Press, 2004. The Angolan government counted 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants. Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children. Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers, and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established. A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded. The Namibians abandoned the camp after the attacks and moved their headquarters to Lubango. the site of the battle is still partly mined, and the mass graves have fallen into disrepair. Cassinga was the site of more fighting during Operation Askari, in late 1983. After driving back several Angolan units with air support and mechanised infantry, the SADF finally occupied the area for the second time on 22 December.Focus on Political Repression in Southern Africa. International Defence & Aid Fund, 1983, Volume 1 Issues 44-45 p. 12.

He is most widely known for his voice-over work for the long-running Nine Network comedy variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday from 1971 until 1999 and then returning for the reunion specials in 2009 and brief relaunch in 2010. Biography Blackman grew up in the Victorian suburb of Mount Waverley, where he attended Syndal Primary School until 1959 and completed year 10 at Syndal Technical School in 1963. He was an avid supporter of the Fitzroy Football Club, now the Brisbane Lions. On leaving school (and home) at 16, he worked in a succession of occupations: customs clerk, cash van salesman for a cigarette distributor, sales representative for a perfume company, and spruiker in the Myer Bargain Basement. At the age of 22, he decided on a career in radio. He has worked in radio since 1969 but is probably best known for his 28-year stint as announcer and character voice-over for the Nine Network's Hey Hey It's Saturday, Australia's longest running variety show. One of his best known characters was a stick puppet known as \\"Dickie Knee\\". In 1969, he joined 2GN Goulburn as an announcer, newsreader, copy writer, salesman, and record librarian. In 1970, he joined 2CA Canberra where he worked in a variety of on-air shifts for 18 months until mid-1971, when he joined 3AW in Melbourne. As evening announcer, Blackman worked with the Reverend Alex Kenworthy for a number of years on \\"Nightline\\". In 1974, he joined 3AK where he hosted the morning show until 1975, when he moved to Sydney to join 2UE as a \\"floating\\" announcer for just three months. At TCN-9 in Sydney, he was a staff continuity announcer and daytime newsreader for National Nine News alongside his work on Hey Hey It's Saturday, which he would do \\"down the line\\" to GTV-9 in Melbourne every Saturday from an announcing booth at TCN-9. He returned to 3AK Melbourne in 1979 to host the breakfast show until 1981. Later that year, he joined 3AW to host their breakfast show with Paul Barber. After Barber parted company with 3AW not long afterwards, Blackman was joined by former ATV-0 newsreader and staff announcer, Bruce Mansfield. This collaboration became one of the most successful combinations in Australian radio history, with 3AW breakfast topping the ratings for 5 consecutive years until 1986. After leaving 3AW in controversial circumstances on 30 April 1986, Blackman became part of the short-lived, ill-fated CBC Network (2UE/3AK) experiment and, in December of that year, his contract was not renewed. From 1987 to 1990, he co-hosted a breakfast show on 3UZ (now RSN Racing & Sport) with Coodabeen Champions member Ian Cover and later, Wilbur Wilde. In 1997, after a 7-year hiatus from radio Blackman was employed as the co-host of the 3AK breakfast show with Anna \\"Pinky\\" Pinkus and Denis Donoghue (Lawyers, Guns & Money) until 2000. In 2004, he joined Triple M Adelaide and was co-host of The John Blackman & Jane Reilly Breakfast Show until December 2007. Other television shows Blackman has appeared on and announced for include Blankety Blanks, Personality Squares, The Paul Hogan Show, The Daryl Somers Tonight Show, Holiday Island, Family Feud and many others. Blackman was interviewed on ABC's Talking Heads in 2006. In 2009 Blackman returned as part of the Hey Hey It's Saturday reunion specials to revive his voice-over role. Despite respectable ratings, the show's contract was not renewed for 2011. From April 2015 to May 2016, he was employed at MAGIC 1278 in Melbourne and MAGIC 882 in Brisbane as their Breakfast Announcer between 6.00am and 10.00am, initially as co-host with Jane Holmes who resigned in April 2015 for personal reasons. Blackman continued in a solo role until May 2016, when he was unceremoniously dumped by Macquarie Media Ltd. According to MML COO, Adam Lang, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a very respected and highly regarded broadcaster but his style of broadcasting, while excellent, wasn‚Äôt working on the MAGIC format.‚Äù Significantly, in the third radio survey for 2016, (released a few days later) Blackman actually increased his Melbourne audience from 1.5% to 2.2% and his cumulative audience to 19,000 listeners (2,000 more than the station average). Corporate work Blackman is a corporate host and compere for a variety of business award nights, conferences and social occasions. He also regularly voices radio and television advertisements. Writing Blackman has authored several books including Aussie Slang, Aussie Gags (1998) and More Aussie Gags, Don't Come the Raw Prawn, Best of Aussie Slang, Aussie Slang Dictionary and the Dickie Knee Bumper Comic Book.

The Fernandina Beach Historic District was included on the National Register on July 20, 1973 and encompasses approximately 1,500 acres (610 ha), bounded by North 9th Street, Broome, Ash, South 5th Street, Date, and South 8th Street. On April 20, 1987, the National Register listing was expanded to include an additional 970 acres (3.9 km¬≤), bounded by Sixth, Broome, North 3rd, & Escambia Streets; Seventh & Date Streets, and Ash. Approximately 300 buildings are included in this district. David Levy Yulee, one of the first United States senators from Florida, established the first cross-state railroad running from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key, which opened on March 1, 1861. When Yulee established the railroad, he platted \\"new\\" Fernandina, shifting the town of Fernandina to its present location. Prior to this, Fernandina was located further north in what is now known as Old Town, or the Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site, also on the National Register of Historic Places. The railroad development, in addition to the bustling maritime industry along the Amelia River waterfront, caused \\"new\\" Fernandina to boom. Buildings in the Fernandina Beach Historic District reflect this late 19th and early 20th century development. Significant buildings within the Historic District include the Nassau County Courthouse, the Post Office, the Train Depot, Public School No. 1, St. Peter's Episcopal Church, the First Presbyterian Church, St. Michael's Catholic Church and Academy, the Waas House, the Fairbanks House, the Tabby House, and the Bailey House. Residential architecture is most commonly frame vernacular style, often with Queen Anne influences. Robert Schulyer, a well-known architect in northeast Florida, designed St. Peter's and Public School No. 1. The Post Office is credited to James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the United States Department of Treasury from 1897 to 1912. The City of Fernandina Beach recognized the importance of the Historic District in telling the story of Fernandina's heritage, and in 1975 passed a historic preservation ordinance protecting this district by establishing local boundaries. The ordinance also created design guidelines for rehabilitation and construction projects on the historic buildings, and in addition created the City's Historic District Council, who reviews the projects. In 1985 and again in 2007, the City had the Historic District professionally surveyed to inventory the historic buildings. The ordinance and City land development regulations have been updated periodically to reflect contemporary historic preservation practices and to include updated information based on the surveys. The John Denham Palmer House, Amelia Island Lighthouse, and Peck High School have also all been individually included in the local historic district boundaries. The Historic District is home to shops, restaurants, bed and breakfasts, and residences. The Amelia Island Museum of History is directly adjacent to the District, and Fort Clinch and the beach are within a short distance east. Each year in May, the Isle of Eight Flags Shrimp Festival takes place in the Historic District, attracting thousands of visitors.

He demonstrated that children are not innocent in their play and that adults are indeed guilty in theirs. In both cases play pretends to assist them in surmounting their Darwinian struggles for survival. His book Play As Emotional Survival is a response to his own deconstruction of play theories in his work, The Ambiguity of Play (1997, Harvard University Press). Sutton-Smith's interdisciplinary approach included research into play history and cross cultural studies of play, as well as research in psychology, education, and folklore. He maintained that the interpretation of play must involve all of its forms, from child's play to gambling, sports, festivals, imagination, and nonsense.  Biography  alt= Brian Sutton-Smith was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1924. He trained as a teacher, completed a BA and MA, and was then awarded the first Education PhD in New Zealand in 1954. Following the completion of his PhD, Sutton-Smith travelled to the USA on grant from the Fulbright Program, where he began an academic career with a focus on children's games, adult games, children's play, children's drama, films and narratives, as well as children's gender issues and sibling position. Sutton- Smith was the author of some 50 books, the most recent of which is The Ambiguity of Play, and some 350 scholarly articles. He served as president of The Anthropological Association for the Study of Play and of The American Psychological Association, Division g10 (Psychology and the Arts). As a founder of the Children's Folklore Society he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Folklore Society. For his research in toys he received awards from the BRIO and Lego toy companies of Sweden and Denmark. He participated in making television programs on toys and play in Great Britain, Canada, and the U.S., and was a consultant for Captain Kangaroo, Nickelodeon, Murdoch Children's Television, and the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia. His academic life consisted of 10 years at Bowling Green State University, Ohio, 10 years at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York, and 17 years at the University of Pennsylvania. He then retired to Sarasota, Florida. He died of Alzheimer's disease on March 7, 2015 in White River Junction, Vermont.\\"Brian Sutton Smith Obituary\\" Valley News, West Lebanon, NH, March 10, 2015. Sutton-Smith had recently been engaged as resident scholar at The Strong in Rochester, New York, home to the Brian Sutton-Smith Library and Archives of Play. In addition, the New Zealand Association for Research in Education has created the Sutton-Smith Doctoral Award, which will be awarded annually for an excellent Doctoral thesis by an NZARE member. The Ambiguity of Play In The Ambiguity of Play, Sutton-Smith details seven \\"rhetorics\\" of play, or ideologies that have been used to explain, justify, and privilege certain forms of play. These seven rhetorics are progress, fate, power, (community) identity, imaginary, self, and frivolity. Three of these‚Äîfate, power, and identity‚ÄîSutton-Smith identifies as ancient but still active and associates with a more collective focus. Another three are more recent, associated with a modern focus on the individual: progress, imaginary, and self. Sutton-Smith argues that the seventh rhetoric, frivolity, serves as a responsive rhetoric, in the sense that nonhegemonic forms of play are often deemed frivolous. In the conclusion, Sutton-Smith notes that variation is one of play's key features, with important resemblance to biological variation. While acknowledging that he is advancing a version of the progress narrative of play, Sutton-Smith posits that play may serve an important role in evolutionary adaptation.

Initially published in serial form in 1949 in the New Zealand School Journal, the stories created a national furor as Brian Sutton-Smith allegedly endorsed morally unacceptable behavior in them.

The show began on radio in 19541954 at nzhistory.net and was hosted and directed by Selwyn Toogood. In the 1970s a television version of the show was developed which was also hosted by Toogood until his retirement in the 1980s. After his retirement, John Hawkesby took over hosting duties. The show was discontinued in 1990 but returned for a final season in 1992 now hosted by Nick Tansley Toogood's catch phrases from this show included \\"by hokey!\\", \\"what should he/she do, New Zealand?\\" and \\"the money or the bag?\\" The hostesses of the show also became popular celebrities. The hostess' role was to introduce the contestants and announce and fetch the prizes. Hostess of the last part of the radio era and first television hostess was Heather Eggleton. Other hostesses of the television era included Tineke Stephenson (formerly Tineke Bouchier) and Hilary Timmins. The game Unlike other game shows instead of being filmed in a single studio the show went on the road to a different town each week and the set was assembled into a local community town hall. The contestants were locals selected from the audience by a pre-show qualifying process. During the show, each contestant would be called onto the stage and asked three relatively easy questions. If all three questions were answered correctly, the contestant had the chance to play for \\"the money or the bag\\". The contestant would first be asked to select one of thirty different bags. Each bag contained a prize unknown to both the contestant and the host. The prizes ranged in value from moderate to valuable, and also included three 'booby prizes' of negligible value, such as a clothes peg. The top bag was known as Super Bag this bag contained a prize of high value or several items equally a high value, there was just one Super Bag. The host of the show would then offer the contestant an increasing amount of cash in exchange for their unopened bag. The offers would continue until the contestant either accepted the cash or the host chose to stop offering more money. If they chose the bag, it would be opened at that point and their prize revealed. If the contestant chose the money the prize the contestant turned down would be revealed. In the television version of the show, the final round was the 'Travel Bag' round in which one of the previously-appearing contestants would be randomly selected to compete. In this round, the contestant would be asked ten quite difficult questions. The contestant who had answered the most correctly at the end of each season would win the prize -- a valuable travel-related prize such as a round-the-world trip, a matching set of travel luggage, and video camera. The last segment of the show consisted of the host going into the audience and selecting a participant. That lucky person would not be asked any questions but would otherwise participate in the normal bag selection and bidding process. The show also contained a Post Bag segment at the start where viewers across all of New Zealand would mail in a cash bid by post. An entry would be drawn on the show with the \\"Money or the Bag\\" process run through until the offer by the presenter exceeded the bid in which case the entrant would take the money, or until the presenter reached a limit and in this case the entrant would take the prize in the bag. In the final 1992 series Post Bag was replaced by Phone Bag contestants now phoned in their bids to an 0900 number prior to the show, an entry was still drawn on each show with the process the same as the Post Bag. Return to TV Television New Zealand's new TVNZ 6 channel began screenings of selected Selwyn Toogood and John Hawkesby episodes when the channel began transmission on the new Freeview service on September 30, 2007. In 2009 Maori Television began a new revival of the show, hosted by Pio Terei and Stacey Morrison. The first episode went to air on May 31, 2009.

Namur was on his way to join Edward III on his invasion of Scotland, when he was intercepted on the common grazing ground to the south of Edinburgh - the Borough Muir. The fighting continued into the city itself, and concluded in a desperate struggle in the ruins of the old castle. Randolph was victorious in a fight which forms a small part of the Second War of Scottish Independence. The Great Invasion Ever since 1332 a part of Anglo-Scots nobles, known collectively as the 'disinherited', had been trying to establish Edward Balliol, son and heir of John Balliol, on the throne of Scotland in place of David II. These men, who had fought against Robert Bruce during the First war of Independence, were given the active support of the English. Yet despite two remarkable victories at the Battle of Dupplin Moor and the Battle of Halidon Hill, which came close to exterminating the governing class of Scotland, the Balliol party was not strong-or popular- enough to establish itself by its own means. Twice Edward Balliol had been seated on the Scottish throne, and twice had he been toppled off. In 1335 King Edward decided to make one great effort on behalf of his hapless and unlucky prot√©g√©, coming to Scotland himself at the head of an army, the largest to enter the country since his father came to Edinburgh in 1322. By the second week of July the king had over 13000 men in arms at Newcastle. He was joined there by Edward Balliol, coming from Carlisle. A council of war was held and it was decided that Scotland would be enveloped in a vast pincer movement by land and sea. The army was divided in two: Edward was to command the invasion of Scotland from Carlisle, while Balliol moved northwards from Berwick. His progress would be supported by a strong naval force moving up the east coast towards the Firth of Tay, while Edward would have similar support from a force sailing from Ireland into the Firth of Clyde. The purpose of the invasion was to find and destroy the Scottish army in the field, rather than take castles. Edward marched through Nithsdale, bypassing Loch Doon castle, still held for King David, and overran Carrick, Cunninghame and Kyle. In the meantime, Balliol moved quickly up the east coast into Lothian. Like a plague of biblical locusts his army consumed everything in its path. Letters of protection issued by Edward himself did nothing to protect Newbattle Abbey or Manuel Nunnery from destruction. In the Firth of Forth the abbey on the island of Inchcolm was destroyed by the English navy, which then proceeded north into the Tay, landing at Dundee, setting the town and its Franciscan friary alight. The looting and destruction of the friary caused the English author of the Lanercost Chronicle to drop his usual patriotic cloak and express his disapproval in a brief flourish of Christian solidarity. Towards the end of July the land arms of the pincer joined at Glasgow, having caught nothing of substance in their embrace and from there marched on to Perth. The driving force behind the Scottish resistance was the Earl of Moray. Not strong enough to face the enemy in direct attack; he limited his actions to small-scale operations in the rear of the main English army, attacking supply columns and the like. The opportunity for more decisive action came about the time Edward and Balliol were meeting up at Glasgow. Will You Go to Boroughmuir? Guy of Namur had arrived with his retinue at Berwick, too late to join the king in his invasion. Namur's motives were firmly in the tradition of chivalry; to take part in a military adventure and to thereby enhance the chivalric reputation of himself and of the company of 100 or so men-at-arms who accompanied him. He was a Fleming, and beyond his kinship to Queen Philippa, should have had little interest in Edward's Scottish war. It is reasonably safe to assume that he was simply looking for adventure; for his desire for action led him to take a step that more prudent council should have advised against. With a small force of some 300 knights, men-at-arms and archers he entered Scotland, hoping to meet up with the king in the centre of the country. His movements are likely to have been observed virtually from the outset; for he was ambushed as he approached Edinburgh by the earl of Moray. Namur managed to fight his way through to the Borough Muir, where on 30 July he found himself in the midst of a full-scale battle. His men gave a good account of themselves; but when Sir William Douglas arrived from the nearby Pentland Hills to reinforce Moray, they were in immediate danger of being overwhelmed. A Wall of Horse Flesh With no other option Namur and his men made for Edinburgh, a little to the north of their present position. Closely pursued by the enemy they entered the city by way of the Friars' Wynd, and the fighting continued through the St. Mary Wynd all the way up to the castle, which had lain in ruins since 1314. The gaps in the defenses were filled in the only way possible; the horses were killed to provide a barricade of flesh. Moray and his men were held for the time being, but the position was hopeless. Walter Bower, the chronicler, describes their predicament and the outcome; The men of Namur therefore, as they fled and fought bravely, kept together until they climbed the lamentable hill where there used to be the Maidens' castle of Edinburgh, which had been demolished earlier for fear of the English. These rocks they defended courageously, and killing their exhausted and injured horses besides, they made a defensive wall with their bodies. And thus, surrounded and besieged by the Scots throughout the whole of that night, they passed it continuously without sleep, hungry, cold, thirsty and weary. Tired out and distressed in this way, and with no hope of any help, they in the morning of the next day surrendered themselves to the Scots in capitulation, after an agreement had been reached about the ransom to be paid, provided that they could depart to their home country. Defeat in Victory Moray behaved with generosity, allowing them to depart on swearing never again to take arms against the supporters of King David. There was, besides any chivalric considerations, a political dimension to his actions. Namur was the subject of Philip VI, king of France, and the Guardian had no wish to upset Scotland's most vital ally. He even decided to escort Namur in person back towards the border. It cost him dearly. On his way back he was ambushed by an English force from Jedburgh under William Pressen. Sir William Douglas managed to escape, but his brother, James, was killed. Moray himself was taken prisoner, destined to spend the next five years in English jails. Namur returned to Berwick and sailed with Queen Philippa to join Edward at Perth. He was well received by the king, although his recent discomfiture must have been the occasion for some political embarrassment. Because of his pact with Moray the count was of no military value to Edward, and he soon left Scotland, never to return. With his reputation compromised the unfortunate Namur was severely censured by the English chroniclers for daring to enter enemy territory with so modest a following.

Adam in particular is a central figure in Mormon cosmology. Robert L. Millet, an LDS author, wrote of the church's perspective: > Few persons in all eternity have been more directly involved in the plan of > salvation‚Äîthe creation, the fall, and the ultimate redemption of the > children of God‚Äîthan the man Adam. His ministry among the sons and daughters > of earth stretches from the distant past of premortality to the distant > future of resurrection, judgment, and beyond.. Identity of Adam and Eve According to LDS Church teachings, all people born on the earth lived with God the Father and Jesus Christ in a pre-mortal life. Adam and Eve were \\"among our Father's noblest children\\" and they were \\"foreordained\\" to be the parents of the human race. In the pre-mortal life, Adam was the archangel Michael. As Michael, Adam \\"led the forces of God against the armies of Lucifer\\" in the War in Heaven. LDS Church scripture provides no information about Eve prior to her earth life, but it is believed that \\"she must have been a choice daughter of God\\". In the LDS Church's temple endowment, it is taught that Adam is Michael and that he assisted Jehovah in the creation. In the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve's bodies were created by God the Father and Jesus Christ and were placed in the Garden of Eden, which Joseph Smith taught was located in or near Jackson County, Missouri.Andrew Jenson (1888). Historical Record of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 7:438‚Äì439 (1888).Orson F. Whitney (1967). Life of Heber C. Kimball (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 219.Heber C. Kimball, \\"Advancement of the Saints\\", Journal of Discourses 10:235 (1863).Journal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young to Orson Hyde, March 15, 1857. When they were created, their bodies were not mortal and they could not die or have children, and they did not know right from wrong. Adam and Eve were married by God in Eden,Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts, ed.), History of the Church 2:320. and he commanded them to have children: \\"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over ‚Ä¶ every living thing that moveth upon the earth\\".Pearl of Great Price, God told them they could eat of any tree in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and that the day they ate the fruit from that tree they would die.Pearl of Great Price, Adam was made ‚Äúlord or governor of all things on earth, and at the same time [enjoyed] communion ‚Ä¶ with his Maker, without a veil to separate between.‚Äù Fall Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat of the prohibited fruit.Pearl of Great Price, Eve yielded to temptation and ate of the fruit; when Adam learned that Eve had done so, he ate the fruit too.Pearl of Great Price, Because they ate of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve underwent the \\"fall\\". As God had promised, the bodies of Adam and Eve became mortal and they became subject to physical death, as well as sickness and pain. Erastus Snow taught that the fruits of the Earth literally made Adam and Eve's bodies mortal. They also underwent \\"spiritual death\\": they were separated from the presence of God by being cast out of the Garden of Eden. Due to the fall, Adam and Eve also came to know the difference between good and evil and became capable of having children, as God had originally commanded. =Positive interpretation of the fall= Unlike some Christians, Latter-day Saints generally do not see the fall of Adam and Eve as a serious sin or as an overwhelmingly negative event. Rather, the fall is viewed as \\"a necessary step in the plan of life and a great blessing to all of us. Because of the Fall, we are blessed with physical bodies, the right to choose between good and evil, and the opportunity to gain eternal life. None of these privileges would have been ours had Adam and Eve remained in the garden.\\" Latter-day Saint scripture reports that Adam and Eve later rejoiced that they had chosen to partake of the fruit,Pearl of Great Price, and the Book of Mormon teaches that the fall was necessary for humankind to exist and for them to develop and eventually experience joy, which is the ultimate purpose of existence: \\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\\" Furthermore, the LDS version of the fall of Adam and Eve emphasizes the fall was a part of God's plan: \\"But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things,\\" as God had \\"foreordained\\" and prepared Jesus Christ to be slain \\"from the foundation of the world\\" in order to redeem mankind from the fall. In the early church, the idea that Eve's promised hardshipsGenesis were passed on to all women was commonly accepted. Valerie Cassler argues that God's description of her future hardships was not a curse, but a natural consequence that comes from living in a world with opposites. The fall of Adam and Eve as viewed by Latter-day Saints denies the concept of original sin. They instead believe that \\"little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in [Jesus Christ].\\"Moroni 8:8. Joseph Smith also stated that \\"men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam‚Äôs transgression.\\"Pearl of Great Price, Articles of Faith 1:2 Latter-day Saint doctrine holds firm that through repentance, Adam and Eve were eventually forgiven of their transgression in Eden.Pearl of Great Price, . Post-fall lives Latter-day Saint scripture teaches that Adam and Eve had \\"sons and daughters\\" after the fall,Pearl of Great Price, including Cain, Abel,Pearl of Great Price, and Seth.Pearl of Great Price, Adam and Eve worshiped God, offered animal sacrifices, and were taught by an angel about Jesus Christ.Pearl of Great Price, Latter-day Saint doctrine teaches that the \\"coats of skins\\" Adam and Eve receivedGenesis 3:21 were to remind them of the coming of Jesus Christ who, through the atonement, would \\"cover their sins\\".Arthur A. Bailey, \\"What Modern Revelation Teaches about Adam\\", Ensign, January 1998. Adam is believed to be \\"the world's first Christian,\\" as well as the first prophet. Adam was taught the plan of salvation, was baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ, received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and was given the Melchizedek priesthood.Pearl of Great Price, Adam ordained his descendants to the priesthood, including Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah. Three years prior to his death, Adam and his righteous posterity gathered in the valley of Adam- ondi-Ahman in present-day Daviess County, Missouri, where Adam and Eve had settled after being expelled from the Garden of Eden.John Taylor (1882). The Mediation and Atonement (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News) p. 69.Matthias F. Cowley (1964). Wilford Woodruff (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) pp. 481, 545‚Äì546. At this meeting, Adam bestowed his last blessing on his descendants. Jesus Christ appeared at the meeting to bless Adam and Adam uttered prophecies, which are said to have been recorded by Enoch. Adam died when he was 930 years old.Pearl of Great Price, Visions and prophecies about Adam and Eve Some presidents of the LDS Church report to have had visions of Adam and Eve. In 1836, Joseph Smith said that he saw Adam in the celestial kingdom and in 1918 Joseph F. Smith said that he saw Adam and Eve in the world of spirits when Jesus visited there between his death and resurrection. Joseph Smith also said that the voice of Adam was heard near the Susquehanna River \\"detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light\\". Joseph Smith prophesied that Adam would one day return to Adam-ondi-Ahman \\"to visit his people\\". Thousands will attend this meeting with Adam, which will be prior to and in preparation of the Second Coming of Jesus. Adam is believed to be the \\"Ancient of Days\\" prophesied of in the Book of Daniel. At the Second Coming, Adam will \\"sound his trump\\", which will signal the resurrection of the dead. At the end of the millennial rule of Christ, Adam will lead the forces of good against Satan in the final \\"battle of the great God\\", also known as the battle of Gog and Magog.Joseph Smith (Joseph Fielding Smith ed.) (1976). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 280. One LDS Church apostle has suggested that it may have been Adam who was sent as the angel Michael to \\"strengthen\\"See Jesus when he was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane during his passion. Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine Several early leaders of the LDS Church taught that Adam was God because he was the father of the human race. This doctrine was taught several times by Brigham Young during general conferences..Journal of Discourses 5:327. and was supported by other high- ranking leaders of the church.Heber C. Kimball, Journal of Discourses 4:1Franklin D. Richards, reported in \\"Minutes of the Special General Council\\", Millennial Star 16:534, 26 August 1854.Journal of Wilford Woodruff, April 10, 1852. However, the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine never gained wide support by the church as a whole. Some members and critics of the church claimed that Young was declaring Adam to be God the Father. This specific interpretation was later repudiated by church president Spencer W. Kimball.

He was a specialist in Early Netherlandish painting and the Northern Renaissance, who volunteered at the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin in 1891 under Friedrich Lippmann. On Lippmann's recommendation, Wilhelm von Bode took him on as his assistant in 1896 for the paintings division. He was appointed deputy director under Bode in 1904 and became director himself from 1924 to 1932, working on his history From Van Eyck to Bruegel and the 14-volume (printed in 16, with supplements) survey Early Netherlandish Painting. In 1933 he was dismissed as a \\"non-Aryan\\" and in 1939 had to move to Amsterdam as a result of being a Jew. He attained the rank and title of geheimrat (privy councillor) under the German Empire.He also donated several works to the collection and worked in the art trade as an advisor, to Hermann G√∂ring among others. Friedl√§nder's approach to art history was essentially that of a connoisseur. He gave priority to a critical reading based on sensitivity rather than on grand artistic and or aesthetic theories. He described it as follows: > If the determination of the authorship of an individual work of art most > certainly is not the ultimate and highest task of artistic erudition; even > if it were no path to the goal: nevertheless, without a doubt, it is a > school for the eye, since there is no formulation of a question which forces > us to penetrate so deeply the essence of an individual work as that > concerning the identity of the author.

His personal archive with approximately 15,000 photos and reproductions of 15th- and 16th-century paintings from the North and South Netherlands are often accompanied with notes including such things as the provenance, attribution, relative condition, and location of the paintings.

It is in the town of Kent, New York, and is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of New York City. It is the northernmost reservoir in the Croton River watershed, but is not part of the New York City water supply system's Croton Watershed. and was formed by impounding the middle of the West Branch of the Croton River, submerging the village of Boyds Corner. History Completed in 1872, the Boyds Corner Dam saw the use of concrete in dam construction for the first time since the Ancient Romans. It was put into service in 1873, 78 feet high, making the Boyds Corner Reservoir the City's second oldest, after the New Croton Reservoir. Originally constructed as part of the City's Croton Watershed system, Boyds Corner today serves mainly as part of the Catskill/Delaware water supply system. The Boyds Corner watershed drainage basin is long and a mere 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide, and includes the headwaters of the West Branch of the Croton River. It spans portions of the Towns of Carmel and Putnam Valley in Putnam County, and East Fishkill in Dutchess County. The reservoir can hold . This makes it one of the smaller in New York City's water supply system. Water from Boyds Corner flows briefly into the West Branch of the Croton River, then continues southeast to enter the West Branch Reservoir, where it mixes with water carried from the Rondout Reservoir west of the Hudson River by the Delaware Aqueduct. Water from the West Branch Reservoir then continues via the aqueduct on to the Kensico Reservoir, which also receives a supply from the Catskill system through the Catskill Aqueduct. After settling at Kensico, the water flows through two aqueducts to the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, where it enters the City's distribution system. Any water in excess of New York City's needs at the West Branch Reservoir is diverted over a spillway back into the West Branch of the Croton River, whence it becomes part of the City's Croton Watershed. It is then mixed with water from the Middle Branch of the Croton River at the Croton Falls Reservoir. Flow then briefly returns to the West Branch of the Croton River before reaching a confluence with the Croton River proper. This continues southwest to the New Croton Reservoir. Any water in excess of the City's needs there then goes over the New Croton Dam back into the Croton River, where it carried until discharging into the Hudson River at Croton-on-Hudson, New York. After the Teton Dam failure on the Snake River in Idaho, it was ordered that all dams in the United States be inspected for weaknesses and deterioration. In the 1980s it was discovered that the hundred-plus year-old Boyds Corner Dam was needed to be replaced. In spite of opposition by those who believed the dam was in good condition, it was dismantled and the basin stood empty until the new dam was completed in 1990 and the reservoir refilled to capacity . The reconstruction included the addition of a new spillway with a 6.1m wide flip bucket in the central dam section and the use of post-tensioned anchors to increase dam stability.

It is sometimes called Holevo's bound, since it establishes an upper bound to the amount of information that can be known about a quantum state (accessible information). It was published by Alexander Holevo in 1973. Accessible information As for several concepts in quantum information theory, accessible information is best understood in terms of a 2-party communication. So we introduce two parties, Alice and Bob. Alice has a classical random variable X, which can take the values {1, 2, ..., n} with corresponding probabilities {p1, p2, ..., pn}. Alice then prepares a quantum state, represented by the density matrix œÅX chosen from a set {œÅ1, œÅ2, ... œÅn}, and gives this state to Bob. Bob's goal is to find the value of X, and in order to do that, he performs a measurement on the state œÅX, obtaining a classical outcome, which we denote with Y. In this context, the amount of accessible information, that is, the amount of information that Bob can get about the variable X, is the maximum value of the mutual information I(X : Y) between the random variables X and Y over all the possible measurements that Bob can do. There is currently no known formula to compute the accessible information. There are however several upper bounds, the best-known of which is the Holevo bound, which is specified in the following theorem. Statement of the theorem Let {œÅ1, œÅ2, ..., œÅn} be a set of mixed states and let œÅX be one of these states drawn according to the probability distribution P = {p1, p2, ..., pn}. Then, for any measurement described by POVM elements {EY} and performed on \\\\rho= \\\\sum_X p_X \\\\rho_X, the amount of accessible information about the variable X knowing the outcome Y of the measurement is bounded from above as follows: :I(X:Y) \\\\leq S(\\\\rho) - \\\\sum_i p_i S(\\\\rho_i) where \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\rho_i and S(\\\\cdot) is the von Neumann entropy. The quantity on the right hand side of this inequality is called the Holevo information or Holevo œá quantity: :\\\\chi := S(\\\\rho) - \\\\sum_i p_i S(\\\\rho_i) . Proof The proof can be given using three quantum systems, called P, Q, M. P can be intuitively thought as the preparation, Q can be thought as the quantum state prepared by Alice and given to Bob, and M can be thought as Bob's measurement apparatus. The compound system P \\\\otimes Q \\\\otimes M at the beginning is in the state :\\\\rho^{PQM} := \\\\sum_x p_x x\\\\rangle \\\\langle x \\\\otimes \\\\rho_x \\\\otimes 0\\\\rangle \\\\langle0 Alice's state P can be thought of as Alice having the value x for the random variable X. Then the preparation state is the mixed state described by the density matrix \\\\sum_x p_x x\\\\rangle \\\\langle x, and the quantum state given to Bob is \\\\sum_x p_x \\\\rho_x, and Bob's measurement apparatus is in its initial or rest state 0\\\\rangle . Using known results of quantum information theory it can be shown that : S(P';M') \\\\leq S(P;Q) which, after some algebraic manipulation, can be shown to be equivalent to the statement of the theorem. Comments and remarks In essence, the Holevo bound proves that given n qubits, although they can \\"carry\\" a larger amount of (classical) information (thanks to quantum superposition), the amount of classical information that can be retrieved, i.e. accessed, can be only up to n classical (non-quantum encoded) bits. This is surprising, for two reasons: (1) quantum computing is so often more powerful than classical computing, that results which show it to be only as good or inferior to conventional techniques are unusual, and (2) because it takes 2^n complex numbers to encode the qubits that represent a mere n bits.

It lived on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues, but it is nowadays extinct. It is part of the genus of Mascarene owls, Mascarenotus, although more recent studies have recommended reclassifying it and its relatives under the genus Otus. Like many of the Mascarene land-birds, the genus was a distinct relative to South-East Asian taxa, in this case apparently being a descendant of the direct ancestor of the Oriental scops owl. Taxonomy Leg bones It is sometimes assumed that Leguat mentioned this bird in his 1708 memoir, but this seems to be in error; Julien Tafforet gave a good description in 1726, however. The Rodrigues bird, which Tafforet compared to the petit-duc, the Eurasian scops owl (and not, as often assumed to the little owl, the chouette chev√™che), was more arboreal than its congeners and fed on small birds and \\"lizards\\" (small specimens of the Rodrigues day gecko and the Rodrigues giant day gecko). A monotonous call was given in good weather. Considering the bird's likely relationships as evidenced by the subfossil bones discovered later, and the detailed description of the related Mauritius owl, the Rodriguez bird was as large as a good-sized Australian boobook, with females reaching the size of a long-eared owl, and had ear tufts like an Otus owl and nearly naked legs. In the original description, Milne- Edwards referred the bones to a Strix owl, mistakenly assuming that Tafforet had described a species of the tuftless owl genera. One larger tibiotarsus was assigned by him to the same sort of bird, but not described further. G√ºnther & E. Newton, in their discussion of additional bones, quite logically assigned this bone to a female of this species, given that the small size of the island seems to preclude two competing similar species of owl to coexist. Rothschild, however, described the larger bone as type of what he assumed was a miniature eagle owl, Bubo leguati. It is nowadays accepted that the assignment to sex by G√ºnther & Newton was correct. In 2018, a DNA study by Louchart and colleagues found that the Mascarenotus owls grouped among species of Otus (the scops owls), and therefore belonged to that genus. The cladogram below shows the placement of the Rodrigues owl: Description Tafforet's description of the bird reads as follows: Extinction Regardless of whether Leguat mentioned owls, Tafforet's record is the last reference to this bird. It probably was unable to cope with the ecological alterations and the predation which resulted from the human settlement and the large rat population. The bird became apparently extinct in the mid-18th century; as Rodrigues is quite a small island, it is likely that Pingr√© would have recorded them in 1761 if they had still been present.

It has been told in many variants. Andrew Lang included one in The Lilac Fairy Book. The ointment itself, as a substance allowing a human to see fairies, occasionally appears in fantasy literature. Folk-tales about such an ointment are found in Scandinavia, France and the British Isles Synopsis A midwife is summoned to attend a childbed. The baby is born, and she is given an ointment to rub in its eyes. Accidentally, or through curiosity, she rubs one or both her own eyes with it. This enables her to see the actual house to which she has been summoned. Sometimes a simple cottage becomes a castle, but most often, a grand castle becomes a wretched cave. In the variant Andrew Lang included, the woman saw a neighbor of hers, kept prisoner as a nurse, and was able to tell her husband how to rescue her, pulling her down from riding fairies as in Tam Lin. Soon, the midwife sees a fairy and admits it. The fairy invariably blinds her in the eye that can see him, or both if she put the ointment in both eyes. In a Cornish tale a woman, Joan, is going to market to buy shoes, and calls on a neighbour, Betty, who has a reputation for witchcraft, to see if she will go along. Joan sees Betty rub an ointment into her children's eyes. When Betty is out of the room she rubs some of the ointment into right eye out of curiosity. Betty returns with a glass of brandy, and when Joan drinks the brandy she is amazed to see that the cottage is full of little people dancing and playing games. Betty says she won't go to market, so Joan goes alone. At the market, Joan sees Betty's husband, Thomas Trenance, taking \\"whatever took his fancy\\" from the market stalls and putting it into a bag, apparently unnoticed by the stall holders. She challenges him as a thief. He asks which eye she sees him with, and when she points to her right eye he touches it with his finger and she is instantly blinded.Alexander, Marc; A Companion to the Folklore, Myths and Customs of Britain, 2002 Other uses Fairy ointment also appears in many other fairy tales and books of fantasy, usually as a method for seeing through a fairy's magic. For example, in Eloise McGraw's The Moorchild, the protagonists enter a fairy hill in search of a stolen child, but are confused and hypnotized by the fairies' glamour until they smear their eyes with stolen fairy ointment.

Heaps (1880-1962) was an English architect responsible for the design of a number of stations on the London Underground system as well as the design of train depots and bus and trolleybus garages for London Transport. Works Kilburn Park Underground station Edgware Underground station Osterley Underground station In 1903 Heaps became assistant to Leslie Green the architect for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and aided him in the design of the station buildings for the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway (now part of the Bakerloo line), the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;, now part of the Northern line) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (part of the Piccadilly line); all distinctive with their striking red glazed terra cotta fa√ßades and semi- circular windows at first floor. Following the early death of Green in 1908, Heaps became the UERL's architect and produced designs for a number of new stations on the Bakerloo and Northern lines during the 1910s and early 1920s. Heaps' first independent station designs were for the four new stations on the Bakerloo line extension from Edgware Road tube station opened in 1913 and 1915. Although not the first London Underground stations to be provided with escalators; Paddington, Warwick Avenue, Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were the first stations to be designed specifically for their use rather than use lifts as had the original Bakerloo line stations opened less than ten years earlier. The station buildings designed for Maida Vale and Kilburn Park (Warwick Avenue is accessed by a subway and has no surface building and Paddington had only a small subway entrance) were based on the earlier Leslie Green design, using the same terra cotta tiling. Green's stations had been two-storey structures; the lift plant housed in part of the first floor level behind the characteristic semi-circular arched windows. By using escalators, Heaps' stations did not require a second floor to accommodate plant and they were designed as more modest single-storey buildings featuring tall windows each with a broad, tiled transom separating the curved top section to reflect Green's design. In 1915 Heaps also designed a new frontage for the Central line's station at Wood Lane (closed in 1947 and now demolished). This featured mosaic tiled Underground roundels over the entrances similar to those installed at Maida Vale station. After World War I, Heaps designed the stations for the 1923-4 extension of the CCE&HR; from Golders Green to Edgware. Unlike the Bakerloo line stations which had been built in well- developed central London, the five new stations for the CCE&HR; were constructed in open countryside and the buildings were given a suburban style more in keeping with the new housing developments that were expected to grow around them. The buildings were built of brick with tiled pitched roofs. Four of the stations (Brent, Colindale, Hendon Central and Edgware) were given stone colonnaded frontages somewhat reminiscent of cricket pavilions. The fifth station, Burnt Oak (Watling), opened with a temporary building that was replaced in 1925 by a permanent building that was built without a colonnade. Hendon Central station was quickly surrounded by and incorporated into a larger block of shops and apartments so that the simple elegant building can no longer be easily discerned. Colindale station was destroyed by a bomb in 1940 but was not fully replaced, in a new design, until 1962. After the Edgware extension stations, Frank Pick the UERL's Assistant Managing Director, wanted a more modern style for the set of new stations on the extension of the City and South London Railway to Morden. Pick commissioned the designs of these from Charles Holden, who provided the designs for the majority of new Underground stations built in the 1930s. Heaps concentrated on the design of less noteworthy but nonetheless important depot buildings for trains and buses although he designed new stations at Osterley, Boston Manor and St. John's Wood. Heaps remained Chief Architect for the UERL and its successor London Transport into the 1940s. He worked throughout that period with the Underground's consultant architect, Charles Holden, on a number of stations including Hounslow West and Ealing Common. During the Second War World Heaps served as Director of Construction at the Ministry of Aircraft Production.

He was the first husband of the celebrated novelist Eileen Chang. Early life Hu Lancheng (February 28, 1906 ‚Äì July 25, 1981), also known as Zhang Jiayi Âº†Âòâ‰ª™, was born in Zhejiang, China. Hu had six brothers, and he was the sixth child of Hu Xiumin (ËÉ°ÁßÄÈì≠) and Wu Juhua (Âê¥ËèäËä±).Zhang, G. Âº†Ê°ÇÂçé. (2010). Hu lancheng zhuan ËÉ°ÂÖ∞Êàê‰º†.

In 1918, when Hu was twelve years old, he attended the entrance examination of Zhishan elementary school, in the summer of the same year, Hu enrolled in Secondary School Affiliated to Shaoxing No.5 Normal School.Zhang 2010, p. 16. In 1919, Hu got into Shaoxing No.5 Secondary School. Hu only studied one semester, school closed in second semester due to boycott of classes.Zhang 2010, p. 17. In 1920, Hu went to Hangzhou with his cousin Wu xuefan (Âê¥Èõ™Â∏Ü), they both enrolled in Hangzhou Huilan Secondary School. He met many people during this time and made friends with Wang Jingzhi (Ê±™Èùô‰πã), Liu Zhaoyang (ÂàòÊúùÈò≥), and Cui Zhenwu (Â¥îÁúüÂêæ).Zhang 2010, p. 19-21. In 1923, Hu was eighteen years old and started his third year in Huilan Secondary School, he engaged with Tang Yufeng (ÂîêÁéâÂá§). When Hu was one semester short of earning his degree in Huilan Secondary School, Hu was expelled from school because he offended the registrar by editing the school newsletter.Zhang 2010, p. 24. Two years later, in September 1925, Hu's father was found dead in his house and it was only one month after this event that Hu married Tang Yufeng, his first wife of five.Zhang 2010, p. 26. Education Hu grew up in the countryside where most people were uneducated, and although Hu was quite smart and good at learning, his original family was too poor to afford his education. Fortunately, he was well supported by his adoptive parents (‰πâÁà∂) and finished his elementary education in Shaoxing.Zhang, G. (2010). Hu Lancheng Zhuan. Changchun: Beifang funv ertong chubanshe. In 1921, Hu entered the Wayland High School (ËïôÂÖ∞‰∏≠Â≠¶), a Christian School in Hangzhou. The school was famous for its English education, and many big-name writers such as Yu Dafu (ÈÉÅËææÂ§´) and Lu Li (ÈôÜË†°) had also studied there. Throughout four-year study in the Wayland School, Hu refused to go to church and spent most of the time in reading.Qin, X. (2010). Lie and Truth - Biography of Hu Lancheng. New Literature History, 24(135), pp.28-41. Apart from study, Hu took an active part in developing social connections with many alumni, which later played an important role in his life. Unlike Hu's poor hometown, Hangzhou was a city with enormous opportunities and new ideas that attracted many young people like Hu. During his stay in Hangzhou, Hu was connected with the Hupan Poets Club (ÊπñÁïîËØóÁ§æ), which has made an important impact in the Chinese New Culture Movement and the history of modern Chinese poetry.Zhang, G. (2010). Hu Lancheng Zhuan. Changchun: Beifang funv ertong chubanshe. By having access to education in Hangzhou, Hu was provided opportunities to develop his talent in literature, and therefore marked a turning point in his life.

For fans of Eileen Chang, also known colloquially as Zhangmi (ÂºµËø∑), Hu Lancheng's trysts are nothing short of notorious.Wang 2015, p. 155. Eileen Chang was his fourth wife out of five, a relationship that began through an affair while Hu was still married to his third wife.Wang 2015, p. 155-156. It is said that their attraction to one another was sparked through their impressive literary talent and Hu often spoke of Chang in high praise.Wang 2015, p. 155-156. Their marriage, similar to his past relationships, was riddled with affairs from beginning to end (1944‚Äì1946).Wang 2015, p. 155-156. His amorous affairs were only made worse by the fact he was largely financially dependent on Eileen Chang.Wang 2015, p. 155. According to his own memoir, Hu seduced a nurse named Zhou Xunde, who was just seventeen, shortly after marrying Chang.Wang 2015, p. 181. Moreover, near the end of their marriage, his affair with the widow Fan Xiumei, a member of the host family with whom he was staying, even lead to a pregnancy.Wang 2015, p. 181. Following his escape to Japan after World War II, Hu Lancheng married the widow of a Shanghai political collaborator, She Aizhen, but not before characteristically having a three-year affair with the wife of his then- landlord.Wang 2015, p. 181.  Career  =In China= Hu Lancheng began his career by working as a clerk in the University of Yen-ching, located in Beijing, which eventually exposed him to the western intellectual thought that inspired much of his writing and political beliefs, Marxism being one example.Wang 2015, p. 159. This was followed by a period of teaching positions at various high schools, this lasted about five years approximately. Hu Lancheng's acclaimed literary career began in Guangxi province in 1932 with the publishing of various essays in local in journals and newspapers.Wang 2015, p. 159. Under the employment of Wang Ching-wei in the late 1930s, Hu's essays functioned as propaganda for the movement, most of which were featured in an organization devoted to the supporting Wang's ideals, such as the South China Daily.Wang 2015, p. 160.

Although involved with the GMD, Hu Lancheng's political stance was largely inspired by the concept of xing, a term which can be simply explained as the fabrication of some force that stirs and encourages others.Carlos Rojas and Andrea Bachner. ‚ÄúThe Oxford Handbook of Modern Chinese Literatures‚Äù (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016) 605-607 When applied to the makings of history, xing could be understood as the catalyst of revolution, and the belief that modern China was in desperate need of this was the foundation to Hu Lancheng's political stance.Rojas and Bachner 2016, p. 606 It was these values that could lead to Hu's controversial political values, including this quotation on his thoughts on human life in the making of a revolution, ‚ÄúEven if‚Ä¶ [they] have killed millions of people, I won‚Äôt blink my eyes for a moment‚Ä¶ it is the Way of heaven to kill the innocent.‚ÄùRojas and Bachner 2016, p. 607 ‚ÄúRevolution ... is the completion of humanity; it is its own end... We are fighting a war but we are not fighting for any goal. If one imposed a goal on it, the war would become something to put up with, rather than something to cheer for. I was dismayed when I first heard that one can willingly engage in a war that has no goal, but careful thinking has led me to realize the magnitude of its meaning‚Äù ‚Äì Hu Lancheng Wang 2015, p.158 Hu Lancheng did not begin as an ally to the Wang Ching-wei regime, in fact, in 1943 he was sent to jail in Nanjing for publicly critiquing the puppet regime in his writings.Wang 2015, p.158 Hu eventually agreed with Wang Ching-Wei and supported his campaign, it is as he says in his own words ‚ÄúIt was a clear and peaceful day. All the mixed thoughts in my mind disappeared and I came to a crystal-clear attitude toward the vicissitudes of the world‚Ä¶ I agreed to join the [Wang‚Äôs] campaign‚Äù.Wang 2015, p.184 It is important to note that his time in the Wang regime was not marked without scandal, however, as he was caught publicly critiquing the collaborationist government and was once again jailed. It was at this point and time in his life that Hu began to strongly align himself with the Japanese for protection.Wang 2015, 160 List of major works Works written in Chinese: *Êà∞Èõ£Âíå‰∫¶‰∏çÊòì Zhannan he yi buyi (To Seek Battle Is Difficult; to Seek Peace Is No Less Easy, 1938), Taipei: Yuanjing chubanshe, 2001. *Â±±Ê≤≥Ê≠≤Êúà Shanhe suiyue (China through Time, 1954), Taipei: Yuanjing chubanshe, 2003. *‰ªäÁîü‰ªä‰∏ñ Jinsheng jinshi (This Life, This World, 1959), Taipei: Yuanjing chubanshe, 2004. *‰∏ñÁïå‰πãËΩâÊ©üÂú®‰∏≠Âúã Shijie zhi zhuanji zai zhongguo (1962), Hong Kong: Xinwen tiandi she, 1963. *ËèØÂ≠∏ÁßëÂ≠∏ËàáÂì≤Â≠∏ Huaxue kexue yu zhexue (1975), Beijing: Zhongguo changan chubanshe, 2013. *Á¶™ÊòØ‰∏ÄÊûùËä± Chan shi yizhihua (Zen Buddhism is a Flower, 1976), Beijing: Zhongguo changan chubanshe, 2013. *‰∏≠ÂúãÁöÑÁ¶ÆÊ®ÇÈ¢®ÊôØ Zhongguo de liyue fengjing (1979), Taipei: Yuanliu chuban shiye gufen youxian gongsi, 1991. *‰ªäÊó•‰ΩïÊó•ÂÖÆ Jinri heri xi (1980), Taipei: Yuanliu chuban shiye gufen youxian gongsi, 1990. *‰∏≠ÂúãÊñáÂ≠∏Âè≤Ë©± Zhongguo wenxue shihua (History of Chinese Literature, 1980), Beijing: Zhongguo changan chubanshe, 2013. *ÈñíÊÑÅËê¨Á®Æ Xianchou wanzhong (A Thousand Kinds of Needless Misery, 1981), Taipei: Yuanliu chuban shiye gufen youxian gongsi, 1991.

Literary analysis Wang Xiangfu mentions that Hu Lancheng is skilled in his writings and is unique, however, his literature remains to be his only achievement in his whole life.Wang, Xiangfu ÁéãÁ••Â§´. \\"ÊàëÁúãËÉ°ÂÖ∞Êàê.\\" [I look at Hu Lancheng]. Ming zuo xin shang: jian shang ban (shang xun) Âêç‰ΩúÊ¨£ËµèÔºöÈâ¥ËµèÁâàÔºà‰∏äÊó¨Ôºâ[Masterpiece], no. 1, 2010, pp. 40-43. Hu Lancheng has a hobby of writing literature. Two of his most well- known literary works, Shanhe suiyue (China Through Time, 1954) and Jinsheng jinshi are of high artistic value. His memoir, Jinsheng jinshi (This Life, This World) paints a picture of his own life and he narrates it through a very natural way. Hu Lancheng approaches a fragmented style of writing, which is quite suitable for writing short fictional novels as it can jump from one point to another very quickly and frequently. Some people say that Hu Lancheng gained fame through the fans of Eileen Chang. Some even admitted that it was because they loved Chang's literary works that they also appreciated Hu's writings.Wang, Xiangfu. 2010, p. 41. It was the act of loving one individual and extending that love towards their family (ai wu ji wu Áà±Â±ãÂèä‰πå). Hu Lancheng's writing could be hard to grasp at times and makes readers ponder for a better understanding. He also includes many surprises such as beginning his memoir in a unique way, and as a result throwing many people off, as they would never have guessed that to be the start of the book. As Wang Xiangfu describes, Hu Lancheng is a romantic, fengliu È£éÊµÅ, person and without doubt he is a talented scholar.Wang, Xiangfu. 2010, p. 42. Death and legacy On July 25, 1981, Hu Lancheng passed away at age 75 due to chronic heart failure in Tokyo, Japan. As for his legacy, Hu Lancheng ‚Äúplayed a double role in the legend of Eileen Chang‚Äù as he was praised for his literary contributions but angered Chang's fans with his irresponsibility and betrayal.Wang 2015, p. 155. Hu was one of the ‚Äúfirst few critics to appreciate‚Äù the talent of Eileen Chang's and praise her literary works.Wang 2015, p. 156. There was a mutual bond between Hu and Chang because ‚Äúthey mutually illuminated each other‚Äôs literary and intellectual paths‚Äù. Hu Lancheng ‚Äúwas a strong writer in his own right; as critics have observed, his style is so exquisite that it exerts an enchanting power over readers even to date,‚Äù.Wang 2015, p. 156. His life as a whole, on the other hand, has been succinctly summarized as such: ‚ÄúCaikexi, renyingfei ÊâçÂèØÊÉúÔºå‰∫∫Â∫îÂ∫ü‚Äù (His talent should be cherished, he himself should be punished).Liu, Yu ÂàòÈõ®. (2017). ÊâçÂèØÊÉúÔºå‰∫∫Â∫îÂ∫ü‚Äî‚ÄîËØªËÉ°ÂÖ∞Êàê„Ää‰ªäÁîü‰ªä‰∏ñ„ÄãÊúâÊÑü. [His talent should be cherished, he himself should be punished - Impressed by Hu Lancheng's This Life, These Times]. ÊñáÊïôËµÑÊñô [Data of Culture and Education], vol. 8, pg. 16. Although Hu Lancheng is known to be a Hanjian, a traitor, in the Chinese culture, he ‚Äúnever conceded to any charge of treason or infidelity against him. Instead, he eloquently defended his deeds in terms of intellectual necessity as well as effective imperative‚Ä¶Hu Lancheng still remains an infamous name in China.‚Äù.Wang 2015, p. 157.

It is about the historic slave revolt led by Spartacus around 71 BC. The book inspired the 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick and the 2004 TV adaptation by Robert Dornhelm. Plot summary Spartacus begins with three young Roman patricians ‚Äì Caius, his sister Helena and her friend Claudia, commencing a journey from Rome to Capua along the Via Appia a few weeks after the final suppression of the slave revolt. The road is lined by \\"tokens of punishment\\" ‚Äì slaves crucified in the immediate aftermath of the revolt. During the first day of their travel the party encounter several representative individuals; a minor politician, a prosperous businessman of the equestrian class, an eastern trader and a young officer of the legions; all of whom give their respective perspectives on the rising. On arrival at a palatial country villa where they are to spend the night, the trio meet with other guests, both historical and fictional, who either played key roles in the events just finished or who have sufficient perception to analyze the significance of slavery as an institution within the Roman Republic. From the encounters at the Villa Salaria, the focus of the novel moves to occasions before and during the actual rising of the slaves. The emphasis is on Spartacus, his life in the mines and as a gladiator; his character, powers of leadership and dreams of a just society where exploitation and cruelty have been eliminated. Spartacus had been born a free man in his homeland of Thrace, but he was captured as a young man and sold as a slave in the gold-mines of Libya. Eventually, he and several Thracian slaves, including his comrade Gannicus, are bought by a wealthy nobleman, Lentulus Batiatus, who owns and trains a large number of gladiators at his estate near the Italian city of Capua. There, Spartacus and Gannicus meet a large number of Africans, Gauls, and Thracians who train and fight as gladiators for the roaring applause of Roman crowds. There, Spartacus and Gannicus meet and befriend three fellow gladiators, a large red-headed Gaul named Crixus, a Jew named David, and a dark-skinned African named Nordo. Spartacus trains and fights as a gladiator, while adjusting well to the comforts of the ludus that Batiatus and his trainers provide for them. He eventually meets and begins a romantic relationship with a golden-haired German girl named Varinia, who is one of several dozen female slaves that Batiatus keeps for the pleasure of his gladiators. But Spartacus and many of his fellow gladiators yearn for freedom, and after being harassed by the prison guards one day, the gladiators and female slaves rise up in revolt against their Roman master. Led by Spartacus and Crixus, the rebels overwhelm their trainers and prison guards, force Lentulus Batiatus to retreat from his villa to Capua, and destroy the city garrison sent to stop them. Narrative structure The novel changes between third-person omniscient past and present tenses. The narrative structure is based on several members of the Roman ruling hierarchy (Crassus, Gracchus, Caius, and Cicero) who, using the past tense, are shown meeting to relate tales of the events in Spartacus's life and uprising. The tales are told in the present tense directly by the narrator, with details going far beyond the Romans' possible knowledge. The novel deviates from and extends known historical facts. In particular, the real Gaius Gracchus died about ten years before the birth of Spartacus. Theme The novel's central theme is that man's most basic universal values are freedom, love, hope, and finally life. Oppression and slavery strip these away until the oppressed have nothing to lose by uprising. Oppressive systems are held together by political systems. Spartacus stands as an eternal symbol of how man must fight against political systems that oppress man's values: Publication Howard Fast self-published the novel in the United States during the McCarthy era in 1951. He began writing it as a reaction to his imprisonment for charges stemming from his earlier involvement in the Communist Party USA. He had refused to disclose to Congress the names of contributors to a fund for a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War. He was imprisoned for three months in 1950 for contempt of Congress. The final page of the first edition describes some of his difficulties in publishing: The cover illustration of the first edition is by African-American artist Charles White. In the 1991 paperback version (ibooks, distributed by Simon & Schuster; ), the author has a short introduction, \\"Spartacus and the Blacklist\\", which expands on the conditions surrounding the writing and publishing of the work.

He was born in Deerfield, Massachusetts, educated at Deerfield Academy, and worked as a farmer. In 1844 he married Susan Stewart Stearns of Dummerston, Vermont, and from 1853 to 1857 lived in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In 1857 he was appointed Justice of the Peace at Deerfield and in 1867 was elected as a representative to the General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts. In 1872 he was elected state senator. His first wife died in 1881. In 1897 he remarried; his second wife was the scientist and historian Jennie Maria Arms. Sheldon's interest in history and historical preservation began in 1848, when Deerfield's Old Indian House (the first home occupied by the Sheldon Family in Deerfield) was demolished despite the objections of local residents. Sheldon, along with others, were able to preserve only the door of the house and some architectural fragments. In 1868, he and others erected a monument to honor the town's Civil War soldiers. Two years later, they decided to mark the spot where Eunice Williams, the wife of John Williams, was murdered during the 1704 Deerfield Massacre. From that, the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association was born in 1870, and Sheldon would serve as its president until his death in 1916. The Association founded the Memorial Hall Museum, which houses much of Sheldon's collection, in 1880.Amelia F. Miller and AR Riggs.

Sheldon was named president of the Association, a post he held to his death. Although he split his time between Deerfield and Boston, he remained an important voice in town issues and a dynamic leader of the Memorial Association.

The station aired a comedy radio format branded as Funny 1410. The station broadcast with a power of 10,000 watts from its transmitter site located on Scotland Drive in South London. The station's coverage area was directional to the north and south during the day, and towards the north at night to protect WDOE in Dunkirk, New York, located across Lake Erie from CKSL. CKSL was owned by Bell Media, along with CJBX, CIQM and CJBK. The station was launched in June 1956 on AM 1290 (the current home of CJBK), and moved to its current frequency in 1964. The station later adopted a Top 40 format, and subsequently changed to news/talk in 1993 known as AM 1410. It changed to an adult standards format under the same name in 1996, evolving into a soft adult contemporary format as AM 1410, The River in September 1997. Logo as \\"Oldies 1410\\" (2009-2012)In 2000, the station was acquired by Telemedia, who changed it to an oldies format as \\"Oldies 1410\\" on December 1, 2000. Standard Broadcasting subsequently acquired Telemedia in 2002, and the format changed back to adult standards as AM 1410 on February 16, 2004. By this point the station only broadcast live from 6-9 a.m. weekdays, with the rest of the time being automated. During the Oldies 1410 years, the station also broadcast various religious and ethnic programs in evenings, including Radio Maryja from Poland seven days a week from 8-9 p.m. Due in part to the location of its transmitter site in South London, CKSL has been dogged by low listenership. The municipal landfill site is located just south of the transmitter site, causing increasing deterioration of the signal as the landfill has grown over the years. CKSL applied to move to the FM dial at 102.3 MHz in 1999, but the license for 102.3 MHz was awarded to CHUM who subsequently launched CHST-FM. CKSL presently has the lowest audience share in the London market, according to BBM Canada. In 2007 Astral Media took control of CKSL as a result of a takeover of Standard Radio. In fall 2009, CKSL moved back to an oldies format, again using the \\"Oldies 1410\\" as its moniker. In November 2011, CKSL announced that it would change formats by January 2012 to become the first radio station in Canada devoted to comedy radio. The new format, \\"Funny 1410\\", consist of bits performed by major stand-up and improvisational comedians. The new format was originally programmed by Astral Media's syndication arm,http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20111124/london-radio-station-all- comedy-111124/ but would later pick up its programming from the American 24/7 Comedy network, of which Astral (and later, Bell Media) was the authorised Canadian distributor. In early 2013, the station would add Astral's late night Humble & Fred show.\\"Humble And Fred Return To Radio Via Astral Media, CFRB\\". Mediabase, January 14, 2013. It was a short time after this that Bell Media would acquire many of Astral's radio stations, including CKSL. Announced closure of CKSL On July 11, 2016, Bell Media applied to the CRTC for a request to terminate CKSL's broadcast license, citing severe deteriorating conditions at the transmitter site. A technical review was done at the location of CKSL's transmitter building and towers by Bell Media and its contractors, and they found that the AM array's broadcast towers posed a structural risk, as well as needing their aircraft warning lights to be repaired to bring it back up to proper building, safety and aircraft codes. The transmitter building was also found to have shifted off its foundation. The cost estimate to repair all these issues was in the $CAD 3 million range, and with CKSL's long-term ratings performance at dead last of the ten commercial radio stations serving the London area, and with little hope of that changing any time soon, coupled with the region's four per cent decline of advertising revenue in radio since 2013, the CRTC accepted Bell's request to shut down CKSL. The station was scheduled to cease operations on August 14, 2016, at midnight.\\"London‚Äôs CKSL-AM Funny 1410 To Sign Off August 14\\" Broadcaster, August 9, 2016.

It is primarily intended for internal security and police units, it was adopted by the Russian police and MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry). Design details The OTS-02 is a blowback- operated weapon of a conventional design chambered in 9√ó18mm Makarov. The receiver is made from pressed steel with a synthetic plastic pistol grip. It feeds from stamped steel detachable straight box magazines, inserted into a well in front of the trigger guard with either a 20 or 30-round cartridge capacity. The weapon has a rudimentary steel skeletonized stock which folds up and over the receiver when folded, in such a manner that the simple base plate outline extends downwards to either side of the muzzle. The Kiparis is supplied with a proprietary sound suppressor with a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds, the same service life as the barrel. The OTS-02 Kiparis can also accommodate a red dot sight or a tactical laser pointer which clips on forward of the magazine housing in such a way that the bottom of the laser aiming device can act as a forward grip during aiming.

Located in the northern Negev desert around south-east of Beersheba, it falls under the jurisdiction of Bnei Shimon Regional Council. In it had a population of . The nearest settlements are the Bedouin towns of Tel as-Sabi to the north and Shaqib al-Salam to the south. At a greater distance to the northeast lies Nevatim Israeli Air Force Base, named after the moshav. History Nevatim was originally established in 1946 by Jewish olim from Hungary as one of the 11 points in the Negev, its name taken from the Tanakh. In the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War the surrounding area, including the city of Beersheba, was briefly captured by the Egyptian Army. The Egyptians besieged Nevatim, along with the neighboring village of Beit Eshel which was destroyed and subsequently abandoned. Nevatim managed to hold on throughout the siege, as the villages received air-dropped supplies and most Egyptian efforts were concentrated on continuing northwards. Although both were dismantled after the war, Nevatim was re-established at a slightly different location in 1954 by Cochin Jews, who had immigrated from Kochi, India. Economy Cochin synagogue, Nevatim About half of Nevatim's workers are employed in the village, primarily in agriculture, while the rest work in the nearby industrial areas of Beersheba, Dimona and Ramat Hovav. Local employment has gradually diversified, especially into the tourism and service, a move sustained by the moshav's guest houses and the Cochin heritage center. The moshav's synagogue is a duplicate of one in Cochin, and incorporates some elements of the original building. It also houses a cultural center and museum about the Jews of Cochin. A restaurant serving Cochini food and pastries caters to tourists. The community also has a swimming pool and a mikvah. In May 2017, an extension of the railway from Beersheba to Arad via Kuseife was approved. The line would connect to the existing Beersheba-Dimona rail line at a proposed new rail station at Nevatim.

They include oligosaccharides and sulfated polysaccharides of plant, animal, or synthetic origin. One study has been conducted on heparinoids. Heparinoids, like heparin, act by interacting with heparin binding proteins, generally through ionic interactions or hydrogen bonding. Some examples of heparin binding proteins include antithrombin III. It is thought that much protein interaction with heparin is not direct, and instead heparin binding protein actually interact with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains or mucins bound to the heparin polymer, so it is possible that heparinoids interact with these proteins in a similar way, acquiring GAG side chains in vivo. One counter example is the protein chymase, which directly binds to heparin. Sulfated polysaccharides = From animal tissues = Dermatan sulfate is one example of a compound that is classified as a heparinoid. It is a naturally-occurring polysaccharide of O-sulfated N-acetyl-D-galatosamine, L-iduronic acid, and D-glucuronic acid that has been clinically used as an antithrombotic agent. Chondroitin sulfate shows slightly less biological activity than dermatan sulfate, and is composed of O-sulfated N-acetyl-D-galatosamine and D-glucuronic acid. It is theorized that this change in efficacy is related to the absence of L-induronic acid, which affects the flexibility of the polymer chain. Acharan sulfate is a heparinoid that is naturally produced by the giant African land snail, Achatina fulica. Keratan sulfate is a heparinoid that is a component of cartilage. It is found in the cornea. Chitin, a component of insect shells and fungal structures, can be de-N-acetylated to form chitosan, which when sulfated has a significant chemical similarity to heparin. In fact, it inhibits thrombin by affecting ATIII. Lepirudin is a recombinant preparation of the polypeptide anticoagulant secreted by leeches and is used in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia. = From plant sources = Fucoidan is a polymer composed of sulfated L-fucose. Carrageenans are isolated from algae. Hyaluronan functions as a heparinoid when it is sulfated. Intra- articular injections of hyaluronic acid are used to mitigate pain and treat symptoms of osteoarthritis in the knee, but such injections are correlated with increased risk of serious side effects. Alginic acid functions as a heparinoid when it is sulfated. Pentosan from the bark of Fagus sylvatica, when sulfated, acts with 1/10th of the efficacy of heparin. = From microbial sources = K5 polysaccharide from E. coli acts as a heparinoid when it is sulfated. History Heparin was first isolated from dog liver by medical student Jay McClean in 1916. Jorpes discovered the structure of the heparin polysaccharide in 1935, identifying that it is a highly sulfated polymer of glycosaminoglycoglycan (GAG) and uronic acid. Around that time, heparin began to be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of post-operative thrombosis. Production There is no industrial process for the complete synthesis of heparin; Heparin is isolated from animal tissue - generally bovine lung, porcine, and intestinal mucosa. Heparinoids generally are also naturally- occurring polysaccharides, and similarly need to be purified from the plant or animal tissue that produces them. Regulation There is no internationally accepted molecular standard for the composition of heparin, as it is a complex polymer of GAG units and uronic acids (including D-glucuronic acid, L-iduronic acid, and D-glucosamine). Position of N-acetyl, N-sulfate, and O-sulfate groups in these uronic acids can vary, as can the branching patterns of the chain. This generates an extraordinary amount of variability between molecules of heparin. Current USP standards for heparin limit levels of contamination with dermatan, chondroitin, and over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, as well as galactosamine levels in the sample, as determined by HPLC, H-NMR, and Strong Anion Exchange Chromatography.USP Safety Data Sheet: Heparin Sodium with Oversulfated Chondroitin Sulfate. http://static.usp.org/pdf/EN/referenceStandards/msds/1304050.pdf Accessed on 11/30/2015.

His Professional Photoshop series (first edition 1994, currently in its fifth edition, 2006) is widely viewed as an authoritative work in the field of digital color correction of photographs. His Photoshop LAB Color: The Canyon Conundrum and Other Adventures in the Most Powerful Colorspace (first edition 2005, second edition 2015) established the usage of L*a*b* as a standard part of the repertory of high-end retouchers. His magazine column, Makeready, which ran from 1993 to 2006, introduced many concepts in color handling that have since become accepted practice in the industry. The column appeared in several publications worldwide. In its later years, it was carried simultaneously by Electronic Publishing and Photoshop User magazines in the United States. Body of work The work of Margulis is associated with the concept that digital color correction should seek to correspond to what a human observer would see if placed in the position of the camera. He popularized, but did not originate, a method he described as \\"color by the numbers\\", which requires the retoucher to verify that certain values in the digital file agree with known standards. His techniques attempt to emulate certain well-known reactions/attributes of the human visual system, such as chromatic adaptation and simultaneous contrast. He has identified several other characteristics of human perception that he states should be taken into account when processing a digital image. These include assertions that humans prefer fuller and richer tonality in the quartertone region than cameras customarily provide, that humans subconsciously use saturation as a measure of an object's distance, and that humans do not focus on strongly colored objects as intensely as on more neutral ones. Other theoretical suggestions made by Margulis include: * In conversions from color to black and white, the objective is to identify areas of contrasting color and adjust them to substitute contrast in luminosity.Keeping the Color in Black and White, Electronic Publishing magazine, March, 1993 * Identification of the A channel of L*a*b* (usually written as LAB by imaging professionals) as operating on a magenta-green axis, as opposed to the red-green axis described in previous technical works.Professional Photoshop 5, 1998 Image-processing techniques published or authored by Margulis include: * The concept of assigning important image regions to the steepest parts of input-output channel curves (\\"the steeper the curve, the more the contrast\\").Introduced in \\"Color, Curves, and Horsetrading,\\" Computer Artist magazine, August 1994 * Use of channel blending to enhance detail in weaker channels.\\"Plate Blending as Poetry\\", three articles, Computer Artist magazine, August‚ÄìDecember 1998 * Overlay blending to enhance highlight and/or shadow detail.\\"Making Two Ends Meet\\", Electronic Publishing magazine, September 2004 * Using different styles of black generation (gray component replacement, or GCR) to avoid press problems or to make color correction easier.\\"GCR: Color as a Four-Letter Word\\" and \\"In Color Correction, the Key Is the K\\", Computer Artist magazine, October‚ÄìDecember 1993 *Unsharp masking by channel rather than overall.\\"Hittin' 'em Where They Ain't\\", Computer Artist magazine, April 1998 *Emphasizing the darkening function of sharpening at the expense of lightening.\\"Sharpening With a Stiletto\\", Computer Artist magazine, February 1998 *The \\"Man from Mars Method\\" of driving colors apart without regard to whether gray balance is altered.\\"The Man From Mars Method\\", Electronic Publishing magazine, March 2005 *LAB as a primary tool in color correction.\\"Color, Contrast and LAB\\" and \\"LAB Meets the Matador\\", Computer Artist magazine, June‚ÄìAugust 1996 *Blurring the AB channels of LAB to reduce colored noise.Makeready, 1996 *Assigning a \\"false profile\\" to an RGB image so that it will be interpreted as lighter during subsequent conversions.\\"Fate and the False Profile\\", Electronic Publishing magazine, August 2001 *High Radius, Low Amount (\\"hiraloam\\") method of unsharp masking.Seybold Conference, Fall 2002; \\"Life on the Edge\\", Electronic Publishing magazine, January 2005 *Uniting separate versions of the same image through use of masks that, although based on the original photograph, have been blurred beyond recognition.Professional Photoshop Fifth Edition, 2006 At a presentation to MIT faculty and graduate students in 2007, Margulis introduced the \\"picture-postcard workflow\\", which he claimed to yield better correction results in shorter times than did traditional methods of image enhancement. He proposed a three-stage approach. First, any obvious problems with color are corrected. Second, contrast is enhanced without changing the color of the first step. Third, more pleasing color is incorporated, usually in LAB. The proposal suggested replacing the traditional method of color correction, where one step is intended to solve color and contrast problems simultaneously. The new workflow was set out in detail, with accompanying video presentations, in his 2013 book Modern Photoshop Color Workflow. In 2020, Margulis released a new translation, with substantial supporting material and graphics, of the classic 1839 text On the Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colors by M.E. Chevreul. In 2001, Margulis was one of the first three members, and the only writer, inducted into the Photoshop Hall of Fame. In the United States, his small-group, hands-on courses in these subjects are sponsored by Sterling Ledet & Associates, Inc. In Europe, he has taught in German, Italian, Spanish and English.

It is stationed at Goodfellow Air Force Base, Texas. The wing is also the host unit at Goodfellow. The wing is responsible for the training of intelligence personnel in all the branches of the armed forces, as well as firefighters and a few other specialties. Its 17th Training Group is a successor of the 17th Pursuit Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II, which later became the 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) and provided the crews and aircraft for the Doolittle Raid. The 17th Training Wing is commanded by Colonel Andres Nazario. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant Lavor Kirkpatrick. Mission Stood up as a non-flying wing on 1 July 1993. Its mission is to train intelligence personnel in all the branches of the armed forces, as well as firefighters and a few other specialties. The wing trains Air Force enlisted intelligence, cryptology and linguist AFSCs 1N0, 1N1, 1N2, 1N3, 1N4, 1N5, 1A8, Air Force intelligence officer AFSC 14N, and military firefighters from all branches. Many corresponding Army, Navy and Marine Corps intelligence personnel are also trained at Goodfellow AFB, and assigned to the local units. Heraldry The unit's emblem, approved 2 November 1937, features seven crosses denoting the seven World War I campaign honors of its 95th Bomb Squadron. Active for over 50 years, the wing was a component organization of Strategic Air Command's deterrent force during the Cold War, as a strategic bombardment and later a strategic reconnaissance wing. History : See 17th Bombardment Group for additional history and lineage information prior to 1952 =Korean War= Established as the 17th Bombardment Wing, Light on 8 May 1952 and assigned to the Far East Air Forces Fifth Air Force. The wing was activated two days later at Pusan-East Air Base (K-9), South Korea, where it replaced the Air Force Reserve 452d Bombardment Wing Light when its activation ended. Its 17th Bombardment Group acquired the World War II-era 452d's Douglas A-26 Invaders. The Invader had proven to be the only bomber suited to the night interdiction role in Korea. Unfortunately, the Invader was capable of visual-only operations and was available only in dwindling numbers. Operational squadrons of the 17th BG were the 34th, 37th and 95th Bombardment Squadrons. The wing conducted combat operations during the Korean War, 10 May 1952 ‚Äì 27 July 1953, including night intruder light bombardment missions against enemy supply centers, communications and transportation facilities; interdiction of North Korean railroads; armed reconnaissance; and close air support for ground forces. Remaining in South Korea for over a year after the armistice that ended combat as a deterrent force, the wing moved to Miho AB, Japan on 10 October 1954, where it maintained operational proficiency for light bombardment. It was inactivated on 20 March 1955. =Tactical Air Command= The unit was reactivated in the United States on 1 April 1955 and assigned to Ninth Air Force of Tactical Air Command (TAC). It was stationed at Eglin Air Force Base Aiuxiliary Field No. 9, Florida where it was programmed to receive the Martin B-57 Canberra, the replacement for the B-26. On 1 October 1955, it was redesignated the 17th Bombardment Wing, Tactical and received B-57B aircraft in early 1956. It flew B-57s in 1956 and 1957, however the aircraft was troublesome and unreliable, and was retired from the inventory quickly. In 1956 deliveries of the Douglas B-66B Destroyer began and by July 1957 the wing had become the sole USAF wing to be equipped with this model of the Destroyer, which it operated until inactivating in 1958.Knaack, p. 433 The first B-66 arrived from Norton Air Force Base, California, on 16 March 1956.Hamilton, Percy, \\"'Combat Outfit Again' ‚Äì Hurlburt Wing Paces Air Force With New Jet\\", Playground News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Thursday, 22 March 1956, Volume 11, Number 7, page 1. In late 1957, TAC began to transfer its Destroyers to the 47th Bombardment Wing of United States Air Forces Europe and the 17th was inactivated on 25 June 1958.Knaack, pp. 435‚Äì436 =Strategic Air Command= =4043d Strategic Wing= Emblem of the 4043d Strategic Wing The 17th was assigned to Strategic Air Command and redesignated as the 17th Bombardment Wing, Heavy and organized on 1 February 1963 at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The 17th's origins under SAC began on 1 April 1959 when Strategic Air Command organized the 4039th Strategic Wing (SW) at Wright-Patterson and assigned it to the 40th Air Division on 1 July as part of SAC's plan to disperse its B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The wing remained a headquarters only until 15 September 1959 when the 66th Aviation Depot Squadron was activated to oversee the wing's special weapons. In October three maintenance squadrons and a squadron to provide security for the wing's aircraft and weapons were added, but it was not until 1 December that the wing's first flying squadron, the 922d Air Refueling Squadron, flying Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers was activated and assigned. The wing was fully organized on 1 June 1960 when the 42d Bombardment Squadron (BS), consisting of 15 Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses moved to Wright-Patterson from Altus AFB, Oklahoma where it had been one of the three squadrons of the 11th Bombardment Wing. Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962. In 1962, the wing's bombers began to be equipped with the GAM-77 Hound Dog and the GAM-72 Quail air-launched cruise missiles, The 4042d Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron was activated in November to maintain these missiles. =Reactivation of the 17th Bombardment Wing= Emblem of the SAC 17th Bombardment Wing In 1962, in order to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its Major Command controlled (MAJCON) strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate Air Force controlled (AFCON) units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history.MAJCON units could not carry a permanent history or lineage. The 4043d SW was replaced by the 17th Bombardment Wing (17th BW) on 1 February 1963 and was assigned to SAC's 40th AD.In addition to its own history, the 17th Wing also continued, through temporary bestowal, the history, and honors of the 17th Bombardment Group. It was also entitled to retain the honors, but not the history or lineage, of the 4043d. The 922d Air Refueling Squadron and 66th Munitions Maintenance Squadron transferred to the 17th. The 42d BS was replaced by the 34th Bombardment Squadron, one of the unit's World War II historical bomb squadrons and the 4043d's maintenance and security squadrons were replaced by ones with the 17th numerical designation of the newly activated wing. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor. Under the Dual Deputate organization, all components were directly assigned to the wing, no operational or maintenance group element was activated. The history, lineage and honors of the 17th Bombardment Group were temporarily bestowed upon the newly established wing upon activation. The 17th Bomb Wing trained to maintain proficiency in strategic bombing and aerial refueling on a global basis. It furnished B-52s and KC-135 aircraft and crews to deployed SAC wings in the western Pacific and Thailand that were engaged in combat operations over Southeast Asia as part of the Vietnam War from 1966 to 1975. The 17th BW was taken off alert at Wright- Patterson AFB, OH, on 30 June 1975 and phased down, transferring aircraft by 7 July as part of SAC's inactivation at Wright-Patterson. It was reassigned without personnel or equipment to Beale AFB, California, on 30 September 1975 and absorbed resources of the 456th Bombardment Wing, including B-52G and KC-135Q aircraft. At Beale, the 17th continued global strategic bombardment alert to 30 June 1976 and used tanker aircraft primarily to refuel SR-71s of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. The wing was inactivated on 30 September 1976 and replaced by the 100th Air Refueling Wing as part of a realignment of SAC assets. The wing was reactivated at RAF Alconbury England as the 17th Reconnaissance Wing on 1 October 1982. The operational squadron of the 17th RW was the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron. The wing flew tactical and strategic surveillance missions in Western Europe using the TR-1 (U-2R). It received the P. T. Cullen Trophy for providing \\"the greatest contribution to the intelligence gathering efforts of SAC\\" in 1989 and 1990.Mixer, Ronald E., Genealogy of the STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND, Battermix Publishing Company, 1999 and Mixer, Ronald E., STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND, An Organizational History, Battermix Publishing Company, 2006. During 1990‚Äì91, many of the wing's assets and personnel supported Gulf War operations by ferrying aircraft and equipment to Taif, Saudi Arabia. The 17th RW inactivated on 30 June 1991, but its subordinate unit, the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron, remained at Alconbury as a non-flying organization until 15 September 1993. The U-2Rs were consolidated at Beale AFB California in the 9th Wing. When the wing was reactivated in July 1993, it initially comprised the 17th Training Group, 17th Medical Group, and 17th Mission Support Group. There are 17 TRW units at the Defense Language Institute, Corry Station, and Fort Huachuca, AZ which also do intelligence training. The wing is also responsible for writing the CDCs for the AFSCs which it trains.

It belongs to the Mascarene owls of the genus Mascarenotus, and most likely was similar to a long-eared owl in size and appearance, but with nearly naked legs. However, according to recent studies, it and its relatives may belong to the genus Otus, and is likely descended from the Otus sunia lineage. Compared to the Mauritius owl and the Rodrigues owl, it was the most terrestrial species of the genus, with long legs and possibly somewhat reduced flight capability; more probably though it was simply smaller than the Mauritius bird ‚Äì between that species and the one from Rodrigues in size ‚Äì but had equally long legs: the only suitable food available in quantity on R√©union were small birds. It can be assumed to have preyed on sleeping songbirds in the manner of the unrelated but convergent Grallistrix \\"stilt-owls\\" from Hawaii. Extinction As the bird is not mentioned by any contemporary report, it was either very secretive or became extinct earlier than its congeners. Notably, it is not contained in the comprehensive listing of local fauna that Dubois made in 1671‚Äì72. At that time, the only introduced predators were pigs. Inferring from the local ecology, it is likely that the birds succumbed to predation by rats and perhaps also cats as they must have been flight worthy enough to avoid the pigs, and thus only became extinct after Dubois' visit, at some date closer to the year 1700. If the bird was ground-nesting, however, it might have been extinct even by the time Dubois did not record it, but this hypothesis does not seem to agree what can be inferred from the rather long survival of its Mauritius relative.

They also form the backbone for DNA and RNA. Sugar phosphate backbone geometry is altered in the vicinity of the modified nucleotides. Examples include: * Dihydroxyacetonephosphate * Glucose-6-phosphate * Phytic acid * Teichoic acid  Electronic structure of the sugar-phosphate backbone  The sugar-phosphate backbone has multiplex electronic structure and the electron delocalisation complicates its theoretical description. Some part of the electronic density is delocalised over the whole backbone and the extent of the delocalisation is affected by backbone conformation due to hyper- conjugation effects. Hyper-conjugation arises from donor-acceptor interactions of localised orbitals in 1,3 positions.  Phosphodiesters in DNA and RNA  The phosphodiester backbone of DNA and RNA consists of pairs of deoxyribose or ribose sugars linked by phosphates at the respective 3' and 5' positions. The backbone is negatively charged and hydrophilic, which allows strong interactions with water. Sugar-phosphate backbone forms the structural framework of nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA. Sugar phosphates are defined as carbohydrates to which a phosphate group is bound by an ester or an either linkage, depending on whether it involves an alcoholic or a hemiacetalic hydroxyl, respectively. Solubility, acid hydrolysis rates, acid strengths, and ability to act as sugar group donors are the knowledge of physical and chemical properties required for the analysis of both types of sugar phosphates. The photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle is closely associated with sugar phosphates, and sugar phosphates are one of the key molecules in metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathways, gluconeogenesis, important intermediates in glycolysis. Sugar phosphates are not only involved in metabolic regulation and signaling but also involved in the synthesis of other phosphate compounds.  Peptide nucleic acids  Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a nucleic acid in which natural nucleic acid has been replaced by a synthetic peptide backbone formed from N-(2-amino- ethyl)-glycine units along with sugar phosphate backbone forming in an achiral and uncharged moiety that mimics RNA or DNA oligonucleotides. PNA cannot be degraded inside living cells but it is chemically stable and resistant to hydrolytic (enzymatic) cleavage.  Role in metabolism  Sugar phosphates are major players in metabolism due to their task of storing and transferring energy. Not only ribose 5-phosphate but also fructose 6-phosphate are an intermediate of the pentose-phosphate pathway which generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and pentoses from glucose polymers and their degradation products. The pathway is known as glycolysis where the same carbohydrates are degraded into pyruvates thus providing energy. Enzymes are catalysed for the reactions of these pathways. Some enzymes contain metal centers in their active site which is important part of the enzymes and as well as for the catalysed reaction. The phosphate group can coordinate to the metal center for example, 1,6-bisphosphatase and ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. Phosphoglycerate and several sugar phosphates that are known intermediates of the Calvin photosynthetic carbon cycle, stimulate light-dependent carbon dioxide fixation by isolated chloroplasts. This ability is shared by certain other metabolites (e.g. glucose 1-phosphate) from which the accepted Calvin- cycle intermediates could easily be derived by known metabolic routes.

Early life and education Career =As columnist and blogger = Eckler was employed by the National Post from 2000 to 2005, when she was among a number of staff let go by the CanWest newspaper chain. From March‚ÄìDecember 2006, Eckler wrote \\"Mommy Blogger\\", a weekly freelance piece in The Globe and Mail, appending to this set of blogs a departing blog on May 2007. From 2003 until April 2008 she wrote Post City's Shopgirl column. Eckler began writing bloc post appearing periodically in the Canadian periodical, Maclean's, in 2008, which has continued through 2016. Eckler's work also appeared in Mademoiselle. Eckler was the host of the short-lived television show Modern Manners, and has appeared on CTV and CBC television. She has also worked for Global television as a reporter. =As book author= Eckler became pregnant with her daughter, Rowan Joely, on the night of her engagement party, and published the 2004 book Knocked Up: Confessions of a Hip Mother-to-Be about her first pregnancy. The book received mostly negative reviews. In April 2007, Eckler publisher her second book, Wiped! Life with a Pint-Sized Dictator, which chronicles her first two years of motherhood. Quill & Quire said the book was a \\"series of tired clich√©s about parenthood.\\" Wiped! has otherwise received negative reviews in Canadian dailies. Eckler published Blissfully Blended Bullshit with Dundurn Press in 2019, on managing life with a blended family. Controversies Eckler's writing has elicited controversy. For instance, there was international coverage of the responses to her blogging about her decision to leave her 10-month old infant to join her fianc√© for the duration of a celebrity golf tournament in Mexico. Responses to her book and blog content have frequently included assessments of writing from privilege, shallowness and immaturity, and self-justification of non- traditional decisions. Eckler's blog, NinePoundDictator, prompted the creation of a parody blog, NineGramBrain, which was noted in The Toronto Star, a site that appeared until December 2007. In mid-2007, Eckler filed a lawsuit against Universal Studios, alleging copyright infringement for similarities between her book and the 2007 comedy film Knocked Up. Judd Apatow, the movie's producer and director, said the book and movie were \\"very different.\\" As of this date, the lawsuit had not settled. Personal life Eckler's home was referenced in the April 2007 edition of Canadian House and Home. In 2007, Eckler participated in a charity auction for the magazine The Walrus, paying $7,000 for the right to have a character in Margaret Atwood's novel The Year of the Flood named after her.

History and mission  The Crefeld School was founded as The Miquon Upper School in 1970 by Arnold Greenberg. Greenberg, a former teacher at The Miquon School (a private progressive elementary school founded in 1932), created the new upper school partly in response to requests from parents and former students from The Miquon School who wanted the opportunity to continue their schooling in the tradition of progressive education. Greenberg was granted permission by The Miquon School's board to include the \\"Miquon\\" name in the title of his new school, but the two schools were always entirely independent of each other.

There are more than 50 species described in the genus, plus many synonyms and subspecies. A new species (Coccothrinax spirituana) was described as recently as 2017. Many Coccothrinax produce thatch. In Spanish-speaking countries, guano is a common name applied to Coccothrinax palms. The species are native throughout the Caribbean, the Bahamas, extreme southern Florida and southeastern Mexico, but most of the species are known only from Cuba.Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden ‚Äì Coccothrinax ‚Äì URL retrieved June 24, 2006Morici, Carlo. 2002. Coccothrinax boschiana. Palms 41:1. ‚Äì URL retrieved June 24, 2006ePalmetum: Species in the genus Coccothrinax ‚Äì URL retrieved June 24, 2006 Description Detail of the stem of Coccothrinax scoparia showing fibrous leaf sheaths Coccothrinax is a genus of small to medium-sized, fan palms with relatively slender stems and 8 to 22 palmate leaves. The stems are initially covered by fibrous leaf sheaths. These break down into a network of fibres or spines, eventually leaving a bare trunk covered with leaf scars. The undersides of the leaflets are often silvery-grey; this is reflected in the common name \\"silver palm\\", which is given to many species of Coccothrinax. The base of the petiole is not split longitudinally. The absence of this trait is a distinguishing character that separates Coccothrinax from Thrinax. Coccothrinax species bear branched inflorescences that are located among the leaves. The bisexual flowers, which are borne on short stalks, have between 6 and 13 stamens and a single carpel. The fruit are small, single-seeded, and range in colour from purple-red to purple-black, to brown. The seeds are deeply grooved \\"and resemble a brain\\". Taxonomy The genus Coccothrinax was first described by American botanist Charles Sprague Sargent in 1899. He split the genus away from Thrinax based on characteristics of the fruit and seeds. The genus was based on Sargent's description of C. jucunda (now C. argentata) and C. garberi (also synonymised with C. argentata). He also assigned Thrinax argentea and T. radiata to the genus; while the former is now recognised as part of Coccothrinax, the latter remains in Thrinax. The generic epithet combines \\"coccus\\", the Latin word for berry, with Thrinax. Coccothrinax is the most diverse genus of Caribbean palms. Although Andrew Henderson and colleagues only recognised fourteen species in their 1995 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, the current World Checklist of Arecaceae recognises 52 or 53 species. Coccothrinax is placed in the tribe Cryosophileae. Distribution Coccothrinax is a primarily Caribbean genus‚Äîit is found throughout the insular Caribbean, and in adjacent areas of Mexico and Florida. Species are usually found in dry, open or exposed habitats, on limestone, serpentine or sandy soils. Coccothrinax argentata ranges from Florida and the Florida Keys, through the Bahamas and San Andr√©s Island to southeastern Mexico. Coccothrinax barbadensis ranges through the Lesser Antilles to Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands Antilles. The remaining species have narrower distributions; many are known from single populations in Cuba or Hispaniola. Botanic gardens Large collections are grown in Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (more than 250 plants, more than 23 species), in Miami, Florida, Jard√≠n Bot√°nico Nacional (15 species) in Havana, Cuba, and Palmetum of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (more than 1,000 Thrinax and Coccothrinx plants), in the Canary Islands, Spain.

Chartered Accountants Ireland is a founding member of the chartered accountants body, Chartered Accountants Worldwide.http://www.charteredaccountantsworldwide.com/about-us/ History Chartered Accountants Ireland was established under a royal charter in 1888. This original body was name the 'Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland'.https://www.charteredaccountants.ie/about-us The body has been a member of the International Federation of Accountants since 1977.https://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members/chartered-accountants- ireland Organisation The council is the highest governance organ of the institute.

They initiated an investigation into the \\"circumstances around the issue of inappropriate directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank\\" and into the performance of Ernst and Young. In 2009, independent Senator Shane Ross said the Institute \\"ranks with the Central Bank of Ireland as the winner of the wooden spoon for watchdogs\\". The first Chairman of the Regulatory Board, had companies he is a director of, fined a total of ‚Ç¨3.35 million by the Central Bank of Ireland, for risk control and reporting failures. In 2009 Chartered Accountants House on Pearse St., was officially opened by President McAleese, with new resources for its members and conferencing facilities.Speech by President Mary McAleese at official opening of Chartered Accountants House Tuesday, 8 December 2009 An external inquiry team in February 2010 found that the Institute's complaints committee had a prima facie case to answer for the conduct of its proceedings and there were further apparent flaws in the accountancy body's disciplinary procedures. The Irish Times, the country's newspaper of record, in April 2010 raised questions about the role of Institute Members in relation to the crisis affecting the banking sector and an insurance company. Within days, an opinion piece in the respected Sunday Business Post said \\"what a glorious contribution that body of super-chargers made to the collapse of business and of the entire financial system here and how they have got away with it\\". The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), the independent body entrusted with overseeing corporate governance in the accountancy profession, in November 2010, fined the Institute of Chartered Accountants ‚Ç¨10,000. It described the Chartered Accountants Ireland's complaints committee's behaviour as a \\"substantive failure and not merely a technical\\" one. The next week in November 2010, it was announced that the policing of audits of publicly quoted companies is being taken out of the hands of professional accounting bodies and transferred to the state's auditing watchdog. The move of the role to an independent, state-run body is seen as a more stringent approach to enforcing audit standards. This follows on from an EU recommendation that member states needed to ‚Äò‚Äòup their game‚Äô‚Äô in the monitoring of public interest bodies. The next month Irish accountancy firms and auditors who worked with the Irish banks during the previous three years were barred from doing key stress tests on behalf of the Central Bank of Ireland and the International Monetary Fund. The Director of Corporate Enforcement, Paul Appleby, in February 2011 said, there were grounds for questioning \\"the consistency and quality of audit work within the profession\\". Mr Appleby also said auditors \\"report surprisingly few types of company law offences to us\\", with the so-called \\"big four\\" auditing firms reporting the least often to his office, at just 5pc of all reports. He had taken issue on \\"numerous occasions\\" with the quality of audit work and audit reports issued by accountants. \\"Occasionally, this has resulted in admissions of lapses, and where appropriate, in revised audit reports being issued.\\" At the same time, the Revenue Commissioners said \\"that current audits said little about the business model of firms or their liquidity position\\". The state's auditing watchdog warned Irish listed companies that it wants to see better financial reporting in 2011, after stating that it has been \\"disappointed\\" by Irish plcs. An April 2011 reporthttp://www.bankinginquiry.gov.ie/Documents/Misjuding%20Risk%20-%20Causes%20of%20the%20Systemic%20Banking%20Crisis%20in%20Ireland.pdf into the Irish banking collapse criticised the role of external auditors in failing to identify and warn of the risky lending practices being adopted by Irish banks. It said auditors took a narrow interpretation of their job description and remained \\"silent\\" during the excesses of the boom. It found the external auditors of the main Irish banks consistently failed to report \\"excesses over prudential sector lending limits\\" to the Central Bank of Ireland. In July 2011, the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board was fined a record ‚Ç¨110,000 by IAASA, the third time the Institute was fined in the space of eight months. It called CARB's failure to comply its own procedures on five occasions as \\" serious\\" and found that the Chartered Accountants' Institute recklessly \\"communicated inaccurate and misleading information\\" to the complainant. A week after the Irish Government pumped ‚Ç¨1 billion into Credit Unions in October 2011, the Central Bank issued a strong warning to auditors they do not sign off on any accounts unless proper provisions are made for bad debts. Later in the same month the Central Bank again put the work of Auditors under the microscope following their failure to spot systematic and large- scale abuse of client funds at an Investment Firm. In July 2012, the Institute was criticised when it was discovered that it charged Trainee Accountants in the Republic ‚Ç¨600 more than those in Northern Ireland for doing exactly the same course. Following the publication of a report by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2012, the Irish Times in an acid commentary said it speaks \\" of a profession that lost its way and, rather than provide a check on rule- bending in financial services, became a willing and well-paid accomplice.\\"https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/1015/1224325258750.html#.UHwGYBlQsNw.twitter In February 2013, Michel Barnier, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, questioned the conduct of the auditors of Irish banks which lead to the financial crash. The Central Bank of Ireland in January 2014 demanded better auditing standards from Institute members following the discovery of ‚Ç¨235m black hole at Ireland's largest car insurer.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/central-bank-demands-better- auditing-standards-257059.html The Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board spotted a pattern of repeat poor performances by some firms in their statutory audits of clients but refused to name those who had received consecutively poor marks for the performance of audits. From June 2016, responsibility for the inspection of public interest entity audits such as those of banks and building societies will be transferred away from the Institute. Education, careers and advocacy From June to September each year, Chartered Accountants Ireland runs a student marketing campaign throughout the island of Ireland. In 2009, Chartered Accountants Ireland introduced a new route to Chartered Accountancy. Called 'The Elevation Programme', it was renamed Chartered Business Route, Flexible Option, in 2014.http://www.charteredaccountants.ie/en/General/News-and- Events/News1/2014/June/Student-recruitment--5-key-updates-for- the-201415-academic-year-/ The Chartered Business Route seeks to provide students with the option to study and sit exams while they remain in employment. Students enrolling via this programme do not need to undertake a training contract with a local firm. The qualification received on completion is equal to those achieved via a training contract. 15% of the institute's students chose this training route.http://www.charteredcareers.net/type_grad_working.php#grad_type In 2012, Chartered Accountants Ireland launched a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) initiative to encourage members to promote Ireland as a location for FDI business.Ulster Business, 31 August 2012, p.120http://www.charteredaccountants.ie/FDI References External links * Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland Category:Accounting in the United Kingdom Category:Professional associations based in the United Kingdom Category:Professional associations based in Ireland Category:1888 establishments in Ireland Category:Accounting in Ireland Category:Member bodies of the International Federation of Accountants ","title":"Chartered Accountants Ireland"},{"id":"5688404","text":"The Jolly Beggar, also known as The Gaberlunzieman, is Child ballad 279.

The game is particular in that it does not simply provide a top-down view to command one's army, but also allows the player to control units individually in third-person view. Plot Around 2200, the Empire on Earth sends colonists to space to seek resources for the now-depleted Earth. The first settlement is on Primus IV. Its colonists are applauded and praised for their bravery. The Empire then sets up colonies all over the galaxy. Suddenly, Primus IV is attacked by a reptilian race known only as the Mantai. Much of the colonist population is killed, but the Empire sends no help. The Empire forgets about Primus IV, as does the rest of the universe. After the colonists manage to fight off the Mantai to less inhabitable parts of the world, they begin to rebuild. Soon after, they discover a material known as SL-18. It is proven to be the perfect material to use in armor and metals: stronger than any other known material. Once the Empire back on Earth hears about this, they are eager to trade with the colonists. The colonists themselves are not so willing. They trade SL-18 with anyone who'll pay for it, but the Empire sees this open trade as a danger to the SL-18 supply for Earth and its colonies. Earth sets up an outpost on Primus IV to make sure that they have sole control of the SL-18 supply. Using the funds they obtain in selling SL-18, the colonists hire an experienced mercenary force, known as the WarMonkeys. They use these forces to retake Primus IV. The Empire is infuriated, and sends its own armies to reclaim the planet. Thus the war between the WarMonkeys and Imperial Forces begins.

The team consisted of Shawn Stasiak and Chuck Palumbo. They are former WCW World Tag Team Champions. Stasiak feuded with Curt Hennig and \\"stole\\" his \\"Perfect\\" gimmick while Palumbo feuded with Lex Luger and \\"stole\\" his \\"Total Package\\" gimmick. Although initially solo players, within a month of active duty on the WCW roster, they paired together, their team name being an amalgam of their then- nicknames 'PerfectShawn' and 'The Main Event', respectively. The team was also part of The Alliance stable months after WCW's closure in 2001. History = World Championship Wrestling = Formation (2000) Perfect Event formed in late May 2000 feuding with KroniK and defeated them in June 2000 for the WCW Tag Team Titles. Despite being very green in the ring, they were booked over established stars, won titles and enjoyed a constant push by way of Dusty Finishes. They feuded with Tony Marinara, M.I.A., KroniK and The Filthy Animals. The duo became known for using a Lex Flexer, Lex Luger's own custom dumbbell taken by Palumbo, as an illegal weapon in their matches. The Perfect Event grew a notoriety for hijacking the WCW production truck (similar to the nWo and D-Generation X) and blatantly messing with opponent's entrances. In August, Stasiak and Palumbo helped form The Natural Born Thrillers with Mike Sanders, Sean O'Haire, Mark Jindrak, and Reno. They were briefly \\"coached\\" by Kevin Nash. Johnny the Bull, a tag team partner of Palumbo later on in WWE, would also join the group following the formation.  Split and feud (2001)  Palumbo and Stasiak won the WCW Tag Team Championship two more times before splitting in early January 2001 when they won a tag team battle royal with Sean O'Haire and Mark Jindrak for a future tag team title shot. After the conclusion of the match Mike Sanders declared both teams victorious and that any combination of the four would face The Insiders (Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash). The Perfect Event split up when Palumbo and Sean O'Haire would be the two chosen members of the Natural Born Thrillers who would face and defeat Page and Nash for the tag titles at Sin on January 14, 2001. Palumbo and O'Haire continued to team together while Stasiak and Mark Jindrak also started teaming together. Following Palumbo and O'Haire's title victory, the Natural Born Thrillers broke up when the team of Shawn Stasiak and Mark Jindrak would become jealous of Palumbo and O'Haire. The teams would face each other at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, 2001, for the tag team titles, which Palumbo and O'Haire retained. =World Wrestling Federation= Following the acquisition of WCW's intellectual unit by the World Wrestling Federation in 2001, the duo of Palumbo and Stasiak were reunited on July 9, 2001 edition of Raw is War as part of Shane McMahon's The Alliance stable feuding with the WWF wrestlers until Palumbo defected to the WWF near the end of the storyline.

SMAD7 is a protein that, as its name describes, is a homolog of the Drosophila gene: \\"Mothers against decapentaplegic\\". It belongs to the SMAD family of proteins, which belong to the TGFŒ≤ superfamily of ligands. Like many other TGFŒ≤ family members, SMAD7 is involved in cell signalling. It is a TGFŒ≤ type 1 receptor antagonist. It blocks TGFŒ≤1 and activin associating with the receptor, blocking access to SMAD2. It is an inhibitory SMAD (I-SMAD) and is enhanced by SMURF2. Smad7 enhances muscle differentiation.  Structure  Smad proteins contain two conserved domains. The Mad Homology domain 1 (MH1 domain) is at the N-terminal and the Mad Homology domain 2 (MH2 domain) is at the C-terminal. Between them there is a linker region which is full of regulatory sites. The MH1 domain has DNA binding activity while the MH2 domain has transcriptional activity. The linker region contains important regulatory peptide motifs including potential phosphorylation sites for mitogen-activated protein kinases(MAPKs), Erk-family MAP kinases, the Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) and protein kinase C (PKC). Smad7 does not have the MH1 domain. A proline-tyrosine (PY) motif presents at its linker region enables its interaction with the WW domains of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, the Smad ubiquitination-related factors (Smurf2). It resides predominantly in the nucleus at basal state and translocates to the cytoplasm upon TGF-Œ≤ stimulation.  Function  SMAD7 inhibits TGF-Œ≤ signaling by preventing formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes which initiate the TGF-Œ≤ signaling. It interacts with activated TGF-Œ≤ type I receptor therefore block the association, phosphorylation and activation of Smad2. By occupying type I receptors for Activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), it also plays a role in negative feedback of these pathways. Upon TGF- Œ≤ treatment, Smad7 binds to discrete regions of Pellino-1 via distinct regions of the Smad MH2 domains. The interaction blocks the formation of the IRAK1-mediated IL-1R/TLR signaling complex therefore abrogates NF-Œ∫B activity, which subsequently causes reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes. While Smad7 is induced by TGF-Œ≤, it is also induced by other stimuli, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-Œ≥ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±. Therefore, it provides a cross-talk between TGF-Œ≤ signaling and other cellular signaling pathways.  Role in cancer  A mutation located in SMAD7 gene is a cause of susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) type 3. Perturbation of Smad7 and suppression of TGF-Œ≤ signaling was found to be evolved in CRC. Case control studies and meta-analysis in Asian and European populations also provided evidence that this mutation is associated with colorectal cancer risk. TGF-Œ≤ is one of the important growth factors in pancreatic cancer. By controlling the TGF-Œ≤ pathway, smad7 is believed to be related to this disease. Some previous study showed over-expression of Smad7 in pancreatic cells but there was a recent study showed a low Smad7 expression. The role of Smad7 in pancreatic cancer is still controversial. Over-expression or constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can promote tumor processes. EGF-induced MMP-9 expression enhances tumor invasion and metastasis in some kinds of tumor cells such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Smad7 exerts an inhibitory effect on the EGF signaling pathway. Therefore, it may play a role in prevention of cancer metastasis.  Use in Pharmacology  SMAD7 signaling has been studied in a recent Celgene Phase III trial, NCT ID number 94, which interacts with the SMAD7 pathway. This drug (Mongersen) was studied in patients with Crohn's disease.

It is one of three high schools in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City serving students in grades nine through 12. Founded in 1921, the school draws students from across the Salt Lake Valley and beyond. Judge Memorial shares its city location with Our Lady of Lourdes parish and school.  History  The school property was originally the John Judge Memorial Miner's Home, a hospital established by Mary Judge, wife of John Judge, a partner of US Senator Thomas Kearns in Park City's famous Silver King Mining Co. Kearns married Judge's niece, Jennie Judge. Judge Mercy Home, more commonly called Judge Miner's Home, was designed by architect David C. Dart. The hospital was established for the population of Catholic coal miners working in Park City who suffered from black lung. As the need for a hospital dedicated to this cause subsided in direct relation to the decline of coal mining east of Salt Lake, Mary Judge (who along with her deceased husband, John, was the benefactor of the hospital) expressed her wishes to the bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake to reopen the medical facility as a school. Mary Judge died before the diocese opened the new school's doors. The cornerstone was laid by Bishop Lawrence Scanlan in the fall of 1902 but the hospital was not opened until the fall of 1910. The hospital was originally intended to provide medical treatment for aged and infirm miners. Many miners working in Park City suffered from silicosis, also known as \\"miners' consumption\\", the disease that killed Mary's husband John at the age of 48.\\"JOHN AND MARY HARNEY JUDGE,\\" Utah History Encyclopedia With Holy Cross Hospital a few blocks away, the need for a miners' hospital was not great; it was remodeled and opened as a school in the fall of 1920, under the name \\"Cathedral School.\\" Until 1929 the school was known as Cathedral High School and Catholic Grammar School.

That fall, Bishop Joseph Lennox Federal brought in the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales to run it as an all-boys school. At this time, girls attended St. Mary of the Wasatch High School.Deseret News, May 30, 1964 In 1970, St. Mary closed and girls once again joined the boys at Judge. That same year, the school added the word \\"Catholic\\" to its name.  Student body  With a large service area, the school attracts students from throughout the Wasatch Front, from Ogden and Layton to Draper and Riverton, and from Park City and Jeremy Ranch to Magna and Tooele. More than 25 percent of the student body self- reports as being a minority. More than 62 percent of students attending Judge receive some sort of financial assistance.

A former editor was Cisca Dresselhuys, who retired in 2008; the current editor (2009) is Margriet van der Linden. The magazine calls itself the \\"only opinion magazine for women,\\" and considers itself a part of the women's movement.According to Cisca Dresselhus, in It is published on a monthly basis. The magazine currently contains articles about women and women's issues, as well as \\"lifestyle\\" sections. It also has a reputation for publishing stories about and studies of female sexuality in the Netherlands. For many years, Opzij was a yardstick to measure Dutch women's attitudes; for instance, a 2002 study investigated Dutch women's opinions on relationships and sexuality based largely on empirical evidence of the changes Opzij and its readership have experienced since its founding. The publisher and owner of the magazine was Weekbladpers.

He was attracted to politics in his teens, being drawn to the Labour Party by the famous miners' leader Anuerin Bevan. He attended Marshfield Primary School in Castelton, Bassaleg Grammar School and Cardiff College of Art, all in South Wales where he studied painting, drawing and sculpture. While he was in high school and college, Akerman became very active in archaeology, having participated in a dozen excavations in different parts of the principality. In 1964 Akerman was invited by the Canadian government to take the position of head of Archaeological Illustration at the Fortress of Louisbourg Restoration Project in Nova Scotia. While in Cape Breton He helped to organize fishermen in the Louisbourg area into an organization that eventually affiliated with the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union. In 1967 he was the New Democratic Party candidate in Cape Breton West but came third. Later that year he became a reporter, news reader and talk show host at CHER Radio in Sydney but was fired for attempting to unionize the staff. For this he was made a life member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. In 1968 Akerman ran as the NDP federal candidate in Cape Breton East Richmond, but again came third. Later than year he ran for the leadership of the provincial NDP and won by four votes over Professor Keith Jobson. Two years later, Akerman was elected to the legislature for the riding of Cape Breton East (Glace Bay). He was re-elected in 1974 and 1978. In 1980 he resigned both his seat and the party leadership to become head of Intergovernmental Affairs for Nova Scotia in the government of premier John M. Buchanan. Subsequently, he was appointed Executive Director and Secretary to the cabinet's Policy Board. He also held the positions Special Adviser to the Minister of the Environment and Manager of the Film Development Fund. In 1990, he was dismissed by the incoming premier Donald Cameron. In the 1980s, Akerman had also become active in community theatre, directing and/or appearing over 30productions, and was president of the Nova Scotia Drama League and Theatre Arts Guild. After he left the government in 1990, Akerman became editor of the Metro Weekly newspaper and turned his hand to film acting. The newspaper closed its doors after a few years, but Akerman's film career continued. As of January 2014, he has worked on 128 film shoots, 119 of them in leading, supporting or principal roles. He was acted with a long list of stars including Harrison Ford, Hilary Swank, Tom Selleck, Sissy Spacek, and Liam Neeson. Akerman is also a portrait and landscape painter, specializing in Welsh and Nova Scotia scenes, having exhibited in Halifax, Cape Breton and Lunenburg. In December 2013 Akerman formed XMLAS, an association for former Members of the Legislature and was elected its first president. He lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Political career In the provincial election of May 30, 1967, Akerman ran for the first time as an NDP candidate, in the constituency of Cape Breton West, and won 13 per cent of the vote. In the following year, he ran as the party's candidate in the federal election in Cape Breton‚ÄîEast Richmond, and won 7,750 votes. He placed third, but in Glace Bay, Akerman won three wards out of six. He decided to run in the Glace Bay provincial constituency in the next provincial election. Later in 1968, the NDP held a convention at Sydney, at which Akerman sought the party's provincial leadership. He was opposed by law professor Keith Jobson of Halifax, who was backed by outgoing leader James H. Aitchison, and won the contest by four votes becoming party leader at the age of 26.Canadian Press, \\"Void facing N.S. New Democrats...\\", Globe and Mail, May 19, 1980 The next provincial election was held October 13, 1970. Akerman was elected in Glace Bay with a majority of 1,527 votes. Sydney school teacher Paul MacEwan was also elected, so the party held two seats in the Legislature until 1974. In the vote held April 2, 1974, Akerman and MacEwan were both re-elected, along with a third candidate, James 'Buddy' MacEachern, who ran in Cape Breton Centre, a riding sandwiched between Akerman's seat and MacEwan's. And in the following provincial election, held September 19, 1978, these three were re- elected, and Len Arsenault won in the constituency of Cape Breton North, thus bringing the NDP presence in the Nova Scotia Legislature up to four seats. During his years as head of the NDP in Nova Scotia, Akerman had met increased resistance to his efforts from the Halifax branch of the party which was critical of the party's inability to win seats on the mainland. Through gaining a majority of seats on the party's provincial executive, the Halifax group came to dominate the party, even although they were unable win a seat in the Legislature. Akerman also faced strains on his health and personal life, due to the stress of the workload he carried; he missed the 1977 session of the House because of an illness and his marriage ended in divorce. By 1980, reportedly tired after 12 years at the helm of the party, he announced his retirement. At the time he was the longest-serving NDP leader anywhere in Canada. Soon afterwards, Akerman received a contract from the provincial government to become executive director of intergovernmental affairs. In order to accept a job in the civil service he severed his ties with the NDP.\\"Woman elected to lead NDP in Nova Scotia,\\" Globe and Mail, November 17, 1980 He worked in this position or other provincial government posts for the next eleven years. Following this, he served for a time as editor of the Metro Telecaster, then pursued a career in acting. He has appeared in at least 24 movies, including Cloudburst, Hobo with a Shotgun and Blackbird. During his time as NDP leader in Nova Scotia, Akerman earned a high level of respect from all political parties and was considered one of the ablest debaters in the House. Akerman attempted a return to politics in a March 6, 2001 byelection in the provincial constituency of Halifax Fairview. This time running as candidate for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, Akerman finished second behind NDP candidate Graham Steele.

McLeod and starring Danny Kaye, Virginia Mayo, Vera-Ellen, Steve Cochran, Walter Abel, Eve Arden, and Fay Bainter. Virginia Mayo's and Vera- Ellen's singing voices were dubbed by Betty Russell and Dorothy Ellers, respectively.Despite modern awareness of these uncredited singers, even some professional authors continue to ascribe singing to the actors, e.g. \\"capitalized on the stylized vocals of the radiant Virginia Mayo\\", in Frederick V. Romano, The Boxing Filmography: American Features, 1920-2003 (Jefferson NC: McFarland, 2004), 108; Produced by Samuel Goldwyn, it is a remake of the Harold Lloyd film The Milky Way (1936) about a milkman who becomes world boxing champion. Lionel Stander plays the role of \\"Spider\\" Schultz in both versions of the movie. Plot Well-meaning and mild-mannered milkman Burleigh Sullivan (Kaye) meets Polly Pringle (Mayo), a beautiful, but out-of-work, singer, whilst on his rounds early in the morning. He tries to get her a job at the club where his sister Susie (Vera-Ellen) is performing, but gets the sack for his trouble. Whilst meeting Susie after the show, he sees her being molested by drunken boxer 'Speed' McFarlane and his bodyguard 'Spider'. In the fracas, Speed is knocked out and his manager, Gabby Sloan, is furious. The newspapers pick up the story and photographers catch Burleigh 'knocking out' Speed again. In fact, as before, Speed is accidentally knocked out by Spider as a result of Sullivan's quick foot-work and propensity for ducking. Gabby decides to turn Burleigh into a fighter to turn the publicity to his advantage. Burleigh goes on tour, but doesn't realize that all his fights have been fixed and his opponents have been asked to 'take a dive' to build up his image. He comes to think that he really is a great fighter, and develops a swollen head. Polly and Susie are not pleased with the turn of events. Meanwhile, Speed and Susie have become an item themselves. Burleigh's contract is bought by Mr Austin, his former boss at Sunflower Milk, for $50,000, and he is set up to fight Speed for a charity fundraiser organised by socialite Mrs. E. Winthrop LeMoyne. Speed has accidentally been given an overdose of sleeping tablets and falls asleep during the fight, so Burleigh wins by default. Burleigh is reluctant to retire without having been KO'd, but Mrs. LeMoyne accidentally does just that. Now Burleigh can retire with a clear conscience. As promised by Mr Austin, he is given a partnership in the dairy company, with his former rival and new friend, Speed, as one of the district managers. But Gabby and Spider wind up working as milkmen.

Work Grossberg's work in the past few years has revolved around the classification theory of non-elementary classes. In particular, he has provided, in joint work with Monica VanDieren, a proof of an upward \\"Morley's Categoricity Theorem\\" (a version of Shelah's categoricity conjecture) for Abstract Elementary Classes with the amalgamation property, that are tame. In another work with VanDieren, they also initiated the study of tame Abstract Elementary Classes. Tameness is both a crucial technical property in categoricity transfer proofs and an independent notion of interest in the area ‚Äì it has been studied by Baldwin, Hyttinen, Lessmann, Kes√§l√§, Kolesnikov, Kueker among others. Other results include a best approximation to the main gap conjecture for AECs (with Olivier Lessmann), identifying AECs with JEP, AP, no maximal models and tameness as the uncountable analog to Fra√Øss√©'s constructions (with VanDieren), a stability spectrum theorem and the existence of Morley sequences for those classes (also with VanDieren). In addition to this work on the Categoricity Conjecture, more recently, with Boney and Vasey, new understanding of frames in AECs and forking (in the abstract elementary class setting) has been obtained. Some of Grossberg's work may be understood as part of the big project on Saharon Shelah's outstanding categoricity conjectures: Conjecture 1. (Categoricity for \\\\mathit{L}_{{\\\\omega_1},\\\\omega}). Let \\\\psi be a sentence. If \\\\psi is categorical in a cardinal \\\\; >\\\\beth_{\\\\omega_{1}} then \\\\psi is categorical in all cardinals \\\\; >\\\\beth_{\\\\omega_{1}}. See Infinitary logic and Beth number. Conjecture 2. (Categoricity for AECs) See and . Let K be an AEC. There exists a cardinal Œº(K) such that categoricity in a cardinal greater than Œº(K) implies categoricity in all cardinals greater than Œº(K). Furthermore, Œº(K) is the Hanf number of K. Other examples of his results in pure model theory include: generalizing the Keisler‚ÄìShelah omitting types theorem for \\\\mathit{L(Q)} to successors of singular cardinals; with Shelah, introducing the notion of unsuper-stability for infinitary logics, and proving a nonstructure theorem, which is used to resolve a problem of Fuchs and Salce in the theory of modules; with Hart, proving a structure theorem for \\\\mathit{L}_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega}, which resolves Morley's conjecture for excellent classes; and the notion of relative saturation and its connection to Shelah's conjecture for \\\\mathit{L}_{\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega}. Examples of his results in applications to algebra include the finding that under the weak continuum hypothesis there is no universal object in the class of uncountable locally finite groups (answering a question of Macintyre and Shelah); with Shelah, showing that there is a jump in cardinality of the abelian group Extp(G, Z) at the first singular strong limit cardinal. Personal life Grossberg married his former doctoral student and frequent collaborator, Monica VanDieren.

A priest is In persona Christi, because he acts as Christ and as God. An extended term, In persona Christi capitis, ‚Äúin the person of Christ the head,‚Äù was introduced in by the bishops of the Vatican Council II in the Decree on the Ministry and Live of Priests, Presbyterorum Ordinis, December 7, 1965.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1548, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Citta del Vaticano 1993 Roman Catholic understanding In Roman Catholicism, the priest acts in the person of Christ in pronouncing the words that comprise part of a sacramental rite. For example, in the Mass, the Words of Institution, by which the bread becomes the Body of Christ and the wine becomes the Precious Blood. The priest and bishop act in the person of Christ the head in their leadership of the Church. Recent history ;Pope Pius XII (1947)Pius XII, Mediator Dei, Encyclical, 1947. :40. Only to the apostles, and thenceforth to those on whom their successors have imposed hands, is granted the power of the priesthood, in virtue of which they represent the person of Jesus Christ before their people, acting at the same time as representatives of their people before God‚Ä¶. :68. The august sacrifice of the altar, then, is no mere empty commemoration of the passion and death of Jesus Christ, but a true and proper act of sacrifice, whereby the High Priest by an unbloody immolation offers Himself a most acceptable victim to the Eternal Father, as He did upon the cross. ‚ÄúIt is one and the same victim; the same person now offers it by the ministry of His priests, who then offered Himself on the cross, the manner of offering alone being different.‚Äù :69. The priest is the same, Jesus Christ, whose sacred Person His minister represents. Now the minister, by reason of the sacerdotal consecration which he has received, is made like to the High Priest and possesses the power of performing actions in virtue of Christ's very person. ;Bishops of Vatican Council II (1964)Vatican Council II, Lumen gentium, 1964. :28. ‚Ä¶ Priests, although they do not possess the highest degree of the priesthood, and although they are dependent on the bishops in the exercise of their power, nevertheless they are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity. By the power of the sacrament of Orders, in the image of Christ the eternal high Priest, they are consecrated to preach the Gospel and shepherd the faithful and to celebrate divine worship, so that they are true priests of the New Testament. Partakers of the function of Christ the sole Mediator, on their level of ministry, they announce the divine word to all. They exercise their sacred function especially in the eucharistic worship or the celebration of the Mass by which acting in the person of Christ‚Ä¶ :29. At a lower level of the hierarchy are deacons, upon whom hands are imposed ‚Äúnot unto the priesthood, but unto a ministry of service‚Äù. ;Pope Paul VI (1967)Paul VI, Sacerdotalis Caelibatus, Encyclical, 1967. :29. ‚Ä¶ acting in the person of Christ, the priest unites himself most intimately with the offering, and places on the altar his entire life, which bears the marks of the holocaust. ;Pope John Paul II (1980)John Paul II, Dominicae Cenae, Apostolic Exhortation, 1980. :8. The priest offers the holy Sacrifice in persona Christi‚Ä¶ Awareness of this reality throws a certain light on the character and significance of the priest celebrant who, by confecting the holy Sacrifice and acting ‚Äúin persona Christi,‚Äù is sacramentally (and ineffably) brought into that most profound sacredness, and made part of it, spiritually linking with it in turn all those participating in the eucharistic assembly. ;Typical Version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997)Holy See, Catechism of the Catholic Church (Second, ‚ÄúDefinitive‚Äù Edition), 1997. :875: ‚Ä¶ No one can bestow grace on himself; it must be given and offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and empowered by Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the mission and faculty (‚Äúthe sacred power‚Äù) to act in persona Christi Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the people of God in the diaconia of liturgy, word, and charity, in communion with the bishop and his presbyterate. The ministry in which Christ's emissaries do and give by God's grace what they cannot do and give by their own powers, is called a ‚Äúsacrament‚Äù by the Church's tradition. Indeed, the ministry of the Church is conferred by a special sacrament.‚Äù ;Pope Benedict XVI (2007)CWNews: Benedict XVI, ‚ÄúAt Chrism Mass, Pope reflects on priest's vestments‚Äù Apr. 5, 2007 :Celebrating the Chrism Mass on Holy Thursday with the priests of Rome, Pope Benedict XVI said that priests should prepare themselves thoroughly to celebrate Mass and administer the sacraments, remembering that they act in the person of Christ. ;Code of Canon Law (1983)Holy See, Code of Canon Law, 1983 as modified by Benedict XVI (2009)Benedict XVI, Motu Proprio, Omnium In Mentem, 2009. :Can. 1008 By divine institution, some of the Christian faithful are marked with an indelible character and constituted as sacred ministers by the sacrament of holy orders. They are thus consecrated and deputed such that each, according to his own grade, may serve the People of God by a new and specific title. :Can. 1009 ::¬ß1. The orders are the episcopate, the presbyterate, and the diaconate. ::¬ß2. They are conferred by the imposition of hands and the consecratory prayer which the liturgical books prescribe for the individual grades. ::¬ß3. Those who are constituted in the order of the episcopate or the presbyterate receive the mission and capacity to act in the person of Christ the Head, whereas deacons are empowered to serve the People of God in the ministries of the liturgy, the word and charity. The change in Canon Law introduced by Omnium in Mentem resolved a discrepancy between the applicability of in persona Christi Capitis (‚Äúin the person of Christ the Head‚Äù) to deacons as well as priests and bishops. With the new Motu Proprio, in persona Christi Capitis applies only to priests and bishops.  Liturgical significance  The doctrine of In persona Christi affects liturgical practice. When a priest speaks to the congregation In persona Christi, the words they speak are the words of God to the Church, rather than the words of humans to God.
