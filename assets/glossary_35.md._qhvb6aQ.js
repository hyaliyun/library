A former graphic design consultant, he began his stand-up comedy career in 2003 and by the end of 2004 was a finalist for three major UK comedy newcomer awards: So You Think You're Funny, BBC New Comedy Awards and the Chortle Student Comedian of the Year. While attending University College Dublin, he was auditor of the Literary and Historical Society. Shortly after this he began writing sketches, and material for other comedians and TV shows and established himself as a regular face on the Irish stand-up comedy circuit. Regan has produced five one man shows for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, publishing 2 illustrated books, appearing as a regular contributor on radio and television while also performing at comedy festivals worldwide, he is recognised as the leader of a new generation of talented comics emerging from Ireland. Stand-up Shows Regan began stand-up in the early 2000's. In 2006, he performed as part of the first ever Irish gala at Montreal Just for Laughs. Regan's shows have included 2007's Edinburgh Fringe show \\"Nobody Knows... Jarlath Regan\\", 2018/19's \\"Organ Freeman\\", which chronicled his experience as a live-organ donor, and 2019/2020's \\"Notion's Eleven\\" which has been recorded in Vicar Street, for DVD release in late 2020. Television work Regan wrote and performed sketches on Scope (2007), an Irish science television programme for teenagers and was a regular panellist during the 2008‚Äì2009 season of The Panel. In 2010, Regan co-presented The Rumour Room, a teen entertainment series part of TRT√â on RT√â Two television. Some highlights from the series included his interview with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, a series of comedy sketches in which Regan beat toddlers at physical tests of strength and an in- studio game called \\"The ‚Ç¨21 Challenge\\" in which Regan forced a child to gamble their pocket money in an unusual game of blackjack. An Irishman Abroad In 2013, Regan began An Irishman Abroad, a series of weekly podcasts interviewing Irish people and people of Irish descent about their lives and gaining insights into the experiences of Irish people abroad, both successes and failures. It won the iTunes Store's award for \\"Best New Audio Podcast\\" for 2013. Most of the guests of the more than 350 episodes have been celebrities from the worlds of comedy (Dara √ì Briain, Jason Byrne, Graham Linehan), sport (Sonia O'Sullivan, Richard Hughes), as well as film and television (Jack Reynor, Aidan Gillen, Paul Mescal). Some of the guests are successful but not particularly famous, but have a story to tell. In 2014, The Daily Telegraph included the podcast among the \\"best comedy podcasts\\", and Niall Byrne of the Irish Independent included it in a list of \\"world's greatest podcasts\\". In 2017, Diaspora website IrishCentral.com described the podcast as \\"some of the best conversations with Irish people you'll ever hear\\". Pat Carty of Hot Press attributes this success to the non-reliance on a \\"parade of famous faces\\". In 2020, Stevie Gallacher of The Sunday Post described the podcast as proof that the Irish have the \\"gift of the gab\\". In 2014, Paul Campbell of The Guardian's \\"Talking Sport\\" blog wrote of the Jerry Flannery edition that \\"every single young person reading this should go download this podcast and listen to it every week for the rest of time\\". A justice-themed spin-off series Irishman:Behind Bars was launched in 2019, while a basketball-themed spin-off series, Inside Basketball and US politics-themed series, Irishman In America, were launched in 2020. The podcast moved to Patreon in August 2020.

He was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, on March 1, 1727, to Christopher and Mary Nixon. In 1755 he served in the Massachusetts militia during Sir William Johnson's campaign against the French during the French and Indian War. In 1775 Nixon had moved to Sudbury, Massachusetts, and was a captain of the town's Minutemen whom he led at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He and his men fought at Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, his unit was one of the last to leave the field. After the battle Nixon was promoted to colonel of the 6th Massachusetts Regiment. Col. Nixon's regiment was placed into Gen. John Sullivan's brigade and took part in the New York and New Jersey campaign during 1776. In August 1776, Nixon was promoted to brigadier general, and he commanded a brigade consisting of the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th, and 8th Massachusetts Regiments. He led his brigade in the Battle of Harlem Heights and later in the Saratoga Campaign, when it was reinforced by Cogswell's, Gage's and Mays's regiments of Militia. Nixon's brigade was involved in the Battle of Bemis Heights in October 1777, and took part in the final assault; during this attack a cannonball passed so close to his head that his sight and hearing were affected the rest of his life. Nixon resigned his commission September 12, 1780. General John Nixon moved to Weybridge, Vermont in 1806 and died while visiting his son in Middlebury on March 24, 1815. He was buried at a cemetery on his farm, which was later incorporated into what is now First Weybridge Hill Cemetery. Family On February 7, 1754, John Nixon married Thankful Berry (1735-1776), also of Framingham. In 1778 he married Hannah Gleason (1744-1831), the widow of Capt Micajah Gleason, who was killed at the Battle of White Plains in 1776. General John Nixon Elementary School in Sudbury, Massachusetts, is named in his honor, as is Nixon Road in Framingham, Massachusetts. On Nobscot Hill in Framingham there is a trail named after him which leads to the ruins of his house site. References *Fisher, Maj. Gen.

The stem cells are then extracted from the blood and transplanted back to the patient. The drug was developed by AnorMED, which was subsequently bought by Genzyme. Medical uses Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, which is important as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation, is generally performed using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but is ineffective in around 15 to 20% of patients. Combination of G-CSF with plerixafor increases the percentage of persons that respond to the therapy and produce enough stem cells for transplantation. The drug is approved for patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Contraindications =Pregnancy and lactation= Studies in pregnant animals have shown teratogenic effects. Plerixafor is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women except in critical cases. Fertile women are required to use contraception. It is not known whether the drug is secreted into the breast milk. Breast feeding should be discontinued during therapy. Adverse effects Nausea, diarrhea and local reactions were observed in over 10% of patients. Other problems with digestion and general symptoms like dizziness, headache, and muscular pain are also relatively common; they were found in more than 1% of patients. Allergies occur in less than 1% of cases. Most adverse effects in clinical trials were mild and transient. The European Medicines Agency has listed a number of safety concerns to be evaluated on a post-marketing basis, most notably the theoretical possibilities of spleen rupture and tumor cell mobilisation. The first concern has been raised because splenomegaly was observed in animal studies, and G-CSF can cause spleen rupture in rare cases. Mobilisation of tumor cells has occurred in patients with leukaemia treated with plerixafor. Interactions No interaction studies have been conducted. The fact that plerixafor does not interact with the cytochrome system indicates a low potential for interactions with other drugs. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= In the form of its zinc complex, plerixafor acts as an antagonist (or perhaps more accurately a partial agonist) of the alpha chemokine receptor CXCR4 and an allosteric agonist of CXCR7. The CXCR4 alpha-chemokine receptor and one of its ligands, SDF-1, are important in hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. The in vivo effect of plerixafor with regard to ubiquitin, the alternative endogenous ligand of CXCR4, is unknown. Plerixafor has been found to be a strong inducer of mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to the bloodstream as peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally, plerixafor inhibits CD20 expression on B cells by interfering with CXCR4/SDF1 axis that regulates its expression. =Pharmacokinetics= Following subcutaneous injection, plerixafor is absorbed quickly and peak concentrations are reached after 30 to 60 minutes. Up to 58% are bound to plasma proteins, the rest mostly resides in extravascular compartments. The drug is not metabolized in significant amounts; no interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzymes or P-glycoproteins has been found. Plasma half life is 3 to 5 hours. Plerixafor is excreted via the kidneys, with 70% of the drug being excreted within 24 hours. Chemistry Plerixafor is a macrocyclic compound and a bicyclam derivative, the cyclam rings being linked at the amine nitrogen atoms by a 1,4-xylyl spacer. It is a strong base; all eight nitrogen atoms accept protons readily. The two macrocyclic rings form chelate complexes with bivalent metal ions, especially zinc, copper and nickel, as well as cobalt and rhodium. The biologically active form of plerixafor is its zinc complex. =Synthesis= Three of the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) are protected with tosyl groups. The product is treated with 1,4-bis(brommethyl)benzene and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile. After cleaving of the tosyl groups with hydrobromic acid, plerixafor octahydrobromide is obtained. History The molecule was first synthesised in 1987 to carry out basic studies on the redox chemistry of dimetallic coordination compounds. Then, it was serendipitously discovered by another chemist that such a molecule could have a potential use in the treatment of HIV because of its role in the blocking of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor which acts as a co-receptor for certain strains of HIV (along with the virus's main cellular receptor, CD4). Development of this indication was terminated because of lacking oral availability and cardiac disturbances. Further studies led to the new indication for cancer patients. Society and culture Plerixafor has orphan drug status in the United States and European Union for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication on 15 December 2008. In the European Union, the drug was approved after a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use assessment report on 29 May 2009. The drug was approved for use in Canada by Health Canada on 8 December 2011.Notice of Compliance information Research =Anti-cancer properties= Plerixafor was seen to reduce metastasis in mice in several studies. It has also been shown to reduce recurrence of glioblastoma in a mouse model after radiotherapy. In this model, the cancer cells that survived radiation critically depended on bone marrow derived cells for vasculogenesis, and the recruitment of the latter was mediated by SDF-1 CXCR4 interactions, which are blocked by plerixafor. =Use in stem cell research= Researchers at Imperial College have demonstrated that plerixafor in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can mobilise mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells into the peripheral blood of mice. In double‚Äêblind, randomized, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trial, stem cell mobilization with plerixafor did not improve healing of ischemic diabetic woundsBonora BM, Cappellari R, Mazzucato M, et al., (2020). Stem cell mobilization with plerixafor and healing of diabetic ischemic wounds: A phase IIa , randomized, double‚Äêblind , placebo‚Äêcontrolled trial. STEM CELLS Translational Medicine, . =Neurologic= Blockade of CXCR4 signalling by plerixafor has also unexpectedly been found to be effective at counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia produced by chronic treatment with morphine, though only animal studies have been conducted as yet.

Although a member of the UNAFEC party selected by Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga, he failed to appear at the opening of the new Government, and never claimed his office. As a result, Kasongo Ilunga is now considered by the local media and the international community to have been an imaginary person, most likely created by Kisimba Ngoy, leader of the UNAFEC party, as a part of a plan to win the lucrative role for himself.

The only two candidates put forward for the Foreign Trade post were Kasongo Ilunga and Kisimba Ngoy, with the list being compiled by Kisimba himself. However, Kisimba had been a vocal supporter of Mobutu Sese Seko, someone whom Antoine Gizenga had once strongly opposed, likely causing him to choose the unknown Ilunga over Kisimba. Kisimba denied these charges, claiming that Ilunga later declined the role for personal reasons, and that he had sent a signed letter to the Prime Minister tendering his resignation.

It relies on phase variance, just like stereophonic sound. The sound characteristics of holophonics are most clearly heard through headphones, though they can be effectively demonstrated with two-channel stereo speakers, provided that they are phase-coherent. The word \\"holophonics\\" is related to \\"acoustic hologram\\". History Holophonics was created by Argentine inventor Hugo Zuccarelli in 1980, during his studies at the Politecnico di Milano university. In 1983, Zuccarelli released a recording entitled Zuccarelli Holophonics (The Matchbox Shaker) in the United Kingdom (UK) that was produced by CBS. The recording consisted entirely of short recordings of sounds designed to show off the Holophonics system. These included a shaking matchbox, haircut and blower, bees, balloon, plastic bag, birds, airplanes, fireworks, thunder and racing cars. In its early years, Holophonics was used by various artists, including Pink Floyd for The Final Cut, Roger Waters solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and Psychic TV's Dreams Less Sweet. The system has been used in film soundtracks, popular music, television and theme parks. Zuccarelli states that the human auditory system is a sound emitter, producing a reference sound that combines with incoming sound to form an interference pattern inside the ear. The nature of this pattern is sensitive to the direction of the incoming sound. According to the hypothesis, the cochlea detects and analyzes this pattern as if it were an acoustic hologram. The brain then interprets this data and infers the direction of the sound. An article from Zuccarelli presenting this theory was printed in the magazine New Scientist in 1983. This article was soon followed by two letters, casting doubt on Zuccarelli's theory and his scientific abilities.Zuccarelli, Hugo; \\"Ears Hear by Making Sounds,\\" New Scientist, 438‚Äì440 1983Baxter, A.J., and Kemp, David T.; \\"Zuccarelli's Theory,\\" New Scientist, 606-606 1983 To date, there has been no evidence provided that any acoustic emissions are used for sound localization. Holophonics, like binaural recording, instead reproduces the interaural differences (arrival time and amplitude between the ears), as well as rudimentary head-related transfer functions (HRTF). These create the illusion that sounds produced in the membrane of a speaker emanate from specific directions. Otoacoustic emissions While otoacoustic emissions do exist, there is no evidence to support the assertion that these play a role in sound localization, nor is any mechanism for this \\"interference\\" effect claimed by Zuccarelli supported. On the contrary, there is abundant literature proving that properly presented spatial cues via HRTF synthesis (mimicking binaural heads) or binaural recording is adequate to reproduce realistic spatial recordings comparable to real listening, and comparable to the Holophonics demonstrations.Gilkey & Anderson, \\"Binaural and Spatial Hearing in Real and Virtual Environments\\" Recordings released using holophonics * Pink Floyd, \\"The Final Cut\\" Harvest/E.M.I, 7243 8 31242 2 0 (1982). * Paul McCartney, \\"Keep Under Cover\\", 1983. * Roger Waters, \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\", Harvest, CDP 7 46029 2 (1984). * Psychic TV, \\"Dreams Less Sweet\\", Some Bizzare (1983).

Dr. Laurence F. Renehan. Rev. Dr Laurence F. Renehan (1797‚Äì1857) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth in County Kildare from 1845 to 1857. (St. Patrick's College is now formally the Pontifical University and National Seminary of Ireland, but is better known simply as Maynooth College. As such, it shares a campus and works in close cooperation with the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.) Biography He was born in 1797 at Longford Pass in the parish of Gurtnahoe, Tipperary. He was educated first at Freshfield, and afterwards at Kilkenny. In September 1819 he entered Maynooth College as a student for the Archdiocese of Cashel to study logic, and in 1825 was elected a Dunboyne student. On 15 September of the same year he was appointed junior dean, and a few weeks later was ordained priest. On 27 July 1827 he was elected professor of scripture, and he held this chair till June 1834, when he reluctantly accepted the post of vice- president. From 4 June 1841 to 24 June 1843 he also filled the office of bursar, and succeeded in extricating the college from financial difficulties. In 1845, on the resignation of the Very Rev. Michael Montague, Renehan became president of Maynooth, retaining the position until his death on 27 July 1857. Renehan was succeeded at St. Patrick's by Charles William Russell. Legacy Renehan commissioned the architect Augustus Pugin, a friend, to build the elaborate and beautiful buildings (\\"St. Mary's Square\\") that still dominate the South Campus at Maynooth. Among these is the Russell Library. A large meeting-room at Maynooth is named in Renehan's honor. He lies buried in a small cemetery on the campus. Works Renehan was closely associated with the Irish historian and antiquarian John O'Donovan (1803-1861). A massive volume upon which Renehan had labored for years, Collections on Irish Church History, Vol. 1: Irish Archbishops, received editing after his death by his colleague Daniel McCarthy and was published 1861 by C.M. Warren and Thomas Richardson, Dublin. This book remains a much-cited reference. Renehan was also a historian of the development of Catholicism in Ireland.Some figures from the past, Maynooth College website, accessed 22 August 2007 Renehan's extensive private collection of early Irish Church manuscripts constitutes 79 volumes of material currently housed in Maynooth's Russell Library. He was the author of Requiem Office and a Choir Manual of Sacred Music, in addition to a short History of Music.

He is referred to as the \\"founding father\\" of the professional advocation of historic preservation, the \\"godfather of preservation,\\" and an \\"extraordinary preservationist\\" who made important contributions to the knowledge of early American building practices, helped create the profession of the preservation architect, and passionately advocated for the retention and restoration of the American built heritage. According to Jacques Dalibard, a professor at McGill University School of Architecture, \\"with James Marston Fitch,James Marston Fitch created the historic preservation program at Columbia University in the 1960s. I cannot think of two people who had more influence on historic preservation in North America.\\" During his long career, Peterson received numerous awards for his service including the National Trust for Historic Preservation‚Äôs Louise du Pont Crowninshield Award (1966) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) medal for \\"vision and determination\\" (1979) and the Presidential Citation (1990). The AIA inducted him into the College of Fellows in 1962. Early career Peterson was raised in Madison, Minnesota, and received his bachelor's degree in architecture in the early 1920s from the University of Minnesota. In 1929, he began a thirty-three year tenure with the National Park Service. In 1931, his efforts were instrumental in saving the Moore House, the site of the British surrender, in Yorktown, Virginia. While documenting this building, Peterson created the prototype for the historic structure report, the basic format of which is still in use. Peterson is perhaps best remembered for establishing the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), a federal documentation program that is still active and which has spawned the Historic American Engineering Record and the Historic American Landscape Survey. On November 13, 1933, while he was the Chief of the Eastern Division for the National Park Service, Peterson wrote a memo to the director which became the charter for the program and successfully garnered funds from the Civil Works Administration the following month. HABS targeted unemployed architects, draftsmen, and photographers to make as complete a record as possible of \\"the rapidly disappearing examples of early architecture and historic structures throughout the country.\\" This program was credited as \\"the first major step upon the part of the Federal Government toward the cataloging and preservation of historic structures.\\" The first HABS survey work began in January 1934 and later that year was formalized as a joint agreement with the American Institute of Architects and the Library of Congress. The HABS program has continued nearly unabated to the present.The HABS project was discontinued during World War II and restarted in the late 1950s. During his life, Peterson constantly advocated for HABS, and was instrumental in restarting the program in 1957 and later saved it from oblivion when the Reagan administration threatened to pull funding. The end result was a stronger program with greatly increased funding. Early Philadelphia era Peterson and NPS historian Roy E. Appelman were assigned to Philadelphia in early 1947 to advise the Philadelphia National Shrines Park Commission on the national park being proposed for the area surrounding Independence Hall. Peterson was the uncredited primary author and editor of the Shrines Commission's 7-volume final report to Congress (December 1947), which was incorporated into the enabling legislation under which Independence National Historical Park was created. Peterson returned to Philadelphia in the early 1950s to work at INHP. While there, he helped restore Carpenters' Hall and re-create Library Hall, and directed much of the preservation-related activity of the National Park Service in the region. It was in this era that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania demolished all the 19th- and early 20th- century buildings on the 3 blocks north of Independence Hall, to create an open European-style mall. (Independence Mall remained a state park until 1974.) Peterson oversaw the moving of the Free Quaker Meetinghouse, the only building spared in the creation of the Mall, to accommodate the widening of 5th Street. He opposed the demolition of important 19th-century buildings within INHP, but did not prevail. He retired from the National Park Service in 1962, but continued to live and work from his row house located on Spruce Street. During Peterson's tenure at the National Park Service, he educated numerous students about historic preservation. In the 1950s, Philadelphia was in decline and the oldest neighborhoods, dating to the 18th century, were being abandoned and left to decay. It was in such a place that Peterson decided to purchase two row homes in 1954, one of which became his home. The area, which is now known as \\"Society Hill,\\" is today one of the most desirable areas to live in Philadelphia. Peterson not only helped name the area, but his tireless preservation advocacy secured the revitalization of Society Hill by motivating his friends and acquaintances to buy property there. Career highlights The 1960s were an extremely productive time for Peterson. He contributed to many scholarly conferences, including the Second International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historical Monuments in Venice in 1964. It was at this conference that the enormously influential Venice Charter was created, which established much of preservation philosophy that exists to this day and has become ingrained in the National Park Service's Secretary of the Interior's Standards for preservation. Peterson, along with the entire U.S. delegation rejected the charter, however, due to its European focus and the radical emphasis on preservation instead of restoration. In the 1960s, restoration‚Äîdefined as the \\"scraping\\" of later layers of historic fabric in order to restore the appearance of a building to an arbitrary date‚Äîwas the status quo and represented the majority of preservation work in the United States. The Venice Charter was a radical shift in preservation philosophy that would not become fully accepted in the United States until the 1980s. Peterson also served on the Committee on Principles and Guidelines for Historic Preservation established by the National Trust which helped influence the future direction of the preservation movement. In the mid-1960s, Peterson was appointed as an adjunct professor to the fledgling historic preservation program at Columbia University where he taught early-American building technology. He worked closely with James Marston Fitch to build this program into the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the country. Columbia's program became the model which spawned the tens of graduate and undergraduate programs in historic preservation that now exist across the United States. In 1970, Peterson established the European Traveling Summer School for Restorationists that allowed architects to view and participate in restoration projects outside the United States. Peterson was a founding member of the Association for Preservation Technology International (APT), which was created in 1968 in an effort to provide better education for the restoration, documentation, and preservation of historic buildings. He became the organization's first president in 1969. APT was enormously influential as it represented the first scholarly outlet for the activities of historic preservation. Peterson's activities through APT helped move preservation from an antiquarian hobby to a professional endeavor. Throughout his career, Peterson was an avid researcher on the history of American building technology. He is best known for his work on Robert Smith, a colonial-era architect which culminated in the publication of his book Robert Smith (1722-1777): Architect, Builder and Patriot by The Athenaeum of Philadelphia and the Carpenters' Company of Philadelphia in 2000. Other topics that Peterson covered included the early architecture of the Mississippi River valley, the use of iron in roofs, the development of the I-beam, and the recovery of the \\"lost\\" history of cement and concrete construction.Representative examples include: \\"Early Ste. Genevieve and Its Architecture,\\" Missouri Historical Review 25, no. 2 (1941); \\"Iron in Early American Roofs,\\" Smithsonian Journal of History (1968); \\"Inventing the I-Beam: Richard Turner, Cooper and Hewitt and Others,\\" APT Bulletin 12, no. 4 (1980). In 1983, Peterson established the Charles E. Peterson Prize to be awarded to students displaying superior drawing abilities in documenting HABS buildings. Managed by The Athenaeum of Philadelphia, the prize is awarded by HABS, the Athenaeum, and the AIA. He also donated all of his research papers and books to the University of Maryland in 1998, having in 1981 endowed a substantial fund to support scholarly research in American Architecture prior to 1860 at The Athenaeum of Philadelphia and gifted his Archive and Library of Early American Building Technology and Historic Preservation. Peterson is credited as an architect of Colonial National Historical Park, Jamestown and Yorktown, Virginia, listed on the National Register of Historic Places Creation of the profession of the preservation architect According to many contemporary preservation architects, Peterson \\"almost singlehandedly invented and developed the profession of historical architect.\\" In a similar vein he is considered to be \\"the father of modern restoration techniques.\\" From his start with the National Park Service in the 1930s, Peterson continually advocated for training of architects in the proper restoration of buildings that respected their history, technology, and authenticity. A continual theme of his was the inadequacy of most architects‚Äô work on historic buildings: > The shortcomings of architects in the field of historical restoration began > long ago. It became clear, even in the days of Latrobe, that the most > talented designers could not always be trusted around important landmarks. > ... Some of our most stylish architects have proposed‚Äîand have carried > out‚Äîgruesome butcheries on historic buildings. ... The architectural > profession should police its own ranks, if for no reason than that many > laymen have done their homework in history (as a hobby) and are today well > ahead of architects. Peterson explained that there are very few people who understand older buildings and how they are constructed and \\"as a result, things happen to historic buildings that should not happen to a doghouse.\\" Architects could not simply learn from books and drawings, but had to experience an old building in all its unrestored, disheveled, shabbiness: \\"The man who doesn‚Äôt get his hands dirty on the job will never know enough.\\" Peterson's work in this regard has helped spawn innumerable training programs for architects, such as that offered by the Heritage Conservation Network, that provide hands-on training on a wide variety of techniques from documentation to pointing with lime mortar. Legacy Peterson's legacy can be summed up by his tireless efforts to establish historic preservation as a professional endeavor. He made essential contributions to how old buildings should be documented and architects trained. Every holder of a degree in historic preservation should also credit Peterson for the origins of their education. Lastly, Peterson established a scholarly basis for building interventions. No longer was an antiquarian aesthetic ethic acceptable for historic preservation; all work had to be documented and changes well substantiated with historical records. Roger W Moss, \\"Charles E.

She is currently the Executive Headteacher of the Matrix Academy Trust, a position she accepted after serving as headteacher at Barr Beacon School and as principal at Hillcrest School and Community College in Netherton, West Midlands. In 2012 she was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct by the Teaching Agency Career Brennan worked at Great Barr School in Great Barr, Birmingham as a senior staff member. Brennan let it be known that Hillcrest School had \\"no structures, systems or routines\\" when she took over in September 2002. In 2002 the school came out of special measures. In 2007 Ofsted rated Hillcrest School as \\"outstanding\\" but Brennan and two other teachers was later found guilty of manipulating data. One of her recipes for changing that was the introduction of a \\"house system and a prefectorial system\\". She introduced formal routines such as pupils standing up when someone walks into the classroom; she also got rid of the bells that sounded the end of each lesson. Other measures included a sin bin or exclusion room (dubbed the \\"doom room\\" by the pupils) where misbehaving pupils could go for a period of isolation from their peers. Honours Brennan was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. Attendance manipulation charges On 12 December 2007 it was reported that Brennan and her recent senior management team was under investigation for fraudulent reporting of attendance figures during the time she was headteacher at Hillcrest School and Community College. Dudley Council's investigations ended and the case was passed to the West Midlands Police Economic Crime Team. Brennan was identified in the Dudley report for leading a team of senior managers who EWS (Educational Welfare Service) investigators claim manipulated registers to make the school appear more successful than it actually was. In their interim report, EWS officers alleged that the records created a false impression of improved attendance which promoted the school's image and resulted in higher pupil numbers. West Midlands Police decided there was no case to pursue. On 13 November 2012 Brennan faced a Teaching Agency professional conduct panel in Coventry with teachers Shelley Derham and Linda Westwood, members of her former senior management team. All faced charges of unacceptable professional conduct. Teaching Agency presenting officer, Bradley Albuery, claimed evidence linked the pair to the ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù misrecording to ‚Äúpretend attendance was better than it was‚Äù and to boost perceptions of Hillcrest School. He said GCSE figures were also distorted from 2004 and 2007 by between two and four per cent showing an ‚Äúinflation‚Äù of results. ‚ÄúIt is fanciful to suppose that this headteacher did not know what was going on in her school,‚Äù Mr Albuery said. ‚ÄúThe evidence suggests these were not occasional errors by teachers. [...] In fact it is true that these three teachers were seen as the reason that the school went from failing to successful, and it was for this Maureen Brennan was made a Dame.‚Äù Brennan faced an allegation of failing to ensure pupils received a statutory level of education. The hearing was told how fraud police launched an investigation in 2007, but no charges were brought. This charge was dismissed early in the hearing. All three denied unacceptable professional conduct. The charge of failing to provide an education was dropped and the three were found not to have altered the PLASC return which could have misrecorded achievement in the school. On 28 November 2012, Brennan, along with deputy headteachers Shelley Derham and Linda Westwood, was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct by the Teaching Agency. The disciplinary hearing heard ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù alterations were made to attendance registers for some pupils between 2004 and 2007. A Teaching Agency professional conduct panel ruled all three had acted ‚Äúdishonestly‚Äù by changing records. All three had denied making the changes, but later admitted their guilt. The panel also ruled: ‚ÄúThe misconduct is of a serious nature falling significantly short of the standards of behaviour required of a teacher\\". Departure In 2017, Brennan bid farewell to the school she was head of for 10 years to take up an executive job at the Matrix Academy Trust which runs 4 schools.

He is a Grammy- nominated singer and ‚Äúa pioneer in the world music community with his eclectic East-meets-West sound.‚Äù Biography Uttal grew up in New York City and lived in a home filled with music where he studied classical piano from the age of seven, and later learned to play banjo, harmonica, and guitar. His father was record label executive Larry Uttal. At the age of 17, Uttal heard Indian music for the first time, which he said, ‚Äútouched his heart like sounds of home.‚Äù At 19, Uttal moved to California and studied under Sarod player, Ali Akbar Khan. He later began making regular trips to India where he spent time with practitioners from both Buddhist and Hindu traditions, lived among the Bauls, wandering Bengali street musicians, and singing with the kirtan wallahs in the temple of his Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba. Uttal adopted the spiritual practice of kirtan, the ancient bhakti yoga of chanting the names of God. Artist statement and reception Uttal's music is very popular in the yoga community, being described as ‚Äúvery hypnotic.‚Äù One reviewer stated, ‚ÄúHe does a great job of explaining the purpose of chanting and kirtan.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe practice of calling to the divine creates a bridge between the individual and the eternal, opening the heart and welcoming the spirit.‚Äù Uttal says, ‚ÄúThese ancient chants contain a transformative power and healing energy. By singing these prayers we join a stream of consciousness and devotion that has been flowing for centuries.‚Äù Uttal says, ‚ÄúMusic that creates bridges. Music that unites hearts and cultures. Music that brings peace.‚Äù In one biography it is said, ‚ÄúJai Uttal has cultivated a voice and musical styles that carries the listener into the heart of devotion, prayer, and healing, and to an ecstatic remembrance of the divine.‚Äù Albums In 1990 Uttal released his debut album, Footprints, with Triloka Records, which featured ‚Äúworld music innovator Don Cherry and Indian vocalist Lakshmi Shankar.‚Äù The album was in the top ten on the world music charts. In 1992, Uttal released Monkey. The next year, in 1994, Beggars and Saints was released, which was a ‚Äútribute to the Bauls of Bangal.‚Äù In addition to the new album, Uttal produced two CD's for his teacher, Ustad Ali Akbar. Journey and Garden of Dreams became extremely popular in the Indian community. Three years later, Shiva Station was released, which was mixed by innovative producer, Bill Laswell. Shiva Station presented traditional chants in a totally new way. The concerts united the temple and the nightclub, the sacred and the worldly; emphasizing the underlying theme that spirituality and devotion can pervade all aspects of life. Around this time the popularity of yoga was on the rise. Uttal began to receive more requests to lead kirtan workshops and concerts all over the world. Uttal released a live kirtan CD entitled Nectar to begin to chronicle these kirtan events. In 2000, a compilation of his four Triloka albums appeared as Spirit Room. In February 2002, Jai Uttal and the Pagan Love Orchestra released, on Narada Records, Mondo Rama, which means World is Rama or Everything is God. The album has been called Uttal's most personal expression to date. ‚ÄúCombining Brazilian influences, Hebrew prayers, Appalachian Blues, Beatles psychedelia, and, of course, Indian music and chants, Mondo Rama explodes from the speakers in celebration and rebirth.‚Äù In 2009, Uttal released Thunder Love. One reviewer said the following about the album, ‚Äú[It‚Äôs] a true example of ‚Äòworld music,‚Äô it's a pan-cultural potpourri of sounds and styles from around the globe, seamlessly sewn into a contemporary pop/rock format. Uttal's soulful singing and spiritual themes provide the crucial connective thread throughout the album.\\" 2011 saw the release of Queen of Hearts, a ‚Äúunique mixture of reggae, ska, and samba rhythms, used as a backdrop for call and response, dance oriented kirtan, and invoking Queen Radha (Radharani), the bestower of devotion.‚Äù In 2003, Uttal began the first of several recordings focused on the practice of bhakti yoga (kirtan) for the Sounds True label. These have included: Kirtan! The Art and Practice of Ecstatic Chant, Music for Yoga and Other Joys, Loveland, Dial M for Mantra, and Pranayama, a collaboration with his wife, yoga teacher and bhakti dancer, Nubia Teixeira. The two had a son, Ezra, which led to Uttal's inspiration to focus his work towards kids. Uttal began to lead children's kirtan events near his home in Northern California and he created an album especially for children entitled Kirtan Kids: The Elephant, the Monkey, and the Little Butter Thief. In addition to those, Uttal also hosted donation-based events at several yoga studios. At these particular events, children would sit around in a circle and listen as Uttal told ‚Äúcolorful stories drawn from Ramayana and other Indian myths.‚Äù The chants during these events were kid-friendly versions. ‚ÄúKirtan Kids recreates the feeling of these events and gives parents a new way to introduce children to kirtan.‚Äù The album features ‚Äúan elephant solo, the sounds of banging pots and pans, and music from about a dozen instruments, including the glockenspiel and a toy piano.‚Äù The album also includes ‚Äúnarrated tales of Gopala, the child form of Krishna; the elephant-headed god Ganesha; and the monkey god Hanuman.‚Äù In 2014 Jai Uttal with Ben Leinbach released Lifeline which explores a decade of their collaborations sequenced as an unfolding musical celebration of their favorite tracks ranging from the unadorned primordial chant to layered sacred sound immersions.‚Äù In 2014 Uttal revisited Shiva Station also with Ben Leinbach and re-created his 1997 work to \\"bring us closer to the music itself with unadorned, intimate arrangements that illuminate directly the spiritual heart of each composition.\\"‚Äù In addition to his own works, Uttal also owns the back catalogue to Private Stock Records which was his father's record label in the 1970s.

It runs from the Clark Bridge in Alton north to the Rock Island Centennial Bridge in Rock Island. It is the most direct route between St. Louis and the Quad Cities. This is a distance of . U.S. 67 is the major north-south corridor for western Illinois, and the only major Illinois north-south highway route from 1918 that was never upgraded to the Interstate highway system. Route description US 67 enters Illinois from Iowa by way of the Centennial Bridge that cross the Mississippi River. It is mostly two-lane highway from Rock Island to Monmouth where 67 intersects US 34. From Monmouth, US 67 is interplexed with US 34 until US 34 exits to run west toward Burlington, Iowa. From Monmouth to Macomb, US 67 is a \\"Super Four\\" , four-lane highway. The Roseville Bypass was one of the last bypasses for this section and was completed in 2002. There is a section at Good Hope where the highway runs through town with signals and an at-grade rail crossing. In Macomb, US 67 runs through town as a four-lane arterial road which has an at- grade railroad crossing and several signals. Exiting Macomb, US 67 is a two- lane highway until it reaches just west of Chapin. From west of Chapin to just north of Roodhouse, US 67 is a \\"Super Four\\" , four-lane highway. The portion that passes to the west of Jacksonville is limited access. The limited access section runs for approximately . From where the four-lane highway ends north of Roodhouse to south of Jerseyville (just south of the future Delhi Bypass) US 67 is a two-lane highway. Construction of a new partial-access, divided four-lane expressway route for US 67 between Jacksonville and Alton will follow the US 67 corridor through White Hall, Carrollton, and Jerseyville. Once complete, the new US 67 expressway will end in the north St. Louis suburb of Godfrey and travel on as IL 255, with US 67 leaving the roadway via an exit and flyover ramp‚Äîconstructed during the final segment of IL 255 in 2014‚Äîand proceeding south on Godfrey Road to reach Clark Bridge via the current US 67 alignment (Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) through Alton. The first segment of the four-lane expressway north of IL 255‚Äî5.2 miles from south of the Delhi Bypass to IL 255‚Äîwas completed in 2013 at a cost of $45.6 million. The Illinois Department of Transportation‚Äôs 2019-2024 multi-year program (MYP) contains $24.4 million to construct the next 3.2 miles of four-lane expressway, including the Delhi Bypass. US 67 is an urban roadway through Godfrey and Alton, shifting between two and four lanes, until it exits Illinois by way of the Clark Bridge across the Mississippi River into St. Charles County, Missouri. US 67 heading south of US 136 in McDonough County History In 1918, the Illinois State Legislature established State Bond Issue (SBI) for the establishment of a state road system.Office of Illinois Secretary of State The route for Illinois 3 went from Cairo Junction to Morrison via Rock Island. With the completion of highway bridges over the Mississippi River, Route 67 was extended from St. Louis to Godfrey and replaced the original Illinois 3 to Rock Island. The original northern terminus of US 67 was in Missouri under the US highway enumeration scheme of 1926, likely due to limited bridge crossings over the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. By 1932, with a Mississippi River crossing route determined, US 67 was extended north along Illinois Route 3 to Rock Island. Even though the Old Clark Bridge had been opened to traffic across the Mississippi River at Alton in 1928, US 67 originally crossed the Mississippi River with U.S. Route 66 via the McKinley Bridge from St. Louis to Venice. From Venice, US 67 headed north along what had been Illinois 3 via Alton to Rock Island. The original route of IL 3 from Alton to Jacksonville that became US 67 went through East Newbern, Jerseyville, and Carrollton. In 1926, the northern terminus of U.S. Route 67 was at Alt. US 61 near Fredericktown, Missouri. The route was extended north on Illinois Route 3 (through western Illinois) to its northern terminus in Rock Island, Illinois by 1932. Sometime after 1940, US 67 was routed into Madison County. Then, it was co-signed with Route 66 as both routes went across the McKinley Bridge. By the mid-1940s, US 67 had been rerouted from St. Louis to Alton via the Lewis Bridge over the Missouri River and the Clark Bridge (formerly the Old Clark Bridge) over the Mississippi River. The Alton to Jerseyville section now passed through Godfrey and Delhi. By the mid-1950s, a more direct route for US 67 from Godfrey towards Jacksonville via Greenfield had opened. Heading north from downtown Alton, US 67 was rerouted via an abandoned railroad grade to the northern end of town. Between Fort Bellefontaine, Missouri (near Lewis Bridge) and south of St. Louis, US-67 followed two different routes. Route 67 originally followed Lewis and Clark Blvd. south to St. Louis, while Alternate US-67 turned west on Lindbergh Blvd. through Florissant past Lambert/St. Louis Int'l airport. Alt 67 was reposted as Route 267 along Lindbergh Blvd. In the late 1960s these routes were \\"flipped\\" with US-67 proceeding through Florissant and Hazelwood. In 1962 another reroute took place, due to the completion of a new river bridge over the Illinois River at Beardstown. A new direct route was constructed from this bridge at Beardstown to Rushville, eliminating the earlier US-67 eastern route northeast along current IL-100 to Frederick then turning north to Rushville. A western bypass of downtown Rushville was completed a couple of years later. In 1964, Route 3 replaced US 67A as St. Louis started to eliminate highways such as 67A. A new four-lane Route 3 opened a few years later. In 1968, US-67 was rerouted on a more western route between Jacksonville and Beardstown. The route was the existing IL-104 (Jacksonville to near Merodosia) and IL-100 (near Merodosia to Beardstown). The original US-67 road passed through Virginia on what is now IL-78 (Jacksonville to Virginia) and then on IL-125 (Virginia to Beardstown), which follows the historic Beardstown Post Road and Ohio & Mississippi Railroad right-of-way (later part of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) system before abandonment) between Beardstown and Springfield. Before 1994, US 67 passed through Alton on Belle Street. After 1994, US 67 got a new bridge as well as a new route through Alton. In the summer of 1994, parts of the road were demolished in a span of 8‚Äì10 weeks. Today, the road now runs from Godfrey to Jerseyville to Jacksonville using what used to be IL 267. The old IL 67 that ran through Brighton, IL to Jacksonville is now IL 267. =Proposed Freeway (FAP 413)= In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30 minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 413, was a route that would have extended from the Quad Cities to Interstate 270 in the East St. Louis area, largely along the current U.S 67 alignment. However, the vast majority of the freeway was never built, due to lack of funding. Future While most of the above-mentioned freeway was never built, some portions were. The very southern portion between I-270 and Alton, signed as Illinois Route 255, was completed in 2012. A small bypass to the west of Jacksonville was completed in 1998. A bypass around Jerseyville is planned. The rest of the original FAP 413 corridor is under study for construction as an expressway. Alternate routes =Alternate U.S. Route 67= There were two alternate routes of US 67 in Madison County. The first started south of Alton, the second, north. When US 67 was switched to the Clark Bridge sometime before the mid-1940s, the earlier route of US 67 from St. Louis to Alton became Alt US 67. In the mid-1940s, Alt US 67 was switched from the McKinley Bridge to the MacArthur Bridge. By 1965, the Alt US 67 designation had been dropped and the IL 3 designation had returned to this route. The original IL 3 roadway had been replaced by new alignments in places over the years, however. When US 67 was shifted to a more direct route north of Alton between Godfrey and Jacksonville by the mid-1950s, the old route via Jerseyville and Carrollton became Alt US 67. This designation lasted until around 1965 when the route became IL 267. =Illinois Route 267= Illinois Route 267 was once Alt US 67 from the mid-1950s to 1965 as it went from Godfrey through Jerseyville on its way to meet up with US 67 about ten miles (16 km) south of Jacksonville. This route, despite being one of the most dangerous in central Illinois, has remained unchanged over the years. In 2001, IDOT rerouted US-67 back onto the original (1940) routing (western route) north of Alton to Murrayville and IL-267 was put onto the newer alignment (eastern route) from near Murrayville through Greenfield to Medora. South of Medora to Godfrey the road retained only IL-111, a second number on this section. The rerouting was to accommodate a future \\"Corridor 67\\" expressway that will be built within the next decade or so. IDOT construction began in 2004 near Jacksonville. The new expressway is supposed to follow the corridor through White Hall, Carrollton, and Jerseyville and will end in Godfrey.

It inhabits the Madagascar dry deciduous forests in western and southwestern Madagascar, where it lives from sea level to about between the Tsiribihina and Mangoky rivers. In Malagasy it is called bokiboky (pronounced \\"Boo-ky Boo-ky\\").  Taxonomy  Galidia decemlineata was the scientific name used by Alfred Grandidier in 1867 for a mongoose collected on the west coast of Madagascar. It was placed in the genus Mungotictis by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1915. = Phylogeny = The narrow- striped mongoose is part of the Malagasy carnivore family Eupleridae that forms a monophyletic clade. It shares a common ancestor with sister clades of the Feliformia. Behaviour and ecology  Illustration of the narrow-striped mongoose, 1848 The narrow-striped mongoose is diurnal and lives in matriarchal family groups that practice cooperative rearing of young. Usually, the young of the alpha female will get the most care, and often the lower ranking females' young is neglected to the point of abandonment. The narrow-striped mongoose demonstrates two unique social behaviours. Females form home ranges in their habitat, where 1-3 females form a stable social unit with their offspring. Males also form their own social units with 2-4 adult males. The male units have a large home range, which often overlap with at least 3 female social units, where mates find one another. The narrow-striped mongoose creates small nests in trees and brush, and has been known to share trees with Lepilemur species, with which it apparently has little or no interaction. Results of a few studies suggest that the narrow-striped mongoose is primarily insectivorous, but eats also bird eggs and a variety of small animals including rodents, birds, snakes, and even small lemur species such as the gray mouse lemur. = Reproduction = Males often mate with more than one female and are considered polygamous. Females may also mate with more than one male. Narrow-striped mongooses of neighbouring units are closely related, with females more closely related than males, most likely because female disperse in a smaller area. Females give birth to one offspring per season, which is usually born at the end of the dry season between October and December. If the cub dies, they give birth to another one by February or March. Many offspring do not survive. There is about a 28% success rate of young surviving, and it is often the oldest offspring of the most dominant female that will prevail. The gestation period lasts 74‚Äì106 days. = Feeding habits = The narrow- striped mongoose forages in top soil, ground litter and rotten wood from fallen trees. A study in the Kirindy Forest revealed that its diet consists foremost of invertebrates. It feeds on arthropods, insect larvae, gastropods. Remains of reptile eggs, bones and feathers were also found in scat collected. Air-dried scat was used to determine preferences in the diet of the narrow- striped mongoose. Evidence showed that its diet included reptile egg membrane, bones, feathers and fragments of arthropods. Invertebrates were its main source of food during the dry season of May to August and the wet season of January to March in the Kirindy Forest. The Jaccard index was used to determine which prey items and arthropods it preferred to eat during each season of the year. The results indicated that it consumes any food that was available; it was not selective towards any particular prey item. Insect larva was a main part of its diet. It forages in top soil, ground litter, and rotten wood from fallen trees, which shows how insect larvae could be considered a staple part of its diet. Gastropoda were also found as a main source of food during rainy seasons. Conservation The narrow-striped mongoose is currently classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List because it occurs in a severely fragmented area and is threatened by habitat loss due to logging and conversion to agriculturally used land. The western dry forests are both highly fragmented and under higher human pressure than the eastern rain forests.

He is the founder of the modern-day Ottawa Senators NHL professional ice hockey club and former part-owner of the Ottawa Rough Riders CFL football club. Business career Dr. Firestone received his Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from McGill University in Montr√©al; his Master of Engineering-Science (Traffic and Transportation) from the University of New South Wales in Sydney and his PhD in Urban Economics from the Australian National University in Canberra. After graduating from university in Australia, Firestone joined the family firm Terrace Developments in the early 1980s. Along with developing commercial properties, Firestone also launched a business newspaper in Ottawa and built several buildings in downtown Ottawa and in Bells Corners. When the NHL announced that it was interested in expanding in the late 1980s, Firestone, then president of Terrace Investments, formed an organization to win an NHL franchise for Ottawa. Firestone's vision was to use the club as the centerpiece of a new commercial development to the west of the City of Ottawa. A new arena would be built, increasing land values in the surrounding area to the point where the expected franchise fee of $30 million US dollars (it would actually be $50 million) could be raised through land sales and commercial development fees and profits. Firestone's group was successful in winning a new franchise, along with the Tampa Bay Lightning, on condition that the franchise would build a new arena to NHL standards. The arena location, on undeveloped farmland, was controversial and opposition grew against the paving over of the farmland. Eventually, the government agency responsible for local development allowed the development of the arena but not the surrounding lands. As well, as part of the development agreement for the new arena, then known as the Palladium, the Government of Ontario required that the corporation pay for all of the required infrastructure, including a freeway interchange. These conditions led to the search for new financing. The search led to the turnover of the ownership of the Ottawa Senators to a partnership led by Rod Bryden. Bryden was able to arrange financing of the development through a partnership with Ogden Entertainment and Bruce left to allow the franchise to continue. After leaving the Senators organization, Firestone became chairman and part-owner of the Ottawa Rough Riders Canadian Football League football team. After one year with the organization it was sold to Horn Chen and Firestone returned to real estate development. In 2004, Firestone founded Exploriem.org, a registered Canadian Not-For-Profit Professional Entrepreneurs and Intrapreneurs Organization. He is the Executive Director of the organization which helps entrepreneurs and start-ups get a foothold in the local business community through business model competitions, funding, mentoring, and providing free office space. Exploriem is also partnered with OCRI (Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation), Algonquin College, Lead to Win and others within the Ottawa business community. Firestone was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa and is a commercial real estate agent. As well he has written the Entrepreneurs Handbook which is a guide to help entrepreneurs get started using the bootstrap method and starting with a good business model.

Brydenhttp://ottawasporthalloffame.ca/inductees/roderick-rod-m- bryden/ (born March 13, 1941) is a prominent Ottawa business executive. He is best known as the former owner of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League from 1992 until 2003.  Biography  Bryden was born in Port Elgin, New Brunswick. He obtained a B.A. Hon. Ec., from Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick; an LLB, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton; and an LLM, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He taught law at the University of Saskatchewan as assistant law professor, from 1966 to 1969 before moving to Ontario, where he held a succession of positions in the Canadian federal government. In 1974, Bryden founded Systemhouse Ltd., a computer integration firm where he served as president or chairman until 1991. In 1979, he founded Paperboard Industries Corporation (PIC) by purchasing Trent Valley Paperboard Mills. He served as chairman of PIC until 1991. Both companies were enjoying annual revenues of over $700 million when he stepped down that year. In 1992, Bryden became CEO of Terrace Corporation, the principal owner of the new Ottawa Senators NHL franchise. In 1993, he became the franchise's Chairman and Governor. In 1994, construction on the Palladium arena (later the Corel Centre and Scotiabank Place, Now the Canadian Tire Centre) was begun by the Palladium Corporation, of which Bryden was the owner and chairman. The arena opened in 1996. In 1996, Bryden formed the WorldHeart Corporation in coalition with the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Dr. Tofy Mussivand and Dr. Michael Cowpland. Bryden served as president and CEO of the company before resigning in 2004. Late in 2004, Bryden avoided personal bankruptcy, brought on by $100 million of debt personally owed to creditors and investors of the Ottawa Senators franchise. Bryden agreed to pay creditors a total of $600,000 on the debt, which was induced by high player salaries and an unfavourable exchange rate against the US dollar. In 2005, Bryden was appointed as the new chairman of cancer drug developer PharmaGap, Inc. Until 2014, he was President and CEO of Plasco Energy Group, an Ottawa firm developing energy production using plasma gasification, from household waste. A year later, Plasco filed for protection under CCAA. Seven months later, Mr. Bryden purchased the company from its secured lenders and led its rebuilding. He also is the chairman of the board of SC Stormont Inc., and Chairman of the board of PharmaGap Inc. Bryden is also on the Board of Directors of Clearford Industries and Gallium Software Inc.

Unusually, rather than contrasting panels this uses a factory two-tone also available to the public. A typical modern day adaptation of the black and white livery on a police car Black and white is an American slang term for a police car that is painted in large panels of black and white, or generally any \\"marked\\" police car. Historically, this scheme is much favored by North American police forces because it allows the unambiguous recognition of patrol units from a significant distance. However, as the color scheme is not standardized, each police agency in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. can choose their own color scheme. The most common variant of the black and white color scheme is white roof and four white doors, the second most common is white roof and only the two front doors. In Finland and Sweden, the black and white police cars had black roofs to make them visible in high snow. Brazil The Rio de Janeiro Civil Police use a black and white livery, top half of the car white and bottom half black, with the black sloping downwards as it nears the front of the car. Canada =Alberta= Calgary Police Service has been replacing its blue and white Ford Crown Victoria cars with black and white Ford Police Interceptor Sedans since as early as September 2013.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-police-switching-to-black- and-white-cars-1.1700245 Edmonton Police Service returned to the black and white colour scheme for newly acquired vehicles starting in 2011; existing vehicles retain their white colour scheme. =British Columbia= Abbotsford Police Department of Abbotsford, British Columbia now has a black and white scheme for their vehicles. Saanich Police have chosen a blue and white version for their cars. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service in British Columbia also uses a black and white scheme. Vancouver, Victoria, Port Moody, New Westminster, and Central Saanich are all using black and white police cars. West Vancouver Police Department in British Columbia also has started to use the black and white livery. =Ontario= Ontario Provincial Police has recently (2007) reverted to a black and white scheme for their fleet. The force used this scheme on their police cars from 1941 to 1989, earning them the nickname \\"Holsteins\\" during that period, especially in the 1950s. Chile Carabineros de Chile Opel Optra 1.6 ls Until 1998, all Carabineros de Chile vehicles were painted with the same pattern that LAPD uses. These days the vehicles are painted with a pattern that includes green and white, this make the cars looks like the police uniform that is all green. Finland Finnish police van colloquially known as the \\"Musta Maija\\" (\\"Black Mary\\"). Finnish police vans are colloquially known as the \\"Musta Maija\\" (\\"Black Maria\\"). Since Finland is a bilingual country, police patrol vehicles feature the text \\"Police\\" in both Finnish (\\"Poliisi\\", on the vehicle's right side) and Swedish (\\"Polis\\", on the driver's side). France French police Renault R5 with black hood and doors French police vehicles were painted like the Swedish ones before resorting to all white with red/white/blue striping.

New Zealand All Traffic Police cars of the Ministry of Transport throughout the 1970s and 1980s were black with white doors and roof. This distinguished them from the all white cars of the New Zealand Police. The Traffic enforcement functions of the MOT were merged into the New Zealand Police in 1992. Today NZ Police vehicles are single colour, usually white, often with Battenberg markings. Portugal Lisbon Municipal Police Nissan Almera painted white, with checkered black and white side stripes Until the middle 1990s, the vehicles of the Lisbon Municipal Police were painted with the same pattern of the Los Angeles Police Department. The black and white livery of the vehicles reflected the colors of the Flag of the City of Lisbon. Since the middle 1990s, the vehicles of this police force are entirely white, with a stripe along the sides checkered with the black and white gyronny field of the Flag of Lisbon. Spain Renault used by police in Madrid, Spain Police in Madrid use black and white cars. Sweden Swedish police vehicles were originally painted black and white, but in the reverse of the Californian-style pattern. Swedish police vehicles had black roofs, doors, trunk and bonnet or black roofs, bonnet and boot. This came out of necessity, due to the heavy snowfall in Sweden as with high snow obscuring everything but the roof a white roof would be hard to see. In slang they were named black- and-white people-catchers. In the 1960s the police in Stockholm used three Land-Rovers for monitoring entries into Stockholm and to make them stand out they were painted yellow. Taiwan Black and white unit used in Taichung, Taiwan Taichung police use black and white cars. United States =Los Angeles Police Department= quintessential LAPD black and white Like most police agencies throughout southern California, the Los Angeles Police Department vehicles are ordered painted in black clearcoat with the roof, doors, and pillars painted white from the factory. Three vehicles are approved for use within the Los Angeles Police Department, they are the Ford Taurus, Ford Explorer and the Dodge Charger. Only the sedans are permitted to engage in a vehicle pursuit, pursuant to department policy. Options available from Ford ordered by the department include the handle-bar spotlights, 16-inch heavy duty steel wheels with chrome center caps, and ballistic panels within the two front doors. Installed equipment includes the lightbar, front-grill siren and control box from Federal Signal Corporation, the digital two-way radio by Motorola, a notebook PC to function as the Mobile data terminal, and a partition to separate the prisoner rear seating from the driver and front passenger seats. The so-called \\"A-cars\\" and \\"X-cars\\" (eXtra patrol) also have a shotgun mounted between the front seats in front of the partition. Some police vehicles bear two rear bumper stickers: one reading \\"There's NO Excuse - For Domestic Violence\\" and another for \\"DARE\\" Drug Abuse Resistance Education. On the rear side panel is a black and white sticker that reads \\"EMERGENCY DIAL 9-1-1 Fire Police Medical.\\" The front doors bears the seal of the City of Los Angeles, the department slogan \\"to protect and to serve\\" as well as the citywide five-digit \\"shop number\\" and city department name (POLICE).

It is notable for being the aircraft piloted by Lt. Col. (then Captain) Jay Zeamer on the 16 June 1943 mission that would earn him and 2d Lt. Joseph Sarnoski each a Medal of Honor, and all other members of the crew the Distinguished Service Cross. History B-17E #41-2666 was built in Seattle, Washington in March 1942. It arrived in Hawaii in May 1942 for delivery to Australia. That same month, it was assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group. Sometime after it arrived in Australia, 41-2666 was equipped with a trimetrogon camera array used in high-altitude topographical mapping. During the summer and fall of 1942, the aircraft was flown primarily by the 8th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron (PRS), usually while attached to the 19th.Stanaway and Rocker 1999, p. 8. Late in the year it was transferred to the 43rd Bomb Group, where on a mission in December 1942 it was damaged severely enough to be grounded for a period of time. Nothing more is currently known about the aircraft until the following April, when it was again being flown by the 8th PRS. In May 1943, having gained a reputation as a ‚ÄúHard Luck Hattie‚Äù for its record of damage and odd accidents, 41-2666 was transferred to the 65th Bomb Squadron, 43rd Bomb Group, at Seven-Mile Airstrip, located at Port Moresby, New Guinea.Stanaway and Rocker 1999, p. 69. It was in the 65th that then- Captain Jay Zeamer, serving as squadron executive officer, requisitioned the aircraft for his crew, known as the ‚ÄúEager Beavers,‚Äù to customize for their use in photo-mapping and reconnaissance work. Besides significantly reducing the overall weight and replacing the engines, the crew installed additional .50 caliber machine guns, including a .50 mounted to the bombardier's deck in the nose that Zeamer could fire himself.Zeamer 1945, p. 105 While that and the sheer number of guns on '666 was remarkable‚Äîthe common gun complement on a Pacific B-17E was thirteen‚Äîwhat made Zeamer's upgrade unique in the Pacific was the crew's installation of twin .50s in both waist positions. As for a name, the regular crew referred to 41-2666 only as \\"666\\" or \\"the plane\\". The plane was indeed officially nicknamed \\"Lucy\\", but only shortly before the 16 June 1943 mission‚Äînot in time for the crew to begin referring to it as such. Because of its specialized use for camera work, and despite their extensive work on the plane, Zeamer and his crew flew 41-2666 only five times, two of which were test hops. Bombing missions were flown in B-17s suited to that purpose, with their use of 41-2666 restricted to three photo-mapping missions. Jay Zeamer flight log Mapping mission Tenacity over Bougainville: Zeamer and the ‚ÄúEager Beavers‚Äù display in the World War II Gallery at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force The last of these missions occurred on June 16, 1943. It called for a solo B-17 to map the west coast of Bougainville, almost six hundred miles over mostly open ocean from Seven-Mile, in support of a planned invasion of the island later that year. Such mapping demanded rigorously straight and level flight for the duration to avoid blurring of the photos, and this mission would require a 22-minute such run over hostile territory. Zeamer had volunteered for the mission when it was first requested in April, but weather and other factors forced postponements until the June date.Murphy 1993, p. 167. Twice before taking off at 4:00 a.m., June 16, Zeamer rejected orders to add to the mission a reconnaissance of Buka airdrome, located off Bougainville's northern tip. The mapping would be hazardous enough, he felt, without adding extended contact with the enemy just prior.Murphy 1993, p. 167. Early arrival to the initial mapping point meant a half-hour delay in starting the mapping run; the sun was not high enough for the light necessary for topographic relief.Murphy 1993, p. 168. The delay prompted Zeamer to ask the crew's opinion on the Buka recon. All supported going ahead with it, considering their proximity. As a result, Zeamer adjusted course northeast to take them over Buka airstrip before heading into the mapping run down Bougainville's west coast. Contemporary accounts from the crew report counting around fifty aircraft on either side of the Buka airstrip, with seventeen or eighteen Japanese aircraft either taxiing or taking off from Buka airstrip as \\"Old 666\\" covered the island. These were Japanese Navy fighters, Model 22 Zeroes of Air Squadron 251, most of which were usually based at Rabaul, New Britain, but had moved to Buka the previous day for their planned June 16 attack on Guadalcanal. Zeamer began the mapping run, hoping that it could be finished before the enemy aircraft could reach their mapping altitude of 25,000 feet. Shortly before its completion, ineffectual passes from below were followed by a handful of Zeros enclosing the B-17 in a coordinated attack from below, two approaching from the rear and three fanned across the front. The combination left Zeamer unable to execute his usual defensive tactic of turning inside the line of fire of enemy aircraft attacking from the front; such a maneuver in this case would expose the B-17's belly to the other Zeros attacking from the front. Aware of their position now over Empress Augusta Bay, the primary mapping objective, Zeamer held course, hoping to fight it out.Murphy 1993, p. 169. This first attack proved fatal for bombardier Sarnoski, who was mortally wounded by a 20mm shell which also badly injured the navigator, 1st Lt. Ruby Johnston. Another 20mm struck the side of the cockpit behind the pilots, sending shrapnel into the legs of Sgt. Johnny Able, the assistant flight engineer substituting as top turret gunner that day. It also struck the oxygen and hydraulic lines behind the cockpit, starting a fire. A third 20mm entered through the Plexiglass nose, destroying Zeamer's rudder pedals and instrument panel and delivering grievous wounds to Zeamer's left leg and slicing his right wrist. Farther back, radio operator Sgt. William Vaughan was grazed badly in the neck by a bullet. Back in the nose, despite being blown to the floor with a horrible gash in his side and another in his neck, Sarnoski regained his gun in time to counter a twin-engine fighter‚Äîvariously described by crew members as either a Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" or Kawasaki Ki-45 \\"Nick\\"‚Äîpressing a new attack on the nose. Sarnoski drove the attacker off before it could inflict any more damage and then collapsed from his wounds.Gamble 2013, p. 80. Having finished the mapping run and now needing oxygen, Zeamer dove the plane from 25,000 feet to around 10,000 feet, estimating his altitude from a change in manifold pressure, since the altimeter had been destroyed. After the dive, both Johnston and Able extinguished the oxygen fire using only their hands and rags.Zeamer 1945, p. 106 Leveling out, Zeamer continued to pilot \\"Old 666\\" despite excruciating pain and continued blood loss. Correctly assuming its forward guns were now inoperable, the Japanese began lining up on both sides of the B-17 to circle around, one by one in turn, to strafe the aircraft from the front. Zeamer was now able to apply the technique he'd been unable to use against the coordinated first pass: banking hard inside the firing angle of each approaching Zero, Zeamer both avoided the enemy's fire and allowed his rear gunners unfettered access to the Zeros as they passed by the B-17. This continued until finally, low on ammunition and fuel, around forty minutes after the initial attack, the last of the remaining Zeros returned home. While the crew reported downing five fighters, Japanese records show none were actually shot down, with one ditching early in the engagement due to engine failure and only three being damaged by return fire.Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, Item ID C08051658400, pp. 44-45. Once out of danger, Sgt. Able piloted \\"Old 666\\" on a dead reckoning return heading determined by Zeamer while the unscathed substitute copilot, Lt. J.T. Britton, took stock of the damage to the crew and plane. Zeamer, drifting in and out of unconsciousness, advised Able on keeping course and level. Radio operator Vaughan, while nursing his neck wound, calculated a heading for Dobodura, an Allied airstrip on the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea, for an emergency landing. It was not expected that Zeamer would survive a return flight over the Owen-Stanley mountains to Port Moresby. Britton, having returned to his seat for the balance of the flight, landed at Dobodura without flaps or brakes, requiring him to ground loop the bomber near the end of the six-thousand-foot runway. In all, four members of the crew were wounded and one killed. The aircraft suffered damage to the instrument panel from being struck by a 20mm gun, and the pilot's rudder pedals were destroyed. For the completion of their mission despite the certainty of attack and their respective sacrifices, Sarnoski and Zeamer each received the Medal of Honor, with the remainder of the crew receiving the Distinguished Service Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor in esteem. The mission remains the most highly decorated in American history, and the Eager Beavers, individual decorations all considered, remain the most highly decorated air crew in U.S. history. This mission was featured on the History Channel show Dogfights in an episode titled \\"Long Odds\\". After the mission Seven of the eight Zero pilots who intercepted \\"Old 666\\" later participated in a strike on Allied shipping at Lunga Point that same day. Two of them, Warrant Officer Yoshio Oki and Flight Petty Officer 2nd Class Suehiro Yamamoto, failed to return.Gamble 2013, p. 81.Drury and Clavin, p. 267. By mid-1943, like most heavy bomb groups in the Pacific, the 43rd had mostly converted to the B-24. The aging and much-abused Pacific Fortresses were increasingly difficult to maintain, and the longer range of the B-24 made it more practical anyway in a theater defined by the vast distances to targets. Due to its specialized nature, 41-2666 evaded retirement despite the damage received on the 16 June 43 mission. Repairs and modifications reversed many of the changes made by the Eager Beavers. The plane was returned to the 8th PRS, and by fall had even returned to combat, flying two missions with the 63rd Bombardment Squadron. By March 1944, though, it had been returned to the US to be used first as a base transport aircraft and then as a heavy bomber trainer, before finally being flown to Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 1945 to be sold as scrap metal.

From 2011 to 2013 she was Chair of the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care. =Caldicott Committee= A review was commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer of England and Wales owing to increasing concern about the ways in which patient information is used in the NHS of England and Wales and the need to ensure that confidentiality is not undermined. Such concern was largely due to the development of information technology in the service, and its capacity to disseminate information about patients rapidly and extensively. In 1996, guidance on \\"the protection and use of patient information\\" was promulgated and there was a need to promote awareness of it at all levels in the NHS. It did not affect Scotland originally but they have recently adopted it. A main committee was set up under Caldicott's Chair and there were four separate working groups; the committee was known as the Caldicott Committee. The Caldicott Committee ... was [responsible] to review all patient-identifiable information, which passes from NHS organisations to other NHS or non-NHS bodies for purposes other than direct care, medical research, or where there is a statutory requirement for information. The committee was to consider each flow of patient-identifiable information and was to advise the NHS Executive whether patient identification was justified by the purpose and whether action to minimise risks of breach of confidentiality was desirable‚Äîfor example, reduction, elimination, or separate storage of items of information. The Caldicott Report was published in December 1997.Caldicott Report .

Created by Impossible Pictures and produced by the BBC Natural History Unit, the Discovery Channel and ProSieben, The Giant Claw was first broadcast on 30 December 2002, followed by Land of Giants on 1 January 2003. The two episodes stars British wildlife presenter Nigel Marven as a \\"time-travelling zoologist\\", interacting with dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, a drastic change in presentation from preceding entries in the Walking with... franchise. As with previous documentaries in the Walking with... franchise, Land of Giants and The Giant Claw recreated extinct animals through a combination of computer-generated imagery and animatronics, incorporated into live action footage shot at various locations. The visual effects of the episodes were praised, with both episodes together winning the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Programme in 2004 and The Giant Claw winning a BAFTA TV Award for Best Visual Effects in 2003. For his role as the presenter of Land of Giants, and of the subsequent miniseries Sea Monsters, Marven was nominated for a Royal Television Society Programme award.  Production  Land of Giants and The Giant Claw were created by Impossible Pictures, creators of the original series of Walking with Dinosaurs. The same technologies used to restore the animals in the previous series were used to reconstruct the prehistoric creatures and environments showcased in the specials, with computer-generated animals and animatronics being used for the animals and background footage being shot in real natural environments. Because grass had not yet evolved in the Cretaceous, the location team had to look for filming sites where there was no grass. Filming locations included Fraser Island in Australia and Tenerife (including the lava-covered slopes of Mount Teide, prominently figuring in Land of Giants) in the Canary Islands. The decision to include a wildlife presenter, The Giant Claw being the first time a wildlife presenter had ever been depicted interacting with computer-generated dinosaurs, was made to more easily allow the audience to see the true scale of the creatures shown in the programme. Tim Haines, the creator of Walking with Dinosaurs, had seen Nigel Marven's work with modern-day reptiles and approached him about the possibility of producing a programme in which Marven travelled back in time to meet dinosaurs, a prospect which Marven was enthusiastic about. In one segment of The Giant Claw, Marven is chased by velociraptors and has to climb up a tree to escape. While climbing, Marven accidentally put his finger under a vine before stepping on it, which led to one of his fingernails being pulled off. In order to protect himself from infection, Marven then had to wear a bandage on his finger. The bandage and injury was incorporated into the story of the episode, with a Mononykus being depicted as biting Marven's finger.  Episodes   Reception  = Awards = In 2003, The Giant Claw won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Visual Effects. In 2004, The Giant Claw and Land of Giants won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Programme. For his work in Land of Giants and in the subsequent miniseries Sea Monsters, also part of the Walking with... series and produced by Impossible Pictures, Nigel Marven was nominated for a Royal Television Society Programme award in 2004 for best presenter (factual).

Chennai). He was the chief of the Masulipatnam factory when Madras was purchased from Peda Venkata Raya, the last king of the Aravidu dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire, the capital of which was at Chandragiri. As such Cogan is a significant figure in the history of the English colonial empire.  Purchase of Madras  In 1637, Francis Day, a member of the Masulipatnam Council and Chief of the Armagon Factory, made a voyage of exploration down the Coromandel Coast as far as Pondicherry. At that time, the Coromandel Coast was ruled by the Raja of Chandragiri through a local chief or Nayak, Damarla Venkatapathy Nayak, who ruled the coast from Pulicat up to San Thome. He had his seat at Wandiwash and his brother, Ayyappa Nayak resided at Poonamallee. It is widely presumed that Ayyappa Nayak was the one who made overtures to the English to choose the area comprising the modern-day George Town for settlement. The offer looked good, and Day consulted Cogan, his superior, who investigated the proposed site and examined trading possibilities there. The results were favourable and Day secured a grant offering the village of Madraspatnam to the English for a period of two years. The grant was dated August 1639, and after obtaining the approval of the Factory at Masulipatnam and the Presidency of Bantam (in Java), the settlement of Madraspatnam was begun.  Construction of Fort St. George  Day and Cogan were jointly responsible for the construction of Fort St. George. The building of the Factory House was taken up on 1 March 1640. A portion of the structure was presumably completed by St. George's Day (23 April) of that year and consequently the name \\"Fort St. George\\" was given to the fort. The bastions were the first fortifications constructed; erection of the curtain walls connecting them proceeded more slowly, as it constructed in stages as funds permitted. The whole Fort took fourteen years to construct and was finished only in 1653.  Cogan's agency  Soon after the construction of Fort St. George had begun, Day was charged with the offence of trading privately, outside of his parent company, and he left for England in 1641. During his absence, Cogan was made the Agent of Madras and he remained in the post for more than three years. During his time in power he strengthened the fortifications and strove to make the town prosperous. But, he was charged with extravagant expenditure on the fortifications; as a consequence of which he resigned his post and sailed to England in disgust. Day assumed the Agency of Madras and served as agent for a short time thereafter.  Personal life  After returning to England, Cogan was an active supporter of the Royalist cause during the English civil war (1642‚Äì1651). Following the Royalists' defeat (1653), he went into exile and his estates were confiscated. However, in 1657, following the Restoration Cogan was made a knight of Ireland, as Sir Andrew Cogan, Baronet of Greenwich. He died in or about 1660.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the site of several structures independently listed on the Register. History The Anna‚ÄìDean farm was a concept of American industrialist O.C. Barber who envisioned a superfarm on the outskirts of Barberton, and to that end he began purchasing land for the eventual farm as early as 1900. Construction of the farm facilities began in 1907 with a concrete poultry building but would not truly begin in earnest until 1909 when Barber undertook a massive construction project that would last until 1913. With an estimated daily construction budget of over $1,000 and an overall cost of some $7 million the farm had swelled to a collection of 35 independent structures. While Barber claims in his own book a total of 102 structures it is likely he included in his tally preexisting structures that had been incorporated into the farm during its expansion. The centerpiece of the farm was the 52 room Beaux Arts style mansion Barber constructed in 1909 to 1910. According to the Barberton Historical Society, it was demolished in 1965. Following Barber's death in 1920, the majority of the structures on the farm were demolished. Efforts by the Barberton Historical Society have succeeded in preserving and restoring 6 of the original buildings, with 2 others still standing in other private possession.

It prescribes that a function that maps a set of input values I to a set of output values O should be chosen or learned so as to maximize the average Shannon mutual information between I and O, subject to a set of specified constraints and/or noise processes. Infomax algorithms are learning algorithms that perform this optimization process. The principle was described by Linsker in 1988. Infomax, in its zero-noise limit, is related to the principle of redundancy reduction proposed for biological sensory processing by Horace Barlow in 1961, and applied quantitatively to retinal processing by Atick and Redlich. One of the applications of infomax has been to an independent component analysis algorithm that finds independent signals by maximizing entropy.

Students participate in residence hall activities, leadership positions, community service projects, relationships with alumni, and the cooperative work program. Cooperative Work Program One of the fundamental aspects of the Stadium Scholarship Program is the cooperative work program. Students work 5-7 hours a week, or 50-70 hours a quarter in the hall in exchange for the reduced discount housing fees received at the beginning of every quarter. Hours are flexible around class and exam schedules. History =Origins= The concept was the brainchild of Joseph A. Park, who was the university's dean of men at the time. Park noticed that many Ohio high school students weren't going to college because they could not afford it. In 1933, a group of 75 young male students with limited financial means moved into the Ohio Stadium. Those young men lived in barrack-like conditions in the stadium's southwest corner, which would become known as the Tower Club. In exchange for a break on rent, the young men did all the chores in the no-frills dorm, except cooking, while they attended classes at the Ohio State University. In subsequent years, the dorm expanded along the west side of the stadium and additional names, such as Buckeye and Tower clubs, were placed on the living quarters. Through the years, the unique dorm gained national attention. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt even visited the student living quarters housed in the Horseshoe. And, in more recent history, the dorm was featured several times during nationally televised OSU football games. =Departure from Ohio Stadium= In 1975, the program and the Stadium dormitory were expanded several times. The university completed a multimillion-dollar renovation in the mid-1980s resulting in a residence hall that housed approximately 360 students. In the late 1990s, the university sought to expand and renovate Ohio Stadium. The decision was made to move the Stadium Scholarship Program to Mack Hall. =Second Relocation= The stadium Scholarship program called Mack Hall its home for several years before moving to its current location at the Scholars houses on 10th ave.

The capacity of the coliseum is 6,100. History The Rizal Memorial Coliseum prior to the 2019 renovation The Rizal Memorial Coliseum within the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex was built on the former site of Manila Carnival Grounds in 1934 as a tennis stadium named \\"Rizal Memorial Tennis Stadium\\", but was later renamed ‚ÄúRizal Memorial Coliseum‚Äù at an unknown time. It became a primary venue for the UAAP and the NCAA, before moving to much-larger venues such as the Araneta Coliseum. It was one of the buildings that were destroyed during the Battle of Manila of World War II in 1945 and was reconstructed in 1953 for the 1954 Asian Games. It was also one of the venues of now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA) as the home court of the Manila Metrostars during the inaugural season in 1998. =2019 renovation and restoration= The venue was used and renovated for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. The renovation was funded from the given by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation to the Philippine Sports Commission. Renovation work which will cover both the interior and exterior of the facility began on July 8, 2019, after getting approval from three government agencies, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), and the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP). ME Sicat Construction is the contractor for the renovation project which secured its role through bidding. ME Sicat hired the service of heritage conservationist and architect Gerard Lico for the renovation. Unlike the previous renovations which were minor, for the first time since the rebuilt of the coliseum in 1953, the renovation will be a major overhaul. The renovation process includes near restoration of the building to its state in the 1930s and the installation of new plastic seats and retractable seating system, flooring, plumbing, fireproofing, electrical system and for the first time in coliseum's history, air conditioning system, while keeping the original look of the building designed by Juan Arellano. Lico and his team used the archival materials by the collectors to restore its original design including from Jorge B. Vargas (who was a founding member of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation and the first Filipino member of the International Olympic Committee). Part of its restoration are the repainting of the coliseum's color back into its original which is based from using paint scraping of the building, removals of add-on canopy that was added during the 1970s, metal dividers at the entrance, and wire mesh that separated the spectator area, discoveries of some of its original designs that were covered or removed during its previous renovations (such as the porthole windows and two side rooms at the lobby, grillworks that bears the letters \\"T\\" and \\"S\\", referring the coliseum's original name and a replica of the lightning fixtures), replacement of faux marble into a real marble, replacement of grillworks to floor-to-ceiling glass at the entrances, and the addition of the art-deco style elements on its locker and comfort rooms. Also part of its restoration is the gallery room which is the exhibit of the old photographs, tickets and posters of some notable events held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex that are part of Vargas' collection. Lico revealed that he spend his own money for the gallery room as it was not included of the renovation budget and he insisted to include it to make people connect with the importance history of the complex. He added that the three government agencies didn't want the idea of gallery room but ME Sicat convinced them to approve it. As for the installation of the air conditioning system for the first time, Lico and his team removed the building's blowers, vents, and exhaust fans and covered the ceiling with a two-inch foaming insulation to absorb outdoor noise. They installed the ducts of the air-conditioning which are all in industrial style to match with the building's interior and also evocative of ocean liners, a significant element of industrialization during the 1930s. The renovation made its capacity decreased from 8,000 to only 6,100. The restoration work of the coliseum is in accordance to the plan by the NHCP, the agency which declared the complex as a \\"National Historical Landmark\\". 285 workers are working for the renovation around the clock in 3 shifts. This led both the UAAP and the NCAA expressed interest to hold their respective games on the coliseum again. After only four months, the renovation was completed on November 27, 2019. The coliseum hosted the gymnastics competitions during the biennial games. Previous proposed plans The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) unveiled plans for the conversion of the Rizal Memorial Coliseum into a Philippine Sports Museum and the Asian Games Museum which houses the memorabilia of Philippine and Asian sports icons and hall of famers. The current location of the PSM is located at the second floor of the PSC building inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. There was a plan to demolish the site before the PSC's announcement. On November 22, 2016, then-Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada announced that the city government is making a partnership with businessman Enrique Razon to convert the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (which includes a coliseum) into a commercial center which will include a mall and cinemas. The plan was to build-up contemporary buildings and commercial structures with modern smart technologies and amenities, as well as more greener open spaces within the property. A sports museum would also be construct here, while the facade of the Rizal Memorial Coliseum would be retained. The plan was criticized by various heritage and athletes groups with an online petition posted on Change.org was initiated to save the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex amid several reports on the planned redevelopment. The plan was also criticized by the Heritage Conservation Society, questioning if Manila needs another shopping mall. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts also stated that the city government of Estrada never consulted the agency regarding their plans on the sports venue in particular despite promising to cooperate with the government body on cultural conservation in a meeting initiated by the Manila government on May 2016. Estrada defended the redevelopment of the RMSC, said that no one uses the complex anymore and it became old, and antiquated. However in April 2017, the sports complex was declared as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and an Important Cultural Property by the National Museum of the Philippines ensuring the site's preservation due to the National Cultural Heritage Act. Because of the declaration, the Razon group later dropped its bid to redevelop the complex and the Philippine Sports Commission halted its negotiations with the Manila City government on the planned sale of RMSC, instead it will be focused now on rehabilitating the sports complex. On August 7, 2019, both the PSC and the Manila City government (now under the administration of Mayor Isko Moreno) agreed to not selling the complex. Architecture and design Juan Arellano was the architect responsible for the design of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex including the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. The Rizal Memorial Coliseum exhibits an Art Deco style architecture, particularly Streamline Moderne.

Her father was Swiss and had left Switzerland to work in London where he found a position as a caterer.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Marea possessed natural ability as a runner and in the early 1930s as a member of Spartan Ladies Athletic Club she was representing her club and her county of Surrey. She left home at an early age lodging in Clapham in south London and working for the paper manufacturers Bowater as a human resources officer devoting her non-work time to women's athletics. Any chances that Hartman would become an International athlete were ended by the onset of war during which conflict she served in the Welfare Division based in London. Eminent sports administrator Marea Hartman was one of the few women, along with Dorothy Nelson Neal and Vera Searle, who reached senior positions in the male- dominated world of post-war British athletics. She started off in 1945 as Hon. Treasurer of Spartan Ladies and early in 1950, aged 29, she was elected Hon. Treasurer of the national governing body, the Women's AAA. She was appointed team manager of the British women's team for the Melbourne Olympic Games of 1956, holding this position until 1978, a period that encompassed five Olympic Games and a host of other important meetings including the European championships and the Commonwealth Games. In the 1950s female athletics had little or no media profile, and it is to Hartman's credit that she was able to secure sponsorship deals with a number of manufacturers of well-known brands, including Unilever products Bovril and Sunsilk. Hartman was insistent on equality for women athletes, arguing for their participation in a range of events that had previously been denied to them, and she successfully navigated the sometimes reactionary world of British amateur athletics with skill and sociability. In latter years some athletes saw her as a conservative figure, and in the late 1970s she and fellow sports administrator Arthur Gold were the subject of some fierce criticism from sections of the press primed by elements within British athletics.Obituary of Arthur Gold: The Independent 27 May 2002 It was essentially the new guard versus the old, with Hartman seen by some as part of the reactionary old guard.A Brief History of Handicaps- Tom McNab England Athletics East Region Coaching Journal Vol OneTom McNab, a contemporary coach refers to the old guard as the 'Blazerati' A Brief History of Handicaps- Tom McNab England Athletics East Region Coaching Journal Vol One Pierre de Coubertin's spirit of participation was a principle in which Hartman believed (she was never a paid official, carrying out her functions within the sport in an honorary capacity without remuneration), but once she realised that professionalism was not going away, she argued for equality for women athletes in the professional era. In her younger years she was well suited to her role as Team Manager, where she often had to reassure nervously strung international athletes. She was closely associated with the historic triumphs of Mary Rand and Ann Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. After Lillian Board, the 400-metre silver medalist at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Hartman was with Board in Munich shortly before she died in 1970. Hartman was instrumental in the setting up a memorial trophy, the Lillian Board Trophy, awarded each year for outstanding fundraising for cancer. Hartman was selected Chairwoman of the Women's Commission of the IAAF in 1968, a post she held until 1981. As Honorary Secretary of the Women's AAA she campaigned against the use of stimulants and performance-enhancing drugs, and was a founder member of the Drugs Abuse Sub-Committee as far back as 1968. When British athletics administration received a much needed overhaul in 1991, Hartman became President of the British Athletics Federation. She never married or had children.Dame Marea Hartman obituary, Independent Newspaper, London, 31 August 1994. Her nephew was the actor Douglas Fielding. Honours She was appointed MBE and later advanced to CBE, awards from her own country. In 1993 she was awarded the Prince Chichibu Award for her impact on women's athletics in Japan.The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography, Jennifer S. Uglow, Maggy Hendry, McMillian Press 4th edition (UK), (1994) She was named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1994 New Years Honours List; she died eight months later from undisclosed causes.

Biography =Playing career= Fuccillo was born in Bedford to Italian parents and joined Luton Town from school. He established himself in their starting line-up, and there was even talk of a call-up to the Italian national team. Disaster struck, however, when a tackle by Brighton and Hove Albion's Paul Clark shattered his leg. He broke his leg for a second time during his comeback match for the Luton youth team. He did manage, eventually, to regain his place in the team and played an important part as they won Second Division in 1982. In 1983 Fuccillo left Luton following a contractual dispute and played 19 games for the Tulsa Roughnecks in the North American Soccer League. Fuccillo then joined Southend United, before John Wile brought him to Peterborough United. He helped Posh get to the 5th round of the FA Cup in 1985/86, had a brief spell as caretaker manager in 1986/87 prior to Noel Cantwell's return to the club, but was released during the summer of 1987. He played briefly for Malta side Valletta before short spells at Cambridge United and Kettering Town. He finished his playing career at Isthmian League side Wivenhoe Town. =Coaching career= Chris Turner brought him back to Peterborough United in 1991 as his assistant manager, and had an unsuccessful spell as manager when Turner became chairman. He joined Barry Fry at Birmingham City as coach, and then moved back to Peterborough United to be his assistant. His third spell at Peterborough United did not last long, however, as Fry sacked both Fuccillo and coach Mick Halsall in December 1996 as an economy measure. Fuccillo had spells as a scout for Sheffield Wednesday and as John Still's right-hand man at Barnet, but in November 2000 he returned to Luton Town as a scout. A week later he was promoted to assistant manager, but, with the club at the foot of the league, Ricky Hill was sacked within weeks so Fuccillo then stepped up into the managerial seat. Following an unsuccessful reign, Joe Kinnear was brought to the club in February as Director of Football, but took it upon himself to replace Fuccillo as manager as well. Surprisingly, Fuccillo remained at Luton Town as a coach until the end of the season. Their third manager of the season, however, was unable to save the club and Luton were relegated to the basement division for the first time since 1968. During the summer of 2001 he joined United Counties League side Wootton Blue Cross as a coach for John Taylor, making an immediate impact with the team starting with a ten-match winning sequence. After a season Fuccillo linked up with Peterborough United for a fourth time as a scout, but again this spell did not last long as he moved to perform a similar role with Premiership side Everton, combined at the start with some part-time coaching at Taylor's new club St Neots Town. He was reunited once more with Taylor as he began the 2006‚Äì07 season as a coach at Isthmian League side Arlesey Town, but in November 2006 joined Leicester City as chief scout. On 21 March 2008, Lil Fucillo was appointed chief scout for Newcastle United. On 3 September 2009 he left Newcastle United to take up a similar position at Championship rivals Swansea City. On 23 March 2012 Luton Town announced that Fuccillo had returned to the club in the role of Technical Director, which he held until his departure in April 2013. Fuccillo was appointed as chief scout at League One side Crawley Town on 6 February 2014. References External links * *Profile at UpThePosh!

TGFBR1 is its human gene.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene forms a heteromeric complex with type II TGF-Œ≤ receptors when bound to TGF-Œ≤, transducing the TGF-Œ≤ signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. The encoded protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Loeys‚ÄìDietz aortic aneurysm syndrome (LDS, LDAS).

Inhibitors * GW-788,388 * LY-2109761 * Galunisertib (LY-2157299) * SB-431,542 * SB-525,334  Animal studies  Defects are observed when the TGFBR-1 gene is either knocked-out or when a constitutively active TGFBR-1 mutant (that is active in the presence or absence of ligand) is knocked-in. In mouse TGFBR-1 knock-out models, the female mice were sterile. They developed oviductal diverticula and defective uterine smooth muscle, meaning that uterine smooth muscle layers were poorly formed. Oviductal diverticula are small, bulging pouches located on the oviduct, which is the tube that transports the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. This deformity of the oviduct occurred bilaterally and resulted in impaired embryo development and impaired transit of the embryos to the uterus. Ovulation and fertilization still occurred in the knock-outs, however remnants of embryos were found in these oviductal diverticula. In mouse TGFBR-1 knock-in models where a constitutively active TGFBR-1 gene is conditionally induced, the over- activation of the TGFBR-1 receptors lead to infertility, a reduction in the number of uterine glands, and hypermuscled uteri (an increased amount of smooth muscle in the uteri). These experiments show that the TGFB-1 receptor plays a critical role in the function of the female reproductive tract. They also show that genetic mutations in the TGFBR-1 gene may lead to fertility issues in women.

The park was founded in 1869, on land that was given to the city by residents of the neighborhood. The park is known as \\"The Jewel of the City\\" for its dramatic elevated view of Providence's \\"downcity.\\" Author and Providence native H. P. Lovecraft frequently visited the park. History A statue of theologian Roger Williams (designed by architect Ralph Thomas Walker) was built in the late 1930s after Williams' descendant Stephen Randall made a deed of gift for the monument. It was dedicated on 29 June 1939. The approximate 15-foot tall granite statue commemorates Williams' founding of the state of Rhode Island and his promotion for religious freedom, and the statue depicts Williams gazing over the city. In 1939, Roger Williams' remains were moved into a tomb that lies directly beneath the statue. His body had been overgrown by the roots of an apple tree next to his original grave. The roots grew over the form of his body so that it looked similar to a human form. The remainder of his bones were reburied in a bronze casket and placed beneath his statue in Prospect Terrace. The so- called \\"Williams Root\\" is preserved and is now on display at the John Brown House Museum on the East Side of Providence. In 2006, vandals removed all five fingers of the statue's left hand, along with the thumb of his right hand. The damage was repaired in 2010. In December 2016, efforts were started by the College Hill Neighborhood Association to raise funds for improvements and restoration to the park. New benches, signs, and landscaping, were planned. Previously, the park had not been renovated for 28 years. The view Admiring the view Prospect Terrace Park attracts visitors and locals alike for its panoramic view of the city. From the elevated location of the park, one can see many of Providence's most prominent landmarks, from Providence Place Mall to the Rhode Island State House to the Meeting House of the First Baptist Church in America. The park's west-facing view makes it ideal for taking in the sunset.

He finished them just before he was incarcerated. The Home Secretary, Lord Balfour, gave the extraordinary instruction that the prisoner should be allowed writing materials in this cell, in which he produced his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, published in 1919. Russell, together with Balfour, L. T. Hobhouse, Samuel Alexander, Harold Laski, and the Institute's Journal's first editor, Sydney Hooper, founded the Institute, originally known as the British Institute of Philosophical Studies, in 1925. The first President of the Institute was Lord Balfour, succeeded in 1930 by Lord Samuel, in 1959 by Lord Halsbury, in 1991 by Anthony Quinton, and in 2006 by Sir Anthony Kenny. Sir Anthony, the current President, has been Master of Balliol College, Oxford and President of the British Academy. He is author of many philosophical books and articles, and he gave the Institute‚Äôs Annual Lecture in 2007. Sir David Ross was for many years Chairman of Council, and Professor Hywel Lewis for many years after him. He was succeeded by the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of London, Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood.

It features the Tenth Doctor and Martha. This paperback is part of the Quick Reads Initiative sponsored by the UK government, to encourage literacy. It has a similar look to BBC Books' other new series adventures, except for its much shorter word count, being a paperback and not being numbered as part of the same series. To date it is the one of only five novels based upon the revived series that have not been published in hardcover: the first, I am a Dalek, was published in May 2006; the third, Revenge of the Judoon, was published in March 2008; the fourth, The Sontaran Games, was published in February 2009; and the fifth, Code of the Krillitanes, was published in March 2010. These four books are also part of the Quick Reads Initiative. Plot Returning from the Cretaceous period, The Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones journey to the present day, where Cybermen have been teleporting into labs and stealing technology. The Doctor takes Martha back to the Royal Hope hospital, where they have a confrontation with a pair of Cybermen in the car park. After nearly being captured, the Cybermen suddenly disappear, due to faults with their unfamiliar teleportation technology. The Army also want to get their hands on the Doctor, and ask for his help, so the Army capture him and his TARDIS from the Royal Hope Hospital, and he is separated from Martha. At the Army Base, the Doctor realises that the Cybermen who were made on Earth, not the parallel universe (and were therefore not sucked into the void) having been using teleportion devices stolen from the Torchwood building, to help them gather enough technology to create a portal capable of reopening The Void and release the Cybermen trapped inside. But the Cybermen do not know how to open the Void, and so they need the Doctor to open it for them. That's why they're trying to capture him alive. While Martha is separated from the Doctor, the Cybermen reappear, and capture her. They take her to their secret base where they discuss whether or not to kill her. Soon, the Doctor phones her on her mobile, and lets slip where he is. Just as Martha is about to tell him where she is, the Cyberleader snatches her phone and destroys it, then plans an attack on the Army Base where the Doctor is being held. The Doctor manages to figure out that the Cybermen are at the Millennium Dome. But a team of 6 Cybermen (who were being kept frozen since the battle of Canary Wharf) attacks the base. The Army manages to destroy all but the Cyberleader with special weapons they had prepared in case Cybermen should invade again. The Cyberleader tells the Doctor that they'll kill Martha unless he helps them, then vanishes. The Doctor and the Army plan to attack the Millennium Dome. Having retrieved his TARDIS from the base, the Doctor manages to materialize right inside the Dome but the Army cannot enter due to a force-field set up by the Cybermen. The Doctor cooperates with the remaining two Cybermen & the Cyberleader, and opens their portal by linking up their equipment to the TARDIS. But the Cybermen realize that the Doctor's methods do not work, and the force-field does not lead to the Void. Instead, it leads to Prehistoric Earth. A Tyrannosaurus rex appears and kills two Cybermen. Martha damages the force-field generator, and the Doctor uses an electrical cord from it to fry the Cyberleader. The portal then closes. With the Army entering too late, the Doctor and Martha say good-bye, then leave in the TARDIS to go somewhere 'peaceful'. Publication This is the first New Series Adventure to be written by Terrance Dicks, who has written books for all previous lines of Doctor Who fiction with the exception of the Telos Doctor Who novellas. Dicks served as script editor for the original Doctor Who series in the early 1970s and contributed many teleplays, and was prolific in novelizing serials for Target Books, serving also as editor for the line.

At the time of her death, she was professor emerita of zoology and honorary professor of anatomy with radiology at the University of Auckland. Early life, family and education Born Patricia Rose Smyth in the Auckland suburb of Devonport on 10 March 1933, Bergquist was the daughter of William Smyth, an electrician, and Bertha Ellen Smyth (n√©e Penny), a homemaker. She was educated at Devonport Primary School, and then Takapuna Grammar School where she was dux in her final year. She then began studying at Auckland University College in 1950, graduating MSc with first-class honours in botany in 1956; the title of her master's thesis was Contributions to the study of the loxsomaceae. After completing a second MSc equivalent in zoology, she undertook doctoral studies at Auckland, obtaining her PhD, supervised by William Roy McGregor and John Morton, on the taxonomy of the Porifera in 1961. Bergquist was the first person to earn a doctoral degree from the University of Auckland. In 1958, she married Peter Bergquist, a noted molecular biologist, and the couple went on to have one daughter. Academic and research career Following her doctorate, Patricia Bergquist studied overseas, initially at Yale University where she broadened her systematic expertise, before returning to New Zealand and becoming an educator and researcher at the University of Auckland on matters related to anatomy, taxonomy and zoology, with particular interest in the marine sponge. She felt a stable framework of higher level classification which would permit recognition of generic relationships and facilitate descriptions of new species was missing. When Bergquist received a Personal Chair at the University of Auckland, she was the first woman at that university to do so. She co-authored (with Mary E. Sinclair) The Morphology and Behaviour of Larvae of Some Intertidal Sponges for the New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, which was published on 20 October 1967. In 1979, Bergquist was conferred with the degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Auckland, on the basis on 28 submitted publications. Honours and awards Bergquist was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1982, and in 1989 she was awarded the Hector Memorial Medal by the Royal Society of New Zealand. In the 1994 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to science. Her husband, Peter Bergquist, was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to science, in the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours. Bergquist featured as one of the Royal Society of New Zealand's \\"150 women in 150 words\\" project in 2017.

The revolution, which occurred at the same time as revolutions in France and Li√®ge, led to the brief overthrow of Habsburg rule and the proclamation of a short-lived polity, the United Belgian States. The revolution was the product of opposition which emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. These were perceived as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions in the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance, focused in the autonomous and wealthy Estates of Brabant and Flanders, grew. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption in 1787, known as the Small Revolution, many dissidents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Li√®ge revolutions, this √©migr√© army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout in October 1789. The rebels, supported by uprisings across the territory, soon took control over virtually all the Southern Netherlands and proclaimed independence. Despite the tacit support of Prussia, the independent United Belgian States, established in January 1790, received no foreign recognition and the rebels soon became divided along ideological lines. The Vonckists, led by Jan Frans Vonck, advocated progressive and liberal government, whereas the Statists, led by Henri Van der Noot, were staunchly conservative and supported by the Church. The Statists, who had a wider base of support, soon drove the Vonckists into exile through a terror. By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria ended its war with the Ottoman Empire and prepared to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. Because of its distinctive course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, have seen it as a key moment in the formation of a Belgian nation- state, and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Background and causes =Austrian rule= Map of the Austrian Netherlands in the 1780s. The territory was not contiguous and was bisected by the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge and tiny Duchy of Bouillon The Austrian Netherlands was a territory with its capital at Brussels which covered much of what is today Belgium and Luxembourg during the Early Modern period. In 1714, the territory, which had been ruled by Spain, was ceded to Austria as part of the Treaty of Rastatt which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. In the 1580s, the Dutch Revolt had separated the independent Dutch Republic from the rest of the territory, leaving the Austrian Netherlands with a staunchly Catholic population. The clergy maintained substantial power. The Austrian Netherlands were both a province of Habsburg Austria and a part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1764, Joseph II, was elected as Holy Roman Emperor, ruling over a loosely unified federation of autonomous territories within Central Europe roughly equivalent to modern-day Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria. Joseph's mother, Maria Theresa, had appointed her favourite daughter, Maria Christina, and her husband, Albert Casimir, as joint Governors of the Austrian Netherlands in 1780. Both Joseph and Maria Theresa were considered reformists and were particularly interested in the idea of enlightened absolutism. Joseph II, who was known as the philosopher-emperor (empereur philosophe), had a particular interest in Enlightenment thought and had his own ideology which has sometimes been termed \\"Josephinism\\" after him. Joseph particularly disliked institutions which he considered \\"outdated\\", such as the established ultramontane Church whose allegiance to the papacy prevented the Emperor from having total control, which restricted efficient and centralist rule. Soon after taking power, in 1781, Joseph launched a low-key tour of inspection of the Austrian Netherlands during which he concluded reform in the territory was badly needed. Politically, the Austrian Netherlands comprised a number of federated and autonomous territories, inherited from the Spanish, which could trace their lineage to the Middle Ages. These territories, known collectively as the Provincial States, retained much of their traditional power over their own internal affairs. The states were dominated by the wealthy and prominent Estates of Brabant and Flanders. The Austrian Governors-General were forced to respect the autonomy of the provincial states and could only act with some degree of consent. Within the states themselves, the \\"traditional\\" independence was considered extremely important and figures such as Jan- Baptist Verlooy had even begun to claim the linguistic unity of Flemish dialects as a sign of national identity in what is now Flanders. =Reforms of Joseph II= Maria Christina and Albert Casimir of Teschen, joint Governors- General of the Austrian Netherlands from 1780 to 1793 Propelled by his belief in the Enlightenment, soon after taking power, Joseph launched a number of reforms which he hoped would make the territories he controlled more efficient and easier to govern. From 1784, Joseph launched a number of \\"radical and wide-ranging\\" reforms in the fields of economics, politics and religion aimed at institutions which he judged outdated. Some have drawn parallels between Joseph's rule in the Holy Roman Empire and that of Philip II in the Netherlands as both attempted to suborn local traditions in order to achieve more effective central rule. Like Philip, Joseph's perceived attacks on important institutions succeeded in uniting multiple divergent social classes against him. His initial reforms were aimed at the Catholic church which, because of its allegiance to the Vatican, was viewed a potentially subversive force. Joseph's first act was the proclamation of the Edict of Tolerance of 1781‚Äì82 which abolished the privileges which Catholics enjoyed over other Christian and non-Christian minorities. As an attack on the place of the church, it was deeply unpopular among Catholics, but because the non-Catholics were a tiny minority, it did not win any real support. The Edict was condemned by Cardinal Frankenberg who insisted that religious tolerance, the relaxation of censorship and the suppression of laws against the Jansenists all constituted an attack on the Catholic Church. Later, 162 monasteries whose inhabitants led a purely contemplative life were abolished. In September 1784, marriage was made a civil, rather than a religious, institution. This sharply reduced the church's traditional influence and power in its parishioners' family lives. Following this, in October 1786, the government abolished all seminaries in the territory to establish a single, state-run General Seminary (seminarium generale) in Leuven. Within the General Seminary, training would be in liberal and state-approved theology which was opposed by the upper ranks of the clergy. Gold medallion depicting Emperor Joseph II whose reforms sparked the revolt In December 1786, he followed up his belief in liberalisation and earlier attacks on guild privileges by removing all tariffs on grain trade, but this was revoked in the economic slump that soon followed. Replaced local charity or poor-relief organisations with a single, central Brotherhood of Active Charity in April 1786. Schools were reformed. Above all, however, Joseph attempted to break up the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more centralised system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500‚Äì58) were replaced by a single General Council of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much of the power of the states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a centralised system similar to that already in place in Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts. By threatening the independence of the states, the interests of the nobility and the position of the church, the reforms acted as a force to unite these groups against the Austrian government. =Opposition and the Small Revolution= The patriots chose the colours of Brabant (red, yellow and black) for their cockade. This would later influence the Belgian flag created in 1830. Joseph's reforms were deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, and it was widely distrusted as a foreign phenomenon which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms to be a threat to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Henri Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region. Discontent crystallised into a wave of uprisings and rioting known as the Small Revolution (Kleine Revolutie) of 1787. The revolution was suppressed by levying the civil militias but it alarmed the Governors-General and opposition grew. The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support. The allegiance of the civil militias, who were already beginning to call themselves Patriots (Patriotten), was uncertain. Fearing for the security of the regime, the Governors-General temporarily suspended the reforms without the Emperor's permission on 20 May 1787. They invited all aggrieved parties to express their opposition and grievances in petitions but this merely inflamed the regime's critics. The Emperor himself was furious and recalled his minister, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso. Alarmed by the level of unrest, Joseph eventually agreed to repeal his reforms to the judicial system and governance but left his clerical reforms in place. He hoped that, by removing the grievances of the states and middle classes, the opposition would become divided and would be easily suppressed. He also appointed a new Minister Plenipotentiary to oversee the province. The concession did not stop the opposition growing, inspired and funded by the Catholic clergy, which became especially notable at the University of Leuven. Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands decided that the only way in which reform could be provoked would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some states had already begun to refuse payment of taxes to the Austrian authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of Hainaut and Brabant were disbanded. =Growth of organised resistance and the √©migr√©s= Portrait of Jan Frans Vonck, who led the liberal resistance to the Austrians In the aftermath of the suppression of the Small Revolution, opposition began to consolidate into more organised resistance. Fearing for his safety, Van der Noot, the organiser of the disruption of 1787, went into exile in the Dutch Republic where he tried to lobby support from William V. Van der Noot attempted to persuade William to support the overthrow of the Austrian regime and install his son, Frederick, as Stadtholder of a Belgian republic. However, William was suspicious and expressed little interest in Van der Noot's proposal. None of the political factions in Dutch society proclaimed support for similar proposal. Nevertheless, Van der Noot was able to set up a headquarters in the city of Breda, near the Dutch-Belgian border, where an √©migr√© faction grew. The Dutch population also remained broadly sympathetic towards the patriots. As disquiet in the Austrian Netherlands grew, thousands of Flemish and Brabant dissidents fled into the Dutch Republic to join the growing patriot army at Breda although the force remained relatively small. Inside the Austrian Netherlands themselves, the lawyers Jan Frans Vonck and Verlooy formed a secret society called Pro Aris et Focis in April or May 1789 in order to plan for an armed uprising against Austrian rule. Weapons and revolutionary tracts were distributed. Most of the members of the organisation came from the liberal professions (such as lawyers, writers and merchants). Most were moderates who did not object to Joseph II's reforms in principle but because they had been levied on the territories without consultation. They were supported financially by the clergy. Initially members of the opposition were divided on how the uprising should occur. Unlike Van der Noot, Vonck believed that Belgium should liberate itself rather than rely on foreign aid. With the support of the Belgian clergy, all the opposition factions (including Van der Noot) agreed to unite and a Brabant Patriot Committee (Brabants patriottisch Comit√©) was formed in Hasselt. On 30 August, Pro Aris et Focis voted to install Jean-Andr√© van der Mersch (or Vandermersch), a retired military officer, as the commander of the √©migr√© army in Breda. The Committee agreed that the rebellion should begin in October 1789. Revolution In the spring of 1789, a revolution broke out in France against the Bourbon regime of King Louis XVI. In August 1789, the inhabitants of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge also overthrew their tyrannical Prince- Bishop, C√©sar-Constantin-Fran√ßois de Hoensbroeck, in a bloodless coup d'√©tat known as the \\"Happy Revolution\\" (Heureuse r√©volution). Contemporaries viewed the uprising in Li√®ge, which was also inspired by Enlightenment ideas, as a symptom of revolutionary \\"contagion\\" from France. In the face of a rebellion proclaiming the ideas of liberty and equality, the Prince-Bishop soon fled to the neighboring Archbishopric of Trier and the revolutionaries proclaimed a republic in Li√®ge. =Invasion= A rebel soldier at the Battle of Turnhout, painted in 1902 by Th√©ophile Lybaert The Brabant Revolution broke out on 24 October 1789 when the √©migr√© patriot army under Van der Mersch crossed over the Dutch border into the Austrian Netherlands. The army, which numbered 2,800 men, crossed into the Kempen region south of Breda. The army arrived in the town of Hoogstraten where a specially prepared document, the Manifesto of the People of Brabant (Manifeste du peuple braban√ßon), was read in the city hall. The document denounced Joseph II's rule and declared that he no longer held legitimacy. The text of the speech itself was an embellished version of the 1581 declaration (the Verlatinge) by the Dutch States-General denouncing Philip II's rule in the Netherlands. On 27 October, the patriot army clashed with a much-larger Austrian force at the nearby town of Turnhout. The ensuing battle was a triumph for the outnumbered rebels and the Austrians suffered a \\"shameful defeat\\". The rebel triumph broke the back of the Austrian forces in Belgium and many local soldiers within the Austrian force deserted to the patriot cause. Swelled by new recruits and supported by the population, the patriot army advanced rapidly into Flanders. On 16 November, Flander's major city, Ghent, was taken after four days of fighting and the Estate of Flanders proclaimed support for the rebel cause. The rebel armies penetrated further into the territory, defeating Austrian forces in a number of small skirmishes, and captured the town of Mons on 21 November. By December, the Austrian force, fully routed, withdrew to the fortified city of Luxembourg in the south, abandoning the rest of the territory to the patriots. Historians have pointed to the deliberate parallels between the entrance of the rebel army into the Austrian Netherlands in 1789 and Louis of Nassau's invasion of Frisia in 1566 which acted as the trigger for the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule. =United Belgian States= With fall of the Austrian regime, the revolutionaries were forced to decide what form a new revolutionary state would take. Figures within revolutionary France, such as Jacques Pierre Brissot, praised their work and encouraged them to declare their own national independence in the spirit of the American Revolution. On 30 November, a Declaration of Unity was signed between Flanders and the Brabant states. On 20 December, an actual declaration of independence was signed proclaiming the end of Austrian rule and the independence of the states. After the rebel capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began on a new constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a traditional assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new state would take. Its 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state would not be able to act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region. On 11 January 1790, the United Belgian States (√âtat-Belgiques-Unis or Verenigde Belgische Staten) was officially formed with a Treaty of Union. After negotiations, the delegates decided that the states should be unified into a single polity. A Sovereign Congress was created in Brussels which would act as a parliament for the whole union. Autonomy over almost all important matters, however, was still decided independently by the states themselves. =Growing divisions and factionalism= Silver Lion (Lion d'Argent), minted by the rebels in 1790 Soon after its establishment, the politics of the United Belgian States became polarised between two opposing factions. The first faction, known as the Vonckists after their leader Vonck, was a \\"more or less liberal reform party\\" which believed the revolution represented the triumph of popular sovereignty. They derived much of their support from the liberal middle classes and hoped that the revolution would allow their supporters to achieve political power traditionally monopolised by the clergy and aristocracy. Most had not disagreed with Joseph's reforms in principal, but believed that the way in which they had been implemented was arbitrary and showed disregard for his subjects. Traditionally, much of the Vonckists' support was based in Flanders which was considered more liberal than Brabant. Opposed to the Vonckists were the more conservative Statists (sometimes also known as \\"Aristocrats\\"), led by Van der Noot. The Statists had a broader base of support than the Vonckists and were particularly supported by the clergy, lower classes, nobility and the feudal corporations. The Statists viewed the revolution as a purely reactive measure to reforms which they considered unacceptable. Most Statists supported the maintenance of traditional aristocratic privilege and the position of the Church. Virgin Mary, preserved in the Royal Museum of the Army The two factions soon clashed over the composition of the provincial assemblies which was \\"a conflict of which no peaceful solution existed\\" in the constitution. The Statists accused the Vonckists of sharing the same views as the radicals of the French Revolution. The Statists succeeded in gaining support in a number of Patriotic Associations (Patriottische Maatschappij), similar to the \\"clubs\\" of Revolutionary France, which were composed of members of the wealthy classes. By March 1790, the Vonckists had been forced out of Brussels by a mob. An armed \\"crusade\\" of peasants, carrying crucifixes and led by priests, marched on Brussels in June to confirm their support of the Statists and to display rejection of the Enlightenment. Influenced by the growing power of the radicals in France, the mob believed that the Vonckists were anti-clerical although this was probably untrue. With the support of the population, Van der Noot launched a persecution of Vonckists known as the Statist Terror (Statistisch Schrikbewind). Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists felt that they had more to gain from negotiating with the Austrians than with the Statists. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their faith in a foreign military intervention and began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to be sympathetic, for support. =Suppression= The Battle of Falmagne of September 1790 was one of the few battles fought between Austrian and Statist forces Just months after its proclamation, in December 1789, the Li√®ge Republic was condemned by the Austrians, and was occupied by troops from neighbouring Prussia. Disagreements between the Prussians and the Prince- Bishop about the form a restoration would take led to a Prussian withdrawal and the revolutionaries soon took power again. Initially, the Brabant Revolution was also able to continue unthreatened because of the lack of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion. The magistrates of Brussels offer the city's surrender to the Austrian army of Blasius Columban, Baron von Bender on 2 December 1790 Realising that foreign support would be necessary for the continued existence of the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure. Joseph died in February 1790 and was soon succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Leopold, himself a confirmed liberal, made an armistice with the Turks and withdrew 30,000 troops to repress the rebellion in Brabant. On 27 July 1790, Leopold signed the Reichenbach Convention with Prussia which allowed the Emperor to begin the reconquest of the Austrian Netherlands as long as its local traditions were respected. An amnesty was offered to all revolutionaries who surrendered to the Austrian forces. The Austrian army, under Field Marshal Blasius Columban, Baron von Bender, invaded in the United Belgian States and encountered little resistance from the population which was already discontented with the governance and infighting of the rebels. The Austrians defeated the Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne on 28 September. Hainaut was the first to recognise Leopold's sovereignty and other cities soon followed. Namur was captured on 24 November. The Sovereign Congress met for the final time on 27 November before disbanding itself. On 3 December, the Austrians accepted the surrender of Brussels and reoccupied the city, effectively marking the suppression of the revolution. Aftermath In the aftermath of the defeat of the United Belgian States, a convention was held at The Hague on 10 December 1790 to decide what form the Austrian reestablishment would take. The Convention, which included representatives of the Emperor and the Triple Alliance of the Dutch, British and Prussians, eventually decided to cancel most of Joseph II's reforms. Despite the Austrian reestablishment, anti-government pamphleting continued. The Dutch radical Gerrit Paape published his detailed observations on the uprising and observed that a new revolution was needed in which the \\"happiness and freedom of peoples\\" were respected. The Li√®ge Revolution was also finally suppressed by Austrian forces in January 1791 and its Prince-Bishop reinstated. =French invasion= The advance of the French revolutionary army at the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 The exiled Vonckists in France embraced the French invasion of the territory as the only way to implement their own objectives, largely forgetting the nationalist dimension of their original ideologies. After the two Belgian revolutions were crushed, a number of Brabant and Li√®ge revolutionaries regrouped in Paris, where they formed the joint Committee of United Belgians and Li√©geois (Comit√© des belges et li√©geois unis), which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time. Three Belgian corps and a Li√®ge Legion were levied to continue the fight for the French against the Austrians. The War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797) was the first major effort of multiple European monarchies to defeat Revolutionary France. France declared war on Austria in April 1792, and the Kingdom of Prussia joined the Austrian side a few weeks later. France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Li√®ge, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial d√©partements within France. French rule in the region, known as the French period (Franse tijd or p√©riode fran√ßaise), was marked by the rapid implementation and extension of numerous reforms which had been passed in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organised under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced. =Legacy= After the defeat of the French in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Belgium came under Dutch rule. The Belgian Revolution, which broke out on 25 August 1830 after the performance of a nationalist opera in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, was inspired to some extent by the Brabant Revolution. The day after the revolution broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant Revolution of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence. Historical analysis The Brabant Revolution has been extensively used for historical comparisons with other revolutions of the time. The leading Belgian historian, Henri Pirenne, contrasted the Brabant Revolution, which he termed \\"defensive\\" or \\"conservative\\", with the more enlightened uprisings in France and Li√®ge in his Histoire de Belgique series. Other historians have agreed, commenting that the Brabant revolutionaries had an ideology which was deliberately opposed to the Enlightened and Democratic vision of the French Revolutionaries. The historians Jacques Godechot and Robert Roswell Palmer characterised the ideology of the French revolutionaries as founded on beliefs in the \\"enlightenment\\" and \\"national consciousness\\". Palmer argued for similarities between the Brabant Revolution and the counter-revolutionary activities of pre-revolutionary institutions, like the guilds and the aristocracy, in France which were ultimately defeated and abolished. Some historians have similarly drawn parallels between the Brabant Revolution and the French counter- revolutions in the Vend√©e. Other historians, like E. H. Kossmann, have noted similarities between the uprising and the Dutch Revolt. It has also been argued that the Brabant Revolution might form part of the same Europe-wide \\"crisis of the ancien r√©gime\\" which sparked the French Revolution. Statue of Van der Mersch in the Belgian city of Menen Pirenne, a nationalist himself, argued that the Brabant Revolution was a very important influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and can be seen as an early expression of Belgian nationalism. Pirenne praised the revolution as a unification of Flemish and Walloons. He also argued that the Vonckists and Statists could be seen as the forerunners of the major political factions of Belgium post-independence, the Liberals and Catholics, and expressed sympathy with the Vonckists. Pirenne, as a liberal, could only explain the defeat of the Vonckists by playing up the economic and social backwardness of the Austrian Netherlands. He supported this viewpoint by emphasizing the disgust seen in traveler's tales written by \\"enlightened\\" German observers. This has been criticised by modern historians, like J. Craeybeckx, who argue that France was no more socially or economically advanced than the Austrian Netherlands at the time. Conceptually, the Brabant Revolution has generally been seen as a \\"revolution from above\\", based on the defense of existing privileges and the upper classes and clergy rather than the proletariat. Kossmann argued that, while it was Vonck who began the revolution, it was Van der Noot who was best able to shape it. In his belief, this was because Vonck was able to rally mass support against the Austrians, but not in support of his own policies unlike Van der Noot. It has also been argued that the revolution's ideology was framed in direct opposition to the democratic and liberal revolutions in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the German states.

History It was founded as Rhode Island Junior College, \\"RIJC\\", in 1964 with 325 students studying at the Henry Barnard School in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1965, a portion of the nearby former Brown & Sharpe manufacturing facility was converted into classroom space and served as the college's primary facility until 1972. The Knight campus in Warwick, RI built on the donated Knight Estate, opened in 1972 as the school's first permanent building and flagship campus. It was followed by three additional campus and 2 satellite locations. The Margaret M. Jacoby Observatory, located on the Knight Campus grounds, was opened in 1978.

The campus was designed to house all academic, social, and recreational functions in a single building. The building itself is an enormous concrete structure which terminates in a semicircle, and ranges in height from four to six stories. The design is a notable example of Brutalist architecture, and was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Le Corbusier. The building was hailed by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission as \\"one of the most striking and innovative contemporary structures in the state\\" when it opened in 1972. Over time, the Brutalist style generally lost its appeal and became seen as \\"drab,\\" \\"hulking,\\" and \\"bureaucratic,\\" associated with large-scale mass-planning. In 2019, the Knight campus building made local news after being named \\"eighth ugliest college campus in the United States\\" by a lifestyle blog.  Organization and administration  The college president is Meghan Hughes.  Academic profile  The college offers the following degrees: *Associate in Arts (A.A.) *Associate in Science (A.S.) *Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) *Associate in Applied Science in Technical Studies (A.A.S.-T.S.) *Associate in Fine Arts (A.F.A.)

The Mission's flagship program is Basics Banks, a network of eight partner church-based food banks throughout Edinburgh and in Musselburgh. The Basics Banks provide resources for people who are struggling to afford basic necessities. Edinburgh City Mission helped found the Care Van in association with Bethany Christian Trust in 1990 and continues to partner with Bethany in managing the Care Van and with forty Edinburgh churches who provide volunteer teams to run the van 363 evenings a year. History Edinburgh City Mission was founded on 1 March, 1832 by David Nasmith, six years after the founding of the first City Mission in the world, Glasgow City Mission. The Mission has formerly been active in various forms of evangelism, including street evangelism, setting up special events, and was known for its work in the poorer, deprived areas of the city through Mission Halls and Drop-In Centres. The Mission also used to run The Christian Heritage Centre and hosted Celtic Tours on the Royal Mile. The Christian Heritage Centre recently became an independent charity in its own right but still maintains close ties to the Mission. In the last few years, Edinburgh City Mission has developed partnerships with churches across the city. They have recently developed new partnerships: running church-based CAP Life Skills courses and providing debt support in partnership with the Salvation Army. In summer 2017, the trustees appointed Duncan Cuthill as its new CEO.

Philibert Orry, count of Vignory and lord of La Chapelle-Godefroy (born in Troyes on 22 January 1689 ‚Äì died at La Chapelle-Godefroy on 9 November 1747), was a French statesman. Life The fifth child of Jean Orry, a leading economist, Philibert Orry served as a cavalry captain during the War of Spanish Succession, before becoming a member of the Parlement of Paris, then master of requests in 1715. He was an intendant in Lille (1715-1718), Soissons (1722-1727), and Roussillon (1727-1728). Orry was named Controller-General of Finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the B√¢timents du Roi (\\"the king's buildings\\") in 1736, after the death of the duc d'Antin. Orry remained Controller-General until 1745, making him the longest continuously- serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century. An able economist, Orry had to restore the dixi√®me (\\"tenth\\") tax and declared the venality of municipal officials, successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40. Applying the principles of Colbert, he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper, and was involved in the production of porcelain in Vincennes in 1740. He supported trade with Canada and the Indies by reforming the statutes of the Compagnie des Indes. As director general of buildings, he established the bi-annual public Paris Salon, and became the vice-protecteur of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (\\"Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture\\") in April 1737. His directorship has, generally, been harshly judged. The marquis d'Argenson spoke with contempt of \\"the bad, bourgeois taste of Monsieur Orry\\". However, Orry's selection of Charles-Joseph Natoire in 1730 to decorate his ch√¢teau de La Chapelle-Godefroy (see below) reveals, on the contrary, a certain discernement in artistic matters: Natoire was one of the most promising young history painters, and his two main rivals - Fran√ßois Boucher and Carle Van Loo - were both abroad. As director general of Ponts et Chauss√©es (bridges and highways), Orry finished the Crozat canal and maintained and developed France's road system. He sent to the intendants, in 1738, a detailed instruction on the duty (la corv√©e royale) for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes, classed in five categories. The corv√©e made France's major road network the finest in Europe, and before the Revolution, a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution. This policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the Cassini map in 1744.Colin Jones, The Great Nation (London, 2003), p. 115. . Facing opposition from Madame de Pompadour, Orry resigned in 1745. He was the Treasurer of the Order of the Holy Spirit from February 1743 to his death in 1747. Residences Orry owned the ch√¢teau de La Chapelle-Godefroy in Saint-Aubin near Nogent-sur- Seine, inherited from his father in 1719. \\"M. Orry\\", wrote the duc de Luynes in his M√©moires, \\"has always appeared to have no ambition, always regretting not being able to live on his estate, near Nogent, and always ready to go there with pleasure.\\" He transformed and expanded considerably the seigneurial estate. He owned two paintings by Jean-Antoine Watteau, the Enchanteur and the 'Aventuri√®re, which today are in the mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Troyes. Orry also possessed an estate, Petit Bercy, in Paris.

The station was designed by architect Thure Hellstr√∂m from the VR Group and built in 1935. Because of the depression in the 1930s, the station did not get a third floor, neither did it get a tower, as the Tampere railway station did. The plan of the station is rectangular and it has two floors. It is built of dark brown brick. In 2006, the station was renovated. The ticket office was moved from the east side of the corridor to the west side, and the storage lockers and R-kioski were removed from there, so that the ticket office is on the right-hand side when entering the station. The station restaurant is still in its original place on the east side of the station. The station platforms and the underpass tunnel of the west side of Vesij√§rvenkatu were also renovated. The renovation intended to make the station more efficient, when the more direct track from Helsinki to Lahti was opened on 1 September 2006.

Services =Commuter trains= Lahti is a terminus for two lines on the Helsinki commuter rail network: to Helsinki and to Riihim√§ki. It is also one end of the unnamed commuter rail line to Kouvola, which merges with line Z at points: on weekdays, two commuter trains leave Kouvola in the early morning and proceed to Helsinki via Lahti. This service is also operated in the direction Helsinki‚ÄìKouvola once at late at night on weekdays, as well as in the direction Kouvola‚ÄìHelsinki on weekend middays. Additionally, several of the Lahti‚ÄìKouvola commuter services are operated all the way from or continue towards Kotka as well. =Long-distance trains= As one of the termini of the Kerava‚ÄìLahti railway, all eastbound long-distance services from and to Helsinki stop at Lahti. After making a stop in Kouvola, these services then diverge to either the Kouvola‚ÄìIisalmi line towards Kuopio, or on the Kouvola‚ÄìJoensuu line towards Imatra or Joensuu. =International trains= Lahti is served by both of the services operated between Finland and Russia: night train Tolstoy between Helsinki and Moscow, and high-speed train Allegro between Helsinki and St. Petersburg.

Running late to audience day, he discovers his position has been temporarily taken over by his rival Kausirn, and that Joroiran is none too happy about his tardiness. Hastily creating the excuse that he was searching for the mythical 'Chalice of Death', he thinks he is out of trouble, only to discover that now Joroiran expects him to set off with fellow Earthman Domrik Carso in a quest to find it. The Earthmen change their quest and decide to search for the even more mythical Earth instead.

Born in London and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a young boy he was already, in his words, a \\"wireless fanatic\\": he said, \\"I was able to listen proudly to the debut of the BBC on 14 November 1922, and from the moment I heard the announcer say \\"This is 2LO calling, 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company\\", I was seized with an ambition to have a job like his.\\" During his university vacation in 1928 he got a job as announcer on a \\"broadcasting yacht\\" sponsored by the Daily Mail newspaper group. This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s \\"pirate radio\\" ships.. The broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain Leonard F. Plugge, who was starting the International Broadcasting Company (IBC).Stephen Williams, \\"Pioneering commercial radio the D-I-Y way\\", European Journal of Marketing, October 1987. (journal title and date wrongly cited on web page). At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.Roy Plomley, Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster, London, 1980, p.123. Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.Sean Street, \\"Radio For Sale: Sponsored Programming in British Radio during the 1930s\\", in Sound Journal, Bournemouth University, 1999. Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created Radio Luxembourg, where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.Williams, op. cit. In December 1933 Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station. Shortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in The Historic Record and AV Collector, Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June & October 1996.Sean Street, \\"Recording Technologies and Strategies for British Radio Transmission Before the 2nd World War\\", in Sound Journal, Bournemouth University, 2002. Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster. When, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, \\"Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye\\" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air \\"This is Radio Luxembourg\\" over 58 years earlier.\\"Last hours on 208m\\", aircheck available at playlist No 40 on The Station of the Stars: Audio Archive.

In its non-commercial form it is often called pencil cricket as in pre-war Britain six-sided pencils, shaved back to bare wood with the numbers and words written on them, were used. Today the game is supplied by a variety of manufacturers, including William Lindop Ltd. The name is derived from a verbal cricket appeal regarding whether a batsman is out. The game The game is usually played between two players, but can be played alone. It is played with two six-sided long dice and a paper scorecard. One die, the batting die, is labelled 1,2,3,4, 'owzthat' and 6. The second die, the umpire die, is labelled 'bowled', 'stumped', 'caught', 'not out', 'no ball', and 'L.B.W.'. Before commencing, the form of 'cricket match' to be played is agreed e.g. test cricket, limited overs cricket, etc.. An appropriate cricket scorecard is then drawn up and the teams are written in. A toss of a coin decides which team chooses to bat first. The batting side starts the game by rolling the batting die. Any runs signalled are recorded on the scorecard. When a 'owzthat' appeal is signalled, the umpire die is rolled for a decision. The batsman has a 1/3 chance of being not out, if the 'Not Out' or 'No Ball' is signalled. As in real cricket a 'No Ball' entitles the batsman to an additional strike (roll) and an extra run. A batsman is out if 'bowled', 'stumped', 'caught', or 'L.B.W.‚Äô are signalled, and the next batsman comes to the crease. Depending on the cricket format the batting side is dismissed when all the batsmen are out or and if the over limit is reached. The other side then bats in an attempt to score more runs and hence win.

The library serves as the resource library for the Winding Rivers Library System and the administrative offices for WRLS are at the public library. The library serves 50,000 people, has 245,000 volumes, and has 800,000 annual circulation transactions.http://www.librarytechnology.org/lwc-displaylibrary.pl?RC=1579 In 2005, the La Crosse Public Library won an award for its digitized history website. History After the death of former Wisconsin Governor Cadwallader C. Washburn, a large bequest was made, land was purchased, and a library was built which was opened in 1888. A children's department was opened in 1905 and in 1909 a large extension to the building was built which nearly doubled its size. After 55 years of continuous growth the library was short of space and in 1964 the Friends of the LaCrosse Public Library was formed to address the problem. By 1966 the old building had been razed and replaced by a new one which gained two architectural awards and opened in 1967. After a bequest from Susan and Elizabeth Swarthout it was possible to extend this building and provide accommodation for the La Crosse County Historical Society. The extension was opened in 1980 and in 1981 the library became a department of the city of La Crosse. the use of computers began in 1985 and in 1988 the library celebrated its centennial and the checking out of the 25 millionth book.

He held a Ph.D in Victorian literature. Born in an impoverished rural area of northern Wisconsin in 1924, his poetry career began in 1967 when his young son Richard died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis. The book commemorating this loss, Songs for a Son, was selected by poet Denise Levertov to be published by W. W. Norton in 1967, and it still remains in print. Songs for a Son began a flood of poetry. Academic beginnings After army service during World War II, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, majoring in English. He received his B.A. in 1948, his M.A. in 1949 and his doctorate in 1952. His teaching career took him to Wayne State University, Boston University, Ohio Wesleyan University, the University of Idaho, the University of California, Riverside, and then the University of California, Irvine, where he first taught in 1967. His field of study was Victorian literature. In addition to publishing articles and monographs, he edited, with Herbert Schueller, the letters of John Addington Symonds. Peters received a Fulbright Fellowship to Cambridge, England in the 1960s to work on Symonds' letters. In 1965, he published The Crowns of Apollo, a scholarly study on Algernon Charles Swinburne.Crowns of Apollo After Peters' Songs for a Son was published, he devoted more time to the writing and study of contemporary poetry. Fellow poets Charles Wright and James McMichael and novelist Oakley Hall taught poetry at UC Irvine during this time and shared directorship of the university's Master of Fine Arts program. Poet and critic Peters was a prolific poet, having published some 30 books of poems, and he was an important critic of contemporary American poetry. In his controversial books of criticism ‚Äî The Great American Poetry Bake-Off series, Peters Black and Blue Guides to Current Literary Magazines and Hunting the Snark: A Compendium of New Literary Terminology ‚Äî he assessed more than 400 contemporary poets and critics. He also wrote poetry reviews for the Los Angeles Times. His Where the Bee Sucks: Workers, Drones & Queens of Contemporary American Poetry includes 35 essays on such major figures as Robert Bly, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, John Ashbery, Diane Wakoski, Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Tess Gallagher and W. S. Merwin, as well as commentaries on the work of lesser-known poets. Billy Collins, a former student of Peters and now a poet in his own right, once described Peters' poetry: \\"[‚Ä¶] modifies poetic language and breaks new artistic ground. By combining playful rhymes with painfully serious matter, he has returned new tonal possibilities to poetry. By fully exploiting the metaphor of the body, [‚Ä¶] he has provided a fresh code for the expression of feeling ...\\" Poet and author of Iron John, Robert Bly, wrote about Peters' American Poetry Bakeoff book of criticism as \\"not maternal ... insights are set down simply, unornamented, as if intended to glance off, and yet I think they are important, and belong to the center ... He deserves numerous readers, particularly among young poets dissatisfied with the celebrities who keep writing the same poem over and over again ... [His] essay on Robert Creeley is superb; the best essay on his work I know.\\" In the fall of 2001, the 40th volume of Peters's' Familial Love and Other Misfortunes was published. Peters has served as a contributing editor for The American Book Review, Contact II and Paintbrush. =Style of poetry= His poetry covers a wide range of themes and forms, from intensely personal volumes of private celebrations and losses ‚Äî the death of a son, the break-up of a marriage, and his rural Wisconsin origins ‚Äî to excursions into the psyches of a vast gallery of historical eccentrics, numbering among them, a Bavarian king, a Hungarian countess (and mass murderer) and a British romantic painter. The root of his interest in personae poetry goes back to his studies of Victorian poet Robert Browning. He adapted both King Ludwig II of Bavaria and Elizabeth B√°thory,/the_blood_of_virgins_whitens_m_1.html Peters' Countess the Hungarian Countess, for theatrical presentation, performing them around the country. His Poems: Selected & New includes a rich sampling of work written over the past 30 years, while collecting in a single volume many of Peters' best poems. Poet Diane Wakoski best describes his poetry, \\"The fascination with the dead, with the rotting, with pigs rooting into the earth, a poem about a primal scene in a root cellar, discovering sex and the underground, taboo, death-related experience ‚Äî this is what all of Peters' poetry is about [‚Ä¶] which gives it great originality and power.\\" =Performances= His acting career developed after countless poetry readings. Peters wanted to reach a larger audience with his poetry by transforming his personae poetry into theatrical monologues replete with memorized scripts, lighting, settings and sound tracks. He performed at Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, at Carpet Company Theatre in Los Angeles, Fine Art Theatre at UCI, Provincetown's Summer Theatre, St. Matthews Church near Broadway, New York and many college campus venues. He took acting lessons from his colleague, Fine Arts Professor Robert Cohen, at University of California, Irvine. These performances are all well-documented in Peters' journals, video recordings, flyers, playbills, posters and scrapbooks, replete with reviews and photos, which are all housed and catalogued at UCSD Mandeville Special Collections Library. Memoirs Peters has written four memoirs of his days during the 1930s in the North Woods of Wisconsin. His last memoir was on the death of his third son, which took place in the 1950s. Thomas Keneally, author of Schindler's List, summarized Peters' second memoir, Nell's Story, by saying, \\"As a fascinating exercise in obscure lives retrieved, as a joint effort in painful and exultant memory, this rich memoir has the playful seriousness and inventive charm which characterizes the work of Robert Peters ...\\"\\" Awards and honors Peters has judged competitions for fellowships and prizes for small presses and for the Poetry Society of America and PEN International. He has enjoyed Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, a Fulbright Scholarship, and won the Alice Fay di Castagnola Award of the Poetry Society of America. Legacy Peters' papers from 1950‚Äì1990 are on deposit in the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas. His working library of contemporary poetry, with related papers, is now in the Rare Book Collection at Bowling Green State University. His remaining archives have been obtained by the Geisel Library Special Collections at the University of California San Diego.  Personal life  Shortly after his divorce from his wife Jean, Peters met poet Paul Trachtenberg and established a relationship lasting more than 36 years. Death He died on June 13, 2014 in Irvine CA from natural causes at the age of 89. Works =Books of poetry= *Songs for a Son, W. W.

It is a hybrid of the traditional shotgun and single back offenses. In the pistol offense, also commonly referred to as the \\"pistol formation\\", the quarterback lines up four yards behind the center, which is much closer than the seven-yard setback in a traditional shotgun formation. The running back then lines up three yards directly behind the quarterback, which is in contrast to the shotgun, where they are beside each other. It is argued that the position of the quarterback in the pistol formation strikes an advantageous compromise: the quarterback is close enough to the line of scrimmage to be able to read the defense, as with run situation sets such as the I formation, but far enough back to give him extra time and a better vision of the field for passing plays, as in the shotgun.http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/super-bowl/colin-kaepernick- and-the-pistol-a-marriage-made-in-football-heaven-1.4474186 The pistol formation is thus very versatile, particularly if the quarterback himself is a threat to run the ball, which makes it difficult for the defense to correctly anticipate the play. This flexibility is enhanced by the Read Option, where the quarterback reacts to the response of the defensive players to the snap, and makes a rapid decision whether to hand off the ball to the running back, keep it and complete a pass to a downfield receiver, or keep it and run himself. History Pistol formation used by Jerry Glanville in the 1990 season with the Atlanta Falcons against the San Francisco 49ers Michael Taylor of Mill Valley developed the Pistol formation as a complete offense (called the \\"Shotgun I\\" at that time) in 1999 while playing softball. Taylor introduced the formation to his friend, a college football coach at Division III Ohio Northern University, and during a conversation, he mentioned that his team needed to go into a new direction because his running back was quick, but his quarterback was tall and slow. Armed with this new idea of Shotgun I, Michael spent weeks developing new formations and schemes as a way of maintaining a downhill running game, while allowing his quarterback to be comfortable in the pass game. The plays worked; the backfield set was exclusively two back and included a full complement of runs to both the I back and the offset back (aligned next to the quarterback). University of Nevada head coach Chris Ault popularized the single back alignment (and renamed it the \\"Pistol\\") in 2005. While the pistol offense has been experimented with by dozens of college football teams such as LSU, Syracuse, Indiana, and Missouri, Ault's Nevada Wolf Pack is most strongly associated with the formation. Using the Pistol Offense, during the 2009 season, Nevada led the nation in rushing at 345 yards a game and were second in total offense at 506 yards. The Wolf Pack also became the first team in college football history with three 1,000-yard rushers in the same season: quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running backs Luke Lippincott and Vai Taua. Football Championship Subdivision team James Madison University used \\"The Pistol\\" to help beat #13 ranked Virginia Tech on September 11, 2010. The pistol has also made the transition to the NFL, mainly being used by the Carolina Panthers with Cam Newton and Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins, as well as the aforementioned Colin Kaepernick with the San Francisco 49ers, who in the NFL Playoffs versus the Green Bay Packers set the all-time single game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards. Along with the wildcat, the pistol has added more of a college \\"playmaker\\" aspect to the professional game. On December 5, 2010, the Pittsburgh Steelers used the Pistol offense so quarterback Ben Roethlisberger could play with a bad foot.http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/steelers/s_717926.html Advantages The pistol retains the position and advantages of a shotgun formation; allowing the quarterback to see easily over the line and make downfield reads. The running back however, is positioned further back, allowing him to time to run up and build momentum similar to a play under center. The pistol offense can effectively use draw plays, counters, and options using three-wide receiver formations or multiple tight ends combined with a fullback for pass protection. In a pistol formation, handoffs occur 2-3 yards closer to the line of scrimmage than in the shotgun. In the traditional shotgun, run plays are most effectively run to the side opposite the running back, without a cutback to the other side. In the pistol, they can be effectively executed to either side of the QB, opening up more options for the offense. This can make for a more effective running game, but may limit pass efficiency due to quicker recognition of play action by linebackers and defensive backs. This formation works well with dual threat quarterbacks who can both throw and run and is also used when quarterback's mobility has been limited by injury.

Construction began in earnest in 1868, and proceeded fitfully until 1875, when the line was finally completed and the first train made the trip. While never very busy, the line continued running until 1933, when it was abandoned. The last run took place on Saturday, April 15, 1933.

H. Roberts (1857‚Äì1933), a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which examine the validity of the Book of Mormon as a translation of an ancient American source.Paul M. Edwards, \\"Review of Studies of the Book of Mormon,\\" Christian Century 103 (August 6, 1986), 684. Studies of the Book of Mormon consists of three essays, brief correspondence related to the writing of the essays, a biographical sketch by Sterling McMurrin, and an introduction by Brigham Madsen.The manuscripts are titled \\"Book of Mormon Difficulties: A Study,\\" \\"A Book of Mormon Study,\\" and \\"A Parallel.\\" Roberts \\"served in the innermost circles of Mormonism\\" and for decades \\"used his great oratorical and writing skills, as well as his scholarly and research abilities, to defend the Book of Mormon and give it intellectual respectability.\\"Paul M. Edwards, \\"Review of Studies of the Book of Mormon, Christian Century 103 (August 6, 1986), 684. According to Brigham Young University professor Marvin S. Hill, controversy over the book \\"has focused not upon the historical issues which Roberts raised but rather on whether or not he lost his testimony of the book and the church.\\"Marvin S. Hill, \\"Review,\\" Church History 55 (December 1986), 547. Critics of Mormonism claim that Roberts lost his belief in the Book of Mormon after completing the study, even though he continued to publicly affirm the divine origin of the book. According to religion writer Richard N. Ostling, Mormon apologists were faced with one \\"of the most delicate situations\\" after publication of the book and \\"went into high gear\\" to make responses to it because \\"Roberts could not be dismissed as an outsider or an anti-Mormon.\\"Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, Mormon America: The Power and the Promise (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999), 275‚Äì76. Roberts's purpose and conclusion In the early 1920s, Roberts was asked by the First Presidency of the LDS Church to develop an apologetic to explain difficulties in the Book of Mormon, such as the lack of Hebrew or Egyptian vestiges in the languages of the Native American peoples and such historical anachronisms in the Book of Mormon as mentions of horses, oxen, wheat, and steel swords in ancient America.Ostling, 275. Roberts also compared the Book of Mormon with Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews (1823), published five years before the Book of Mormon. Smith, a Vermont clergyman, drew on, what were at the time, commonplace ideas about the relationship of the Hebrews and the American Indians. Not only did Smith's work go through many early editions, but Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith's scribe and one of the Three Witnesses to the golden plates, grew up in the Vermont town where Ethan Smith pastored the church and where Cowdery's mother and half-sisters were members. According to religion writer Richard Ostling, \\"it is probably safe to assume that Joseph Smith was familiar\\" with Ethan Smith's book. Roberts summarized his comparison of the parallels between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon as follows: Roberts was \\"torn by an internal struggle between his faith and a desire to be honest with himself.\\"Robert Lindsey, A Gathering of Saints: A True Story of Money, Murder and Deceit (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 187‚Äì88. Roberts believed that Mormonism must \\"stand or fall\\" on the truth of Joseph Smith's claim that the Book of Mormon was the history of an ancient people inscribed on golden plates and revealed to him by an angel. Yet in his studies, Roberts cited examples of what he considered discrepancies, implausibilities and contradictions in the Book of Mormon. According to Marvin S. Hill, Roberts \\"maintained that the Book of Mormon's claims that the Indians were derived solely from three migrations of Hebrews to the new world over a span of three thousand years was entirely untenable.\\" And Roberts concluded that the \\"evidence I sorrowfully submit\\" pointed to Joseph Smith as the Book of Mormon's creator. Although Roberts's manuscripts were intended for perusal by the general authorities of the LDS Church, the authorities proved uninterested in examining them. Roberts wrote in a letter to Elizabeth Skolfield (14 March 1932): \\"I am forwarding you with this mail an introductory chapter to a work of mine which is in typewritten form under the title 'Book of Mormon Study.' It makes 435 pages of typewritten matter. It is from research work I did before going to take charge of the Eastern States Mission [in May 1922]. I had written it for presentation to the Twelve and the Presidency, not for publication, but I suspended the submission of it until I returned home, but I have not yet succeeded in making the presentation of it, although a letter of submission was made previous to leaving the E. S. M. [in 1927]. I have made one feeble effort to get it before them since returning home, but they are not in a studious mood.\\" Roberts argued that his study was \\"of very great importance since it represents what may be used by some opponent in criticism of the Book of Mormon.\\" He also warned that the problems described would haunt the church \\"both now and also in the future\\" and, unless answered, they would undermine \\"the faith of the Youth of the Church.\\" Overview Roberts gave three conditions that would suggest that one book had been derived from another: that the derivative book had appeared after its model, that the author of the derivative book had access to the model, and that the derivative work be similar to the model. Roberts concluded that View of the Hebrews had been published first, that the possibility that Joseph Smith had access to it was \\"a very close certainty,\\" and that there were many similarities between the works. Smith himself indicated that he was aware of the book, having mentioned Ethan Smith and cited passages from View of the Hebrews in an article published in the Times and Seasons 3:15 (1 June 1842): 813‚Äì15. The bulk of Roberts's manuscript considers the similarities between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon. =Origin of New World peoples= Roberts states that both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon claim that the Hebrews \\"occupied the whole extent of the American continents\\" and that this idea was \\"very generally obtained throughout New England.\\". Modern Mormon apologists argue a limited geography theory of the Book of Mormon civilizations, which Roberts himself did not believe \\"the Book of Mormon would admit our assuming.\\": \\"[C]ould the people of Mulek and of Lehi ... part of the time numbering and occupying the land at least from Yucatan to Cumorah ... live and move and have their being in the land of America and not come in contact with other races and tribes of men, if such existed in the New World within Book of Mormon times? To make this seem possible the area occupied by the Nephites and Lamanites would have to be extremely limited, much more limited, I fear, than the Book of Mormon would admit our assuming.\\" =Migration= Both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon refer to a migration of peoples to America. Roberts notes several parallels between the migration of the Jaredites and that of the Ten Lost Tribes in the Jewish apocalypse 2 Esdras (as interpreted by Ethan Smith). Both journeys are \\"religiously motivated, both groups enter valleys at the commencement of their journeys, both apparently travel north between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, both cross water barriers, both trips take years, and both groups travel to uninhabited lands.\\"Dan Vogel, Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2004), 344; =Destruction of Jerusalem= Roberts notes that the entire first chapter of View of the Hebrews describes the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. He compares this chapter to the first chapters of the Book of Mormon, in which Lehi prophesies of the destruction of Jerusalem prior to his departure circa 600 B.C. Mormon apologists argue that View of the Hebrews does not refer to the earlier destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians circa 586 B.C. =Lost books= In View of the Hebrews, \\"an old Indian\\" said that his ancestors \\"had a book which they had for a long time preserved,\\" but that \\"having lost the knowledge of reading it ‚Ä¶ they buried it with an Indian chief.\\" View of the Hebrews mentions a Jewish phylactery dug from the ground which \\"contained four folded leaves\\" of \\"dark yellow\\" parchment. Roberts compares this story with Joseph Smith's retrieval of the golden plates in a New York hillock, and adds the question, \\"Could all this have supplied structural work for the Book of Mormon?\\" =Breastplate and the Urim and Thummin= View of the Hebrews describes a breastplate \\"in resemblance of the Urim and Thummin\\" made of a white conch shell with two holes to which are fastened white buckhorn buttons \\"as if in imitation of the precious stones of the Urim.\\" Roberts compares this to the Urim and Thummim which Joseph Smith said that he was given for the purpose of translating the golden plates. =\\"Egyptian\\" hieroglyphics= View of the Hebrews describes hieroglyphic paintings found in the American southwest. Roberts wrote, \\"Was this sufficient to suggest the strange manner of writing the Book of Mormon ‚Ä¶ in an altered Egyptian?\\" (Joseph Smith said that the golden plates were written in \\"reformed Egyptian\\".) =Barbarous versus civilized New World people= View of the Hebrews argues that the Hebrews who arrived on the American continents divided into two classes, that \\"most of them fell into a wandering idle hunting life\\" but that \\"more sensible parts of this people associated together to improve their knowledge of the arts.\\" The more civilized portion of this society separated from the more primitive group, who \\"lost the knowledge of their having descended from the same family.\\" As a result of \\"tremendous wars,\\" the civilized group \\"became extinct.\\" In the Book of Mormon, the Nephites and Lamanites also split into two groups and have frequent wars, which ultimately result in the extinction of the more civilized Nephites.. =Government= In both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon, part of the ancient inhabitants of America changed from monarchical governments to republican governments, and the civil and ecclesiastical power was united in the same person.. =Prophecy about the scattering and gathering of Israel= Roberts notes that in both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon there are extensive quotations from the Book of Isaiah regarding the scattering and future gathering of Israel. Roberts asks, \\"Did the Author of the Book of Mormon follow too closely the course of Ethan Smith in this use of Isaiah would be a legitimate query.\\" Mormon apologists reply that View of the Hebrews includes many other scriptural prophecies about the restoration of Israel, whereas the Book of Mormon quotes only from Isaiah chapter 11. View of the Hebrews includes quotations from Deuteronomy 30; Isaiah 11, 18, 60, 65; Jeremiah 16, 23, 30‚Äì31, 35‚Äì37; Zephaniah 3; Amos 9; Hosea and Joel. =White god in the New World= Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the Codex Magliabechiano. View of the Hebrews discusses legends of what he called the \\"bearded white god\\" Quetzalcoatl and proposes that this \\"lawgiver\\" or \\"Mexican messiah\\" might have been Moses.: \\"Who could this be but Moses, the ancient legislator in Israel?\\" Ethan Smith also suggests that this belief held by the people of Mexico at the time of Montezuma allowed the Spanish to easily conquer the country because \\"the Mexicans mistook the white bearded invaders from the east for the descendants of their long cherished culture-hero Quetzalcoatl.\\" Roberts asks rhetorically if \\"this character spoken of in the View of the Hebrews\\" furnished the suggestion of Jesus Christ in the New World in the Book of Mormon. Controversy about Roberts's parallels Some Mormon apologists have argued that Roberts's parallels are unimportant both because many of them have been answered by Mormon apologists in the intervening years and because there are also many \\"unparallels\\" between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon.Walsh-Lindsay response Critics reply that Joseph Smith was not obligated to use everything he found in the View of the Hebrews, that he might well have taken major ideas and discarded others according to his fancy, and that furthermore, the conceptual differences are minor and the similarities major.David Persuitt, Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1985), 111‚Äì12. Controversy about Roberts's ultimate beliefs Non-Mormons have argued that Roberts's belief in the Book of Mormon may have been shaken by his research. For instance, a reviewer of the book for The Christian Century wrote that not only did Roberts \\"have serious doubts\\" about the Book of Mormon, but that his investigations raised \\"questions about his own beliefs.\\"Paul M. Edwards, \\"Review of Studies of the Book of Mormon, Christian Century 103 (August 6, 1986), 684. See also James R. Spencer, \\"The Disappointment of B. H. Roberts: Five Questions That Forced a Mormon General Authority to Abandon the Book of Mormon,\\" (1991) A Mormon General Authority's Doubts About the Authenticity of the Book of Mormon Mormons in Transition, sponsored by the Institute for Religious Research. Mormon apologists have replied that Roberts must have been playing devil's advocate, because he continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon until his death. Marvin S. Hill has argued, however, \\"this contention seems strained considering his pleadings at the end of each section that church leaders must offer inspired help.\\"Marvin S. Hill, \\"Review,\\" Church History 55 (December 1986), 548. Mormon apologists have also argued that Sterling McMurrin and Brigham D. Madsen, who edited the volume, \\"misrepresented Roberts's final views about the historicity of Mormon scriptures.\\"Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, Mormon America: The Power and the Promise (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999), 276. Mormon apologists often refer to a letter that Roberts wrote‚Äîbut never sent‚Äîto the general authorities: \\"In writing out this my report to you of those studies, I have written it from the viewpoint of an open mind, investigating the facts of the Book of Mormon origin and authorship. Let me say once and for all, so as to avoid what might otherwise call for repeated explanation, that what is herein set forth does not represent any conclusions of mine. The report herewith submitted is what it purports to be, namely a 'study of Book of Mormon origins,' for the information of those who ought to know everything about it pro et con, as well as that which has been produced against it. I do not say my conclusions for they are undrawn. It may be of great importance since it represents what may be used by some opponent in criticism of the Book of Mormon. I am taking the position that our faith is not only unshaken but unshakable in the Book of Mormon, and therefore we can look without fear upon all that can be said against it.\\"  Controversy within the LDS Church after the 1985 publication  The publication of Roberts's study \\"caused much protest in some circles in Utah.\\"Marvin S. Hill, \\"Review,\\" Church History 55 (December 1986), 547. Sterling McMurrin, a University of Utah philosophy professor, even \\"charged that there was an unsuccessful effort to have the University of Illinois suppress publication of the study.\\"Ostling, 276. According to writer Robert Lindsay, \\"Church leaders struggled to hold back the tide of research and regain control over the past.\\" In 1996, many years after Roberts's study had been available through Jerald and Sandra Tanner, prominent critics of the church, and more than a decade after the University of Illinois had published Roberts's Study, BYU republished View of the Hebrews.Richard N.

The vigil is celebrated on the eves of Sundays and of major liturgical feasts. The vigil has been set to music most famously by Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose setting of selections from the service is one of his most admired works. Tchaikovsky's setting of the all-night vigil, along with his Divine Liturgy and his collection of nine sacred songs were of seminal importance in the later interest in Orthodox music in general, and settings of the all-night vigil in particular. Other musical settings include those by Chesnokov, Grechaninov, Ippolitov-Ivanov, Alexander Kastalsky, Hilarion Alfeyev, Clive Strutt and Einojuhani Rautavaara. It is most often celebrated using a variety of traditional or simplified chant melodies based on the Octoechos or other sources. Order When celebrated at the All-night vigil, the orders of Great Vespers and Matins vary somewhat from when they are celebrated by themselves. In parish usage, many portions of the service such as the readings from the Synaxarion during the Canon at Matins are abbreviated or omitted, and it therefore takes approximately two or two and a half hours to perform. The Psalms cited below are numbered according to the Septuagint, which differs from that found in the Masoretic. =Great Vespers= * Great Censing of the entire church, done in silence * Opening exclamation by the priest: \\"Glory to the holy, consubstantial, life-creating, and undivided Trinity, always, now and ever, and unto ages of ages\\" * \\"Come let us worship God our king\\" * \\"Psalm of creation\\", Psalm 103, sung (in modern practise only selected verses) * Great Litany * First Kathisma (entirely on Sundays) or the 1st stasis on weekdays * Little Litany * \\"Lord I have cried\\" (psalms 140,141,129, 116), with appointed stichera, ending with the Dogmatic Theotokion, a hymn addressed to the Theotokos * Entrance *Phos Hilaron (\\"O gladsome light\\") * Prokeimenon for the day * Old Testament readings (if appointed) * Augmented Litany * The prayer, \\"Vouchsafe, O Lord\\" * Litany of Askings * Litia (on Sundays and certain feastdays) * Aposticha * Nunc dimittis (\\"Now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace\\") and Trisagion prayers * Apolytikion‚Äîon Sundays: \\"Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos...\\"; otherwise, the one appointed for the feast * Artoklasia, if there was a Litia * \\"Blessed be the name of the Lord\\", Psalm 33 (first ten verses), and a blessing =Matins= * \\"Glory to God in the highest\\", \\"O Lord, open Thou my lips\\" * Six Psalms (Psalms 3, 37, 61, 87, 102, and 142) * Great Litany * \\"God is the Lord\\", with verses from Psalm 117 * Apolytikion‚Äîon Sundays: from the Octoechos; otherwise, for the feast‚Äîand its appropriate Theotokion * Kathisma * Little Litany * Sessional hymns * Kathisma * Little Litany * Sessional hymns * 17th Kathisma (Psalm 118) or Polyeleon (Psalms 134 and 135) as appointed for the season * Megalynarion (feast days) * Resurrectional Troparia, \\"The Angelic Council...\\" (Sundays only) * Little Litany * Anabathmoi * Hypakoe * Matins Prokeimenon * Matins Gospel * \\"Having beheld the Resurrection of Christ\\" (on Sundays), or the appointed stichera (on feast days) *Psalm 50 (\\"Have mercy on me, O God\\", Miserere) * Prayer, \\"O God save thy people and bless thine inheritance...\\" * Canon.

In 2019, Benjamin Walker portrayed Erik Gelden in the third season of the Netflix TV series Jessica Jones set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Mind-Wave first appeared in Daredevil #133 (May 1976), and was created by Marv Wolfman, Bob Brown and Jim Mooney. The character subsequently appears in Captain America #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld. Fictional character biography =Erik Gelden= Mind-Wave was a megalomaniac criminal possessing mental abilities heightened by his own inventions. He robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by Daredevil and Uri Geller. At the time he utilized his 'think tank', capable of firing various weapons.Daredevil #133. Marvel Comics (New York). Mind-Wave's mental abilities failed to warn him about the Scourge of the Underworld, who killed him in the \\"Bar With No Name\\" massacre. Mind-Wave was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.Punisher Vol. 7 #5 Mirage disguises himself, Mind-Wave, and some of the other criminals as a team of Avengers trying to kill the Punisher. After the Punisher uncovers the ruse, he captures Mirage, kills Mind-Wave with a grenade, and leaves him with a grenade as a booby trap for the other criminals to find.Punisher Vol. 7 #8 =Mindwave= A new Mind-Wave appears as a Superhuman Registration Act violator. He amuses the officers of a Las Vegas, Nevada police precinct by claiming he was there to officially protest the Registration Act, and clarifying that his codename was different from the man who was called \\"Mind Hyphen Wave.\\" He then used his telekinetic powers to destroy the station and kill the police officers present before calmly surrendering to the Thunderbolts.Thunderbolts #116. Marvel Comics (New York). Mindwave is escorted to a cell in Thunderbolts Mountain. When left alone, he begins a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, Bluestreak, and Mirage, during which he suggests that it would be fun to interfere with the surgery scheduled to be performed on Bullseye.Thunderbolts #117. Marvel Comics (New York). However, Bullseye recovers from his surgery while Mindwave's attention is focused on the other Thunderbolts, and kills Mindwave and his allies in their cells using thrown scalpels.Thunderbolts #121. Marvel Comics (New York). Powers and abilities The first Mind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers particularly ESP, with which he could blindside a non-telepathic opponent at will. His helmet also enabled him to communicate mentally with others wearing similar helmets, with his \\"Think Tank\\" or with other ESPers. Mind-Wave's \\"Think Tank\\" was a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers which he used to rob banks. It had heat-ray cannons. He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray. The second Mind-Wave was primarily a very powerful telekinetic, with the ability to destroy structures and halt and redirect hails of bullets in mid-flight. He also had some measure of telepathic ability, which he used to converse with his fellow prisoners and combine his power with theirs, in an attempt to destroy Thunderbolts by driving them insane. He wore a costume composed of dark body armor and a helmet resembling a gas mask. In other media A reimagined version of Erik Gelden appears in the third season of the Netflix TV series Jessica Jones, portrayed by Benjamin Walker. This version is an ally and love interest for Jessica Jones, whose powers have gone from traditional telepathy to empathic powers that can detect evil, though he cannot specifically identify the crime. He also has a sister named Brianna \\"Berry\\" Gelden (portrayed by Jamie Neumann) who works as a prostitute. Gelden uses his abilities to blackmail people who have secretly performed criminal acts. He blackmails Gregory Salinger who responded by hunting Gelden to kill him, but accidentally stabs Jessica. This act has Jessica force Gelden to reveal his abilities and the fact that he has been collecting money to pay off gangsters. Gelden has Jessica and her allies protect Brianna after Salinger threatens her, but Salinger ends up catching Gelden. Being in close proximity to Salinger causes Gelden to bleed profusely from his face. He is eventually rescued by Jessica and Trish Walker. Trish however, begins using Gelden to look for criminals to intimidate. She begins killing them which relieves Gelden's headaches, but soon he begins having headaches around Trish. He tells Jones to stop Trish. Afterwards, Jones tells him that she does not trust him and he leaves. Gelden is last seen at a bar being approached by Detective Eddy Costa about using his abilities to help the police.

It was released on 27 July 1979. The single and its B-side, \\"Victims of the Riddle (Vivisection)\\" were featured on the LP version of Sheep Farming In Barnet, which was itself an extended reissue of the band's next single. They also featured on the 2005 compilation album The Safari Singles Collection Part 1: 1979-1981.  History  \\"Victims of the Riddle\\" was considered by some as being a very brave single choice, especially as a debut. \\"'Victims Of The Riddle' was mainly my choice because I wanted to be as weird and far away from the mainstream as possible. In fact, being weird was my priority. If I was to go back in time I'd have made the first single 'Neon Womb'\\", Toyah remarked in 2011. There was, apparently, some friction within the band as to the authorship. In 1980, speaking to ZigZag fanzine, Toyah said: In 2011, speaking of the old songs she cherry-picked for her 30th Anniversary concert tour, Toyah commented: = Controversy = The single courted controversy due to its intentionally disturbing front cover image ‚Äî a photograph of one of the mummies of Guanajuato in Mexico (from a book by Ray Bradbury entitled The Mummies of Guanajuato), holding a note which asked \\"Is there a heaven? Is there a hell? Do both exist? Who can tell?\\". This was drawn over the original inscription, which bore the name of the actual mummy ‚Äî Magdalena Aguilar, and her date of burial which was 8 September 1897. Her mummified body was exhumed on 27 December 1909.  Critical reception  In April 1979 New Musical Express wrote: \\"Toyah's backdrop is a quirky maze of fixing electronic and electric sounds, an intelligent sub-disco underlay. Toyah herself screeches and howls and makes the simple art of reviewing something of an endurance test. Angry and powerful, that's what it is, riotously and genuinely performed. But painful and disappointing too, after all the pre-release build up... 'Is there a heaven?/Is there a hell?/Do both exist?/Who can tell?' runs the deep intellect on the sleeve front.

It deals with a boy, Charlie, becoming possessed by a demon that manifests itself in the form of a black tattoo on his body. The audiobook, read by John Lee, won a Publishers Weekly \\"Listen Up\\" Award in 2006 and was picked by YALSA as one of their \\"Selected Audiobooks for Young Adults\\" in 2008.  Plot summary  The story begins with Charlie, whose parents are recently divorced, meeting his father in a restaurant with his best friend Jack Farrell. They leave the restaurant, however, soon after entering. Soon afterward, Charlie is unknowingly possessed by a demon known as the Scourge. He also joins the society known as The Brotherhood Of Sleep, who imprisoned the Scourge in the roots of a tree until one of their own released him. With Charlie's help, the Scourge manages to first kill all the members of the Brotherhood, save for the girl Esme, who has trained all her life to kill the demon. Soon after the death of their members, a possessed Charlie gets into a gateway to Hell, which is essentially a Roman Empire of sorts composed of demonesque species and even gladiator pits. Soon after reaching Hell, The Scourge's true goal is revealed: He wishes to awaken \\"the dragon\\" who created the universe, and upon awakening he will destroy it again. Suddenly, it is up to Jack, Esme, and a team of soldiers to stop Charlie and the Scourge from destroying the universe.  Characters  * Jack Farrell Jack is the main protagonist. He is killed in Hell but reincarnated by God who makes \\"some changes\\" though it is not revealed what they really are. It is mentioned that Jack is \\"part Demon\\" by his Chinj. Chinjs are small bat like creatures who bond with one specific person (usually a demon) and work as a sort of companion and minor servant. One of a Chinj's powers is that it can regulate Jack's digestive system and transfer needed nutrients to his body * Charlie Farnsworth Charlie is the boy possessed by the Scourge. He nearly ends the Universe, but is stopped by Jack and Esme. Initially, the discovery of his demonic powers gives him a sense of strength and invulnerability, as being able to fly, use magic and manipulate others increases his headstrong nature. Soon, the power corrupts his mind, allowing the Scourge to burrow into his darkened soul, controlling him entirely and making him attack his companions. After being transported to hell, the Scourge convinces him that his tattered family and ruined life is not worth keeping and asks him to help him overthrow the emperor of hell instead. However, Charlie believes that he is a counterpart to the Scourge, although he is in fact a simple pawn, a puppet. * Esme Leverton Esme is the daughter of Felix who when Esme was conceived was possessed by The Scourge, though this is not originally known. Esme thought her father was Raymond, but on the night she was conceived Felix had magically transformed to look like Raymond in order to get one night of happiness with Esme's mother. She trained her entire life to fight the Scourge, and is extraordinarily talented in the martial arts, flying, and art. *Raymond Raymond is a large burly man with a long black beard. Initially, he strikes a resemblance to the character Rubeus Hagrid from the Harry Potter book series. He is a master of martial arts and is also highly trained sword craftsman. He is Esme's father, training her and teaching her the arts of battling demons, however, as he sees his once peaceful daughter become a toned fighting machine, he regrets having started. His method of sword crafting involves creating a blade, then breaking it into shards of metal which he then feeds to several tamed pigeons, mixed with their birdseed. He then collects their excrements, which still have the shards inside them, and melts the pieces down again and feeds them once again to the pigeons. each time the pieces are digested, they are hardened and worn down, becoming more powerful each time. after having collected the shards several times, he finally forges them back into a blade, which has been made close to invincible by the digesting process: this method has aptly named the blade the Pigeon Sword. *The Scourge The Scourge is the primary antagonist of the story. An immensely powerful demon created by the Dragon, the Scourge is imprisoned on Earth to stop it from fulfilling its nefarious plan. A vicious, dedicated fanatic, the Scourge plans to wake the Dragon and bring the universe to an end, creating what the Scourge believes to be a \\"pure, silent Void\\". The Scourge possesses incredible powers, including (but in no way limited to) telekinesis, mind control, astral projection, flying, super speed, incredible skill in the martial arts, etc. However, the Scourge has one weakness: it needs a host to survive. Although it doesn't necessarily have to stay with the possesses person at all times, it must possess somebody or it will wither and die. The plotline of the novel is motivated by the Scourge's possession of Charlie. The Scourge appears as an intricate web of black tattoos on its host's body, but when in its separated physical form, it appears as a featureless humanoid composed of an inky black liquid. *The Sons of the Scorpion Flail They are a team of approximately thirty individuals of several walks of life. They were assembled by the enigmatic *Number One* and have dedicated their lives to battling the forces of Hell. They are akin to a more equipped version of the Brotherhood of Sleep, armed with powerful firearms and advanced technology. They are led by an inept, cowardly soldier known as second-in-command Number Two, who will only take orders from Number One, whom he has never actually met. He dislikes his counterpart, the French gentleman Number Three, who disagrees on his methods of violence and harsh actions.

WSVA is owned and operated by Saga Communications, through licensee Tidewater Communications, LLC. History WSVA went on the air on June 9, 1935 with 500 watts of power. It was the first radio station to broadcast in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Although it appears that the call letters stand for Shenandoah VAlley, they actually stand for We Serve Virginia Agriculture.\\" The station was affiliated with NBC, and offered news, agricultural programs, music and other items of local interest. Bluegrass singer Mac Wiseman worked at the station as a news reader and disc jockey in the 1940s. WSVA was originally owned by Frederick L. Allman. In 1946, it produced the Valley's first FM station, WSVA-FM (now WQPO), and in 1953 it added a television station, WSVA-TV (now WHSV-TV). Allman sold his stations to a partnership of Transcontinent Television and former NBC executive Hamilton Shea in 1956, earning a significant return on his investment of 21 years earlier. In 1959, the Washington Evening Star, owner of WMAL AM-FM-TV in Washington, D.C., bought Transcontinent's share of the stations, as well as 1% of Shea's stake. Michigan businessman James Gilmore bought the WSVA stations in 1965. Gilmore sold off channel 3 in 1976, but held onto the radio stations until 1987, when he sold them to local businessman John David VerStandig. Over the years, VerStandig added WTGD-FM, WJDV-FM, and WHBG-AM to his portfolio. In 2009 the station moved into a new building located on the same property to the old one on Heritage Center Way. On January 1, 2015, WSVA began simulcasting its programming on FM translator W221CF, broadcasting at 92.1 FM. It exists to fill in the gaps in WSVA's nighttime coverage. The AM signal must power down to 1,000 watts at night to protect the directional nighttime signal of WGR in Buffalo, New York and other regional stations. The sale of Verstandig Broadcasting of Harrisonburg to Saga Communications was closed on July 31, 2015, at a purchase price of $9.64 million. Programming The WSVA morning show, known as \\"Early Mornings\\" airs from 5:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and features hosts Frank Wilt and Jim Britt along with news reported by Karl Magenhofer. Mike Schikman hosts afternoon drive time; a noon news hour is also locally originated. The station's syndicated programming is a hodgepodge of programs from various networks including The Dave Ramsey Show, shows from Westwood One (The Mark Levin Show, The John Batchelor Show and Red Eye Radio) and the Salem Radio Network (Hugh Hewitt and, on weekends, Sebastian Gorka). Weekend talk programming consists of numerous lifestyle programs (such as The Kim Komando Show, Clark Howard, Music and the Spoken Word and The Lars Larson Show). WSVA broadcast local sports programs including high school football, basketball and baseball along with James Madison University football and basketball broadcast.

The parish is sometimes referred to as two parts ‚Äì Great Singleton is the larger part containing the village, and Little Singleton is a small area north of the village bordering the River Wyre. History At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the area around Singleton was inhabited by a Celtic tribe called the Setantii. The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Singletun. Singleton railway station once served the village as part of the Preston and Wyre Joint Railway. The station was situated west of the village, on the road to Blackpool. Singleton Hall is a Gothic mansion on Lodge Lane, built in 1873 for Thomas Horrocks Miller, son of a prominent Preston industrialist. The Hall was later used by Lancashire County Council as a special school and is now converted into private residences. The grounds are open to the public and maintained by the Richard Dumbreck Singleton Trust, endowed by Richard Dumbreck, a great-nephew of Thomas Horrocks Miller. The Miller family also commissioned Singleton's parish church, St Anne's, designed by Lancaster architect Edward Graham Paley and completed in 1861. It has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage. Fracking In 2011, drilling equipment was installed at Grange Hill, east of the village, to test for shale gas in the Bowland Shale Formation around 3 km below the surface. In 2013 Cuadrilla and Centrica made plans for hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, at the site.

Overview Each book contains fifteen mysteries, set up in a similar fashion to the 1990s book series, but meant for a more mature audience. However, the Clue Mysteries have some comic absurdity like the 1990s series. The characters take on names similar to the North American version but more often than not have backstories nearer to the European.

For one reason or another, Hugh had put Boddy, Peacock, Scarlet, Mustard, Green and Plum on a generous monthly allowance for years. (The poor maid, it seems, never saw a penny; she lives at the mansion in exchange for cooking and cleaning.) While Boddy spent his allowance wisely, investing and being select with his purchases, the others had all been taking greedy advantages while Hugh was alive, cheating him out of more money over the years and blowing their allowances on frivolity. Boddy, upon claiming Hugh's fortune, stands to end that immediately, with plans to cut them all off once the inheritance is official. With that, all the guests have a motive. Characters * Mr. John Boddy: The heir to the mansion. An archaeological hobbyist. He recently discovered a steady \\"trickle\\" of allowances from his uncle's estate to the colourful characters, and plans to put an end to it all. * Mrs. Blanche White: His faithful maid and terrible cook who has little to show for her years of dedicated service. She lives at the mansion in exchange for her services. * Mrs. Patricia Peacock: The thrice widowed mother of Miss Scarlet; who is running out of her most recently deceased husband's money faster than she can handle. Her three husbands - James Scarlet, Ernest Zaffer and Sir Matthew Peacock, all seem to have died of mysterious, yet similar circumstances. * Miss Josephine Scarlet: The seductive and attractive daughter of Mrs Peacock; their relationship is angry and bitter. An aspiring (yet woefully untalented) actress with a fondness for rich, yet older widowers. * Colonel Michael Mustard: A 'gallant' war hero whose medals are a matter of question. Impoverished and hounded by tax collectors and creditors, he needs money, and fast. * Mr. John Green (AKA Reverend Green): A man of god, despite not finishing seminary. Suspected to be involved in fraud, theft and money laundering. * Professor Peter Plum: A brilliant mind, now dimming.

He is best known for leading an attack against Spanish Florida in 1568, in response to the destruction of the French Fort Caroline. He was a captain in King Charles IX's army. Youth De Gourgue's early life is not well known. He came from the old and powerful family of Gourgue, one of the most important families of the French city of Bordeaux. He served in the Italian wars under Mar√©chal de Strozzi, was captured by Spaniards in 1557, and then by the Turks, and served several years in the galleys. After his return to France, he made a voyage to Brazil and the West Indies, and then entered the service of Duke de Guise, and was employed against the Huguenots.Appletons' Situation in the colonies View of Fort Caroline Philip II of Spain was a Roman Catholic king who hated Protestants, including the French Huguenots, and considered them heretics. He ordered his troops to kill any they found in the colonies. Therefore, in 1565, troops under Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s notoriously massacred hundreds of Frenchmen around Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. After capturing the fort and slaying nearly all his prisoners, Men√©ndez hung their bodies on trees, with the inscription, \\"Not as Frenchmen but as Lutherans.\\"Hannay The massacre aroused indignation in France among Protestants and Catholics alike. The French king sent complaints to the Spanish court, but Men√©ndez and his associates, instead of being punished for the deed, received rewards and honors. Revenge Floride fran√ßaise (\\"French Florida\\"), by Pierre du Val, 17th century. Embittered by the cruelty and indignity that he had suffered from the Spaniards, de Gourgue determined to avenge the murder of his Protestant compatriots, though he was himself a Catholic. He sold everything he had and borrowed money from his brother Antoine to recruit a crew and charter three ships. He sailed to Cuba with two hundred men, never telling them the goal of their trip. Once in Cuba he made his intentions clear, and his crew approved his choice of revenge. Gourgue then moved to attack Spanish- held Fort Caroline, which they had renamed as Fort San Mateo, enlisting the aid of Fort Caroline's old allies, the Saturiwa and Tacatacuru clans of the Timucua Indians. The fort soon surrendered to de Gourgue's forces. The French and Indians killed the Spanish prisoners in retribution for Fort Caroline and other massacres of Protestants.Morison, p. 470 They hanged the prisoners with the inscription, \\"Not as Spaniards but as murderers.\\"Hannay Later life De Gourgue returned to the port of La Rochelle on 6 June 1568. He was received cordially by Monluc, governor of Bordeaux, but coldly by the court, which feared a rupture with Spain. For several years he lived in obscurity, almost in misery, at Rouen with the president of Marigny, until restored to the king's favor in 1572. He was given command of a vessel, and participated in the Siege of La Rochelle, commanding the largest vessel of the squadron. In 1592 Don Antonio de Crato appointed him commander of the fleet for a campaign for the crown of Portugal against Philip II. While on the journey, de Gourgue died.

WIC enables application developers to perform image processing operations on any image format through a single set of common APIs, without requiring prior knowledge of specific image formats.  Features  Windows Imaging Component provides an extensible architecture for image codecs, pixel formats, and metadata, with automatic run-time discovery of new formats. It supports reading and writing of arbitrary metadata in image files, with the ability to preserve unrecognized metadata during editing.

History Semana was founded in 1946 by Alberto Lleras Camargo (who would become president of Colombia in 1958) and that folded in 1961. It was relaunched by journalist Felipe L√≥pez Caballero in 1983.  Development  :es:Felipe L√≥pez Caballero , the person who restarted the magazine, took two earlier Colombian magazines as models. One was Camargo's Semana; the other was :es:Alternativa, a left-wing weekly published by Enrique Santos and Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. The foreign magazines that he strove to imitate were Time and Newsweek. Recalling the prestige that had been enjoyed by Lleras's magazine, L√≥pez asked for, and was given, permission to use the same name. The first issue came out on 12 May 12 1982. Its cover story was about terrorism. Some of Semanas most important reporting has been about Pablo Escobar, the drug trafficking kingpin. In the 1980s, L√≥pez was one of the two \\"big whistleblowers and critics\\" of drug trafficking. Since then, however, the magazine has become less exclusively political. =Proceso 8000= Semanas coverage of Proceso 8000, the unofficial name of the legal investigation of accusations that Ernesto Samper's 1994 presidential campaign was partially funded with drug money, was the high point of the magazine's influence. Yet while the magazine covered Samper's activities with brutal honesty, L√≥pez never fell out personally with Samper. Once he invited Samper and radio journalist Julio S√°nchez Cristo, a fierce Samper critic, to lunch in hopes of making peace between them. Samper told L√≥pez \\"you have been very harsh [duro],\\" and Sanchez injected that L√≥pez had been harsh out of conviction, while he (Sanchez) had done it for money. Recent years In recent years, Semana has been critical of the administration of √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez and has also taken on Colombian guerrilla and paramilitary groups. In May 2009, Semana opposed a possible second re-election of Uribe, arguing that \\"a third term ... would have serious institutional repercussions\\" and that keeping Uribe in power would only aggravate the \\"erosion of separation of powers that has taken place during these seven years.\\" While acknowledging that \\"the popularity of the President ... is undeniable and probably deserved,\\" Semana concluded that a third term for Uribe would, on the whole, be inadvisable. On the occasion of its 30th anniversary in 2012, Semana was described as \\"one of the major and largest publications in the Americas\\" by Finanzas.com, which observed that its history had been \\"tied up with the most important events in Colombia\\" and that it had \\"recorded our country's most significant successes.\\" Although there had been great changes in Colombia, the magazine's principles had \\"not changed in these thirty years.\\" =Attempt on Calderon= In May 2013, Ricardo Calderon, the prize-winning investigative editor of Semana, was surprised by gunmen, who men shot \\"five bullets into his car \\", but he escaped without injury. The Associated Press noted that at the time of the murder attempt Calderon had been working on an investigative series about \\"the scandalously luxurious life of military officers jailed for crimes including murder and crimes against humanity at Tolemaida army base.\\" Although a great many local journalists in Colombia have been murdered over the last few decades, this was, according to the Associated Press, \\"the first attempt on the life of a Semana journalist in the magazine's 30 years and it sent shock waves through the news media and human rights communities because of Calderon's stature.\\" On 10 09 2020 Revista Semana withdrew the posibility of writing opinions at the end of each articles, canceling the possibility of feedback on them. Honors and awards Semana won the Premio Rey de Espana two years in a row, in 2007 and 2008. The 2007 award acknowledged the magazine's 25 years of investigative journalism. In 2008, the magazine won the award for a series of articles that uncovered the strong ties between political leaders and illegal right-wing paramilitary groups.

Like all attack transports, the purpose of the Gilliams was to transport troops and their equipment to foreign shores in order to execute amphibious invasions using an array of smaller amphibious assault boats carried by the attack transport itself. Like all the attack transports, the Gilliam-class was heavily armed with antiaircraft weaponry to protect itself and its cargo of troops from air attack in the battle zone. History The Gilliam-class utilized the Maritime Commission (MARCOM)'s Type S4-SE2-BD1 hull. All 32 vessels of the class were built under MARCOM contracts by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Wilmington, California.shipbuildinghistory.com S type ships The first of the ships, , rolled off the Wilmington ways on 28 March 1944 and was commissioned on 1 August 1944. The rest rapidly followed, a new Gilliam-class vessel rolling of the shipways at an average of roughly one per week until April 1945. The Gilliams, with less than half the displacement, were significantly inferior in both troop and cargo carrying capacity to the previous class of attack transport, the s, and also slightly slower. It is not clear therefore why they were produced but probably it was simply because attack transports were at this time a much-needed type and the Navy chose to utilize any available shipbuilding capacity to acquire them. The other Type S4 attack cargo ships were the and es, both S4-SE2-BE1. The was built on the Victory ship hull. =World War II service= As they arrived relatively late in the war, Gilliam-class ships did not get much chance to see combat. Some of the earlier vessels saw action at either the Battle of Luzon or the Battle of Iwo Jima and later at the Invasion of Okinawa, while later vessels saw combat either at Okinawa alone or not at all. Regardless, all of them spent a considerable part of their time on troop transport, cargo and other support missions. =Postwar missions= In the immediate postwar period, the Gilliams, like most other classes of attack transport, were initially utilized to transport US troops for occupation duties - in Japan, China, Korea and other Far Eastern locations formerly occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army - and later as participants in Operation Magic Carpet, the giant sealift organized to bring hundreds of thousands of demobilizing soldiers back to the United States. =Operation Crossroads= A gaggle of Gilliam-class vessels at Pearl Harbor, awaiting disposal in Operation Crossroads - from front to rear, Crittenden (APA-77), Catron (APA-71), Bracken (APA-64), Burleson (APA-67), Gilliam (APA-57), Fallon (APA-81), one unidentified ship, and Fillmore (APA-83) At the end of the war, the US Navy found itself with far more ships than it required in peacetime. Some of these ships were dispensed with in Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1946. These tests were designed to assess the effects of nuclear detonations on shipping. For the purpose, the Navy collected somewhere between 70 and 90 unwanted ships to use as targets, some captured from the enemy and some of the Navy's own. Since the Gilliam class had an inferior transport and cargo capacity to many of the other attack transport classes, it was an obvious candidate for disposal. 17 of the Gilliam class were duly selected to act as targets in the tests. In the event, one - - was reprieved, so exactly half of the class' 32 ships were designated as targets. Of these, a few were sunk by the atomic bombs themselves, while a number of others which received heavy doses of radiation were examined for a period before being disposed of in target practice in 1947 or 1948. A few were found to have mostly escaped the radioactive fallout and were taken back to the United States. These survivors, along with the rest of the class, were decommissioned in late 1946-early 1947 and saw no further service with the Navy (although it is unknown whether some may have been later sold for commercial service). The sole exception was , which although decommissioned along with the remainder of the class, remained in use with the Navy as a training ship until 1 September 1968. Many of the ships saw little service before being scrapped, many were uses as target ships. In fiction The 1956 movie Away All Boats presents operations on an attack transport. It was based on a popular novel of the same name, written by an officer who served on one during World War 2.AWAY ALL BOATS See also *Haskell-class attack transport Footnotes  References  See the individual ship entries at DANFS Online (APA-57 to APA-88).

Totternhoe Stone is a relatively hard chalk outcropping in the middle of the Lower Chalk in the Chiltern Hills in Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, England. Geologically, it is located in the upper part of the Cenomanian stage of the Cretaceous. Unusually among chalks, it is sufficiently strong for use as a building stone, and has been used as such in these localities, notably in Woburn Abbey, Luton parish church and several smaller local churches. It weathers rather badly in external use, but when used as internal carved decoration, it has remained in good condition for centuries. Old decorative carving is to be found in St Albans Abbey and in the altar screen of Westminster Abbey. The Totternhoe Stone is underlain by the argillaceous Chalk Marl. Above is the less argillaceous Grey Chalk. The bed varies in thickness from 0.5 to 5 metres. The stone, although fine-grained, is siliceous, and partial cementing with silica accounts for its relative hardness. It forms a distinct escarpment at several locations at the base of the Chiltern ridge, notably at Totternhoe, Bedfordshire , where it is at its thickest. In addition to use as a building stone, in the past it was used in the manufacture of a hydraulic lime, and in cement manufacture at three cement plants. Quarrying The stone has been quarried north of Totternhoe village in the county of Bedfordshire. It was quarried at Totternhoe Knolls, and to the east of the Knolls there were underground mines for the stone. The area from where the medieval tunnels were dug is now designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Totternhoe Chalk Quarry, as an example of chalk grassland.Natural England, Totternhoe Chalk Quarry. It is managed as a nature reserve by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.Wildlife Trust, Totternhoe Knolls and Totternhoe Quarry. In recent times the stone has been quarried in an area between the Knolls and the mines. This has been designated an SSSI called Totternhoe Stone Pit, as a Geological Conservation Review site.Natural England, Totternhoe Stone Pit. The Stone is quarried by a family run business, H.G Clarke and Son. This was started in 1920 by Herbert G.Clarke. It was then passed to his son Stanley W.Clarke and is now being run by his son Angus J.Clarke. H.G Clarke and Son are the main suppliers of this rare English stone. References Further reading * E.

Beginning his career as an actor at the end of the silent era, Tulio turned to directing and producing in the 1930s. His films are noted for their extremely melodramatic style.Village Voice: BAM Samples Finland's Teuvo Tulio\\"How did Theodor Tugai turn into Teuvo Tulio?\\" at Embassy of Finland, RigaThe Auteurs: The Strange Loves of Teuvo Tulio Biography Tulio was born as Theodor Antonius Tugai to a Turkish-Polish father and Persian-Latvian mother in Rƒìzekne, in the Vitebsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Latvia). Tugai spent the early part of his childhood in Latvia with his grandparents, before moving with his mother, who had married a Finn, to Helsinki. At age fourteen, Tugai was the star of his fellow Russian expatriate, eighteen-years-old Valentin Vaala's film Mustat silm√§t (Black Eyes), which was completed in 1929. Due to his \\"exotic\\" appearance, the young Tugai was sometimes referred to as Finland's answer to Rudolph Valentino. In 1936 he changed his name to the more Finnish Teuvo Tulio. His first work as director was the 1936 film Taistelu Heikkil√§n talosta (Fight over the Heikkila Mansion), starring Regina Linnanheimo. Linnanheimo would become Tulio's lifelong companion, though the two were never married. She acted as the leading lady in many of his films and co-wrote the screenplays for six of his features, including his last film, 1973's Sensuela. Linnanheimo wrote the screenplay to Rikollinen nainen (The Crooked Woman) and to Olet mennyt minun vereeni (You've Gone in My Blood). Altogether, Tulio directed 15 feature films, three of which were destroyed in a fire in 1959. Parts of two of the films have been found in 2007 and in 2015. =Later influence and reputation= Tulio's films were an influence on the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurism√§ki, whose admiration brought the filmmaker international attention later in his life. In 2008 and 2009, short retrospectives of his work were held in the United States at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Pacific Film Archive. Covering the former for the Village Voice, film critic J. Hoberman wrote: \\"At once arty and artless, stark and fulsome, Cine Tulio is characterized by an exaggerated emotional intensity and an equally primal lack of self-consciousness ... His movies are desperate and insistent, sometimes clumsy but never less than forceful. Tulio's strenuous lyricism allows the objective correlative to run wild.\\" In a brief essay on the filmmaker for the English-language film website The Auteurs, Anna Bak-Kvapil referred to Tulio's work as \\"spectacles of suffering and sex,\\" writing: \\"His style can be Eisensteinian, with expressionistic montages of the shining faces of the proletariat intercut with kittens, crucifixes, or half-smoked cigarettes, but he adores Hollywood, mimicking in his own over-enthusiastic way, Cukor, Lubitsch and Von Sternberg.\\"  Filmography  =Director= .

Neilson was nominated by President George W. Bush on February 14, 2005, to a seat vacated by Cornelia G. Kennedy. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 27, 2005, and received commission on November 9, 2005. Neilson's service was terminated on January 25, 2006, due to death.  Background  Neilson was born August 27, 1956 in Ann Arbor, Michigan and was a lifelong Michigan resident. In 1977, she received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in political science from the University of Michigan Honors College. Neilson received her Juris Doctor in 1980 from Wayne State University Law School. Following graduation she practiced products liability, commercial litigation, medical malpractice, and general negligence law with the firm of Dickinson Wright in Detroit, making partner in 1986. In 1991, Governor John Engler appointed Neilson to the 3rd Judicial Circuit of Michigan, part of the Wayne County Circuit Court, to which she was elected in 1992, and re-elected in 1996, and 2002. Neilson's chambers were in the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center (formerly the City-County Building) in downtown Detroit. While on the bench, Neilson co-wrote and co- edited Michigan Civil Procedure, a two-volume treatise on Michigan civil practice. Neilson was married with two daughters (Elizabeth, Born in 1984 and Mary, Born in 1990). She was an active Roman Catholic and was a member of the Detroit Catholic Lawyers Society.  Sixth Circuit nomination and confirmation  Neilson was nominated to a Michigan seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by President George W. Bush on November 8, 2001, to replace Judge Cornelia Groefsema Kennedy, who had taken senior status in 1999. On the same day, Bush also nominated Henry Saad and David McKeague to Michigan seats on the Sixth Circuit. On June 26, 2002, Bush nominated Richard Allen Griffin to a fourth Michigan seat on the Sixth Circuit. During the Democrat-controlled 107th Congress, all four nominations were stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee by then-chairman, Senator Patrick Leahy, D-VT. In the 2002 midterm congressional elections, the Republicans regained control of the Senate. During the new 108th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch, R-UT, the new Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee began to process the previously blocked four nominees. In March 2003, Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow announced that they would blue-slip all Bush judicial nominees from Michigan because Bush refused to renominate Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis, two Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit whose nominations the Senate Republicans had refused to process during President Bill Clinton's second term. Helene White was, at the time, married to Levin's cousin. Contrary to Levin's and Stabenow's wishes, Hatch gave Saad, McKeague and Griffin committee hearings, and passed the three nominees out of committee. Furious, Levin and Stabenow convinced their caucus to filibuster the three in order to prevent them from having confirmation votes. The Senate Republicans increased their numbers in the 109th Congress. Tensions between the Republicans and Democrats rose dramatically as the Republicans sought to break the filibusters of ten Bush court of appeals nominees (including Saad, McKeague and Griffin) by using the nuclear option. In order to defuse the explosive situation concerning the use of the nuclear option and Democrats' obstruction of President Bush's judicial nominations, fourteen moderate Republican and Democratic senators called the Gang of 14 joined together to forge an agreement to guarantee certain filibustered nominations up or down votes. Henry Saad and William Myers, however, were expressly excluded from the guarantee. After the Gang of 14 agreement in the Senate in 2005, Neilson finally received a floor vote in the Senate on October 27, 2005. (Fellow Michigan Sixth Circuit nominees Richard Allen Griffin and David McKeague received confirmation votes in June.) She was confirmed unanimously, 97-0, with both Michigan senators ultimately voting in her favor. Her confirmation came almost exactly four years after her initial nomination. Neilson was the seventh judge nominated to the Sixth Circuit by Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate.  Illness and death  After being nominated by Bush, Neilson learned that she had myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare blood disorder that eventually required her to undergo a bone marrow transplant in 2003. Though greatly diminished physically, Neilson returned to work and, following confirmation, moved her chambers to the federal courthouse in Detroit. On January 25, 2006, Neilson succumbed to the lingering effects of her illness, and died of lung failure in Detroit at the age of 49. Due to her illness and death, Neilson served for only two months on the Sixth Circuit and never wrote any opinions. According to an order of the court published in January 2006, Neilson participated in a decision to rehear a case en banc. The order does not indicate whether Neilson voted for or against rehearing. Neilson was survived by her husband and two daughters.  Epilogue  After her death, in June 2006, President Bush nominated Stephen J. Murphy III, the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, as Neilson's replacement. When Levin and Stabenow again balked in the 110th Congress at confirming any more Bush judicial nominees for Michigan, his nomination was withdrawn and replaced with that of failed Clinton nominee Helene White, now divorced from Levin's cousin.

Symptoms  Initial symptoms appear as small brown spots on the crown roots, the lower sheath, and the subcrown internode. This spots will elongate and coalesce and can cause an extensive brown discoloration at the crown, and the entire length of the subcrown internode. Healthy root tissue is white to slightly cream-colored.  Disease cycle  In western Canada, infections occur mainly from soil-borne spores, whereas in eastern Canada, seed-borne inoculum is more important. The spores can survive for many years, and germinate in the presence of susceptible plants. At infected plants reach maturity, abundant sporulation occurs.  Management  Disease inoculum is reduced by long rotations with nonhost crops. Shallow seeding and optimum fertilization levels, especially of phosphate and potassium, reduce disease severity. Resistance cultivars are also available.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Ryan Cawdor, his son Dean, Krysty Wroth, J.B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, Mildred Wyeth, and Michael Brother arrive in a MAT-TRANS chamber which appears unusually constructed. The normally seamless bulletproof glass windows are badly aligned, along with the doors, and the exterior control chamber appears to be a hastily constructed chamber carved from an existing cave, with chisel marks still showing in the surrounding granite. The atmosphere outside is heavy and foggy, and in addition to preventing J.B. from putting his sextant to use the fog also seems to interfere with both compasses and electronic equipment, including watches. The companions venture out cautiously into the barren surroundings, encountering a variety of highly mutated insect-like creatures, as well as a few sources of water, including a fast-flowing stream. All are tainted with an unknown substance that causes an unpleasant stinging on contact, and thus clearly undrinkable. Eventually the companions arrive at surprisingly intact town, which is revealed to be an \\"Old West\\" themed reconstruction called Lonesome Gulch. In short order the companions are surrounded by a large group of flying reptilian creatures, and after the companions take shelter in the town's General Store the creatures attack. J.B. and Ryan rig a crude timed explosive, then wait with the others in the store's root cellar; when the explosives detonate the companions flee in the ensuing confusion, though Ryan is wounded by one of the creatures. The companions make it to the MAT-TRANS chamber and make the jump. Ryan and his friends arrive in a familiar redoubt, and after some exploration conclude that it is a redoubt in Louisiana, where they initially met Jak Lauren. However, rather than the wet Louisiana bayou they are expecting, the group finds the area outside the redoubt is a barren, flat, lifeless desert. Furthermore, Ryan and J.B.'s radiation detectors show the area is dangerously radioactive, forcing them back inside before they can investigate a cause for the sudden change in the terrain. With no resources in the redoubt, the group reluctantly makes a third jump. When the companions arrive in the next chamber they find that Ryan, Doc, and Michael are all unconscious. After some time Doc comes around, but Ryan manages only to regain consciousness briefly before passing out again. Most troubling is Michael, who regains consciousness only to attack Doc ferociously, claiming he is Satan. Michael is subdued and restrained; the group concludes that Michael has been driven to psychosis by the back-to-back jumps, but have no idea if he will recover. When Mildred examines Ryan she notes that his wound is obviously infected, presumably with some kind of poison, and needs to be sterilized. The companions head into the redoubt, finding it thoroughly cleared out but locating a sterile medical facility. With no other options Mildred sterilizes Ryan's wound with a superheated knife, with the rest of the group holding Ryan down due to a lack of any anesthesia. Partway through the process Michael regains consciousness, no longer psychotic, and helps restrain Ryan. The procedure is successful, and Ryan begins to recover. The next day the companions set out from the redoubt, having found ample water but no food. J.B.'s sextant places them in New England, and Doc recognizes the nearby lake as Lake Champlain. The companions find a man's corpse, as well as one of a stickie (a vicious breed of mutant), and further evidence of stickie activity. Sometime later they encounter three people searching for their friend, who they identify as the corpse. Saddened, but grateful for knowing their friend's fate, the young people invite the companions back to their ville, Quindley. Quindley is immediately recognized as an unusual ville: the residents are all strict vegetarians, and the ville does not have a Baron, but rather an unseen (behind a one-way mirror), \\"all- knowing\\" leader calling himself Moses. Furthermore, the ville's residents react strangely to most of the companions, save for Michael and Dean, and Doc notes that none of Quindley's inhabitants appear older than 25. This is confirmed by the ville's second in command, Jehu, who when pressed further reveals that once someone turns 25 they are ritualistically executed. The companions are not subject to this, and Jehu commands that they be treated as guests. This is met with disapproval, to the point where Jehu kills one of Quindley's residents after he in turn attempts to kill Doc. Quindley is shown to have other problems as well. Though warned of stickies being present in the area, the ville's guards do not alter their patrols, as Moses has not authorized it. This results in the deaths of four children when stickies attack a group near the edge of town. Ryan and his friends kill the stickies before they can kill any more. Quindley's residents also attempt to convince Dean and Michael to stay permanently; a woman named Dorothy is particularly successful with Michael, fostering a romantic and sexual attachment between the two. The woman's allure is strong enough that, after showing him two prisoners awaiting execution and kept in narrow cages which force them to stand, Dorothy convinces Michael to have sex with her in front of them as a form of torture. The following night the prisoners are ritually executed by being burned alive. During the execution stickies attack the ville, and using a large fire and a smaller force as a distraction manage to capture more than a dozen of the ville's children, along with Krysty, Mildred, Doc, and Dean. When Ryan offers Moses assistance in recovering the children Moses refuses, saying that no rescue attempt will be made. The remaining companions discuss the matter and decide to steal one of the ville's boats and set out after the stickies the next morning. Michael joins them sometime later and volunteers to come along, which they accept. That morning Ryan and his friends steal a boat without incident and set off for where they believe the stickie camp is located. There they find a group of at least 30 stickies, who have already started killing the captive children. Though it is a difficult task they manage to kill the entire contingent of mutants, freeing their friends and the surviving children. At Michael's request the group returns to Quindley in the hopes of convincing Dorothy to accompany them. Unknown to them, Moses had previously ordered they be executed that morning during breakfast, and following their disappearance has ordered their death should they return. Ryan and his friends search for Dorothy unsuccessfully but without incident, and eventually arrive at Moses' temple. There they find both Dorothy and Jehu mostly naked, bearing teeth and whip marks as well as other signs of recent sexual abuse. Jehu attempts to kill Doc but is shot before he can, and his body knocks a torch into a nearby tapestry, starting a large fire. Doc then shoots through the one-way mirror hiding Moses, shattering it, revealing him to be a bedridden, grossly obese mutant dwarf. The companions take Dorothy and leave the temple, allowing Moses to burn alive, and are able to exit Quindley without incident. The companions make it to the redoubt safely, and with some coaxing convince Dorothy to enter the MAT-TRANS chamber. Ryan starts the jump, but partway through Dorothy panics and tries to leave the chamber. Ryan is unable to move, and passes out as he watches an already-fading Michael attempt to stop Dorothy. In the epilogue, a traveling merchant arrives at the ruins of Quindley some weeks later. The ville has burned to the ground, the temple fire having spread to the other buildings, and its residents have fled the area or died. The merchant takes out a note he was given, to be delivered to men named J.B. Dix and Ryan Cawdor, a note given to him by Abe and the Trader telling the men to meet them in Seattle. The merchant drops the note into the water, remarking to himself that if the Trader asks, he can say he at least tried.

It was reorganized from the 77th Special Forces Group, which was also stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 7th Group‚Äîas it is sometime called‚Äîis designed to deploy and execute nine doctrinal missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, counter-insurgency, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, information operations, counterproliferation of weapon of mass destruction, and security force assistance.Army Special Operations Forces Fact Book 2018 , USASOC official website, dated 2018, last accessed 28 July 2019 The 7th SFG(A) spends much of its time conducting foreign internal defense, counter-drug, and training missions of friendly governments' armed forces in South, Central, and North America as well as the Caribbean. 7th SFG(A) participated in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983, and in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989. The 7th SFG(S) has, like all the SFGs, been heavily deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in the War on Terror. History =World War II= The 7th SFG(A) traces its lineage to the 1st Company, 1st Regiment, 1st Special Service Force, which was established on 9 July 1942 at Fort William Henry Harrison, Montana. The unit was a combined Canadian-American commando unit, designed to conduct raids against Germany's fledgling nuclear capability in northern Europe. However, it was relocated to the Aleutian Islands to fight the Japanese. Upon the successful completion of the Aleutian campaign, the FSSF was transferred to the Mediterranean theater of operations. The unit earned the nickname \\"The Devil's Brigade\\" for fighting with distinction at the Anzio beachhead in Italy. It was the first Allied unit to enter Rome in June 1944. The commander of the 1st Regiment, Colonel Alfred C. Marshall, was killed in action leading that assault. The Force next served as an amphibious spearhead for the Allied landings in southern France in August 1944. The high rate of casualties from these campaigns made it necessary to disband the First Special Service Force at Menton, France on 5 December 1944. =77th Special Forces Group= The 77th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, NC on 10 November 1953 under command of Lieutenant Colonel Jack T. Shannon. Its motto was \\"Any Thing, Any Time, Any Place, Any How.\\" The group built rapidly from an initial strength of only 200 soldiers. The 77th Group wore their famous Green Beret headgear for the first time in a retirement parade for XVIII Airborne Corps commander MG Joseph P. Cleland in June, 1955. In the fall of 1955 it deployed into OPERATION SAGEBRUSH in Louisiana, the largest military exercise in the US since World War II. The 77th carried out unconventional warfare operations, the first time this had been employed in a US military exercise. In 1955-56, 77th Group conducted two cycles of mountain warfare training at Camp Hale, Colorado known as EXERCISE LODESTAR ABLE and LODESTAR BAKER. In April 1956 the 77th Special Forces Group transferred four detachments to the Pacific theater to serve as the cadre for the 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), which activated at Okinawa in June 1957. In 1959, teams from the 77th Special Forces Group began to deploy to Laos under Project Hotfoot in an effort to forestall Communist encroachment in that kingdom. The group also deployed teams to South Vietnam in 1960 to train Vietnamese ranger and special forces personnel. =Reorganization as 7th Group= In 1960, the 77th was reorganized and redesignated as the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces. In the 1960s, the need for mobile training teams exceeded the capability of the US military, so the 7th Group provided the cadre for the 3rd Special Forces Group (United States) and the 6th Special Forces Group (United States). =Vietnam= The 7th Group was active early in the Vietnam War, first operating in Laos (Operation White Star), and later in other global Cold War operations in addition to Southeast Asia (Laos, Thailand, and South Vietnam). 7th Group was the first unit in South Vietnam to have a member earn a Medal of Honor, Captain Roger Donlon. =Latin America= At the same time, Special Forces were expanding into Latin America. In May 1962, the advance party from Company D, 7th Special Forces Group departed for Fort Gulick, Panama, in the Canal Zone, to establish the 8th Special Forces Group. 8th Group was deactivated in 1972 and the unit redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group. The entire 7th Special Forces Group was scheduled for inactivation on 1 October 1980, and was unfunded after that in the completed and approved US Army POM. Army Chief of Staff General Edward C. Meyers reversed the decision after USSOUTHCOM briefings and discussions with LTG Wallace H. Nutting, the CINCSOUTH, and LTC Charles Fry, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group commander, regarding the growing threat to Central America and the need for U.S. Army Special Forces to respond to the threat. Throughout the 1980s, 7th Special Forces Group played a critical advisory role for the Salvadoran armed forces, which grew from a force of 12,000 to a total of 55,000 men. The Salvadoran military became a highly trained counter- insurgency force under the tutelage of 7th Group. Due to the success of special forces in El Salvador, the 3rd Special Forces Group was reactivated in 1990. The 7th Special Forces Group played an important role in preparing the Honduran military to resist and defeat an invasion from Nicaragua. 7th Group also trained the Honduran military in counter-insurgency tactics, which enabled Honduras to defeat the Honduran communist-backed guerrillas. 7th Special Forces Group also became involved in counter narcotics operations in the Andean Ridge countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The goal was not just to stop the flow of drugs into the United States, but to stem the violence that resulted from the drug trade in those countries. During the 3 October 1989 coup against Noriega by some of his troops, members of 7th Group conducted reconnaissance operations near the road that led from the cuartel of Battalion 2000 to Panama City, giving the US Southern Command advanced early warning of the elite Panamanian unit moving to rescue Noriega, who was being held captive in the Panamanian Comandancia. Meanwhile, one 7th Group Company was being readied to take custody of Noriega. When the coup was over and Noriega was released, that company prepared a raid on the Carcelo Modelo where American Kurt Muse was being held for operating an illegal radio station that was broadcasting anti-Noriega programming. That mission was later turned over to 1st SFOD-D and performed on D-Day during Operation Just Cause. From 19 December 1989 to 31 January 1990, elements of the 7th Special Forces Group participated in Operation Just Cause to restore democracy to Panama. The 7th Group conducted combat operations on D-Day against multiple strategic targets. Over the next two weeks, 7th Special Forces Group conducted many reconnaissance and direct action missions in support of the operation. When combat operations ceased, Operational Detachments-A and -B fanned out over the entire country, living in villages with the people. 7th Group soldiers restored public utilities such as water and power while maintaining a watch on the (then) new Panamanian Police Force. Non-commissioned officers served as temporary judges and mayors gaining enormous support from the populace. =Global War on Terrorism= Since early 2002, the 7th SFG has deployed almost nonstop in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. 7th SFG along with the 3rd Special Forces Group are the two SFGs responsible for conducting operations in Afghanistan. The Group has also deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom numerous times, but not as often as Afghanistan. The 7th SFG has lost more SF soldiers in the Global War on Terrorism than any other SFG. =Relocation= In 2011, 7th SFG(A) relocated from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The current Group Commander as of July 2019 is COL John W. Sannes, who had wide experience in the 3rd Special Forces Group (United States).

He served in his second term serving the 83rd House District of Michigan. This district comprises all Sanilac County and a portion of St. Clair County including the City of Port Huron, Michigan. Espinoza is one of only three Hispanics in the Michigan legislature at that time. Early life Espinoza spent his early years working in the cotton fields of Texas with his father Leto and brothers Erasmo and Pepe. His mother Leta and sister Estela took care of the homefront. Eventually the family moved to Sanilac County, Michigan when Espinoza was still young. In Michigan, they continued working in the farm fields as well as in area orchards; tending to such crops as sugar beets, cucumbers, and apples.  Education  Espinoza attended Croswell- Lexington High School. He earned his associate degree from the Central Texas College and his Bachelor of Science Degree from the University of the State of New York.

He also worked on the staff of Michigan State Senator Jim Barcia when Mr. Barcia was a United States Democratic Congressman from Michigan. Espinoza held the position of Military Affairs and Community Outreach Liaison for Congressman Barcia .

He was easily re-elected in 2006 and now serves as the chair of the Agricultural Appropriations Committee.  As An Educator  Upon his return to Michigan in the late 1990s Espinoza also worked as a teacher in the Carsonville-Port Sanilac, Michigan School District.

He earned his teaching certification from Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Michigan.  Media Highlights  Espinoza was also the inaugural producer and host of the pioneering mid Michigan Public Broadcasting System television show Somos Hispanos; broadcast from the campus of Delta College in Bay City, Michigan. He interviewed many important Hispanic figures including Public Broadcasting System news anchor Ray Suarez and actor/ activist Edward James Olmos. Espinoza received many accolades for his excellent work. He left the show to run successfully for the Michigan State House. Espinoza has shared his insights via regular programs on Sanilac, Michigan County radio station WMIC and written contributions to the Sanilac County News and the Port Huron Times-Herald. America's Son - the Odyssey of John Espinoza In 2006, Ray W. Denison published a book about John Espinoza's life, America's Son - the Odyssey of John Espinoza.

Overview An Opal release, with no catalogue number, this title is only available from EnoShop. The music on the album was made for an Installation - a show featuring music and visuals - that took place at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's \\"010101: Art in Technological Times\\" exhibition which opened on 3 March 2001. His piece was titled New Urban Spaces Series #4: \\"Compact Forest Proposal\\". Since then, the museum has acquired the Installation for its permanent collection. The piece was installed in a dark room, featuring strings of tiny white lights rising to the ceiling from gossamer pods that reminded Eno of \\"jellyfish\\", while his music played. \\"It's an idea for a kind of retreat people can go to in the city\\". Part of Eno's Quiet Club series of Installations, he described it as a sort of \\"simulated forest\\" of the future. He gave it a \\"deliberately clunky\\" title \\"because I want it to be like an architectural submission for a new space.\\" The CD notes explain > \\"There are 10 active CD players in this installation. Each is playing a > specially cut CD, a single layer of the total music. The CDs have different > numbers of tracks, some of which are silent, and each player is set to play > these tracks in random order.

The music can be seen as a \\"sequel\\" to his Music for Civic Recovery Centre album (2000) as it continues to explore variations on the same tracks that were featured there, ie Ikebukuro, from his 1992 album The Shutov Assembly and Kites II & Kites III from his 1999 album Kite Stories; this is particularly true on the longest piece.

Until his death, he worked for Pimlico Plumbers, a plumbing company in southeast London, as a van cleaner, and refused to take a day off on the day he celebrated what he claimed was his 100th birthday. He also received coverage in the media for fending off an attack from a group of youths in 2007; he was cited by the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell as \\"living proof of why people should not be written off once they pass retirement age\\". Martin stated that he would not retire from working. Doubts have been raised about all of Martin's historical claims, including his age, which may have in truth been 97 at the time of his death. Biography In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, Martin claimed to have been born \\"up in the hills of the Basque Country\\" in France. He stated that his mother fell pregnant to a member of the affluent family she served, and he and his mother were smuggled to Britain to avoid the disgrace. His mother was put in a convent and he was placed in an orphanage near Bodmin in Cornwall, run by the Sisters of Mercy, when he was three months old. Martin says that he picked up his nickname \\"Buster\\" at age three for \\"whacking a priest on the nose\\". He travelled to London, and found work running errands for stallholders in the Brixton market, the beginning of nearly 90 years of work. He reputedly met his future wife, Iriana, a native of Tonbridge, Kent, when he was 13 and she was 12. He claimed that they were married a year later in France. Martin stated: \\"I got married in 1920 and had to go over to France as I couldn't get married here due to my legal status.\\" However, the legal age for contracting marriage in France at the time was 18 for a boy and 15 for a girl, with the consent of their parents, or 21 without the consent of father and mother. The couple stayed together for 35 years until Iriana reportedly died in 1955, although no death certificate has been uncovered. They reportedly had 17 children, born between 1921 and 1934: \\"twins, triplets, singletons - all sorts\\", among them Roberto, Rodrigues, and triplets named Georgina, Georgia and Giselle, but again no record of their births could be found. Martin claimed that they all moved abroad. He claimed to have left Brixton market aged 14, and joined the British Army, where he became a physical training instructor. He served in World War II, leaving the Armed Forces in 1955 after reaching the rank of regimental sergeant major. After time spent in various other jobs, he returned to the market, where he worked until he was 97. After complaining of boredom, he resumed work, starting at Pimlico Plumbers in London working three days a week, three months before his claimed 100th birthday.Iggulden, Amy. \\"Buster groomed to become king of rock 'n' old\\". The Daily Telegraph. 30 May 2007 On Martin's claimed centenary, his employer suggested that he take the day off to celebrate. However, he turned up for work. His colleagues threw him a surprise party at the company's headquarters and organized a tour of Chelsea F.C.'s Stamford Bridge ground. Until 2006, Martin claimed never to have taken a day off for sickness in his ninety years of work, until an ingrown toenail forced him to take a few months' leave of work. On 22 February 2007, while walking to a bus stop from a local pub, Martin was attacked by three youths from behind. Their assault caused him to fall, but he managed to defend himself; he said that he \\"hit one in the groin and kicked another one\\". The youths ran off; Martin made his way to King's College Hospital, where he was kept in overnight. He reported for work the next morning, but his bosses refused to let him work. Martin stated that he would \\"only give up [working] when they put me in a wooden box\\". He also offered his view on older workers: \\"Employers should pick people like us; we want to work and it puts money in our pockets and keeps us active\\". His boss, Charlie Mullins, stated in an interview with a French TV station that they use Buster in all their publicity and managed to increase their business by 36% thanks to his popularity and the media interest. Martin died on 12 April 2011 at the claimed age of 104. The Zimmers Through the intervention of celebrity publicist Max Clifford, Martin joined The Zimmers, a band consisting of forty old age pensioners. The group was put together by BBC film maker Tim Samuels for a documentary on the marginalisation of older people in Britain. The Zimmers shot to fame in 2007 with their cover of The Who's \\"My Generation\\". Martin also accepted a position on men's magazine FHM as an \\"agony uncle,\\" offering advice to the magazine's readers. London Marathon 2008 After walking the distance of the Great Capital Run in 2 hours 22 minutes and the Roding Valley Half Marathon in 5 hours 13 minutes, Martin was entered for the 2008 London Marathon. According to press reports, he walked the 26-mile course in approximately 10 hours. The official London Marathon 2008 Results list shows intermediate results for 5 km, 10 km and 15 km but no finishing time for Martin's race number of 32858. His four minders - Harmander Singh (32857), Samm Mullins (32856), Anil K Gupta (51611) and Mirmal Singh Lotay (23984) - are officially listed with a finishing time of 9 hours 59 minutes. If the claims about his age were true, he would have been the oldest recorded marathon participant in the world. However, officials of the Guinness World Records organisation said that they did not consider Martin eligible for the record because he had never provided proof of the date of his birth. Robert Young, an independent senior consultant for gerontology for Guinness World Records stated that his sources had told him that Martin had two birth dates registered with the British NHS: 1 September 1906, and 1 September 1913, the latter of which would have made him 94 years old at the time. (page 2) London bookmakers William Hill refused to pay out ¬£13,300 in alleged winnings for two bets which had been placed on Martin's marathon efforts and would have benefitted the Rhys Daniels Trust. The bookmakers demand a birth certificate as proof of age, stating that other documents like a passport or a naturalisation certificate are only \\"proof of nationality\\" and, in this case, based on \\"self-certification\\". The Los Angeles Times reported on 12 April 2008 that Martin \\"follows a diligent regimen of beer, cigarettes and red meat\\".

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis The novel opens with Ryan Cawdor resting in a box canyon in New Mexico, a few feet from Jak Lauren. Ryan notes the heavy sadness affecting Jak, sadness he shares. The reason is revealed when the two arise and have a brief moment at three new graves nearby: the graves of Jak's wife Christina, his infant daughter Jenny, and Ryan's traveling companion Michael Brother. The narrative then moves to a few days prior. Ryan, his son Dean, Krysty Wroth, J.B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, Mildred Wyeth, and Michael Brother arrive from their latest MAT-TRANS jump. When Ryan awakes he discovers Michael crying, bitterly depressed over the absence of Dorothy, a woman the companions tried to bring with them from their last destination, but who panicked and fled as the jump started. This simply adds to Michael's already growing depression over his life in the Deathlands, and the companions decide to let him deal with his emotions as he sees fit, but with the understanding to keep an eye on him should he turn dangerous. Several of the companions recognize the color of the jump chamber walls, and Dean identifies it as the New Mexico redoubt, placing them near Jak Lauren's ranch. The companions set out for the ranch, and in a matter of hours are reunited with Jak Lauren and his family. Christina is still less than pleased to see Ryan, owing to her husband's near death during Ryan's last visit, but agrees to let the group stay for a few days. The next four days pass peacefully and pleasantly. On the fourth day most of the companions set out, accompanying Jak on a day-trip to hunt deer. Michael opts to stay behind and help Christina care for Jenny and do other chores, part of his efforts over the past days to break out of his depression. The group sets off, and eventually find and kill two deer. As they are dressing them Krysty has a prophetic vision (an ability she has as a mutant) strongly foretelling death, although it is vague and without detail. Assuming the worst, the companions set off quickly for the Lauren ranch. As they approach they see a large group of horses riding away from the ranch. When they finally arrive Jak finds his wife in the kitchen, dead, murdered after being raped and tortured. J.B. finds Jenny in one of the barns, also dead, having been thrown violently against a wall. Michael is nowhere to be found. The companions help Jak clean up the bodies of his wife and daughter, in order to prepare them for burial. Sometime after they finish, Michael is found praying in front of the corpses. After some effort the group manages to get him to respond to them, and with further prompting he tells them what happened. While the rest of the group was away hunting, Michael spotted a large dust trail in the distance, indicating people moving towards the Lauren farm. Christina didn't seem in any way alarmed by the news, so Michael continued performing various chores around the ranch. Eventually two armored wags arrived at the Lauren ranch, but it was only when numerous, heavily armed, uniformed men and women exited the vehicles that Michael knew something was wrong. Unarmed and heavily outnumbered, Michael was unable to act against the uniformed group, and instead hid in a nearby pile of hay. Several men took Christina into the house, presumably to rape her. After Christina severely wounded one of her rapists with a concealed knife other members of the group killed Jenny in retaliation. The armed group then executed Christina and left quickly, fleeing a group of Native Americans approaching on horseback. Michael fled into the hills, overcome with guilt. The companions' reactions to Michael's story is mixed; Jak is furious with Michael for not trying to save his wife and child, though Ryan and J.B. maintain that any attempt on Michael's part would have simply resulted in his death without saving Jak's family. Ryan also notes that the horsemen they saw on approach were not the attackers and were presumably hunting the uniformed group as well, something they would not have known without Michael's account. Based on Michael's description, Jak tentatively identifies the attackers' leader as the General, a vicious raider rumored to prey on Native American communities and isolated settlements in the area. The companions make plans to bury Christina and Jenny the following day, then head out in pursuit of the General. Meanwhile, near Seattle, Abe is still with the Trader, waiting in the hopes that J.B. and Ryan will meet up with them, as Abe has sent a message to do so with several traveling merchants. Abe has spent the past five weeks with the Trader, and has noticed that his former employer seems changed. While the Trader is just as powerful and commanding as he was in the past, Abe is worried about a new streak of brutality he has noticed in the man's behavior. Abe keeps these observations to himself. The next day, the companions awake and find that Michael is not in his room. They initially assume he has simply left the ranch, but he is discovered in the barn, dead, having hanged himself. Inside his room Dean finds a suicide note, which Doc reads aloud to the rest of the group. In it, Michael explains that he is not killing himself simply out of guilt, but also due to his worsening depression over the past few weeks, which he attributes to the bleak life found in the Deathlands. He then says goodbye to each of the companions individually, and asks Jak for forgiveness; Jak bitterly confesses to the rest that he had already forgiven Michael. With Jak's approval the group bury Michael alongside Christina and Jenny in a remote box canyon. Afterward they stock up on supplies at the ranch and head out on horseback in pursuit of the General. The companions camp for the evening in the abandoned ville of Opium Wells. During the night Dean is ambushed while urinating and briefly threatened for information on the rest of the group, which is cut short when Ryan and his friends surround the ambushers. Once Dean states that they are hunting the General the ambushers reveal they are Navaho, also hunting the General for a recent attack on one of their settlements. A tense truce is established, and the Navaho release Dean. After further discussion the Navaho agree to travel alongside Ryan and his friends, to better their chances of catching and killing the General. The truce between the two groups is soon tested when, the following evening, they come across one of the General's wags which has become stuck in the mud. At Jak's suggestion they start a small fire near the wag in order to make its occupants believe the Navaho intend to burn them alive inside the vehicle. The stranded raiders flee the vehicle and are killed. However, when one of the Navaho looks inside the vehicle they are grabbed by a lone remaining raider, who pulls the pin on an implosion grenade he is holding. Ryan is standing atop the vehicle as this happens, and closes the entrance hatch to contain the blast as he flees. The ensuing detonation batters Ryan but does not kill him, thanks to the hatch being closed, but the surviving Navaho claim Ryan's actions doomed their tribesman. A direct conflict between the two groups is narrowly avoided by mention of the General, but the Navaho vow to bring up the matter again once he has been dealt with. The two groups follow the path of the remaining wag back to the General's hideout, a natural attraction called the J.C. Wright Caverns. The groups leave their horses outside with Dean to guard over them, then head around the rise the caverns are situated in the hopes of finding a way in that doesn't require a frontal assault; the abandoned visitor's center proves to have a still-accessible stairway leading down into the caverns. Once inside Ryan and his friends prepare to make a covert assault on the General and his gang, but their plans go awry when two of the Navaho loudly charge a group of raiders (in order to battle \\"honorably\\") and are killed without inflicting a single casualty. Ryan and his friends are able to kill the small group of raiders, but not without alerting the General and the rest of his contingent that they are under attack. The rest of the Navaho move to make an attempt on Ryan's life, but he, J.B., and Jak have anticipated this and kill the Native Americans before they can fire a shot. The situation turns into a standoff, and the General eventually asks for a brief truce to discuss terms, which Ryan and J.B. agree to, temporarily. The General proposes he and his remaining gang be allowed to leave in the wag. Ryan has no intention of letting him leave alive, not the least reason being that he recognizes that the General is not just a brutal killer, but absolutely insane. Meanwhile, Jak has moved silently through the dark caverns and placed himself behind the General and his gang, and starts to kill raiders one by one. This starts a brief firefight which kills the rest of the raiders but allows the General to escape into the caverns. Rather than chase the General through the dark caves, the companions leave the caverns and wait for him to attempt to flee. Sometime later the General exits through the visitor's center, only to be stopped at gunpoint by Ryan and his friends. Jak then moves in on the seemingly unarmed General, quickly disarms him when he tries to pull a derringer, and then kills him with a knife through the eye. The companions then take the remaining wag and head back for the Lauren ranch. On the trip back the group spends the night in the small ville of Patriarch. The next morning at breakfast Ryan meets the town's only other guest, a traveling merchant. The merchant recognizes Ryan and, after some brief questions, gives him one of Abe's notes. Ryan shares the news of Abe's success in finding the Trader with the rest of the group, and he and J.B. decide to set out alone for Seattle after they return to the ranch.

Population: It is named after the former church of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. Yakimanka contains the western half of the historical Zamoskvorechye area (its eastern half is administered as Zamoskvorechye District proper), including the Tretyakov Gallery and the territories of Gorky Park and Neskuchny Sad. The boundary between Yakimanka and Zamoskvorechye districts follows Balchug Street and Bolshaya Ordynka Street (north of Garden Ring), Korovy Val and Mytnaya streets (south of Garden Ring). History 17th- century palace, Ordynsky Tupik. Writers' Apartments in the background =Old Muscovy= This section is based on P.V. Sytin's \\"–ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É–ª–∏—Ü\\" [From the history of Moscow streets], Moscow, 1948. Territories on the right (southern) bank of Moskva River, now known as Zamoskvorechye, were colonized from the fourteenth century. Two river crossings, west and east of the Kremlin walls, continued south to Kaluga and Serpukhov, and served as main axes of settlement. The western part of Yakimanka District (between the Moskva River and Bolshaya Yakimanka Street) was regularly flooded, and thus its inhabited area was contained within a 700-meter-wide tract of land between Bolshaya Yakimanka and Bolshaya Ordynka streets (formerly the Kaluga and Serpukhov roads). The floodland was gradually built out in the nineteenth century when the Babiegorodskaya Dam was completed, but even then a large field existed near Krymsky Bridge until 1972, when the new building of the Tretyakov Gallery was built. The clover leaves on the district's coat of arms are a memory of these fields. (See Balchug for an explanation of the Vodootvodny Canal flood control development that separated the Bersenevka and Boloto neighborhoods from the mainland and the history of the island.) The lands south of the Moskva River, exposed to southern enemies, were regularly destroyed by raiders, notably by Algirdas in 1366 and 1368, Tokhtamysh in 1382, Edigu in 1408, and the Tatar pretender Mazovsha in 1451. Permanent militarized settlements of Muscovites, called slobodas, were established by Prince Vasili III in the early sixteenth century. The fortified line on the site of the present-day Garden Ring was built in 1591‚Äì1592 in the reign of Feodor I. The church of St. Joachim and St. Anne at Bolshaya Yakimanka, 13, which gave the district its name, was initially built in 1493 and subsequently rebuilt before being destroyed by the Soviet government (see 19th century photo).I.K. Kondrat'ev, Sedaya starina Moskvy (Moscow: Citadel, 1997 repr. of 1893 book), pp. 402, 595. Yakimanka District has had a diverse and rapidly changing ethnic and social composition: *Continuous presence of Tatars since 14th century; Ordynka Street is named after the Golden Horde (in Russian, orda). Chernigov Lane was named in memory of Prince Mikhail of Chernigov, killed by the Horde and buried in the area. *16/17th-century settlement of foreign mercenaries employed by Vasili III, Ivan Grozny, and the early Romanovs. *17th-century settlement of former Polish prisoners of war who remained in Moscow after the Time of Troubles, known as Babiy Gorodok (–ë–∞–±–∏–π –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–∫, \\"women's town\\"). *A settlement of court translators (tolmachi), who dealt with foreign visitors (current Tolmachevsky Lanes). *16/17th-century settlements of Cossacks (current Kazachy Lanes) and Streltsy, dispersed after the Streltsy Uprising of 1698 (Pyzhevsky Lane, after the streltsy colonel Bogdan Pyzhov;Nina M.

September 30, 1698 Peter I hanged 36 soldiers at the Serpukhov Gate, 36 at the Kaluga Gate, etc., physically destroying the human core of the sloboda system. By 1720, all streltsy troops were disbanded. At the same time, craftsmen lost their businesses when the royal court relocated to Saint Petersburg. The patchwork sloboda system of Zamoskvorechye fell apart, and within the 18th century social diversity settled down. Bolshaya Yakimanka remained a quiet street of single-family households, many of them still farming on the floodlands; Bolshaya Ordynka was inhabited by wealthy merchants. Zamoskvorechye merchant became a catchword for an ultraconservative, bearded, pious archetype, the subject of Aleksandr Ostrovsky's plays. Even the wealthiest of them lived in country-style single-story houses on spacious lots, a few of which remain today. The areas on the edge of the city, where Peter hanged his soldiers, were taken over by grain warehouses and market squares, commemorated in the names of Zhitnaya (\\"wheat\\") and Mytnaya (\\"tax\\") streets. Bolshaya Ordynka, 16, one of remaining historical houses Yakimanka was established as an administrative district in 1782, when Catherine II divided Moscow into 20 police districts. In particular, Zamoskvorechye was divided between the Yakimanka and Pyatnitzkaya police precincts. A different development began at the end of the century on the Kaluga road outside the Garden Ring (which at that time was a city rampart, not a garden or a street). The present-day territory of Gorky Park and Neskuchny Sad, between the Kaluga road and the Moskva River, was home to the country houses of the Golitsyn, Demidov, Trubetskoy, Stroganov and later Orlov families. In 1793, Prince Dmitry Golitsyn bequeathed 900,000 roubles to build Moscow's first free public hospital. The project, supported by the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, was completed in 1796‚Äì1802 by Matvey Kazakov. Although the Golitsyn family owned lands nearby, the hospital was set on Stroganov family land. Hospital construction continued on Kaluga Road throughout the next century. Today, these hospitals belong to Yakimanka District and are known as First City (–ü–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –ì—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è). =19th century= This section is based on \\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –≤–µ–∫–∞\\" [Moscow builders at the turn of the century]Moscow: \\"O-–ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä\\", 2001 (). British Embassy in Boloto, facing Kremlin, originally Gustav List mansion Golutvin Sloboda offices, converted 19th century factories The Fire of 1812 swept the entire area except for a few blocks in the southern end of Bolshaya Yakimanka and Kazakov's hospital (which took care of both Russian and French troops). The construction of the Babiegorodskaya Dam and the clearing of the Vodootvodny Canal in the 1830s reduced the flood hazard, but the land remained cheap. This led to the steady industrialization of Zamoskvorechye. For example, Gustav List set up his first metalworking factory in Boloto, directly across from the Kremlin (his mansion, also in Boloto, would later house the British embassy). While most of Yakimanka remained a traditional, low-rise merchant neighborhood, a cluster of large five- to seven-story factory buildings emerged in Golutvin and Bersenevka (Golutvin was the birthplace of Pavel Ryabushinsky). Most of these are now converted to office space, while Krasny Oktyabr chocolate factory (originally Einem) is scheduled for conversion soon. Hotels catering to businesspeople were built nearby in Boloto and Balchug Street. In 1896, the city built an electrical power plant in Zamoskvorechye District (MOGES-1, the oldest existing power plant). The second power plant, built specifically for the tram network, emerged in Yakimanka District, also in Bersenevka, and operates today. Since that time, electrical and oiling offices are major tenants on the Balchug island. The late nineteenth century was also a time of charity and social experiments. The Tretyakov Gallery, which started as Pavel Tretyakov's private collection in the 1850s, opened to the public in 1892. The existing building, with a facade designed by Apollinary Vasnetsov, was completed in 1899‚Äì1904. Pavel Tretyakov also financed the construction and operation of the free housing for widows and children of Russian artists, located north from the Gallery. Morozov Hospital, the city's first surgical hospital for children, started in 1896 as a two-room Red Cross clinic. The Morozov family financed construction of the two-story existing building in Bolshaya Polyanka. Another free hospital was operated by the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent. Finally, the city and private philanthropists also provided cheap or free housing; the largest public housing projects were launched in the 1890s in Boloto. The best known of these projects, Bakhrushin Free Apartments (1898-1900, Sofiyskaya Embankment, 26),http://gctm.ru/museum/bakhrushin/ now houses Rosneft headquarters. =Modern history= Tretyakov Gallery, recently expanded In 1922, Bolshevik authorities closed and looted 22 churches in Zamoskvorechye, including the churches of St. Joachim and St. Anne, St. Maron, St. Gregory of Nyssa and others; the Church of St. John the Warrior remained the only functioning church in Yakimanka. St. Joachim and St. Anne was torn down in 1933.Russian: Official 1922 documents at mir.voskres.ru However, compared to other districts, the Joseph Stalin era brought very little damage to Yakimanka; the area seemed to be neglected. In the 1920s, the old Wine and Salt Court in Bersenevka was replaced by the House on Embankment; further south, Moscow's first cooperative apartment building was completed in 1926. Gorky Park development began in 1923 with the first All-Russian Agricultural Exhibition; in 1928, the fairgrounds were reopened as a public park. The existing Stalin- style entrance arch was added later, in 1950s. The 1935 Moscow Master Plan called for completing the Boulevard Ring through Zamoskvorechye, which was not done. The only trace of this project is the 1937 Writers' Apartments building facing the Tretyakov building (expanded in the 1950s and 2000s); it housed elite writers like Yevgeny Petrov of Ilf and Petrov fame, Boris Pasternak, and Konstantin Paustovsky.\\"–ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ—É–ª–∫–æ–≤\\", –ú, 1997 Similar grand Stalinist buildings were planned all along the new route, but were cancelled. The most important outcome of Stalin's projects came with completion of the 1932‚Äì1938 Moscow Canal: floods were no longer a threat for the Yakimanka lowlands. River banks that formerly shifted every season were firmly set in granite; all downtown Moscow river and Vodootvodny Canal bridges were rebuilt to six- to eight-lane capacity. Major destruction of Yakimanka took place in Leonid Brezhnev's time. The western side of Bolshaya Yakimanka was rebuilt in the high-rise style typical of the time. Similar structures appeared in Polyanka Street, both as infills and as block-wide projects. This was followed by facadist \\"reconstruction\\" of the 1990s-2000s and new high-rises like the 15-story Copernicus building.

It became operational in 1891 and was built by Westinghouse Electric around two of their large alternators. One was set up in the valley as a generator and driven by water. It was connected by a transmission line to the second alternator used as a motor up at the Gold King Mine to drive the mining operation. The facility has been changed and upgraded over the years but is still in operation. It is now on the List of IEEE Milestones. History The need to power a stamp mill to process ore at the Gold King Mine up in the mountains near Ophir, Colorado drove major stock holder Lucien L. Nunn to seek a less expensive alternative to the wood powered steam mill at the site. Timber fuel was in scarce supply at the mines 12,000 foot height and coal could not be used because there was no railroad leading to the mine. The San Miguel River 3000 feet down the slope 3 miles from the mine looked to be a good power source but some of the methods of transmitting the power including water powered compressed air and belt drives did not seem feasible. Lucien's brother Paul, an electrical engineer, began looking into using electric motors to drive the plant. A 220 volt direct current electric system was found to be too expensive due to the size of the copper conductors needed to transmit such a low voltage the distances they were contemplating. A high voltage alternating current system looked more promising so they contacted Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Westinghouse Electric in 1890 and convinced them to supply an electricity driven system based on alternating current technology.Alan E. Drew, Telluride Power Co.Pioneering ac in the Rocky Mountains, http://magazine.ieee-pes.org Workmen with one of the two Westinghouse alternators used in the original 1891 Ames Hydroelectric AC power installation The AC system was engineered and installed by Westinghouse employees V.G. Converse, Lewis B. Stillwell, Charles F. Scott, and Ralph D. Mershon with the assistance of engineering students they recruited from Cornell University.Michelle Malkin, Who Built That: Awe-Inspiring Stories of American Tinkerpreneurs, Simon and Schuster - 2016, page 205 In the summer of 1890 Westinghouse delivered the equipment and the engineers installed it later that winter. The system consisted of two identical 100-hp Westinghouse single- phase alternators (the largest the company made at the time). One was set up in a generator house, initially just a wooden shed, in the small settlement of Ames where the Howard Fork and Lake Fork streams joined to form the San Miguel River, just outside Ophir. Used as a generator, it produced 3000 volt, 133 Hertz, single-phase AC. It was driven by a six-foot Pelton wheel under a head of water carried in a 2 ft diameter steel pipe supplied by the Howard Fork and Lake Fork as well as natural reservoirs up hill from the plant. Ames Hydro: Making History Since 1891 HydroWorld, 08/27/2013 The electricity was transmitted up the mountain to the mine via two bare copper wires mounted on poles using Western Union cross-arms with insulators. Total wire costs were about US $700, about 1% of the cost estimated for a direct-current line. At the mine the second 100-hp Westinghouse alternator was installed in the role of a synchronous AC motor to drive the stamping mill. A smaller single-phase induction motor (a new type of motor developed from patents Westinghouse had licensed from inventor Nikola Tesla) was installed as a starter motor to spin the larger alternator up to match the synchronous speed of the generator. Interior view, 1895 Ames powerhouse The power system became operational on 19 June 1891 and was run continuously for the first 30 days. The entire plant required 15 to 20 attendants for its operation. The instruments and controls were rudimentary, solenoid type gravity balance Voltmeters and ammeters mounted on lacquered wooden boards. Workers had to take special care because of the high voltages used. Power was connected by closing simple knife switches and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit \\"opened\\") by a worker grabbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style plug mounted on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs).Alan E. Drew, Telluride Power Co.Pioneering ac in the Rocky Mountains, http://magazine.ieee- pes.org One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location. The alternators were set on paraffin-soaked oak platforms to add insulation and Westinghouse engineers tried various types of lightning arrestors. The alternators were designed with removable parts making the task of repairing them a little easier. With the success of the plant the Nunns started installing similar systems at their other mining operations. In 1896 the Ames plant was rebuilt with a new three- phase system with new generators and induction motors along with step-up transformers to boost the power to 10,000 volts for longer distance transmission. The water supply was also expanded. The Ames plant became part of the Nunn‚Äôs Telluride Power Company which would later become part of Western Colorado Power Company, formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Utah Power and Light. Public Service Company acquired the plant with other Colorado Ute properties in 1992. A 1905 vintage power house is still in service for Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, with two Pelton wheels powering a single 1904 General Electric generator, with output of 2,400 volts, and 1,082 amperes at a speed of 225 R.P.M.  Significance in the history of the electrical energy supply  Overall view of Ames plant, early 20th century The Ames power station was built at the end of a decade that saw the rapid expansion in the use of alternating current as a power transmission format. During this period Westinghouse was in stiff competition with other AC companies as well with Thomas Edison's direct current based Edison Electric Company. A propaganda campaign/\\"war of currents\\" had even broken out between Westinghouse and Edison. Westinghouse Electric looked on the Ames project as a great way to demonstrate the capability of the AC system they had been developing since they installed their first AC transformer based lighting systems in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in March 1886. 2010 exterior view of Ames Power Station, built 1905. The 1891 Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant is considered to be the oldest hydro-power plant to produce and transmit alternating current for an industrial purposes. It was predated by the Oregon- based Willamette Falls Electric Company, the first US AC hydro-electric generation facility, in 1889, which included a 14-mile-long (23-kilometre) transmission line to Portland, used to power arc lighting. The oldest hydroelectric power plant supplying a commercial transmission system for alternating current was the power plant Thorenberg near Lucerne in Switzerland. The plant started operation in May 1886 and fed 1,800 volts to a nearly transmission line. It was transformed to 100 volts to illuminate some hotels and restaurants in the downtown area of the city. The original Ames/Gold King plant is also notable for the small starter motor used, an early use of an induction motor, a new efficient commutator-less design that would later become common place. The patent for the motor had been licensed by Westinghouse from Nikola Tesla two years earlier and was being developed by Charles F. Scott, but engineering problems and the general shortage of cash the company was going through was holding back development.Quentin R.

Casely-Hayford was committed to public service and worked to improve the conditions of black men and women. As a pioneer of women's education in Sierra Leone, she played a key role in popularizing Pan-Africanist and feminist politics during the early nineteen hundreds. She established a school for girls in 1923 called Girl's Vocational and Training School in Freetown, to instill cultural and racial pride during the colonial years under British rule. Promoting the preservation of Sierra Leone national identity and cultural heritage, in 1925 she wore a traditional African costume to attend a reception in honor of the Prince of Wales, where she created a sensation. Early life and education Adelaide Smith was born on 2 June 1868 to an elite family in Freetown, British Sierra Leone, to a mixed-race father (William Smith Jr, of English and royal Fanti parentage) from the Gold Coast and a Creole mother, Anne Spilsbury, of English, Jamaican Maroon, and Sierra Leone Liberated African ancestry.Rogers, Brittany Rose, \\"Hayford, Adelaide Smith Casely (1868‚Äì1960)\\", BlackPast.org. Adelaide was the second youngest of her parents' seven children. She and her sisters grew up mostly in England, where her father had retired in 1872 with his family on a pension of 666 pounds sterling. She attended Jersey Ladies' College (now Jersey College for Girls). Like many other Sierra Leonean women born into the elite society, she was deeply influenced by Victorian values and ideas of family and gender roles. Casely-Hayford also traveled, and it was during these travels that she became interested in Pan Africanist politics. In 1872, she migrated to London and studied at the Ladies College on the island of Jersey. At the age of 17, Smith went to Stuttgart, Germany, to study music at the Stuttgart Conservatory. She returned to England where, together with a sister, she opened a boarding home for African bachelors who were living in the country as students or workers.\\"Adelaide Casely Hayford (1868‚Äì1960), Cultural Nationalist and Educationist\\", The Sierra Leone Web. In 1905, during one of her speeches, she emphasized the important role that African women could play in social and political development. Two years later, she returned to the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Marriage and family While in England, Adelaide Smith married J. E. Casely Hayford (also known as Ekra-Agiman). Their marriage may have given her a deeper insight into African culture and influenced her transformation into a cultural nationalist. Their daughter Gladys Casely- Hayford became a well-known Creole poet.\\"Gladys May Casely-Hayford ('Acquah Laluah')\\", in Margaret Busby (ed.), Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, biographical note, pp. 217‚Äì18. In 1914, Adelaide and J.E.'s marriage failed. After that, she returned to Sierra Leone. Return to Freetown After 25 years abroad, Adelaide Casely-Hayford and her sisters returned to Sierra Leone. Inspired by the ideas of racial pride and co- operation advanced by Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), she joined the Ladies Division of the Freetown Branch. She became a leading African feminist, using her speeches and writing to challenge male supremacy in Africa and to support African women's rights. In 1915, she delivered a speech on \\"The rights of women and Christian Marriage\\" articulating her vision for increasing women's rights. She rose to be President of the UNIA. In June 1920, she resigned from the association because of a conflict of interest between it and her proposed Girls' Vocational School. She toured the United States, giving public lectures to correct American notions about Africa. Back in Freetown, Casely-Hayford embarked on establishing a vocational institution to help girls learn their cultural background and instill national pride. In October 1923, the Girls' Vocational School opened in the Smith family home with 14 pupils. As principal, Casely- Hayford would have preferred the pupils to wear native dress to school, but their parents rejected this idea. The Girl's Vocational School was very unique because there were not many educational opportunities for girls in Sierra Leone at the time. The school was also unique because it not only taught young girls African history, but it also taught them how to be independent thinkers and economically independent. She wanted to instill girls with the confidence and skills to become future leaders in Africa and Sierra Leone. In a 1922 editorial, she said \\"Instantly, my eyes were opened to the fact that the education meted out to [African People] had ... taught us to despise ourselves... Our immediate need was an education which would instill to us a love of country, pride of race, an enthusiasm for the black man's capabilities, and a genuine admiration for Africa's wonderful art work,\\" and that she \\"was looking forward ... to a new day, in which African shall be allowed to expand and develop, along with her own ideas and ideals.\\" She spent her later years writing her memoirs and short stories. Her short story \\"Mista Courifer\\" was featured in Langston Hughes' African Treasury: Articles, Essays, Stories, Poems (1960), a collection of short works by African writers, published in the United States. She died in Freetown on 24 January 1960, aged 91. Importance in today‚Äôs society Adelaide Smith Casely Hayford paved the way for young girls in her home country to be able to go to school and learn skills that they otherwise might not have been able to learn on their own. Adelaide gave women the right to learn and to speak for themselves but to also persuade mothers to raise their children in their home country so that they could be immersed in the culture that they were born into. Legacy and honors Casely-Hayford opposed the injustices of the colonial system and advocated cultural nationalism, earning the respect of British authorities. * 1935, she was awarded the King's Silver Jubilee Medal. * 1949, she received the MBE. Asteroid 6848 Casely-Hayford, discovered by American astronomers Eleanor Helin and Schelte Bus at Palomar Observatory in 1978, was named in her memory.

It is 3 km away from the center of Sivasagar Town. Situated by the side of the Assam Trunk Road, it lies to the northeast of the Rangpur Palace, a seven-storied royal complex comprising the Talatal Ghar and the Kareng Ghar. History Said to be one of the oldest surviving amphitheaters in Asia, the building was first constructed during the reign of Swargadeo Rudra Singha with bamboo and wood. It was later rebuilt with brick by Swargadeo Pramatta Singha in AD 1744-1750. Architecture The roof of the Rang Ghar is shaped like an inverted royal Ahom long boat. The base of the monument has a series of arched entrances, while atop the roof sits a decorative pair of carved stone crocodiles. Many of the arched entrances have retained little more than their brick framework, with mere vestiges of sculptural adornments here and there. The Ahoms, who used special, thin, baked bricks, did not use cement but a paste of rice and eggs as mortar for their construction, a pulses called Maati Maah and a fish named Borali Mach in Assamese. They also made use of powdered mixed lime and bricks to cover the surface of the inner walls. It is said that this layer of powder used to keep the inside of the Rang Ghar cool. The adjoining field, known as Rupohi Pothar, wore a festive look when games like bull-fight, cock-fight, elephant fight, wrestling, etc., were held on different occasions during the Ahom rule. Rang Ghar, besides standing as the royal pavilion, also contributed in spreading the games to different parts of the kingdom and its neighbouring States. About a kilometer to the northeast of the Rang Ghar is the Joysagar Pukhuri. This is a man-made tank, encompassing an area of about 120 bighas of land. It was dug in memory of Joymoti Konwari, mother of Rudra Singha - the most illustrious of the Ahom kings.

The company specializes in a variety of chicken and turkey (bird) products advertised as fresh and naturally locally grown.Foster Poultry Farms Source: International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 32. St. James Press, 2000 quoted by FundingUniverse.com. History =Beginnings= Foster Farms was established in 1939 by Max and Verda Foster. They began by investing $1,000 into a farm in Modesto, California, on which they raised turkeys. The back porch was Max's office and the first hatchery was built next to their bedroom so the eggs could get constant care.FosterFarms.com. 2007. October 26, 2008. \\"About Us: History\\" at Fosterfarms.com In 1942, Max quit his day job as a reporter and city editor for the Modesto Bee. Around this time, the Fosters expanded into raising cattle and chickens. As the business grew, the Fosters acquired another farm and a feed mill in the 1950s. The feed mill allowed the company some independence from outside feed contracts. In 1959, Foster Farms acquired the Sunland Poultrypersonal knowledge of Gary L. Wiseman processing plant in Livingston, California, and in 1960, the company's headquarters was moved there from Modesto. Livestock were slaughtered, processed, and packaged at the Livingston plant on an assembly line. =1970s= In 1969, Max and Verda Foster turned the company over to their son Paul Foster who became President of Foster Farms. In 1973, Foster Farms opened a major distribution center to serve southern California in El Monte, California. In 1977, Paul died of a sudden heart attack, and his brother Thomas became president of the company. =1980s= In 1982, the company bought the property of The Grange Company and its branch, Valchris Poultry.Lindblom, Mike. \\"Small Towns Like Its Huge Chicken Plant.\\" Daily News. September 2, 1996: A1. After this purchase the company re-entered the turkey business and began to produce deli products under the Foster Farms name. By the 1980s, Foster Farms had many new products to offer, such as bologna, poultry franks and luncheon meats.Smith, Timothy. \\"Changing Tastes: By End of This Year Poultry Will Surpass Beef in The U.S. Diet.\\" Wall Street Journal. September 17, 1987:1 Sales tripled between 1975 and 1988; by 1987, Foster Farms was selling about 140 million chickens per year, making it the largest chicken producer in California. The company's hens laid around 2.2 million eggs per week, which were then transported to hatcheries and kept in an incubator for 18 days. When the chicks hatched, they were taken to different ranches for about 52 days, while they ate the company's own corn and soybean meals. A day-old chick Throughout the 1980s, Foster Farms began to make commercials, with one winning a Clio Award in 1988. By the mid-1980s, their sales had continued to improve, and they expanded again, purchasing Oregon's largest poultry producer, Fircrest Farms in Creswell, in 1987. In 1988, the company leadership decided to increase production capacity. They created a new fryer ranch with one million square feet of poultry housing in Merced, California, upgraded their feed mill in Ceres, California, and built a new distribution facility and sales office for Northern California in Livingston. In November 1989, Foster Farms obtained a turkey processing plant in Fresno, California, from Roxford Foods. The turkey processing plant was converted into a chicken processing plant; new equipment was added that enabled the plant to process 80 million more chickens a year. With the discovery that saturated fat intake was linked to heart disease, Americans began to eat less red meat and more chicken. This change dramatically increased sales for Foster Farms. Sales began to drop in 1987, after a report broadcast on the television newsmagazine show 60 Minutes claimed that a high percentage of chicken was infected with salmonella.Tyson, Rae. \\"Beef Industry Hits Hard Times.\\" USA Today.

The Foster brothers remained on the company's board. Sales began to expand once again and so did the company, purchasing Lynden Farms for approximately $8.2 million in 1994. By 1996 annual sales totaled around $900 million. The company had become the largest poultry producer on the entire West Coast and the eighth largest in the nation. In 1997, the company bought the leading poultry producer in Washington, Pederson's Fryer Farms, for approximately $7 million. The company opened a $45 million, 500-job processing facility in South Kelso, Washington in 1998. It also acquired the Butterball Turkey Company's turkey processing plant and feed mill in Turlock, California, along with a hatchery in Fresno, California, and purchased Griffith Foods, an Alabama producer of corn dogs. In 1999 Tom Foster died; George Foster remained active in the company. That same year Foster Farms produced over 750 million pounds of poultry and was the second-largest corn dog producer in the United States. =2000s= In October 2001, Foster Farms acquired the chicken operations of Southern California's Zacky Farms. This addition included Zacky Farms' Fresno plant, hatchery, feed mill, and live productions ranches, as well as its Los Angeles distribution center.

During this process, the workers decertified the UFCW, formed the new union, struggled with Foster Farms to gain recognition of the new union. In October 2005, there was a brief strike.\\"Foster Farms poultry workers go on strike\\". Los Angeles Times. October 26, 2005. On June 25, 2018, a truck carrying 5000 chickens crashed in Clark County, WA, killing many of the birds. The truck was en route to Foster Farm's processing plant in Kelso, WA. Animal activists attempted to negotiate with Foster Farms to let them take some of the chickens to animal sanctuaries. Foster Farms refused, citing health risks. One activist was arrested for refusing to release a chicken. The following night a vigil was held to honor the suffering of chickens at Foster Farms and elsewhere. Salmonella outbreak On October 7, 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a public health alert for raw chicken packaged at three Foster Farms facilities in California as an estimated 278 people had fallen ill in the past six months. Strains of multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg are associated with chicken distributed to retail outlets in California, Oregon and Washington state. The outbreak spread to 18 states, though most of the reported illnesses were in California. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service did not mandate a recall of chicken from those facilities, lacking the authority to do so. It deemed the company's poultry safe to eat as long as it is cooked to a minimum of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. The USDA agreed to let affected poultry plants remain open after the company agreed to fix problems. In mid-June 2014, Foster Farms executives announced that via stringent measures the company had cut Salmonella contamination in its raw cut-up chicken to about 2%, well below the national industry average of 25%. They reiterated standard food safety advice to handle raw poultry safely and cook it to at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.Aleccia, Jonel. \\"Amid Outbreak, Foster Farms Steps Up Food Safety\\". NBC News. June 16, 2014.Marcum, Diana. \\"Foster Farms says salmonella rates have fallen significantly\\". Los Angeles Times. June 16, 2014. A PBS Frontline report broadcast in May 2015 was rather critical of Foster Farms and drew attention to deficient food safety regulation. Shortly after the report was broadcast, Frontline received a letter from a lawyer representing Foster Farms which previously declined all Frontline requests to present their case for the report. The letter disputed the reported finding by the Oregon Public Health Division that one person had died in a 2004 Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak that the state linked to Foster Farms. Frontline invited Foster Farms once again to discuss their position with them, but they would not do so. COVID-19 pandemic By April 20, 2020, four workers were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a Foster Farms plant in Kelso, Washington. Health officials in Cowlitz County, Washington, described the cases as a \\"cluster\\". On April 22, Foster Farms reported that an employee at one of its two plants in Fresno, California, had tested positive for coronavirus. Those two plants employ about 3,000 workers. On August 13, Gurpal Samra, the mayor of Livingston, California, announced that Merced County officials had informed him that 217 workers at the local Foster Farms chicken processing plant had COVID-19, and that two workers had died. According to Samra, \\"There are no guidelines, no books, no manuals, on how to deal with this anywhere at the state level. Even the federal government is in disarray. So Merced County Health, who‚Äôs never had to deal with this either, is trying to find the best way to work with it.\\" On August 18, the Merced County Public Health Department confirmed that over 300 workers were infected and that seven workers had died. The plant employs over 3,700 people. On August 26, the Merced County Health Department ordered the plant in Livingston closed. By that time, 358 workers were confirmed to have the coronavirus, and eight had died. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra stated \\"Foster Farms‚Äô poultry operation in Livingston, California, has experienced an alarming spread of COVID-19 among its workers. Nobody can ignore the facts: It‚Äôs time to hit the reset button on Foster Farms‚Äô Livingston plant.\\" The following day, the California Department of Public Health released a letter stating that Foster Farms has a \\"legal obligation to comply with public health orders and guidance, as well as an obligation to its workers and to the people of Merced County and surrounding counties and that these obligations compel Foster Farms to immediately comply with the order issued yesterday by the County\\". The agency reported that \\"other Foster Farms facilities in multiple counties also are experiencing outbreaks\\". Finances and industry statistics Also in 2005, Foster Farms was awarded California's highest environmental honor, the Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award (GEELA), from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\"Governor Schwarzenegger Names Recipients of State's Top Environmental Leadership Awards\\". SFenvironment.org. November 22, 2005.\\"Approval of a Commendation for the 75th Anniversary of the Foster Farms Company\\". The Board of Supervisors of the County of Stanislaus. May 20, 2014. The GEELA program recognizes exceptional leadership and notable contributions in conserving California's resources and recognizes the significance of a joint project between Foster Farms and the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). The company received the 2005 POWER Award from Public Officials for Water and Environmental Reform.\\"Businesses get environmental awards\\" . Central Valley Business Times. November 23, 2005. The annual POWER Award honors companies that provide solutions to the state's water issues and serve as models to others in this regard. Foster Farms is one of the biggest West Coast poultry producers. The revenue increase has been accompanied by a decrease in manpower. As of December 2007, the company's revenues stood at approximately $2.00 billion, an 11.1% change in revenue from the previous year. At the same time, the company was estimated to employ approximately 10,500 people.\\"America‚Äôs Largest Private Companies: Foster Farms\\". Archived copy Forbes. November 3, 2008.

The springs formerly at the site have ceased flowing, Geography Cartersburg Springs (Magnetic Springs) is located at . History The springs were known by and used extensively by Native Americans in the area well before the first white settler, Samuel McCormick and his wife arrived about 1800. Native American artifacts such as arrowheads, and beads, were periodically found near the springs as recently as the 1950s. Samuel and his wife settled on the hill overlooking the springs near what is now Cartersburg, Indiana, and raised 12 children. According to a 1926 recorded interview with daughter Eliza Jane McCormick, no one in the family ever required the care of a doctor. The family attributed their good health to the healing powers of the spring water. By the mid-19th century residents of the area would regularly visit the springs to bathe and take home containers of this miracle water. In 1822, George Matlock, Jacob Wagoner, William Ballard, and Alen Little purchased the farm that surrounded the springs. By the late 19th century the springs had become so popular for picnics and social gatherings that A.W. Carter, G.V. Seaton, J.A. Veatch, John Tartelon, Edward Conn, T.A. Prewitt, and J.A. Dobyn formed the Cartersburg Springs Mineral Corporation with the intent of selling shares and building a resort. A post in the Danville Union newspaper dated Feb. 19, 1874 states: Almost immediately disagreements and disputes erupted, some leading to bitter grudges. By 1900, the group had spent a tidy sum of money that they didn't have, and they were forced to sell some of the land. One of the stockholders, Albert Veatch, purchased about including the hill overlooking the springs with the intent of building a competing hotel but that dream never materialized. An advertisement titled \\"The Season of 1901\\" promoted the springs by saying, Brochure prices were: * Weekly board $7.00/$8.00 * Daily board $1.50 * Single meals $0.40 * Bath with attendant $0.50 Around 1903 the balance of the Cartersburg Springs Mineral Corporation was purchased by Dr. Kimberlin, a well-known heart specialist. He immediately sold a 49% interest to Armand Koehne and together they pushed the enterprise into a summer hotel success. A 1903 water analysis report released by the Indiana State Board of Health and signed by the boards director Dr. J.N. Hurty says: By the summer of 1904, with Lee Allison as the hotel proprietor, wealthy people began sending their children, nannies, and nurse-maids to the hotel for the entire summer with the parents joining them on weekends. Every room of the hotel was filled from June through August, and in 1905 and again in 1906, advanced reservations ensured that every room would be occupied the following summer. Besides the springs, there was a dance hall, bowling alley, race track, and picnic grounds in and around the resort. The hotel was doing quite well and the area was thriving. After the hotel closed for the season in 1906, Mr. Allison moved his belongings to a hill house and began making plans for new additions to be built and available by next season. In the middle of a beautiful fall night fire broke out at the rear of the hotel and spread via a board walk to the bath house. People from all around arrived in an attempt to save the structures, but all was a total loss. Neither the hotel or bath house were rebuilt, some say because the two partners couldn't agree on what type of new facility should be built. Rumor is that Dr. Kimberlin wanted it to be a clean, wholesome, Christian place, while Mr. Koehne preferred a more \\"free and easy\\" life style. Rumors also suggested that the hotel's insurance premium was due the next day and that a container of oil soaked rags were found near what was thought to be the fires source - however arson was never proven. Cartersburg Crystal Spring Water bottle Despite the demise of the resort, the springs eventually returned as a source of income for Cartersburg-Crystal Springs Inc. as a source of its bottled water. A collection plant was built at the springs and water was trucked to Indianapolis for processing and bottling. Cartersburg-Crystal Spring water was available at many of Indianapolis's finest hotels and restaurants as well as for home delivery. Cartersburg-Crystal Springs Inc. was located at 955 Fort Wayne Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana for over 50 years. The springs, which once produced more than per day, have since stopped flowing. The collection plant at the springs has been incorporated into a residence, but the original structure remains visible to this day.

As is the case with many of her novels, there is a strong focus on nanotechnology and genetic engineering. Also typical of her works, government and corporate corruption plays a large role in the story, in this case as antagonistic suppressors of generally positive and liberating transhumanizing technology. Limit of Vision tells the story of a rogue colony of artificial, independently viable neural cells called asterids (nicknamed LOVs, because their size is at the limit of human vision) which escapes from containment aboard a corporate research lab in low Earth orbit. Plummeting to Earth, the colony's habitat lands off the coast of Vietnam, to be picked up by Ela Suvanatat, a freelance journalist. Ela is helped by a group of young children living under the protection of a ROSA (ROving Silicon Agent, a nearly sentient computer program) named Mother Tiger, who see an opportunity to advance their lots in life by cooperating with the LOVs in a form of symbiosis. Events quickly spiral out of control as the corporate lab, Equasys, joins with the UN to eradicate the LOVs.  Plot summary  Virgil Copeland and Randall Panwar are forced to give a project review to the senior staff of Equatorial Systems alone when their fellow scientist Gabrielle Villanti fails to show up. Panwar stumbles through the presentation, showcasing their life work: asterids (artificial neurons) known as LOVs. Although LOVs showed promise in initial experiments, the enhanced intelligence of the test animals was offset by the uncontrolled growth of the LOVs, which eventually killed their hosts. LOVs were therefore made dependent on two amino acids: nopaline for metabolism and octopine for reproduction. In the second phase of the experiment, the LOVs were encased in silicate shells. These LOVs were able to safely interact with the test animals. Unfortunately, an unrelated incident at a rival biotechnology company prompted a government crackdown, and the LOVs were exported to the Hammer, a space station in low Earth orbit. Panwar's presentation is cut short when security interrupt with news of an incident at the lab. Gabrielle, Panwar, and Virgil had illegally implanted LOV clusters on their foreheads in order to communicate with the LOV colonies in their care, and Gabrielle had apparently entered a fugue state and died of exhaustion while in communion with their latest experimental subject. Their administrators learn of this shortly when they discover Virgil attempting to surreptitiously remove the LOVs from Gabrielle's corpse, and the two surviving scientists are put into quarantine. Unfortunately, the LOV colony is quite a bit more intelligent and resourceful than anyone had anticipated; it has overcome several obstacles and colonized key areas of the Hammer. When it learns what has happened, it takes control of several drones and severs the lab module from the space station. Ela Suvanatat is a freelance journalist doing a story on the plight of fishing villages in Vietnam when the Equasys lab module crashes offshore. Although it is quickly declared off limits by the government, Ela hires a boat and makes her way out to the crash site. She is barely able to scoop up a few stray LOVs which have survived atmospheric reentry and get back to shore before the military arrives and cordons off the site. Racing through the marsh ahead of military patrols, Ela comes into contact with the Roi Nuoc, a group of children under the care of a nearly sentient computer program named Mother Tiger. The Roi Nuoc take her to one of their benefactors, a businessman named Ky Xuan Nguyen. While cleaning up at his house, Ela discovers that the packet of LOVs has torn and most of her find is missing, but there are a few LOVs lodged in her forehead. Meanwhile, Virgil and Panwar attempt escape from quarantine, but Panwar is gunned down and Virgil barely makes it to Panwar's one-man automated submarine. Virgil shortly receives from a message from Ela, who is worried that her LOVs seem to be dying. He tells her that crown galls on some plants might contain nopaline, and orders her a supply of both nopaline and octopine tablets from a chemical supply company. Ela is forced to flee her safe house when the military begins a house-to-house search, but she stops along the way to gather crown galls and then asks one of the Roi Nuoc to lead her back to the pool in which she took shelter after swimming ashore. At the pool, Ela plunges half of her crown galls into the mud, hoping to save any LOVs which had made their way into the water.

Equipment Electron beam therapy is performed using a medical linear accelerator. The same device can also be used to produce high energy photon beams. When electrons are required, the x-ray target is retracted out of the beam and the electron beam is collimated with a piece of apparatus known as an applicator or an additional collimating insert, constructed from a low melting point alloy. Properties Note the rapid falloff for 4 MeV electron compared to X rays and Protons. Electron beams have a finite range, after which dose falls off rapidly. Therefore, they spare deeper healthy tissue. The depth of the treatment is selected by the appropriate energy. Unlike photon beams there is no surface sparing effect, so electron therapy is used when the target extends to the patient's skin. Indications Electron beam therapy is used in the treatment of superficial tumors like cancer of skin regions, or total skin (e.g. mycosis fungoides), diseases of the limbs (e.g. melanoma and lymphoma), nodal irradiation, and it may also be used to boost the radiation dose to the surgical bed after mastectomy or lumpectomy. For deeper regions intraoperative electron radiation therapy might be applied.

Telecommunications wiring is most commonly configured using the twisted pair technique, and a split pair can cause problems like crosstalk on a phone line or interference with a video signal. These problems can indicate a wiring issue and may prompt a technician to check for signs that pairs could have been split while connecting telecommunications interfaces. Such wiring negates the benefit of using a twisted pair in the first place and is likely to cause errors in high rate data lines and increase interference on voice lines, especially on long lengths of cable. When using registered jack connections and other connection schemes that use modular connectors, it's very easy for someone to get a split pair error. The easiest way to wire such a connector is to put the pairs next to each other, but this will not result in correct pairing.

Career Alan Weiss began his professional comics career at Warren Publishing by drawing the story \\"Gunsmoke Charly!\\" in Creepy #35 (Sept. 1970). The following year, he began working for Marvel Comics as well where he drew The Avengers, Captain America, Daredevil, Sub-Mariner, and The Amazing Spider- Man. Weiss recalled in a 2006 interview there was a \\"lost\\" Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the Jonathan Swift novel Gulliver's Travels. Portions of it were printed in the second volume of Marvel Masterworks: Warlock. The remainder of the artwork was lost in a New York City taxicab in 1976. In 1977, Weiss was one of the artists on the first issue of Marvel Comics Super Special which featured the rock band Kiss in a 40-page fictional adventure written by Steve Gerber. Kiss reappeared in an occult adventure in issue #5 (1978) which was written by Weiss. In April 1978, Weiss and writer E. Nelson Bridwell revamped the Captain Marvel character for DC with Weiss providing more realistic art for the series. Dennis O'Neil and Weiss created the character Calypso in The Amazing Spider-Man #209 (Oct. 1980). Weiss created the Steelgrip Starkey and the All-Purpose Power Tool limited series for Marvel Comics' Epic Comics comics line in 1986 and War Dancer for Defiant Comics in 1994. Weiss has worked on DC Comics' alternate universe series Elseworlds, co-writing and pencilling the Batman graphic novel The Blue, the Grey and the Bat as well as Paradox Press' The Big Book Of series, doing many pages on a variety of historical topics. From 2002 to 2005, he contributed work to Tom Strong's Terrific Tales published by America's Best Comics. His work has appeared in the comic books The Human Drama, Big Apple Comix, The Twilight Zone, Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery, and Our Love Story; in Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror comics magazines Creepy and Eerie; and the satirical magazines National Lampoon and Blast. Inker Joe Rubinstein called Weiss \\"the most difficult guy in the business to ink, without exception.\\" He added that this also made him one of his favorite artists to ink, because Weiss's work was so intricate that he couldn't tell what the final art would look like until he had finished inking it.

Part of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's 1857 Greensward Plan for Central Park, the features are located on the west side of the park between the 66th and 79th Street transverses. The Ramble, located on the north shore of the Lake, is a forested area with highly varied topography and numerous winding walks, designated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a protected nature preserve. It was designed as a \\"wild garden\\" away from carriage drives and bridle paths, in which to be wandered, or to be viewed as a \\"natural\\" landscape. The Ramble includes several rustic bridges, and formerly contained a small cave. Historically, it has been frequented for both birdwatching and cruising. The serpentine Lake offers dense naturalistic planting, rocky outcrops of glacially scarred Manhattan bedrock, small open glades, and an artificial stream (the Gill) that empties through the Azalea Pond, then down a cascade into the Lake. At the northwestern corner of the Lake, the ground rises toward Vista Rock, crowned by a lookout and folly named Belvedere Castle. The western shore includes the Ladies' Shelter, the southern shore contains a waterfront porch called Bethesda Terrace, and the eastern shore contains the Loeb Boathouse. Geography = Ramble = The Ramble is one of three main woodlands in Central Park, the others being North Woods and Hallett Nature Sanctuary. The Ramble covers , and contains a series of winding paths, as well as outcrops, rustic structures, and several bridges. The Ramble is designated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a \\"Forever Wild\\" natural preserve, which prevents any future redevelopment of the site. During construction, the park's most varied and intricately planted landscape was planted with native trees such as tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica); American sycamore; white, red, black, scarlet, and willow oaks; Hackberry; and Liriodendron. These trees were arranged to create a colorful tropical effect. These coexisted with some American trees never native to the area, such as Kentucky coffee tree, yellowwood, and cucumber magnolia, and a few exotics, such as Phellodendron and Sophora. Smaller natives include sassafras. Aggressively self-seeding black cherry and black locust later came to dominate the Ramble. A 1979 census of the Ramble's trees, taken by Bruce Kelly, Philip Winslow, and James Marston Fitch, found 6,000 trees, including 60 specimen trees of landscape value. = Lake and watercourses = The Lake, covering , unified what Calvert Vaux called the \\"irregular disconnected featureless conglomeration of ground\\".Quoted in It was excavated, entirely by hand, from unprepossessing swampy ground transected by drainage ditches and ramshackle stone walls. The Lake is connected to two additional watercourses. The Gill, adapted from the Scottish word for \\"stream\\", starts from a water pipe in the middle of the Ramble and flows southeast into Azalea Pond, a collecting pond adjacent to the Lake frequented by birdwatchers. In addition, an inlet called Bank Rock Bay extends off the extreme north end of the Lake. The Ladies' Skating Pond once abutted the western side of the Lake. It was partially infilled due to malaria concerns in 1888, and it was completely drained by 1936. Today, the site of the Ladies' Pond is occupied by a lawn and dog walk that is much lower than the surrounding topography. Notable features = Bethesda Terrace and Fountain = From left Bethesda Terrace and Fountain are located at the southeastern end of the Lake. They form the northern end of the Central Park Mall, the only formal feature in the park's original blueprint, the Greensward Plan. The terrace is composed of two levels, the lower of which houses the fountain. The center of the fountain contains the sculpture Angel of the Waters (1873) by Emma Stebbins, the first large public sculpture commission for an American woman. =Bridges= There are multiple bridges in the Ramble, including one across the Lake. Bow Bridge connects the Lake's southern shore with the Ramble, on the northern shore of the Lake. The span is notable for its intricate cast iron design. Its span is the longest of any bridge in the park, though the balustrade is long. Bow Bridge was restored in 1974. The northern end of the Lake is spanned by a small bridge called Oak Bridge or Cabinet Bridge. It crosses Bank Rock Bay and for this reason is also called Bank Rock Bridge. The original structure was a wooden trestle made of yellow pine upon stone abutments. After a period of decline, the bridge was completely replaced in 1935, and again in 1982 and 2009. The abutments are the only holdovers from the original span. The railings of the current span are made of cast-iron panels between wooden posts. There are also three smaller spans in the Ramble. One of them, the Ramble Arch, is a stone arch that carries one pedestrian walkway over another, and is made of rockface ashlar. Additionally, the Gill Bridge, a wooden bridge, crosses the Gill at its mouth. Another wooden bridge, unnamed, is located further upstream of the Gill. = Cave = A cave was originally located inside the Ramble, adjacent to Ramble Arch. It was not originally part of the Greensward Plan, but rather, was originally a narrow cavity uncovered after a deposit of fertile soil was excavated at the site. Olmsted and Vaux lined the entrance of the cavity with boulders and created a stone staircase down to the Cave. The Ramble Cave, also known as Indian Cave, was a popular attraction. It was characterized as a romantic spot and as a play area for kids. A teenage runaway may have lived in the Cave for a month in the late 1890s. However, by the early 20th century, the Cave had become associated with crime. For instance, a suicide in the Cave occurred in 1904, and an alleged attempted robbery occurred in 1922. The largest of these crimes occurred in 1929 when 335 men, some of whom were found in the Cave, were arrested for \\"annoying women\\" . By 1934, it was sealed off because of numerous reports of suicides, crimes, and homeless people. =Hernshead and Ladies' Pavilion= Ladies' Pavilion The western shore of the Lake, between 75th and 77th Streets, contains a rocky promontory that Olmsted called the Hernshead. Translated to \\"heron's head\\", it is named because the outcrop is shaped roughly like a heron's head. The outcrop was restored in 1987. The Ladies Cottage was once located at the Hernshead. It was so named because it abutted the Ladies' Skating Pond, and might have been used as a gender-separated locker room for female skaters as early as 1860. The Ladies' Pavilion, a wrought iron shelter in a playful Gothic style, was later relocated atop the Hernshead. Jacob Wrey Mould had designed the pavilion in 1871 as a shelter for people waiting to change streetcars at Columbus Circle in the southwest corner of the park. Though no drawings remain of the original Ladies' Pavilion, Mould designed a similar shelter at the southeast corner, on Fifth Avenue, between 1871 and 1872. When the USS Maine Monument was installed on the shelter's site, the cast-iron elements were disassembled and stored, to be re-erected on the Hernshead. The exact date of the pavilion's relocation is unclear: some accounts give a date of 1904, while others cite the 1930s. The Ladies' Pavilion declined over time due to rust and vandalism, and though individuals and groups advocated for the restoration of the Ladies' Pavilion, vandals destroyed the structure in 1971. The pavilion was partially rebuilt with some of its overhead panels in 1973, though the city deemed a full renovation to be too expensive, as it would have cost $95,000. Six years later, it was completely restored in a project funded with a $7,000 grant from the Arthur Ross Foundation and a $150,000 donation from a Japanese donor. =Loeb Boathouse= Loeb Boathouse CafeThe Loeb Boathouse, on the eastern shore of the Lake, is one of several boat landings that have existed on the Lake throughout its history. Boating concessions were granted in the early 1860s, and rowboating on the Lake soon became popular. Six docks on the Lake were built by 1865, although the boats were stored near Bethesda Terrace. In 1870, Olmsted and Vaux suggested the construction of a permanent boathouse to launch and store the boats, and the Victorian style boathouse was finished by 1873 or 1874. However, it fell into disrepair in the mid-20th century and was destroyed by 1950. A new boathouse, financed by a $305,000 donation from businessman Carl M. Loeb and another $110,000 from NYC Parks, was completed in 1954. In 1983, the boathouse was renovated for $750,000, and a 40-seat restaurant opened within the boathouse. Today, the Loeb Boathouse contains a formal dining room, dining terraces, and concession stands, as well as a rowboat rental. = Other nearby structures = Vista Rock is on the northwest corner of the Lake, just above the 79th Street transverse. With a height of , it is the second-highest point in Central Park. Atop the rock is Belvedere Castle, a folly built in 1869‚Äì1871. Though it originally had no doors or windows, these furnishings were installed when the castle was used as a weather station from 1919 to 1960. Today, Belvedere Castle serves as a visitors' center. The Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre is just northwest of the Lake and west of Vista Rock. Originally prefabricated in Sweden and formerly known as the Swedish Schoolhouse, it was shipped to the U.S. for the 1876 Centennial Exposition before being relocated to Central Park. A 200-book nature library was opened in the structure in 1901. Since 1947, it has housed one of the nation's last marionette companies. Strawberry Fields, a landscaped memorial, is southwest of the Lake. It is dedicated to the memory of former Beatles member John Lennon, who was murdered outside his nearby home, the Dakota. The memorial was dedicated in his honor in 1981 and rebuilt completely in 1985. Its most notable feature is the \\"Imagine\\" memorial mosaic in the center.  History  = Construction and opening = Seen in May 2015 The Ramble and Lake were two of the first features to be built in Central Park. Together they formed the northern end of the Central Park Mall, the only formal feature in the Greensward Plan. The Lake was formed from part of the Sawkill Creek, a natural creek which flowed near the American Museum of Natural History. The creek ran through the park site, south of Seneca Village, originally exiting the park under Fifth Avenue near East 74th Street, where Conservatory Water lies today, before emptying in the East River. (Egbert Viele's 1856 survey forms the \\"Pre-Park Site, 1857\\" map) To create the Lake, the outlet was dammed with a broad, curving earth dam, which carries the East Carriage Drive past the Kerbs Boathouse (1954), at the end of the Lake's eastern arm. In late August 1857, after Central Park's construction was approved, workers began building fences, clearing vegetation, draining the land, and leveling uneven terrain. The Lake was the first feature to be completed, partially due to the fact that it was being filled from water that was drained from the adjacent Ramble. It opened to the public as an ice skating ground that December. The Lake's center was seven feet deep, with terraced shorelines to lower levels for skaters' safety. The Ramble, the second section of the park to be completed, formally opened in June 1859. The Ramble and Lake soon gained popularity: while 15,000 people visited the Ramble daily in July 1859, this number grew to 20,000 by late August, 40,000 by mid- October, and 50,000 by Christmas that same year. The Greensward Plan was required to include a musical venue, and the original plan was for a music stand to be placed at the Rumsey Playfield, above the Mall and just south of the Lake. The first concert in Central Park occurred in the Ramble on July 6, 1859, and later on, concerts also occurred in the Lake. However, concerts in the Ramble were a short-lived phenomenon. A concert pavilion in the Mall, at the top of Bethesda Terrace, was approved in 1862, and by the pavilion's completion three years later, most of the concerts had shifted to the Mall. = Decline = The maintenance effort of the Ramble and Lake, as did the rest of the park, declined slightly in the early and mid-20th century. In 1927, mayor Jimmy Walker commissioned Herman W. Merkel, a landscape designer, to survey the park and create a plan for improvement. Merkel's report noted that while the condition of the Ramble was \\"disreputable\\" with its many dead plants and trees, Central Park's overall condition was \\"fairly good\\". Some structures were closed or demolished in the mid-20th century. The Cave was closed by 1934 due to crime. The deteriorating boathouse on the Lake was closed in 1950 and replaced in 1954. By 1971, the Ladies' Pavilion had also been destroyed by vandals, though it was replaced two years later. =Restoration= Oak Bridge spanning Bank Rock Bay was replaced in 2009 following Calvert Vaux's original design of 1860 The Ramble was partially restored in the late 20th century. These renovations started with the Ladies' Pavilion, which was restored to its original design in 1979. In early 1981, the Central Park Conservancy cleared trees in the Ramble to allow more sunlight to reach the Ramble. However, this decision was criticized by birders, who said that the destruction of trees would remove shelter places for birds. The restoration of the Gill was subsequently approved in 1982. A path in the Ramble, Iphigene's Walk, was dedicated in 1987 to one of the key backers of the Ramble's 1980s renovation. The Central Park Conservancy renovated the Lake's shoreline starting in 2006, in a project to enhance both its ecological and scenic aspects. In mid-2007, the first phase of a restoration of the Lake and its shoreline plantings commenced, with replanting using native shrubs and understory trees around the northern end of the Lake. In the earliest stages, invasive non-native plants like Japanese knotweed were eradicated, the slopes were regraded with added humus and protected with landscaping burlap to stabilize the slopes while root systems became established and leaf litter developed. Bank Rock Bridge was recreated in its original materials following Calvert Vaux's original design of 1859‚Äì60. The replacement bridge was made of steel, clad in ornamental cast iron facings, with a wooden deck. The new bridge was rededicated in September 2009. The cascade, where the Gill empties into the lake, was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form, inspired by paintings of Asher B. Durand. Sections of the Lake were dredged of accumulated silt‚Äîtopsoil that had washed off the surrounding slopes‚Äîand the island formerly in the lake, which gradually eroded below water level, was reconstructed in mid-2007 with rugged boulders along its shoreline, graded wetland areas, and submerged planting shelves for water-loving native plants, like pickerel weed. Birdwatching Birdwatching in the Ramble The Ramble is one of the major centers of birdwatching in Central Park. At least 250 species of birds have been spotted over the years, including more than 20 species of warblers that pass through during spring and fall migration in April and October. One of the most popular birding spots is Azalea Pond, along the waterfront. Dogs are required to be on leash at all times in the Ramble. A viral video in May 2020 depicted a racially-charged confrontation involving a white woman walking her dog who threatened to call police on black birdwatcher Christian Cooper, who had asked her to put her dog on a leash.  Cruising  Since at least the early 20th century, the seclusion of the Ramble has been used by gay men for cruising. In the 1920s, the lawn at the north end was referred to as the \\"fruited plain\\", and in the 1950s and 1960s, the Ramble was feared by many as a haven for \\"anti-social persons\\". In the early 1960s, under Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., the Parks Department proposed building a senior center in the Ramble with the hope of curbing cruising and anti-gay assaults. In 1980, an ad was placed in The Village Voice looking for gay men interested in playing soccer in the Ramble, giving rise to the New York Ramblers, among the world's first openly gay soccer clubs. Today, the Ramble's reputation for cruising has given way somewhat to nature walks and environmentalism. However, some in the gay community still consider the Ramble to be \\"ground zero for outdoor gay sex\\", enjoying the \\"retro feel\\" of sneaking off into the woods.

A Christiansen filter is a narrow bandpass or monochromatic optical filter which consists of an optical cell which is stuffed with a crushed substance (e.g. glass) and a (mostly organic) liquid. The liquid is chosen according to the substance, so that the dispersion curves coincide at one wavelength. For this wavelength the filled optical cell behaves like a plane-parallel, homogeneous disk and allows transmission. All other wavelength ranges of the spectrum are reflected, scattered as well as refracted at the many interfaces between substance and liquid. A change of the transmission behavior of this dispersion filter can be achieved by variation of the liquid, the temperature or variation of the pressure. The fundamental consequence is the change of the refractive index of the liquid. A typical filter is composed of glass particles immersed in a mixture of benzene and carbon disulfide. The wavelength of operation can be varied by changing the percentage of the two components of the liquid mixture, or by varying the temperature.  Bibliography  * C.

(1963). Hoot Toot & Whistle: The Story of the Hoosac Tunnel and Wilmington Railroad. Brattleboro, Vermont: Stephen Greene Press. History The legislatures of Vermont and Massachusetts granted a charter to construct the Deerfield Valley Railroad in 1884, and a narrow gauge railroad was constructed over the from Hoosac Tunnel to Readsboro, Vermont by 1885. In 1886 control of the trackage in Massachusetts was transferred to the Hoosac Tunnel and Wilmington Railroad. However, the final of track to Wilmington were not laid until 1892, when control of the entire line was transferred to the HT&W.; In 1913 the line was converted to , though an array of over of logging railroads that were laid at various times near Wilmington and Readsboro remained narrow gauge. The railroad was used to haul materials for the Somerset Dam in 1911, and the Harriman Dam in 1924, both of which were owned by the New England Power Company, which purchased the railroad in 1920. Originally the power company did not want to relocate the portion of the railroad flooded by the Harriman Dam, but was forced to by the citizens of Wilmington. The power company sold the railroad to local investors in 1928, who operated the railroad until a major flood in 1936 destroyed a bridge near Mountain Mills in Vermont. The railroad was sold again at that time, and the portion north of Readsboro was abandoned in 1937. Operations continued on the remaining portion until 1971, when the line was finally abandoned.

Armee) was a World War II field army. Operation Barbarossa On 22 June 1941, the 17th Army was part of Army Group South when Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union. From 1 July, the Hungarian \\"Mobile Corps\\" (Gyorshadtest) was subordinated to the 17th Army. Along with 1st Panzer Army, the 17th Army encircled Soviet forces in central Ukraine during the Battle of Uman. Approximately 100,000 Soviet troops were captured. The 17th Army participated in the Battle of Kiev. Army Group South was ordered to resume the offensive, with the objective of capturing Rostov-on-Don, the gateway to the Caucasus oil fields, and Kharkov, a major center of heavy industry for the Soviet Union. In October 1941, the army came under the command of Hermann Hoth, who was convicted post-war in the High Command Trial. Hoth was an active supporter of the war of annihilation (') against the Soviet Union. He called upon his men to understand the need for \\"harsh punishment of Jewry\\". In support of the Severity Order issued by Walter von Reichenau in October 1941, in November 1941 Hoth issued the following directive to troops under his command: Under Hoth's command, units of the 17th Army took part in the hunt for and murder of Jews in its territory of control. Battle of Stalingrad In 1942, Army Group South was to spearhead the German summer offensive in Russia known as Case Blue. The 17th Army was to give flank protection to 1st Panzer Army as it struck towards the Don River. From June to July, the German 17th Army, the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia, and the Romanian 3rd Army were organized as \\"Army Group Ruoff\\". In August 1942, Hitler sub-divided Army Group South into two new army groups: Army Group A and Army Group B. Army Group A included the 17th Army, the 1st Panzer Army, and the 4th Panzer Army. Army Group B included the 2nd Army, the 6th Army, the Italian 8th Army, and the Hungarian 2nd Army. By October 1942, the Romanian 3rd Army and the Romanian 4th Army were added to further bolster Army Group B. While Army Group B struck towards Stalingrad, Army Group A and the 17th Army attacked towards the Caucasus oilfields in what was to be known as the Battle of the Caucasus. However, by December with Soviet forces en-circled the 6th Army at Stalingrad, Army Group A withdrew from Southern Russia but 17th Army was ordered to hold the Kuban bridgehead. Hitler demanded a three-mile road and rail bridge across the Strait of Kerch in spring 1943 to support a push through the Caucasus to Persia, although the Cable Railway (Aerial tramway) which went into operation on July 14 with a daily capacity of one thousand tons was adequate for the defensive needs of the 17th Army in the Kuban bridgehead. Because of frequent earth tremors, vast quantities of extra-strength girders would be required, and their transport would curtail shipments of military material to the Crimea.Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer, Chapter 19 (1969, English translation 1970) Crimea By October 1943, the 17th Army was forced to retreat from the Kuban bridgehead across the Kerch Strait to Crimea. During the following months, the Red Army pushed back the German forces in the southern Ukraine. In November 1943, they eventually cut off the land-based connection of 17th Army through the Perekop Isthmus. Hitler forbade a sea evacuation of 17th Army because he thought the Red Army could use the Crimean Peninsula to launch air attacks against Romanian oil refineries. By the end of 1943, the Soviet command began landing troops in Kerch Strait and, by 10 April 1944, moving troops near the Sivash and together with an attack at the Perekop Isthmus forced 17th Army to fall back to Sevastopol. The German Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) intended to hold Sevastopol as a fortress, much as the Red Army had done during the first battle for the Crimea from 1941 to 1942. Inadequate repair to the defenses of Sevastopol made this impossible and, on 9 May 1944, Sevastopol fell in less than one month after the start of the battle. The Army lost much of its heavy equipment in the Crimea. Considerable losses were suffered in terms of men lost in battle and losses associated with the sea evacuation. The Army was subsequently reorganized and continued to fight on the Eastern Front, including in the Battle of Bautzen.

History EICO was established in New York City in 1945 by radio repair business owner Harry Ashley to manufacture electronic test equipment in kit form. His first product, advertised in the July 1946 Radio News, was the model 113 VTVM/audible signal tracer. A wide variety of test equipment remained the company's mainstay during the time it was in the electronics business, however EICO often augmented their product lines with what was thought fashionable. For example, in the late 1940s it offered Geiger counters in response to public interest in uranium prospecting. Sales by December 1956 were said to be over one million instruments. Their largest secondary market was audio equipment. Starting in 1958, EICO produced amateur radio equipment often in kit form, such as the EICO 720 and 730 transmitters. Later in the 1960s they made the EICO 753 SSB transceiver for amateur radio use. They also sold specialty test equipment for the ham radio market, including signal generators and grid dip oscillators. First located at 84 Withers Street in Brooklyn, New York, and later at 33-00 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, EICO produced hi-fi products in the early 1950s to the mid-1960s with a line of tuners, preamplifiers, and amplifiers, available both in kit form or fully assembled. The model EICO HF-81 integrated tube amplifier is just one of several highly regarded products manufactured by EICO during this period. EICO is also known for \\"monoblock\\" amplifiers such as the HF-50 and HF-35, stereo integrated amplifiers such as the ST-40 and ST-70, as well as many other amplifiers and preamplifiers. In the late 1960s, EICO introduced a line of solid state electronics audio equipment referred to as Cortina, but by the mid-1970s the only audio products they sold were kits manufactured for them in South Korea.

The mall was originally named Confederation Park Plaza when it opened in mid-1973, at which time its anchor tenants were Canada Safeway and Woolco. The mall was originally planned for a location on Saskatoon's east side, at the southwest corner of Clarence Avenue and Circle Drive (site of the present day Saskatoon Auto Mall), but in May 1972 Saskatoon City Council rejected the plan citing community concerns. As a result, the mall's developers looked to build on an alternate site on the city's west side. However plans for a mall in the area around what is now Confederation Park had existed at least as early as 1966. In 1994, Woolco became Wal-Mart, and around this same time the mall underwent an expansion that added a food court and a new Safeway store; the original Safeway location became part of the food court with the remaining space used for a third anchor tenant, initially a branch of the Family Video home video rental chain, and later Petland. Other stores include clothing stores, electronics, services, florist, banks and jewelers. http://www.confederationmall.ca accessed February 3, 2007 In the summer of 2009, a new Wal-Mart was constructed in a new power centre commercial area in the Blairmore Suburban Centre several kilometres west of Confederation Mall; the one in the mall closed and in 2010 was renovated to house a Canadian Tire (with Mark's Work Wearhouse) that opened in 2011 (in turn, the new Canadian Tire replaced a standalone location that had operated in the nearby Plaza 22 shopping centre since the 1970s). The new Canadian Tire and Marks is a standalone, as its connection to the rest of the mall was closed. This resulted in a portion of the mall being reconfigured to house a new anchor, Winners, which is accessed from inside the mall. This was followed by the launch of a major interior renovation to the mall which, as of 2015, was to expand the food court and add a restaurant.

The book was written shortly after Armstrong had won the 1999 Tour de France: he went on to win it six further times in successive years, establishing a record (later revoked due to his use of performance-enhancing drugs). In 1996, he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain, and was only given a 40 percent chance of living. This disrupted his career, but his success on his return prompted elements in the media to accuse him of doping.

Retrieved on 2008-01-30. A subsequent autobiographical installment, entitled Every Second Counts and also with Sally Jenkins as co-author, continued the narrative until his 2003 Tour victory. Following investigations into doping allegations against him, Armstrong was stripped of all his seven Tour titles on October 22, 2012. In Jan 2013, he confessed that some of the allegations were true. In light of Armstrong's confession, the passages about doping in the book are false or doubtful.

After Dr Wolff suggests Armstrong to get an opinion from Dr Lawrence Einhorn‚Äîthe foremost expert on testicular cancer‚ÄîArmstrong went to the Indiana University medical centre in Indianapolis. He decided to receive the rest of his treatment there. On October 25, Armstrong's brain lesions were removed by Dr Scott Shapiro. For the three remaining chemo cycles Armstrong was given an alternative protocol, VIP, by Craig Nichols ‚Äî the primary oncologist. Armstrong completed chemotherapy on December 13, 1996, and by February 1997, he was declared cancer-free. In 1997, Armstrong launched the Lance Armstrong Foundation to support those battling cancer.

Part of a series of similar works depicting daily public entertainment at the time, it shows a group of singers performing a scene from the opera Don Giovanni, the only work by Degas depicting an operatic performance without dancers. Les Choristes, and other contemporary works of the artist such as Caf√©-Concert at Les Ambassadeurs, show the influence of French caricaturists of the era. Honor√© Daumier is often invoked, but critics and art historians have identified others. Critics at the time praised it, with one suggesting that the singers' \\"hideous\\" faces made them seem more real. After its initial exhibition, Les Choristes was purchased by Gustave Caillebotte, a fellow painter and friend of Degas's who used his own large inheritance to support fellow Impressionists. Caillebotte bequeathed it to the state upon his death in 1894, which added it to the collection of the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in Paris, and then later exhibited it at the Louvre. In 1986 it was moved to the Mus√©e d'Orsay with other works of modern art. At the end of 2009, while on loan to the Mus√©e Cantini in Marseille, the work was stolen. Investigators were unable to find any leads. It was recovered in 2018 when customs inspectors found it in the luggage compartment of a bus they searched in the department of Seine-et-Marne outside Paris; however, the thieves have not been identified. After being found to be relatively undamaged, it was displayed again at the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Description The work is a pastel drawn over an earlier monotype, a technique Degas used for some other works around this time, also depicting performers. While some of them led to multiple works, Les Choristes is the only one known to have been derived from this particular monotype. It is rectangular, almost square, high by wide. It depicts a line of singers along a stage, seen from just to their left and slightly in front. They are illuminated by footlights from in front. All have open mouths; most also have a hand extended towards the audience. The exceptions are the third singer, who seems to be reaching back towards his chest, and the fourth singer behind him, who appears to be raising a sword. They are wearing predominantly orange and yellow costumes. The faces of the singers in the foreground are distinct, although lacking detail, reflecting the Impressionist aesthetic of the work. In the very background two box seats can be seen overlooking the stage, with patrons, one above the other on a red wall. Degas signed the image at lower left. Degas told Daniel Hal√©vy that the scene depicted is one from a specific opera, Mozart's Don Giovanni. Specifically, it is the end of the first act, with the chorus celebrating the engagement of Massetto and Zerlina. While other works by Degas depict operatic performances, this is the only one that shows only singers, without any dancers. Don Giovanni had not been performed much in Paris until 1866, when Jean-Baptiste Faure, who had commissioned works from Degas, was able to apply his baritone to the title role, after which there were many productions. At the time of Les Choristes, Degas had also illustrated Hal√©vy's father Ludovic's Monsieur Cardinal, which takes place backstage during a performance of the opera. Several of those illustrations depicted dancers preparing for, or in, other scenes from Don Giovanni. Reception and analysis alt=A black and white portrait photograph of a man with his hair cut very short and a goatee wearing a suit jacket with a high collar. He is looking ahead to his left, past the viewer Gustave Caillebotte, a painter who used his large inheritance to support many of the early Impressionists, bought the work from Degas and lent it to the Third Impressionist Exhibition in 1877, soon after it was finished. The title was shortened to simply Choristes. Critics at the time saw it as furthering Degas's place as the Impressionist most concerned with realism in his choice of subjects and representation. \\"And the hideous chorus, bawling in full voice,\\" wrote one admirer, \\"aren't they real!\\" Many critics, looking at all of Degas's work in the show, saw the strong influence of caricature on his work. In particular, they compared his figurative stylings to Honor√© Daumier, whom Degas admired to the point of owning several of his works. La Petite Republique Fran√ßaise went further, comparing Les Choristes and other paintings depicting performers offstage and on‚ÄîCaf√©-Concert and Dancers at the Barre among them‚Äîfavorably with the work of Paul Gavarni and Alfred Gr√©vin. \\"No one, including [them], has seen the world of the wings and the caf√©-concert in as humorous a fashion\\", the journal wrote. \\"[The works] are a collection of true and witty satire.\\" Appreciation for the work, as part of those Degas showed in 1877, did not diminish with the passage of time. In 1897, when the work was put on exhibit at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, L√©once B√©n√©dite called Les Choristes part of a group of \\"acute, ironic and cruel observations ... the work of a firm, sure hand [and] just, sensible eye.\\" He called them \\"little masterpieces\\" that a public not generally aware of Degas's genius had done well to acquire. History After the show ended, Caillebotte took Les Choristes back into his private collection. He lent it out for one other exhibit, another show focusing on the Impressionists, in New York in 1886. In this exhibit it went under the title Chorus d'Op√©ra. At his death eight years later, he left all his art to the state, and Les Choristes was exhibited at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. During World War I, it was again included in American traveling exhibits, this time to San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Buffalo. After being included in a Degas retrospective in 1924, was transferred to the Louvre in 1929. alt=An ornate building, with peaked roofs at either end and large clocks on their fronts, under a blue sky with clouds, seen from its front right For the next 80 years Les Choristes did not leave Paris. It was part of several different exhibits devoted to pastels and Impressionism at the Louvre, and then transferred to the newly opened Mus√©e d'Orsay in 1986. It was part of a special exhibit of Degas works two years later. =Theft and recovery= In 2009 the Orsay loaned Les Choristes to the Mus√©e Cantini in Marseille for \\"De la sc√®ne au tableau\\" (\\"The Scene in Painting\\"), a multi-artist exhibit. On the last morning of the year, shortly before the exhibit ended, the security guard who opened the museum for the day found the painting missing. The thieves had apparently just unscrewed the frame and taken the work, valued at ‚Ç¨800,000, off the wall. Investigators believed that, as in many cases of art theft, they had had some help from someone working at the museum. They detained and briefly interviewed a night watchman, but could find no reason to hold him, and released him. After that they had no leads. It was serendipitously recovered a little over nine years later. On February 16, 2018, French customs officers pulled over and searched an intercity bus off an exit from the A4 autoroute in Ferri√®res-en-Brie, east of Paris in the department of Seine-et-Marne. They were primarily looking for illegal drugs, since smugglers prefer bus routes to ship them. They did not find any drugs on this occasion, but inside a suitcase in one of the luggage compartments was a small artwork; none of the passengers said it was theirs. They soon confirmed that it appeared to be the missing Les Choristes, although they did not know if it was authentic despite the Degas signature. Experts from the Orsay soon confirmed that it was, and it was undamaged. Several days later, in a joint news release, the customs agency and the Ministry of Culture announced the recovery of Les Choristes. Culture Minister Fran√ßoise Nyssen praised the customs service for \\"the fortunate recovery of a precious work whose disappearance had been a great loss to our national Impressionist heritage.\\" G√©rald Darmanin, Minister of Public Action and Accounts, said \\"the constant vigilance of customs\\", which had seized 10,000 possibly stolen works of art during 2017, had again proved its value in protecting French heritage. The previous year, the Orsay had marked the centenary of Degas's death with an exhibit of his work focusing on his relationship with Paul Val√©ry. The museum announced that it would include Les Choristes in an exhibit of the artist's work depicting opera, set to open in September 2019. After that, the exhibit will travel to Washington, D.C., where it will open at the National Gallery of Art in March 2020.

Fields wrote, produced and directed the movies 416, Saving The Indian Hills, Preserve Me A Seat, Plain Living and, most recently Bugeaters, currently in production. Prior to his film work, Fields wrote and directed the musical comedy Little Red and the play Scarlett Fever. Fields is a nationally known independent filmmaker who has championed issues of concern to the Midwest and of film lovers in general. He is the owner of the independent film production company Apartment 101 Films. Early life James Wallace Fields was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in September 1958. Fields was educated in the Omaha public schools. Starting in his childhood, Fields took an intense interest in film. An early photograph that appears in Saving The Indian Hills depicts Fields at age 16, standing in front of the Indian Hills Theater,Indian Hills Theater which housed the largest indoor movie screen ever constructed. Designed by the architect Richard L. Crowther, the Cinerama theater was considered his greatest achievement. Its unique curved screen provided a 3-D effect that caused moviegoers to feel themselves immersed in the film‚Äîespecially wide screen movies such as Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Zhivago and Star Wars. Early career After graduating from the University of Nebraska, Fields wrote the play Little Red about the 'Bugeaters', a 1915 University of Nebraska football team that went on to become the Cornhuskers. Fields himself produced and directed Little Red in Omaha. The success of his first play led Fields to write, produce and direct Scarlett Fever, a dramatic play about a 76-year-old woman who wakes up one day and believes she is Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind. The success of Scarlett Fever led Fields to acquire his first digital video equipment which he used to produce and direct his first feature film: Plain Living. Saving The Indian Hills In 2001 Fields found himself swept up in a brewing controversy in Omaha. The aforementioned Indian Hills Theater was sold to Methodist Health Systems, which announced its intention to demolish the theater for a parking lot. A group of Omaha activists formed to save the Indian Hills Theater and Fields was on hand, filming. The preservation fight became a cause c√©l√©bre, resulting in letters from Hollywood legends pleading for the theater. Such legends included Kirk Douglas, Leonard Maltin, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Ray Bradbury and Patricia Neal. Despite these pleas and a recommendation for the theater as a city landmark by the City of Omaha's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Methodist Health Systems began demolition of the theater shortly after the theater had been declared a landmark. 416 The movie 416 is named after Initiative 416, Nebraska's referendum banning same-sex marriage. Fields takes a balanced approach to the issue as he plays the initiative's backers against Nebraskans who oppose the measure, which passed with support from 71% of Nebraska voters. 416 purported to give an objective view of the issue but most reviewers suggested the film was highly critical of the religious right. Preserve Me A Seat Although the activists did not succeed in saving the theater, Fields captured their tumultuous efforts on film and this resulted in two films: Saving The Indian Hills and footage that later became the core of Preserve Me A Seat. The later film enlarges the focus of Saving The Indian Hills to the entire United States. It presents the story of the Indian Hills Theater Preservation Society, the Omaha group that formed to save the theater, in context with the companion stories of similar groups that formed in other cities with the intention of saving their own theater palaces from the wrecking ball. Because of the controversy surrounding its Indian Hills Theater elements, the film's premier faced long delays while litigation got resolved. The world premiere occurred in Grand Island, NE Nebraska. After the feature a lively panel discussion occurred featuring the film-makers and theater developer, Paul Warshauer. The common thread of the theater preservation efforts within Preserve Me A Seat is their lack of success. This film has seen wide distribution at film festivals across the country. Bugeaters Fields' latest work is a documentary film about the 1890 University of Nebraska football team, entitled Bugeaters.  Work as a producer  As is common with independent producer/directors, Fields has produced all of his works. Themes Much of Fields' oeuvre presents the struggle of the common man against entrenched power. His movies portray ordinary people engaged in extraordinary battles in which their lack of power does not equate with a lack of passion. Awards Fields' film 416 was chosen as Best Feature in the Central Nebraska Film Festival.

It forms a busy gateway into the main campus of the George Washington University, which owns the property. As the 2000 Block of Eye Street, NW, the houses were named a DC Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places, both in 1977. History =Early history= The original buildings on the site were thirteen row houses constructed between 1831 and 1896. The homes were located on a block bordered by H, I, 20th, and 21st Streets, NW. The houses were mostly initially owned by merchants, who kept small shops inside. The block originally faced Western Market, founded in 1803; the site of the market is a park today. Facades of some of the houses The largest unit in the block was a corner structure, at 832 20th St. and 2004 I St. Three stories tall, it was constructed with a flat roof and metal cornice; imitation stone covered the facade. The building began life as a pair of independent shops, owned separately, before later being combined. The earliest Washington city directory, published in 1822, lists a grocery store owned by Christian and Matthew Hines on the corner. Grocers have continued to occupy the site into the twentieth century. The corner store was sold in 1837 to Samuel Stott, whose family owned it for decades thereafter. The current building, believed to be his work, was known by the middle of the century as \\"Stott's Hall\\". Its third floor was a public hall. Though the exact date of its construction is uncertain, in 1869 the assessed value of 832 20th St. rocketed from $2500 to $6000, indicating a major remodeling; it is believed that the current building was built at an earlier date and remodeled around that year. The construction date of 2004 I St. is unknown, but it is believed that the house was built at around the same time as its neighbor. This structure was owned by Owen Murray, a grocer, in 1869; he sold it to Stott in 1876. Other occupants of the property included Francis Jarboe, George Fillebrown, and William Brown, the latter running a grocery store on the site beginning in 1872 and continuing past the turn of the century.Adapted from \\"832 20th st. and 2004 Eye st.\\", informational sign inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. 2006 I St. was constructed in the Greek Revival style around 1846, and has been remodeled several times since then. It is distinguished by its cornice, deep and with wooden dentil blocks. The original owners of the house were the Murray family, who were probably its builders as well. Owen Murray operated his grocery elsewhere on the block between 1843 and 1853; later, at 2006, one Patrick Murray is listed in 1863 as owning a restaurant in the space. Beginning in 1869 John Leamy appears in the city directory as a restaurateur in the same place, continuing until 1871; in 1876 John Ohl is listed as proprietor of a restaurant and saloon. He purchased the building from the Murrays; he continued to own it past 1888, when its occupant, John Werner, kept a saloon on the site. The building has continued to serve in various commercial capacities, including again as a restaurant recently.Adapted from \\"2006 Eye st.\\", informational sign inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. 2018 I St. was constructed in 1886. Its builder was carpenter Richard Fowler, member of the firm F.A. Conrad & Co. and resident in the neighborhood. The house, in Victorian style, has a corbeled brick cornice; its pressed brick facade, unaltered since it was built, is broken by a variety of arched windows, in different sizes. The house is three stories tall, with four bays and a flat roof. A combined residential and commercial space, the house was built for the Eikers, a family of merchants ‚Äì Isaac Eiker and his sons, who sold butter, had moved to the site in 1876, and family members ether ran stalls in several area markets or were the proprietors of grocery stores. They owned the building well into the 20th century; more recently, it has served as office space.Adapted from \\"2018 Eye st.\\", informational sign inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. 2022 and 2024 I St. were constructed by former DC territorial governor Alexander Robey Shepherd between 1874 and 1875.Adapted from \\"2022 and 2024 Eye st.\\", informational sign inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. They were the central two units in a row of four, and were built as mirror images of each other, under a mansard roof. Not long after the buildings were completed, Shepherd sold 2022 I St., to Isaac Filbert, a contractor; Arthur W. Fairfax, a grocer, was listed as the building's tenant in 2022. His family continued to own it until it was purchased by the Foley Company in 1960. Shepherd continued to own the house at 2024 I. St., likely renting it out until his flight from the city, whereupon it was handed over to his creditors. 2040 I St. and 825 21st St. were completed in 1879 by Robert Earl, along with a third unit (2038 I St.), now demolished. Earl is listed in records as having lived in the neighborhood, on H St. between 20th and 21st, as early as 1830; for over forty years he ran a livery stable nearby. His son, Charles, took over in 1874, moving the business a short distance to 19th St. 2040 I St. is not owned by George Washington University, the only structure on the block which is under different ownership.Adapted from \\"2040 Eye st. and 825 21 st.\\", informational sign inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. =Later uses= By the time George Washington University took possession of the houses, some were vacant, and the block was generally in poor condition. Corner units at 2040 I St. and 825 21st St.; in 2013, when the picture was taken, these structures housed a Johnny Rockets Battles to preserve the row of houses began in October 1976, when the developer who owned several of them began demolishing the house at 2022 I St. Don't Tear It Down (forerunner to the DC Preservation League), a group of historical preservationists organized in 1971 to save the Old Post Office building from destruction, convinced a judge to order a temporary restraining order stopping destruction, as a request to declare the entire block a historic landmark was pending at the time. The developer then attempted, in November, to demolish the house at 2030 I St.; this structure was already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, however, and the state historic preservation officer invoked a delay of 180 days. Discussions with the community did not even begin until the 179th day, and a thirty-day extension to the stay was granted. When this expired, the developer began demolition of the house; preservationists managed to get a restraining order in time to preserve the front half of the structure. Citing the requirement for \\"meaningful discussion\\" as laid out in a previous historic preservation case, Don't Tear It Down argued that they had not been able to adequately present their case; while the presiding judge stated that \\"meaningful discussion\\" was \\"beyond the court‚Äôs comprehension\\", he nevertheless issued an injunction preventing further demolition before the case could be heard by the DC Court of Appeals. In the event, historic preservation legislation was passed in 1978 before final adjudication, saving the buildings from destruction. The current design of the property is the result of discussions with local preservation groups. Construction of the office building, between 1982 and 1983, involved demolishing the backs of the houses while retaining their facades; it was the first time the practice of partial demolition was used in Washington, DC. The thirteen buildings were joined together during construction of the shops and office building; some of their original materials were retained for the finished product. Work began on the complex on December 28, 1982; it was named on October 19, 1983. In addition to office space, the complex contains restaurants and other commercial establishments, including a Bertucci's and a CVS Pharmacy. The office building has sometimes been called the Cruise Ship Building due to its appearance. The block as a whole is sometimes called Red Lion Row, a name taken from Lindy's Red Lion pub which was situated at its corner until late 2018. Western Market (Present Day) The 2000 Penn complex is currently being renovated to include more vendors, additional entrances, and various other modernizations with a layout similar to Eastern Market.

Coffman Memorial Union, the main student center, is named in his memory. Career overview Lotus Delta Coffman, son of Mansford Coffman and Laura Davis, was born January 7, 1875 in Salem, Indiana. He married in Salem on December 28, 1899 to Mary Emma Farrell born September 12, 1877 Paoli, Indiana, daughter of William H.H.P. Farrell & his first wife Mary A. Wible. Coffman was a graduate of Salem High School in 1892 and a graduate of Indiana Normal School at Terre Haute, in 1896, where he played quarterback on the football team. He earned an AB degree from Indiana University, 1906; an AM degree there, 1910; a Ph.D. at Columbia, NY, 1911. He later received a LLD from Indiana University and from Carleton College in 1922; a LLD from Columbia University, 1929 & a LLD from the University of Michigan, 1931; a LHD from University of Denver, 1930 and a DS degree in education from George Washington University, 1930. Coffman was principal of Salem, Indiana schools from 1900 to 1903; Superintendent of Salem schools 1903‚Äì1906; superintendent of Connersville School 1906‚Äì1908; director of training at Charleston, Illinois Normal School 1908‚Äì1912; dean of education at the University of Illinois 1912‚Äì1915; Dean of the College of Education at the University of Minnesota 1915‚Äì1920; and President of the University of Minnesota 1920‚Äì1938. He was a visiting professor for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to New Zealand and Australia 1931; visiting lecturer at the University of the Philippines 1932; member of the National Board of Education to do research in Russia and visit Poland & Germany; was a consultant to the US Department of Interior on a Land Grant College Survey 1928‚Äì1930; and advisor to the Surgeon General on education of disabled soldiers during WWI. He started at the University of Minnesota with a $12,000 annual salary. The university then had 8,200 students on campus. There was $6.5 million spent on maintenance of the campus annually. The School of Education enrolled 600 and had 50 faculty members. The Music School building was under construction in 1920. After 10 years as president, the university's property values had increased more than 100%; the budget increased 68%; enrollment increased 60% in undergraduate classes and over 100% in graduate studies; staff increased from 479 to 825 with 25% having the rank of professor‚Äîbecoming the third largest university in the US. During Coffman's time the Memorial Stadium was built, Northrop Auditorium and the Walter Library were added; and the Mayo brothers (Wm J. & Charles H.) gave the university $2 million for endowment of the Mayo Foundation for Graduate Medical Study and Research. Coffman's watch on the university included vigorous surveillance of alleged campus \\"radicalism,\\" the number of Jews admitted to the university, and determined promotion of racial segregation in the university's dormitories. Black students mistakenly placed in university dormitories at admission were forced to leave, often after just one night's residence. Coffman rejected student protests. Despite a student-led substantial report comparing the university's segregated housing with integrated housing at other universities, Coffman insisted that \\"the races have never lived together nor have they ever sought to live together.\\"Pres. Coffman to John R. Pinkett Sr., Oct. 5, 1931, in University Archives, Office of the President, Administration, Box 20, folder 19, pg. 34. Coffman's administrators compiled lists of \\"radical leaders\\" and numerical counts of Jews and blacks who had been admitted to the university, practices that continued throughout Coffman's presidency. University housing was integrated in 1938 only when the historian Guy Stanton Ford succeeded Coffman as President after Coffman's death. Housing segregation was briefly reintroduced when Walter Coffey succeeded Ford as President in 1941, but protests forced Coffey to abandon the attempt.Sharyn Jackson, \\"New Exhibit Reveals U's Dark History of Segregation and Anti-Semitism,\\" Minneapolis Star Tribune, Sept. 12, 2017. http://www.startribune.com/new-exhibit-reveals-u-s-dark-history-of- segregation-and-anti-semitism/443978873/ After a year's leave of absence due to a heart attack at his summer home in Battle Lake, Minnesota in July 1937, he resumed his job in July 1938.

They were originally classified E, and generally known as \\"E-tanks\\"; They were reclassified E1 in the time of D. E. Marsh.  Construction and use  The first six locomotives of this useful and long- lived class were built at Brighton and appeared in traffic between September 1874 and March 1875. They performed well and further orders were placed at regular intervals until December 1891 when the class consisted of eighty locomotives and were used throughout the LBSCR system, principally for goods and shunting, but occasionally for secondary passenger duties. In 1884 Stroudley also built one example of the class (No. 157 Barcelona) with a larger boiler and Gladstone-type cylinders with valves underneath to work on the steeply-graded lines between Eastbourne and Tunbridge Wells. This Special E-tank was withdrawn in 1922.  Rebuilds and withdrawals  E1 No. 2133 (formerly LB&SCR; no. 133 Picardy) in early British Railways livery, before renumbering - circa 1949. E1/R 0-6-2T No. 32124 piloting a Bulleid Light Pacific at Exeter St David's 16 July 1949 After 1894/95 the class gradually began to be replaced by R.J. Billinton's radial tanks of the E3 and E4 classes. Withdrawals commenced in 1908 when one locomotive was broken up for spares, and others were withdrawn at intervals until May 1914, when the increased need for locomotives during the First World War meant that there were no further withdrawals. One locomotive (no. 89) was rebuilt with a larger boiler by D. E. Marsh between January and June 1911 and reclassified E1X; it was renumbered 89A in October 1911, and 689 in December 1912. However this was rebuilt as an E1 in 1930 once the boiler was condemned. Under Southern Railway ownership, withdrawals continued during the 1920s, with some examples sold to industrial railways rather than scrapped. Eight examples were also rebuilt as 0-6-2 radial tank engines for use in the west of England. These were classified as E1/R. Four E1s were also transferred for duties on the Isle of Wight: three were shipped from Southampton on 4 July 1932 and a fourth on 16 June 1933. Before transfer, they were overhauled at Eastleigh Works, painted green, renumbered W1-W4 and given names related to the Island. *136 (originally Brindisi) became W1 Medina. *152 (originally Hungary) became W2 Yarmouth. *154 (originally Madrid) became W3 Ryde. *131 (originally Gournay) became W4 Wroxall. Nos. W1‚ÄìW3 were allocated to Newport, and no. W4 was at Ryde. They were primarily intended for goods traffic, but were used on passenger trains where necessary. At speed they were unsteady, but after no. W4 was successfully rebalanced at Ryde Works in October 1933, the others were modified similarly during 1935‚Äì36. Thirty examples survived the transfer of ownership to British Railways in 1948 but during the 1950s they were gradually replaced by diesel shunters. The last survivor, BR no 32694, was allocated to Southampton Docks. It was withdrawn in July 1961 and scrapped at Eastleigh Works later that year. The four on the Isle of Wight worked goods trains until route closures in the 1950s brought a reduction in their duties. When repairs became due, they were withdrawn from service instead of being overhauled: no. W2 was withdrawn in September 1956, no. W1 in March 1957, no. W3 in June 1959 and no. W4 in October 1960.  Preservation  One example, No. B110 (originally No. 110 Burgundy) was sold in 1927 to the Cannock and Rugeley Colliery Company. They gave it the number 9 and named it Cannock Wood, and it worked their internal system until 1963. After withdrawal it was bought for preservation and moved between several sites before restoration began in 1986 and it returned to action at the East Somerset Railway in 1993. It was withdrawn prematurely in 1997 requiring firebox and boiler repairs, and spent many years in pieces awaiting overhaul, although in 2011 it was cosmetically restored into (inauthentic) BR black. In 2012, B110 was sold to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, in return for LMS Ivatt Class 2 no. 46447 moving to the ESR.

It is dedicated to the restoration of steam locomotives formerly operated by the New Zealand Railways Department, with its goal to restore at least one locomotive to main line operating conditions in order to operate excursions from Dunedin Railway Station. The society is currently the only one of its kind in Dunedin; the Ocean Beach Railway operates small tank locomotives but on private trackage, and the popular Taieri Gorge Limited is run solely by diesel locomotives. The restoration of P 107, also using some parts from the remains of P 25, is currently the focus of Project Steam's efforts. The two locomotives were built in 1885 by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company, entered service in 1887, were withdrawn in 1928, and on 8 August 1932 were dumped in the Clutha River near Beaumont to protect the Roxburgh Branch from erosion. Their remains were recovered in May 1992, and as the frame of P 107 was in a better condition, it was chosen for restoration, with extra parts sourced from P 25, most notably its wheels, which were in better condition to P 107's. During the celebration of the Dunedin Railway Station's centennial in October 2006, P 107 was displayed in partially rebuilt condition at the station. Funds are currently being raised for the next and most costly stage of the restoration, the reconstruction of P 107's boiler. The restoration is historically significant as the locomotive is one of, if not the earliest known surviving example of a British-built . Once fully restored, there are proposals to establish a regular service run by P 107 as a tourist attraction, such as a service modelled on the Kingston Flyer. It would run over the preserved track of the Otago Central Railway between Pukerangi and Middlemarch, connecting with the Taieri Gorge Railway's daily diesel-hauled services between Dunedin and Pukerangi. Project Steam's first home was a location by the Water of Leith in central Dunedin. Later the group moved most of the restorable items to the Dunedin Gas Works, where the frame and wheels of P 107 were continued to be worked on while P 25's frame (cut into sections) could be found stored onsite. All other components such as spare wheels, old tender bodies and the boilers were moved to a field next to the Taieri Gorge Railway at Sutton. In 2008, with redevelopment occurring at the Gas Works necessitating the group's removal from the Gas Works, P 107 was shifted to Springfield and is now located at the Midland Rail Heritage Trust. It is understood that the group will continue to restore P 107 to operational order at Springfield.

The Cauld ('Cold') Hill O‚Äô Fare is near Banchory, some miles further down the Dee valley. Dool is the Doric dialect term roughly equivalent to 'Doom'. For a couple of centuries, the lairds did not seem to enjoy any particular good fortune, seemingly ending up always on the losing side. Blelack House is situated 30 miles west of Aberdeen, near the village of Logie Coldstone, 3 miles north of the River Dee in the Cromar, a basin of agricultural land carved out of the Grampian foothills. Blelack is an anglicization of the Gaelic Baile ailich meaning \\"village of the stone house\\". The prefix \\"Ble...\\" is found in the Outer Hebrides with regard to translations of Gaelic place names beginning Baile, in Ireland this would be \\"Bally...\\" . The Royal Deeside area was historically within the Earldom of Mar, and the Blelack estate belonged to a branch of the powerful Clan Gordon. In 1620 an \\"Alexander Gordoune\\" of Blelack is referred to in \\"The Records of Aboyne\\", and the location is shown on a Map of 1654. It is difficult to tell if the presence of a stone house here is earlier. Typical of such mansion houses, there is a nearby farm and a mill, both of similar age, and built of the distinctive local pink granite. There are, confusingly, two dates engraved onto the fa√ßade of the building, 1881 and 1892. There is some evidence that the current Blelack House is older, and these are renovation dates. Blelack House was burnt down in retribution after the Jacobite rising of 1745. The young laird, Charles Gordon, fought for Bonnie Prince Charlie, and was closely associated with several of the rebellion's leaders. The new mansion house was built on the present site in 1753. The building suffered an accidental fire later in 1868 and was rebuilt and remodelled the following year. We can only speculate on the extent of the changes to the house over the centuries; the current building seems to pre-date the Mock Baronial style of the later nineteenthth century. During the Victorian era Blelack ceased to be the laird's seat and was used as a shooting lodge. In World War II pupils from Albyn School for girls in Aberdeen were evacuated to the house. The building was split up into separate flats in 1976.

It is currently anchored by Canada Safeway and London Drugs, and has almost 100 shops and services. A third anchor bay housed a Zellers department store from the mall's opening until October 2012; it was later replaced by a Target store until the Canadian Target chain closed in 2015. The mall opened in October 1980 during a period of rapid growth in the city's north end subdivisions. On opening it covered 23,225 square metres and had the first enclosed food court in Saskatoon, along with many independent and franchise chains (including the city's first purpose-built mall video arcade) and was promoted as one of the province's largest suburban malls; it also boasted the largest Safeway store in Saskatchewan. Future plans for the mall at the time were for a second department store to join Zellers in a future phase, but ultimately Zellers (later Target) remained the only department store in the mall. The mall underwent a major expansion in 1990 that nearly doubled its footprint, though in lieu of a new anchor tenant, a new food court was built. A further expansion in 2002 added London Drugs as the mall's third anchor. In September 2011 it was reported that Target Canada, as part of its takeover of the Zellers chain, had purchased the leasehold for the Lawson Heights location with the possibility of it being converted to a Target store in the future.Three Target stores proposed for Saskatoon, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, Sept. 23, 2011, retrieved Jan. 6, 2012 This was later confirmed and the Zellers location closed in October 2012 to permit an expansion of the location to the west and south to accommodate the larger Target store.

History =Formation= The great bravery of the 43rd Highlanders (later renumbered the 42nd) and the admirable service which they rendered at the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745, made the Government anxious to avail themselves still further of the military qualities of the Highlanders. Authority, therefore, was given to John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun to raise another Highland regiment under the patronage of the noblemen, chiefs, and gentlemen of that part of the kingdom, whose sons and connections would be appointed officers. The regiment was raised at Inverness and Perth in August 1745 and the Earl of Loudoun served as its colonel throughout its short life. By 8 June 1745, the regiment numbered 1,250 men who were formed into twelve companies. By August 1745, the regiment consisted of twenty companies of men. Loudon's regiment was an entirely different unit to the eighteen Independent Highland Companies who they are often confused with, and which were raised by Duncan Forbes of Culloden starting in October, 1745. =Jacobite rising of 1745= The regiment fought at the Battle of Prestonpans in September 1745,Blaikie (1897). p. 90 where they were defeated and many were taken prisoner, but later released. Three companies of Loudon's Highlanders fought for the British Government against the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, where they were victorious, alongside one company of Highlanders from the 43rd Highlanders, otherwise known as the Black Watch. During the battle, Captain Campbell and six soldiers of the regiment were killed, with two more wounded. In the aftermath of Culloden, the regiment was involved in the search for the Jacobite leader, Charles Edward Stuart, and under Grant of Knockando, they nearly caught him at a hut at Torvault on 23 August 1746, but he managed to escape.Blaikie (1897). pp. 64-65 =War of Austrian Succession= The regiment was ranked as the 64th Foot in 1747. It served at the siege of Bergen op Zoom where it distinguished itself and suffered over one thousand casualties out of a complement of 1,450. It was disbanded in 1748. Officers Notable officers of the regiment included: *Captain John Murray, son of Lord George Murray, in turn son of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl, chief of Clan Murray (never actually served) *Captain Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet, son of Colonel Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet of Foulis, chief of Clan Munro *Captain Alexander Mackay, son of George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, chief of Clan Mackay *Captain Ewen Macpherson of Cluny, chief of Clan Macpherson (later joined the Jacobites) *Captain John Sutherland of Forse, of Clan Sutherland *Lieutenant John Robertson or Reid, of Straloch, who died in 1806, at the age of eighty- five, a general in the army and colonel of the 88th or Connaught Rangers.

After spending its first four years at 92.1 FM, KJRG-FM relocated to its current frequency in 1963. For four decades, the station aired a Beautiful music/Easy listening format. In 1976, KJRG-FM changed call letters to KOEZ.

The ratings quickly dropped. The station was the Wichita affiliate of the Dallas-based morning show Kidd Kraddick in the Morning (which moved to KFBZ in December 2005). In the fall of 2002, the station flipped to \\"92.3 the Zone\\" with an automated Modern AC/Modern Rock format. One year later, the station would revert to Hot AC as \\"The New 92.3.\\" In September 2004, KMXW flipped to a gold-based Rhythmic Adult Contemporary format as \\"Magic 92.3\\". None of these attempts garnered any ratings success. On January 16, 2007, KMXW flipped to classic country as \\"Classic Country 92.3\\". The call letters were changed to KFTI-FM. Almost instantly, the station jumped back into the top 10 in the ratings. On July 30, 2014, it was announced that the E. W. Scripps Company would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm will retain their broadcast properties and spin off their print assets as Journal Media Group. KFTI-FM, their sister radio stations in the Wichita area and 2 TV stations were not included in the merge; in September, Journal filed to transfer these stations to Journal/Scripps Divestiture Trust (with Kiel Media Group as trustee). With the merger, the grandfathered ownership clause that Journal had was voided, forcing a sale of one of the Journal stations to meet ownership limits. On October 10, 2014, Journal announced that the station will be sold to Wichita-based Envision, a non-profit blind advocacy group, under their newly formed broadcasting division, for a price of $1.55 million. Blind Advocacy Group Acquires 92.3 KFTI Wichita Journal also announced that the format and KFTI call letters will be moved back to 1070 AM after a -year absence; at midnight on October 22, KLIO dropped ESPN Deportes for a simulcast of KFTI-FM. The simulcast continued until the approval of the sale on December 12, 2014. Envision applied to change KFTI-FM's call letters to KKGQ upon the closing of the sale. Although Envision is a non-profit organization, the station will continue to operate with a commercial license. In addition, Envision registered several website domains with \\"Q\\" in the address, including Q92TheBeat.com, Q92TheBeat.net and Q92TheBeat.org, as well as anonymous domains for Q92Wichita.com, Q923Wichita.com, 923QFM.com and 923TheQ.com that were registered when the sale was announced (Q92Wichita.com would be picked as the official domain).\\"Envision Sets Plans For 92.3 Wichita\\" from Radio Insight (December 10, 2014) At Midnight on December 13, 2014, KKGQ broke from the simulcast, and began stunting with music from blind musicians, as well as construction sound effects and greeting messages from Envision employees. At 6 a.m. on the 15th, the station shifted its stunting to Christmas music, now using the moniker \\"Santa Q92.\\" At 6 a.m. on December 26, the stunting shifted towards playing a wide variety of music from multiple genres (while leaving hints of a possible contemporary music direction based on the stunting), now utilizing the station's intended moniker \\"Q92.\\" At a press conference on December 30, KKGQ announced that Brett Harris and Tracy Cassidy (formerly of KRBB) will host mornings beginning January 5. At Midnight on January 1, 2015, KKGQ began airing a 6-hour program of smooth jazz music titled \\"The Oasis\\", which aired in overnights for a brief period. (The \\"Oasis\\" name is based on a former Wichita station of the same name). At 6 a.m., the station officially flipped back to Rhythmic AC, branded as \\"Q92 The Beat\\", and used the slogan \\"The Best Mix 90s to Now.\\" The second go-around with the format had a playlist focused on pop and rhythmic hits from the 1990s to the current day (as well as some current pop-rock songs for balance) instead of the 1970s and 1980s focus its \\"Magic\\" predecessor had. Over the course of 2015, the station added more Hot AC material to the playlist, with the complete shift to the format completed on October 1 (most of the Rhythmic AC material had been moved to the evening hours), though the station did retain a rhythmic lean overall. By February 2017, KKGQ changed their slogan to \\"Today's Best Mix & Throwbacks\\", dropped much of the rhythmic component of their playlist, and dropped the \\"Beat\\" portion of their slogan, rebranding as just \\"Q92.\\" On April 5, 2017, Envision announced that they would merge their broadcasting division with Manhattan, Kansas-based Rocking M Media, who were also in the process of acquiring KIBB and KVWF from Connoisseur Media. As part of the deal, Rocking M would relocate KIBB/KVWF's studios into KKGQ's current space in downtown Wichita, as well as integrating Envision's education programs for the visually impaired into its operations in all of their Central and Western Kansas stations. Rocking M took over KKGQ via a local marketing agreement on April 10, with the sale officially completed on September 22 at a price of $2.5 million. Rocking M Media to Merge with Envision Broadcast Network In addition, Harris and Cassidy would be let go from the station on April 19, and the station rebranded as \\"Q92.3.\\" During its tenure as \\"Q\\", ratings were in the upper 0s‚Äîmid-1 shares of the Wichita market, and often ranked as the lowest rated commercial station in the market. In the Spring 2017 ratings period, KKGQ held a 0.7 share of the market, whereas closest competitor KFBZ held a 3.6 share, and mainstream AC rival KRBB held a 4.7 share. Because of this, on September 5, 2017, at Midnight, after playing \\"Centuries\\" by Fall Out Boy, KKGQ flipped to country, branded as \\"Kansas Country 92.3.\\" The first song on \\"Kansas Country\\" was \\"Austin\\" by Pat Green.KKGQ Brings Red Dirt Country to Wichita On March 29, 2019, Rocking M announced they would sell KKGQ and its five sister stations in the Wichita/Wellington/Winfield area to Allied Media Partners, a local group owned by Matt Baty and Tommy Castor, for $6.2 million. Allied Media Partners would take over the stations via a local marketing agreement on April 1. Allied Media Partners Acquires Six in Wichita from Rocking M Media The FCC approved the sale in late May; however, the sale was not consummated due to Allied Media Partners' condition that Rocking M would clear all liens and outstanding debt on the stations in order for the sale to be completed. The completion date would be delayed a few more times, with a final scheduled completion date of October 31. On September 23, 2019, Envision, who owns the building that houses the station's studios, would lock the doors, denying staff members access to the station and offices; the non- profit organization claims that Rocking M was behind in their lease agreement. In response, Rocking M would take each station off the air that same day. Wichita Cluster Silenced as Allied Buy Implodes A week later, Allied Media Partners announced it would cease operations, and let go all employees, putting the future of the stations in jeopardy. Sale Conflict Takes Wichita Cluster Off the Air KKGQ would occasionally return to the air to air Kansas State Wildcats football games as part of the station's agreement with Learfield Sports to carry the games as the Wichita affiliate. On October 11, Envision would file a lawsuit against Rocking M in Harvey County District Court, claiming that Rocking M did not meet a payment schedule related to KKGQ's sale in 2017 and owes the company money (Envision is seeking $1.25 million plus interest, costs and attorneys‚Äô fees). It also wants a sheriff's sale of property related to the station and demands that Rocking M deliver all collateral to Envision. On November 6, Envision would file a second lawsuit against Rocking M in Sedgwick County District Court for failing to vacate the building that houses their stations' studios, along with leaving behind damaged property and failing to pay rent for parking spaces. In return, Rocking M would file a complaint with the FCC, hoping that the agency would force Envision to allow access back to the stations' studios, as well as to fine the company. In addition, Rocking M has stated that it hopes to still sell KKGQ and its five sister stations. Wichita Cluster Off-Air with Purchase of Stations Now in Jeopardy FCC Pulled Into Battle Over Rocking M's Silent Wichita FMs During the last week of January 2020, KKGQ would return to the air, this time operating from studios in Wellington, and would retain the country format, airing the syndicated \\"Brand\\" format from Envision Radio Networks (not related to the non-profit Envision; has since been renamed Sun Broadcast Group), and would subsequently rebrand as \\"92.3 The Brand.\\"https://www.kansas.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/carrie- rengers/article239810188.htmlhttps://radioinsight.com/headlines/184012/rocking- m-media-revives-two-of-its-wichita- stations/https://www.kansas.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/carrie- rengers/article239856058.html On August 28, 2020, the Harvey County District Court ruled in favor of Envision, awarding the company $1.2 million plus interest for what it said was Rocking M's breach of contract.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 19, 1987, during the third episode of The Tracey Ullman Show and marks the first appearance of the Simpson family ‚Äî Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie ‚Äî on television. After three seasons on Tracey Ullman's show, the shorts would be adapted into the animated show The Simpsons. \\"Good Night\\" has since been aired on the show in the episode \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" (in its entirety), along with several other Ullman shorts, and is one of the few shorts to ever be released on DVD, being included in the Season 1 DVD set. Plot Homer and Marge say goodnight to their children, but all does not go according to plan. Bart tries to ask about the mind, but is left contemplating it as he does not get a proper answer. Lisa fears that bed bugs will eat her after hearing Marge say \\"Don't let the bed bugs bite\\". Maggie is terrified by the lyrics of \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\". Ultimately, all of the three children decide to sleep in the parents' bed. Origins Groening first conceived of the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts, and had intended to present his Life in Hell series. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction. He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, and named the characters after his own family. Bart was modeled after Groening's older brother, Mark, but given a different name which was chosen as an anagram of \\"brat.\\" Production This short was written and storyboarded by Groening. Animation on the short began March 23, 1987. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead they just traced over his drawings. It was produced at Klasky Csupo, with Wesley Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators. The episode is sometimes considered to be the first episode of season 0 of The Simpsons. The show's production number is MG01. 11 seconds of the short were cut in syndication airings. The short consisted of 4 segments, lasting 24, 15, 33, and 33 seconds each. After the short plays from start to finish in \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\", Troy McClure, who now has a look of disbelief on his face, as though he has never seen the clip before, covers his expression with an awkward laugh and insincerely comments 'They haven't changed a bit, have they', a comment on how the characters' appearance and personalities had altered from the shorts to the airing of that episode. Critical reception FilmThreat says \\"This dark nursery rhyme is funny and disturbing. Homer‚Äôs voice is totally off the wall, nothing like it stands today, and it‚Äôs interesting to see how far they‚Äôve come since these early forays into animation\\". Todd Doogan of The Digital Bits was sad that \\"only [one] of the original Tracey Ullman Show shorts\\" was featured on the first season DVD\\". He added, \\"Still, the one you gets perfectly illustrates just how far the show has come\\". DVD.net describes it as \\"The Simpsons as some of you may never have seen before, drawn by the hand of Matt Groening himself and looking a little worse for wear.\\" DVD Movie Guide says, \\"I‚Äôve seen a few additional Ullman shorts and think they‚Äôre nearly unwatchable, so I can‚Äôt say I miss them, at least not for their entertainment value. However, they‚Äôd make a nice historical addition, so it‚Äôs too bad we only get this single clip. The first one ever aired, ‚ÄúGood Night Simpsons‚Äù runs for 115 unfunny seconds.\\" The Digital Fix says the short extra on the DVD \\"showcases the superb sense of humour that has made The Simpsons what it is today\\", and that \\"the picture quality is quite breathtaking (considering the age of these shorts) while the sound is standard DD2.0 Stereo\\". It adds that \\"it is a teaser for something we will supposedly never see (all 48 shorts on DVD)\\" and wishes they had chosen a short that hadn't been featured in a future episode (The 138th Episode Spectacular), and therefore released on the Season 7 Box set. Planet Simpson says \\"the drawing and animation were blatantly crude, thick-lined, and primary-colored\\" and that \\"the vignettes were far too short for anything as sophisticated as 'character development'\\". It adds that the \\"central gag [of] kids finding ironic horror in bedtime platitudes\\" was very simplistic, and doubts many people even watched the airing of the short. However, the book explains the significance of Good Night as \\"the first baby steps of an institution that would become one of the most-watched TV shows on earth and the most influential cultural enterprise of its time\\".

In the United Kingdom and many other countries, the council is responsible for all financial matters, the buildings and the appointment of the vice-chancellor. Academic affairs are the business of the university senate. In some cases the senate and council have equal status under the legislation that established the university. In other cases, such as Australia, the senate is technically responsible to the council, although the council is normally reluctant to enter into a discussion on academic issues. The membership of university councils consists of people from outside the university, often appointed by governments, along with some staff and, in some cases, students. The council is chaired by the university chancellor or a pro- chancellor or deputy chancellor.  United Kingdom  In most pre-1992 universities in the United Kingdom, Council is the governing body. (In post-1992 universities this is the Board of Governors; in the Ancient universities of Scotland this is the Court.) According to the Higher Education Code of Governance, the primary responsibilities of Council include appointing the executive head of the institution (normally titled the vice-chancellor), delegate powers of management to them, and monitor their performance. The Council is also the principal financial and business authority and the legal authority of the university, and the members of Council are the trustees of the university, thus Council may sometimes also be known as the Board of Trustees (e.g. the University of Bristol). Council will normally have an independent chair and (except for Oxford and Cambridge) a majority of \\"lay\\" members, not employed by the university. There is also \\"an expectation\\" in the Code of Governance that Council will contain representatives of staff and students (often the President of the Student Union) in addition to the lay members and the university's senior management. At some universities there are external ex officio members, reflecting their institutional history (e.g. the Dean of Durham at Durham University). In the Ancient Universities of Scotland, the General Council is the consultative assembly of the graduates and academic staff, created by the Scottish Universities Act (1858). These are completely different from the governing body Councils of other British universities, being equivalent to the Convocations of the Universities of Oxford and Durham and the Senate of the University of Cambridge.  United States  In the United States, the university council takes the form of a board of regents or trustees. = University of Pennsylvania = A different model is provided by the University of Pennsylvania. Its Bylaws of University Council, revised February 28, 2007, say \\"The University Council of the University of Pennsylvania is a deliberative and representative forum which exists to consider the activities of the University in all its phases, with particular attention to those matters that affect the common interests of faculty, staff, and students. It shall recommend general policies and otherwise advise the President, the provost, and officers of the University. It is authorized to initiate policy proposals as well as to express its judgment on those submitted to it by the administrative officers of the University and its various academic divisions. It is also empowered to request information through appropriate channels from any member of the University administration. \\"In its deliberative role, as it undertakes to reach collective decisions on policies initiated or evaluated for recommendations to officers of the University, an important function of the University Council is to transform the interests of its various constituency groups into forms congruent with the interest of the University as a whole. In such a case, a majority decision should be articulated in terms of the University's general welfare and constructed to advance this welfare. In its representative role, an important function of the University Council is to inform officers of the University--as well as the citizens of the University at-large--of the views and strength of views held by members of the University community. In this public expression of a heterogeneity of views, without their resolution into an agreement for action, may serve the University Council's advisory purpose authentically, and especially when such a diversity of discourse increases understanding among constituencies in addition to revealing the breadth of considered opinion as a ground for accommodation in subsequent University decision-making.... \\"Membership on the Council requires a readiness to attend meetings of the Council regularly and to participate fully in its business, including the work of its committees. It is the continuous obligation of the members of the Council to report to the members of their constituencies about the discussions, the decisions, and recommendations of the Council and to solicit questions and suggestions for presentation to the Council.\\" The President of the University of Pennsylvania is the presiding officer of the University Council. The President, or in the absence of the President, the provost, turns the conduct of the meeting over to a moderator, who is a Presidential appointee and a non-voting member of the Council. The President also appoints a Parliamentarian, in consultation with the Steering Committee. The Secretary of the University shall be the Secretary of the Council and the Secretary of the Steering Committee. Members of the University Council include forty-five members of the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate, one full-time lecturer, one full-time member of the research faculty, eleven administrative officers of the University, fifteen graduate and professional students, fifteen undergraduate students, two representatives of the Penn Professional Staff Assembly, one representative of the Librarians Assembly, two representatives of the Weekly-Paid Professional Staff Assembly, and one representative of the United Minorities Council.

In the end, Shane Peltzman, Ron Newrauter, Alejandro Rose-Garcia, Lacey Elick, Heather Ichihashi, and Cree Howard are eliminated, leaving 14 players to compete in the game, where the grand prize is of their choice. Fate Falls The 14 Endurance players compete in the partner selection challenge, where a colored ball representing the 7 team colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and gray) will drop from a match stick- like pyramid. The person who catches the ball chooses the guy and girl for that colored team. Jon Crocilla and Sabrina Lloyd become the Yellow Team, Aaron Thornburg and Jonna Mannion become the Blue Team, Christian Justice and Ashley Gudzak become the Red Team, Trevor Wilkins and Lana Neiman become the Green Team (even though Trevor was originally to be paired with Chelsea Myers), Brandon Hendrix (who was originally to be paired with Lana) and Layla Brisco become the Purple Team, Skyler Russell (who was originally to be partnered with Layla) and Chelsea becoming the Orange Team, leaving Max DeLeo and Jenna Jimenez as the Gray Team. Later, the team chooses their Pyramid Pieces: Perseverance (Yellow), Courage (Blue), Leadership (Red), Commitment (Green), Strength (Purple), Luck (Orange), and Heart and Trust (Gray). The teams then choose their grand prize trips: Belize (Yellow), Africa (Blue), Australia (Red), the Amazon (Green), Costa Rica (Purple), Bali and Komodo (Orange), and the Galapagos Islands (Gray), and the game begins... Tilt The 7 teams compete in their first Endurance mission: one member of each team is harnessed to a pole on a platform and must hold on to their partners. The winning team is the team that manages to hold on the longest. In the end, the Blue Team comes out on top, receiving the Knowledge and Discipline Pyramid Pieces, and control over the Samadhi, which will allow them to handicap another team, which will leave them at a heavy disadvantage in the first Temple Mission. The Red, Yellow, and Gray Teams form an alliance to go against The Brotherhood, an alliance consisting of the Blue, Orange, Green, and Purple Teams. However, at The Rock, the season's official meeting place, the Blue Team betrays their own alliance by giving the Samadhi to the Orange Team. They crack the Samadhi open, revealing a rope with 3 knots in it... Knotted Up In the first ever Temple Mission, the teams have to untie a huge knot in their team-colored rope, and the first team to do so wins. Because they got the Samadhi, the Orange Team has 3 additional knots to untie. In the end, the Blue Team scores a second consecutive victory. In order to get rid of the Green Team (because Trevor has begun to annoy everybody), the Blue Team sends the Gray Team up along with them, hoping that the Green Team will be sent home. Shockingly, the plan backfires and the Gray Team is the first to be eliminated. Plant the Flag The six remaining teams are shocked when the Blue Team receives a note from the Gray Team, accusing them of betrayal. Once this is cleared up, the teams compete in their next challenge: the players on both teams are connected by a pulley system; while one member plants one of five flags onto their team triangle, the other member retrieves the next one. The winning team receives the Gray Team's Heart and Trust pieces, the Samadhi, and the option to trade their trip for the Gray Team's. The Yellow Team wins, but they decide to keep their trip to Belize. Lana learns that Trevor has told the others about what happens at the Temple of Fate, so she tries to cover up the secrets. After taking a surprise survey at The Rock, the Yellow Team gives the Samadhi to the Purple Team, which contains a note that forbids them from competing in the next Temple Mission. Squeeze Play With the Purple Team banned from the Temple Mission, the five other teams are left to compete. Based on the survey taken the previous night, they have to show their answers via colored rocks. Every time a player gets a question right, they move up farther into a pyramid. As they play, teams will be squeezed out, and the winner is whoever can get all of the questions right and reach the top. In the end, the Red Team scores a victory and they choose to send the weakened Purple Team, along with the Orange Team, to the Temple of Fate. After Layla and Chelsea spend some time together, both teams went up to the Temple, where the Purple Team becomes the second team to be eliminated. The First Six Days A recap special of the first six episodes, with deleted scenes, and a preview of the remaining seven episodes shown at the end. Waterlogged The teams compete in their third Endurance mission, where one member of each team holds onto a rope attached to a huge bucket, while the other players put water in them, in hopes of making the bucket heavy for one team and forcing them off the platforms that they are standing on, which will make them lose. The winner receives the Purple Team's Strength piece, the Samadhi, and the option to trade their trip for a chance to go to Costa Rica. Despite Lana's best efforts, the Yellow Team scores their second victory, but they once again decide to keep their trip to Belize. The alliance between the Red, Yellow, and Blue Teams (formed after the Gray Team was eliminated) began to falter as Ashley targets the Blue Team for their pieces and Sabrina considers giving the Samadhi to the Red Team. Ultimately, the Orange Team gets the Samadhi for a second time, and the handicap is that 1 foot of their rope will be cut in the next Temple Mission. Eruption The teams have to hold onto ropes attached to some water balloons, and the winner is whoever can hold on the longest without letting go, which will release the balloons. Because they got the Samadhi, exactly 1 foot of the Orange Team's rope is cut. In the end, the Blue Team wins yet another mission, but due to some manipulation from Sabrina, the Blue Team spares the Yellow Team and sends the Green and Orange Teams to the Temple of Fate, each for a second time. At the Temple, despite depending on their Luck piece, the Orange Team becomes the third team to leave the island. House of Cards In honor of those who built the Great Wall of China, the teams build their own walls, with chocolate acting as cement. The catch? The boys on all teams are buried in sand and have to hold their walls up, while the girls have to build them. In the end, the Green Team wins and receives the Orange Team's Luck piece, but they decide to keep their trip to the Amazon, instead of trading it for Komodo. Meanwhile, Ashley learns that Sabrina is turning against her, but they eventually learn that friendship is more important, and thus, they stick together. At The Rock, the Blue Team is given the Samadhi, which will give them a 15-second disadvantage in the next Temple Mission. Dial In The final 4 teams must crack a decrypted question (which team left Endurance first) and then give the right answer (Gray Team). Despite being forced to wait 15 seconds before starting due to the Samadhi handicap, the Blue Team still manages to score another victory. Later, they shock everyone when they decide to send the Yellow Team (because Aaron has found out Sabrina lied about having a crush on him), along with the Green Team, to the Temple of Fate, and Sabrina vows revenge if she returns. At the Temple, despite having the Orange Team's Luck Piece, the Green Team becomes the fourth team to leave the island. Build a Pyramid As the title suggests, the final three teams must use different shaped pieces to build a pyramid, and the winner receives the Samadhi, the Luck and Commitment pieces left behind by the Green Team, and the option to trade their trip for the Amazon. The powerful Blue Team wins for a sixth time, and decides to trade their trip to Africa for the Amazon. At The Rock, they give the Samadhi to the Yellow Team, but when given the decision to remove it, they pull it completely out of the game, creating a level playing field for the final Temple Mission. Leap of Fate The final 3 play in their last Temple Mission, where they must jump over their team-colored bars as they swing down at them. Whichever team can jump the longest will guarantee themselves a spot in the final two, while the other teams are automatically sent to the Temple of Fate. The Blue Team manages to score their last victory before the final challenge, and the Red Team becomes the last team to leave the island. Don't Drop the Ball Before heading to the Temple of Fate, the Yellow and Blue Teams compete for the Red Team's Leadership piece and their trip to Australia. They must hold up a huge ball and whoever drops it or lets the ball touch their heads loses. The Yellow Team wins, but turn down the chance to visit Australia. Going into the final competition, both teams are tied with five pieces (Blue has their Courage piece, the Knowledge piece, the Discipline piece, Green's Commitment piece and Orange's Luck piece; Yellow has their Perseverance piece, Gray's Trust piece, Gray's Heart piece, Purple's Strength piece and Red's Leadership piece). At the Temple of Fate, both teams compete in the final challenge, where the Blue Team wins it all and becomes the first ever Endurance champions. Reunion The 7 teams of Endurance reunite to relive some of their best and worst moments. During the special, the teams and the audience vote on which guy and girl they want to see return for season 2. The players vote for Max and Jenna (the Gray Team), but J.D. decides to wait until season 2 to reveal the final, official results. The special ends with a preview of the new season. Best of Endurance: California Another recap episode; this time, J.D. reviews the entire season.  Endurance Season Two - Desert: 2003‚Äì2004  The following episodes are the episode list for Endurance.

The thirtieth episode recaps the most dramatic moments of Endurance Season Two. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background: White;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom: 3px solid #6B8E23;\\" ! # !! Title !! Original Air Date } =Episode description= Drop-Out 20 all new contestants arrive in a desert in Baja, Mexico, where they get acquainted with one another before competing in the Right-to-Stay Challenge. This time, the contestants stand on a platform while holding onto a bar. If a player pulls the bar down too far, the platform will give away, leaving them dangling. The first three girls and guys to let go are automatically eliminated. In the end, David Cofresi, Glen Powell, Trey Griffin, Sarah Ruckreigle, Abbey Konz, and Simone Bouffard are eliminated, leaving 14 players to pick both their partners AND their team color. Wash Out The 14 remaining players prepare for the partner selection challenge, and almost every guy wants Jacquelynn Pointer as their partner, especially Wayne Williams. In the challenge, a colored ball (along with some water) will drop from above and whoever catches it is on that colored team. To make things interesting, J.D. puts a curtain in between the girls and the guys, so no one discovers their partner until the end. At the end, Wayne is partnered with Maryelle DeVitto, forming the Gray Team, Jacquelynn is paired with Phil Morelli, forming the Red Team, Annie Kim and Jeff Phillips become the Purple Team, Mike Lavigne and Keetin Marchi become the Green Team, Shep Allen and Calley Payne become the Yellow Team, and Tyler Burkhalter and Michelle Durand become the Orange Team, leaving Scooter Magruder and Christa Schultz as the Blue Team. After choosing their Pyramid Pieces: Discipline (Red), Trust (Blue), Knowledge (Orange), Leadership (Purple), Commitment (Yellow), Heart (Gray), and Teamwork (Green), J.D. reveals which season 1 contestants have returned: Max and Jenna, who form the Brown Team and receive the Perseverance piece. After announcing the grand prize: a trip to the Bahamas, many teams begin to set their sights on the Brown Team due to them having more experience. Tower of Power The 8 teams must race through an obstacle course, picking up blocks as they go, in order to form a tower. The first team to cross the finish line with 10 blocks wins the race. As an added twist, J.D. announces that this will be a Temple Mission, meaning one team will be eliminated, as usual. J.D. also reveals that the team eliminated will be able to give their piece to any team they want. The Green Team wins, and decides to send the Orange and Gray Teams to the Temple of Fate out of fear of retaliation from the other teams. At the Temple of Fate, despite their best efforts, the Gray Team is sent home first for the second time in a row. Fireball The Gray Team tells the Green team to \\"send Tyler home\\" in Endurances first trade of pieces. After the Gray Team gives their Heart Pyramid Piece to the Purple Team, the 7 remaining teams compete in their first Endurance Mission of the season, where a member of each team shoots a ball to their partner on a floating platform in the water. If they catch it, that person takes out any team they want. The last team is the winner. In the end, the Purple Team wins the game, receiving the Luck Pyramid Piece and the Samadhi. Tensions run high in the Orange Team, Phil and Jacqueline start a \\"relationship\\", the Brown Team gets to know everyone, and the Purple Team gives the Orange Team the Samadhi at The Cove, Season 2's meeting spot, giving them an extra ball to control in the Temple Mission. Rollerball The 7 teams compete in a challenge where they must guide a ball through a maze without letting it fall off the edge. The first team to put 2 balls in the basket at the end of the platform wins. Due to receiving an extra ball in the Samadhi, the Orange Team needs to put 3 balls in the basket to win. In the end, the Green Team wins their second Temple Mission in a row. After consulting Yellow, Brown and Purple, the Green Team sends the Red Team and the Orange Team to the Temple of Fate, shocking every team who thought they would pick Purple. The Orange Team wins again, sending the Red Team home and putting their Discipline Pyramid Piece up for grabs in the next Endurance Mission. Tide Pull The 6 remaining teams receive a message from the Red Team, giving their Discipline Pyramid Piece to the Blue Team and talking down to the Green Team. The teams then compete in a challenge where a team member will paddle out with a boat as far as possible. After 30 seconds, the other team members will try to pull in a teams' boat. The last one left wins. In the end, the Brown Team wins, receiving the Strength Pyramid Piece and the Samadhi. The Brown and Purple Teams battle each other while ensuring their hatred of Blue, Yellow confirms a Top 5 plan with Brown and Green, Calley talks about bullying on the beach, and the Brown Team shocks the Blue Team by giving them the Samadhi, giving them a 10-second delay before starting the Temple Mission. Halftime A look back at the season thus far, showing off a preview of the eighth through thirteenth episodes. On the Ropes As Blue plans revenge on Brown by sending them and Yellow to the Temple, the teams compete in a challenge where one team member must guide their teammate with a rope through a course of holes while the team member with the rope is blindfolded. The first team to reach the end wins. In the end, the Brown team wins, sending the Purple team and the Blue team to the Temple of Fate. At the Temple, the Purple Team wins, sending the Blue Team home and putting their Discipline and Trust Pyramid Pieces up for grabs in the next episode. Face to Face After the Blue Team gives the Purple Team their Discipline and Trust Pyramid Pieces to the Purple team, complementing them and Green on winning, the 5 remaining teams play in the next Endurance Mission. In this mission, teammates stand face-to-face while holding a rope and being suspended by bungee cords. The last team to hold on wins. In the end, the Purple Team wins, receiving the Courage piece and the Samadhi. Purple's lead makes them a target to worry about, Annie apologizes to Calley, and the Purple Team gives the Samadhi to the Brown Team, giving them a handicap of 2 feet in the Temple Mission. Cherry Picker At the Temple Mission, teams must put together 3 poles and transfer their team colored ball to the top of a tower. If the ball falls, the team must start again at the beginning. The team who gets 3 balls in their tower wins. Due to the Samadhi, the Brown team has an extra 24 inches (2 ft) added to their tower. In the end, the Purple Team wins, sending the Brown Team and the Yellow Team to the Temple of Fate. The Brown Team wins, sending the Yellow Team home and putting their Commitment Pyramid Piece up for grabs for the next day. Aqueduct The Yellow Team gives their Commitment Pyramid Piece to the Brown Team, talking the Purple Team down. In the Endurance Mission, the remaining four teams build an aqueduct (as the title suggests) using different sized pieces from the end to the barrel. The team whose water flows to the end wins. In the end, the Orange Team finally wins, receiving the Ingenuity Pyramid Piece and the Samadhi. The final four gets serious, friendships are tested, and the Orange Team takes the Samadhi out of the game, similar to last year, giving them a level playing field on one condition that could involve the Green Team... Plank Maze On a level playing field, the teams must move across planks from barrel to barrel, collecting lettered tiles as they go. A dead end means that the team must backtrack for another plank. The collected letters spell out a word that the teams must unscramble. If they fall, they must start from the beginning. The first team to get to the end and spell the word (\\"Leadership\\") correctly wins. In the end, the Green Team wins, sending the Purple Team and the Brown Team. The Brown Team wins, sending the Purple Team home and putting their 6 Pyramid Pieces (Leadership, Trust, Heart, Discipline, Courage, and Luck) up for grabs in the next competition. Pathfinder The Purple Team's removal changes the game forever. They tell the Orange team that they give them their 6 Pyramid Pieces (Leadership, Trust, Heart, Discipline, Courage, and Luck), not Brown as expected. In the final challenge before the finale, the teams compete to stay on the island. In the challenge, players use colored squares on game boards to make a path between points without going diagonally or crossing paths. The first to connect the paths correctly wins. Even though Green seems to have won, they make a mistake that causes the Brown Team to win, sending the Orange Team and the Green Team to the Temple of Fate. Green wins, sending them to the final round and send the Orange Team home, putting their 8 Pyramid Pieces (Leadership, Trust, Heart, Discipline, Courage, Luck, Knowledge, and Ingenuity) up for grabs in the final mission before the Golden Pyramids final round. The Home Stretch A look back at the season thus far, showing off a preview of the final two episodes, Final Mission and Finale 2. Final Mission As the title suggests, the final mission of Endurance 2 is a big shock. Orange's 8 Pyramid Pieces (Leadership, Trust, Heart, Discipline, Courage, Luck, Knowledge, and Ingenuity) are individually up for grabs in the mission. In an old \\"cat-and-mouse\\" style chase, the teams must take orange triangles from their opponent's basket and put it in theirs. In the end, even though the Green Team won, the teams split the amount of Pyramid Pieces at 4 each. The final count of pieces before the end was: Brown: 7 (Yellow's Commitment piece, the Strength piece, their Perseverance piece, the Luck piece, Gray's Heart piece, Blue's Trust piece, and Orange's Knowledge piece); Green: 5 (their Teamwork piece, the Courage piece, the Ingenuity piece, Purple's Leadership piece, and Red's Discipline piece). After receiving their pieces for the finals, J.D. gave the teams necklaces that look like the Temple (similar to the carved rocks of the first season) to remember their time at the beach, colored Green, Brown, and all of the fallen teams that left in order. This episode also segues into Finale 2. Finale 2 After the players say their goodbyes, the teams battle in the final challenge at the Temple of Fate, where the Brown Team wins it all and becomes the second Endurance champions. Best of Endurance 2: Desert This is another recap episode; this time, J.D. reviews the entire season.  Endurance Season Three - Hawaii: 2004‚Äì2005  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background: White;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom: 3px solid #6B8E23;\\" ! # !! Title !! Original air date } =Episode description= Casting Special A two-part special episode, where J.D. and the other Endurance crew members cast the contestants of Endurance 3: Hawaii. The Arrival 20 all new contestants arrive in Kauai, Hawaii, the location for the third season of Endurance. Once there, J.D. explains the rules to them and reveals a new twist: the contestants get to choose which guy and which girl gets a free pass on the right to stay challenge. After much debate, Reece Bors and Lindy Oest are the first two contestants to become Endurance players, though some of the newcomers feel this to be unfair since they were chosen entirely because of their looks. As for the other 18 newcomers, they are forced to face the right to stay challenge, where the contestants hang onto poles suspended over the water. As always, the first three girls and guys to let go and fall into the water are automatically eliminated, while the others become official Endurance players. This time around, though, the girls go first instead of the guys, and Eleanor Monahan, Vanetta Smith, and Taylor Madison are the first to be eliminated. The guys then prepare to compete for their right to stay and the episode ends... First Elimination The guys take the right to stay challenge and Marshall Kathedar, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Maden, and Brandon Anderson are the next ones to go, leaving the other 14 newcomers as official Endurance players. After spending the night together, the players talk about who they want as their partner, with most of the girls, except for Alex Reid, distrusting Monroe Gierl. The contestants then compete in the partner selection game, where a catapult hurls a numbered ball (balls numbered 1-14) at the player and they have to catch it, because lower the numbered ball, the better the chances they have of getting the partner they want. Demian Martinez gets the #1 ball, Lindi the #2 ball, Reece the #3 ball, Antonio Iannicelli the #4 ball, Chris Vanderweir the #5 ball, Bryanah Bascon the #6 ball, Willa Zhou gets the #7 ball, and Nicole Clark gets the #8 ball before the episode ends. Pick Your Partner The partner selection challenge continues as the players compete for the perfect partner. Bjorn Leu, gets the #9 ball, Alex gets the #10 ball, Sarah Baker gets the #11 ball, Rachel Lofton gets the #12 ball, Monroe gets the #13 ball, and Kareem Nugent gets the #14 ball. Then they get to choose their team color; Kareem chooses blue, Monroe chooses yellow, Rachel chooses red, Sarah chooses purple, and Alex and Bjorn become the Green Team. Then J.D. announces a twist that allows the lower numbered contestants to bump another player to a different color to get the partner they want. Afterwards, the selection process continues, as Nicole chooses orange as her team color, Willa joins Kareem on the Blue Team, Bryanah and Chris form the Gray Team, Antonio replaces Kareem as Willa's partner; Kareem then partners with Nicole, forming the Orange Team, Reese joins Sarah and forms the Purple Team, Lindi replaces Bryanah as Chris' partner (leaving everyone in complete shock), causing Bryanah to be partnered with Monroe and form Yellow Team, and Demian replaces Kareem as Nicole's partner, causing Kareem to be partner with Rachel and form the Red Team. Later, J.D. gives the teams their starting pyramid pieces: Teamwork for Yellow, Commitment for Blue, Trust for Red, Knowledge for Gray, Leadership for Orange, Discipline for Purple, and Heart for Green. J.D. then announces the grand prize trip to the Gal√°pagos Islands, and the episode ends. Headstrong The 7 Endurance Teams receive a shock when Eleanor, Vanetta, Taylor, Marshall, Tom, and Brandon return for a shot at becoming the 8th team on Endurance, the Brown Team. In the Headstrong challenge, the six returnees have to balance carvings between their heads and a bamboo pole and the person who lasts the longest wins and gets to choose their partner for the Brown Team. After almost a half an hour, Tom wins and chooses Vanetta as his partner, forming the Brown Team and receiving the Perseverance pyramid piece. Afterwards, Tom immediately forms an alliance with Kareem because of their friendship together, while Monroe is angry with Tom for not choosing Taylor, whom Monroe considers a close friend, as his partner. Ring of Fire The eight teams compete in their first Endurance mission. The challenge involves the teams holding onto a pole in a ring. If the pole touches the ring, the ring will catch fire and that team is out. The last remaining team wins. In the end, the Purple Team wins the Strength piece and the Samadhi. Willa loses her temper at Antonio because she thought they lost due to him not helping her. The Purple Team gives the Yellow Team the Samadhi. The Yellow Team finds a rope inside. Bagging on You The teams compete in their first Temple Mission meaning one team will be eliminated. The teams must throw two bags tied together to a platform some distance away in the water. If their bags are on the platform, that team gets to eliminate any team who missed theirs. The Yellow Team has to stand a few feet further back due to the Samadhi. However, they shock everyone by winning and send the Blue and Orange Teams to the Temple of Fate. The Blue Team becomes the first team to leave. Squaring Off The Blue team gives their Commitment piece to the Orange Team, tying them with Purple for the lead. J.D. then tells everyone that the next challenge is a temple mission meaning another team will be leaving right after the first team left. The challenge involves the teams one at a time each putting a triangle on another team's group of squares. The last remaining team wins. In the end, the Orange Team wins after the Gray Team eliminates themselves. The Orange Team sends Yellow and Green to temple. The Yellow Team wins sending the Green Team home. Out on a Limb The Green Team gives their Heart piece to the Yellow Team. The teams then get a surprise when the next Endurance Mission isn't for a pyramid piece or a Samadhi. Instead the winning team will make Super Teams (three teams on each) to compete against each other in the following Temple Mission. The challenge involves the girls sitting on the end of a seesaw while the guys hold onto ropes attached to the seesaws to keep the girls up for as long as possible. The last remaining team wins. In the end, the Yellow Team wins and gets the power to make Super Teams. The Yellow Team makes their Super Team of Yellow, Purple, and Gray thinking they have the strongest teams. The other Super Team is Orange, Brown, and Red and Tom is disappointed that he wasn't chosen to be on Monroe's Super Team. From 20 to 12 A mid-season recap with a preview for the remaining ten episodes. Bamboo Jungle The two Super Teams compete in another Temple Mission where they have to go through an obstacle course made of bamboo and go back through in order to win, making all three winning teams safe from going to Temple. When Vanetta isn't moving quickly for her team to win, The Yellow-Purple-Gray Super Team wins and Brown and Red are forced to go to Temple. The Red Team ends up being the third team eliminated. Pipeline The Red Team gives their Trust piece to the Purple Team, putting them in the lead with three pieces. The teams compete in a challenge that involves both team members working together to get three large balls across a pipe using poles. But the Samadhi up for grabs will benefit any teams who wins or receives it. In the end, the Gray Team wins their first challenge by themselves and wins the Samadhi. They crack it open and are given two options: steal another team's pieces or switch partners with another team. The Gray Team decides to take the Yellow Team's two pieces (Teamwork and Heart) tying them with Purple while the Yellow Team is left with nothing. I'm Pulling for You The teams compete in another Endurance Mission that requires the team members to pull themselves with ropes in order to get triangles to the shelves on top. The first team to get twelve triangles to the top wins. In the end, the Gray Team wins their third mission (second independent) and gets the Courage piece and the Samadhi. The Courage piece puts the Gray Team in the lead with four pieces and the Yellow Team gets the Samadhi for a second time forcing them to sit out the following Temple Mission. Balance Ball Chris vows to send the Yellow Team if the Gray Team wins the Temple Mission. Shockingly, Vanetta of the Brown Team pulls out of the game due to hurting her knee and needing stitches. Tom decides to continue, however, as a one-person team. The Temple Mission has the players transporting balls on boards from one end of the field to the other before sliding the ball into their chute. If the teams drop any of the balls, they must start back from the start. The first team to get three balls into their chute wins. The Yellow Team sits out because of the Samadhi. Tom ends up failing without his partner and the Purple Team wins, sending Tom and the Yellow Team to temple. Unfortunately, Tom is sent home alone. The Halfway Mark Tom gives the Yellow Team his Perseverance piece, putting them back in the game. The teams then compete in a thinking challenge where they must make a triangle while following a dot pattern on them. The dots must match in order for a team to win. In the end, the Yellow Team wins earning the Luck piece and the Samadhi. The Gray Team ends up getting the Samadhi which has them wait until a ball is caught before participating in the next Temple Mission. The Final Four The next challenge has the players filling a pouch with water, dumping it in one of three tubs, and waiting for balls (numbered 1-3) to shoot out of the three cannons behind the tubs. Because they got the Samadhi, the Gray Team has to wait until the first ball is caught before going into the game. In the end, the Orange Team wins and Gray and Purple both go to temple for the first time where the Purple Team is sent home. Create Your Own Game Purple leaves their three pieces to their allies on Gray, giving them a tremendous lead in the final three. In yet another Endurance first this season, the remaining contestants are allowed to create their own game, with the reward being the final Samadhi and the Ingenuity piece‚Äî what they end up devising is a challenge where the males direct the blindfolded females toward five of their team-colored triangles, while trying to avoid the tiki statuettes scattered on the field. Gray wins their third mission, making their lead of pyramid pieces insurmountable for the Yellow and Orange teams. At the island, the final Samadhi is not removed from the game for the first time in the series' history; despite Yellow's statement of doing so that Gray creates a level playing field for the second-to-last day, they give them their third Samadhi this season‚Äî what's inside is a tablet with \\"1\\" inscribed on it, indicating that Yellow will have one extra row in the final Temple Mission Final Elimination After some relaxation in the rivers of Kauai, the final three teams participate in the final Temple Mission. For the challenge Color Coded, each team must figure out a code of marks underneath each colored disc in seven rows, while correctly memorizing that at the same time in any event of a mistake‚Äî after several rounds, Orange's luck holds out as they pull off an upset win, securing their place in the final two. As a result, Gray and Yellow are automatically sent to the last Temple of Fate‚Äî on their third trip, Yellow is defeated by Gray, and they become the final team to exit the game. Battle for the Pieces In the final mission of Endurance: Hawaii, the Orange and Gray teams will compete for the two pieces left behind by Yellow, Luck and Perseverance. Beforehand, they decorate a pair of rafts that serve as a memorial to the fallen teams from that season, who were also their friends and allies; later on, they use those same devices in an old-fashioned boat race which circumnavigates the island lagoon they're on‚Äî four burlap triangles are stationed throughout, with only one housing the Luck piece, whereas the Perseverance piece is at the finish line. The long-standing conflict between Nicole and Demian climaxes during the mission, weighing Orange down significantly, and easily allowing Gray to win the two pieces in contention‚Äî the official score heading into the final Temple is Gray leading with 10 (their Knowledge piece, Yellow's Teamwork piece, Green's Heart piece, the Courage piece, Purple's Discipline piece, the Strength piece, Red's Trust piece, the Ingenuity piece, the Luck piece and Brown's Perseverance piece), and Orange with 2 (their Leadership piece and Blue's Commitment piece). Season Finale 3 Prior to heading into the final Temple of Fate championship, Chris, Lindi, Demian and Nicole are awarded a new pyramid piece, Friendship (this will be introduced in the subsequent season premiere), to remember their experience in the jungles of the Wainiha Valley of Kauai. By nightfall, they depart the camp and take one last trek through the bamboo forest to the Temple of Fate‚Äî in the championship, the Gray team wins all 12 pyramid pieces in five rounds, becoming the champions of Endurance: Hawaii, alongside earning a vacation endorsed by Lindblad Expeditions to the Gal√°pagos Islands. Galapagos Special The champions of Endurance: Hawaii, Chris Vanderweir and Lindi Oest, enjoy their expedition to the Gal√°pagos Islands, where they meet some of the rarest creatures on the globe, and see the world's loneliest animal, a turtle by the name of Lonesome George.

They all compete except for Shea Thomas and Amelia \\"Georgia\\" Land, who become the Blue Team after speaking up for whom they wanted as their partners. In the end Christopher Tavarez wins and chooses Callie Simpkins as his partner, forming the Yellow Team. They choose the remaining teams: Franke Sisto and Erika Cook become the Red Team, Jonathan Lebowitz and Daniella Bustamante become the Purple Team (even though Daniella wanted to be paired with Michael Delvecchio), John Kardian and Julie Dubela become the Gray Team, and Michael and Kylie Glessman become the Orange Team, leaving Isaac Hainley and Jeszie Geronimo as the Green Team. After the teams choose their Pyramid Pieces, Courage (Blue), Trust (Yellow), Heart (Red), Perseverance (Purple), Commitment (Gray), Knowledge (Orange), and Leadership (Green), as well as the announcing of the Grand Prize- a trip to Costa Rica, the game officially begins. Blocked The teams face their first Endurance mission: they have to hold blocks between one another as they go down a lane, picking up more blocks. The only drawback is that if the blocks are dropped, the team has to pick them up before continuing on. The first team back with all of their blocks wins the Teamwork piece and control of the Samadhi. In the end, the Green team wins, putting them in the lead with two Pyramid Pieces, and they decide to handicap their friends on the Gray Team, after learning that Gray has a strong friendship with Blue. The Gray Team ends up getting handicapped with four sandbags. Raft Pull The teams face their first elimination and everyone's eyes are set on Gray and Blue because of their strong friendship. The teams have to pile sandbags on another team's colored triangle for 30 seconds before loading sandbags they've been given onto their raft. The teams must then pull their rafts to the other side of the lake and grab their team flag. The first team to make it back and mount their flag onto their colored triangle wins the opportunity to send two teams to the Temple of Fate. Because they got the Samadhi, the Gray Team is given four additional sandbags to start with. Gray and Blue end up with the most sandbags and the Purple Team mounts their flag one second before the Red Team and wins the Temple Mission, and as expected, Gray and Blue are sent to the temple. In the end, the Curse of the Gray Team strikes again and the Gray Team is sent home first for the third time in Endurance history, and the Blue Team is given a warm welcome-back from the other five teams. Drop Out Following the Gray Team's elimination, they give their Commitment piece to the Blue Team as a sign of a true friendship, putting Blue and Green in a tie for first place. The teams are faced with their next mission: hanging onto a bar suspended a couple of inches over the water (their feet on one end and their hands on the other) for as long as they can. The last one standing wins their team the Discipline piece and the power to choose two opposing teams that will form their Super Team in tomorrow's Temple Mission. In a shocking development, Erika outlasts all of the guys, winning the challenge for the Red Team and putting them in first place with Green and Blue. In the end, they end up choosing Green and Yellow as part of their Super Team, leaving Purple, Orange, and Blue, the \\"underdog teams\\", to face their opponents in the next temple mission. Super Stumped In today's Temple Mission, it's Red, Yellow, and Green vs. Orange, Blue, and Purple in the Super Team Temple Mission. The contestants have to use two planks to make a bridge to their team flag, and then build another bridge back to shore. The winning Super Team gets to send two of the three teams on the opposing Super Team to the Temple of Fate. After the Red/Green/Yellow Super Team stacks one of their planks on the end of the other, making them jump into the water so Erika can move it, the Purple/Orange/Blue Super Team manages to snag a victory, making this their first (and only) win for Orange and Blue. Even though Jonathan was unsure on whom to send (because Purple is in an alliance with Green and Yellow), the winning Super Team ultimately decides to send Red and Yellow to the Temple, where Yellow becomes the second team to be eliminated from the competition. This also starts a history of the Yellow Team never making it past 6th place. The Halfway Point This was a special recap episode, which recapped the events of the season up until now. A sneak preview of the remaining eight episodes is shown at the end. Waterworks Following the Yellow Team's elimination, the Green Team reads a note from them, saying that they are giving their Trust piece to the Red Team, putting them in the lead, while Green and Blue remain in second place, each with two pieces. The five remaining teams have to take a piece of canvas and fill it with water, which they must dump into their team-colored barrel, and repeat the process until one team's barrel is filled to the rim with water, which will shoot out the top of the barrel. The winning team gets the Luck piece, and, as usual, the Samadhi. But there's a catch: the losing team will be given a one-way ticket to the Temple of Fate, unless they win the next Temple Mission. In the end, the Green Team wins, putting them in first place with Red, who receives the Samadhi, which contains a ten-foot rope, and the Purple Team ends up finishing last, putting them in great danger. The Return of Fireball In a very unusual episode of Endurance: Tehachapi, J.D. and Daniella, who is the ultimate Endurance fan, reveal that they went online and asked the fans about choosing a past Temple Mission to appear again. The winner? Fireball. Because they got the Samadhi, the Red Team's raft is placed ten feet further away from shore. In the end, the Green Team wins, and they send Purple (because they lost and thus, were automatically sent to the temple) and Orange (because the other teams saw them as a threat after eliminating Purple from the Temple Mission) to the Temple of Fate. In the end, the Orange Team becomes the third team to be eliminated from the competition. Hang 5 In the opening, the Red Team reads the Orange Team's farewell note and end up receiving their Knowledge piece, putting them in the lead with four pieces, Green is in second with three pieces, Blue in third with two, and Purple in last with only one. The four remaining teams compete for the Strength piece in the next mission, where one team member holds onto a bar suspended over the water while their partner sits on top and moves their partner across. The team member hanging onto the bar has to transport five team-colored triangles back to the other side, one at a time. The first place team receives the Strength piece and, once again, control over the Samadhi. In the end, the Green Team wins, continuing their legendary winning streak, and then argue fiercely over who should get the Samadhi. In the end, Erika tells Jeszie to give the Smadhi to the Red Team, which ends up happening. Franke breaks it open and inside, the Red Team discovers a drawing of a clock with both hands pointing to the number 60. Cubed In the second-to-last Temple Mission, the teams have to assemble a team-colored cube before the other teams do, making this a mental challenge. Because they got the Samadhi, the Red Team is forced to sit out for one minute before starting, but they never get the chance, because, in a shocking development, the Purple Team wins in 51 seconds. When announcing who they are sending to the Temple of Fate, Purple spares the Green Team because of their still-going alliance, sending Red and Blue to the Temple each a second time. In the end, the Red Team wins and is locked into the Final 3, while the Blue Team leaves the competition. Create Your Own Game 2 As the Blue team leaves their Courage and Commitment pieces to the Green Team, putting them in the lead with six Pyramid Pieces (the Red Team is in second with four pieces, while the Purple Team still has only one), the \\"Create Your Own Game\\" challenge returns to the show as the second-to-last mission this season. The Final 3 design a 3-legged race type of game, where the teams, with their ankles tied together, have to knock down 5 team-colored cubes off a barrel at the same time, before grabbing three blocks and making their way through the rope obstacle course. Once that's done with, the blocks have to be balanced on a cylinder all the way back to the starting line. The winner gets the Samadhi and the Ingenuity piece. In the end, the Purple Team wins their first and only Endurance mission and are put onto the board with two pieces and they give the Samadhi to the Green Team, who discover two ten-pound weights hidden inside. Circle of Trust In the final Endurance 4 Temple Mission, the teams have to hang on to a square-shaped bar while being held up by bungee chords. The last team hanging on to each other gets a spot in the Final 2 while the losing two teams go to the Temple of Fate. In the end, Erika proves her strength yet again by winning the challenge for the Red Team, sending Purple and Green to the temple (the second time Purple has visited the temple). Sadly in the end, the Green Team is eliminated and the Purple Team is locked into the Final 2. Spin Fly In the final Endurance 4 Mission, the Red and Purple teams must compete for the Friendship piece, and the six pieces that the Green Team left behind: Leadership, Teamwork, Courage, Commitment, Strength, and Luck. Red and Purple create memorials for their previously departed teammates/friends and competes in their final mission: one team member from each team is suspended from a beam and has throw sandbags onto one of the pieces in order to claim it. The other teammates have to run in a circle to give their partners momentum before joining in the game. Purple ends up getting four, while Red ends up getting three. The mission puts Red in the lead with seven (their Heart piece, the Discipline piece, Yellow's Trust piece, Orange's Knowledge piece, the Luck piece, Blue's Courage piece, and the Teamwork piece) and Purple in second with six (their Perseverance piece, the Ingenuity piece, Green's Leadership piece, the Friendship piece, the Strength piece, and Gray's Commitment piece). In the end, the teams prepare to head to their final challenge in the Temple of Fate and J.D. presents a preview of the finale. Finale 4 Before going into the final challenge at the Temple of Fate, Franke, Jonathan, Daniella, and Erika are each given a log with the season's artwork etched onto one side as a reminder of what the four accomplished in the game. After making their last confessionals and talking about how they would miss the mountains, they head to the Temple for the finale challenge, which, as usual, involves putting the Pyramid Pieces earned in the game in front of a silver pyramid (the number of pyramids increases by one each round) and the team with the gold pyramid gets all of the pieces on the table. The game keeps going until one team has won all thirteen pieces. In the end, the Red Team, Franke and Erika, after six tormenting rounds, become the Endurance: Tehachapi champions, winning the grand prize trip to Costa Rica for an eight-day trip, where they help researchers track the endangered sea turtle, and get up close and personal with rain forest creatures from an observation deck 100 feet high up in the air. Best of Endurance: Tehachapi J.D. recaps the entire fourth season of Endurance. Top 10 Games J.D. reveals the top 10 missions of the first four seasons, as selected by the viewers on the official Discovery Kids website.  Endurance Season Five - High Sierras: 2006‚Äì2007  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background: White;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom: 3px solid #6B8E23;\\" ! # !! Title !! Original Air Date } = Episode description =  Balance is the Key  20 all new contestants arrive at Shaver Lake, deep within the High Sierras, where the fifth season of Endurance takes place. After spending a night with one another, J.D. reveals that one boy and one girl will be chosen from among both sexes to skip the Right to Stay Challenge‚Äî shockingly, that same person will choose one more contestant to skip the challenge as well! In the end, the girls select Darci Miller and Kelsey Schultz to take the free pass, whereas the boys select Aric Manthey and Alex Carignan. In the Right to Stay Challenge, each contestant must traverse a balance beam, trying to complete five laps as quickly as possible, with the last two girls and boys to finish being eliminated. Lilly Brown, Taylor Sico-McNulty, Kristine Turner and Cealey Godwin complete all their laps first, leaving Aeriel Miranda, Anna Nti-Asare, Martina Iwala and Stefanie Fernandez to vie for the last two spots in the next episode.  Hanging Around  Picking up where the girls' race in the Right to Stay Challenge left off, Aeriel and Anna claim the remaining two spots, whereas Martina and Stefanie are automatically eliminated. In the boys' race, Dakota Fisher, Garret Manno, Connor Finnegan, Max McFarland, Cameron Uranick and Ike Moody are the first complete all their laps, automatically eliminating Adrian Bardales and Rafael Liriano. The following day, the remaining 16 contestants discuss who they want as partners. Much drama ensues with Taylor's refusal to be paired with Garret, and some contestants even contemplate having them as a team to be an easy target. In the partner selection game, the last person holding on will win the right to choose the first team, although it's not going to be their own (to be continued in the next episode).  Unwind  Dakota wins the partner selection game, and picks Cameron and Aeriel to be the first team. They then select Dakota and Kelsey to be second team, who selects Alex and Cealey to be the third team, who selects Aric and Lilly to be the fourth team, who selects Max and Kristine to be the fifth team, who selects Connor and Darci to be the sixth team, who selects Ike and Taylor to be the seventh team, leaving Garret and Anna as the eighth and final team. As yet another added twist, J.D. reveals that the team that finishes in last place, without receiving a color, will be eliminated. In that challenge, each team must untangle themselves from a fence to claim a color. In the end, Garret and Anna finish last, and become the first team eliminated, although they can give the Triangle of Immunity (Friendship piece) to any team they want; the seven official teams are Alex and Cealey on the Green Team (piece is Commitment), Dakota and Kelsey on the Purple Team (piece is Teamwork), Cameron and Aeriel on the Red Team (piece is Knowledge), Aric and Lilly on the Yellow Team (piece is Trust), Ike and Taylor on the Blue Team (piece is Perseverance), Max and Kristine on the Orange Team (piece is Strength), and Connor and Darci on the Gray Team (piece is Luck). The grand prize trip is revealed to be a trip to Hawaii, and the game officially begins.  Hot Potato  Garret and Anna leave the Triangle of Immunity to the Purple Team, much to Aeriel's chagrin; the seven teams compete in their first Endurance Mission, with the Leadership piece and Samadhi on the line. However, this Samadhi is revealed to allow the winning team to switch two contestants from any two teams, even their own, although they can bestow that responsibility on another team. The challenge requires each team to transport water in bowl with two sticks through an obstacle course to a barrel on the far end, and the winner will be determined by one team's flag going up, indicating that they have enough water in their barrel. In the end, the Blue Team shocks everyone by winning, putting them in a tie for first place with Purple, although both members fear the ramifications of switching teams. Red and Green volunteer to switch, and Purple schemes to have Blue give control to the former, so that they can switch Blue and Gray! Ultimately, Taylor allows Cameron to have control over the switch as planned, and he switches Connor to Blue, and Ike to Gray, but has second thoughts (to be continued in the next episode).  Moving it Along  In the end, Cameron officially makes Connor and Taylor the new Blue Team, and Ike and Darci as the new Gray Team. In the second Endurance Mission, the teams must move from one end of a clearing to the other using only two blocks. If either player falls, they restart, and whoever reaches the finish line first wins the Discipline piece and Samadhi. In the end, the Blue Team wins their second mission, putting them in the lead with three pieces. Fearing retaliation from the Red-Purple-Green-Orange alliance, they handicap their former teammates. The Gray Team finds a clock inside, with the hand pointing to 4, indicating a 20-second penalty.  Walk the Plank  The teams face their first Temple Mission, which involves the girls standing at the end of planks held up with ropes by their partners. If they let go, their partner is dropped in the water, eliminating their team, and the last team holding on wins the opportunity to send two teams to the Temple of Fate. Despite Gray's best efforts, the Red Team wins and sends them along with Yellow to the Temple, but not before they bribe Connor to reveal Darci's strategy to Yellow. In the end, Yellow uses Darci's strategy against her, and Gray becomes the second team eliminated.  Fill & Spill  The Gray Team leaves their Luck piece to the Yellow Team (tying them for second place with Purple), while wishing that Taylor would \\"trade her tickets for Hawaii for a trip to Temple\\". In the third Endurance Mission, one player holds onto a bar as their partners dump water into any other team's barrel, and the last team holding on wins the Heart piece and the power to choose the SuperTeams.In the end, Max throws the challenge and allows Purple to win, tying them for first place with Blue. After much contention, Purple joins forces with Red and Orange for the next Temple Mission, whereas Green, Yellow and Blue make up the opposing SuperTeam.  Superboats  J.D. shockingly reveals that only one team from each SuperTeam would be allowed to participate in the challenge‚Äî ultimately, Purple and Blue represent their SuperTeams, with their challenge requiring them to use rafts to collect three flags, each of which is in their SuperTeam colors. In the end, the Purple/Red/Orange SuperTeam wins (second for Purple and Red, first and only for Orange), and Yellow and Blue are sent to the Temple, despite growing resentment of Purple and Green's alliance from the other teams. Yellow becomes the third team eliminated, finishing in 6th place for the second consecutive season.  Midseason Recap 5  A mid-season recap with a preview for the remaining six episodes.  It's a Drag  The Yellow Team gives their Trust and Luck pieces to the Blue Team, giving them the lead. J.D. then tells everyone that the next challenge is a Temple Mission, and the Purple-Green alliance seems to be on the rocks. In the challenge, the teams must haul a 150-lbs. barrel on a sled, using just three logs. The team that drags the barrel over the finish line first wins; in the end, the Green Team wins their first mission, and sends Blue and Orange to the Temple. Dakota helps Orange deceive Taylor about their strategy at Temple, but it fails, as they become the fourth team eliminated.  Create Your Own Game 3  The Orange Team gives their Strength piece to the Red Team, and for the third consecutive season, the teams will create their own game for the final Endurance Mission. The final four teams come up with a challenge that requires them to transport five balls using only a pair of bowls, them taking their respectively colored flag back to their starting point. The winning team gets the Ingenuity piece, and, as usual, the Samadhi. But there's a catch: the losing team will be given a one-way ticket to the Temple of Fate, unless they win the next Temple Mission. In the end, the Blue Team wins, and controversy ensues after Cealey accuses Taylor of cheating, which was really just an accident. Ultimately, they strategically handicap Purple, who discover a five-foot rope inside.  Fill 'er Up  In the second-to-last Temple Mission, each team must transport water with a holed pipe, hoping to force a flotation device out of their tube. In the end, Purple overcomes the Samadhi, and sends Blue and Red to the Temple (the Triangle of Immunity reverts to a regular pyramid piece as of this episode). At the Temple, Blue becomes the first team to survive three trips to the Temple of Fate, and Red becomes the fifth team eliminated.  All Tied Up  The Red Team gives their Knowledge piece to the Blue Team (putting them in the lead with seven pieces), and the Strength piece to the Green Team, and J.D. reveals that one team will have an advantage in the final Temple Mission. This will be determined by the five teams who had been eliminated already, and Blue earns the most votes, awarding them the advantage; in the final Temple Mission, each team must untangle a pair of tethered balls on a log. In the end, the Purple Team wins, automatically sending Green and Blue to the final Temple, and Blue becomes the last team eliminated.  Slingshot Alley  In the final mission of Endurance: High Sierras, the Green and Purple teams will compete for the Courage piece, alongside the seven pieces left behind the Blue Team: Perseverance, Leadership, Discipline, Trust, Luck, Ingenuity and Knowledge. Before that, they create memorials in honor of their previously departed friends/teammates using the multi-level treehouses they lived in this season. In the end, Green manages to earn five out of the eight pyramid pieces in contention, giving them seven (their Commitment piece, Orange's Strength piece, the Leadership piece, Yellow's Trust piece, Red's Knowledge piece, the Ingenuity piece and the Discipline piece) over Purple's six (their Teamwork piece, the Friendship piece, the Heart piece, Gray's Luck piece, the Courage piece and Blue's Perseverance piece) in the final competition.  Finale 5  Before they compete in the Final Temple of Fate, Alex, Cealey, Dakota and Kelsey are rewarded the Karma piece as a reminder of everything they've accomplished in the game (this will be introduced as a piece in the subsequent season premiere). In the end, the Green Team wins it all and becomes Endurance champions, winning the grand prize trip to Hawaii.  Best of Endurance: High Sierras  J.D. recaps the entire fifth season of Endurance.  Endurance Season Six - Fiji: 2007‚Äì2008  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background: White;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom: 3px solid #6B8E23;\\" ! # !! Title !! Original Air Date } = Episode description =  End of the Rope  16 new contestants arrive in Fiji to compete in the sixth season of Endurance, befriending each other before participating in the Right to Stay Challenge. This time around, the players must hold onto a rope over the ocean for as long as they can, and the first two boys and girls who fall will be automatically eliminated. In an emotional outcome, Andres Ramirez, Matthew Jones, Rebecca Simonoko and Cinnamon Aldridge are eliminated, allowing the remaining 12 contestants to continue onto the real competition.  Memory Race  The 12 remaining players prepare for the Partner Selection, although Briana Vega steadfastly refuses to be paired with Kyle Curtis, leading to some drama. In the challenge, the players must memorize a sequence of four colored coconuts, with only six racks. After six players take those racks, the ones who have gotten the sequence correct will repeat the process, and whoever has the most correct sequences wins. In the end, Connor Konz wins and partners up with Jackie Wei to become the Purple Team (piece is Leadership). Afterward, they choose Leslie Powell and Will Cuddy as the Green Team (piece is Friendship), Caleb Courtney and Lauren Dixon as the Orange Team (piece is Courage), Hannah Gross and Jonathan Young as the Red Team (piece is Heart), Ben Scheuer and Jordyn Barbato as the Blue Team (piece is Strength), leaving Briana and Kyle as the Yellow Team (piece is Perseverance). Yellow soon finds themselves ostracized from the rest of the group, and after the grand prize trip is revealed as a trip to Australia, the game officially begins.  Mana Kisi  The teams face their first mission: transporting sixty pegs from one side of the sandbar to the other, hoping to win the Magic Box. In the end, the Green Team wins, and J.D. reveals that the Magic Box contains one free round for them, in the event that they are sent to the Temple of Fate‚Äî as another advantage, they can tell the rest of the group whatever they want about it! Ultimately, Green lies about their prize being immunity from getting sent the first Temple of Fate. Meanwhile, Orange and Green form a secret alliance with the goal of controlling the game and making the final two, and at the end of the episode, J.D. visits to unveil a new twist (to be revealed in the next episode).  Blind Faith  Continuing from the last episode, J.D. reveals that the teams can vote to give one team they think deserves an advantage in the game. The next morning, the Blue Team is unanimously voted to receive the advantage, and it's revealed to be the Luck pyramid piece, putting them in the lead with two pieces. Green and Orange decide on adding Red to their alliance, and the teams compete in an Endurance Mission, where the girls must direct their blindfolded partners to complete a three-piece puzzle. The first team to finish the puzzle wins the Trust pyramid piece and control of the Samadhi; in the end, the Orange Team wins, tying them for the lead with Blue. However, when it's time to give the Samadhi out, J.D. grants Orange the option to swap the Samadhi for the opportunity to send one team to the Temple of Fate! Ultimately, Orange shockingly decided to send a team to Temple, which ended up being the Yellow Team.  Box Launch  With Yellow already bound for Temple, the teams face off in their first Temple Mission to decide who will join them there. Despite the Purple Team's best efforts, the Red Team wins and sends them with Yellow to the Temple of Fate. In the end, Yellow becomes the first team to be eliminated, finishing in 6th place for the third consecutive season.  Alliances Uncovered  Yellow leaves their Perseverance piece to Red, creating a three-way tie between them, Blue and Orange. In the second Endurance Mission, the teams must pass along six fishes, then paddle their rafts to the shore, with the first team to do so winning the Teamwork pyramid piece and control of the Samadhi. Despite Orange's best efforts, Green wins, creating a four-way tie for first place with two pieces, and Caleb copes with his father's potential disappointment in his loss during the mission. In the end, Green gives Purple the Samadhi, which is revealed to be 20 pounds of extra weight.  Weight an Hour  Jackie becomes enraged over being handicapped by the Samadhi, vowing revenge on the Green and Orange Teams if she wins. In the second Temple Mission, the teams must tip a scale using items scattered across the beach, and despite Purple's efforts to help Blue win, Orange wins and sends them both to the Temple of Fate. In the end, Purple becomes the second team to be eliminated.  Midseason Recap 6  A mid-season recap with a preview for the remaining five episodes.  Island Hopping  Purple leaves their Leadership piece to Blue, putting them in the lead once more with three pieces. In the third Endurance Mission, the boys must shoot cannonballs to their partners to clear three different levels, with the winner receiving the Commitment and Discipline pyramid pieces, as well as control of the Samadhi. In the end, Green wins, putting them in the lead with four pieces, while Red's communication breakdown leads to aN argument after the mission. Ultimately, Green gives Red the Samadhi, which reveals that only one member can play the next Temple Mission, who ends up being Jonathan.  3 to Go/Shark Bait  Hannah feels betrayed by the Green-Orange alliance, and vows to send them if she wins. In the double Temple Mission, one member of each team competes in a mental game, while their partner competes in a physical game. For the mental game, Ben, Lauren and Leslie must match trios of the names of Endurance pyramid pieces, and whoever clears their board first wins control of one team going to the Temple of Fate. In the end, Blue wins and sends Orange. For the physical game, Caleb, Jonathan, Jordyn and Will must stay atop a ring as long as possible, with whomever lasting the longest winning control over the other team going to Temple. In the end, Red overcomes the Samadhi and sends Green. At the Temple, Green reveals the truth behind the Magic Box to Orange, and Orange becomes the third team to be eliminated.  Stand Bags  Orange exposes Green's secret about the Magic Box, and leaves their Courage piece to them and the Trust piece to Red. In the final Temple Mission, the teams must gather enough sandbags to reach their respectively colored flags without jumping. Whoever finishes first receives only one teavee nut in their color, with the second-place team receiving five nuts and the third-place team receiving ten nuts. In the end, Red wins, while Green comes in second and Blue comes in third. Later on, two nuts are drawn, with Blue and Red shockingly being revealed as the teams going to the final Temple of Fate. In the end, Red becomes the fourth and last team eliminated, despite winning the Temple Mission.  Ultimate Finale (part 1)  In a vote decided by the four eliminated teams, Blue is awarded the Karma pyramid piece, giving them four pieces going into the championship. In the final Endurance: Fiji mission, the Blue and Green teams must compete for the three pieces left behind by Red (Heart, Perseverance and Trust), and the two pieces still in play (Knowledge and Ingenuity). After decorating their huts' dock in memory of their fallen contestants/friends and their time spent on the island, the teams compete in a scavenger hunt for the last five pyramid pieces. Green picks up the Knowledge, Heart and Ingenuity pieces, and Blue finds two clues (to be continued in the finale).  Ultimate Finale (part 2)  Blue obtains the last two pieces, officially putting them at six (their Strength piece, the Luck piece, Purple's Leadership piece, the Karma piece, Yellow's Perseverance piece and the Trust piece) to Green's eight (their Friendship piece, the Teamwork piece, the Commitment piece, the Discipline piece, Orange's Courage piece, the Knowledge piece, Red's Heart piece and the Ingenuity piece) going into the final competition. Before they exit the camp for the last time, Ben, Jordyn, Leslie and Will are rewarded shell necklaces blessed by the priest, and in the end, the Blue Team wins it all and becomes Endurance Champions, winning the grand prize trip to Australia.  Best of Endurance: Fiji  J.D. recaps the entire sixth season of Endurance.  J.D.'s Greatest Twists  J.D. counts down the best five twists in Endurance history.

Similar to the Sicilian Mafia, the group shares features of omert√†, ethnicity, and patronage. It is believed the resentment of competing interests led to the creation of the acerbic idea of a clique gaining headway through its closeness to power and thereby approximating resources of the state under the banner of capitalism. Usage of the term Mafia The term Kaduna Mafia was supposedly popularised by journalist, Mvendaga Jibo. History =Context= The challenges to Ahmadu Bello of the transition from colonial rule to self- government laid in his role as a member of the traditional ruling establishment. He was confronted with either maintaining the caliphal structures under British rule or modernise administrative structures of the traditional institutions to provide them with power of utility. It is argued that the introduction of reforms of the institutions saved them from withering away. Traditional authority has continued to play a central role in Northern society since the time of Ahmadu Bello, despite continuing reforms. The creation of the civil service during the period of Ahmadu Bello is one of his major achievements. He regarded the northern civil service as a meritocracy, which should be above petty political quarrels, and certainly above corruption. The civil service had a rigorous code of ethics, and came to serve as a counterbalance to both politicians and traditional leaders. The trans- ethnic nature of the civil service provided the backbone for Northern Regionalism and for northern development efforts, which were based on the principle of equal distribution of opportunities. The technical and administrative skills of the civil service were essential to a large-scale political community, and the willingness to take assignments outside of the capital city was part of the ethos. The civil service provided a smooth transition from colonial rule to Independence, and an equally smooth transition from Northern Regionalism to the creation of states and the consolidation of Nigerian federalism. Perhaps the key to the effective functioning of the civil service was its apparent balance in terms of sub- regional zones, its transcendence of sub-regional interests, and its ability to incorporate intergenerational cohorts into a cohesive whole. His insistence that the next generation of traditional leaders be western educated set the stage for the transition to their subsequent roles. The first generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the decade from about 1910‚Äì1920: Tafawa Balewa, Yahya Madawaki, Isa Kaita, Abubakar Imam) tended to be cohorts from Katsina College, and had good personal relationships with their colleagues (including Ahmadu Bello) who had gone into political life. The second generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born from 1920‚Äì1930, and reaching senior status in the service during the transition to independence such as ‚Äì Mohammed Bello, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu, Hassan Katsina) tended to have familial connections and were also part of the Katsina-Kaduna- Zaria education axis, they had close working relations with their ‚Äúseniors‚Äù (the first generation) in the civil service and in the political realm. The third generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born from 1930‚Äì1940 and entering the senior service after independence) tended to have overseas educational experience, and there was often a sharp difference in perspective from those in the first and second generations. This generation of Northerners went on to form the core of the Kaduna Mafia. =Origins= The origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the fall of the First Republic. The assassination of Ahmadu Bello and other northern leaders prodded a group of young northerners to rally around and oppose the military government of General Aguiyi Ironsi. This group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly Muslim and based in Kaduna. It is important to note that a dichotomy exists between the traditional ruling establishment and the mafia, despite an interconnection. This group was educated mostly in the United Kingdom, and had connections with the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. They were known for their intelligence, commitment to the traditional values and socio-political interests of Northern Nigeria and their internal camaraderie. Following the rise of the Second Republic members became involved in varied aspects of the Nigerian nation, they were bank directors, cabinet members, military colonels and owners of business; their main differentiating symbol metamorphosed into the prominence of economic interest as a driving factor in their activities. =Military era= The group supposedly achieved most success during the military regime of General Obasanjo, where many of its members were appointed to key positions of power and used its alliance to obtain patronage and disburse favour to friends and associates. =Democratic era= The group returned to prominence during the administration of President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua. And later in 2015, during the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.

It is an autoimmune disease. Signs and symptoms Three types of juvenile arthritis exist‚Äîjuvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), of which JRA is the most common. JRA again can be divided into three main forms: The classification is based upon symptoms, number of joints involved and the presence of certain antibodies in the blood. #Polyarticular arthritis is the first type of arthritis, which affects about 30‚Äì40% of children with arthritis and is more common in girls than boys. Typically five or more joints are affected (usually smaller joints such as the hands and feet but many also affect the hips, neck, shoulders and jaw). #Oligoarticular (aka pauciarticular) arthritis can be early or late onset and is the second type of arthritis, affecting about 50% of children with juvenile arthritis. This type affects fewer than four joints (usually the large joints such as knees, ankles or wrists) and may cause eye inflammation in girls with positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). Girls younger than eight are more likely to develop this type of arthritis. #Systemic disease is the least common form, with 10‚Äì20% of children (boys and girls equally) being affected with limited movement, swelling and pain in at least one joint. A common symptom of this type is a high, spiking fever of or higher, lasting for weeks or months, and a rash of pale red spots on the chest, thighs or other parts of the body may be visible. Cause In most cases, juvenile arthritis is caused by the body attacking its own healthy cells and tissues, i.e. autoimmunity, causing the joint to become inflamed and stiff. Once the joint has become inflamed and stiff, damage is done to the joint and the growth of the joint may by changed or impaired. Diagnosis Early diagnosis and treatment by a paediatric rheumatologist or a rheumatologist can help manage inflammation, relieve pain, and prevent joint damage. Careful examination, laboratory tests (blood and urine), and various forms of imaging like X-rays may be some of the tests conducted by a doctor. =Definition= Juvenile arthritis, also known as Childhood arthritis (JA) is any form of chronic arthritis or arthritis-related conditions which affects individuals under the age of 16. Juvenile arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease. Treatment The treatment of juvenile arthritis includes medications, physical therapy, splints and in severe cases surgery. Methotrexate is commonly prescribed to children with juvenile arthritis. These treatments are focused on reducing swelling, relieving pain and maintaining full movement of joints. Children are encouraged to be involved in extra-curricular activities, physical activity when possible, and to live a \\"normal\\" life. Epidemiology In the US it affects about 250,000-294,000 children making it one of the most common childhood diseases.

The thick deposits were accumulated from 125,000 years ago. Around 75,000 years ago, during cave remodelling, the stratigraphic sediments were moved out into external middens. In 2015, the South African government submitted a proposal to add the caves to the list of World Heritage Sites. From 1960, Ronald Singer, Ray Inskeep, John Wymer, Hilary Deacon, Richard Klein and others suggested the excavation yielded the earliest known evidence of behaviourally modern humans. Further analysis suggested that the specimens fall \\"outside the range of modern variation\\". Morphology Analysis of 14 proximal ulnar dimensions compared to morphological properties of African archaic humans, and Levantine Mousterian, archaic European humans, west Asian and, European Upper Paleolithic, African Epipaleolithic and recent modern human also of recent African descent suggests an archaic total morphological pattern for the KRM specimens. \\"MSA-associated humans from KRM may not be as modern as has been claimed from the craniofacial material\\". The hominin specimens include cranial fragments, mandibles with teeth, and a few postcranial remains: ulna and five metatarsal bones.  Evidence for behavioural modernity  There is a thick accumulation of deposits, both inside the caves and outside against the cliff face, proving that Klasies River Mouth people knew how to hunt small game, fish (later), gather plants and roots, cook by roasting on hearths, and manage their land (later). There is extensive evidence of shellfish collecting; MSA stone artifact technology; gathering plants, roots and flowers for food; cooking plants, corms, seal, penguins, and antelope meat on hearths with fire; general organisation of the settlement; and land/veld management by fire. The evidence also appears to indicate that their presence was seasonal or migratory. There is also evidence of cannibalism, charred and carved 'modern human' bones discarded with other food remnants. While Middle Stone Age (MSA) assemblage associated with those people are described as anatomically modern, there is ongoing debate about when they were also behaviourally modern. There is a marked difference between the Paleolithic stone technology used in the earliest layers from 125,000 years ago, and the superior MST blades of the 70,000-year-old Howiesons Poort period that used raw material which had been 'mined' 20 kilometres inland. There is also a differentiation between the Paleolithic food detritus that accumulated underfoot inside the caves 125,000 years ago and the ejection of such detritus from the cave into external middens by the occupants of ca. 75,000 years ago, suggesting the development of rudimentary \\"housekeeping\\" by that time. Discovery and excavation The artifacts and bones were originally reported by Paul Haslem and Ludwig Abel, then in 1960 Ray Inskeep and Ronald Singer identified the artifacts as Middle Stone Age. In 1967 and 1968 Ronald Singer and John Wymer started extensive excavations, with their initial findings published in 1972 by the University of Chicago Press. Since 1984 research has been continued by Hilary Deacon. The site is now protected by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA), and the Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism.

Educated in Spain, at the University of Seville, Azcu√©naga began his military career in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata and became a member of the Primera Junta, the first autonomous government of modern Argentina. He was shortly exiled because of his support to the minister Mariano Moreno, and returned to Buenos Aires when the First Triumvirate replaced the Junta. He held several offices since then, most notably being the first Governor intendant of Buenos Aires after the May Revolution. He died at his country house (the modern Quinta de Olivos) in 1833. Biography =Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata= Miguel de Azcu√©naga was born in Buenos Aires on June 4, 1754. He was the son of Vicente de Azcu√©naga Iturbe, a Spanish businessman from Biscay, and Mar√≠a Rosa de Basavilbaso y Urtubia, from Buenos Aires. The Azcu√©naga-Basavilbaso had 4 sons and 3 daughters. Miguel de Azcu√©naga was sent to Spain at an early age, to complete his elementary studies in M√°laga and then attend the University of Seville. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1774, and made a new journey to Spain to oversee the business of his father.National..., p. 67 He began his military career in the artillery of Buenos Aires, during the Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese War, staying in that unit until the signing of the First Treaty of San Ildefonso that incorporated the Banda Oriental to the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. With the war concluded, he became a regidor of the Buenos Aires Cabildo. He took the arms again in 1778, during an attack of the natives, and directed the operations at the fort in San Miguel del Monte. As Spain fought the American Revolutionary War, it was feared that Britain may launch a counteroffensive against the Spanish colonies. Azcu√©naga led an artillery unit with 4 cannons in 1781, but no British attack took place.National..., pp. 67‚Äì68 He was appointed to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain was used as a model.Johnson, p. 99 He promoted the pavement of the streets, and the improvement of the buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicol√°s Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island for this work. He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.National..., p. 68 He was appointed lieutenant colonel in 1796, leading a local militia from that year to 1802. When he left, he granted all his military wages from that period to the soldiers of his unit. He was appointed colonel on March 24, 1802, and donated $2,435 for the clothing of the soldiers. He further donated $1,000,000 to build a navy, along with Juan Larrea and Domingo Matheu. He fought in the 1806 British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, leading a resistance in the G√°lvez bridge. He stood for 20 hours, with only 400 soldiers, against an overwhelming British force. He managed to escape with 50 soldiers, and aided the brigadier Hilari√≥n de la Quintana.National..., pp. 68‚Äì69 =Argentine War of Independence= Lithograph of the members of the Primera Junta The Peninsular War in Spain, along with the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and the fall of the Junta of Seville, escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcu√©naga attended it, and voted for the creation of a Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. Azcu√©naga lend his house to their secret meetings.L√≥pez, p. 75 Azcu√©naga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta, and promoted to brigadier.National..., pp. 69‚Äì70 The reasons of Azcu√©naga's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy; besides being from the armed forces, Azcu√©naga had close ties with the rich people of the city.Luna, p. 39Scenna, pp. 43‚Äì47 The Junta suffered from internal conflicts between the conservatives (led by Cornelio Saavedra) and the liberals (led by Mariano Moreno). Azcu√©naga was aligned with Moreno. Although he opposed the expansion of the Junta into the Junta Grande, he voted for the proposal, perhaps under pressure of Saavedra.Galasso, p. 113 Mariano Moreno resigned in December, and all his supporters were forced to resign in May 1811. Azcu√©naga was exiled to the Mendoza Province, and lost his military rank. His wife requested instead an exile to the closer Luj√°n, which was declined. The Junta was replaced by the First Triumvirate. Azcu√©naga still had a positive image among his peers, and the political change allowed his return and the restitution of his rank. However, a mistake with the documentation gave him only the rank of colonel; he could only retrieve his rank of Brigadier in 1814. He was appointed Governor intendant of Buenos Aires (ruling over the province, whereas the Triumvirate had a national authority).National..., p. 70 The Assembly of the Year XIII replaced the Triumvirate with a unipersonal head of state, the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. Gervasio Antonio de Posadas was appointed Supreme Director, and Azcu√©naga selected as one of his five advisors. In 1816 the Cabildo appointed him as protector of the freedom of the press. He became a member of the Congress of Tucum√°n in 1818, when it was moved from San Miguel de Tucum√°n to Buenos Aires. He was elected vice-president of the Congress in September and reelected in May 1819.National..., pp. 70‚Äì71 The defeat of Buenos Aires in 1820 at the Battle of Cepeda, part of the Argentine Civil Wars, led to the closing of the Congress.Abad de Santill√°n, pp. 89‚Äì91 Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, Azcu√©naga was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu√©naga, Antonio Gonz√°lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos√© Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Bartolom√© Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo Jos√© de Urquiza; Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge, but whether that lodge was truly masonic has been debated: =Later life= Cenotaph of Azcu√©naga at the La Recoleta Cemetery In 1828, aged 74, he took part in the peace negotiations with the Empire of Brazil after the end of the Argentine-Brazilian War, which led to the creation of the state of Uruguay. Those negotiations took place in Montevideo. He managed the economy in 1829 and 1830, and became a deputy in 1831 and 1832. His fellow deputies pointed that he attended all the legislative sessions, despite of his old age.National..., p. 72 Azcu√©naga died at his home on December 19, 1833. The governor Juan Jos√© Viamonte ordered the construction of a cenotaph at the Northern Cemetery (modern La Recoleta Cemetery), which is still in place today. The official decree stated that \\"the noteworthy services he gave to the nation at all times the brigadier general Miguel de Azcu√©naga, and particularly in the days of the glorious independence, require a demonstration that takes to posterity the name of this patriot, and keeps the memory of his civic virtues\\".National..., pp. 72‚Äì73 Azcu√©naga's country house was built during the establishment of Buenos Aires in 1580 by Juan de Garay. After several generations it was inherited by Justa Rufina Basavilbaso, Azcu√©naga's wife. Further generations of the family (with ancestry of the viceroy Antonio de Olaguer y Feli√∫ as well) inherited it, until Carlos Villate Olaguer gave it to the Argentine state in 1913, to be used as an official residence of the President of Argentina. It was renamed as Quinta de Olivos, and it was used by all Argentine presidents since Agust√≠n Pedro Justo.

History  The formation of the Mill Creek Community School Corporation is the result of the 1964 consolidation of Clay, Franklin, and Liberty Township schools. Until that time, there was a friendly but heated rivalry that existed among the Amo, Clayton, and Stilesville High Schools. The consolidation of the township schools located in Amo, Belleville, Cartersburg, Clayton, Coatsville, Hazelwood, and Stilesville produced a higher quality education system, but also resulted in a loss of the history that was a significant part of the former schools and their associated towns. When first consolidated, elementary schools in Amo, Clayton, Hazelwood, and Stilesville were organized. Cascade High School (incorporating the first letters of all three communities, Clayton, Amo, and Stilesville in the name) was also opened at that time. Eventually, Hazelwood and Stilesville elementary schools were closed, and Cascade Junior High School was opened next door to the high school.

Its last assignment was with United States Air Forces in Europe at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, where it was inactivated on 5 July 2006. The wing was first established during World War II as the 5th Photographic Group with Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations. The 26th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing operated under the direction of Strategic Air Command from 1952 until 1958. The two units were consolidated in 1965 as the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and served for the next twenty- six years with United States Air Forces Europe. The wing was inactivated on 31 July 1991. The wing was activated again as the 26th Intelligence Wing in late 1991. History =World War II= F-5E Lightning The wing's first predecessor was activated in July 1942 as the 5th Photographic Group at what would become Peterson Field, Colorado with the 21st, 22d, 23d and 24th Photographic Mapping Squadrons assigned, although neither the group nor any of its squadrons would become operational until January 1943.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 111‚Äì112Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 117Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 123‚Äì134Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 126‚Äì127 However, by the time the group moved overseas in August 1943, only the 23d and 24th Squadrons remained assigned. After training in the United States and participating in military exercises, the group moved to Tunisia and served in combat with Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. The unit operated primarily with Lockheed F-5 Lightnings, ranging as far as Germany and Poland. It also flew night photographic missions with its Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress and North American B-25D Mitchell aircraft. The 5th Group provided photographic coverage for landing areas for Operation Shingle, the Allied landings at Anzio. The unit provided road and rail target reconnaissance for the United States Fifth Army and British Eighth Army and performed bomb damage assessment photography to measure the success of allied bombing. It flew missions to northwestern France to photograph rail targets to be attacked in preparation for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Closer to home, it performed similar missions for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August. The group earned a Distinguished Unit Citation in September when it secured intelligence of Luftwaffe installations in the Balkans that enabled fighter aircraft to destroy large numbers of Luftwaffe fighters and transports. The group remained in Italy after VE Day until October 1945, when it returned to the United States and was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation. =Strategic Air Command= B-47E from Lockbourne AFB at Pima Air Museum In May 1952 the 26th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was activated under Strategic Air Command as one of two Boeing B-47 Stratojet wings at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, but was not fully manned until January 1953. The wing performed strategic reconnaissance and air refueling missions. The wing became non-operational in April 1958 and was inactivated in July. =Tactical Reconnaissance in Europe= The 5th Group and 26th Wing were consolidated in 1965 as the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and served for the next twenty-six years with United States Air Forces Europe. Exercising control of a deployed Aerospace Defense Command squadron, it also performed electronic countermeasure training through the late 1960s. From 1968 to 1973, it added an air defense responsibility. It performed day and night visual and photographic reconnaissance. From the fall of 1972 to spring of 1973 the wing also had a special operations mission. With the end of the Cold War in 1990, the wing was gradually phased down. In addition, the 1960s-era McDonnell RF-4C Phantoms were increasingly costing more and more to maintain. Tactical reconnaissance was being handled by other means, and the need for the wing was becoming less critical to USAFE planners. As a result, the RF-4Cs of the wing were sent to AMARC on 1 April 1991 and the wing's remaining tactical squadron was inactivated. The wing was inactivated on 31 July 1991. =Intelligence operations= The 26th Intelligence Wing was activated in October. It was renamed the 26th Information Operations Wing in 2000 and inactivated in 2006.

Description Thick-lipped gouramis can reach a length of TL. They are sexually dimorphic, with the female being silvery, but the male marked with oblique thin red and blue stripes along its flanks. Distribution This fish is a freshwater species native to south Myanmar. It has also been introduced into Colombia. Reproduction Like most other gouramis, the thick-lipped gourami builds a bubble nest into which the eggs are placed. The male guards the eggs but ignores the fry. In the aquarium The thick-lipped gourami has been widely transported around the world for the aquarium fish industry. It is a generally peaceful fish for a tropical community aquarium. Like other Trichogaster species, it tends to be a bit shy and hides under plant life when it feels threatened. They eat a variety of foods including flake foods, bloodworms, and brine shrimp. Aquarists avoid keeping these fish with barbs or other fin-nippers who may damage their thread-like ventral fins. T. labiosa are known to breed well. The male builds bubble nests and is not as likely as other species to bully the female if the female is not yet ready to spawn. The thick-lipped gourami has been deliberately crossbred with the banded gourami and the dwarf gourami to produce hybrids with new color patterns; these colors include gold, red, and green.

It was built in 1899 to serve the Endion neighborhood but was relocated to Canal Park in 1986 to make way for expansion of Interstate 35. Passenger service through the station had ceased in 1961 and freight service in 1978. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 under the name Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Depot (Endion) for its local significance in the themes of architecture and transportation. It was nominated for its status as one of Duluth's few surviving small passenger depots and as a seminal work of local architect I. Vernon Hill. History The Duluth and Iron Range Railroad (later the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway) began transporting passengers between Duluth and Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1886. The railroad was an essential link between small communities on the North Shore of Lake Superior. The line's first stop outside of downtown Duluth was at Endion. Endion was originally an independent town north of Duluth, but by the end of the nineteenth century it had been absorbed by the growing city. In 1899 the railroad commissioned the architectural firm of Tenbusch & Hill to design a small passenger depot for the Endion station. The building was completed in 1899 at a cost of $10,000 (). It originally sat only from the shore of Lake Superior, at 1504 South Street. The depot's design called for a foundation and trim of Kettle River sandstone, red brick body, and slate roof. The depot's design is a variation on the Richardsonian Romanesque style popular in the 1880s and 1890s, marked by rounded arches, deeply recessed windows, and heavy stonework, However its small scale is less imposing than larger Richardsonian Romanesque buildings. In its heyday, the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range depot at Endion was a busy station. Six trains arrived and departed each day. Some took suburban residents to and from downtown Duluth for work. Others transported passengers and freight up the North Shore. The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range railroad service, including the vital Endion station depot, was critical in the growth of Duluth's East End. In the second half of the twentieth century, however, passenger rail service declined significantly. The last passenger train left Endion station on July 15, 1961. The railroad continued to use the depot for freight service until 1978. Reuse and preservation The Endion station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. By the 1970s, the small depot was the last of its kind in Duluth. The depot was also architecturally significant. The building is designed with projecting gables that form a transept. Its architect, I. Vernon Hill, went on to have a distinctive impact on the architecture of Duluth in the early 20th century, using the projecting gables as a trademark. The depot's beauty, lakeside location, and link to the railroad history of Duluth made its preservation a priority. After its closure in 1978 the building was vacant. Duluth architect Edward Schafer purchased, restored, and renovated the depot for use as an office in 1980. In 1986 the building was threatened by the planned expansion of Interstate 35. However, since the building was important as a piece of architecture and a part of Duluth's railroad history, the building was saved. State and local officials decided to move the depot. In June 1986 the depot was removed from its original foundation and moved to a new home in Duluth's Canal Park at a cost of nearly $400,000 (). After its move, the depot hosted a variety of commercial and municipal programs. The city of Duluth sold the depot in 2012. In July 2014 the Endion Station Public House opened in the building, but it has closed as of March 2019.

Operated by Golden Eagle Aviation, the twin- engined propliner carried 37 passengers and a crew of three; 29 were killed at the scene and two later died of their injuries while under medical care.Memorial '70 at Wichita State It was one of two aircraft carrying the 1970 Wichita State Shockers football team to Logan, Utah, for a game against Utah State;Mondout, Patrick (2005), Air Crash In Rockies Kills Wichita State Football Players, Super70s.com, Retrieved 2009-09-10 the second aircraft flew a conventional route and arrived safely in Utah. Pilot errors, including poor in-flight decisions and inadequate pre-flight planning, were officially reported as leading to the crash. Background About three months before the crash, Wichita State contracted Golden Eagle Aviation to supply a Douglas DC-6B, to fly the team to away games for the 1970 season. The four-engined DC-6 was a large, powerful aircraft that could accommodate the entire team. Golden Eagle Aviation did not own the DC-6, but had an arrangement with the Jack Richards Aircraft Company to use it. After the agreements were made, the DC-6 was damaged and was unavailable for use. A pair of Martin 4-0-4s (which had not flown since 1967) were re-certified for flight. On October 2, 1970, these were ferried from the Jack Richards Aircraft Company facilities in Oklahoma City to Wichita, instead of the DC-6. Initial leg Upon arrival in Wichita, the two aircraft were loaded with luggage and the passengers were boarded. They took off and headed west to a refueling stopover in Denver at Stapleton Airport; from there they would continue to Logan Airport in northern Utah. The two aircraft were dubbed \\"Gold\\" and \\"Black\\" after the school colors. \\"Gold\\", the aircraft that later crashed, carried the starting players, head coach, and athletic director, as well as their wives, other administrators, boosters, and family. The designated \\"Black\\" plane transported the reserve players, assistant coaches, and other support personnel. The President of Golden Eagle Aviation, Ronald G. Skipper (1936‚Äì2003), was the pilot flying \\"Gold.\\" Although occupying the left seat, he was acting in the capacity of a First Officer because he did not have a type rating on the Martin 4-0-4. During the flight to Denver he visited passengers in the cabin, advising them that after refueling they would take a scenic route, near Loveland Ski Area and Mount Sniktau, the proposed alpine skiing venues for the 1976 Winter Olympics, recently awarded to Denver in May. The other crew flying the \\"Black\\" aircraft adhered to the original flight plan and took a more northerly route, heading north from Denver to southern Wyoming then west, using a designated airway. Less scenic, this route allowed more time to gain altitude for the climb over the Rocky Mountains. Accident sequence While the aircraft were refueled and serviced in Denver, First Officer Skipper purchased aeronautical sectional charts for the contemplated scenic route. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation report stated the First Officer testified that he intended to use the charts to help point out landmarks and objects of interest to the passengers. The report concluded the crew did not allow enough time for the charts to be studied properly to avoid high terrain before takeoff commenced.NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, SA-421, File No. 3-1127 After takeoff in clear weather, the two aircraft took divergent paths away from Denver. Shortly before the crash, several witnesses described seeing an aircraft flying unusually low towards the Continental Divide. Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at , reported seeing it flying below them. Crash survivor Rick Stephens was a senior guard and stated in 2013, \\"...as we flew along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below the top of the mountains. I got up to go to the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, and I could tell we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us.\\" The overloaded aircraft, nearing Loveland Pass as it flew up Clear Creek Valley, became trapped in a box canyon and was unable to climb above the mountain ridges surrounding it on three sides, nor complete a reversal turn away from the sharply rising terrain. At 1:14 p.m. MDT, the \\"Gold\\" aircraft struck trees on the east slope of Mount Trelease, below its summit, and crashed. The NTSB report stated a belief that many on board survived the initial impact, based on the testimony of survivors and rescuers. The load of fuel on board did not explode immediately, allowing survivors to escape the wreckage, but the passenger cabin was eventually consumed by an explosion before those still alive and trapped inside could escape. Of the total of 40 on board, the death count at the scene was 29, which included 27 passengers, the captain, and flight attendant. One of the deceased passengers was an off-duty flight attendant who was assisting. Two of the initial 11 survivors later died of their injuries to bring the total dead to 31, 14 of whom were Wichita State football players. First to arrive at the crash scene were construction workers from the nearby Eisenhower Tunnel project and motorists on U.S. 6 (I-70). The first officer (company president) survived; he was flying the plane from the left seat. Probable cause The National Transportation Safety Board report states that weather played no role in the accident, and lists the probable cause to be that the pilot made improper decisions in-flight or in planning: > \\"The intentional operation of the aircraft over a mountain valley route at > an altitude from which the aircraft could neither climb over the obstructing > terrain ahead, nor execute a successful course reversal. Significant factors > were the overloaded condition of the aircraft, the virtual absence of flight > planning for the chosen route of flight from Denver to Logan, a lack of > understanding on the part of the crew of the performance capabilities and > limitations of the aircraft, and the lack of operational management to > monitor and appropriately control the actions of the flightcrew.\\" Aftermath The USU president, vice president, provost, athletic director, and athletic information officer were all unavailable in the immediate aftermath of the crash, leaving the game to be canceled by John S. Flannery, a USU Information Services employee. Utah State's football team held a memorial service at the stadium where the game was to have been played and placed a wreath on the 50-yard line. Wichita State University officials and family members of the survivors were flown to Denver on an aircraft made available by Robert Docking, the Governor of Kansas. Classes at Wichita State were canceled for Monday, October 5, and a memorial service was held that evening on campus at Cessna Stadium. The remaining members of the Wichita State team, with the NCAA and Missouri Valley Conference allowing freshman players to fill out the squad, decided to continue the 1970 season; it was later designated the \\"Second Season.\\" Wichita State and Utah State had played in five of the previous six seasons, but never met again in football. Wichita State discontinued varsity football after the 1986 season. The accident was the first of two college football charter aircraft to crash in 1970; six weeks later, Southern Airways Flight 932, carrying the Marshall University team, crashed in Huntington, West Virginia as the team returned from a game in North Carolina. Memorials Interstate 70, milepost 217 Wichita State University built a memorial for those who died from the crash called Memorial '70. Every year on October 2 at 9 a.m., a wreath is placed at this memorial. A roadside memorial plaque listing the names of the victims is located near the Colorado crash site, adjacent to westbound Interstate 70, at Dry Gulch at milepost 217 (), about two miles (3 km) east of the Eisenhower Tunnel.Mondout, Patrick (2005), 1970 Wichita State Football Crash Memorial: Pictures, Super70s.com, Retrieved 2009-09-10 A trail to the wreck site via Dry Gulch is 0.4 miles past the memorial off exit 216.

Instead of the standard low-velocity 40√ó46mm grenade used by the M203 and M79 grenade launchers or the standard high-velocity 40√ó53mm grenade used by the Mk 19, the EX 41 used a hybrid of the two developed by Indiana Ordnance. High- velocity ammunition such as the M430 HEDP and M918 practice grenades were fitted to the low-velocity cartridge cases, in order to have a longer effective range with a lower recoil. An optical sight of unknown manufacture was added to the top of the receiver to take advantage of the extended range of the ammunition. The sole remaining prototype is in the possession of Knight's Armament Company and the Institute of Military Technology. In a 2020 interview with former R&D; VP Doug Olsen, Trey Knight remarked on the EX 41 program with great disdain. Knight described the EX 41 as being extremely uncomfortable to shoot. He compared firing it to, \\"Like being punched in the face... No one wanted to fire it for very long.\\" After discussing the engineering difficulties and use of non-standard 40mm rounds, Knight and Olsen agreed that the program was, \\"Pretty dangerous.\\"  References   External links  * Archived production request for Knight's Armament Company * 20mm AMR ‚Äì New Use for Unused Ammo, SOF Weapons SectionCrane Division, Naval Surface Warfare CenterSmall Arms Weapons Systems Division, USSOCOM Comparative Testing Office * Knight's Armament Interview with Doug Olsen Category:Grenade launchers of the United States Category:Trial and research firearms of the United States ru:EX 41 ","title":"EX 41 grenade launcher"},{"id":"9840609","text":"The NPO Saturn AL-32M is a 92/95 kN turbofan engine based on the Lyulka/Saturn AL-31F and Saturn AL-41F-1 jet engines.Tu-444 on tupolev.ru (english) It is proposed to be used on the Tupolev Tu-444 supersonic business jet.

Bonham (May 31, 1942 ‚Äì April 16, 2016) was an American professional basketball player. He won two NBA championships with the Boston Celtics and a college national title at the University of Cincinnati.

He was twice named first-team All-Indiana and was named MVP of both Indiana vs. Kentucky all-star games as a senior. He graduated in 1960 as Muncie Central's all-time leading scorer with 2,023 points, which also made him the all-time scorer for the state of Indiana. College career Bonham narrowed his college choices to Purdue University and the University of Cincinnati. He attended Purdue for three days, but realizing he would be required to enroll in ROTC for two years and would not be able to have a car on campus as a freshman, he returned home and then decided to attend his other choice, Cincinnati, due largely to the national success gained by the Bearcats during the recent Oscar Robertson era. As a sophomore under coach Ed Jucker, Bonham averaged 14.3 points per game,http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/cinn/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/1011UCMBKMEDIASUP.pdf led the Bearcats with a .760 free throw percentage and was named All-Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The Bearcats won the MVC title and posted a 29‚Äì2 overall record. Led by Bonham, Tom Thacker, George Wilson, Tony Yates and Paul Hogue, on March 24, 1962, they won their second consecutive NCAA championship with a 71‚Äì59 win over Ohio State. As a junior in 1962‚Äì63, Bonham led the Bearcats in scoring with 21.0 points per game and in free throw percentage at .892, again earning All-MVC honors. He was named a consensus first-team All- American selection. The Bearcats went 26‚Äì2 and again won the MVC, but on their way to a third national championship they were defeated in the finals by Loyola University Chicago in overtime, 60‚Äì58. As a senior, he again led the Bearcats in scoring with a 24.4 average and a .819 free throw percentage and was co-team MVP with George Wilson. For the third straight season, he earned All-MVC honors and was named second-team All-American. Cincinnati ended the season 17‚Äì9. In his three-year career, he scored 1,666 points, which was second only to Oscar Robertson and still ranks seventh all-time at Cincinnati. Professional career Bonham was selected in the second round (16th overall) in the 1964 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. As a rookie in 1964‚Äì65, he was a backup forward, played 10 minutes per game in 37 games and averaged 7.4 points and 2.1 rebounds per game. He did, however, win a championship ring as the Celtics went 62‚Äì18 and won the NBA title with a five-game series victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1965‚Äì66, his playing time decreased to eight minutes per game in 39 games as he averaged 5.2 and 0.9 rebounds per game for the 54‚Äì26 Celtics. The Celtics, however, won the NBA title again, this time in seven games over the Lakers. His NBA career ended after those two seasons. He didn't play professionally in 1966‚Äì67, but in 1967‚Äì68 he returned to play in the American Basketball Association (ABA) for the Indiana Pacers. In 42 games, he averaged 5.8 points and 1.4 rebounds per game in what was his final season in the pros. Personal life Bonham served as the City of Muncie assistant parks superintendent and chief caretaker of 2,300-acre Prairie Creek Park in Indiana for 38 years until 2011. For 12 years during that time, he served three terms as a Delaware County, Indiana commissioner. On June 30, 2012 upon his retirement, the City of Muncie declared it \\"Ron Bonham Day\\" for all he has accomplished and meant to the area. He and his wife, JJ, resided on a 52-acre property that doubles as a wildlife habitat in Delaware County. As of 2016 they had been married 43 years, and they had one daughter, Dr. Nicole Sims.

Howard was born in Lexington, Kentucky (then part of Virginia) and graduated in 1797 from the College of William & Mary. He was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly in 1800. He served in the 10th and 11th Congresses from Kentucky from 1807 until April 10, 1810. One week later, on April 17, 1810, James Madison appointed him Governor of the Louisiana Territory (the Louisiana Purchase district north of modern-day Louisiana), which was later renamed as the Missouri Territory in June 1812. He resigned his post during the War of 1812 to become brigadier general of the Eighth Military Department. During the conflict he and Nathan Boone (Daniel Boone's youngest son) attacked Sac and Fox positions in Illinois and established Fort Clark by Peoria, Illinois. He fell ill on the way back and died in St. Louis, Missouri. His original burial location is unknown, although likely somewhere in downtown St. Louis. He was moved to the Old Grace Church Graveyard just north of downtown St. Louis (11th and Warren Street) sometime between 1817 and 1844. He was then (allegedly) transferred to Bellefontaine Cemetery sometime after 1851. However, the cemetery has no record of Howard's interment; therefore, the true location of his body remains a mystery. Fort Howard in Green Bay, WI was named after him in 1816.

He was the Slovak with the highest military function and the only Slovak general during the interwar period in the first Czechoslovak Republic. Family His father Gust√°v Viest was a craftsman, later he was an employee of the town office. His mother Jana (born Grn√°ƒçov√°) came from a family of tailors. He has two brothers (Ivan and Du≈°an) and two sisters (Oƒæga and Anna). He studied at local elementary Lutheran school and later at high school in Rev√∫ca. His older brother Ivan studied in Budapest. The whole family moved to Budapest in 1905 after the death of their father. Their household became a place where several nationally conscious people met in time of their studies. He studied building construction and worked briefly for a construction company in Budapest. In October 1911, he joined the army as a volunteer in the 7th infantry regiment in Graz. He finished his military service and became a cadet on September 1, 1912. First World War He joined the army again during the general mobilization on August 1, 1914. He started as a squad commander and continued as a company commander from November 1914. He was captured during the Russian offensive near Krakow on November 24, 1914. Because of his strong Slavic feeling, he joined the Serbian army on August 1, 1915, then he fought with Serbian volunteers regiment against Bulgarians. He was injured but after healing he returned to Serbian units. In February 1917, he requested to be assigned to Belgorod to form Czechoslovak legions. From June 1917, he served as a second lieutenant and organized the recruitment of volunteers. In 1919, he became commander of the Czechoslovak camp for Slovaks in Irkutsk. The new soviet government did not allow legionaries to return home by the shortest way and Viest with others had to fight his way home cross Siberia. He returned home through Japan, USA and Canada in 1920. Czechoslovakia When he returned to Czechoslovakia, he entered the general staff course and started his professional career as a major. He graduated from the Military Academy in Prague. In the interwar period, he worked on several military and diplomatic positions (military attach√© in Hungary and Poland) and intelligence services. In 1933 he was promoted to the position of brigade general and in 1938 to divisional general. He was the first and the only Slovak who reached the position of general in the interwar Czechoslovak Army. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, he disagreed with the radicalization of the political scene in Slovakia and with negative events like the formation of the Hlinka Guard and seditious anti-Czech propaganda. As a Slovak with the highest position in the army, he was delegated by central government for negotiations with Hungary in Kom√°rno led by the new prime minister of autonomous Slovakia Jozef Tiso. Viest warned him about the negative impacts of radicalization to the security of the state. According to Viest's memoir, general Lev Prchala offered him to perform military cataclysm and take power in November 1938, but Viest considered it too dangerous because formation of borders was not finished yet. Slovak Republic Rudolf Viest belonged to a group of anti-Fascist officers and was against the break-up of Czechoslovakia into Slovakia and the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On March 14, 1939, he signed a memorandum against the creation of the Slovak republic delivered to The Slovak Assembly shortly after the declaration of independence. The new regime did not persecute him, but offered him the function of inspector-general of the Slovak Army. He accepted the function after the promise of the minister of defense Ferdinand ƒåatlo≈° that he would not be in contact with Germans. He was keeping contact with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London and he was a member of the resistance movement \\"Obrana n√°roda\\" (Defense of Nation). At the same time he contributed a large sum for the economic development of the First Slovak Republic. Hungary, not being satisfied with territorial gains from the First Vienna Award, attacked Slovakia on March 23, 1939. Viest became a member of the common Slovak-Hungarian commission which was responsible for establishing a new border. According to his memoirs, he finally decided to emigrate during escalation of German-Polish conflict in August 1939. He used for this purpose the official meeting of the commission in Budapest (August 28, 1939 - September 2, 1939). He got a visa from the Romanian embassy in Budapest and moved to Bucharest where he obtained a false French passport from the French embassy with the help of his Czechoslovak contact. Due to his function of general inspector he had access to all secret materials, however investigation did not prove that he took any of them. Viest was sentenced to death, degradation to the lowest army position and loss of state citizenship on March 28, 1942.As in other cases, Slovak military courts sentenced to death mostly when deserters were already in safety. His family relatives were not persecuted and his brother Ivan preserved a high position in the Ministry of Transportation. Exile On September 13, he arrived in Paris. He became a member of the Czechoslovak national committee and commander of the Czechoslovak army in exile. From January 1, 1940, he was commander of the Czechoslovak Army Ground Forces, later transformed to the 1st Czechoslovak Division in France. After the Nazi occupation of France in June 1940, he moved to Britain and joined Edvard Bene≈° on July 10. On October 10, 1940, he became a member of the Council of State and minister on October 27, 1940. On May 8, 1940, he became deputy of minister of national defense in Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Slovak National Uprising On May 8, 1944, Czechoslovak representatives signed an agreement with the Soviet Union which guaranteed the Soviets would pass the administration of liberated territory to the exiled government in London. Rudolf Viest became the deputy delegate for liberated territory responsible for this task, and in August 1944 traveled with the Czechoslovak delegation to the Soviet Union. After the start of the Slovak National Uprising on August 29, 1944, J√°n Golian became the commander of the 1st Czechoslovak Army in Slovakia and urged the government-in-exile to send Viest to support the uprising. Viest returned to Slovakia during the night of October 6‚Äì7, 1944 to take official command of the uprising, and was made a member of the Slovak National Council on October 13. By the time Viest arrived to take command, achieving the original goals of the uprising was already likely unrealistic given internal infighting. On October 18, 1944, the German Army started a general offensive focused on eliminating resistance in the Slovak territory held by the insurgents. As the situation collapsed, Viest issued a final order from Donovaly during the night of 27-28 October for his forces to switch to guerrilla warfare.\\"Boj za slobodu ƒåeskoslovenska sa nekonƒç√≠, bude pokraƒçova≈• v hor√°ch\\" (The struggle for the freedom of Czechoslovakia doesn't end, it will continue in the mountains) This order had only symbolic value, since the army as an organized unit had already ceased to exist, and the order could not be delivered to all troops due to disrupted communication lines. Viest tried to escape from German encirclement and reach the Red Army. On November 3, 1944, he was captured with Golian in Pohronsk√Ω Bukovec. They were taken first to Bansk√° Bystrica and then to Bratislava. On November 10, they were transported to Vienna on Himmler's order, and then taken to Berlin. There they were interrogated by the SS- Reichssicherheitshauptamt in a prison on Prinz-Albert-Stra√üe, but were treated decently. During the entire period Viest continued to declare support for the restoration of Czechoslovakia and democracy. Information about his last days is unclear. Viest probably died with other Slovak generals (August√≠n Mal√°r, J√°n Golian and ≈†tefan Jurech) in the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp sometime in 1945. While the camp remained in operation until April 1945, records covering the possible execution of the Slovak generals are missing. It is also possible that Viest and other Slovak generals survived the war, yet died later after being transferred to the Soviet Union. After his death, he was honored in memoriam with the Order of Slovak National Uprising 1st class (1945), the Czechoslovak Military Cross (1945), and many other honors awarded by Czechoslovakia and other countries, listed below. In 1945, Viest was also promoted posthumously to the rank of General in the Czechoslovak Army.

It lies approximately south-west of Wo≈Ç√≥w, and west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. The village has a population of 2,300. The village is mainly known for its large abbey. The Abbey was built by the Benedictines in 1150, and occupied by Cistercians in 1163 until 1810. Built over centuries, the abbey - the largest Cistercian abbey in the world - is rated in the highest class (\\"0\\") of landmarks of world's cultural heritage. LubiƒÖ≈º is also known in Poland for its regional psychiatric hospital. History The abbey The village is located on one of the oldest river crossings in Silesia. This crossing was protected by a castle, which was probably destroyed in 1108, and populated by Poles,Weczerka, Hugo, Handbuch der historischen St√§tten - Schlesien, Alfred Kr√∂ner Verlag, Stuttgart 2003, p.279 who lived in a market named Lubies, which was documented in 1175.Adam, Heinrich, Die schlesischen Ortschaften - ihre Entstehung und Bedeutung, Verlag von Pribatsch Buchhandlung, Breslau 1888, p.9 From the 11th century the settlement belonged to various Silesian principalities ruled by dukes of the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty. The Irrenheil-Anstalt Leubus in 1870 In the middle of the 12th century an abbey was founded on the place of the former castle. Sources disagree on the exact date and nature of the foundation. While some sources claim the monastery was founded around 1150 by Benedictines and soon after passed to the Cistercians, other sources argue the monastery was founded by Cistercians around 1163. The deed of foundation was ratified in 1175 by Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, who chose the abbey as the burial place for him and his dynasty. The monastery was settled with Cistercian monks from Pforta in the Margraviate of Meissen,Weczerka, p.277 Boles≈Çaw refuge during his stay in Germany.Conrads, Norbert, Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas: Schlesien, Siedler Verlag, Berlin 1994, p.61 In the same document the duke allowed the monastery to settle their territory with Germans and to exclude them from Polish law, making it the first place of the Ostsiedlung in Silesia.Conrads, p.115 The German small town LeubusWeczerka, p.279 was founded on the place of the former Polish market,Weczerka, p.279 the place Germanized,Conrads, p.115 and received German town law in 1249.Weczerka, p.279 250px The region passed to the Crown of Bohemia in 1329 and thus became part of the Holy Roman Empire. On 30 June 1432 the Hussites invaded the village, devastating and burning the monastery. The area was heavily affected by the Thirty Years' War. In 1632 it was plundered by the Saxons, and in 1639 was occupied by Swedish forces. In the second half of the 17th century the famous painter Michael Willmann resided in the local abbey. In 1740 Silesia (and so Leubus) was taken from Austria by the Kingdom of Prussia. Municipal law was lost in 1740, and irrevocably in 1844. From 1871 until 1945 Leubus belonged to German Empire, Weimar Republic and finally Nazi Germany. It then passed to Poland along with the bulk of the former Silesia Province (1938‚Äì1941). The German inhabitants evacuated or were later expelled, the village resettled by Poles and renamed to LubiƒÖ≈º.

The shrouded figure is seated against a granite block which forms one side of a hexagonal plaza, designed by architect Stanford White. Across from the statue is a stone bench for visitors. The whole is sheltered by a close screen of dense conifers. History Erected in 1891, the monument was commissioned by author/historian Henry Adams (a member of the Adams political family) as a memorial to his wife, Marian \\"Clover\\" Hooper Adams. Suffering from depression, she had killed herself by ingesting potassium cyanide, a chemical used to develop photographs. Adams advised Saint-Gaudens to contemplate iconic images from Buddhist devotional art. One such subject, Kannon (also known as Guan Yin, the Bodhisattva of compassion), is frequently depicted as a seated figure draped in cloth. In particular, a painting of Kannon by Kan≈ç Motonobu, in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and shown to Saint-Gaudens by John LaFarge, is said to have played a major role in influencing the conception and design of this sculpture. Adams Memorial, overview. Photo: HABS 1974. Henry Adams, who traveled to Japan with John LaFarge ostensibly to find inspiration for this memorial, particularly wanted elements of serenely immovable Buddhist human figures to be contrasted with the waterfall-like robe associated with Kannon. In addition to the still and flowing elements, the monument's dualism includes male-female fusion in the figure itself and blends Asian and European ideals of figure. These checks to the standard heroic figure combine to make a \\"countermonument\\" for a woman who disliked monuments, generally. Saint-Gaudens may also have been influenced by Parisian funerary art from his stay in France. Saint-Gaudens's name for the bronze figure is The Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding, but the public commonly called it Grief ‚Äì an appellation that Henry Adams apparently disliked. In a letter addressed to Homer Saint-Gaudens, on January 24, 1908, Adams instructed him: > \\"Do not allow the world to tag my figure with a name! Every magazine writer > wants to label it as some American patent medicine for popular consumption ‚Äì > Grief, Despair, Pear's Soap, or Macy's Mens' Suits Made to Measure. Your > father meant it to ask a question, not to give an answer; and the man who > answers will be damned to eternity like the men who answered the Sphinx.\\" In his The Education ... Henry Adams reflects on the statue and its interpreters: \\"His first step, on returning to Washington, took him out to the cemetery known as Rock Creek, to see the bronze figure which St. Gaudens had made for him in his absence. ... in all that it had to say, he never once thought of questioning what it meant. He supposed its meaning to be the one commonplace about it ‚Äì the oldest idea known to human thought. ... As Adams sat there, numbers of people came, for the figure seemed to have become a tourist fashion, and all wanted to know its meaning. ... Like all great artists, St. Gaudens held up the mirror and no more.\\" At the time of Saint- Gaudens's death, the statue was well known as an important work of American sculpture. Its popularity inspired at least one prominent copy, the Black Aggie, which was sold to General Felix Agnus for his gravesite. ‚Äì An informative and engaging study of the memorial and the relationship between Clover and Henry Adams. On March 16, 1972, the Adams Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Matsuoka left the Soto-shu, Matsuoka holding that Zen is a personal experience, and that the authority of the Soto Sect and its training monasteries (Â∞ÇÈñÄÂÉßÂ†Ç) inhibit the practice of Zen. Matsuoka died in 1997. Dharma heirs Matsuoka named many Dharma heirs, though their qualifications as teachers have been questioned, given the short time of practice required by Matsuoka and the absence of formal ordination. According to Kozen Sampson, at least three of Matsuoka's students received inka shomei. These three \\"were considered to be fully transmitted priests with the status of Roshi by him\\". Four students were registered with the Soto-Shu as \\"initial novice priest\\", and to five students was conferred \\"full priesthood\\".Mount Adams Zen Center, Rev.

During his prolific career he produced nine volumes of gospel hymn vocal arrangements, and a number of solo songs and choral music. The Hooper style arrangements of male quartet music performed by the King's Heralds were widely copied throughout the world. Approximately 100 of his arrangements are now in the public domain and are available online.Public domain arrangements by Wayne Hooper His best known song, \\"We Have This Hope,\\" was created as the theme song for the 1962 Seventh- day Adventist General Conference Session in San Francisco.Voice Of Prophecy press release regarding Wayne Hooper The song was used again as the theme song for the General Conference sessions of 1966, 1975, 1995 and 2000 and has been translated into numerous languages. Hooper traveled widely with the King's Heralds throughout the United States and Canada, as well as tours to Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Europe. He sang in several languages used by Voice of Prophecy affiliates around the world. Known as Los Heraldos del Rey in Spanish, the quartet was also featured regularly on La Voz de la Esperanza, a Spanish-language Seventh-day Adventist radio ministry. Biography Wayne Hooper was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on July 4, 1920 as the child of a chorister and voice teacher. He received his high school diploma from Gem State Academy, Caldwell, Idaho. After completing an associate of arts degree in music at Southern California Junior College (now La Sierra University, Riverside), he taught music at Portland Adventist Academy, was a soloist for The Quiet Hour radio broadcast, and was a singing evangelist for the Potomac Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. He joined the King's Heralds quartet as baritone at the Voice of Prophecy in 1943. After 4 years he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska where he continued his music education, completing his bachelor's degree in 1947 at Union College. Returning to the Voice of Prophecy in 1949, he became part of a quartet consisting of Hooper, Bob Edwards, Bob Seamount and Jerry Dill that performed together until 1962. Following the King's Herald's he continued his service at the Voice of Prophecy as music director, producer of the Sunday radio broadcast, and trust services director until his retirement in 1980. Hooper earned a master's degree in composition, choral conducting, and radio broadcasting at Occidental College Los Angeles and was awarded honorary doctor of music degrees by Andrews University and La Sierra University.La Sierra University announcement of Wayne Hooper honorary doctorate Hooper was married to Harriet Schwender in 1941 and had four children. He was ordained as a Seventh-day Adventist minister in 1955. He and his wife operated Key Music Company publishing music arrangements and books sent worldwide to customers. During retirement Hooper continued actively in music until his death on February 27, 2007 in Newbury Park, California. He was musical co-editor of the 1985 Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal as well as a companion volume () giving the history of the 695 selections and composers. More recently he spent many months restoring and transferring to CDs, the original reel-to-reel recordings of music by the King's Heralds, Del Delker, and other Voice of Prophecy musicians. A special project that he continued until a few months before his death was setting Bible verses to music to aid children in memorization.Battlefield Community Seventh-day Adventist Church article on Wayne Hooper Online music repository The family of Wayne Hooper has made his original compositions and arrangements of public domain music available on a web site repository at http://www.vop.com/hoopermusic.

Such a surface is also the envelope of the tangent planes to the curve. Parameterization Let \\\\gamma(t) be a parameterization of a smooth space curve. That is, \\\\gamma is a twice-differentiable function with nowhere-vanishing derivative that maps its argument t (a real number) to a point in space; the curve is the image of \\\\gamma. Then a two-dimensional surface, the tangent developable of \\\\gamma, may be parameterized by the map :(s,t)\\\\mapsto \\\\gamma(t) + s\\\\gamma{\\\\,'}(t).. The original curve forms a boundary of the tangent developable, and is called its directrix or edge of regression. This curve is obtained by first developing the surface into the plane, and then considering the image in the plane of the generators of the ruling on the surface. The envelope of this family of lines is a plane curve whose inverse image under the development is the edge of regression. Intuitively, it is a curve along which the surface needs to be folded during the process of developing into the plane. Properties Tangent developable of a curve with zero torsion. The tangent developable is a developable surface; that is, it is a surface with zero Gaussian curvature. It is one of three fundamental types of developable surface; the other two are the generalized cones (the surface traced out by a one-dimensional family of lines through a fixed point), and the cylinders (surfaces traced out by a one- dimensional family of parallel lines). (The plane is sometimes given as a fourth type, or may be seen as a special case of either of these two types.) Every developable surface in three-dimensional space may be formed by gluing together pieces of these three types; it follows from this that every developable surface is a ruled surface, a union of a one-dimensional family of lines. However, not every ruled surface is developable; the helicoid provides a counterexample. The tangent developable of a curve containing a point of zero torsion will contain a self-intersection. History Tangent developables were first studied by Leonhard Euler in 1772.. Until that time, the only known developable surfaces were the generalized cones and the cylinders. Euler showed that tangent developables are developable and that every developable surface is of one of these types.. Notes  References  *.

After becoming the seat of Jefferson County, New York in 1805, Watertown grew to be a renowned manufacturing center. An entry in a 1905 genealogical publication by the local historical society described the education of Orville Hungerford as follows: Merchant As a pioneer, needing help with his farm, Timothy Hungerford was only able to send his son to \\"winter schools\\", effectively precluding him from going to college.\\"Daily News & Reformer,\\" in the June 4, 1862, & June 5, 1862 issues, in a regular feature entitled \\"Links in the Chain,\\" extracted and compiled by Richard W.

Not enamored with eking out a living from the land, at age fourteen Orville began working as a clerk in his brother-in-law Jabez Foster's general store in the village of Burrs Mills (also known as Burrville), New York. Orville's initial job duties consisted of \\"sweeper, duster, office-boy and caretaker.\\"\\"The Growth Of A Century: As Illustrated In The History of Jefferson County, New York, From 1793 To 1894,\\" by John A. Haddock, published by Weed-Parsons Printing Co., Albany, NY, 1895, p. 150. This business was a partnership between Foster and Thomas M. Converse. While Orville watched over the store, Foster would head to Albany in mud wagons and sleighs and then make the arduous week-long trek to Manhattan via sloop to purchase supplies before returning to Watertown.\\"Recollections of Adriel Ely and Evelina Foster His Wife,\\" arranged by Gertrude Sumner Ely Knowlton and Theodore Newel Ely, 1912, privately printed, p. 17. Creating such a supply line between Watertown and New York would be critical in later years as well as impress upon Orville the need for solid transportation lines. When Orville was eighteen, Foster moved the store to Watertown, a busier location. Orville's diligence paid off and he became Foster's partner in the firm known as Foster & Hungerford, which profited handsomely from selling supplies to U.S Army stationed at Sackets Harbor during the War of 1812.\\"New York Daily Reformer,\\" in the issues dated August 5 & 7, 1863, in an article entitled \\"Hon. Jabez Foster.\\" Foster & Hungerford developed its own transportation network contracting with others to deliver its war supplies during the 2nd major conflict with the British. For example, in September 1812, Jabez Foster hired Eber Hubbard to move supplies that he and Orville Hungerford had procured on behalf of the U.S. government using Hubbard's boat to journey from \\"Sackett's Harbor\\" down the St. Lawrence River to the U.S. troops stationed in Ogdensburg, New York. British forces ended up capturing Hubbard's boat. In late 1820, Hubbard petitioned Congress to cover the loss of his boat valued between $650-800. Hubbard argued that the government agreed to reimburse Foster for any losses, which should also cover him. Unfortunately, on December 22, 1820, the Committee of Claims in the House of Representatives disagreed that any contractual protections for Foster would implicitly extend to Hubbard.‚ÄúAmerican State Papers.

There Richard joined his cousin, John N.

Hungerford made frequent trips to New York City to sell potash from his ashery in Watertown and purchase wares to bring back to his store.

Banker Three-dollar Jefferson County Bank note issued in 1824 and signed by cashier O. Hungerford Because Watertown, New York was expanding in the early nineteenth century, businessmen there needed greater access to local capital. In 1816, Jabez Foster and others successfully petitioned the legislature to establish the Jefferson County Bank.\\"Centennial Historical Souvenir,\\" issued by the Jefferson County National Bank, Watertown, N. Y., in Commemoration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Founding of the Bank, 1816-1916, Watertown, Hungerford-Holbrook Publishing Co., New York, 1916, p. 24. Foster was chosen to help apportion stock and choose the building location, which was a contentious matter because each community in the area wanted the bank to be located there. The bank ended up being built in Adams, New York and was initially capitalized with $50,000.00, of which half the amount was paid in. However, the bank did not fare financially well in Adams. Pursuant to an act passed on November 19, 1824, the bank relocated to Watertown and the capital fund was increased to $80,000.00. Jabez Foster, who was Orville's brother-in-law and mercantile business partner, served as the second president of the Jefferson County Bank (1817‚Äì1819) and later resumed the office for a short period (1825-1826).\\"Our County and Its People, A Descriptive Work on Jefferson County, New York,\\" edited by Edgar C. Emerson, The Boston History Company, Publishers, Boston, MA, 1898, p. 335. Orville served as bank cashier (1820‚Äì1833) and later as bank president (1834‚Äì1845). In turn, Orville hired his nephew Orville V. Brainard first as a bank teller and then as his replacement as cashier, a position Brainard held for 33 years.\\"Through Eleven Decades of History, Watertown, a History From 1800 to 1912 With Illustrations and Many Incidents,\\" by Joel H. Monroe, Hungerford- Holbrook Co., Watertown, N.Y., 1912, p. 178. An early investor in the bank was Dr. Isaac Bronson, one of the wealthiest men in New York City, who began loaning money in more rural places such as Jefferson County where he could get a higher rate of return.\\"A New York City Creditor and His Upstate Debtors: Isaac Bronson's Moneylending, 1829-1836\\" by Grant Morrison, New York History, published by Fenimore Art Museum, July 1980, pp. 260‚Äì263. Bronson instructed Hungerford in his capacity as cashier to adhere to stringent banking standards such as \\"make the bills of the bank always at par in New York [City] by redeeming [there]; another, never to renew a note for a customer, until the original was paid up; and a third, to refuse to discount paper having over ninety days to run.\\"\\"The New York Herald\\" newspaper, Tuesday morning edition, April 15, 1851, Whole No. 6749, p. 6. By adhering to this lending regime, at least for a while, Hungerford was able to maintain the bank's high profits, which made it one of the best bank investments in the state. Isaac Bronson ended up making a large profit on his sale of stock in the Jefferson County Bank.\\"The New York Herald\\" newspaper, Tuesday morning edition, April 15, 1851, Whole No. 6749, p. 6. In 1824, the Wall Street investment bank Prime, Ward & King, which was headed by Nathaniel Prime, purchased from Bronson half the capital in the Jefferson County Bank.\\"Documents of the Assembly of the State of New-York Sixtieth Session\\", Volume IV, No. 305, In Assembly April 20, 1837, printed by E. Croswell, Printer to the State, Albany, New York, 1837, p. 4. Like any financial institution, the Jefferson County Bank had to be careful when accepting promissory notes, a common form of debt that could be passed on to another person or entity for collection. On May 14, 1825, a man by the name of Heath made a promissory note for $150 with interest, which James Wood from Brownville, New York indorsed. In June 1826, the Bank took the matter to court and ended up getting a judgment against Wood in his capacity as a surety. On appeal, Wood argued that Jefferson County Bank was not a proper corporate body and that its cashier Orville Hungerford reached an agreement with Heath to collect security from him if Wood failed to pay. Hungerford made this deal on his own and then went to the Bank's Board of Directors for approval, but they failed to formally adopt a resolution on the matter. The appeal court found that that the Bank was properly established and that Hungerford's deal was not a defense to being on the hook for guaranteeing payment, i.e., Wood had to pay up.Wood v. The President, Directors and Company of the Jefferson County Bank, 9 Cowen's Reports 194, N.Y. [1828]. Hungerford learned a good lesson that trying to constructively resolve a financial situation could end up in a protracted court battle. In February 1837, an aggrieved director of the Jefferson County Bank filed a complaint with the New York Assembly that other bank directors showed favoritism by \\"knowingly, indirectly, gave more than 250 shares to one person in violation of the law increasing said capital of bank.\\"\\"Documents of the Assembly of the State of New-York Sixtieth Session\\", Volume IV, No. 285, In Assembly April 3, 1837, printed by E. Croswell, Printer to the State, Albany, New York, p. 10. In their defense, the accused bank directors claimed that the legislative committee running the investigation had familial connections to those making accusations and that the committee was holding secret sessions in which biased witnesses were examined. As bank president, Orville Hungerford stayed behind the scenes while others were the public face of the counterattack. It was a wise decision because Orville was subpoenaed to testify about the stock distribution. According to one contemporary source, this complaint to the Assembly was really a power play to oust him from his position.\\"Documents of the Assembly of the State of New-York Sixtieth Session\\", Volume IV, No. 285, In Assembly April 3, 1837, printed by E. Croswell, Printer to the State, Albany, New York, p. 16. In the end, Hungerford subtly beat back his opponents by having his allies present letters as part of the record that focused on the unfairness of the proceedings. He continued on as bank president. On December 19, 1845, Orville Hungerford testified as a witness in the federal criminal case United States vs. Caleb J. McNulty, stating the following: \\"I was president of Jefferson county Bank when elected to Congress, and resigned before I came here.\\"\\"The Daily Union\\" newspaper, Washington City, Tuesday night, December 23, 1845, Volume 1, Number 201, p. 1. Throughout the entire nineteenth century, the Jefferson County Bank, nationally chartered in 1865, never defaulted on its obligations and from 1824 paid its shareholders regular dividends. To put its growth in perspective: in 1821 it had resources of $91,000.00; by January 1, 1916, it had resources of $3,000,000.00. In 1916, Orville's grandson, Orville E. Hungerford, was vice-president of the bank. Orville Hungerford was also one of the founders of the Bank of Watertown, which was capitalized at $100,000, and began operations on January 26, 1839.\\"Our County and Its People, A Descriptive Work on Jefferson County, New York,\\" edited by Edgar C.

In 1823, Orville Hungerford began to construct the largest house in Watertown on a piece of property that he purchased in 1816 for $500.00 from Olney and Eliza Pearce.\\"Watertown Daily Times,\\" 3 Jan 1925, in an article entitled \\"Old Watertown Residences,\\" No. 1.

Landon, published by Historical Publishing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1932, Volume One, p. 424. The outer walls of the home were made out of native limestone. The inside had 10 fireplaces to keep the occupants warm. An ox team hauled the \\"black Italian marble mantel\\" from Albany.\\"The North Country, A History, Embracing Jefferson, St. Lawrence, Oswego, Lewis and Franklin Counties, New York\\", by Harry F. Landon, published by Historical Publishing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1932, Volume One, p. 424. A large carriage house was constructed out back. On November 11, 1825, Orville opened the six-paneled door with a brass eagle-knocker at 336 Washington Street and moved into his mansion. The John Losee House, built circa 1828, located at the 2020 address of 17100 County Route 155 in Watertown, New York, is very similar in design and construction to Orville Hungerford's dwelling. The National Park Service entered the John Losee House in the National Register on February 1, 2014. In support of its requested designation, the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form filed in December of 2013 stated the following: Similarly, in 2016, the National Park Service entered the Norton-Burnham House in Henderson N.Y. into the National Register of Historic Places by relying on the cited architectural reference points of both the Orville Hungerford Homestead and the John Losee House.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, NPS Form 10-900, filed for the Norton-Burnham House in Henderson, N.Y., received by the National Park Service on January 8, 2016, p. 21. https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000034.pdf (accessed September 27, 2020) The English ivy-covered Hungerford residence eventually passed to Orville's daughter, Frances E., a spinster, whose estate conveyed it to her niece Helen Hungerford (Mrs. Leland G. Woolworth). After Helen died, ownership of the house transferred to her sister Harriet Hungerford, another spinster. Harriet had been living next door in her father Marcus Hungerford's house at 330 Washington Street. She moved into the Orville Hungerford mansion in 1946 and lived there until her death on October 26, 1956. By this time most of the family had moved out of the Watertown area and no one wanted to return. The Watertown National Bank bought the property from Harriet's estate and sold it to Joseph Capone, a developer. In turn, John R. Burns, purchased the structure and reassembled the house minus the left-wing several blocks away on Flower Avenue West, where it still stands.Watertown Daily Times newspaper, Watertown, N.Y., in an article entitled \\"Last of Hungerford Family Houses in City May Be Razed\\" by David F. Lane, March 24, 1966. As of 2020, the house is in remarkably good shape due to the loving care and modernization efforts of its recent owners, including Ann E. Philipps, Esq. At present, the old Hungerford homestead on Washington Avenue is the site of a Best Western Carriage House Inn, attached out back to the original carriage house.

Freemason Orville Hungerford became enamored with Freemasonry because many of his mentors and friends were involved in the fraternal organization and perhaps because it gave him a sense of belonging to a collegial group that he lacked by not going to college. Hungerford was a member of Watertown Lodge No. 289 in Watertown, N.Y. as early as 1818.Search of N.Y. archives in September 2020 by the Librarian of the Chancellor Robert R. Livingston Masonic Library, 71 West 23rd Street, 14th floor, New York, N.Y. 10010, showing that Hungerford was listed as a member of Watertown Lodge No. 289 between 1818 and 1827; membership records for this Lodge are scarce after 1827. Website: nymasonic library.org In 1826, Hungerford along with his business partner, Adriel Ely, and others applied for a dispensation to establish a local Encampment of Knights Templar.\\"A Standard History of Freemasonry in the State of New York\\" by Peter Ross, The Lewis Publishing Company, New York and Chicago, 1899, pp. 818‚Äì819. On February 22, 1826, the Deputy Grand Commander of the Grand Encampment, Oliver W. Lownds, granted the dispensation. Hungerford presided as Grand Commander from March 24, 1826, until April 17, 1829, during which time twenty-nine men had the Order of the Temple conferred upon them. However, the 1826 disappearance of William Morgan (anti-Mason), who threatened to publicize the secrets of Freemasonry, caused the public to lash out at the secretive organization. In 1829, a Boston Masonic newspaper, citing the Watertown Freeman publication, reported that a mere 69 people marched through the city to protest the abduction of Morgan when hundreds were expected.\\"Boston Masonic Mirror\\", Boston, Massachusetts, dated October 24, 1829, No. 17. Vol. 1. p. 131. In 1830, a number of prominent masons such as Orville Hungerford and his political mentor Perley Keyes signed the following public defense of their fraternal organization: Due to continued public condemnation of freemasonry, however, Sir Orville's encampment would go dark in 1831. In February 1850, after the furor abated, Hungerford and others successfully petitioned the Grand Encampment of New York to reissue their former warrant, thereby establishing Watertown Commandery No. 11. On January 16, 1826, Hungerford bought from Hart Masey a three-story brick building on Washington Street in Watertown, which housed the Eastern Light Lodge No. 289.\\"Watertown-49\\" by David F. Lane, NY Masonic Outlook, published by the Grand Lodge of New York, Dec. 1931, pp. 108‚Äì109. The deed to the building had a covenant to secure the use of a 40 by 42.5 room on the third floor for the Masons. During the height of the Morgan affair uproar, the Lodge operated in secret, communicating to members by placing a lighted candle in certain windows. In 1834‚Äì35 the Lodge failed to hold annual elections; the concomitant failure to collect dues resulted in forfeiture of the charter, which was reinstated in 1835 upon a successful petition to the Grand Lodge. The Washington Street building was destroyed in a fire on January 27, 1851, and the Lodge moved temporarily to an Odd Fellows Hall and then to several other locations. Marcus Hungerford, the son of Orville, would join Watertown Lodge, No. 49.\\"A Masonic Register for 5855 Containing a List of All Lodges, Chapters, Councils and Encampments, with the Membership of Each, in the State of New York.\\" compiled by JNO. W. Leonard, K.T., JNO. W. Leonard & Co., 383 Broadway, New York, 1855, p. 40. Orville Hungerford continued his involvement with freemasonry while serving in Congress. Diarist Benjamin B. French stated: \\"As a Freemason, [Hungerford] was a constant visitor to our Chapters and Lodges in the District, and never declined any duty that he was asked [to] perform.\\"\\"The Freemasons Monthly Magazine, Volume XI\\" by Charles C. Moore, Tuttle & Dennett, Boston, 1852, p. 92. In 1851, Hungerford was the 15th Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter State of New York, Royal Arch Masons.\\"https://ny-royal- arch.org/wp/past-grand-high-priests/ Community service 1830 Portrait Orville Hungerford Fire was always a threat in frontier communities. In 1816, Orville Hungerford's brother-in-law Jabez Foster was elected as one of the fire wardens in the Village of Watertown. When Orville was younger he often followed Foster's lead, especially since the two became partners running a store. The Village of Watertown trustees passed a resolution on May 28, 1817, proposed in part by Orville Hungerford, to form a fire company.\\"Our Country and its People. A Descriptive Work on Jefferson County, New York\\" edited by Edgar C. Emerson, The Boston History Company, 1898, pp. 302‚Äì303. What became known as the Cataract Fire Company then paid $400 for a fire engine, half of which the Village covered with the other half contributed by businesses and professionals. Orville was actively involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then and now was poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a poor house system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed as one of the first superintendents of the poor house located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the poor house would have a place to live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking oakum.\\"A History of Jefferson County in the State of New York, From the Earliest Period to the Present Time,\\" by Franklin B. Hough, Sterling & Riddell, Watertown, N.Y., 1854, pages 35ff. His concerns also focused on local infrastructure, which would benefit the entire community. For example, Orville played a key role in incorporating the Watertown Water Company to supply fresh water \\"by means of aqueducts\\" to the village of Watertown.An ACT to incorporate the Watertown Water Company passed by the 49th Session of the N.Y. Legislature on April 10, 1826. Not all of Orville's aid was limited to Jefferson County in New York. During the Greek War of Independence from 1821 to 1830 the Ottoman government massacred Greek civilians. The English poet Lord Byron joined in the quest to liberate Greece from Ottoman rule with tragic results. In the United States, the Executive Greek Committee of New York formed to provide relief to Greek civilians affected by the conflict. In 1827, Orville approached some of his compatriots in Jefferson County and raised $135.55 on behalf of the Executive Greek Committee of New-York, which helped fund the cost of shipping supplies to the distressed Greek inhabitants.The Condition of Greece in 1827 and 1828; being an Exposition of the Poverty, Distress, and Misery to which the Inhabitants have been Reduced by the Destruction of their Towns and Villages, and the Ravages of their Country, by a Merciless Turkish Foe by Col. Jonathan P. Miller, printed by J & J Harper, New-York, N.Y., 1828, p. 286. Orville was honest in his public dealings. On August 1, 1828, a man by the name of Barney Griffin, who had travelled from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County Poor House. Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents ‚Äì more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.Minutes of the Jefferson County Board of Supervisors dated November 19, 1829. Even though Orville only had a rudimentary education, he strongly believed that an industrializing society needed more advanced schooling for its youth. Orville contributed towards the education of the young women of the Jefferson County, New York area by working with Dr. John Safford to promote the Watertown Female Academy in 1823. Dr. Safford and Orville's own daughters were the beneficiaries of this effort as both Susan M. Safford and Martha P. Hungerford were early students of the school taught by Gen. \\"Fighting Joe\\" Hooker's sister Sarah R. Hooker.\\"Through Eleven Decades of History, Watertown, a History From 1800 to 1912 With Illustrations and Many Incidents,\\" by Joel H. Monroe, Hungerford-Holbrook Co., Watertown, N.Y., 1912, p. 29.

On March 28, 1828, Orville and his political mentor, Perley Keyes, as well as several others, successfully prompted the legislature to pass an act to incorporate the Jefferson County Agricultural Society, which was established at a meeting in Watertown, New York in 1817.\\"Our Country and its People. A Descriptive Work on Jefferson County, New York\\" edited by Edgar C. Emerson, The Boston History Company, 1898, pp. 247‚Äì249. Keyes was appointed a vice-president of the Society and Hungerford, due to his financial skills, became the treasurer. In 1841 Hungerford became president. His nephew and understudy, Solon Dexter Hungerford, also served as president of the Society in 1854 and 1877. As of 2020, the Jefferson County Agricultural Society, based in Watertown, N.Y., is still in existence and claims to be the \\"oldest continuous operating fair in America.\\"See the Jefferson County Agricultural Society's website: https://www.jeffcofair.org [last visited on October 3, 2020]. Prior to 1832 the only school for boys in Watertown, New York stopped at the district level, i.e., middle school. There was no academic high school in the area. As a result, Orville Hungerford and other prominent figures such as Jason Fairbanks and Loveland Paddock established the \\"Watertown Academy,\\" which opened its doors on September 19, 1832.\\"Part First.

In 1833, Hungerford's brother-in-law and former business partner, Jabez Foster, sold the County some land near Watertown for $1,500.00 on which to build a new poor house. Hungerford and two others were tasked with setting up the new establishment.A History of Jefferson County in the State of New York, from the Earliest Period to the Present Time by Franklin B.

Politician Orville's friendship with local politician, fellow mason, and judge, Perley Keyes, piqued his interest in politics. Keyes was a stalwart of the Democratic party and led its political machine in Jefferson County, New York. Orville looked upon Keyes as his mentor and would take over the reigns of power.\\"The North Country, A History, Embracing Jefferson, St. Lawrence, Oswego, Lewis and Franklin Counties, New York\\", by Harry F. Landon, published by Historical Publishing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1932, Volume One, p. 422. One of Keyes's primary lessons was that a successful candidate needed to be supported by a newspaper. In 1824 until his death in 1833, Keyes supplied the financial backing to publish the Watertown Freeman.\\"Our County and Its People, A Descriptive Work on Jefferson County, New York,\\" edited by Edgar C. Emerson, The Boston History Company, Publishers, Boston, MA, 1898, p. 231.

Emerson, The Boston History Company, Publishers, Boston, MA, 1898, p. 231. Orville Hungerford started his political career at the local level and worked his way up the governmental ladder.

In the summer of 1832, \\"Asiatic cholera\\" spread throughout the country, including the North Country of New York, terrifying the inhabitants. As a result, numerous meetings were held in the Village of Watertown as well as surrounding towns and villages to institute sanitary measures.

However, Hungerford could not be swayed because he wanted to shelter the emerging manufacturing sector from the cheaper wares of Great Britain and other more industrialized European countries.

In a letter dated December 30, 1844, Orville Hungerford, who often clashed with Southern politicians, wrote to Watertown, N.Y. lawyer and N.Y. State Senator George C. Sherman, stating \\"The Rabid Texians started fiercely to drive annexation through without consulting the North, expecting us to swallow the doctrine avowed in the correspondence, that Slavery is right in the abstract.

As of August 21, 2020, see reference website https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/2246851 When Congress was in session in 1845, Hungerford boarded at Mrs. Hamilton's house off of Pennsylvania Avenue between 4¬Ω and 6th Streets in Washington.\\"Picture of Washington and its Vicinity for 1845, with Forty-One Embellishments on Steel and Lithograph; to which is added The Washington Guide containing A Congressional Directory, Residences of Public Officers and Other Useful Information.\\" William Q.

By February 11, 1846, Hungerford moved his Congressional residence in the capitol to Mrs. Cudlipp's boarding house off of Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 4¬Ω West Streets.\\"Washington Directory, and National Register for 1846.\\" in two parts compiled and published annually by Gaither & Addison, printed by John T. Towers, Washington, 1846, Part II, The National Register, p. 11. Hungerford was unafraid of voicing his opinion even if unpopular with his fellow politicians from the same party. Throughout his life, Orville believed in finishing the task at hand before taking a break. When the U.S. House of Representatives conducted business Orville sat in his assigned seat towards the back of the chamber. Representative William Lowndes Yancey, the Southern secessionist and duelist, sat several seats over to the rear. Yancy was not to be trifled with.\\"William Lowndes Yancey and the Coming of the Civil War,\\" by Eric H. Walther, The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, N.C., 2006, p. 84. The Congressional Globe, which covered proceedings of the 29th Congress, noted on page 413 of Volume 15 the following relevant entry for February 21, 1846: Hungerford's clash with Congressman Yancey received regional newspaper coverage. For example, the Richmond Enquirer, a Virginia newspaper, published a summary of the incident on the front page, center column, of its February 27, 1846 morning issue.\\"Richmond Enquirer\\" newspaper, published by William F. & Thomas Ritchie, Jr., Richmond, Virginia, Friday morning edition, February 27, 1846, Volume 42, No. 86, p. 1. In 1846, Hungerford lost his Congressional seat to a Whig party candidate. Before the 29th Congress ended on March 3, 1847, Hungerford was able to manifest his disdain for slavery, which was dividing the nation. Crossing party lines Hungerford voted with the Whigs on February 16, 1847 and on March 3, 1847 to endorse the Wilmot Proviso, which added to the \\"$3,000,000 bill\\" a provision excluding slavery from territories newly acquired by treaty.\\"The United States Magazine, and Democratic Review\\" Volume XX, No. CVI, April 1847, pp. 383‚Äì384. Yet Hungerford still yearned for political power. In 1846, the amended New York Constitution allowed the New York State Comptroller, who was responsible for auditing the state books, to be elected by the citizenry as opposed to being appointed by the legislature. Hungerford saw this office as a stepping stone to either the governorship or the U.S. Senate before seeking even higher office. In October 1847, the bitterly divided delegates known as Barnburners and Hunkers gathered at the Democratic State Convention in Syracuse and nominated Orville as the \\"Hunker\\" candidate for the state office of comptroller. \\"Journalism in the United States, from 1690 to 1872\\", by Frederic Hudson, published by Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York, N.Y., 1873, p. 580.

Flagg, the current New York State Comptroller. \\"Fifty Years in Journalism Embracing Recollections and Personal Experiences with an Autobiography\\", by Beman Brockway, published by Daily Times Printing and Publishing House, Watertown, NY, 1891, pp. 44‚Äì45. The split in the Democratic party resulted in such bitterness that the barnburners resorted to calling the victor \\"Awful Hunkerford.\\"\\"Morning Express\\" newspaper, Buffalo, N.Y., Saturday morning edition Oct. 23, 1847, p. 2. Such factionalism tremendously weakened the Democrats.

Benjamin had a wool-carding and cloth-dressing mill in West Sparta, New York and had convinced Millard's father to have the fifteen-year- old boy learn the trade under his tutelage as an apprentice. According to Millard, Benjamin had him chop wood for a coal pit instead of working in the shop. The two got into an argument about job duties. Benjamin approached the boy, asking if he felt abused because he had to chop wood. Millard, who was standing on a log with an ax raised, uttered: \\"If you approach me I will split you down.\\"\\"Millard Fillmore Papers, Volume One\\", edited by Frank H. Severance, Buffalo Historical Society, Buffalo, New York, 1907 pp. 6‚Äì8. Benjamin Hungerford relented and let Millard work in the shop for the agreed-upon three-month term before walking home alone. The bitter experience of working for Benjamin Hungerford made Fillmore's victory over Orville for comptroller thirty-four years later extra sweet. In 1850, Millard Fillmore became the 13th President of the United States. After the comptroller election defeat, Hungerford grew tired of the partisanship in Washington, D.C. and the stress from being away from his family and business interests. He decided to return to Watertown, New York to complete his railroad project, which he started in 1832. Hungerford, drawn to the challenge of expanding economic opportunity, likely would have re-entered politics after the rails were laid that brought prosperity to Jefferson County. But his unexpected death at age 61 precluded this outcome. A late 19th-century historian stated the following: Railroad President After his shot at higher political office ended, Orville Hungerford began to refocus his energies on establishing the Watertown & Rome Railroad. The Erie Canal was opened in 1825 and many in the North County thought it unnecessary to develop a new mode of transportation to move goods and people. In the early 1830s, Clarke Rice thought otherwise and built a miniature model train, which he and William Smith displayed in the upper floor of a house on Factory Street in Watertown, New York.\\"The Story of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburgh Railroad,\\" by Edward Hungerford, Robert M. McBride & Company, New York, 1922, p. 27. Clarke believed that steam power on rail would supersede steam power dependent on a waterway. Clarke convinced his fellow masonic brother and the area's premier business person, Orville Hungerford, that Watertown was doomed as a backwater without a more modern connection to the commercial hub of the country, New York City. After all, the roads out of Watertown were slow and even slower in the rain and snow. On April 17, 1832, the New York legislature incorporated the Watertown & Rome Railroad, naming Hungerford as one of its commissioners charged with promoting the line. Although, the initial act called for track to be laid within three years and the line to be completed within five years, a shortage of capital forced the promoters to seek extensions of the charter in 1837, 1845, and 1847 at which point Orville was elected its first president. Hungerford played a key role in raising the necessary capital to complete the railroad. A notice in a Watertown newspaper dated May 5, 1847 stated the following: In the summer of 1847, the Board of Directors voted to allocate $500 so that Hungerford and three other railroad directors could travel to Boston and New York City to meet investors and solicit stock subscriptions.\\"The Story of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburgh Railroad,\\" by Edward Hungerford, Robert M. McBride & Company, New York, 1922, p. 31. In 1848, Orville Hungerford and Major Edmund Kirby from Brownville, N.Y. managed to raise enough capital via subscriptions to complete the railroad, which cost $15,000 a mile to build.\\"American Railroad Journal.

Schultz & Co., Publishers, New York, N.Y., Saturday, October 4, 1851, Second Quarto Series, Vol. VII., No. 40, Whole No. 807, Vol. XXIV., p. 631. As a result, actual work on the railroad began on the Rome, N.Y. end of the line in November of 1848.\\"Watertown, N.Y.

Unfortunately, Hungerford never got to see a train complete a journey because he died shortly before the inaugural run on May 29, 1851, covering the 53-mile stretch between Rome to the hamlet of Pierrepont Manor (originally called Bear Creak). The Hon. William C. Pierrepont, who owned the property where the railroad initially ended, followed Orville as president. At 11:00 p.m. on September 5, 1851, the first train steamed into the temporary passenger station on Stone Street in Watertown. The railroad named its fifth engine, the Orville Hungerford, in his honor.\\"The Story of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburgh Railroad,\\" by Edward Hungerford, Robert M. McBride & Company, New York, 1922, p. 46. Edward Hungerford was an acknowledged expert of the history of railroading and built a career around his love of the topic. Orville was Edward's great granduncle. Delivered to the railroad, on September 19, 1851, this engine, built by William Fairbanks in Taunton, Massachusetts, was twenty- one and a half tons in weight.

McBride & Company, New York, 1922, p. 53. By December 1856, the railroad stretched 97 miles, \\"terminating at Rome upon the Erie Canal and N.Y.

Interests Hungerford's primary interests consisted of making money so that he could support his political aspirations as well as fund his many philanthropic endeavors. Along with his Watertown, N.Y. business partners Adriel Ely and Orville V. Brainard, Hungerford was a member of the American Art Union, which established an admission-free art gallery at 497 Broadway in New York.Transactions of the American Art-Union for the Year 1849, American Art- Union, George F.

Death After a 12-day illness starting out as \\"bilious cholic\\", which then affected his brain in the form of paralysis, Orville Hungerford died on Sunday morning at 9:30 a.m. on April 6, 1851.The Reformer newspaper, Watertown, New York, Thursday, April 10, 1851, p. 1. Such illness was said to run in the family. The Otsego Democrat newspaper in Cooperstown, N.Y. stated that the cause of his death was \\"apoplexy\\", i.e., the archaic term for stroke.Otsego Democrat newspaper, Cooperstown, N.Y., Saturday morning edition April 19, 1851, p. 3.

These are two of the numerous newspapers to announce his death. Jefferson County, New York, especially the business interests, mourned the passing of Hungerford. The Board of Directors of the Watertown and Rome Railroad Company held a special meeting on April 8, 1851 to discuss the untimely death of Hungerford, resolving \\"[t]hat the members of this Board attend the funeral in a body, and wear crape on the left arm thirty days, as further testimony of respect for the memory of their deceased President.\\"\\"Northern New York Journal\\" newspaper, Watertown, N.Y., Wednesday, April 18, 1851, Vol. V.

Procedure Hair dye stripping is a chemical process involving the application of a sulfur-based product to hair in order to remove deposited color. Hair dye strippers raise sulfite levels to make hair more porous and reverse the oxidation of color molecules. This breaks the bonds dyes form between one another and the hair shaft that were formed by oxidizing small hair color intermediates, shrinking the molecules and allowing hair color to be washed out of the hair. Because of the chemical nature of hair dye strippers, they are effective on both newly dyed hair and older dye. Note that this type of color correction is ineffective on hair lightened with hydrogen peroxide, as hair bleaching is an irreversible chemical reaction that oxidizes hair's melanin, effectively rendering it colorless. Most color depositing dyes use a weak hydrogen peroxide-based developer, or oxidizing agent, so results may not match natural hair color. Notes for usage It is advisable to follow color removal with a clear color filler before attempting to color hair again because hair will be more porous and re-dyed hair may darken more intensely and quickly. Additionally, hair dye stripping products often have a strong, lingering odor reminiscent of rotting eggs due to their sulfuric nature. Caution Hair dye strippers contain chemical irritants. Avoid direct skin contact and use in well-ventilated areas.

They are often used in changerooms, schools, prisons, and barracks for personal hygiene. Although the use of communal showers has grown less prevalent in the West in the 21st century than they were in prior years, they are often present in school locker rooms for use in personal hygiene after physical education. They also continue to exist in some gymnasia and at many swimming pools. History Modern communal showers were installed in the barracks of the French Army in the 1870s as an economic hygiene measure under the guidance of Fran√ßois Merry Delabost, a French doctor and inventor. As surgeon-general at Bonne Nouvelle prison in Rouen, Delabost had previously replaced individual baths with mandatory communal showers for use by prisoners, arguing that they were more economical and hygienic. The French system of communal showers was adopted by other armies (the first being that of Prussia in 1879) and by prisons in other jurisdictions. They were also adopted by boarding schools, before being installed in public bathhouses. The first shower in a public bathhouse was opened in 1887 in Vienna, Austria. In France, public bathhouses and showers were established by Charles Cazalet, first in Bordeaux in 1893 and then in Paris in 1899. They quickly proved successful, with the latter only closing in 1985. Current status In the United States and in some English-speaking provinces of Canada, students at public schools have historically been required to shower communally with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes. In the U.S., public objections and the threat of lawsuits have led a number of school districts to make showers optional or to abolish the practice entirely. Private boarding schools and military academies in the U.S. often have communal showers, since the focus there is on 24-hours-a-day education and rooming, rather than just acting as day schools. In many parts of the western world, the number of schools with open communal showers has gradually decreased and has been replaced with individual and private spaces for bathing due to students' religious and privacy concerns. A court case in Colorado noted that students have a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to \\"communal undress\\" while showering after physical education classes. According to an interview with a middle school principal, most objections to showering at school that he had heard were actually from the students' parents rather than from the students. Communal showers are usually restricted to a single sex, with the other sex being prohibited entry to the shower area.

It was started by a group of approximately 180 people in the town of Stavanger in Norway in August 1842. The goal was to spread the Christian religion to other peoples, mainly in Africa. Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder became the first missionary, leaving for Zululand in 1843. NMS is currently working in the following countries or regions: Estonia, United Kingdom, France, Cameroon, Mali, Ethiopia, South Africa, Madagascar, Brazil, Pakistan, China, Thailand, and Japan. The society also works in the Middle East through satellite television. The chairperson of the board is Rev. Helge Gaard. Rev. Jeffrey Huseby has been general secretary since 2011.

This line was sometimes referred to as the \\"3 I Line\\", in reference to a corporate predecessor, the \\"Indiana, Illinois & Iowa Railroad\\". That portion of the line west of Kankakee to Moronts, Illinois, roughly parallels the Illinois River in Northern Illinois and was used, in large part, to transport corn toward eastern markets. See Kankakee Outwash Plain History In the mid-1930s, waterway improvements were made on the Illinois River to improve barge movement (for example, new wider and deeper locks at Lockport). These improvements enabled the Illinois River to handle larger barges as well as movement of Tank Landing Ships (LST) constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company at Seneca, IL during World War II to New Orleans. After these improvements, significant grain traffic (primarily corn) was drawn away from the railroads to the river barges. Corn was now being moved to Chicago by barge, transferred to rail car at Great Lakes facilities and then shipped to Eastern US destinations by rail. Prior to 1957, barge rates from ports along the Illinois River to Chicago and then via rail from Chicago to eastern destinations had a total shipping cost of 53.625 cents for corn and 54.125 cents for corn products. At the same time, the rates for shipping corn via all-rail routes from origins on the Kankakee Belt Line to eastern markets averaged 72 cents for corn and 72.5 cents for corn products. What took place from 1956 to the Supreme Court decision in 1964 MECHLING BARGE LINES v. U.S., 376 U.S. 375 (1964) is another episode in the long and continued competitive struggle between the railroads and waterway barge lines. Today Today, the Norfolk Southern operates the Kankakee Belt Route (ex-Conrail, ex-NYC, Kankakee Belt Line). The Kankakee Belt Route sees around eight to ten trains daily, from the BNSF (old AT&SF; main line) at Streator, Illinois to Norfolk Southern Railway interchanges and facilities in Indiana. It still serves as a Chicago bypass. The north-south portion of the Kankakee Belt Line (Gary, IN to Danville, IL) acquired the name \\"Danville Secondary\\" when the line was under ownership of Conrail. South of Schneider, where this N-S line crosses the current Norfolk Southern (ex-Penn Central/NYC) line, down to Danville was abandoned (\\"out of service\\") in 1994. The abandoned portion of the line measures 76.2 miles.http://www.abandonedrails.com/Danville_Secondary The west end of this Norfolk Southern Line now ends at the former Illinois River bridge east of Depue, due south of Seatonville. This Illinois River swing bridge at DePue has an interesting history. The bridge was hit by a barge in the 1960s, caught fire and the bridge tender killed. This swing bridge was removed in the early 1980s, and much of the track from Illinois River to Ladd was removed. Illinois Railway acquired old-NYC trackage between Depue and Ladd. In 2004, Illinois Railway acquired trackage between the Wye (‚ÄúY‚Äù) with BNSF at Zearing, thru Ladd and Spring Valley to LaSalle. http://www.illinirail.com/railnet/ The east end of the Kankakee Belt towards South Bend is unused except for the local trackage around South Bend. NS operates the local trackage of the Kankakee Belt in South Bend in conjunction with their operations of the former New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois Railroad, a Wabash subsidiary, and the Vandalia line, a former PRR route from Logansport. Since the demise of Studebaker and Singer, these lines are lightly used with no more than five customers total. The track between here and the NIPSCO plant in Wheatfield was removed in 1983.

Emma Lahana portrayed the character's live appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Cloak & Dagger. Publication history The character of detective Brigid O'Reilly first appeared in Cloak and Dagger #1 (Oct 1983), and was created by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi. She subsequently appeared in issues #2-4 (November 1983-January 1984) of the same series, and issues #1-5 (July 1985-March 1986) of the second Cloak and Dagger series. In Cloak and Dagger Vol. 2 #5 (Mar 1986), Brigid underwent a drastic transformation and became known as Mayhem. The character subsequently appeared, as Mayhem, in Cloak and Dagger #6-9 (May‚ÄìNovember 1986), Strange Tales #13-15 (April‚ÄìJune 1988), #19 (October 1988), The Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger #1-2 (October, December 1988), #5-6 (June, August 1989), #8 (November 1989), #10-18 (February 1990-June 1991), Web of Spider-Man Annual #9 (1993) and #10 (1994). Mayhem received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #8. However, some of the color plates were reversed in that issue; those pages, including Mayhem, were re-printed correctly in issue #9. Fictional character biography Brigid O'Reilly was originally a police detective in Manhattan when she learned that Cloak and Dagger were attacking criminals in her precinct. she at first wanted to bring the pair to justice,Cloak and Dagger #1 but she eventually learned to trust the young crime-fighters.Cloak and Dagger #4 Later, she took a squad of police officers to investigate a warehouse belonging to the same pharmaceutical company that was behind Cloak's and Dagger's powers. Some corrupt policemen, led by Roger Falcone, exposed the other police officers to a gas to asphyxiate them. With her dying breath, Brigid swore vengeance on Falcone. As Brigid lay dying, Cloak and Dagger found her, and though were too late to save the other police, Cloak surrounded her and Dagger with darkness, while Dagger tried to revive her with light. When this appeared not to work, the pair abandoned her body to search for those responsible.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 2 #1-4 Though O'Reilly died, she was reborn as Mayhem. In this new form, Mayhem helped Cloak and Dagger find and fight the corrupt police. She then killed Falcone as promised.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 2 #5 She then became a vigilante, showing no mercy to the drug dealers and other criminals she pursues. Brigid was considered as a \\"potential recruit\\" for the Initiative program, according to Civil War: Battle Damage Report. Powers and abilities Mayhem exudes a green, venomous gas from her pores. If this gas enters another person's bloodstream, it paralyzes the person for a varying amount of time. Hence, Mayhem attacks people by raking their skin with her talon-like fingernails so that the gas will enter their bloodstreams. The gas can also act like a truth serum, forcing a victim of Mayhem to tell her the truth. Dagger's \\"light-knives\\" dissipate upon contact with this gas. Mayhem can levitate herself and fly. Other version The Ultimate Marvel version of Brigid O'Reilly is a NYPD officer who is hunting down teenage criminals Styx and Stone in an effort to trace the Serpent Skulls gang. Her partner Terry Schreck is critically injured and soon dies in the hospital.All-New Ultimates #1-2 She later speaks to her informant Bart Rozum before learning that Terry's body had disappeared from the morgue.All-New Ultimates #3 In other media Brigid O'Reilly, portrayed by Emma Lahana, appears in the television show Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Introduced in the first season, O'Reilly is a detective who formerly worked in Harlem before moving to New Orleans. She grows suspicious of her partner, corrupt police officer James Connors, and gets confirmation of her suspicions after speaking with Tandy Bowen/Dagger. O'Reilly soon allies with Tyrone Johnson, who wants to avenge his brother's death at the hands of Connors. They succeed in getting Connors to admit his guilt and being arrested; however, O'Reilly then discovers her boyfriend's body stuffed in a freezer, presumably murdered by Connors' connections. To add insult to injury, Connors is released on suspension and proceeds to beat her up in front of other officers, proving that she is an outcast from the corrupt police force. O'Reilly teams up with Tyrone to stop a dark and evil energy, called the Terror, from getting released by evil mining company Roxxon. While aiding him, she is shot by Connors while simultaneously getting exposed to the Terror's energy. She falls into a swamp and later re-emerges with glowing green eyes. In the second season, it is revealed that the green-fingernailed O'Reilly (Mayhem) is a physical copy of Brigid; Mayhem has all of Brigid's knowledge and memories but is a ruthless vigilante without compunction about murder. In the opening episodes, Mayhem proceeds to kill a number of New Orleans underworld figures, and later assumes Brigid's identity to take a criminal investigation into her own hands. In the meantime, Tyrone finds Brigid tied up at home, then teleports with Brigid to Tandy, who is at a crime scene with Mayhem; by this method, the duplication is revealed. Mayhem then starts looking for Connors, in the process killing his partner. Mina Hess' examination of Brigid proves her theory about the separation of O'Reilly's fearful side (Brigid) from her aggressive side (Mayhem), following an experiment with some rats. During the ongoing criminal investigation into the disappearance of a number of girls into a sex trafficking ring, Mayhem crashes a battle with a criminal gang and shoots nearly all the gang members. To save the last member's life, Cloak uses his powers to send her into the Darkforce Dimension. Tandy follows Mayhem into the Darkforce Dimension, unwittingly depriving Tyrone of his teleportation powers. Together Mayhem and Tandy find evidence of Connors' presence and endeavor to leave the Dimension, but Tandy accidentally exits the Dimension with Connors, leaving Mayhem behind. While in the Darkforce Dimension, Mayhem finds despair demon Andre Deschaine/D'Spayre (who stores his victims' despair in the form of records in a record shop) and Voodoo priestess Chantelle Fusilier in the record shop. Chantelle sees Mayhem and signals her not to interfere. Later, while Andre is busy in the outside world, Mayhem starts smashing the records, releasing Tyrone from Andre's spell and giving him the motive to find the Viking Motel where Tandy is being held captive by Andre and his prostitution ring. When in the Loa dimension, O'Reilly runs into Mayhem. The two of them agree that Mayhem will take control at certain occasions. When the two of them leave the Loa dimension, they are fused back into one body. Mayhem and Tandy later have a brief fight on when Avandalia Dewan's body was found unconscious and low on energy and they argue over what to do with her. Mayhem later works to defend Evita from the forces that would threaten Tyrone and Tandy's mission to stop Andre. Brigid is later seen leaving Connors' dead body in the shooting range for her fellow police officers to see where his corpse has a guilty sign strapped to it.

It is located in the Nineveh Plains. In the town, there is a Chaldean Catholic church of Mar Yousif, and a church of Mar Gewargis of the Ancient Church of the East. There is also a Yazidi shrine of Sheikh Adi. Etymology The Kurdish name of the town is derived from the plural form of \\"sheikh\\" (\\"holy man\\" in Kurdish), and thus translates to \\"[the land of the] holy men\\". History Ain Sifni may have originally been a Christian village, but likely converted in the 13th/14th centuries, and a Yazidi community was present by the 19th century. The district was founded on 16 December 1924. Assyrians of the Baz clan of Hakkari settled at Ain Sifni after the Assyrian genocide in the First World War, and were attacked by the Iraqi army during the Simele massacre in 1933. The Chaldean church of Mar Yousif was rebuilt in 1960, replacing an older church built in 1946-1948. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, two Iraqi military installations near Ain Sifni were struck by US airstrikes on 24 March. Two battalions of the Iraqi 108th Regiment, 8th Infantry Division, were stationed at the town at this time. The US bombing campaign against the garrison was ineffective, and an entire Iraqi battalion withdrew with no casualties. On 6 April, ODAs 051, 055, and 056 of the US 10th Special Forces Group and 300 Peshmerga soldiers of the 12th Supay (battalion) seized the town, and 33 Iraqis were killed, 54 wounded, and 230 taken prisoner, and 1 Peshmerga casualty. In September 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) signed a production sharing contract with Hunt Oil Company to extract oil near Ain Sifni, despite the town being officially outside the control of the KRG, and has since been declared illegal by the Iraqi government. The concession at Ain Sifni is estimated to have reservoirs of 900 million recoverable barrels of oil. By December 2012, the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs had constructed a priest house and community hall for local Christians. The town had an estimated population of 11,498 in 2013. Most of the town's population of 16,000 people fled during the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant offensive in August 2014, and under 500 men remained to defend Ain Sifni under the leadership of mayor Mamo al-Bagsri. Humanitarian aid was delivered to Ain Sifni by the Assyrian Aid Society in November 2014. In November 2018, the refugee camp at Ain Sifni, which is inhabited by Yazidi refugees, was flooded by heavy rainfall. The town was the residence of the Yazidi Emir Tahseen Said until he went into exile in Germany, where he died, and was buried at Ain Sifni on 5 February 2019. Ain Sifni is largely populated by Yazidis, most of whom speak Kurmanji Kurdish. Geography =Climate= Ain Sifni has a mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa).

He enjoyed an international operatic career, singing to public and critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic during the first two decades of the 20th century. Biography He was born on 1 January 1871 as Henri Alphonse Brin in Nancy, France. Dalmor√®s studied at the local conservatory of music and embarked on a career as a horn player with the Colonne and Lamoureux orchestras. In 1894, the Lyon Conservatory appointed him to a professorial position. Later, when his voice showed signs of promise, he abandoned instrumental music and took singing lessons in Paris. He made his operatic debut at the Th√©√¢tre des Arts in Rouen on 6 October 1899, in the heavy Wagnerian role of Siegfried. Following this, he spent six seasons with the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels and sang with success at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1904‚Äì1905 and 1909‚Äì1911. His American debut took place in Charles Gounod's Faust, in which he appeared with New York's Manhattan Opera Company on December 7, 1906. He spent four years with the company, specializing in French roles. For American audiences, he created the roles of Julien in Gustave Charpentier's Louise and Jean Gaussin in Jules Massenet's Sapho. Another famous part that he sang was Pelleas in Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. He also appeared in numerous productions with the Philadelphia Opera Company between 1908‚Äì1910. In 1910 Dalmor√®s was engaged by the Chicago Grand Opera Company with whom he performed until 1914. The company was highly active in Philadelphia as well as Chicago and often performed under the title of the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company while in that city. With that company he notably performed the role of Vinicius in the United States premiere of Jean Nougu√®s's Quo vadis. In 1917 Dalmor√®s joined the Chicago Opera Association. There he sang for the first time the title roles in Richard Wagner's Parsifal and Tristan und Isolde. He also visited Germany and Austria on different occasions prior to the outbreak of World War I, performing Wagner in the original language in Berlin and other cities. In 1908‚Äì1909, he appeared at the Vienna Court Opera and undertook the role of Lohengrin, in Wagner's eponymous opera, at the 1908 Bayreuth Festival. Tall for a tenor, he was praised by contemporary critics not only for his strong, steady, well-modulated voice but also for his impressive stage presence and acting. Fortunately, he made a number of gramophone records for the Victor Talking Machine Company which have been reissued on CD. Produced between 1907 and 1912, they confirm the excellence of his musicianship and the imposing power of his declamatory singing, although the top of his range sounds a bit constricted on these 100-year-old discs. One of his most celebrated records is a 1907 rendition of Manrico's aria Ah! si, ben mio, from Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore, in which he displays an admirably smooth legato line, elegant phrasing and a splendid trill. He also recorded a few French songs as well as arias and duets from various operas, including Lohengrin, Giacomo Meyerbeer's Le proph√®te, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Samson et Dalila, Jacques Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Georges Bizet's Carmen, Massenet's Griselidis, and Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette and Faust. Dalmor√®s returned to France in 1918 but subsequently went back to the United States to live where he taught singing. He died in Hollywood, California on December 6, 1939, at the age of 68. Legacy In the pantheon of great French dramatic/lyric- dramatic tenors, his place is secure. He proved to be a worthy successor to Jean de Reszke (the biggest male opera star of his day), L√©on Escalais and Albert Alvarez, each of whom enjoyed international careers during the 1890s and early 1900s. Of those French-speaking tenors who took up his mantle, the most esteemed were Paul Franz and Fernand Ansseau, followed in turn by Rene Maison, Georges Thill and, finally, Jose Luccioni, who was the last representative of this distinguished lineage. Luccioni retired in 1962. There are no big-voiced French tenors of comparable stature singing today.

He was the founder and executive editor of Le Nouvel Observateur weekly now known as L'Obs. Life and career Daniel was born in Blida, Algeria, as the youngest of 11 children. His father, Jules Bensaid, was a flour miller. Jean Daniel attended the University of Algiers before the Second World War. During the war, he was part of a resistance group that aided the liberation of Algiers, and he participated in the Normandy landings as part of the Free French forces led by Philippe Leclerc. Following the war, Daniel attended Sorbonne University (studying philosophy) and worked for F√©lix Gouin as a speechwriter. Daniel was a Jewish humanist in the tradition of the French Left. He was a colleague and friend of Albert Camus, a fellow pied-noir (French-Algerian). In La prison juive: Humeurs et m√©ditations d'un t√©moin (The Jewish Prison), Daniel argued that prosperous, assimilated Jews in the west live in a self-imposed prison made of up of three invisible walls: the idea of the Chosen People, Holocaust remembrance, and support for Israel. \\"Having trapped themselves inside these walls...,\\" wrote Adam Shatz in describing the book, \\"they were less able to see themselves clearly, or to appreciate the suffering of others -- particularly the Palestinians living behind the 'separation fence'.\\"Shatz, Adam (5 April 2012) \\"Nothing He Hasn't Done, Nowhere He Hasn't Been.\\" London Review of Books; page 15. Daniel was a member of the Saint-Simon Foundation think-tank. =Journalism= In 1947 Daniel co- founded the Caliban magazine, which ran until 1951. Following it closure Daniel became a teacher, until he was hired as a reporter by L'Express in 1956. Daniel covered the Algerian War for L'Express; he was sympathetic to the independence cause and received death threats from the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS). He was interviewing Fidel Castro in Havana as news came through of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Castro said \\"es una mala noticia\\" (\\"this is bad news\\"), perceiving that he would be blamed in some quarters for the assassination. Kennedy had given Daniel a message to pass to Castro, which said that the U.S. could respect a \\"nationalist, even communist\\" government of Cuba, but could not relate to a country that was \\"indentured\\" to the Soviet Union. He co-founded the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur in 1964, which had existed since 1950 as L'Observateur politique, √©conomique et litt√©raire (1950-53), L'Observateur aujourd'hui (1953-54) and France Observateur (1954-64). The 1964 incarnation of the magazine was when Jean Daniel and Claude Perdriel took over renaming the magazine and starting its best known phase under the name Le Nouvel Observateur as a weekly. Since then it has been published by Groupe Nouvel Observateur on a weekly basis and has covered political, business and economic news in France and internationally. On 23 October 2014, the magazine was renamed L'Obs.

The disease has a worldwide distribution and is most damaging in cool, wet climates. The host range of the form species hordei is restricted to barley and other Hordeum species.  Symptoms  At first, powdery mildew can be observed as small greyish patches of fluffy fungal growth (mycelium) on the upper surface of the lower leaves. These spots resemble small cushions of white powder. Leaf tissue on the opposite side of an infected leaf turns pale green to yellow. The fungus only infects the epidermal layer and can be easily scraped off with a fingernail. Infections can also occur on the leaf sheaths and ears. Leaves remain green and active for some time following infection, then gradually become chlorotic and die off. As the disease progresses, the mycelium often becomes dotted with minute black points (cleistothecia), which are the sexual fruiting bodies of the fungus.  Disease cycle  The fungus overwinters as cleistothecia on straw, and in milder climates, also as mycelium and conidia on stubble and straw or volunteer barley and certain grasses. Windborne ascospores or conidia are the primary inoculum and can be dispersed over considerable distances. Infection by conidia requires high humidity, but not free water on the leaf surface. Sporulation and spore dispersal are favored by drier conditions. Thus the disease does well under alternating wet and dry conditions. Production of conidia declines markedly as the colony ages. Cleistothecia develop on older leaves as the plant matures. Low temperatures, together with the wetting of the cleistothecia for at least 72 hours, induces the maturations of the ascospores.

Margaretta (or Margaret) Alexandra Eagar (1863 ‚Äî 1936), was an Irishwoman who served as a nanny to the four daughters of Emperor and Empress Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia, the Grand Duchesses Olga; Tatiana; Maria; and Anastasia‚Äîknown collectively as OTMA‚Äîfrom 1898 to 1904. In 1906, she wrote a memoir entitled Six Years at the Russian Court about her time with the family. Early life Eagar was born in Limerick, Ireland on 12 August 1863. She was one of ten children born to a Protestant couple, Francis McGillycuddy Eagar and Frances Margaret Holden. She was trained as a medical nurse in Belfast and worked at one point as matron of an orphanage.Zeepvat, Charlotte, From Cradle to Crown: British Nannies and Governesses at the World's Royal Courts Time at Court Eagar was appointed nurse to the daughters of Nicholas II in 1898 and remained with them until 1904. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, an aunt of the girls later recalled Eagar's great love of politics. As a toddler, Maria once escaped from her bath and ran naked up and down the palace corridor while Eagar discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend. \\"Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus,\\" recalled the Grand Duchess.Massie, Robert K., Nicholas and Alexandra, 1967, Dell Publishing Co., , p. 132 The four grand duchesses began learning English from Eagar and, by 1904‚Äîby which time Eagar had left the Imperial Court‚Äîhad developed a slight Hiberno-English accent in their pronunciation. In 1908 English tutor Charles Sydney Gibbes was brought in to \\"correct\\" this.Alexander Palace Diaries From left to right, Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia Nikolaevna in 1906. Eagar, who grew fond of all four grand duchesses, wrote in her book that she left the Russian Court for personal reasons. However, it was possible that she was dismissed due to the tense political situation surrounding the Russo-Japanese War, as Great Britain largely sided with Japan. Later life Eagar received a pension from the Russian government for her time as a nurse. She exchanged letters with the grand duchesses describing her work as a governess for other families up until their murder in July 1918. Family members stated that she remained haunted by the brutal murder of the family for the rest of her life. In later years, she ran a boarding house. She died in a nursing home in 1936, at the age of 73.

Life Szathm√°ry studied composition with Ferenc Szab√≥ and organ with Ferenc Gergely at the Franz Liszt Music Academy in Budapest from 1958 to 1963. He pursued post- graduate instrumental education at first in Vienna with Alois Forer and‚Äîafter he moved to Germany‚Äîfrom 1964 at the Frankfurt Musikhochschule with Helmut Walcha. Parallel to this he participated from 1964 to 1967 in the Cologne Courses for New Music, studying composition with Henri Pousseur and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and attended the Darmst√§dter Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik in 1964 and 1965, studying with Gy√∂rgy Ligeti . After sitting his A-exams in church music in 1970, Szathm√°ry worked at first as Kantor and organist in Hamburg-Wellingsb√ºttel and from 1976 to 1978 at the Bremen Cathedral . From 1972 he was also active as a lecturer at the conservatories in L√ºbeck, Bremen, and Hannover; in 1978 he accepted the position of professor of organ at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg . Besides guest professorships in Tokyo and Seoul, and organ courses (inter. al., as lecturer at the Summer Academy for Organists in Haarlem, the Darmst√§dter Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik, as well as at numerous conservatories and universities in Europe, North America, Japan, and Korea), Szathm√°ry has developed a worldwide career not only as an organist and pianist, but also as a conductor. His artistic activities have been rewarded with numerous prizes and honors: in 1960 he won first prize in the Budapest Organ Competition, in 1972 he was awarded the Bach-Prize Stipend from the city of Hamburg, in 1973 was inducted into the Freie Akademie der K√ºnste in Hamburg, and in 1987 received the Franz Liszt Badge of the Hungarian Liszt Memorial Committee (A Magyar K√∂zt√°rsas√°g Liszt Ferenc Eml√©kbizotts√°ga) and the Pro Artibus award from the Artisjus Foundation. Since 2009 he has been an honorary member of the Sz√©chenyi Academy of Letters and Arts (Hungarian Academy of Sciences). Since 2007 Szathm√°ry has been titulary organist at St. Peter's in Cologne. As a performer, Szathm√°ry's repertoire encompasses organ music from the 17th century up to the present. A differentiated articulation and ornamentation practice as well as a discreet agogic and fluent tempos show him to be an historically oriented, but a thoroughly individual interpreter in the shaping of details. Open to musical experiment and technical innovations, in particular within the field of new music, he has earned a considerable reputation: In close co-operation with composers like P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s, Vinko Globokar, Heinz Holliger, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Wolfgang Rihm, Peter Ruzicka, Dieter Schnebel, and Hans Zender, he has to date performed about 120 premi√®res and enthusiastically advocates avant-garde organ music (amongst others: Luciano Berio, John Cage, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, Maki Ishii, Mauricio Kagel, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Giacinto Scelsi). As a composer Szathm√°ry pursues an undogmatic pluralism in the application of contemporary compositional procedures, putting a special emphasis on making instrumental tone colors unfamiliar through the use of unusual playing techniques as well as live-electronic and electroacoustic means.

It was founded during Sasanian rule, and was used as a synonym for Ctesiphon by the Arabs, and later by the Muslims.  Foundation and constitution  According to folklore, al-Mada'in was constructed by the legendary Iranian kings Tahmuras or Hushang, who named it Kardbandad. The city was then later rebuilt by the legendary Iranian king Zab, the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (r. 356‚Äì323 BCE) and the Sasanian king Shapur II (r. 309‚Äì379 CE). According to another folklore, the names of five (or seven) cities that al-Mada'in comprised were Aspanbur, Veh-Ardashir, Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.  Sasanian period  Map of Ctesiphon According to Perso-Arabic sources, Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire, was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada'in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze. The oldest inhabited places of al-Mada'in was on its eastern side, which in Arabic sources is called \\"the Old City\\", where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace, was located. The southern side of al-Mada'in was known as Aspanbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. The western side was known as Veh-Ardashir (meaning \\"the good city of Ardashir\\" in Middle Persian), known as Mahoza by the Jews, Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the Nestorian patriarch. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was Valashabad. In 495, during the turbulent reign of King Kavadh I, Mahoza (as the Jews called the city) was the scene of a Jewish revolt led by Exilarch Mar-Zutra II. After the king denied Jews the right to organize their own militia, Mar-Zutra took advantage of the confusion into which Mazdak's communistic attempts had plunged Persia and led a successful military revolt that achieved political independence for the Jews of Mahoza. The Jewish state lasted seven years until 502 CE when Kavadh finally defeated Mar-Zutra and punished him with crucifixion on the bridge of Mahoza. In 540, Khosrau I Anushirvan (r. 531‚Äì579) resettled captives from Antioch to the south of Aspanbur, a place which became known as Weh Antiok Khosrau, a Middle Persian name meaning \\"better than Antioch, Khosrau built this\\". It was known by the locals of the place as Rumagan (\\"town of the Romans\\"), while the Arabs knew it as al-Rumiya (also spelled Rumiya). In 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrau II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, Dastagerd. In 628, a deadly plague hit al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrau's son and successor, Kavadh II. In 629, al-Mada'in was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper Shahrbaraz, but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrau II's daughter Borandukht. Al-Mada'in then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow.  Rashidun and Umayyad period  Map of the Muslim expansion and the Muslim world under the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates In 636, the Muslim Arabs, who had since 633 invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and seized some parts of al-Mada'in. The Muslim military officer Khalid ibn 'Urfuta quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Rumiya and Behrasir. The terms of the treaty was that the inhabitants of Rumiya were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (jizya). When the Muslim military officer (and one of the companions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad) Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas arrived to al-Mada'in, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and was given to the Muslim troops. In 637 Sa\`d made Qa'qa' ibn 'Amr al-Tamimi responsible for the defense of al-Mada'in, and Shurahbil ibn al-Simt as the governor of al-Mada'in. The Persian companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Salman the Persian was buried in al-Mada'in in 656/7. In 661, al-Mada'in was under control of the Umayyad Caliphate, which had put an end to the Rashidun Caliphate. A certain Simak ibn 'Ubayd al-'Absi served as the governor of the metropolis in 663, and another person named Ishaq ibn Mas'ud served as its governor in 685. The Azariqa, a faction of the Kharijites, attacked al-Mada'in in 687/8, and massacred its inhabitants. The city was then governed by Kardam ibn Martad ibn Najaba, and some time later by Yazid ibn Harith al-Shaybani. In 696, the Kharjite leader Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani briefly occupied al-Mada'in. In 697, Mutarrif ibn al-Mughira was made the governor of al-Mada'in, and later in 701, Hanzala ibn al-Warrad and Ibn 'Attab ibn Warqa' were appointed as the combined governors of the metropolis. Some time later, the governorship of al- Mada'in was abolished.  Abbasid period  Map of Iraq and surrounding regions in the early ninth century In 750, the Abbasid family captured al- Mada'in and the rest of Iraq, and declared themselves as the new caliphate. In 754, the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur briefly held his court at Rumiya (which was included in al-Mada'in). He also had his prominent military officer Abu Muslim Khorasani killed at the same place. In 755, the White Palace of al-Mada'in was destroyed under the orders of al-Mansur, who wanted to create a new city, which would later get completed in 762, and would be known as Baghdad, and would become the new capital of the Abbasid Caliphate (although he ordered the White Palace to be restored, it remained in decay). After the foundation of Baghdad, the decline of al-Mada'in became faster, and many of the inhabitants resettled in Baghdad, while the Nestorian patriarch and the exilarch were forced to move to the city. Nevertheless, the patriarch Timothy I founded a hospital at al-Mada'in in 790. During the Great Abbasid Civil War (809‚Äì813) between Caliph al-Amin (r. 809‚Äì813), and his brother al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833), al-Mada'in was captured in 812 by al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn, who then marched towards Baghdad. In 817, the people of Baghdad revolted, and proclaimed the Abbasid prince Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi as their leader. The rebels also managed to capture Baghdad's surrounding regions, which included al- Mada'in. One year later, al-Mada'in was recaptured by al-Ma'mun's Persian officer al-Hasan ibn Sahl, and by the next year, Iraq was once again under the control of al-Ma'mun. During the Caliphal Civil War (865‚Äì866), Abi'l-Saj Devdad, a relative of the Iranian prince Afshin, was put charge in the defense of al-Mada'in in 865.Madelung, \\"Banu Saj\\" The Abbasid caliphs al-Mu'tadid (r. 892‚Äì902) and al-Muqtafi (r. 902‚Äì908) further ruined al-Mada'in by digging it up for building materials to construct the Taj Palace in Baghdad. In August 942, a battle occurred at al-Mada'in between a combined Hamdanid-Turkish army and the Baridis, who both fought for the de facto rule over Iraq. The battle ended in a Baridi defeat.  Buyid period  In 945, the Iranian Buyid prince Ahmad ibn Buya seized al-Mada'in including the rest of Iraq, and made the Caliph his vassal. In 973, the Turkish rebel Sabuktakin seized al-Mada'in and much of Iraq from Mu'izz al-Dawla's son and successor Izz al-Dawla, however in 974 al-Mada'in was once again under Buyid control, and by 975 the rebels were defeated. However, one year later, after the death of the Buyid supreme leader Rukn al-Dawla, a civil war ensured between Izz al-Dawla and his cousin, 'Adud al-Dawla, who ruled Fars, Oman, and Kerman. 'Adud al-Dawla eventually managed to emerge victorious, and conquer all of Iraq. After the death of 'Adud al- Dawla in 983, he was succeeded by his son Samsam al-Dawla, who, however, met resistance by his brother Sharaf al-Dawla, who conquered Fars and Kerman. In 987, Sharaf al-Dawla captured al-Mada'in and then conquered the rest of Iraq. Between 999-1002, the Asadis and the Uqaylids made several incursions into Iraq, and even captured al-Mada'in. In 1002, they defended al-Mada'in from a counter-attack by Sharaf al-Dawla's brother and successor, Baha' al-Dawla (r. 988‚Äì1012). A battle shortly ensured at Hillah between a combined Asadis- Uqaylids army and a Buyid army under Abu Ja'far al-Hajjaj, who had received reinforcements by Bedouins and the Kurdish Annazids. The battle ended in a Buyid victory, and resulted in the reconquest of al-Mada'in and the rest of Iraq.  Seljuq period and Abbasid insurgency In 1055, the ruler of the Turkic Seljuq Empire, Tughril, invaded Iraq and made the Buyid ruler of the region, Al-Malik al-Rahim, his vassal. In 1199, the Jews of al-Mada'in complained about the construction of a mosque that was close to their synagogue. They then openly revolted, and attacked the leader of the mosque and his supporters, with ended in a Muslim defeat. The Muslims then complained to al-Nasir's secretary and requested for aid. Al-Nasir agreed to help, and had the synagogue destroyed.  Mongol, Jalairid, Kara Koyunlu, Timurid, and Aq Qoyunlu period  Safavid and Ottoman period  The tomb of Salman the Persian was restored during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV (r. 1623-40) and was further restored in 1904-1905.  Population and religion  During the Sasanian period, population of al-Mada'in was heavily mixed, it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism. The population also included Manicheans, who continued to be mentioned in al-Mada'in during Umayyad rule. Much of the population fled from al-Mada'in after the Arab capture of the metropolis. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided Ali with presents, which he, however, refused to take. After the Battle of Siffin, the Persian population of al-Mada'in disappeared. During the early Islamic period, the population of al-Mada'in consisted of tribal Arab leaders from Kufa, leaders of the Banu Azd, and figures of prominent Muslim families, who were, unlike the rest of population, not tribal. A companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman was one of these Arab leaders from Kufa, and is known to have had a Christian or Jewish woman from al-Mada'in as his wife, who, he, however, was forced by the Rashidun Caliph Umar to divorce because of the population of marriageable Muslim women in the metropolis was enough to marry. However, during this period much of the population of al-Mada'in resettled in the cities of Basra and Kufa, Wasit, and Baghdad. But at the same time people also moved to the metropolis from Kufa, Basra, and other places. Prominent figures such as Hilal ibn Khabab (who was from Kufa) and Nasr ibn Hajib al-Qurashi (who was from Khorasan) also moved to al-Mada'in. A very small minority of Zoroastrians also seems to have lived in the metropolis, such as the father of the Khurramite Babak Khorramdin, who had resettled in Azerbaijan and married a local woman, who bore him Babak. During the 13th century, the majority of al-Mada'in's population was Twelver Shia Muslim farmers.  Archeology  Great arch of Taq-i Kisra, 1921 Al-Mada'in has received considerable interest from archaeologists since the 18th century; the most famous landmark there is the Taq-i Kisra.

He served in the First and Second World Wars. Born in Glen Wills near Omeo, Victoria, Secombe graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in late 1917 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force. He served with engineering units of the 5th Division during the last months of the First World War. Remaining in the military for the interwar period, he held a number of engineering postings in and later taught at Duntroon. During the early years of the Second World War, he served with the 7th Australian Division during the early stages of the North African Campaign before taking up engineering commands in the South West Pacific Area. After the war he served as Master- General of Ordnance and commanded Northern and Eastern Commands. He retired from the military in 1954 and took up cattle farming. He died in 1962 at the age of 65. Early life Victor Clarence Secombe was born on 9 January 1897 at Glen Wills near Omeo, Victoria, to a miner and his wife. Educated initially at Swifts Creek State School, he later attended a boarding school at Ballarat. In 1915 he entered the Royal Military College at Duntroon. He graduated in late 1917. Military career Secombe was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force in January 1918, and was posted to 15th Field Company, Engineers, on the Western Front. He became adjutant of the 5th Division engineers in January 1919. After attending an engineering course in England he returned to Australia at the end of 1919, and for the next several years held a number of staff positions with Royal Australian Engineer (RAE) units working on coastal defences. From 1922 to 1923, he attended Melbourne University, where he studied civil engineering. By 1936, he had been promoted to major and at the end of the year, joined the teaching staff at Duntroon. Promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, he took up command of the engineering elements of 7th Australian Division in 1940. In May 1941, he was promoted to full colonel and became the assistant divisional adjutant and quartermaster-general for the Syria-Lebanon campaign. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and mentioned in despatches for his work during this time. In late 1941, Secombe transferred to I Corps headquarters as deputy-director, supply and transport. His new corps soon moved to the South West Pacific Area, and he was based firstly in Java and then in Australia. He was responsible for construction and lines of communication in New Guinea during the campaign there against the Japanese Empire. He held a succession of administrative posts for the remainder of the war. He was mentioned in despatches in 1943 and again after the war, in 1947. Following the Japanese surrender he was appointed the deputy quartermaster-general for the Army, and in 1946 became the Engineer-in-Chief of the General Staff. Promoted to major general in early 1949, he was Master-General of Ordnance for nearly two years until he was appointed commander of Northern Command, based in Brisbane. His period in charge lasted for 12 months before he took over Eastern Command, based in Sydney. He later returned to Northern Command. He retired from the army on 4 April 1954 as an honorary lieutenant general. Later life In 1955, Secombe was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The same year, he was made colonel commandant of the RAE. In his retirement, he took up cattle farming on a 10,000 acre (4047 ha) property near Gatton, in Queensland. He later purchased an orchard at Kenmore. He died of cancer on 3 February 1962 in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, South Brisbane, and was buried in Toowong Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, whom he married in 1929, and two children. A son, also a graduate of Duntroon, predeceased him.

The site of Cholula is just west of the modern city of Puebla and served as a trading outpost. Its immense pyramid is the largest such structure in the Americas, and the largest pyramid structure by volume in the world. Cholula is one of the key religious centers of ancient Mexico.McCafferty, Geoffrey G. \\"Cholula.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. Location and environment Cholula is located in the Puebla- Tlaxcala Valley of the central Mexican highlands. It is surrounded to the west by the snow-covered peaks Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, and Malinche to the north. The summer rainy season and the melted snow in winter provide a great environment for irrigation agriculture. There is also a confluence of several perennial streams with the Atoyac River that creates a wetland to the north and east of the urban center. This has resulted in abundant and excellent agriculture during the colonial period, which led to Cholula being known as the richest agricultural region in central Mexico. Maize is the major crop cultivated but they also harvested maguey, chiles, and cochineal for dye. The soil is rich in clay, which made pottery and brick-making an important part of their economy. Textiles and elaborate decorative capes were also popular. =Economy and trade= Cholula‚Äôs strategical location in the center of the Mexican highlands gives it a prime place as a trade outpost. Here, trade routes connected the Gulf coast, the Valley of Mexico, Tehuacan Valley, and La Mixteca Baja through Izucar de Matamoros. From there, trade routes went to the Pacific coast, where the longer Pacific Coast communication and trade route existed. Because of its location, Cholula served as the link center where primary trade routes and alliance corridors linked Post-Classic groups of Tolteca-Chichimeca kingdoms with southern Mesoamerica. Textile production Textiles were of extreme importance for Cholula‚Äôs economy. During the Postclassic period they were a common unit of tribute and exchange. Textiles were manufactured for local consumption and traded extensively by different merchants that frequented the city. Textile production accounts are provided by ethnohistorical and archaeological sources. Spanish writings from Colonial times have noted their excellence in dying techniques and ability to dye wool threads in diverse colors to produce a variety of textiles. Some of the materials they used were cotton, which was probably imported from the Gulf Coast or Southern Puebla, and maguey, feathers, rabbit fur, tree silk, milkweed, and human hair that were all locally found. Artifacts such as spindle whorls found at different Cholula site loci provide evidence for the extensive production of textiles in the site. These are rare from the Formative and the Classic periods but become more prevalent in the Postclassic. Only unbaked-clay whorls may have been used during the earlier periods but these are not preserved in the archaeological record. The high concentration of spindle whorls recovered from Cholula in comparison to other Mesoamerican sites attests to the important role they played in their economy. History Basalt head sculpture Cholula grew from a very small village to a regional center between CE 600 and 700 ce. During this period, Cholula was a major center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan and seems to have avoided, at least partially, that city's fate of violent destruction at the end of the Mesoamerican Classic period. The earliest occupation dates back to the Early Formative period. In the 1970s, Mountjoy discovered a waterlogged deposit dating to the late Middle Formative period near the ancient lakeshore. The earliest construction evidence at Cholula dates to the Late Formative period. Initial stages of the Great Pyramid probably date to the Terminal Formative Period and show stylistic resemblance to early Teotihuacan. Estimates suggest that during the Formative period the site extended for about 2 square kilometers, with a population of five to ten thousand. The Classical period is known for the construction of the Great Pyramid. At least stages 3 and 10 were built during this period and many other mounds of the urban zone, like the Cerro Cocoyo, Edificio Rojo, San Miguelito and the Cerro Guadalupe, were also constructed at this point in time. The central ceremonial precinct included the Great Pyramid, a big plaza to the west, and the Cerro Cocoyo as the west most pyramid of the plaza group. Classical period Cholula most likely covered around 5 square kilometers, and had an estimated population of fifteen to twenty thousand individuals. During the Early Postclassic there might have been an ethnic change, suggested by the influx of Gulf Coast motifs and by the burial at the pyramid of an individual with Maya-style cranial modification and inlaid teeth. The massacre of Cholula Cholula Massacre Cholula reached its maximum size and population during the Postclassic period. It covered 10 square kilometers and had a population of thirty to fifty thousand. During this period, ethnic changes divide the historical sequence into two phases: the Tlachihualtepetl and Cholollan phases. The Tlachihualtepetl phase (CE 700‚Äì1200) is named after the city of the Great Pyramid as it was recorded in the Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca ethnohistoric source. During this phase according to the ethnohistoric accounts, Cholula was taken over by the Gulf Coast group known as the Olmec-Xicallanca, who made it their capital. From there, they controlled the high plateau of Puebla and Tlaxcala. Under this group, the potters of Cholula began to develop the fine polychrome wares that were to become the most popular vessels in all of ancient Mexico. In CE 1200, ethnic Tolteca-Chichimeca conquered Cholula. At this point, the Patio of the Altars was destroyed and the ceremonial center (with the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl) was moved to the present z√≥calo (main plaza) of Cholula. Polycrome pottery from this phase used distinctive design configurations but was derived from the earlier styles. The ‚Äúlaca‚Äù pottery also dates to this period. During this entire period, Cholula remained a regional center of importance, enough so that, at the time of the fall of the Aztec Empire, Aztec princes were still formally anointed by a Cholulan priest. At the time of the arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s, Cholula was second only to the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) as the largest city in central Mexico, possibly with a population of up to 100,000 people. In addition to the great temple of Quetzalcoatl and various palaces, the city had 365 temples. In 1519, Cortes and his troops were allowed to rest and stay in the city on their way to Tenochtitlan, however, at the request of Montezuma II, the Cholulans began plotting an ambush to kill the Spaniards. Trenches and holes with spikes were prepared and women and children evacuated. Upon this discovery, Cortes had the main warriors and nobles brought to him, had them massacred at the central plaza and partially burned the city to make an example of the Cholulans for what he considered treason. A few years later, Cort√©s vowed that the city would be rebuilt with a Christian church to replace each of the old pagan temples; fewer than 50 new churches were actually built, but the Spanish colonial churches are unusually numerous for a city of its size. There is a common saying in Cholula that there is a church for every day of the year. During the Spanish colonial period, Cholula was overtaken in importance by the nearby newly-founded Spanish city of Puebla. Great Pyramid of Cholula Only a fraction of a staircase on one side of the Great Pyramid of Cholula has been restored to its former state. The Great Pyramid of Cholula, Tlachihualtepetl, is the largest prehispanic structure in the world in terms of volume. It is the result of four successive superpositions, the first two from the Classic period. Stage one measured about on the side and was high. The top platform measured about square and featured wall remains of the temple precinct. The earliest pyramid exhibits the talud-tablero motif style and is painted with insects resembling a Teotihuacan style. When the pyramid was originally built in 300 BCE, there were insects painted in black, red, and yellow on it. The second pyramid, which was built over the first one, no longer resembles Teotihuacan architectural style. Instead it is a pyramid with stairs covering all four sides, so the top could be approached from every direction. It measures 590 ft (180 m) on a side. The exposed slopes of the pyramid are earth- and adobe-filled and represent the last construction phase between CE 750 and 950. During the Early Postclassic period, the pyramid was expanded to its final form. It covered 16 hectares (400 meters on the side) and reached a height of 66 meters. The orientation of the Great Pyramid, and the whole site‚Äôs urban grid, is about 26 degrees north of west, a deviation from Teotihuacan‚Äôs orientation. This orientation is aligned with the summer solstice, and it may relate to the worship of a solar deity related to the Mixtec 7 Flower, or Aztec Tonacatecuhtli. Today Cholula is still one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Mexico. Around 350,000 people attend the annual festival centered at the top of the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid of Cholula is still used because the Spanish built a church atop it, a symbol of the religious conquest of Mexico. That makes it not just the largest pyramid in the world but also the oldest continuously occupied building in North America. In the 20th century, the temple was tunnelled by archaeologists. Four major and nine minor construction stages were revealed. These tunnels remain open to visitors and are stable because of the adobe bricks that were used to build the pyramid. Art Ceramic container with lug handles on display at the site museum of the Cholula Pyramid in Puebla, Mexico. The origins of the Mixteca-Puebla stylistic tradition appeared and reflected the Gulf Coast influences. Polychrome pottery was already common by CE 1000, and also resembles Gulf Coast styles. The mural known as The Drunkards is a 165 ft (50 m) long polychrome mural with life size human figures. The scene represented is one of drinking and inebriation but the liquid being ingested could have been derived from hallucinogenic mushrooms of ancient Mexico or peyote, rather than alcohol. =Figurines= Figurines in Cholula are prominent. On an excavation located at the southwestern extreme of the Universidad de las Am√©ricas in Cholula one of the features was a 3.68-m-deep Prehispanic water well that kept Postclassic ceramics and figurines, which accounted for most of the artifacts found. There were 110 figurines and no molds were found; although some molds have been found by other archaeologists in the area. Together with the figurines was a large amount of re-constructible broken figurines and others that were over fired or even blackened and burned. Also, the presence of scoria, pigments, polishing tools, balls of prepared clay, and vitrified abode blocks suggest that these materials may have been waste products from a workshop in the neighborhood. The figurines usually represent deities like in many other Mesoamerican sites, but their shape is unique. They are fa√ßades of about 19 cm high. The front of the figurines are a fairly complex face and headdress set upon a plain trapezoidal pedestal. The back is very roughly finished and has a loop handle that has been seen to be either horizontal, vertical or diagonal to the face, although horizontal handles are the most common ones. Some of them are plain but others have traces of a thin coat of stucco painted in yellow, red, back, brown, green, and pink. In Cholula figurines mostly represent the god Tlaloc. There have been at least six molds found that were used to produce Tlaloc figurines in the collection from the campus of the Universidad de las Am√©ricas and each one exhibits differences in size, proportion, and the detailed elements of its portrait.

Pennsylvania Impressionism was an American Impressionist movement of the first half of the 20th century that was centered in and around Bucks County, Pennsylvania, particularly the town of New Hope. The movement is sometimes referred to as the \\"New Hope School\\" or the \\"Pennsylvania School\\" of landscape painting. The Beginning Landscape painter William Langson Lathrop (1859-1938) moved to New Hope in 1898, where he founded a summer art school. The mill town was located along the Delaware River, about forty miles from Philadelphia and seventy miles from Manhattan. The area's rolling hills were spectacular, and the river, its tributaries, and the Delaware Canal were picturesque. The natural beauty attracted the artist Edward Redfield (1869-1965), who settled north of the town. Redfield painted nature in bold and vibrant colors, and was ‚Äúthe pioneer of the realistic painting of winter in America.‚Äù His thick layering distinguished him from his contemporaries, and he amassed more honors and awards than any other artist in the New Hope Colony. His style is distinguished by its color, light, and usual time of day when painting. The third major artist to settle in the area was Daniel Garber (1880-1958), who came to New Hope in 1907. Garber hated painting winter scenes and applied his paint lightly. An instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Garber played a huge part of the new colony. Garber made rain paintings popular which resulted in the outpour of a new group. Artist colony As more artists came to the colony, the artists formed art groups with different ideas. The two main groups were the Impressionists and the Modernists. Impressionists were painters who did not stay with the traditional pursuit of painting realistically, but instead explored the possibilities of paint and imagination. An important American Impressionist movement is the Pennsylvania Impressionism. The Pennsylvania Impressionist Movement inspired and influenced major artists such as Walter Schofield (1867-1944), George Sotter(1879-1953) and Henry Snell (1858-1943). William Lathrop purchased the Phillips Mill property to use as a venue to hold galleries and exhibitions. However, problems occurred in this venue. Modernist Lloyd Ney submitted a painting of the New Hope canal. Lathrop threatened to reject the painting because the colors were too disturbing. Charles Ramsey, Lloyd Ney's good friend, was disturbed by this comment and formed the ‚ÄúNew Group.‚Äù This group rebelled against the traditional impressionists having to inaugurate before the Phillips Mill Exhibition on May 16, 1930. Many years later a flood of artists came because of the Garber's influence for constant rain in Pennsylvania. This group consisted of prominent artists such as Robert A.D. Miller, Peter Keenan (1896-1952), Charles Evans (1907-1992); Henry Baker (1900-1957); Richard Wedderspoon, Carl Lindborg (1903-1994), Frederick Harer (1879-1947), Faye Swengel Badura (1904-1991), Louis Stone (1902-1984) and Charles Ward (1900-1962) among others. Other important modernist painters to later settle in the area after the initial arrivals were Josef Zenk (1904-2000), Bror Julius Nordfeldt (1878-1955), Swiss-born Joseph Meierhans (1890-1980), Clarence Carter (1904-2000) and precisionist, Richard Peter Hoffman (1911-1997) of Allentown. These fifteen people made a big mark to for Impressionistic society. Finally, there was the ‚ÄúLast Ten.‚Äù This group stood out because this group consisted all of women. The Ten consisted of Fern Coppedge (1883-1951) and M. Elizabeth Price (1877-1965) from New Hope, as well as Nancy Maybin Ferguson (1869-1967), Emma Fordyce MacRae (1887-1974), Eleanor Abrams (1885-1967), Constance Cochrane (1888-1962) and Theresa Bernstein (1890-2002). These women influenced many other women to join the Pennsylvania Impressionism Movement. Similar to the French impressionist movement, this style of art is characterized by an interest in the quality of color, light, and the time of day. This group of artists usually painted in plein air, or out of doors, to capture the moment. According to James A. Michener Art Museum‚Äôs Senior Curator Brian Peterson, ‚Äúwhat most characterized Pennsylvania impressionism was not a single, unified style but rather the emergence of many mature, distinctive voices: Daniel Garber's luminous, poetic renditions of the Delaware River; Fern Coppedge's colorful village scenes; Robert Spencer's lyrical views of mills and tenements; John Folinsbee's moody, expressionistic snowscapes; and William L. Lathrop's deeply felt, evocative Bucks County vistas.\\" Art historian Thomas C. Folk defines the movement as the Late Pennsylvania School, those artists that \\"came to prominence in Bucks County after 1915 or after the Armory Show and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.\\" According to Folk, the three most notable artists in this group were John Fulton Folinsbee, Walter Emerson Baum and George Sotter. One of the artists, Walter Emerson Baum, worked as a teacher and educator and through his founding of the Baum School of Art and the Allentown Art Museum, would serve to expand the influence of the movement out of Bucks County and into Lehigh County, specifically Allentown and the Lehigh Valley, where the movement continued to flourish into the 1940s and 1950s. Today, this group of artists is collectively known as the Baum Circle.

Plot summary Inspector Cramer takes the unprecedented step of approaching Nero Wolfe for his help on a stalled murder investigation. Leonard Dykes, a clerk for a small law partnership, has been found dead in the East River with no leads other than a list of names in his pocket. While initially unable to help, a month later Wolfe is approached by the father of Joan Wellman, a reader for a small fiction publisher who was killed in a hit-and- run incident, late at night in Van Cortlandt Park. After reading a recent letter that Joan had written to her parents, Wolfe realises that the name ‚ÄòBaird Archer‚Äô, an author whose novel Joan was reading for her employer, had also appeared on the list found in Leonard Dykes‚Äô pocket. Wolfe orders Archie Goodwin to explore the link between Archer's novel and the two murder victims. To that end, Archie arrives at the office of Rachel Abrams, a stenographer, mere minutes after she has been thrown out of a window to her death. In the moments before the police arrive Archie confirms that Baird Archer was one of her clients. Wolfe decides to begin the investigation with Dykes, and Archie arranges a meeting with the female employees of Corrigan, Phelps, Kustin and Briggs, the law partnership Dykes worked for. During the meeting, tempers flare and in a resulting argument the former senior partner of the firm, Conroy O‚ÄôMalley, is mentioned. O‚ÄôMalley was disbarred for bribing a jury foreman to fix a case, and while Dykes was blamed for exposing him to the Bar Association it becomes clear that all four of the partners have motives to betray him. Soon after, the five lawyers‚ÄîJames Corrigan, Emmet Phelps, Louis Kustin and Frederick Briggs‚Äîapproach Wolfe, keen to avoid further scandal. The men agree to send Wolfe all correspondence relating to Dykes, including a resignation letter he submitted. When they receive the letter, Wolfe and Archie discover an odd notation, apparently in Corrigan's handwriting, which corresponds a verse in the Book of Psalms. The same verse - ‚ÄúPut not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help‚Äù - was used for the title of Baird Archer's novel, which confirms to Wolfe that Archer was a nom de plume of Dykes and his novel a Roman √† clef based on O'Malley's downfall. Archie is dispatched to Los Angeles to persuade Dykes's sister Peggy to help them trap her brother's murderer. Archie writes a letter to the law firm purportedly from Peggy asking for advice over the legal rights of her brother's novel, and hires a local private detective to pose as a literary agent. Soon after, James Corrigan unsuccessfully tries to acquire the manuscript, resorting to violence and attempted theft in order to do so. Archie begins to tail Corrigan, but soon after his return to New York Wolfe receives a rambling phone call, apparently from James Corrigan, which is abruptly ended with the sound of a gunshot. The police discover that Corrigan has apparently committed suicide, and the next day Wolfe receives a suicide note written by Corrigan confessing to having exposed O‚ÄôMalley and committed all three murders to keep his secret. Although the authorities are willing to rule Corrigan the murderer and his death a suicide, Wolfe has a breakthrough and summons the major witnesses to his office. There, he reveals that the supposed suicide note was flawed in one crucial respect; it claimed that Corrigan was aware of the contents of Dykes‚Äô novel, when in fact Corrigan's actions in Los Angeles clearly demonstrated that he had never seen the manuscript before. In fact, Corrigan was murdered by Conroy O‚ÄôMalley, who had staged his death as a suicide. O‚ÄôMalley had discovered that Corrigan had betrayed him via Dykes's manuscript and had committed the other murders both to frame Corrigan and cover up his actions. After holes in his alibi are discovered, O‚ÄôMalley is charged and convicted of murder. Reviews and commentary * Anthony Boucher, The New York Times Book Review (October 28, 1951) ‚Äî For some years now Nero Wolfe has flourished best in novelettes ... The shorter exploits, annually collected in volumes of three, have been models of the middle-length detective story; but some of us have still yearned nostalgically for the days of such Wolfe novels as Too Many Cooks and The League of Frightened Men. It's a pleasure at last to report that in Murder by the Book Rex Stout restores Nero Wolfe to his proper place in the long detective novel. A man has been murdered presumably because of a novel which he wrote and which has completely disappeared; there is apparently as total an absence of clues as ever confronted a fictional detective. And the story is not so much one of detection, as of the ingenious efforts of Wolfe and the incomparable Archie Goodwin to find some conceivable starting point from which detection can be carried on. It's an odd and interesting approach; the solution is at once plausible and surprising (if not quite deductively watertight). Wolfe and Archie are both in top form and Stout has rarely done a better novelistic job of putting flesh on assorted minor characters. * Stuart M. Kaminsky ‚Äî I am a huge Stout fan. I've got a collection of the Wolfe novels and re-read them. I just finished reading Murder by the Book, definitely one of my favorites in the series. Check Stout's scenes of Archie in Los Angeles. They rank right up there with Chandler, and the characters ‚Äî major and minor ‚Äî are vivid and memorable, not to mention the great give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie.Pierce, J. Kingston, \\"Murder Is His Business\\". Stuart M. Kaminsky interviewed in January Magazine, 2002 * Nancy Pearl, Book Lust ‚Äî When Stout is on top of his game, which is most of the time, his diabolically clever plotting and his storytelling ability exceed that of any other mystery writer you can name, including Agatha Christie, who invented her own eccentric genius detective Hercule Poirot. Although in the years since Stout's death I find myself going back and rereading his entire oeuvre every year or two, I return with particular pleasure to these five novels: The Doorbell Rang; Plot It Yourself; Murder by the Book; Champagne for One; and Gambit.Pearl, Nancy, Book Lust: Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment, and Reason (Seattle, Washington: Sasquatch Books, 2003, ); p. 226 * Saturday Review of Literature (November 10, 1951) ‚Äî Missing novel MS is lethal to NY quartet and disrupts high-toned law office, but orchidaphilic Nero Wolfe pins blue ribbon on felon. Usual scrupulous attention to, and skilled management of, detail; honest, lively, interest-holding performance. *Terry Teachout, About Last Night, \\"Forty years with Nero Wolfe\\" (January 12, 2009) ‚Äî Rex Stout's witty, fast- moving prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe himself is one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels. Adaptations =Nero Wolfe (Paramount Television)= Murder by the Book was adapted as the eighth episode of Nero Wolfe (1981), an NBC TV series starring William Conrad as Nero Wolfe and Lee Horsley as Archie Goodwin. Other members of the regular cast include George Voskovec (Fritz Brenner), Robert Coote (Theodore Horstmann), George Wyner (Saul Panzer) and Allan Miller (Inspector Cramer). Guest stars include Walter Brooke (George [Frederick] Briggs), Delta Burke (Jean Wellmann), Ed Gilbert (Robert [Emmett] Phelps), David Hedison (Phillip [James] Corrigan) and John Randolph (Ryan [Conroy] O'Malley). Directed by Bob Kelljan from a teleplay by Wallace Ware (David Karp), \\"Murder by the Book\\" aired March 13, 1981. =Andre Malraux reference= During his foray to California, Archie Goodwin contracts with a local detective agency for a detective able to impersonate a literary agent, and rejects several candidates who don't fit the role. The one who is finally chosen (and performs to great satisfaction) surprises Goodwin by reading in his spare time a serious philosophical book named Twilight of the Absolute. (Goodwin himself, when later left alone, glances at this book but does not care to read it, preferring to pass his time with newspapers and magazines.) Stout does not specify the name of the writer of Twilight of the Absolute. In fact it is a book by Andre Malraux, translated from French and published in the US by Pantheon Books in 1950, one year before the present book .

He died on June 26, 2019 at the age of 79. Biography An insect enthusiast from a very early age, Brossard held a career as a notary until the age of 38. He then started to travel, and on his travels studied the insects he came across with deep interest. In 1989, after having collected over 250,000 specimens, he solicited the then mayor of Montreal, Jean Dor√©, to open an insectarium. He and Pierre Bourque, then director of the Montreal Botanical Gardens, began a partnership to govern and operate the Montreal Insectarium. Brossard has founded four other insectariums across the globe, some of which are located as far as Shanghai and South Africa. Since the opening of the Montreal Insectarium, his collection, which he continued to amass through his travels, has grown to over 500,000 specimens. Brossard wrote and directed 20 episodes of M√©moires d'insectes (\\"Insect Diaries\\"), and was the creator and host of the televised series Insectia. He was the cofounder and copresident of Montreal's Cin√©ma IMAX les Ailes. In 2004, he was the subject of the fiction film Le Papillon Bleu (The Blue Butterfly) directed by L√©a Pool, based on an event in Brossard's life which occurred in 1987. Working for the Children's Wish Foundation of Canada, Brossard traveled to South America with a boy in the terminal phase of cancer. It was the boy's dream to catch a mythical blue morpho butterfly, which Georges went to great lengths to find in the vast jungles, even putting his and the boy's lives in danger. They finally catch the butterfly, and upon returning to Qu√©bec, the cancer which had been slowly killing the child miraculously receded. Georges Brossard died on June 26, 2019, at the Victor-Gadbois de Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil palliative care centre. He was 79 years of age.

The singer repaid Chabrier by advocating for performances of his operas in Karlsruhe and other places where he appeared.Delage, Roger. Pr√©face to : Chabrier E. Correspondance. Ed Delage R, Durif F. Klincksieck, 1994, pXXI. Chabrier addressed Van Dyck as ¬´ Van Dyck des salons, l'Ernest des boudoirs, le rouleur d'yeux, le coqueluche asserment√©e des dames Anglo-Franco-Belges. ¬ª (Van Dyck of the salons, the Ernest of the boudoirs, the head-turner, the avowed darling of Anglo-Franco-Belgian ladies.) During the years appearing at the Lamoureux concerts, Van Dyck sang in La Damnation de Faust, fragments from Sigurd, Tristan und Isolde, Die Walkyrie, Les Sept p√©ch√©s capitaux of Goldschmidt, and the premiere of le Chant de la Cloche by Vincent d'Indy. In Paris he studied singing with Saint-Yves Bax before making his stage debut at the Th√©√¢tre √âden on 3 May 1887; the occasion marked the French premiere of Lohengrin. Intensive study with Felix Mottl followed before he appeared as Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival in 1888, with great success. The intensity of his acting was praised in particular and he was invited back to Bayreuth on repeated occasions, where he became a proponent of the Sprechgesang style of operatic vocalism. The Vienna Opera soon engaged him, and he remained with the company for a decade, during which time he created the title-role in Massenet's Werther (16 February 1892). He also made guest appearances throughout Europe; among these, he featured in the world premiere of Wilhelm Kienzl's Der Evangelimann in London in 1897. Van Dyck made his American debut on 29 November 1898, singing Tannh√§user at the Metropolitan Opera. He stayed in New York City until the 1901‚Äì02 season, singing not only Wagner roles but also parts in French operas. Having made his debut at Covent Garden in 1891, in 1907 he undertook a season of German opera there. In 1914 he appeared in the first Parisian performances of Parsifal. For the Musica journal, n¬∞ 13, October 1903 he wrote an article on 'Richard Wagner et l‚Äôinterpr√©tation'. Van Dyck sang in the first performance of Debussy's L'enfant prodigue in Paris on 27 July 1884.Noel, √âdouard, Stoullig, Edmond. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, dixi√®me ann√©e, 1884. G. Charpentier, Paris, 1885, p.377. With Camille de Roddaz, Van Dyck provided the libretto for Massenet's ballet set in Courtrai ('L√©gende mim√©e et dans√©e en un acte') Le Carillon, for the Vienna Opera in February 1892. He appeared regularly at the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1894, where his repertoire included Wagner (Lohengrin, Tannh√§user, Tristan) and Massenet (Werther, Des Grieux). Van Dyck made a few acoustic records in the early 1900s (for Path√©, Fonotipia and Homophone) which show a voice prematurely past its prime after a dozen years of hard, declamatory use in heavy Wagnerian parts.Scott, Michael. The Record of Singing. Gerald Duckworth & Company Ltd, London, 1977, p197-198. He died in Berlaar in 1923. He was awarded several civic honours: Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur, orders of L√©opold de Belgique, Fran√ßois-Joseph d'Autriche, and Saint-Stanislas de Russie, the lion de Zaeringhen, of Baden, the star of Romania.

GDIs bind to the GDP-bound form of Rho and Rab small GTPases and not only prevent exchange (maintaining the small GTPase in an off-state), but also prevent the small GTPase from localizing at the membrane, which is their place of action. This inhibition can be removed by the action of a GDI displacement factor. GDIs also inhibit cdc42 by binding to its tail and preventing its insertion into membranes; hence it cannot trigger WASPs and cannot lead to nucleation of F-actin. The GDIs' C-terminal geranylgeranylation is crucial for their membrane association and function. This post-translational modification is catalysed by Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab-GGTase), a multi-subunit enzyme that contains a catalytic heterodimer and an accessory component, termed Rab escort protein (REP)-1. REP-1 presents newly synthesised Rab proteins to the catalytic component, and forms a stable complex with the prenylated proteins following the transfer reaction. The mechanism of REP-1-mediated membrane association of Rab5 is similar to that mediated by Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). REP-1 and Rab GDI also share other functional properties, including the ability to inhibit the release of GDP and to remove Rab proteins from membranes. The crystal structure of the bovine alpha-isoform of Rab GDI has been determined to a resolution of 1.81 Angstrom. The protein is composed of two main structural units: a large complex multi- sheet domain I, and a smaller alpha-helical domain II. The structural organisation of domain I is closely related to FAD-containing monooxygenases and oxidases. Conserved regions common to GDI and the choroideraemia gene product, which delivers Rab to catalytic subunits of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II, are clustered on one face of the domain. The two most conserved regions form a compact structure at the apex of the molecule; site-directed mutagenesis has shown these regions to play a critical role in the binding of Rab proteins.

He was the descendant of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin. Under his rule, the residence town of Coburg prospered with many Renaissance buildings being erected that still remain today. Youth John Casimir was born at Grimmenstein Castle in Gotha on 12 June 1564 as the middle of three sons of Duke John Frederick II, Duke of Saxony and his wife Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim. Because of the Holy Roman Empire's sanctions (Reichsexekution) against Gotha, his father lost on 15 April 1567 his dominions and freedom. Then John Casimir lived with his brothers, Frederick Henry (who died in 1572 at the age of 11) and John Ernest and their mother, first in Eisenach, then at the court of his Uncle John William, the guardian of the children, in Weimar, and finally in Eisenberg, Thuringia. In 1570 the Diet of Speyer restored to the brothers the rights and privileges of their father. Two years later, in the summer of 1572, their mother moved to Austria to join her husband in captivity. A few months later, on 6 November 1572, her two sons were awarded by the Division of Erfurt the Principality of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. The Principality consisted of southern and western areas of Thuringia, including the cities of Eisenach, Gotha and Hildburghausen. The additional guardians of the children were John George, Elector of Brandenburg (since 1578 Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg- Anspach) and the material grandfather, Frederick III, Elector of the Palatinate, and also the enemy of his father, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who supervised the education of John Casimir as well as the regency of the new Principality in Coburg. John Casimir and his brother moved to Coburg on 5 December 1572. His guardians undersigned in the name of John Casimir the Formula of Concord (Konkordienformel) of 1577 and the Book of Concord (Konkordienbuch) of 1580, the two authoritative statements of the Lutheran faith.(de) Cf. Bekenntnisschriften der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche :de:BSLK (Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church), p. 15 and p. 763. Casimirianum John and his brothers Between 1578 and 1581 Johann Casimir studied at the University of Leipzig. On 6 May 1584 he became engaged, without the consent of his father, with Anna, the daughter of Augustus of Saxony, whom he married on 16 January 1586 in Dresden. Only after the death of the Elector Augustus of Saxony on 11 February 1586 was Duke John Casimir at the age of 22 years able to undertake with his brother John Ernest the government of his principality. Reign In 1596 the brothers divided their Principality in two. John Ernest was given the Principality of Saxe-Eisenach and Casimir continued to reign alone in Coburg. His dominions were composed of the districts of Coburg with the subdivisions of Lauter, Rodach and Gestungshausen bei Sonnefeld, Heldburg with a subdivision of Hildburghausen, R√∂mhild, Eisfeld, Schalkau, Sonneberg, Neustadt, Neuhaus, M√∂nchr√∂den and Sonnefeld. Government buildings, now the Stadthaus (town house), at the Marktplatz (Market Square) Under John Casimir, the city of his residence, Coburg, had its first cultural peak with a boost to construction. The Schloss Ehrenburg was rebuilt in the Renaissance style as the Stadtschloss (town castle). The former Schloss Callenberg, was expanded into a hunting lodge; its chapel was consecrated in 1618 as the first Protestant sanctuary in the Coburger Land. The Veste Coburg was converted to a ducal fortress, and the arsenal as well as the government buildings (Stadthaus) were rebuilt at the Marktplatz (Market Square). The choir of Morizkirche was endowed by John Casimir in 1598 in the honor of his parents with a huge Renaissance epitaph ‚Äì a 12-meter-tall (39-feet-tall) alabaster monument with a richly sculptured series of pictures. In addition, he founded the Gymnasium Casimirianum, extended the castle‚Äôs library to include his inheritance of book collections and in 1603 hired the composer Melchior Franck as the Hofkapellmeister (court master of music). The court‚Äôs household, for a time, held 213 people and 130 horses. Politically John Casimir succeeded in getting the Reichsritterschaft (Community of the Imperial Knights) to submit to his sovereignty by guaranteeing the jurisdiction over their country estates. He issued the order to establish the State Lutheran Church with the Duke as the summus episcopus (Latin, ‚Äúhighest bishop‚Äù), the tactic later adopted by many of the Thuringian states. As the only supreme authority of justice and religion in the Principality, he built in Coburg in 1589 an Hofgericht (Special Court for the Nobles), an Appellationsrat (Court of Appeals), a Sch√∂ppenstuhl (Court of Justice) and in 1593 added for the Lutheran Church a consistory, which also covered Saxe- Weimar but remained in Jena. Above all, he built, as the core of his government of Coburg, an administrative apparatus, which persisted after his death and survived many political upheavals. Duke Casimir managed to remain neutral in the Thirty Years War until 1631. After he joined the Protestant side under Sweden, the Imperial and Bavarian troops under Wallenstein carried out the occupation of Coburg and the unsuccessful siege of the Veste in 1632. During his reign, the witch trials and burnings were at their height. He allowed 178 witch trials to proceed. In 1593 Duke John Casimir divorced his first wife for adultery and he then held her captive until her death at the Veste. In 1599, he married Margaret, the daughter of William, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg.(de) Das f√ºrstliche Beilager Herzog Johann Casimirs auf Schloss Heldburg und in Coburg (The Princely Nuptials (wedding) of Duke John Casimir at the Heldburg Castle and in Coburg), see: Norbert Klaus Fuchs: Das Heldburger Land ‚Äì ein historischer Reisef√ºhrer (The Land of Heldburg ‚Äì a Historical Guide); Bad Langensalza, Verlag Rockstuhl, 2013, John died in Coburg on 16 July 1633. Because he was childless, his inheritance fell to his brother John Ernst of Saxe-Eisenach. He is buried in Morizkirche at Coburg. His coffin is in the crypt below the church.

However, the results are not definitive, because many disorders or problems can cause unsteady gait (such as vision difficulties and problems with the motor neurons or associative cortex).

Born in the United States, where he first began competing in skiing events, Chappuis moved with his family to France as a child. Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics, he had seen success in a number of international competitions, including World Cup events. He won the gold medal in the 10km individual normal hill at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada after passing race leader Johnny Spillane in a dramatic sprint at the finish line. His final time was only .4 seconds faster than Spillane's, the closest finish in a Nordic combined race in Olympic history. Lamy-Chappuis, five times world champion and three times in a row winner of the overall classification of the Nordic Combined World Cup (2010, 2011, 2012) and also, winner of the sprint discipline in 2007, is a member of the Bois d'Amont ski club in the French department of Jura. He works for the French border patrol in addition to pursuing his athletic career. He returned in World Cup competitions on 24 November 2017, in Ruka, Finland. Personal life Born to a French father and an American mother in Missoula, Montana, Lamy-Chappuis lived in the United States until he was 5, living mainly at Copper Mountain, Colorado. He participated in his first ski racing events at Club Med in Copper Mountain, Colorado as a child. In 1991, at the age of five, he moved to the small village of Bois-d'Amont in eastern France with his parents. There, he attended school and began more intensive training, but continued to race for NASTAR, the American racing program, that year. Lamy- Chappuis still has many family members in the United States, many of whom traveled to Vancouver to cheer for him in the 2010 Olympics. He also maintains close ties to the American ski team, resulting in U.S. coach Dave Jarrett suggesting jokingly that Lamy-Chappuis switch back to his American citizenship to compete for them. Before flying to Vancouver for the 2010 Olympics, he attended a pre-Olympic training camp in Park City, Utah with the Americans. An avid flying enthusiast, Lamy-Chappuis started taking flying lessons at the age of 18, so far logging 70 flight hours. His website reflects his passion for flying and is designed to look like a cockpit. He has stated that he plans to focus on receiving his pilot's license following the 2009‚Äì2010 season. In addition to skiing, Lamy-Chappuis works as a French border patrol officer. His nickname is \\"J√®z.\\" Jason Lamy-Chappuis announced February 28, 2015, after winning his fifth world title in the team sprint with Francois Braud Falun he decided to take his retirement at the end of the 2014-2015 season to concentrate on his training airline pilot.:fr:Jason Lamy-Chappuis Athletic career Lamy-Chappuis' first ski jumping competition was in Les Rousses, France in 1991. Even though it was his first competition, he left as the winner. Since he had won cross-country competitions in the U.S. and ski jumping contests in France, he decided to continue pursuing both events through the Nordic combined. After establishing himself as a top regional skier in France, Lamy-Chappuis competed in his first international event in a European Cup Games competition in Planica, Slovenia during the 1999‚Äì2000 season. In 2001‚Äì2002, he debuted on the French national junior team, leading to appearances in major competitions in Norway, Sweden, Slovenia, Italy, Finland, and Germany during his teenage years. Although he was routinely ranked among the top competitors on the circuit, Lamy-Chappuis has said that \\"I don't feel like I ever performed to my full potential on the World Cup circuit.\\" He participated in his World Cup event in 2004 in Oslo, Norway. In 2006, Lamy-Chappuis became the French champion of the Nordic combined and won two World Cup events, at Kuusamo and Sapporo. He made his Olympic debut at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, placing 11th in the Nordic combined, 4th in the sprint, and 5th in the team event. His fourth-place finish in the sprint left him less than 15 seconds short of the bronze medal finish time, inspiring him to train harder to avoid such disappointment in the future. In the 2006-07, Lamy-Chappuis won the World Cup overall sprint ranking and finished second in the general ranking. Lamy-Chappuis participated in and won the 7.5 km sprint event at the 2007 Holmenkollen ski festival. He also won the French national championships that year, a feat he repeated in 2007‚Äì2008. In 2009, Lamy-Chappuis won two bronze medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Liberec, in the 10 km individual large-hill and 10 km mass- start events. =Olympic Gold Medal= With five wins and nine podiums, Lamy- Chappuis entered the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada as the World Cup leader in Nordic combined. On Sunday, February 14, Lamy-Chappuis won the Olympic gold medal in the 10km individual normal hill. His winning time was 25:47.1 and came after a frantic finish that involved a last-minute push on his part to beat American Johnny Spillane by .4 seconds. Spillane held the lead until Lamy-Chappuis' final sprint at the finish line eked out the win. It was the closest finish in Olympic Nordic combined history. Earlier in the day, he had finished fifth in the ski jump portion of the competition, one spot behind Spillane. Lamy-Chappuis said after the race that he \\"honestly didn't think [he] could get the gold medal\\" after seeing Spillane's lead following the last hill. He attributed his win to Spillane's decision to slow down while entering the stadium, leaving Lamy-Chappuis with the opportunity to glide faster in the final stretch. The win made Lamy- Chappuis France's second gold medalist of the 2010 Winter Olympics, following Vincent Jay's gold medal earlier in the day in the men's 10 km biathlon sprint. Lamy-Chappuis told the American media that he felt significant pressure from the French media to win the gold medal due to his World Cup success and the belief in the French media that he was \\"the best chance of a medal for France.\\" =After 2010= Lamy-Chappuis qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics but finished far from the podium. In May 2017, he said that he goes out of the retirement and starts preparing for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Lamy-Chappuis indeed qualified for the Olympics for both individual and team events, however, he was not considered a medal contender in individual events and hoped to medal, together with the French team, in the team competition.

The reaction product is an alkylated arene compound. The reaction is named after Hans Meerwein, one of its inventors who first published it in 1939. Meerwein arylation An electron-withdrawing group (EWG) on the alkene makes it electron deficient and although the reaction mechanism is unclear, involvement of an aryl radical is presumed after loss of nitrogen in the diazonium salt followed by a free radical addition. In the primary reaction product the intermediate alkyl radical is then captured by the diazonium counterion X which is usually a halogen or a tetrafluoroborate. In a subsequent step an elimination reaction liberates HX (for instance hydrochloric acid) and an aryl vinyl compound is formed. The reaction mechanism from the arene's view ranks as a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. In a general scope a Meerwein arylation is any reaction between an aryl radical and an alkene. The initial intermediate is an aryl enthenyl radical which can react with many trapping reagents such as hydrogen or halogens or with those based on nitrogen or sulfur. Scope A reported reaction of alkene acrylic acid with an aryl diazonium salt and copper(I) bromide and hydrobromic acid yields the Œ±-bromocarboxylic acid. When the alkene is butadiene the initial reaction product with catalyst copper(II) chloride is a 4-chloro-2-butene and after an elimination the aryl substituted butadiene.

According to Toker, Islam is anti-woman as it humiliates women and turns them into servants of the men. It is also anti-man, because it reduces men to breeding animals controlled by their urges. She also said that she does not distinguish between Islam and fundamentalism since according to her, \\"Islam is inherently radical\\". Natalie Wiesmann: \\"Wir Atheisten m√ºssen lauter werden\\" , die tageszeitung, 4 April 2007] The Council is also critical of umbrella organizations in Germany, which they say represent only political Islam and not most of the Muslims in Germany, and accuses them of being responsible for the appalling conditions under which many Muslims in Germany live. Political Demands by the Council In different interviews Ahadi has stated that it was not possible to reform Islam, that she is critical of all religions and not only of Islam, but that she does not want to abolish religion.Abdo Al- Mikhlafy: Islam Can't Be Reformed, Says Founder of Ex-Muslim Group , DW, 3 March 2007 The Council would like to live in peaceful and tolerant coexistence with Muslims in Germany. In 2008 and 2013, the Council and the Giordano Bruno Foundation co-hosted the Kritische Islamkonferenz. The first aimed to stimulate the growth of the newly established ex-Muslim movement in Europe, the second was mostly intended to forge alliances between ex-Muslims and progressive/reformist Muslims against Islamism and xenophobia in Germany.

Carne Ross taught in Zimbabwe before attending the University of Exeter where he studied economics and politics. He joined the British foreign service in 1989. Ross's testimony in the Butler Review directly contradicted the British position on the justification behind the invasion of Iraq.  Career  After graduating from Exeter University, Ross joined the British Foreign Office and worked at the UK embassy in Bonn, Germany before moving to the UK mission to the UN, where he worked from December 1997 to June 2002. At the UN, Ross served as the UK delegation's expert on the Middle East. Ross also worked on several important Security Council resolutions such as SCR 1284 which rewrote the Council's Iraq policy and established UNMOVIC, the weapons inspection body. He also negotiated for the UK the resolution establishing the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and the Council's resolution of 12 September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before. Ross then served as Strategy Coordinator for the UN in Kosovo (UNMIK) where he devised and led a joint UN and government policy to implement a series of standards to improve governance, the rule of law and human rights protection, and advised the Secretary-General's Special Representative on diplomatic and political tactics. He resigned from the Foreign Office after 15 years of service, citing his then-secret evidence to the Butler Review as the reason. In 2007, he is a supporter of a UN Parliamentary Assembly. In 2004, he founded the non- governmental organisation Independent Diplomat.  Testimony on the UK's role in the invasion of Iraq  Ross testified during the Butler Review, which investigated intelligence blunders in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. He testified that at no time during his work on Iraq (1998‚Äì2002) did the UK or US assess that Iraq's WMD posed a threat. He also argued that available alternatives to war, namely targeting Iraq's illegal oil revenues, were ignored. This testimony directly challenged Blair's assertions that the war was legally justified by Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction which posed a threat to British interests. The testimony was published by the Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs after MPs sought assurances from the Foreign Office that it would not breach the Official Secrets Act. In an interview with the Brooklyn Rail, Ross stated that \\"[i]n many ways, the sanctions on the Iraqi people were worse than the war because the economy was taken back decades and the health service deteriorated massively.\\"  Publications and documentary  Ross published a book called Independent Diplomat: Dispatches from an Unaccountable Elite in 2007 and a book called The Leaderless Revolution in 2011. He wrote a play called The Fox, which enjoyed a short run in New York in early 2001. He also appeared as an extra in an Alan Partridge Christmas Special. In the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of his 2013 novel, A Delicate Truth, John le Carr√© thanks Ross for \\"his example demonstrat[ing] the perils of speaking a delicate truth to power.\\" In 2017, BBC4 broadcast a documentary about Ross's life and ideas called The Accidental Anarchist. The documentary charts Ross's change from a civil servant in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to an anarchist. The linguist, cognitive scientist and political activist Noam Chomsky appears in the documentary. Ross explores the philosophy of democratic confederalism developed by Abdullah √ñcalan and its influence on Kurdish groups in the Syrian Civil War such as the YPG and YPJ. Ross sees these groups as anarchist.  Private life  Ross is the grandson of linguist and academic Alan S. C. Ross.

The three acts occur, respectively, shortly before, during, and shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. The play is mostly written in English, but has several passages in Romanian, including having the cast sing Romania's national anthem, \\"De≈üteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne!\\". The title alludes to a passage in A Concise History of Romania by Andrei O≈£etea and Andrew MacKenzie that says that Bucharest stands on land that used to be an impenetrable forest \\"impenetrable by the foreigner who did not know the paths\\", known to \\"the horsemen of the steppe\\" as \\"Teleorman ‚Äî Mad Forest\\" (see Codrii VlƒÉsiei). The play The first act (\\"Lucia's Wedding\\") and the third act (\\"Florina's Wedding) are dramatic fictions. The second act (\\"December\\") is based on interviews conducted by the playwright, a director, and ten Romanian student actors.Program, production of Mad Forest at the Penthouse Theater, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, February‚ÄìMarch 2007. The first act is set in Communist Romania, several months before the Revolution, and establishes an atmosphere permeated by the Securitate (Romania's secret police), in which one young woman's engagement to an American draws scrutiny on all of her family and associates. The second act‚Äîusing the same actors to portray an entirely different set of characters‚Äîrecounts the events of December 21-December 25, 1989 in Bucharest. The third act, set largely in a hospital where one of the characters from Act I is recovering from injuries sustained during the fighting engage matters such as Romanian perceptions of the Hungarian minority and many conflicting views as the extent to which the events December 1989 and the rise of Ion Iliescu constituted a coup d'√©tat versus a revolution. While much of the play is naturalistic, it also includes several surreal passages: minor characters include an angel, a vampire, and a ghost. Frank Rich remarks that the \\"conventional political satire\\" in the early part of the play is later overwhelmed by \\"a more surreal form of theater\\": it introduces a vampire; an archangel, who collaborated with the fascist Iron Guard in the 1930s, questions (initially through the vehicle of a paranoid character, but later through others) whether what occurred in Romania was a revolution or a putsch; and finally ends in \\"drunken revelry and sadistic, retributive violence.\\" Performance history In March 1990, commissioned by London's Central School of Speech and Drama, Caryl Churchill traveled to Bucharest with director Mark Wing-Davey and ten Speech and Drama students to research the play. They stayed with Romanian drama students and their families, and worked with about 40 Romanian drama students to develop the play. Wing-Davey even had the chance to interview a former Securitate agent, who became a character in the play. Within two months of their return to England it was in production.Gussow, Mel. \\"English Theater Quick on Political Trigger\\", The New York Times, 25 July 1990. p.

Although Churchill was already an established playwright‚Äîher plays, such as Top Girls had already played in the West End and on Broadway‚Äîit premiered on \\"a small stage in the Embassy Theatre in North London\\" performed by the Speech and Drama students. The following autumn it was staged at London's Royal Court Theatre. It had its New York City premiere November 22, 1991 at the Perry Street Theatre. The New York cast included Garret Dillahunt, Tim Blake Nelson, Jake Weber and Calista Flockhart.Rich, Frank. \\"After Ceau≈üescu, Another Kind of Terror\\", The New York Times, 5 December 1991, p. C15. Accessible online; requires registration. Critical views Mad Forest received favorable reviews, although some felt it had \\"rough edges\\". In Theatre Journal, Stanton B. Garner, Jr. lauded the second act as \\"remarkable\\" and described the play as \\"a powerful account of the confusions and ambiguities attendant upon a revolution that lacked the apparent moral and political clarity\\" of other revolutions. Garner praised Churchill's script as having \\"intelligence, craft, and energy\\". The reviewer praised Churchill for accomplished scene-shaping and gestures that are \\"richly representative of life under and in the wake of totalitarianism.\\" Frank Rich, reviewing the New York premiere, called the play \\"just as surprising, inventive and disturbing as the author's 'Top Girls' and 'Fen.'\\" There is nothing kneejerk about Mad Forest [...] a full 18 months after the London opening, the piece has not dated the way that newspaper accounts of the same history already have. ‚Ä¶ The technique of Mad Forest is elliptical and atmospheric ‚Ä¶ In Act III ‚Ä¶ paroxysms of xenophobia and paranoia ‚Ä¶ often seem even more frightening than the sullen episodes of repression that preceded them.\\" Malcolm L. Johnson of Hartford Courant lauded the work as a \\"harrowing, stirring, sometimes overpowering look at Romania\\" that \\"brings together disparate styles [...] to create political theater of truly epic proportions and revelatory meaning.\\" Johnson wrote, \\"While 'Mad Forest' sometimes works abstractly [...] ultimately this is a clear, even familiar play.\\" Anna Rosenstein of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette criticized the play as \\"disconnected\\". Rosenstein also stated that the second act, \\"a sort of living newspaper version of the revolution,\\" is weaker than the first and third acts. Charles Isherwood of Variety wrote that the surrealist scenes \\"aren‚Äôt sufficiently illuminating to justify their inclusion in an otherwise very worldly play\\", and that the play's complexities could strain audience interest. However, Isherwood also dubbed the final scene \\"a comic, appropriately cacophonous end to a play that reverberates with the profound messiness of human history.\\" Jeremy Gerard of the same magazine called Mad Forest \\"brilliant\\" in a review of a later Churchill play. BBC's Jamie Searle described the play as a \\"bold, striking\\" drama, writing that the second act of eye-witness accounts \\"gives us a powerful insight into the developing events and their impact on the people, the confusion, disbelief, hope and bravery shown against the seemingly invulnerable state machine.\\" Lyn Gardner of The Guardian quipped in 2009 that Mad Forest \\"still feels vivid and fresh\\". Chris Klimek wrote in 2011 that it captures the bedlam of a society in rapid upheaval, but also that \\"Churchill‚Äôs diversions into surrealism [...] are often clearer than the more naturalistic stretches, where even after nearly three hours, some relationships remain opaque.\\" Barbara Lounsberry of The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier wrote in 2011, \\"I wish the long Act III could be pruned. It didn't register as powerfully for me as the first two very different acts-although the post-revolution fear, paranoia, guilt, and myriad questions certainly come through.\\" Myron Meisel reviewed the play positively in The Hollywood Reporter two years later, writing (of four days important in the play's universe) that \\"Churchill remarkably does not oversimplify the action, imparting an extraordinary amount of detail with confident economy.\\" With regards to a character's discussion of possible conspiracies, Meisel argued that \\"these issues of what really happened continue unresolved nearly 25 years on, a testament to the durability of Churchill‚Äôs insights into the events.\\" Jennie Webb of Backstage stated, \\"Revolution is never black and white, and Churchill wisely dwells in uncertainty and targets the surreal nature of social and political shifts in a world where the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" However, the critic found the \\"realistic aspects\\" of Act 3 problematic because of absurdity of the questions the characters were facing. Webb wrote that Mad Forest \\"ends up being a bit drawn out and unwieldy, but it‚Äôs still well worth the trip.\\" Beth Schachter, who directed a performance of the play, said in 2014, \\"Working on that production gave me insight into what is going on underneath the words, and more importantly, underneath the silences. This play clarifies what so often goes unsaid between people in difficult situations.\\" References Category:Plays by Caryl Churchill Category:1990 plays Category:Romania in fiction Category:Works about the Romanian Revolution ","title":"Mad Forest"},{"id":"9842517","text":"Reading Youth Orchestra (RYO) is one of the oldest youth orchestras in Britain. It was formed in 1944 with just eleven members and has a history rooted strongly in the British Youth and Community Service. It is open to all young people in the general area of Reading in the English county of Berkshire; admission is by audition. The orchestra, whose members range from fourteen to nineteen years of age, meets on Friday evenings to prepare for its three annual concerts. The orchestra celebrated its 60th birthday in 2004. RYO has toured to European cities and regularly holds summer courses. Reading Youth Orchestra is supported by Friends of RYO (FRYO). History (1944‚Äì1954) Reading Youth Orchestra was founded in 1944, after the Youth Committee of the time had begun instrumental lessons for modest fees (sixpence, or 2.5p today). The conductor was Humphrey Hare, senior science master at Leighton Park and amateur musician. It had its first rehearsal on 29 October 1944, with 11 players, many of whom could not even read music. This number slowly increased, fed by pupils from Leighton Park and Kendrick Schools, and some of the teachers playing along. In March 1945, the orchestra made its debut in a small-scale concert playing simple pieces like Handel's Scipio. On 16 November 1945, the orchestra performed for the first time movements from major works in a joint concert with Reading Youth Choir. The programme included Strauss' Blue Danube waltz. In 1947, RYO went on their first tour to Zaandam in the Netherlands. The concert of February 1948 saw the premiere of a Fugue specially composed for, and dedicated to Reading Youth Orchestra by Humphrey Hare. This fugue is featured on one of the 78 RPM records recorded on 23 May at Leighton Park. On 8 August 1949, the now sixty strong orchestra went to D√ºsseldorf for a week's visit during which they gave four concerts, which were very much appreciated by local people who came to see them. The fifth anniversary concert in March 1950 marked the five years since the first concert in March 1945. In August 1950, RYO toured again to Germany. The cost to members was ¬£13.00. Five concerts were given, finishing with a return visit to D√ºsseldorf. The tour to Denmark in August 1951 was organised by RYO‚Äôs new conductor, Mark Wigram, at the Invitation of the World Friendship Association. The orchestra travelled as two separate parties. One travelled by air and had five days in Denmark before the other party arrived. The other party travelled by sea and stayed on a further five days after the air party had left. In addition to the usual sight seeing program, which included the Carlsberg breweries. The orchestra gave three concerts. The second concert was notable because part of it was broadcast on Danish National Radio. The final concert of the tour was given in the concert hall of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. Mark Wigram‚Äôs last concert with RYO, in February 1952, included the first public performance of Serenade (for small orchestra) by Richard Bennett, now Richard Rodney Bennett, who played in the percussion section of the orchestra. In 1959, at the age of 23, Bennett also composed an overture that was dedicated to Reading Youth Orchestra. This remained unplayed for many years in its full orchestral form, although it received its first public performance as part of the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1994. The concert given in June 1953 celebrated the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The tenth anniversary concert, conducted by John Russell, was held in the town hall on Friday, 16 July 1954. During the concert, Gwynneth Reed was presented with a bouquet of flowers and later a brooch after six years with the orchestra. Following the tenth anniversary concert, John Russell handed over the baton to Edward Underhill who had been deputy conductor since the early years of the orchestra‚Äôs life.

He graduated from Southeastern High School in Detroit in 1938 and attended Lawrence Institute of Technology from 1938 until 1939. He received a B.S. in Engineering from Michigan State University in 1942 and an honorary LL.D. from the same school in 1965. He was employed on airplane engine design in Detroit, 1942 and served in the United States Army Air Corps, from 1942 to 1945. He served in the Pacific Theater until discharged as a first lieutenant. A plaque located on a bridge on Interstate 75 (I-75) near Indian River contains Mackie's name on it. All state highway bridges built during Mackie's term contain a plaque similar to this. Mackie was employed by an engineering firm in the Flint area from 1946 to 1952, and organized the Flint Surveying & Engineering Co. in 1952. He was Genesee County surveyor from 1952 until 1956 and was elected State Highway Commissioner of Michigan in 1957 and reelected in 1961 to a new four-year term. Mackie was quoted as being critical of the increasing popularity of compact cars, saying, \\"They may be socially desirable in some parts of the country, but I think they are a nuisance. If they really take hold‚Äîand I don't think they will‚Äîthen it is inevitable that gas and weight taxes will have to go up, both for the federal and state government.\\" He further claimed that they not only threatened tax revenues, but were also highway hazards. Mackie's criticism's were rebuked by, George W. Romney, then the president of American Motors Corporation and leading proponent of compact cars in the United States. Mackie also aggressively expanded the system of freeways and expressways in Michigan. During most of his administration, Michigan led the nation in construction of its Interstate Highway System and was the first to build a cross-state Interstate freeway (I-94) He was president of the American Association of State Highway Officials in 1963. Mackie was elected as a Democrat from Michigan's 7th congressional district to the 89th United States Congress, serving from January 3, 1965 to January 3, 1967. He was known as one of the Michigan Five Fluke Freshmen and was defeated in 1966 by Donald W. Riegle, Jr., a Republican. He was subsequently a business owner and a resident of Warrenton, Virginia. Mackie died on March 5, 2008 after an extended illness. The welcome center located on the median of US 127 and US 10 in Clare, Michigan, is named in his honor.

The college officially became an Academy in September 2011. The academy has two campuses, the Thorpe Campus in Thorpe-le-Soken, and Frinton Campus situated in Frinton-on-Sea. This is the largest distance between two campuses of the same secondary school in the United Kingdom (with the distance reaching just over 5 miles). Key Stage 3 (Years 7 to 9) are located in Thorpe-le-Soken, and Key Stage 4 (Years 10 to 11) and Sixth Form are at the Frinton Campus. Tendring Technology College currently has over 1900 pupils on roll, split between the two sites. The school is sponsored by the Academies Enterprise Trust. The Academy was previously led by Mike Watson, however in 2004, he went into early retirement after twenty years at the school, and was replaced by Caroline Hayes.http://archive.echo- news.co.uk/2004/7/20/127971.html Caroline Hayes remained Principal of Tendring Technology College for 12 Years before stepping down in 2016, to be replaced by the current Principal, Michael Muldoon. The Academy saw extensive building work at its Frinton Campus in 2003 when new departmental buildings were erected. One of these new buildings, the Watson building, was named after former Principal Michael Watson and is currently occupied by the performing arts department. After a long battle the Academy secured the funding for a ¬£2.8 million state-of-the-art Sixth Form Centre, which is based at the Frinton Campus site and reached completion in September 2011. The new building features facilities such as a media suite and social area, as well as extra teaching space. Tendring Technology College was one of only several schools to receive such finding from the Learning Schools Council. This follows previous upgrades to the Frinton Campus, which created new teaching space, a new Resources Centre and exterior improvements. Much like the Smoot at MIT the school has developed its own unit of length. The 'Mbrown' it is named after ex-student Mitchell Brown and is equivalent to 1.78meters. The unit came to be after Mitchell Brown was used by his friends to mark out a football pitch on the school field. A football pitch is 58.9 Mbrown's by 38.2 Mbrown's (105meteres by 68meters). The Academy's Business Studies department is part of the Young Enterprise scheme, and for this, there are several academy productions put on every year such as talent shows and karaokes. The Sixth Form also have their annual Sixth Form Revue, which is a collection of sketches shown live on projected video. There is also a tradition that a student band performs at each show. The Revue is typically held on the last day before the academy closes for Christmas. The Young Enterprise scheme has been praised as a success and regularly reach the finals of the competition. The Academy's performing arts department has also put on several productions in recent years, such as Little Shop of Horrors, The Tempest, The Lion Witch and Wardrobe, Macbeth, Jerry Springer The Opera, and the most recent Rock of Ages (2019).

As an early orientalist, Arabist and linguist, he translated Arabic texts into Latin and took possession of the Grotto of Nazareth for the Franciscan order in 1620. Journey to Nazareth In 1620 Fra Obicini's travelled to Jerusalem to the Emir of Beirut, Fakhr ad-Din II. The background to this mission began seven years earlier, in 1613, when Fakhr ad- Din II had taken refuge in Tuscany, Italy. The emir formed an alliance with the Medici ruler, Cosimo II, and spent two years under his protection. He spent three more in Sicily and Naples seeking, and failing, to rally a Crusade against Ottoman rule. By 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to Lebanon. Two years later Friar Obicini journeyed to Jerusalem in an embassy with Lord Battista Tarquet, the Consul of all Palestine, sent by the consul of Sidon, the Christian King, Lord Albert Gardana and the Prosecutor of the Holy Land, Lord Francis Lebar. In Beirut, Obicini was, according to his account, warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-Din, who had readily granted the two Christian holy sites, the Grotto of the Annunciation, i.e. the Grotto of Nazareth, and Mount Tabor to his Franciscan order. In his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to Nazareth, as a small group of a priest, friar John of Vend√¥me, and a Sicilian friar, Francesco Salice, had brought letters from the Princes, various testimonials, and a decree from the Qadi of Safed. On Saturday 29 November 1620, the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the House of Loreto and known as the Holy Grotto - the site venerated by Christians as the place where the Angel Gabriel announced the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary.Riedizione e traduzione degli opuscoli di Tommaso Obicini da Novara sulle processioni nei Luoghi Santi e sull‚Äôacquisto dei santuari di Nazaret e Ain Karem (1623) While Obicini was abbot in the convent of Aleppo, Syria he had mastered Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Coptic languages. In 1621, he was the first lector in Arabic in the San Pietro in Montorio convent and was a precursor of Athanasius Kircher. In 1631 Obicini published Grammatica Arabica; a Latin translation of the 13th-14th century Arabic grammar , (),Matn Al Ajrumiyyah by Ab≈´ Abdullaahi Muhammad bin Muhammad bin DƒÅw≈´d a·π£-·π¢anhaajƒ´, known as Ibn Adjurrum.

She is a graduate of Spelman College, the University of Iowa, and Arizona State University. She is currently a member of the English faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences at Emory University, and recently returned to her hometown after a decade in New York City. Jones was appointed an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-large at Cornell University (effective July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2025). Early life Jones was raised in Cascade Heights, Atlanta, by her parents Mack and Barbara Jones who both participated in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. They went on to gain PhDs in social sciences and became professors at Clark College. Her father taught political science at Atlanta University while her mother taught economics at Clark College. She recalls growing up following the civil rights movement and becoming acutely aware of her race after being given books featuring black children and playing with black dolls. Jones, whose name means 'she is prepared' in Swahili, has two brothers and two half-sisters from a previous marriage of her father's. Jones and her sisters were raised apart and they served as inspiration for Jones' novel Silver Sparrow. Jones grew up during the Atlanta Child Murders (she was eight when the murders began) and describes it as \\"the most significant event of my childhood.\\" Two of her classmates at Oglethorpe Elementary were killed: Yusuf Bell and Terry Pue. Camille Bell, the mother of Yusuf Bell would later help organize the Committee To Stop Children's Murders in response to the murders. Jones' experience growing up during this time would serve as inspiration for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Education After graduating from Benjamin Mays High School, Jones attended Spelman College, a historically black women's college in Atlanta. Jones' desire to be a writer was fostered at Spelman by influential mentors and her reading of authors that would shape her world view and inspire her own personal expression. She studied with Pearl Cleage, who after graduating from Spelman in 1971 joined the faculty as a writer and playwright in residence. As a sixteen-year-old self-described \\"little whippersnapper,\\" Jones attended arts gathering at Cleage's house dubbed \\"Live At Club Zebra\\". These gatherings inspired Jones' desire to pursue an artistic life. Johnetta Cole, the first black female President of Spelman, also served as a role model for Jones: \\"The day I arrived on campus as a first-year student was the day that our Sister President, Johnnetta B. Cole, stepped into her historic position. Before this, I don‚Äôt think I had ever seen a black woman in a significant leadership position. I had never considered that possibility.\\" It was also at Spelman that Jones first read Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon: 'in college I started to see that so many of the theories of power I understood about race also applied to gender. It changed me. I would never be the same. And Song of Solomon was a big part of that epiphany.\\" Jones graduated from Spelman in 1991 and went on to complete a master's degree in English from the University of Iowa in 1994 and a Master of Fine Arts in fiction from Arizona State University in 2000. She has received many fellowships, including from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the Radcliffe Institute, and United States Artists.  Genre and style  A major theme in Jones' writing is family, as seen in Leaving Atlanta, The Untelling and An American Marriage. Her novels portray the relationships between parents and their children, along with that of married couples. Tina McElroy Ansa has written about the success that Jones has found in accurately portraying the character of families. Jones' novels portray African-American experiences in the Southern United States, specifically how their lives are impacted by the unjust systems they live in. Leaving Atlanta portrays how the black community of Atlanta was failed by its government during the Atlanta Child Murders of 1979-81, and the novel ends with no justice served. An American Marriage was written as a result of Jones researching the problems surrounding mass incarceration in the United States, and its impact on black men and women. Jones has spoken about Toni Morrison's influence on her work, specifically Song of Solomon for its portrayal of the black middle-class and characterization of female characters. Books Jones's first novel, Leaving Atlanta, is a three-voiced coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of the Atlanta Child Murders of 1979‚Äì81. This novel, which was written while she was a graduate student at Arizona State University, is based on her experience as a child in Atlanta during that period. It won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Aletha Spann of 30Nineteen Productions has purchased the film option for Leaving Atlanta. The Untelling is also set in Atlanta. Described in Publishers Weekly as Jones's \\"deep-felt second novel\\", the book examines how the protagonist comes to terms with the loss of key members of her family as a child before having to redefine herself all over again in her mid-twenties. It was awarded the Lillian Smith Book Award in 2005.\\"2005 Winners\\", Lillian Smith Book Awards, University of Georgia Libraries. Silver Sparrow, Jones's third novel, was published by Algonquin Books in 2011. It was an American Booksellers Association number 1 \\"Indie Next\\" pick. An American Marriage, her latest novel, was published on February 6, 2018 by Algonquin. On the same day, Oprah Winfrey announced that An American Marriage would be a pick of Oprah's Book Club.Italie, Hillel, \\"Winfrey picks novel 'An American Marriage' for book club\\", ABC News, February 6, 2018. An American Marriage is about an African-American couple whose lives are shaken when the husband is arrested for a crime he did not commit. Winfrey has also announced that she is producing a film adaptation of the book. President Barack Obama included An American Marriage on his summer 2018 reading list. Jones also edited Atlanta Noir, an anthology of noir fiction published by Akashic Books in 2017. Jones' short story, Caramel, takes place in the Cascade Heights neighborhood of southwest Atlanta. Caramel is one of fourteen stories in the anthology that are set in Atlanta neighborhoods. Atlanta Noir is a collection of stories that Jones gathered to reveal the cruel reality of some of the major issues of Atlanta. Brennan Collins from Georgia State University explains, in the Atlanta Studies website, what Jones' use of the word 'rot' in ‚Äúexposing the rot underneath the scent of magnolia and pine‚Äù (Jones p.15) are \\"Atlanta's versions of gentrification, the suburbs, traffic, and inequality.\\" Bibliography * Leaving Atlanta, Warner Books, 2002, * The Untelling, Warner Books, 2005, * Silver Sparrow, Algonquin Books, 2011, * Atlanta Noir (ed.), Akashic Books, 2017, * An American Marriage, Algonquin Books, 2018, , Honors and awards Jones is a recipient of the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction, Lifetime Achievement Award in Fine Arts from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, United States Artist Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and Radcliffe Institute Bunting Fellowship.

It was directed by Angelina Maccarone and stars Jasmin Tabatabai, Anneke Kim Sarnau, and Nav√≠d Akhavan. Its English title is Unveiled. Background Writers Maccarone and Judith Kaufmann conceived the idea for the film in 1998. In 2002, Maccarone sent a copy of the script to actress Tabatabai, who reviewed it. As an Iranian, Tabatabai worked with Maccarone and Kaufmann to rewrite the story to be more realistic. For example, the main character became \\"more subtle, not as outspoken.\\" Maccarone describes her aspirations and ideas for the film in an interview with AfterEllen.com. One of the issues she wished to contradict was the idea of humanity being split into 'good' and 'evil.' She states, \\"I believe the world, the human, is more complex than that. The simple solutions that are suggested by polarities are dangerous. Thinking like \\"we are good, they are evil\\" has existed for a long time and justified a lot of horrible things people do to each other.\\" Maccarone has also described her desire to use the film to act as a commentary on the discrimination that queer people face. Drawing that homosexuals often have to defend their identities in ways that heterosexuals do not, the film acts as insight in how majorities define what is \\"normal.\\" Plot summary The translator Fariba Tabrizi (29, played by Jasmin Tabatabai) is living under the threat of the death penalty in her own country Iran after being revealed, by the vice squad, to be homosexual. With some support from a relative, Fariba is able to flee from her home country to Germany. When she is in the refugee detention centre at Frankfurt Airport her application for asylum is turned down. She lives hour by hour with the thought in mind that she may be deported. Her desperate prospects are dramatically improved by the suicide of a fellow-inmate also from Iran she assumes his identity and, as Siamak Mustafai, and using his temporary permit of sojourn, is re-located to the provinces of Swabia. Fariba knows Germany only from literature and from her work as a translator which leave her in no way prepared for the likes of Sielmingen. The contrast to a metropolis such as Teheran could scarcely be greater. At first glance her survival seems to be assured. However, in the refugee home she is obliged to uphold her male disguise in cramped quarters and she is not permitted to leave the Regional District of Esslingen. A single word wrong, any attempt at contact is allied for her with the danger of her cover being blown. The only way to escape from this predicament is by means of forged documents. To do this she is in urgent need of money. With a little help from her roommate Gasmut she comes into contact with L√§chle (30), the local godfather. He is instrumental in procuring an illegal, seasonal job for her in a sauerkraut processing factory right in the middle of a complex hick town coterie. Anne (26) is manoeuvred by her workmates into taking on a bet. She will get a bike for her son if she can manage to get a date with the refugee chap. Uwe (29) finds it totally out of order that Anne is so solicitous about Siamak's well-being. His worries are not entirely unfounded, since Anne derives some kind of pleasure from the strange foreigner. Under any other circumstances Fariba would have been only too glad to respond to Anne's advances, however she is afraid on account of the whole business of the Siamak facade. With great stubbornness Anne drags Siamak along to the boozy leisure activities of her little hick town clique. In the process they become dangerously close and Anne begins to get wind of Fariba's true identity. When Siamak's permit of sojourn runs out Fariba gets into arrears with the instalments for her documents. It becomes clear to her that she will never manage things on her own. She risks everything and takes Anne into her confidence. She wants at long last to be able to live as a woman again, to live out her profession, to enjoy big cities. To break away from the provinces would also be the fulfilment of a dream for Anne. She does not disappoint Fariba. Together they successfully go in for car theft. Fariba gets her new passport. The world is their oyster. Just as Fariba is changing out of her Siamak disguise Uwe and the clique turn up in Anne's flat. Uwe demands an explanation. The row escalates. The noisy dispute leads to Fariba's downfall. During the routine check on account of disturbance of the falsified passport falls into the hands of the police. The system which she believed she had outwitted takes its relentless grip. Fariba knows: this is the end, her hopes are shattered. Anne has to watch on helplessly as Fariba is put under arrest. The term \\"in orbit\\" is officially used by the UN to refer to asylum-seekers who find themselves orbiting around planet Earth because they can actually find legal domicile nowhere at all. Title The original German title translates as \\"stranger's skin.\\" Maccarone said, The English title, Unveiled, was conceived by the U.S. distributor of the film.

Perry, FBA (; born 9 September 1948) is an American scholar of Chinese politics and history at Harvard University, where she is the Henry Rosovsky Professor of Government and Director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. She is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, and served as Director of Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research from 1999 to 2003 and as President of the Association for Asian Studies in 2007.  Life and career  Perry was born in Shanghai, shortly before the Chinese Communist Revolution, to American missionary parents who were professors at St. John's University. She grew up in Tokyo, Japan in the 1950s and participated in the 1960 Anpo protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty. She returned to the United States and attended William Smith College, where she earned her B.A. summa cum laude in 1969. In 1978, she received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan where her dissertation advisors included Michel Oksenberg, Norma Diamond, Albert Feuerwerker, and Allen Whiting. Her doctoral thesis explored the tradition of peasant rebellions of the Huaibei region of North China and the Communist Revolution. Perry took her first teaching job at the University of Arizona before becoming an assistant, then associate professor at the University of Washington (1978-1990); she the taught at the University of California, Berkeley as Robson Professor of Political Science, 1990-1997 before moving to Harvard. When China and the US resumed academic exchange in 1979, she spent a year at Nanjing University as a visiting scholar, researching Chinese secret societies under Cai Shaoqing and the Taiping Rebellion under . Scholarship and changing views Perry's research focuses on the history of the Chinese revolution and its implications for contemporary politics. Although she earned all her degrees in political science, much of her research focuses on history and its links to contemporary issues. She observes that contemporary China consciously sees itself as an outgrowth of its long history, and Chinese political leaders are keenly aware of history, even if they may misunderstand it. As a result, history is highly consequential in the study of contemporary politics. She had been sympathetic with the Cultural Revolution as a student, and joined the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, a group that opposed American involvement in the Vietnam War. After witnessing the inequality in Communist China and hearing people's personal accounts about their suffering during the period, her views on the Chinese revolution and Maoism changed fundamentally.  Selected honors  Her book, Shanghai on Strike: the Politics of Chinese Labor (1993) won the John K. Fairbank Prize from the American Historical Association. Her article \\"From Mencius to Mao ‚Äì and Now: Chinese Conceptions of Socioeconomic Rights\\" (2008) won the Heinz Eulau Prize from the American Political Science Association. Perry received honorary doctorate degrees from Hobart and William Smith Colleges and from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The Asian Studies Library at her undergraduate alma mater has been named in her honor. She also holds honorary professorships at eight major Chinese universities.

He had a voice of enormous proportions and is most remembered for his association with the music dramas of Richard Wagner, especially the Ring Cycle, The Mastersingers of Nuremberg and Parsifal. Born in Rotterdam, van Rooy studied with the famous voice teacher Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt. He made his operatic debut at the Bayreuth Festival in 1897, singing Wotan in Der Ring des Nibelungen. The year 1898 saw his debuts in Berlin and at the Royal Opera House in London; and on 14 December that same year he sang for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, as Wotan in Die Walk√ºre. He remained with the Met until 1908, during which time he was heard in all the leading baritone Wagnerian roles. Most notably, he created Amfortas in the American premiere of Parsifal in 1903. Four years later, he created the part of John the Baptist in the initial New York production of Richard Strauss's then controversial opera, Salome. Van Rooy also continued to sing regularly at Bayreuth until 1903, when he was banned by Cosima Wagner from any further performances at the festival, because the Met performances of Parsifal that he had participated in breached German copyright law. His appearances in London spanned the years 1898-1913. He made gramophone discs and cylinder recordings, too, and was a noted song recitalist and soloist in oratorio. Although the acoustically recorded discs and cylinders that van Rooy cut during the early 1900s were incapable of capturing the full majesty of his voice, they do demonstrate the strength of his high notes, the dark beauty of his tone and the sensitivity of his phrasing. They show why, to quote the Oxford Dictionary of Opera (second edition), \\"he was considered the finest [Hans] Sachs, Kurwenal and Wotan of the first decade\\" of the 20th century. (Some of his recordings are available on CD reissues.) After leaving the Metropolitan Opera, van Rooy became the leading Wagnerian baritone of the Frankfurt Opera; but by this juncture his voice had deteriorated prematurely due to vigorous over-use and his willingness to sing roles with a higher range than was ideal for his sonorous instrument. Anton van Rooy died in Munich in 1932, at the age of 62. Notes References and further reading * David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition.

It attempted to reform the Czech Government and establish a democracy in response to the Hilsner Trial. Following the Hilsner Trial, Masaryk became a key point of controversy and ultimately he felt that he needed to break from the Young Czechs and the Old Czechs. This led to the creation of the Czech Realist Party.  Founding  Tom√°≈° Masaryk was a key figure in the creation of the Czech Realist Party. He believed in a liberal democracy and his beliefs got him voted into the Bohemian Diet and Reichsrat (Austrian Parliament) in 1891.William Mahoney, The History of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, (2011), 123-4. However, his time in politics was short lived and he resigned in 1893 after martial law was imposed in Prague when protests broke out in 1893. Although he gained support through his time in office, his role in the Hilsner Affair had a much larger effect on his role in creating the Czech Realist Party. The Hilsner Affair became a focal point of controversy in Czech history in 1899 and 1900, and this affair ultimately led to Masaryk‚Äôs creation of the Czech Realist Party. Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagrant, was accused of murdering Ane≈æka Hr≈Øzov√°, a Czech Catholic girl, even though there was little substantial evidence proving his guilt. Much of the nationalist press began to portray the murder as a ritual killing in order to create anti-Semitic feeling throughout the country. Masaryk believed he should defend Hilsner so that he could demonstrate his own personal beliefs. His defense led Emperor Francis Joseph to change Hilsner‚Äôs sentence from execution to lifelong imprisonment. After Masaryk led to the lessening of Hilsner‚Äôs sentence, many Czech nationalists denounced Masaryk‚Äôs choice to defend Hilsner and his belief that ethics applied to both nationalism and personal behavior. Masaryk became more critical of both the Young Czechs and the Old Czechs which led to his break from them. Masaryk collaborated with Karel Kram√°≈ô and a few others in creating the Czech Realist Party which relatively soon after its creation merged with members of the Radical Progressive Party. The party became known as the Radical Progressive Party in 1905 but its members were still viewed as realists.  Beliefs  The Czech Realist Party was led by Thomas Masaryk who wanted not only a free, open democracyEva Schmitt-Hartmann, \\"Thomas G. Masaryk's Realism: Origins of a Czech Political Concept\\", (1984), 150. but also a unified democratic state for Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.Jorg Hirsch and Kim Travnor, http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/modhunhist_II.htm He worked alongside Edvard Bene≈° to establish the goal of a unified state, and would eventually go on to be the first president of Czechoslovakia. The Realist Party wanted equality in the workplace for women, as well as universal suffrage. It sought for the legitimate establishment of democracy as a political power in Czechoslovakia. The Young Czech Party, which eventually merged with the Realist Party, was founded in 1848 and as such it was founded on nationalist ideologies, which continued through in the realist party. This nationalist attitude is demonstrated through the movement for a unified kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. However, Masaryk has also been accused of showing slight totalitarian leanings, as he believed that one interpretation of history and vision of the future should be imposed.Eva Schmitt-Hartmann, \\"Thomas G. Masaryk's Realism: Origins of a Czech Political Concept\\", (1984), 194.

He served as a Government whip for nine years; after being defeated, he was given an hereditary peerage by the Crown. Family Hughes-Young was the son of Brigadier-General Henry Young, a Northern Ireland-born Cavalry Officer who later served as Serjeant-at-Arms for the Parliament of Northern Ireland. He was sent to Selwyn House Preparatory School in Broadstairs, and then to Harrow School; he followed his father into the Army, studying at Sandhurst. In 1932 he joined the Black Watch. Army career In 1934, Hughes-Young was attached to the French Army on an exchange programme; in 1935 he was seconded to the King's African Rifles. On the outbreak of the Second World War he married Elizabeth Blakiston-Houston, also from Northern Ireland. He fought against Italy in Abyssinia, and later returned to Britain where he participated in the invasion of Europe; he was wounded twice and won the Military Cross. Politics Hughes-Young left the army, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, in 1947, and settled in Englefield Green in Surrey. He became an official of Conservative Central Office in the publicity department. At the 1951 general election, he fought St Helens against Hartley Shawcross, the President of the Board of Trade in the Labour government; this was a safe Labour constituency but it gave Hughes-Young much experience of fighting an election campaign. Election to Parliament Prior to the 1955 general election Hughes-Young was selected as Conservative candidate for Wandsworth Central, a marginal seat. The Labour incumbent Richard Adams retired and Hughes-Young beat Labour's new candidate, Patricia Llewelyn-Davies, by just over 1,000 votes. He took until December to make his maiden speech, which was in a debate on raising the level of National Assistance; he argued that many people resented receiving it because it was charity which brought shame on their family. Whip's Office Hughes-Young served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State, Board of Trade for some months in 1956. Harold Macmillan appointed Hughes-Young as an Assistant Whip when he became Prime Minister in January 1957. This silenced him in the Chamber of the House of Commons (because whips were not supposed to speak), although it was an unpaid post. In 1958 he was part of a Parliamentary delegation to the United States. He was also a member of a team of Ministers who went round the country making speeches in support of the government in September 1958. The next month, he was promoted to be a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, a paid whip's role. He had a tough fight against the same Labour opponent in the 1959 general election, but increased his majority to 1,972. He was designated as Deputy Government Chief Whip. In December 1961, he was involved in an outbreak of \\"grave disorder\\" in the Commons Chamber when he moved the closure of a debate before the Labour opposition spokesman, Patrick Gordon Walker had had chance to speak. This act provoked a lengthy dispute between the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Deputy Speaker. It did not harm his career as in March 1962 he was promoted to be Treasurer of the Household. Defeat At the 1964 general election, Hughes-Young faced another challenge from Labour, who had selected Dr David Kerr; in his election address he pointed to the fact that Labour had opposed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and asked how the local housing situation would cope without restrictions on immigration. In line with the national swing, Labour gained the constituency by 2,245 votes. Peerage Sir Alec Douglas-Home gave Hughes- Young a hereditary peerage in his resignation honours list. He took the title Baron St Helens, of St Helens in the County Palatine of Lancaster. His maiden speech on 10 March 1965 was on immigration; a month later he called for some of the commons on the outskirts of London to be used for temporary housing. He opposed the Bill to suspend the use of capital punishment. In March 1970 his elder son Patrick died from injuries received in Point to point racing. He was named in the UK Delegation to attend the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Western European Union in 1970, and introduced a debate on housing in the House of Lords that May, opposing any reductions in the rate of house building and highlighting the breaking of an election pledge by the Labour government.

The Pir√°mide de Mayo (; ), located at the hub of the Plaza de Mayo, is the oldest national monument in the City of Buenos Aires. Its construction was ordered in 1811 by the Primera Junta to celebrate the first anniversary of the May Revolution. It was renovated in 1856, under the direction of Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n. In 1912, after having undergone many modifications, it was moved 63 metres (68.9 yards) to the east, with the idea that a much larger monument would eventually be constructed around it. The monument is crowned by an allegory of Liberty, the work of the French sculptor Joseph Dubourdieu. From the ground to the peak of the statue's Phrygian cap, the Pyramid measures 18.76 metres (61.5 feet).  Inauguration  On April 5, 1811, with the approval of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, it was decided that the program of festivities commemorating the first anniversary of the Revoluci√≥n de Mayo would include the construction of a pyramid. History does not record why a pyramidal form was chosen for the monument. Some speculate that it was an attempt to emulate the pyramids carved into the pillars of Paris' Porte Saint-Denis, to which the Pir√°mide de Mayo bears some resemblance. Since 1763 the Plaza de Mayo had been divided by the Vieja Recova (Old Arcade) into two smaller plazas: the one facing the eventual site of the Casa Rosada was known as the Plazoleta del Fuerte, and the one facing the Cabildo was known as the Plaza de la Victoria. The pyramid was situated in the center of the latter. At the insistence of architect Pedro Vicente Ca√±ete and Juan Gaspar Hern√°ndez, professor of sculpture at the University of Valladolid, it was decided that the monument would be constructed entirely out of solid materials, including 500 bricks, rather than out of wood, as had been planned originally. On April 6, the cement was poured to form the foundation, amid music and raucous celebration. Fredericks The Pyramid in the middle of the Plaza de la Victoria (1867). The old arcade is visible. The monument was inaugurated as planned on National Day, despite the fact that Ca√±ete had failed to meet the schedule and would not complete construction for several days. The pyramid was festooned with the banners of various illustrious regiments who had formed the garrison of Buenos Aires, including the patricians, highlanders, mulattoes and blacks, gunners, hussars, and grenadiers. The Pyramid as well as the Cathedral were heavily illuminated. The Recova was illuminated with 1,141 tallow candles. The festivities lasted four days and included dancing, raffles, and the manumission of slaves. Although Ca√±ete's original plans were lost, studies later determined that the Pyramid had been left hollow, rather than filled with masonry, in order to save time. It was made of baked adobe and stood thirteen metres tall, not including its pedestal. A platform supported its pediment, which was built on top of two grades. It had a simple quadrilateral pedestal and a floating cornice that extended around the entire structure. It was crowned by a decorative globe. The edifice was surrounded by a railing supported by twelve pillars, each terminating in a rounded knob. At each of the fence's four corners was a pointed pole from which lanterns were hung. On national holidays the Pyramid was decorated with banners, bunting, paper lanterns, and inscriptions. In 1826 president Bernardino Rivadavia announced plans to erect a monument to the Revoluci√≥n de Mayo which would consist of a magnificent bronze fountain \\"in place of what exists today\\". It was debated whether the new monument should replace the Pyramid. In any case, due to Rivadavia's resignation the following year, the project was never carried out, despite the fact that it had been approved by the legislature. In 1852 the Jaunet brothers illuminated the Pyramid with gas, using a small gasometer. The public, accustomed to the small oil lanterns, was awestruck by the effect.  The Renovation  Navigation Industry Geography Astronomy By 1856 the museum had fallen into disrepair. The painter and architect Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n was charged with the restoration. He set out to transform the monument into something more artistic and grandiose. The modern pyramid was built directly over the old, which was covered in bricks and masonry to form a suitable foundation for the new additions. The top of the statue was furnished with an allegory of Liberty, crowned with a Phrygian cap. This statue, standing 3.6 metres, was created by the French sculptor Joseph Dubourdieu from a combination of materials. Dubourdieu was also responsible for four other allegories, Industry, Commerce, The Sciences and The Arts, which were placed at the four corners of the pedestal. The eastern face of the obelisk was adorned with a golden sun, which now faces toward the Casa Rosada. The remaining three sides are decorated with crowns of laurels in alto-relievo. Pueyrred√≥n also modified the original pedestal and capital, increasing their height and breadth. Each of the four sides of the base was adorned with the national arms. A new fence was constructed and a gaslight placed at each corner. In 1859, the deteriorating condition of the plaster led the city to reface the base in marble. By 1873 the stucco and terracotta statues installed by Dubourdieu had not surprisingly begun to decay. Consequently, they were replaced with four Carrara marble statues which had originally been located on the first floor of the Banco Provincia on Calle San Mart√≠n. These were Geography, Astronomy, Navigation and Industry. These remained until 1912, when they were placed in storage. In 1972 they were installed -- and remain to this day -- in the old Plazoleta de San Francisco, at the intersection of Calles Defensa and Alsina, 150 metres from the modern Pyramid. In 1883, on the orders of intendente de la ciudad de Buenos Aires Torcuato de Alvear, the Recova was demolished, joining the Plazoleta del Fuerte and the Plaza del Victoria to form the modern Plaza de Mayo. Alvear had considered demolishing the Pyramid and erecting a more grandiose monument in its place, but in order to do so, required the permission of the deliberative council in charge of the project. The council consulted the opinion of various distinguished citizens, including ex-presidents Bartolom√© Mitre, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Nicol√°s Avellaneda. Mitre saw no reason to preserve the monument, because after its many renovations and additions it was no longer, in an authentic sense, the original Pyramid erected following the Revolution. He considered only the foundation worthy of preservation. Sarmiento also rejected the additions to the primitive structure. Avellaneda felt it should be restored to its original form and stripped of its more recent adornments, but not destroyed outright. In the end, none of these suggestions were acted upon, because although the majority favored demolition, the national government preferred the status quo. Statue of Liberty at the top of the May Pyramid, inaugurated in 1856  The Relocation  In 1906, with a few years until the centenary of the May Revolution, plans were put forward for a new monument that would completely contain the Pyramid, which consequently had to be relocated to the center of the Plaza de Mayo. This was not realized until 1912. After the marble statues had been removed, the Pyramid was enclosed with wood for protection. Two rails were laid, four metres apart, supported by masonry pillars that could support a weight of 225 metric tons. Under the Pyramid was a cement platform resting on solid wheels. Between November 12 and 20, the Pyramid was pulled 63.17 metres with a winch. A metal time capsule containing information about the relocation was buried under the Pyramid's new foundation. Despite the success of the move, the project to surround the Pyramid with a larger monument never materialized. Many remained hopeful that the Pyramid would be restored to its historical origins, including the return of the steps and railing, and the removal of the \\"shell of stucco and inappropriate figures\\". However, later resolutions limited further reforms to ground level. The foundation was repainted and the arms restored to their 1813 condition. The original railing was, ultimately, restored. Decree 120.412, issued May 21, 1942, declared the Pyramid a historical monument. Law 1.653, passed by the legislature of the city of Buenos Aires on March 10, 2005, conferred the status of a historical site on the area surrounding the Pyramid, which is notable for sidewalk paintings of shawls representing the Madres de Plaza de Mayo. On December 8 of that year, at the request of her children, the ashes of the organization's founder, Azucena Villaflor, were buried at the base of the Pyramid, where she had organized her first protest.  The Commemorative Plaque  On the west side of the Pyramid is a bronze plaque, 85 cm wide and 57 cm high, on which two names are inscribed: Felipe Pereyra de Lucena and Manuel Artigas. These names, unknown to most who visit the Pyramid, were added to the monument in 1891 during the presidency of Carlos Pellegrini, in recognition of the first two military officers to lose their lives in the cause of Argentine independence: *Manuel Artigas was the brother of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, the caudillo of the Banda Oriental, which was later to become Uruguay. Born in Montevideo in 1774, Manuel Artigas belonged to a revolutionary group which also included Domingo French and Antonio Beruti. He distinguished himself during the Paraguayan campaign of 1811, and was noted for his heroism at the Battle of Campichuelo. He was wounded on April 25 and died May 24 at the age of 33. *212x212pxFelipe Pereyra de Lucena was born in 1789 and served as a cadet during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. By the May Revolution he was already a lieutenant, having attained this rank during the campaign of Upper Peru. In 1811 he was promoted to captain. He was wounded in what is today Bolivia and transported to the settlement of Jes√∫s Machaca, where he died on June 20 at the age of 22. The news of these two casualties was met with shock, in response to which the government junta resolved to record the officers' names in bronze. However, due to lack of funds, the project was suspended. Pereyra's father petitioned the government in 1812, to no avail. In 1856, relatives of Pereyra once more appealed for the plaque's creation, but no action was taken. In 1891, the necessary funds were raised through popular subscription, and the plaque was installed on May 24 of that year.

History  = Origins (1999-2002) = The band was formed by two childhood friends Josh Kellam and Todd Mackey. Jeremy Kellam joined the band to play bass after the dissolution of his former band, which also included Casey McCue who played second guitar for a short period and was then replaced by Jason DiNitto. The band played many concerts throughout the Northeastern United States, quickly garnering acclaim and a rapidly multiplying fan-base. The band stayed a four piece for some time. At that time they befriended a band called Solace from New York, with whom they released a split CD entitled The Heart and Flesh Cry Out. The musical style of the band at that time far more influenced by metalcore than their later material. Todd who later played guitar for the band, played drums in this incarnation. = The Sun Rises and the Sun Sets... and Still Our Time is Endless (2002-2006) = Jay exited the band and after a short hiatus, Todd transitioned to guitar and the band recruited John Young to take his place as drummer. They also added Andrew Bradley as second guitarist. The hiatus and the line-up changes sparked a dramatic stylistic transformation, which was sonically captured on the four song demo entitled 'All These Things Tie Me Down'. Released in 2002 the sharp contrast of the demo with their earlier split CD only further fanned the flames of their popularity. The demo attracted Indianola Records, who signed the band, and released their first two full-length records. The first, The Sun Rises and the Sun Sets... and Still Our Time is Endless, which was released in 2003, and their second, Ignite and Rebuild, which was released in 2005. The latter was also released in the Christian Market by Floodgate Records, and in Europe by Guideline Records. = Member changes, and Waking Giants (2006-2008) = After the recording of The Sun Rises and the Sun Sets..., Todd left the band to pursue an opportunity singing for the band With Honor. He was replaced for a short time by the former guitarist of the band Solace, Mike Saracino. Several tours into promoting the record, John Young left the band, and not long after Andrew Bradley left as well. The band went on a hiatus due to the lack of sufficient band members and started holding auditions for replacements. They chose a drummer, John Gaskill, a resident of Virginia, and also recruited two local guitarists from the defunct rock band October War, Dave Swanson and James Allen. Once their contract with Indianola Records expired, the band signed with Solid State Records in June 2006. Their first, and only full-length record for Solid State Records entitled Waking Giants, was produced by Garth Richardson, and released on March 6, 2007. Shortly after the release of Waking Giants, guitarist Dave Swanson left the band to play guitar for Texas-based electro-pop-rock band PlayRadioPlay!, and not long after, was followed by James Allen. To replace the two departed guitarists, the band rejoined with former guitarist Todd Mackey, and recruited Corey Stroffolino of the fellow Connecticut band, The Risk Taken. = Disbanding (2008-2011) = The band was set to play its final concert at the Heirloom Arts Theatre in Danbury, Connecticut on July 12, 2008, to a sold-out crowd, reuniting with several former members who played with the band in a revolving line-up at the concert. Due to the sell-out, the band reunited for a concert not long after on December 20, 2008. At this concert the band performed alongside Wrench in the Works, The Risk Taken, Our Final Say, and With Honor, who had also reunited for the concert. = Reformation and Kingdoms (2011-2016) = On February 11, 2011 the band announced they had reformed, and while several former members returned to the band, John Gaskill was succeeded by Andy Nelson formerly of the band Wrench in the Works as drummer. The band stated they would be releasing a new record entitled 'Kingdoms', and later clarified through a Twitter post that Kingdoms will not be traditional full-length album, but rather will be released successively as three EPs which will be entitled The Kingdom of Man, The Kingdom of Darkness and The Kingdom of God which was released on Come&Live;! Records for free in 2011. The band opened a Kickstarter campaign for fans to help raise money for the record, and the project met the projected goal of $12,500 in 3 days, 7 hours with 304 backers according to the band members' facebook posts. The band's comeback show was July 16, 2011 at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut. =Upcoming (2016-present)= After Kingdoms was released, the band remained inactive. On May 26, 2016, the band released a video saying \\"Life in Your Way 2017\\", hinting at new shows and music. The band is due to play Souled Out Festival. The band is due to release their fifth album in 2017.

Early years  Urn-grave, P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris Born in Manhattan, New York City, van Zandt was the daughter of Jennie van Zandt, who had sung at La Scala and at New York's Academy of Music. She studied in Milan with Francesco Lamperti, making her debut as Zerlina in Don Giovanni in Turin in 1879. Career Successful appearances followed her debut, including at Covent Garden in 1879. However, at that time, it was necessary to make official debuts in Paris. So she left for Paris in 1880 where her mother, who had acquaintances in Parisian high society, managed to introduce her daughter to professionals. Van Zandt, who was only 21, signed a contract with the Op√©ra-Comique in 1880, making her debut as Mignon. L√©o Delibes composed his opera Lakm√© for her, and she created the title role for its world premiere in 1883. Organized opposition at the Op√©ra-Comique was created at around this time in an attempt to discredit her; among the false accusations\\"Marie Van Zandt\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica that were circulated was one suggesting that she appeared onstage while drunk. Nevertheless, she assumed a successful career, and the Parisian beau monde praised her, as for example Baron Alphonse de Rothschild who used to reserve loges for his family and friends when she appeared on stage. She travelled all around Europe for tours. Van Zandt made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula on December 21, 1891, remaining with the company for only one season. She returned to the Op√©ra-Comique in 1896 and revived some of her earlier success there, including Lakm√© to huge enthusiasm in 1896, and Zerlina and Mignon in 1897. It was reported that she would be appearing in March 1897 in the premiere of Massenet's Cendrillon.Stoullig E. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, 22eme edition, 1896. G Charpentier et Cie, Paris, 1897. She was a good friend of Jules Massenet and used to sing for Parisian aristocratic salons, for example at Mme Lemaire's h√¥tel particulier, where Massenet, Marcel Proust, Countess Greffulhe, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Reynaldo Hahn, etc. were frequent guests.Marcel Proust: The Salon of Mme Lemaire, 1903 She married a Russian Count and went into retirement, staying in France. Van Zandt died in Cannes in 1919 at age 61. Her ashes are at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. References External links * Ewen, David (1963), Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition.

He was a member of the Imperial Council, and also Cisleithanian finance minister (1898‚Äì1899). Kaizl was leading Czech liberal politician, known for his moderate attitudes and seeking of various means to strengthen autonomous position of Bohemian/Czech lands within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He served as the first Czech economics teacher at the Charles University. His close friends and collaborators were Jan Gebauer and Tom√°≈° Masaryk (who later became the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic). Early life and education Born into the family of Eduard Kaizl, controller of inland revenue, and a German speaking mother. He was the oldest of seven siblings. Schooling began in a German-language school in Rumburk, northern Bohemia. After transferring schools he was sent to his aunt in Prague. He studied German and later Czech during parochial school at the Church of Our Lady Victorious. In 1863 he began his high school studies there. He studied law at the Charles University in Prague (1871-1875), while in between the years 1874-1875 he underwent mandatory military service in the military supply corps. in Prague. He later went on to study economics at the University of Strasbourg (1877) under Gustav von Schmoller and Georg Friedrich Knapp. He would become a large proponent of the Schmoller historical method, and spread it through his writings.Two Czech Economists: Alb√≠n Br√°f and Josef Kuzl In 1879 he started as an assistant professor in economics at Charles University. He lectured both in Czech and German. Josef Kaizl, alongside Alb√≠n Br√°f, was later appointed as the first Czech economist of Charles University. In 1888 he became a full professor.kol. aut.: Kdo byl kdo v na≈°ich dƒõjin√°ch. Praha : Libri, 1993. . S. 143. (ƒçesky) Political activities  In the Imperial Council elections of 1885 he won a seat representing the Old Czechs. The party, however, broke opinions and he announced his resignation from the Council in 1887. After 1887, he collaborated closely with Tom√°≈° Masaryk on expanding the Realist philosophical movement. Though he would later become a critic of some of Masaryk's views, specifically Masaryk's belief that Czech political reform and revival had its roots in the ideals of Czech religious reformation.Battle for the Castle: The Myth of Czechoslovakia in Europe, 1914-1948 Kaizl viewed Masaryk's theory as illiberal and too religiously focused. Kaizl believed Czech national revival derived its true roots from the French and American Revolutions.Human Rights in the New Europe: Problems and Progress =Young Czech politician= In 1890 alongside other realists (including Masaryk) he joined the Young Czechs. In the same year he returned to the Imperial Council. In the 1891 election he was successfully elected to the Vienna parliament for the Young Czechs. Here he delivered a formal declaration supporting self-determination and nationalism, but this declaration was not well supported. Historian Otto Urban judges Kaizl's declarations as being a manifestation of the Young Czech's overall views, despite the more radical views that had launched the Young Czech's to prominence. Due to Kaizl's efforts, the Young Czechs professed more moderate and rational arguments. Unlike Masaryk, Kaizl became a longstanding fixture within the Young Czech party. Kaizl played a critical role in becoming a moderating force against radicalism in the Young Czech party. In 1894 he helped prepare, alongside Karel Kram√°≈ô, the Nymbursk√° Resolution. This resolution called for \\"constructive opposition\\" against \\"false radicalism\\" found in the Young Czech party.http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t76.html In 1895 Masaryk and Kaizl had a disagreement due to Masaryk's criticism of liberalism and his support of the idea that common Czech national identity is rooted from the Czech Hussites; Kaizl instead advocated for the standard European liberal ideology and nationalism. Kaizl defined the concept of phasing politics, and said that the young Czechs are temperamentally connected to the liberalism and democratization of Austria-Hungary. Substantial disagreements between Masaryk, Kaizl, and other party members led to Masaryk's resignation and his formation of the Czech Progressive Party.al. Car .: Who was who in our history . Prague: Libri, 1993. . S. 143. (Czech)Czech society from 1848 to 1918 . 429-430, 446-454 In 1896 in parliament the Badeni's voter reforms occurred, which widened the voter rights of citizens. During this election the Young Czechs splintered but Kaizl led the majority faction and in the following months was successful in elimination the radicals. In 1896, he succeeded in getting the Czech language to be recognized as an official working language within the Czech lands. In 1897 the Young Czechs became the largest parliamentary faction in Imperial council. Kaizl would see through to the end of the Young Czech's as a political party. The Young Czechs had begun to dissolve by the 1890s. Problems with the Young Czech reign: the party‚Äôs inability to win legislation adequate to satisfy rising Czech expectations and needs; government suppression of the labor and radical youth movements, with resultant curtailment of civil liberties; bitter disputes among party leaders and factions including Masaryk, Kaizl, and Kram√°≈ô; opportunistic tactics that discouraged progressive liberalism all induced the dissolution of the party.Winters, Stanley B.: \\"The Young Czech Party (1874-1914): An Appraisal.\\", Slavic Review, 1969, 426-444. =Finance minister= Starting in 1898 Josef Kaizl became the finance minister of the Austrian government under the Count Thun government, this would be the highest political position a Czech would ever hold in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under his ministership he became a proponent of the thesis that the best guarantee for a secure Czech nation would be a strong and equitable Austria. Kaizl completed regular negotiation of financial transactions between both halves of the Austria-Hungarian dual monarchy. During his ministership he appointed several qualified Czech officials,√ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950. Bd. 3 . Wien: [sn], 2003-2011. Available online. . Chapter Kaizl, Joseph (1854-1901), Politiker und National√∂konom, p. 185. (in German) who later came in use for the establishment of the new Czechoslovakian Ministry of Finance in 1918. Kaizl also made significant contributions towards the establishment of the Brno University of Technology. Later life Kaizl would remain the de facto head of the Young Czechs, and repeatedly acted as a moderating element. Kaizl would defend his seat in parliament and the Vienna Imperial Council until his death, where he would then be replaced by the deputy chair Franz Fiedler.

It envisaged a German Army attack targeting the Allied forces in eastern Belgium and Luxembourg, east of the Meuse River. Concept of the operation Herbstnebel was created as an alternative to Wacht am Rhein, Adolf Hitler's plan to seize Antwerp and bottle up all Allied forces in Belgium and the Netherlands. Model, along with all the other senior commanders involved, believed this was unachievable given Germany's limited resources at the time. Thus he devised a less ambitious scenario that would not cross the Meuse, but still deliver a sharp defeat to the Allies. Like Wacht am Rhein, Model's attack would be launched in the Ardennes sector, but would then turn north instead of continuing west and northwest. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt commanding OB West, had come up with a similar plan, Fall Martin (\\"Case Martin\\"). Von Rundstedt's plan called for a two-pronged attack instead of a single thrust, but in both plans the area of operations remained east of the Meuse. Model and von Rundstedt combined their plans to present a joint solution to Hitler, called by Model the \\"small solution\\". Hitler rejected it in favour of his \\"big solution\\", which formed the basis for the Battle of the Bulge. Confusingly, Operation Wacht am Rhein was itself renamed Herbstnebel in early December, although it remains most well known by its original name. The actual plan of attack was unchanged.

Treece wrote several juvenile historical novels, some set during the viking era, and this trilogy is regarded as among his best.Collectingbooksandmagazines.com The three novels describe the adventures of Harald Sigurdson, a Norwegian viking. He goes on three voyages, which between them are representative of the various voyages which were made by the Vikings, and which take place at different stages in his life. Viking's Dawn Harald is an adolescent who sails on a raid to Scotland. They come to grief on an island in the Hebrides. The Road to Miklagard Harald is now a young man whose father has died. He has a complicated series of adventures which takes him to a giant's treasure cave in Ireland, then Jebel Tarik (Gibraltar), then to Miklagard (the Viking's name for Constantinople) where he joins the famous Varangian Guard. Eventually Harald returns home to Norway via the great ship-portage on the Dnieper. Viking's Sunset Harald is now a mature man who enjoys a peaceful life of farming with his wife and sons. When his village is attacked, he forms a crew of vikings and pursues the raiders. The chase leads him across the Atlantic Ocean to the east coast of America. He and his crew encounter Inuit and then Native Americans. Harald's final fight takes place among the native tribes. In a great battle, it is revealed that he is a berserker. Significant scenes include the death of one of the raiders, Havlock Ingolfsson, whom Harald abandons to die on a skerry, and Harald's death at the hands of Heome, the mad handless brother of heroic Wawasha. The brothers have similarities with Loki and Balder respectively. This novel has obvious parallels with the Norse Vinland saga.

Etymology Taxonomy and systematics Mnesarchaeoidea constitutes the living sister taxon to the superfamily Hepialoidea.Within the family, there are two distinct genera, Mnesarchaea and Mnesarchella. The two are separated by differences in morphology and color. Mnesarchaea are white on the head and thorax scales while Mnesarchella have brown heads and thorax scales. There are currently 14 known species belonging to this family, four belonging to the Mnesarchaea genus and 10 to Mnesarchella. Distribution and Development The species within Mnesarchaea are all endemic species, occurring naturally only in New Zealand. Even within this single country, different species only occur in certain areas within New Zealand, no known species occur throughout the entire country. They live on a 1 year cycle, living as larvae and then reaching full maturity in the spring. Morphology and Identification The mouthparts of the adult moths are functional, unlike Hepialoidea. About seven species are not yet described, and the group is under revision by Gibbs et al. (see also Gibbs, 1979; Dugdale, 1988). Their notable traits are their small wingspan of less than 12mm and their brown bodies. The family has numerous unique physical traits including \\"wing venation with a single Rs1+2 vein; the lack of any positive wing- coupling mechanism; bilobed sternum A1 with external arms; male genitalia in which pseudoteguminal and valve plates are fused anteriorly to enclose a spacious subgenital crypt; female genitalia with unique elongate dorsal and subgenital plates, synscleritous anteriorly.\\" The members of this family share certain traits with other members of the Lepidoptera order such as \\"discrete mandibles that lack articulation or musculature; a short, coiled, functional proboscis with intrinsic muscle fibres; a primitively 3-segmented maxillary palp; functional salivary glands (as in Lophocoronidae).\\" Biology and behavior The moths are mostly day-flying. The larvae live in silken galleries among liverworts and soil detritus. See Kristensen (1999: 57-59) for more details. They tend to be active from mid Spring to early Autumn in New Zealand (October to March). Throughout the day, they are most active during daylight hours, minus times when the sun is most intense. A noticeable difference between male and females is that males are the only ones that fly to travel. Females generally lay about 32 eggs in their lifetime. Larva of the family make silk-tunnels under foliage until they reach maturity, obtaining food from the tunnel.

Biography Ruffini was born in San Benedetto Po in the Province of Mantua, and studied at the diocesan seminary of Mantua, the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Northern Italy (obtaining his licentiate in theology), and the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) (licentiate in philosophy) and Pontifical Biblical Institute (diploma to teach Biblical Science) in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 July 1910, and finished his studies in 1912. Ruffini taught at the Major Roman Seminary (1913‚Äì1930), and then the Pontifical Urbaniana University (1917‚Äì1929). Raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1925, he was appointed Secretary of the Congregation of Seminaries and Universities on 28 October 1928. Ruffini was made a Protonotary Apostolic on 15 June 1931. In 1930, Ruffini was made Prefect of Studies at the Pontifical Lateran University, of which he was named rector magnifico in the following year. Noted for his interest in science, Ruffini founded the Medical Biological Union of St. Luke, examining the relationships between Catholicism and science, in 1944. On 11 October 1945, he was named Archbishop of Palermo by Pope Pius XII. Ruffini received his episcopal consecration on the following 8 December from Giuseppe Cardinal Pizzardo, with Archbishop Francesco Duca and Bishop Domenico Menna serving as co-consecrators. Ruffini was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Sabina by Pius XII in the consistory of 18 February 1946.

US Navy bombe. The United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory (NCML) was a highly secret design and manufacturing site for code-breaking machinery located in Building 26 of the National Cash Register (NCR) company in Dayton, Ohio and operated by the United States Navy during World War II. It is now on the List of IEEE Milestones, and one of its machines is on display at the National Cryptologic Museum. The laboratory was established in 1942 by the Navy and National Cash Register Company to design and manufacture a series of code-breaking machines (\\"bombes\\") targeting German Enigma machines, based on earlier work by the British at Bletchley Park (which in turn owed something to pre-war Polish cryptanalytical work). Joseph Desch led the effort. Preliminary designs, approved in September 1942, called for a fully electronic machine to be delivered by year's end. However, these plans were soon judged infeasible, and revised plans were approved in January 1943 for an electromechanical machine, which became the US Navy bombe. These designs were proceeding in parallel with, and influenced by, British attempts to build a high-speed bombe for the German 4-rotor Enigma. Indeed, Alan Turing visited Dayton in December 1942. His reaction was far from enthusiastic: :It seems a pity for them to go out of their way to build a machine to do all this stopping if it is not necessary. I am now converted to the extent of thinking that starting from scratch on the design of a Bombe, this method is about as good as our own. The American Bombe program was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this program. Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.Quote from (March 2011). The American approach was, however, successful. The first two experimental bombes went into operation in May 1943, running in Dayton so they could be observed by their engineers. Designs for production models were completed in April, 1943, with initial operation starting in early June. All told, the laboratory constructed 121 bombes which were then employed for code-breaking in the US Navy's signals intelligence and cryptanalysis group OP-20-G in Washington, D.C.. Construction was accomplished in three shifts per day by some 600 WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), 100 Navy officers and enlisted men, and a large civilian workforce. Approximately 3,000 workers operated the bombes to produce \\"Ultra\\" decryptions of German Enigma traffic. According to a contemporary US Navy report (dated April 1944), the bombes were used on naval jobs until all daily keys had been run; then the machines were used for non-naval tasks. During the previous six months, about 45% of the bombe time had been devoted to non-naval problems carried out at the request of the British. British production and reliability problems with their own high-speed bombes had then recently led to construction of 50 additional Navy units for Army and Air Force keys. Building The building in Dayton, called Building 26 (Dayton) was an Art Deco design of Dayton firm Schenck & Williams and was located at Patterson Blvd and Stewart Street. The building was demolished by the University of Dayton in January 2008.

It first appeared in book form in the collection The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, published in hardcover by Twayne Publishers in 1953, and in paperback by Signet Books in 1971. It has also been translated into Portuguese, Dutch, and Italian. Plot summary Geophysicist Gordon Graham is a participant in the Gamanovia Project, whose mission is to increase the land area of the overpopulated twenty-second century Earth by creating new continents through the manipulation of geological forces. The project's initial goal is to raise a new land mass to be called Gamanovia around the existing Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. The name of the proposed new continent was chosen to honor fifteenth century Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama, the first European to navigate the region's waters, and for Jo√£o da Nova, who discovered Ascension Island a few years later. A sinister group concealing itself under the mask of the bogus Churchillian Society, supposedly dedicated to proving that the works of twentieth-century dramatist George Bernard Shaw were actually written by Winston Churchill, is attempting to discover the secrets of the project. The Churchillian Society's \\"cover\\" purpose is a spoof on the present-day body of thought similarly dismissing William Shakespeare's authorship of the Shakespeare plays on the grounds that he, as a commoner, could not possibly have written great literature. When Graham becomes involved with Jeru-Bhetiru, an alien woman from the country of Katai-Jhogorai on the planet Krishna, the society attempts to blackmail him into serving them by kidnapping and threatening to kill her. Instead, Graham allies himself with World Federation constable Reinhold Sklar and Jeru's fianc√© Varnipaz bad-Savarun, a diplomat from the Krishnan kingdom of Sotaspe, to thwart the plotters. The enemy is gradually revealed as a rogue band of Thothians from the Procyonic star system, hoping to seize the new continent by claiming Ascension, which currently lacks any sovereign government. Graham and his cohorts find themselves in a tight race against time, in which the labyrinthine bureaucracies of the future Earth prove almost as much an impediment as the enemy, and the hypnotic powers of the reptilian alien Osirians bring about treachery within their own ranks. An added problem for Graham is that the rescue of Jeru will gain nothing for him personally, but rather benefit only his rival Varnipaz; though Graham and Jeru love each other, people in her country wed on the basis of interest and advantage, considering love to have nothing to do with marriage.  Setting  \\"The Continent Makers\\" is set on a future Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias (\\"Interplanetary Tours\\" in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems is common, though limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives. Most reachable systems have life-bearing planets inhabited by alien races; an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples. As dated in The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens and the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories,\\" the action of \\"The Continent Makers\\" takes place in the year 2153 AD., placing it after \\"The Colorful Character\\", and making it the third Viagens story set on Earth in terms of chronology. Reception P. Schuyler Miller, in a review of the collection, observed that the reader \\"may feel cheated to find that the title story, worth about one quarter of the book, takes place back on Earth,\\" though finding its \\"various aliens\\" and \\"grand climax\\" worthy of comment.Miller, P.

Background =Early years and education= Cornelio Sommaruga was born in Rome, Italy, where his father had a professional activity as a commercial lawyer and was stationed during WWII at the Swiss embassy responsible for foreign interests. In fact, he spoke Italian long before he learned German. He was brought up by Catholic parents and remained a devout Christian throughout his life.Cornelio Sommaruga's lecture at Centre d'Etudes Catholique in Geneva on 19 November 2012 (in French) http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/other_languages/french/About_GICHD/Staff/Staff_Statements_Articles/SOC-121119-Centre- Catholique-Geneve-fr.pdf He was profoundly influenced by his early years in Rome. The period in which his father represented Liberia at the Vatican probably inspired him the most in terms of his long diplomatic and humanitarian career. Despite his connection to Rome, he has close ties with Ticino, his family's canton of origin.Article from Cl√©ment B√ºrge in the Swiss magazine l'Hebdo \\"Politique : Portrait d‚Äôune famille engag√©e\\" on 6 October 2010 (in French) He went to grammar and high school in Italy and attended university in Zurich, Switzerland, where he obtained a doctorate in law in 1957. It was only during this period that he learned German, one of the four national languages of Switzerland. He later attended the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva from which he received a diploma in 1961. =Professional career= Cornelio Sommaruga entered the Swiss diplomatic corps after working two years in the banking sector from 1957 to 1959. He served as a diplomat in The Hague, Rome, Geneva and Bern. From 1968 to 1973, he was the deputy of the Swiss delegation to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the senior representative to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), where he further developed his diplomatic and negotiating skills. From 1973 to 1975, he served as the deputy to the Secretary General of EFTA in Geneva. From there, he returned to Bern where he held senior posts at the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Swiss government, i.a. as Ambassador, Delegate for Trade Agreements. From 1984 to 1987, he was Undersecretary of State at the Office of Foreign Economic Affairs, a job he left when he was nominated to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1986. Cornelio Sommaruga served as President of the ICRC from 1987 to 1999, succeeding Alexandre Hay. During his tenure, the budget and the international activities of the Committee increased considerably. He maintained the neutrality of the ICRC while keeping close ties to all governments of States signatories of the Geneva conventions. One of his initiatives was to propose in 1992 the introduction of an additional symbol representing the Red Cross movement, alongside the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which would be \\"devoid of any national, religious or political connotation [and] would be available to States and National Societies unable to adopt either of the existing emblemsCornelio Sommaruga, ‚ÄúUnity and plurality of the emblems‚Äù,IRRC, No. 289, July‚ÄìAugust 1992, pp. 333-338, quoted by Fran√ßois Bugnion in Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal, ICRC, May 2007, p.34 \\". After 15 years of negotiations this emblem was finally made official as the Red Crystal at the 29th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in Geneva on 20 and 21 June 2006.Fran√ßois Bugnion, Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal, ICRC, May 2007, p.56 \\" Sommaruga was the founding President in April, 2002 of Initiatives of Change International , a voluntary association of independent national legal bodies of Initiatives of Change (IofC). As head of this international movement working to build bridges of trust across the world's divides, he was able to support peace and reconciliation initiatives in Africa's Great Lakes region and in Sierra Leone.IofC's actions in the Great Lakes regions have developed under Cornelio Sommaruga's mandate. http://www.iofc.org/great-lakes-project-activities He continues to serve on a number of charitable and corporate boards. =Controversy= Israel refused to cooperate with a team appointed by United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan in 2002 to investigate allegations of a massacre in Jenin, partly because Cornelio Sommaruga was personally unacceptable to the Israeli government, due to allegations that he had made a remark comparing the possibility of ICRC official recognition of the Red Star of David emblem (Magen David Adom, see Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement) to recognition of a \\"Red Swastika\\". =Family life= Cornelio Sommaruga married Ornella Marzorati in 1957 and they have six children.Cornelio Sommaruga's lecture at Centre d'Etudes Catholique in Geneva on 19 November 2012 (in French) http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/other_languages/french/About_GICHD/Staff/Staff_Statements_Articles/SOC-121119-Centre- Catholique-Geneve-fr.pdf Awards * Personalit√© suisse la plus populaire aupr√®s des journalistes √©trangers, Association de la Presse Etrang√®re en Suisse, 2003 * Prix de la Fondation Dr. J.E.

KFFN airs all sports programming syndicated by ESPN Radio. The station originates a local sports program weekdays, The Zach Clark Show. History In January 1956, Tucson's station at 1490, KTKT, applied to move to 990 kHz in order to increase its listening area. In March, under the ownership of William John Hyland III and Dawkins Espy, doing business as the Pima Broadcasting Company, KAIR received its construction permit but could not begin testing until KTKT moved to 990. The station signed on within minutes of KTKT's move to 990 and continued playing the music/news programming which the audience was used to hearing. The station was characterized by a revolving door of owners at the start. James H. Duncan joined the Pima Broadcasting Co. in November 1956. Josh Higgins Radio Enterprises, soon renamed to Joe DuMond Radio Enterprises, bought the station a year later, and in the spring of 1959, the station was sold yet again, to Andrew J. Griffith, Jr., and Jerome K. McCauley, who formed KAIR Broadcasting; the station was operated by Freddie and Josephine Mays and struggled with a contemporary format and many business issues. With the air time sales staff spending the majority of their time in a local bar, it was difficult at best to pay the bills and keep the station on the air. Midway through 1961, the crew and management walked out in what they perceived as a labor dispute. Thomas J. Wallace Jr., whose father Tom Sr. had helped start KTKT, returned to Tucson to manage KAIR, serving as a station manager, salesman, engineer and on-air talent. Wallace's management saved the station, which implemented a Christian format and used the slogan \\"I pledge prayer for KAIR, daily\\"; it broadcast from studios located on the second floor above the business offices at the Ramada Inn. By the end of 1965, with no lasting appreciable growth in listenership or programming development over the four years the new format had been in effect, the station began to struggle. The owners, Freddie and Josephine Mays, were forced to cut their losses and sell the station. By August 1966 KAIR was sold to Frankie Kalil at Kalil & Co., doing business as Number One Radio. Kalil, who had turned KTKT around and made it Tucson's ratings leader, worked his radio magic again and rolled out an easy listening winner, with a new slogan, \\"Drive with KAIR, Everywhere\\". The station remained competitive in the Tucson market until FM listening became more common. It raised its power from 250 to 1,000 watts in 1975. In early 1978, the Surrey Broadcasting Company acquired KAIR, which also owned KJYK at 94.9 FM. In 1985, KAIR also adopted the KJYK calls and became a Top 40/CHR format under the name \\"Joy 1490\\". In 1991, KJYK flipped to a Crossover format‚Äîa first for the Tucson market‚Äîunder the name \\"Power 1490\\". Despite being on AM, the station was highly ranked amongst both kids and teens. But however the station had poor advertising revenue. On June 12, 1995, at 5 PM, after playing \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" by Boyz II Men, the station began stunting with a loop of \\"Push th' Little Daisies\\" by Ween. 24 hours later, the station flipped to an alternative rock format using the calls KNND and the new name \\"1490 The End\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-06-16.pdf One year later, the station flipped to the current format, adopted the KFFN call letters, the \\"Fan\\" moniker, and became an ESPN Radio affiliate. On March 17, 2011, KFFN began simulcasting on FM translator K285DL (104.9 FM). KFFN is also an affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Journal Communications and the E. W. Scripps Company announced on July 30, 2014 that the two companies would merge to create a new broadcast company under the E.W. Scripps Company name that will own the two companies' broadcast properties, including KFFN. The transaction was completed in 2015. In January 2018, Scripps announced that it would sell all of its radio stations. In August 2018, Lotus Communications announced that it would acquire Scripps' Tucson and Boise clusters for $8 million. The deal closed on December 12 of that year.

A photon in this energy range, with a frequency that coincides with that of one of the lines in the Lyman or Werner bands, can be absorbed by H2, placing the molecule in an excited electronic state. Radiative decay (that is, decay into photons) from this excited state occurs rapidly, with roughly 15% of these decays occurring into the vibrational continuum of the molecule, resulting in its dissociation. This two-step photodissociation process, known as the Solomon process, is one of the main mechanisms by which molecular hydrogen is destroyed in the interstellar medium. electronic and vibrational levels of the hydrogen molecule In reference to the figure shown, Lyman-Werner photons are emitted as described below: *A hydrogen molecule can absorb a far-ultraviolet photon (11.2eV Category:Photons ","title":"Lyman‚ÄìWerner photons"},{"id":"9843913","text":"The Manchester, Dorset and Granville Railroad was an intrastate railroad in southwestern Vermont.

The family-owned group operates 18 individual garden centres across England. Notcutts also owns one of the UK's largest rose specialists (Mattocks). Notcutts was founded in Woodbridge, Suffolk, in 1897,http://www.notcutts.co.uk/fcp/content/a-brief- notcutts-history/section and remains a family-owned business. Their first retail garden centre was set up in Woodbridge. Products from Notcutts range from plants to furniture and most Notcutts stores across England include departments such as planteria, indoor and outdoor furniture, indoor plants, pets and a restaurant area. The Notcutts garden centres also have indoor shops which sell household products and other gifts. History The Notcutts Garden Centres head office stands on land which was originally owned by Woodbridge Priory, dissolved by Henry VIII. The grounds were purchased from the Crown by Thomas Seckford, the Woodbridge benefactor and then passed into the hands of the Carthew family. A nurseryman called Thomas Wood purchased the land in 1749 and started Woods Nursery. Thomas Wood passed the nursery to his sons, and eventually it came to John Wood, thus remaining within the Wood family for almost 150 years. Wood died without succession in 1897. The nursery with its fine, old Georgian house, was put up for auction on 11 February 1897. William Notcutt moved from Wrington in Somerset to Ipswich in 1724, as a pastor, bringing the Notcutt name to Suffolk. The first Notcutt family member to enter into the horticultural field was Roger Crompton Notcutt (later known as RCN) who was born in 1869. Unlike his predecessors, he was not burdened by obligations to enter the legal practice. It was recommended that, due to ill health, he should pursue an out-door life. Fortunately, he also had a keen interest in nature, particularly in the growing of plants. This was an interest he was able to pursue when in his teens, he acquired the Broughton Road Nursery in Ipswich. In August 2007, 110 years after purchasing the nursery business from the estate of John Woods, the Notcutt family decided to sell the nursery side of the business to the management team of the nursery and so started a new phase in the history of the nursery. Notcutts exhibited at horticultural shows including RHS Chelsea, Hampton Court, Gardeners' World and the Suffolk County Show, until 2008. At RHS Chelsea the company won fifty gold medals. Now the business focuses solely on its eighteen garden centres across the UK as well as its online presence.

Formerly a streetcar line operated by the Third Avenue Railway, it is now the M104 bus route operated by the New York City Transit Authority, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This bus route no longer runs along the entire route of the former streetcar. Route description The M104 route begins at 41st Street and 8th Avenue, by Times Square. Buses use Eighth Avenue (northbound) and Seventh Avenue (southbound) to Central Park South. The route continues north on Broadway through the Upper West Side, finally turning off at 125th Street, where it turns around at a clockwise loop on Amsterdam Avenue, 129th Street, Convent Avenue, and 125th Street. History The Forty- second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway opened the Boulevard Line in 1884 or 1885, following the 42nd Street Crosstown Line from the East 34th Street Ferry along First Avenue (trackage rights over the Central Park, North and East River Railroad's East Belt Line) and 42nd Street to Times Square, using new trackage on Broadway (then Boulevard) to 125th Street, and turning west on 125th Street over the tracks of the One-Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Street Railroad's 125th Street Crosstown Line to the Fort Lee Ferry.\\"The Street Surface Railway Franchises of New York City\\" by Harry James Carman The Third Avenue Railroad acquired control of the line in November 1895,New York Times,The Third Avenue Gets It, November 22, 1895, page 3 and the Metropolitan Street Railway leased the Third Avenue in May 1900.New York Times, The Metropolitan's Control Ratified, May 18, 1900, page 1 After cable cars stopped running on the Metropolitan's Broadway Line in 1902, the Third Avenue's line was rerouted to continue south on Broadway from Times Square on the Metropolitan's trackage, ending at Houston Street. Effective February 17, 1908, as part of the splitting of the Third Avenue Railroad from the bankrupt Metropolitan Street Railway, the Third Avenue's Broadway cars were sent along their old route, heading east on 42nd Street at Times Square and ending at the East 34th Street Ferry via First Avenue. Simultaneously, the Metropolitan introduced a new line,New York Times, New Broadway Lines Puzzle Passengers, February 18, 1908, page 3New York Times, Getting Used to New Cars, February 19, 1908, page 3 the Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue Line, running from Broadway and Houston Street along Broadway, Seventh Avenue, 53rd Street, Ninth Avenue, Columbus Avenue, Broadway, and Amsterdam Avenue to 125th Street.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac, 1916 This was done because the Third Avenue's Broadway trackage ended at Times Square; south of Times Square was Metropolitan trackage. Broadway buses stopped serving the East 34th Street Ferry on September 29, 1917. Buses were substituted for streetcars on December 15, 1946. In June 2010, due to budget cuts, the M104 bus route was truncated to Times Square from the Headquarters of the United Nations, eliminating service along 42nd Street.

Before 1866, Eye & Dunsden was part of the trans-county parish of Sonning. Up to 2003, the parish also included the western half of the village of Binfield Heath which was then joined with the rest of that village, previously in Shiplake, to create a new parish. To the west, it abuts Berkshire's county town Reading. To the east is also the parish of Shiplake, the near part of which on the road to Henley-on-Thames is known as Shiplake Row. Sonning Common and the relatively early 2000s-created civil parish of Binfield Heath around that village rise to the north. In 2011 its population was 366, bar farmhouses, riverboats and caravans all grouped in the above three settlements. Caversham Lakes, including the Thames and Kennet Marina, Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake, Reading Sailing Club, Isis Water Ski Club, and Sonning Works, are all on the Thames flood plain within the parish.

South Yorkshire website 360 degree panorama from Church of St. Nicholas, Bradfield.  History  =Anglo-Saxon= Christian worship in the Bradfield area dates from at least the 9th century, as a Saxon cross discovered in 1870 in the nearby village of Low Bradfield was dated by specialists to that time. Local historian John Wilson (1719-83) believed that the original Norman church was founded in 1109 when deciphering ancient writing in the church's original east window.\\"The Parish Church of St. Nicholas, Bradfield\\", John & Julia Hatfield, No ISBN, Gives founding date and general history. The Normans regarded the area around Bradfield as strategically important and had built a motte-and-bailey fortified keep in the area after the conquest. William de Lovetot, Lord of Hallamshire, had built the Church of St. Mary, Ecclesfield, nine kilometres to the east, at the end of the 11th century, to which St. Nicholas, Bradfield became a chapel of ease until 1868 when it became a parish of its own. The Saxon cross stands against the north wall of the nave and is believed to date from the tenth century. The original Norman church was an uncomplicated two cell building. A square bell tower was added in the 14th century before it was largely rebuilt in the Gothic Perpendicular style during the 1480s, using some of the original masonry which consisted of local gritstone. The interior of the church changed drastically under the influence of the Puritans during the English Civil War, when statues, wall paintings and stained glass were destroyed and the walls whitewashed. =19th century= These changes were reversed in the latter part of the 19th century when the interior was restored to its 15th-century appearance. Parts of the original Norman church survive in the north arcade, the font and the chancel arch. The previously mentioned 9th century Saxon cross was integrated into the north wall of the church in 1886. The cross is roughly fashioned in local gritstone and is simply decorated with five bosses on the head, which was the Saxon way of depicting the crucifixtion. Records of births, marriages and burials date from 1559. Music in the church was originally provided by a local band of musicians featuring a bassoon and violoncello accompanying the choir. The musicians were replaced in 1843 by an organ. The present organ was installed in 1973. It was built by Laycock and Bannister and was bought second hand from a church in Middlesbrough that was closing. Today John Hardman studio in Birmingham 250px =Windows= The interior contains 17 stained glass windows of varying sizes. Much of the glass is from the late 19th century although the Medieval Window includes fragments of glass from the 15th century. During the Second World War it was stored in a local clay mine to protect it from bomb damage. The windows include designs by Sir John Ninian Comper, Clayton and Bell and Hardman & Co.. The east window, which is the largest, was donated by the Wilson family in 1870, and depicts the nativity, baptism, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension of Christ. A window on the west wall was donated by the Dixon family in 1930. The family had been the owners of the Spring Grove paper mill in Oughtibridge since 1871. The main west window is situated in the ringing chamber of the tower. It was a gift of James Wilson Rimington-Wilson (1822-77) of Broomhead Hall and depicts Saint Nicholas and Saint Cuthbert.thepeerage.com. Gives details of Rimington- Wilson. It is one of ten windows in the church attributed to William Francis Dixon (1848-1928) of the Clayton & Bell company. =Interior= The pulpit features carved panels portraying Christ with the four Gospel writers. Oak panels brought from Normandy in 1886 decorate the sanctuary and the altar. The interior has a Camber beam roof with the wall posts having carved feet and various embossing. The original Norman baptismal font is still in place; it is made of magnesian limestone with no decoration at all and is believed to have been built and presented by the Cistercian monks of Roche Abbey in the 12th century. A sunken vestry was discovered and refurbished during the 19th century, which is thought to have been used by visiting clergy as sleeping quarters. =Memorial= The church features memorials to the Bradfield men who perished in both World wars. A slate plaque presented by the local water authority in 1989 stands in the south aisle and commemorates the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, when the nearby Dale Dike Reservoir broke and 270 people drowned. A number of flood victims are buried in the churchyard. The grave of William Horsfield, who discovered the crack in the embankment of the dam, is located in the churchyard. He died in 1881.Mick Armitages's Sheffield Flood website. Details of William Horsfield. =Bell Tower= The bell tower contains a peal of eight bells made by John Taylor Bellfounders of Loughborough. Six were cast in 1847, while two more were added recently in 1997. Records show Bradfield's bells were not only rung on Sundays but also to commemorate events of national importance, such as on 5 November \\"for the Gunpowder Treason\\" and from 1660 onwards on 29 May (Oak Apple Day) to celebrate The Restoration. The irregularly-shaped watch house which stands by the main gates was built in 1745 to guard against grave robbers looking for fresh corpses for medical study, with friends and relatives of the deceased often guarding the recently buried loved ones with guns. It is the only surviving watch house in Yorkshire,www.coffeebeer.co.uk. gives info on Watch house but gives date of origin as 1745. Church leaflet say 1831. and today it is a private dwelling.

This decision, along with R v Khan (1990), began what is called the \\"hearsay revolution\\", supplementing the traditional categorical approach to hearsay exceptions with a new \\"principled approach\\" based on reliability and necessity of testimony. Background Arthur Larry Smith was accused of killing Aritha Monalisa King. It was believed they had both traveled from Detroit to London, Ontario. While in Canada, Smith had asked King to smuggle drugs back for him. She refused and was killed by Smith. At trial, King's mother testified she received four phone calls from her daughter the night of her death. The last call came from near where her body was found. King had told her mother she would be home very soon. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the statements could be admissible as evidence. The trial judge admitted the evidence and Smith was convicted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new trial. Judgment Lamer CJ, writing for the Court, dismissed the appeal. His reasons focused on the \\"principled approach\\" first developed in Khan. He found that the new approach was not just limited to child testimony but rather was a new method that applied to all hearsay statements, calling it a \\"triumph of a principled analysis over a set of ossified judicially created categories\\".

The same thing happened to the second, but when it was the turn of the youngest, the man could not afford a golden ball. He hung up a silver one instead; and another prince passed but as it was too poor for him, another man came instead to marry her. As a result, the youngest daughter's sisters refused to associate with her. One day, as she was giving birth, fairies asked for shelter; she tried to plead that she was not well, but the fairies continued pleading, and she let them stay. When she gave birth to a daughter, the fairies blessed the baby with beauty, riches, and having flowers fall from her mouth when she spoke. This reconciled the sisters who married princes with their youngest sister. When the enchanted maiden had grown up, a prince who was betrothed to a daughter of her aunt fell in love with her and wanted nothing to do with his betrothed. He fell ill, and his physicians ordered him to travel. The enchanted maiden climbed up a tower to watch him go, and the betrothed maiden put out her eyes with a stick. A man gave her shelter, but when the prince returned, his betrothed claimed to be the enchanted maiden, who could not go to him because she was blind. The enchanted maiden told the betrothed that she would give her flowers for her wedding in return for her eyes, so the betrothed girl sent her her eyes. She put them back and went to the wedding to ask the prince not to marry the betrothed girl. The prince asked his guests that after having lost something, bought another, and found the original, whether he should use the new or the old. They recommended the old, and so he married the enchanted maiden.

After Hyuna's departure in July, Yubin was added into the group prior to the release of their debut studio album, The Wonder Years (2007). The album spawned the hit single \\"Tell Me\\", which topped various South Korea's on and offline music charts. Wonder Girls further established themselves as one of the top girl groups in the country with the hit singles \\"So Hot\\" and \\"Nobody\\", which were released in 2008. After being released as a single in the United States in 2009, \\"Nobody\\" charted at number seventy-six on the Billboard Hot 100, making Wonder Girls the first South Korean group to enter the chart. The group began their entry into the American market the same year as an opening act for the Jonas Brothers' World Tour, performing English versions of their songs. In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career and was replaced by Hyerim prior to the Korean & US releases of the single \\"2 Different Tears\\". Their second studio album, Wonder World (2011), yielded the successful single \\"Be My Baby\\". In 2012, Wonder Girls starred in the TeenNick movie The Wonder Girls, and released their last three singles as a quintet, notably \\"Like This\\" and \\"Like Money\\", before going on a three-year long hiatus. In 2015, it was announced that Sunye and Sohee decided to leave the group while Sunmi would resume promotion with the remaining members.

The group released their final single \\"Draw Me\\" on February 10; it also serves as a celebration for their 10th anniversary since debut. Artistry and influences =Musical styles= The Wonder Girls are known for their signature retro sound and concept. Their music has been noted to contain elements from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The Wonder Girls are known as \\"South Korea's Retro Queens\\", as their music has been noted to contain elements from the 1960s, such as in their hit \\"Nobody\\", 1970s, such as in the reggae track \\"Why So Lonely\\", and 1980s, heard on the songs \\"Tell Me\\", \\"So Hot\\", \\"2 Different Tears\\", \\"Be My Baby\\" and \\"I Feel You\\". Their music videos also allude to vintage fashion and performance, with \\"Nobody\\" being mostly inspired by African-American 1960s culture and famous R&B; group The Supremes, while \\"I Feel You\\" takes place in 1987 and shows the members playing their own instruments and various other scenes with heavy 1980s inspiration. Members The group consisted of five members at the time of its debut in 2007: Sunye, Sohee, Hyuna, Sunmi and Yeeun. Shortly after, in the same year, Hyuna left the group due to concerns over her health, which led to the addition of Yubin as replacement. In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career, and trainee Hyerim was selected as her replacement. Sohee departed from the group in late 2013 following the expiration of her contract with JYP Entertainment, while Sunye left the group in late 2014; their departures were officially announced in July 2015. For the group's 2015 comeback, Sunmi returned to the group, and served as a member alongside Yeeun, Yubin, and Hyerim; the Wonder Girls remained as four-piece band until their disbandment in 2017. =Line- up= *Park Ye-eun ‚Äì lead vocals (2007‚Äì2015); main vocals, keyboard, rhythm guitar, leader (2015‚Äì2017) *Kim Yu-bin ‚Äì main rapper, vocals (2007‚Äì2017); drums (2015‚Äì2017) *Lee Sun-mi ‚Äì vocals (2007‚Äì2010); lead vocals, bass guitar (2015‚Äì2017) *Woo Hye-rim ‚Äì vocals, rapper (2010‚Äì2017); lead guitar (2015‚Äì2017) *Kim Hyun-ah ‚Äì main rapper, vocals (2007) *Ahn So-hee ‚Äì main dancer, vocals (2007‚Äì2013) *Min Sun-ye ‚Äì main vocals, leader (2007‚Äì2014) =Timeline= ImageSize = width:600 height:200 PlotArea = width:405 height:175 left:75 bottom:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:02/10/2007 till:05/31/2017 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:a value:rgb(1,0,0) legend:FirstGeneration id:b value:rgb(1,0.5,0) legend:SecondGeneration id:c value:rgb(0,0,0.5) legend:ThirdGeneration id:d value:rgb(0,1,0.5) legend:FourthGeneration id:e value:rgb(1,1,0) legend:FifthGeneration Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2008 gridcolor:black PlotData = color:blue width:7 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from bar:Hyuna from:start till:07/28/2007 bar:Sohee from:start till:12/21/2013 bar:Sunye from:start till:12/10/2014 bar:Sunmi from:start till:01/22/2010 bar:Sunmi from:06/24/2015 till:01/26/2017 bar:Yeeun from:start till:01/26/2017 color:magenta width:7 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from bar:Yubin from:10/08/2007 till:01/26/2017 color:green width:7 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from bar:Hyerim from:01/22/2010 till:01/26/2017 Discography * The Wonder Years (2007) * Wonder World (2011) * Reboot (2015) Filmography =Film= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !Title !Year !Role !class=unsortableNotes - !scope=rowThe Last Godfather 2010 Cameo Performed \\"Nobody\\" - !scope=rowThe Wonder Girls 2012 Themselves Television film } =Television= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !Title !Year !class=unsortableNotes - !scope=rowMTV Wonder Girls 2006‚Äì2010 First reality show - !scope=rowWonder Bakery 2008 Second reality show - !scope=rowWelcome to Wonderland 2009 Wonder Girls documentary - !scope=rowMade in Wonder Girls 2010 Third reality show - !scope=rowStar Life Theater 2011 Reality show documenting their Wonder World comeback } Tours ;Headlining * 1st Wonder Tour (2009) * Wonder Girls World Tour (2010) *Wonder Girls 1st Asia Tour (2010) * Wonder World Tour (2012) * The Like Money US Tour (2012) ;Opening acts * Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009 (2009) =JYP Nation= *JYP Nation (2009) *JYP Nation \\"Team Play\\" (2010) *JYP Nation (2011) *JYP Nation \\"One Mic\\" (2014) *JYP Nation \\"Hologram Concert\\" (2016) *JYP Nation \\"Mix & Match\\" (2016) Awards and nominations References External links  Wonder Girls discography at MusicTea * Category:2007 establishments in South Korea Category:2017 disestablishments in South Korea Category:English-language singers from South Korea Category:Japanese-language singers of South Korea Category:Mandarin-language singers of South Korea Category:JYP Entertainment artists Category:K-pop music groups Category:Korean Mandopop singers Category:Korean Music Award winners Category:Mnet Asian Music Award winners Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2017 Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups from Seoul Category:South Korean dance music groups Category:South Korean expatriates in the United States Category:South Korean girl groups Category:South Korean synthpop groups ","title":"Wonder Girls"},{"id":"9844494","text":"is a Japanese actress and pop star.

Its main subsidiary is the Otter Tail Power Company. As of 2007, Otter Tail Power Company serves at least 423 towns at retail and delivers power to about 14 municipal utilities. The company currently has a workforce of over 750 employees, a generating capacity of 660 megawatts, and owns over of electrical power transmission lines (the majority of which are operated at 41.6 kV). The company serves 128,500 customers in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota. History The company was incorporated in 1907 when funds were secured to begin construction of the Dayton Hollow Dam southwest of Fergus Falls. Once the dam came online in April 1909, the company transmitted power at 22 kV over a line to serve the customers of the Northern Light Electric Company at Wahpeton, North Dakota. Shortly thereafter, contracts were secured to provide power at wholesale to the cities of Breckenridge and Fergus Falls, MN (the latter after their own municipal utility's dam failed). After connecting Foxhome, MN, to the system in 1912, the company connected or purchased electric distribution systems in 10 Minnesota towns (the most prominent being Elbow Lake and Morris, MN) and a second town in North Dakota (Fairmount) the following year. Northern Light Electric also merged with Otter Tail at this time and its owner came on board as the company's first general manager. The first South Dakota community served by the company was White Rock in 1915. By 1920, the company was serving approximately 44 towns, all but a handful of which were in or near Otter Tail County. However, the company quickly found its Minnesota service area hemmed in by neighboring utility companies that were also rushing to add territory. This led to the company expanding westward into and across much of eastern North Dakota, reaching Jamestown, ND by 1924 (the company was serving over 100 towns by this time). The company grew at an incredible rate over the next 5 years‚Äîreaching the Missouri River at Washburn in 1926 and approaching the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 1928. By the end of the 1920s, the company's service area had tripled to serve more than 310 towns. During the Great Depression, the company was apparently not as badly affected as some of its neighbors but was still forced to focus more on survival than growth. By 1939, the worst was past, and they were ready to move forward once more. Between 1940 and 1944, Otter Tail added territory by merger or acquisition of 6 smaller power companies within or adjacent to its territory (almost all of who had corporate parents that were required to divest these properties due to passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935). These purchases increased its territory to its present size of , about the same size as the state of Wisconsin. The one exception in this territory is the Red River Valley between Grand Forks and Fargo, ND, which was then and still is served by Northern States Power Company (now Xcel Energy). After the final major acquisition in 1944, the company had reached its 'maximum system' of 496 towns served at both retail and wholesale. As the company matured over the next several decades, the number of towns served within the region would shrink (mainly due to towns served at wholesale changing suppliers and some smaller retail towns dying out). A few towns were added between 1944 and 1968‚Äîthe largest being the purchase of Fergus Falls' municipal utility in 1953 and the last addition being the transfer of several towns in Polk County, Minnesota, from Northern States Power Company when the 34.5 kV transmission line serving these towns approached its load limit. A merger with Montana-Dakota Utilities was briefly explored in the late 1960s but was soon dropped due to all the regulatory hurdles involved. By the 1990s, flat revenues from the utility operations led the company to establish a subsidiary (Varistar) to acquire and oversee non-utility businesses. In 2001, the company changed its name to Otter Tail Corporation with the utility becoming a division within the company. In late 2008, the company completed a reorganization to realign the utility operations into a subsidiary within Otter Tail Corporation. Hydropower In the beginning, Otter Tail Power built a series of hydroelectric plants to provide power for its system and these served the company well until its expansion in the 1920s outstripped the dams' capacity (steam provided the bulk of the company's power needs from then on). The company has grown to such a point that today only about 1% of the company's needs still comes from hydropower. The dams are: Dayton Hollow (1909 - southwest of Fergus Falls), Hoot Lake (1914 / 1918 - east Fergus Falls), Pisgah (1918 - west Fergus Falls), Wright (rebuilt 1922 - downtown Fergus Falls), Taplin Gorge (1925 - northeast of Fergus Falls), and Bemidji (built early 1900s / purchased in 1944). Hoot Lake is unique in that the dam also forms the water intake for the coal-fired power plant nearby.http://www.otpco.com/AboutCompany/HydroPower.asp Coal-fired plants After the company's load exceeded the capacity of its dams, the company then switched to coal to meet its energy requirements. A number of plants were added to its system in the 1920s, starting with Hoot Lake in 1921. The most important one was built near Washburn, ND in 1926, as it was one of the earliest large-scale plants to burn lignite exclusively. The company then added several more plants across the system in the late 1940s to meet the huge surge in demand after WWII, but when the company's Big Stone plant was completed in 1974, all of these smaller plants were retired and removed. The company completed its Coyote plant in 1981, after which another of the company's earlier plants (at Ortonville, MN) was removed. The Hoot Lake plant is the last of the company's early plants still in operation, with the two current operating units having been completed in 1959 and 1964 (the earlier units from 1921, 1923, 1937, and 1948 have all long since been retired and dismantled). The company recently submitted a plan to replace the old Hoot Lake plant with a new gas-fired plant by 2021. Wind power Otter Tail Power Company currently owns 138 MW of wind generation, and purchases an additional 45 MW for a total of 183 MW of wind power. By 2010 wind generation on the system is expected to be equivalent to 18 percent of retail sales.http://www.otpco.com/AboutCompany/WindPower.asp Owned wind resources and power purchase agreements for Otter Tail Power Company include: Luverne Wind Farm, Ashtabula Wind Energy Center, Langdon Wind Energy Center, and North Dakota Wind II.

The creature was first seen in July by Clarence \\"Toughy\\" Cable, co-manager of the Blue Grass Body Shop, a junk and wrecking yard located north of Milton. As Cable was walking through the junkyard, he saw the lizard emerge from behind the wrecked vehicles and it hissed at him several times. He said it had \\"big eyes similar to a frog's... Beneath its mouth was an off-white color and there were black and white stripes cross ways of its body with quarter-sized speckles over it.\\" Cable's brother Garrett was the next to see the creature on July 27. While working in the junkyard, he saw a pile of old car hoods begin to vibrate and move as the lizard's head and shoulders emerged from underneath the debris. Frightened, he left to get his brother, but when they returned to the area, guns in hand, the creature was gone. The next day, Cable saw the lizard (or one similar to it) again, except this time it appeared to be larger‚Äînearly 15 feet in length. After throwing a rock at it, the lizard hissed at him and fled into some brush. Cable retrieved a rifle from his house and fired into the brush, but couldn't be certain he killed the creature. In early August, a search party scoured the area surrounding the Blue Grass Body Shop for any sign of the lizard, but no evidence was found. During the Trimble Banner's investigation into the sightings, Clarence Cable said the creature looked similar to, but not exactly like, a monitor lizard. He theorized that one of the wrecked vehicles they had acquired in the past from one of the western states contained eggs that hatched in the heat of the junkyard. When wreckage began to be removed in the spring, fewer places existed where the lizard (or lizards) could hide, resulting in the sightings.

Decision No. 1 The case recognized the traditional role of fishing in Mi'kmaq culture. Shown is a seagoing canoe used for fishing and transport. Atlantic Neptune, ca 1770 The Court held in the first decision that the famous Donald Marshall's catching and selling of eels was valid under 1760 and 1761 treaties between the Mi'kmaq and Britain, and that federal fishery regulations governing a closed fishing season and the regulating and the requirement of licenses to fish and sell the catch would infringe the treaty right. In 1999, the court of appeal heard the Marshall case. The court of appeal indicated that the trial judge had made an error in law and, therefore, overturned the decision. (p. 89) The appeal Judge Justice Binnie stated that the trial judge‚Äôs error was in not focusing attention on the Maliseet‚ÄìBritish treaty of 1 February 1760. = Commentary = A 2009 book by a former Nova Scotia crown attorney, Alex M Cameron, who had argued similar cases for the Province against Indigenous logging, was sharply critical of the Supreme Court's decision in R v Marshall.Dianne Pothier, 2010, p 189. Other commentators, including Greg Flynn (2010), and Dianne Pothier (2010), have seen Alex Cameron's analysis as lacking \\"nuance and balance,\\" and as being \\"fundamentally flawed\\"Dianne Pothier, 2010, pp 190, 191. Cameron argues, among other things, that the Supreme Court was wrong in asserting that it was being asked to decide on the rights of all Mi'Kmaq. He holds that the courts were only being asked to decide on the right of an individual Mi'Kmaq from Cape Breton, Donald Marshall.Cameron, 2009. Pp 61, 62.  Decision No. 2  In the second decision the Court elaborated the extension of Indigenous treaty rights stating that they are still subject to Canadian law. Both decisions proved highly controversial. The first elicited anger from the non-Indigenous fishing community for giving seemingly complete immunity to Indigenous peoples to fish. The second decision, which was claimed to be an \\"elaboration\\", was seen as a retreat from the first decision and angered Indigenous communities. The second decision was issued on a motion for re-hearing the case brought by fishermen's associations in which the court elaborated in particular about such things as the relationship between treaty rights and conservation that had been more implicit in the first decision.

The specific emphasis in gender HCI is on variations in how people of different genders interact with computers. Examples Gender HCI research has been conducted in the following areas (among others): *Biases in perceptions of gendered computerized partners *The effects of confidence and self-efficacy on genders' interactions with software. *The design of gender-specific software, such as video games created for women. *The design of display screen sizes and how they affect different genders. *The design of gender-neutral problem-solving software. Overview Gender HCI investigates ways in which attributes of software (or even hardware) can interact with gender differences. As with all of HCI, Gender HCI is a highly interdisciplinary area. Findings from fields such as psychology, computer science, marketing, neuroscience, education, and economics strongly suggest that men and women problem solve, communicate, and process information differently. Gender HCI investigates whether these differences need to be taken into account in the design of software and hardware. History The term Gender HCI was coined in 2004 by Laura Beckwith, a PhD candidate at Oregon State University, and her advisor Margaret Burnett.Beckwith, L. and Burnett, M. Gender: An important factor in end-user programming environments?, In Proc. Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing Languages, IEEE (2004), 107-114. They discovered that, although there had been some activity that could be characterized as Gender HCI work, people did not know about each other's work. The relevant research reports were isolated and scattered about various fields. Since that time, they and others have worked to help researchers know about each other's work and practitioners to be aware of the findings, so as to allow this area to mature as a subarea of HCI. The following are a brief set of milestones in the history of this emerging subarea. *1987: Games designed as \\"gender neutral\\" look like games designed for boys. (Chuck Huff). *1989: Ethnographic research exploring women, programming, and computers (Sherry Turkle). *1995: Gender differences in self-efficacy and attitudes toward computers (Tor Busch). *1998: Gender factors in the design of video games (Justine Cassell). *2002: Wider displays more beneficial to all users, especially females (Mary Czerwinski, Desney S. Tan, George G. Robertson). *2004: The concept Gender HCI made explicit (Laura Beckwith, Margaret Burnett). *2006: A research workshop on Gender HCI.De Angeli, A. and Bianchi-Berthouze, N. Proceedings of Gender and Interaction, Real and Virtual Women in a Male World Workshop, Venice, May 23, (2006). Selected findings Here are some results from the Gender HCI research conducted to date ‚Äì ordered from most to least recent, within categories: #\\"Reward Expectations of Gendered Computers.\\" #*In one experiment, subjects worked on a task with a computerized partner that was named James or Julie. The task was gender-neutral, meaning that it was not directly relevant to being a man or woman. The results showed that subjects behaved the same way toward a computer named James or Julie. Despite these similarities in behavior, subjects estimated that a computer named James would cost them significantly more than one named Julie. The findings show gender shape user perceptions of their computers, which lack the human features that define the characteristic of gender. #Confidence-related findings. #*For spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, (1) female end users had significantly lower self- efficacy than males and (2) women with low self-efficacy were significantly less likely to work effectively with problem-solving features available in the software. In contrast, males' self-efficacy did not impact their effectiveness with these features.Beckwith, L. Burnett, M., Wiedenbeck, S., Cook, C., Sorte, S., and Hastings, M. Effectiveness of end-user debugging software features: Are there gender issues? ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2005), 869-878. #*In a study of the computer attitudes and self-efficacy of 147 college students, gender differences existed in self-efficacy for complex tasks (such as word processing and spreadsheet software), but not simpler tasks. Also, male students had more experience working with computers and reported more encouragement from parents and friends.Busch, T. Gender differences in self efficacy and attitudes towards computer, Journal of Educational Computing Research 12,(1995)147-158. #Software feature related findings. #*In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, female end users were significantly slower to try out unfamiliar features. Females significantly more often agreed with the statement, \\"I was afraid I would take too long to learn the [untaught feature].\\" Even if they tried it once, females were significantly less likely to adopt new features for repeated use. For females, unlike for males, self-efficacy predicted the amount of effective feature usage. There was no significant difference in the success of the two genders or in learning how the features worked, implying that females' low self- efficacy about their usage of new features was not an accurate assessment of their problem-solving potential, but rather became a self-fulfilling prophecy. #Behavior related findings. #*In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, tinkering (playfully experimenting) with features was adopted by males more often than females. While males were comfortable with this behavior, some did it to excess. For females, the amount of tinkering predicted success. Pauses after any action were predictive of better understanding for both genders.Beckwith, L. Kissinger, C., Burnett, M., Wiedenbeck, S., Lawrance, J., Blackwell, A., and Cook, C. Tinkering and gender in end-user programmers' debugging, ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2006), 231-240. #*Males viewed machines as a challenge, something to be mastered, overcome, and be measured against. They were risk-takers, and they demonstrated this by eagerly trying new techniques and approaches. Females rejected the image of the male hacker as alienating and depersonalizing. Their approach to computers was \\"soft;\\" tactile, artistic, and communicative.Turkle, S. Computational reticence: Why women fear the intimate machine. In Technology and Women's Voices, Cheris Kramerae (ed.), (1988), 41-61. #Hardware interface findings. #*Larger displays helped reduce the gender gap in navigating virtual environments. With smaller displays, males' performance was better than females'. With larger displays, females' performance improved and males' performance was not negatively affected.Czerwinski, M., Tan, D., and Robertson, G., Women take a wider view, In Proc. CHI 2002, ACM Press (2002), 195-202.Tan, S., Czerwinski, M., and Robertson, G., Women go with the (optical) flow, In Proc. of CHI 2003, Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2003), 209-215. #Video games findings. #*Several findings were reported about girls' interests that relate to video games, with interpretations for the video game software industry.Gorriz, C. and Medina, C. Engaging girls with computers through software games. Communications of the ACM, (2000), 42-49. #*Several researchers explored what girls seek in video games, and implications for video game designers. Among the implications were collaboration vs. competition preferences, and use of non-violent rewards versus death and destruction as rewards. These works argue both sides of the question as to whether or not to design games specifically for girls.Cassell, J. Genderizing HCI , MIT Media Lab, (1998).Cassell, J. and Jenkins, H. (Eds.), From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, (1998). #Other related findings about gender and computers. #*In a study of the way people interacted with conversational software agents in relation to the sex of the agent, the female virtual agent received many more violent and sexual overtures than either the male one or the gender-free one (a robot).De Angeli, A. and Brahnam, S. Sex stereotypes and conversational agents.

Background She was a daughter of Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, and his mistress, Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland, an actress at the Palais Royal. Her paternal grandparents were Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, and Anne Hill, daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon. Her paternal uncles included Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, and Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley. Her parents were married six years after her birth, on 29 March 1794, at which point she was legitimised. Marriages and children On 3 July 1806, she married her first husband, Sir William Abdy, 7th Baronet. Their marriage lasted nine years, but remained childless. Abdy had introduced her to his friend Lord Charles Cavendish-Bentinck, a younger son of former British Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. At some point during her first marriage, Anne and Lord Charles became lovers. They eloped on 5 September 1815, following which Abdy brought a suit for criminal conversation (\\"crim. con.\\", in Regency parlance) for 30,000 pounds, but won only 7,000 pounds in damages. During the discussion of the divorce bill, the customary provision against remarriage was struck out in the House of Lords. Sir William Abdy was granted a divorce by royal consent to a special Act of Parliament on 25 June 1816. Anne and Lord Charles were married on 23 July 1816, enabling their first child (which she was expecting) to be born legitimate three weeks later.Thorne, R.G. \\"CAVENDISH BENTINCK, Lord William Charles Augustus (1780-1826)\\" reference to the Abdy divorce in his biographical entry, in his book , p. 422.

Shah Mir is believed to have come to Kashmir during the rule of Suhadeva (), where he rose to prominence. After the death of Suhadeva and his brother Udayanadeva, Shah Mir established his own kingship, founding the Shah Mir dynasty in 1339, which lasted till 1561. Origins There are two theories regarding Shah Mir's origin. Some Persian chronicles of Kashmir describe Shah Mir as a descendant of the rulers of Swat. Historian A. Q. Rafiqi thinks it more likely that he was a descendant of Pesrian or Turkic immigrants to Swat. It has also been suggested that he belonged to a Sufi or Qadiri family. Some scholars state that the Panjgabbar valley, the location described by Jonaraja, was actually peopled by Khasas and so ascribe a Khasa ethnicity to Shah Mir. Most modern historians accept the Swati origins of Shah Mir. Kashmiri scholar N. K. Zutshi, having critically examined the sources, reconciles the two versions by noting that the Persian chronicles mentions Swadgir rather than Swat, which he interprets as Swadgabar, meaning \\"suburbs of Gabar\\", which coincides with Jonaraja's description of Panchagahvara-Simani (on the borders of Panchagagvara). A. Q. Rafiqi states: Career = Early Service = During the reign of Suhadeva, a Tatar chief by the name of Zulju invaded Kashmir and ravaged it. Suhadeva fled the country and his general Ramachandra occupied the throne. In the confusion Rinchan (),Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.372‚Äì80Kashmƒ´r Under the SultƒÅnsby Mohibbul Hasan, Aakar Books, 2005 sought the aid of various generals, including Shah Mir, and caused an internal uprising, seizing the throne. He married Kota Rani, the daughter of Ramachandra. Rinchan embraced Islam at the hands of the ascetic, Bulbul Shah, and took the Muslim name of Sultan Sadruddin. He was later attacked by rebels, and was badly wounded, dying in 1323 A.D. Just before his death Sultan Sadruddin summoned his trusted minister, Shah Mir, who had since then risen to some prominence, and put his son, Haider, and wife, Kota Rani, in his care. After the death of Sadruddin, Kota Rani married Udayanadeva, the brother of Suhadeva. However he was a weak ruler, so nearly all duties associated with governance fell on Kota Rani. = During and After the Later Turco-Mongol Invasion = During the reign of Udayanadeva, the Kashmir Valley was again invaded by Mongol-Turk forces, and Udayanadeva fled to Ladakh. Kota Rani, along with Shah Mir, called upon the many disorganized Chieftains, rallying them together. This now unified resistance defeated the invading armies, prompting their retreat from the valley.  Revolt Against Kota Rani  In the aftermath of the conflict, Shah Mir won prestige for his role in unifying the people. Kota Rani took notice of his increasing popularity, and in an effort to check him, appointed Bhatta Bhiksana, a powerful man within the kingdom, as her Prime Minister. She also decided to move her capital to Andarkot, away from Srinagar, where Shah Mir had a major seat of power. This enraged Shah Mir, as he felt ignored in spite of his great labors for the kingdom. He succeeded in assassinating Bhiksana by means of a plot, and asked Kota Rani to marry him and share power, threatening to wage war on her if she was to refuse. She declined, and the two of them began organizing their armies. Shah Mir set out with his army from Srinagar towards Andarkot. Kota Rani sent out a force to check his advance, but it was promptly defeated. The fort at Andarkot was then laid siege to. While this was going on, many of Kota Rani's troops, seeing the futility of the situation deserted, and joined Shah Mir, to whom most important chiefs in the kingdom had already pledged allegiance. Kota Rani soon surrendered, and accepted Shah Mir's earlier proposal. However given the awkward situation in which Kota Rani accepted, and the possibility for a counter-uprising, made more probable when accounting for the small slivers of support Kota Ranis till had, Shah Mir could not take any risks. Kota Rani and her two sons were imprisoned, where they later died. = Aftermath and Establishment of the Sultanate = With Kota Rani defeated, Shar Mir declared himself ruler, taking on the title Sultan Shams-ud-Din. Shams-ud-Din worked to establish Islam in Kashmir and was aided by his descendants. In an effort to keep the local feudal chiefs in check, he raised to power two indigenous families, the Magres and the Chaks. He also introduced a new era to the people of Kashmir, called the Kashmiri Era. This replaced the Laukika Era that had existed prior to this. The Kashmiri Era began with Rinchan's accession and conversion to Islam in 720 A.H. (~1320 CE) This Era remained in use until the Mughal Conquest of Kashmir in 1586. Shams-ud-Din had two sons, Jamshed and Ali Sher. The Tomb of Sultan Shams-ud-Din Shah Mir. He reigned for three years and five months from 1339‚Äì42. He is currently buried in Andarkot, near Sambal.

R. fascians is the only phytopathogenic member of the genus Rhodococcus; its host range includes both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous hosts. Because it commonly afflicts tobacco (Nicotiana) plants, it is an agriculturally significant pathogen.  Physiology and morphology  R. fascians is an aerobic, pleiomorphic, actinomycete that is nonmotile and does not form spores. When grown on the surface of an agar plate, colonies are orange in color and appear both smooth or rough. Virulence R. fascians can be a pathogen of plants, both angiosperm or gymnosperm. Infected plants show typical symptoms, such as leaf deformation, witches broom and leaf gall, which development depends on the plant's cultivar, plant's age, and the bacterial strain. Leaf deformation consists of widening of parenchyma and growth of vascular system, resulting in wrinkling of laminae and widening of veins. Leafy gall is a gall originated from a bud which would not develop under normal conditions. All effects coming from the infection of R. fascians do not depend on plant cells transformation (as for Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Agrobacterium rhizogenes), but on expression of virulence-related genes of bacterium and on the production of compounds that can interfere with normal plant growth and development. During the infection, R. fascians usually stays outside vegetal tissues, near a junction or cavity of a plant's cell walls, maybe to avoid environmental stresses. Presence of R. fascians was also observed in intercellular spaces inside tissues (in leaf or galls) and even inside cell walls. Presence of R. fascians on the infected plant is necessary, not only for the initiation of infection, but also for its maintenance. =Virulence genes= Virulence in R. fascians is controlled by genes on a plasmid (strains lacking that plasmid are not virulent) and on the chromosome. Using deletion mutations, it was possible to identify three loci on the plasmid: fas, att, and hyp, and one locus on the chromosome, vic. The fas is an operon made of six genes (orf 1-6) and a regulatory gene, fasR. Because deletions of some fas genes give a non-virulent phenotype, for fas a main role in virulence was proposed . Gene fasR is an araC-like transcriptional regulator. Its transcription can be induced in vitro in cultures containing certain carbon sources (such as glucose, sucrose, arabinose, glycerol, pyruvate, mannitol, mannose) or nitrogen sources (such as histidine), and is influenced by culture pH and optical density. Also, fasR can be induced by gall extract created by virulent strain. The operon codifies for genes involved in cytokinin synthesis and degradation (orf 4,5,6), in particular for an isopentenyl transferase, a cytokinin oxidase and a glutation-s transferase. The orf1,2,3 transcribe for a cytochrome 450, a ferridoxine containing also a pyruvate dehydrogenase alfa-like domain and a pyruvate dehydrogenase beta subunit. It was supposed that the first three genes supply energy for the synthesis and degradation of cytokinin, performed by the last three genes of the operon: R. fascians can actually produce and degrade zeatin and isopentenil adenine. The compound cytokin oxidase(orf4) can also create adenine with a reactive nitrogen in position 6, which can react with other lateral chains, to form cytokininn-like compounds, more efficient in inducing plant tissue growth. The att is an operon composed of nine genes: attR, a transcriptional regulator, attX, a gene including domains for transmembrane localization (perhaps needed for exportation of compounds made by other att genes), and several genes attA-attH. Many point and Œîatt mutants show an attenuated virulence. Gene attR is a transcriptional factor including a helix-turn-helix motif. Its transcription is regulated by the same factors that regulate fasR transcription, but with a higher intensity, suggesting, with the attenuation of virulence in att mutants, that att may regulate fas transcription. Transcription of att operon is regulated with a quorum-sensing mechanism: indeed, density of cultures can influence transcription of attR, and leafy gall extracts coming from galls made by att mutant strains are less effective on transcription of attR. Genes attA-attH may be involved in synthesis of compounds needed for transcription of attR and attX. In fact, attA, attD & attH are involved in betalactamase synthesis, but no traces of those compounds were found in culture supernatants. The hyp codifies for an RNA-helicase; mutants for this gene are hypervirulent. Also, hyp is involved in post transcriptional control of virulence-related genes, maybe on fas products. Operon vic is an operon made of five genes, located on the bacterial chromosome. The only known gene is vicA, the fourth gene in the operon, whose product is a Mas homologue, a protein needed for the switch from citric acid cycle to glyoxylate cycle, both for metabolic reasons and to avoid glyoxylate accumulation, which is toxic for the bacteria. Mutations in vicA reduce virulence due to incapacity of R. fascians to resist glyoxylate accumulation. =Induction of transcription in infected plant= In tobacco, infection of R. fascians leads to hyperexpression of a cytochrome P450, homologue to a gene involved in inactivation of abscisic acid in Arabidopsis thaliana, of a gibberellic acid oxidase, which inactivates this hormone and its precursors, a proline dehydrogenase, which has its transcription induced by cytokinin and turns proline into glutamic acid, and a factor involved in molybdenum cofactor, needed for sulfur, carbon and nitrogen metabolism control and for abscisic acid synthesis. =Role of phytohormones during infection= All the effects of R. fascians infection can be attributed to hormone hyperdosage. In particular, most of the effects are connected to auxin and cytokinin, such as: formation of green islands on leaves, wrinkling of laminae, bud proliferation, delay of senescence, and inhibition of lateral roots. In fact, R. fascians can produce itself cytokinin, or cytokinin-like compounds: using orf4 and orf5 in the fas operon, it can stimulate infected plants to produce cytokinin, and it can produce indole-3-acetic acid itself, using a pathway starting from tryptophan and passing through production of 3-indol-piruvic acid and 3-indol- acetaldeid. R.fascians can also degrade cytokinin to influence the cytokinin/auxin ratio. Beside cytokinin and auxin, R. fascians acts on other hormones: in particular, it can block abscisic acid and gibberellic acid synthesis in infected plants. Abscisic acid represses growth, so a block of production is needed to allow proliferation of cells in leafy galls. Gibberellic acid controls cellular differentiation, so its block is needed for maintenance of meristematic cells and for their proliferation.  Plant diseases  R. fascians causes diseases in several host plants including tobacco, small fruits (caneberries, strawberries) and ornamental plants (butterfly flowers, Primula, kalanchoes, Impatiens, geraniums, carnations)  References  External links *Type strain of Rhodococcus fascians at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Corynebacterineae Category:Bacterial plant pathogens and diseases Category:Tobacco diseases Category:Small fruit diseases Category:Bacterial strawberry diseases Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Rhodococcus fascians"},{"id":"9845185","text":"Walter Kirby Higbe (April 8, 1915 ‚Äì May 6, 1985) was an American right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1937 to 1950. He was a two-time All-Star. He was born in Columbia, South Carolina. Career Higbe began his MLB career in 1937 with the Chicago Cubs before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in the middle of the 1939 season. A hard thrower, he was selected to the All-Star team in 1940. Following the season, he was traded again, this time to the Brooklyn Dodgers. He enjoyed his most successful season in 1941 when he went 22‚Äì9, tying teammate Whit Wyatt for the league lead in wins and finishing seventh in the MVP voting. After the 1943 season, Higbe joined the United States Army. Initially assigned to the military police, he soon received training as a rifleman and saw combat in Germany. In 1945, Higbe and his fellow soldiers went to the Philippines; however, when they arrived there, they learned that Japan had surrendered. Nonetheless, he stayed in Manila until March 1946, at which point he finally returned to the United States. That year, he posted a 17‚Äì8 record and made his second All-Star appearance (where he gave up a home run to Ted Williams), but the Dodgers lost the National League pennant to the eventual world champion St. Louis Cardinals. Higbe stayed in Brooklyn until just after the start of the 1947 campaign, when he was traded with four other players (one of whom was future Major League manager Gene Mauch) to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Al Gionfriddo. Higbe began the 1947 season with a 2‚Äì0 record for the eventual NL champion Dodgers, but he insisted upon being traded when the Dodgers added Jackie Robinson to the team as the first black major leaguer in the 20th Century. According to Higbe, the Dodger players who were opposed to having Robinson on the team \\"didn't have anything personal against Jackie Robinson or any other Negro ... but we were Southerners who had never lived or played with Negroes, and we didn't see any reason to start then.\\" After his trade to the Pirates, he collapsed to 11‚Äì17. He was traded during the 1949 season, to the New York Giants, with whom he finished his MLB career. He played in the minor leagues until 1953. Higbe died in 1985 and was buried in Columbia's Elmwood Cemetery. In the 2013 film 42, Higbe is portrayed by Brad Beyer.

He exercised strong influence over all Sherbro chiefs. Part of his fame rested in his pervasive use of the Poro Secret Society to oppose the British colonialists. He was considered so powerful that, while Bai Bureh was allowed to return from exile after the 1898 Rebellion, Kpana Lewis continued to be held in exile in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), where he died in 1912. Early life and leadership Kpana Lewis was born in 1830 in Sherbro Island in the Southern Province of British Sierra Leone to a politically dominant family of the Sherbro aristocracy. His grandfather, Bai Kong Kuba Lewis was the most dominant king among all of the Sherbro people. Kong Kuba Lewis signed a treaty ceding Sherbro country to the British in 1825, but the British did not exercise any direct authority over the Sherbros until the end of the century. Kpana Lewis assumed the leadership of the Sherbro people in 1879, after his father died. As a leader, Kpana Lewis was able to bring quite a few of the counties back under the authority of the Sherbro. He did this by using the enormous power of the Poro Secret Society, of which he was a leading member. Poro is reported to have spread into the interior of Sierra Leone from Yoni on Sherbro Island, which was the capital of the Sherbro Kingdom and where Kpana Lewis resided. He thus came to restore something of the old glory of the Kong Kuba and regained authority over former mainland provinces of the once powerful Sherbro Kingdom. When the British proclaimed a Protectorate in 1896, many of the terms of the Protectorate Ordinance were distasteful to the local rulers. Above all was the Hut Tax. Kpana Lewis was one of the few leaders who actually led a group of chiefs to the capital of Freetown to protest against the tax. While the British Governor informed him that the Sherbro in the Colony was unaffected by the tax, Kpana Lewis did not sit back and leave the other rulers to continue protesting alone because his own territory was not involved. On his return to Yoni, Kpana Lewis used the Poro to give force to his disgust with the colonial measures. Rebellion The Poro traditionally had a role of ensuring concerted action for political or economic purposes. It could as easily place a ban on war as on the harvest, a ban which no one dared disobey. It thus fulfilled the role of a modern judiciary system and police force. It was this that Kpana Lewis used to effect a boycott of trade with Europeans and the Krio people who Kpana Lewis and other indigenous tribal leaders accused of supporting the British. When the District Commissioner called a meeting of chiefs in the area to warn them against any kind of rebellion, one of the chief said that he had to confer with Kpana Lewis, whom he regarded as his leader. So great was his power and influence over these rulers that they were willing to openly defy powerful British officials in favour of Kpana Lewis' authority. The British then quickly passed a law making it a criminal offence to use the Poro to restrain trade. When the Hut Tax War of 1898 broke out, led by Temne war-chief Bai Bureh, nothing could convince the District Commissioner that Kpana Lewis was not the brain behind the resistance. Even though the British had no evidence connecting Kpana Lewis with the Rebellion, he was detained as a suspect and was subsequently sent into exile in the Gold Coast along with Bai Bureh and the Mende chief Nyagua. The British then installed their own man, Fama Yani, as the leader of the Sherbro people. Fearing that if Kpana Lewis returned and his presence would lead to the overthrow of Fama Yani, the British refused to allow his return, though Bai Bureh was ultimately brought back to Sierra Leone. Despite protests by Kpana Lewis' son, Kong Kuba, and of intervention by the Anti-Slavery Society in London, the British Government held him in the Gold Coast where he died after more than a decade in exile.

Life and career  Clapton was born in Worcester, England and read music at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied singing with David Mason and is now a pupil of Diane Forlano. He made his professional debut at the Wigmore Hall in 1984. In the following year, he was a double prize-winner at the Concurso \\"Francisco Vi√±as\\" in Barcelona, and in 1987 he won the English Song Award. Clapton is particularly known for countertenor roles in contemporary opera, the heroic castrato repertoire of the eighteenth century, and romantic art song (in partnership with the pianist Jennifer Partridge). He has performed in major opera houses and concert halls around the world, and has given over forty world premi√®res (including six operas). Unusual events in his career have included: a Purcell concert in that composer's tercentenary year in a former Palace of Culture in Siberia; playing three different reincarnations of the great castrato Farinelli; and accompanying himself on the castanets in Simon Holt's Six Caprices. In concert and oratorio, as well as major works by Bach and Handel, Clapton's repertoire includes Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder, Elgar's Sea Pictures, Vaughan Williams' Five Mystical Songs and the Verdi Requiem. Having taught for several years at Trinity College of Music in London, Nicholas Clapton was also a professor of Singing at the Royal Academy of Music until 2015. He gives regular master- classes at the Dartington International Summer School, and until 2013 was a Visiting Professor at the Zeneakad√©mia in Budapest. He has also taught in Prague, Belgrade and the Netherlands. His 2004 biography of Alessandro Moreschi was chosen by the Tablet magazine as one of its Books of the Year for 2005; (it was re-issued in a larger second edition as Moreschi and the Voice of the Castrato in 2008). In June 2005 Clapton became a Doctor of Liberal Arts of the Liszt Ferenc Music University. In 2006 he presented the documentary Castrato for BBC Four television, and curated the exhibition Handel and the Castrati at the Handel House Museum, London.

His first major employment as a musician was in 1949, where he sang on Sunday afternoons for the radio station, RHC-Cadena Azul. After the 1959 revolution, he received international acclaim with the Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional de Cuba (or National Folkloric Ensemble of Cuba) which allowed him to travel to Mexico, France, Spain, and the United States. He also worked at the Cuban Institute of Ethnology and Folklore. He is recognized as a founder of Afro-Cuban rock due to his work with the S√≠ntesis and their album, Ancestros (Ancestors).

It employed, directly and indirectly, in excess of 10,000 people, predominantly in the Asia Aluminum Industrial City which housed its primary manufacturing facilities, located in the Zhaoqing region of the People's Republic of China. Asia Aluminum made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1998. Recent Events and Decline In 2004, the Company issued Senior Notes which were listed on the Singapore Exchange, with a total principal amount of US$450,000,000. The Senior Notes were issued primarily to fund the construction of the Asia Aluminum Industrial City. In 2006, with Merrill Lynch as financial advisers, the management of Asia Aluminum performed a leveraged buyout of the outstanding issued share capital in Asia Aluminum, financed by the issuance of US$535,000,000 in payment-in-kind notes (PIK notes), which were listed on the Singapore Exchange. After acquiring all outstanding shares, Asia Aluminum was delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The global economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 had a significant negative impact on the aluminium industry, including Asia Aluminum. Furthermore, Asia Aluminum incurred a considerable drain on its cash resources due to the construction of its flat rolled products facility. At the end of 2008, the company reported its total assets to be US$2.4 billion with US$1.5 billion in liabilities. On 13 February 2009, Asia Aluminum management launched a tender offer to buy back the Senior Notes and PIK Notes at 27.5% and 13.5% of face value respectively. The offer was withdrawn after it failed to draw sufficient support from the respective noteholders. As the Company's financial condition deteriorated, it became the subject of PRC legal actions commenced by onshore creditors, which threatened its PRC assets. Demand letters were also issued against various Asia Aluminum Group entities by Hong Kong-based lenders. The demand letters triggered the cross default of the Senior Notes and the PIK Notes, causing in excess of US$985,000,000 of debt to become immediately due and payable. Asia Aluminum did not have sufficient funds to repay these debts. Consequently, as at 28 February 2009, Asia Aluminum was deemed insolvent both on a cash flow and a balance sheet basis. At the time, Asia Aluminum's total onshore and offshore debt was in the order of US$1,544,000,000.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125114222992354647 In March 2009, the company began liquidation proceedings in Hong Kong after management withdrew its tender offer for the Senior and PIK Notes. In the same month, the Hong Kong Court appointed FTI Consulting as provisional liquidator. When attempting to gain control of the Company's mainland China subsidiaries, employees of FTI Consulting reported that both management and staff had been uncooperative. Asia Aluminum's PRC assets had become under increasing threat of value deterioration due to the legal demands that had been commenced, which, if pursued, would have likely resulted in the auctioning off of the assets by the PRC Courts. Proceeds from the auction would have likely been distributed to onshore creditors first, and the likelihood of any return to offshore creditors from the PRC assets would have been significantly reduced if a return was achievable at all. In view of this threat, FTI Consulting negotiated a non-exclusive agreement with limited terms to sell 100% equity in Asia Aluminum's PRC operating assets to a management buyout consortium. This structure allowed for the potential advent of a superior offer from another party and the ability of the Provisional Liquidators to secure information from management, which had not been forthcoming, on the onshore assets. This was considered the only way to avoid a PRC bankruptcy and ensure some level of returns to offshore creditors. Despite significant media coverage of the sale, no other firm bids were tendered for Asia Aluminum's PRC assets. Norsk Hydro submitted an indicative bid for the company, but its bid was left to expire after it emerged that local authorities may oppose its bid and support a \\"restructuring proposal submitted by the management.\\" https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid;=a7CELtun0C04 Furthermore, the local authorities favoured a management buyout, as the authorities considered this the only option that would allow for social stability to be maintained in the region. The local government had negotiated a stay of local creditors and convinced local banks to allow Asia Aluminum to continue to draw on its working capital facilities. This allowed for operations to continue whilst a restructuring option could be negotiated. Therefore, any successful bidder needed to have the support of the local government and of local stakeholders. No interested parties proved to have this level of support. On June 2009, the Hong Kong Court approved for the management team to purchase Asia Aluminum for US$475,000,000, generating returns of 18 cents on the dollar to Senior Noteholders and less than one cent on the dollar to PIK Noteholders. Obligations to Hong Kong lenders and onshore creditors were fully assumed by the management buyout consortium. As is characteristic of bankruptcy situations in China, a majority of Asia Aluminum's investors were unable to fully recoup their investments, and its management team now owns the US$2.4 billion business.http://www.ifrasia.com/food-for-thought/90344.article http://www.ifrasia.com/lumena-high-yielder-rings-asia-aluminum- bells/89776.article http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15858243_ITM https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/03/16/afx6170445.html http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/06/22/daily64.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124411187608984787 Asia Aluminum is one of many bankruptcy failures of Chinese companies formerly listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

During the Stalinist era she was deported to Siberia together with her family and only arrived in Poland 6 years later. With her talented voice, spanning more than four octaves, Naumik won several competitions and prizes while still a teenager and recorded records with renowned artists such as Agnieszka Osiecka and Adam Slawinski. Having graduated from the Pedagogy Institute in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1969, she moved to Norway in 1970 after marrying Norwegian film director Haakon Sand√∏y. Following her move to Norway, Naumik resumed her music career, adopting the stage name Alex. The stage name itself was created and given by writer Jens Bj√∏rneboe, who dedicated on his novel \\"Powderhouse\\" (Krutt√•rnet in Norw.) - ¬´To little Alex from old Jens¬ª. Her eponymous 1977 debut album launched funk-rock in Norway while her album received both critical acclaim and the Norwegian Album of the Year award, also selling to both silver and gold records. Her first band, also named \\"Alex\\", was formed in 1976 together with Bj√∏rn Christiansen, Svein Gundersen (from the earlier noted Rock group Aunt Mary), Brynjulf Blix and Per Ivar Johansen. She was also the first Norwegian artist to sign international recording contracts in 1977 with PolyGram International (now Universal Music Group) and in 1978 with RCA Records, working with artists such as David Foster, Andrae Crouch, Andy Summers and Glen Matlock. In addition to performing all over the world, Alex was also given her own television special in the German Musikladen series, which was viewed by 20 million people in over 18 countries worldwide. During the early 80s, Naumik took part in Melodi Grand Prix, the Norwegian national finals of the Eurovision Song Contest, on four occasions, with her third place in 1980 as her best result. That same year, she and her band were involved in a bus crash, which killed her drummer, Per Ivar Johansen, and seriously injured several other members. Following the peak of her popularity in the mid-80s, Naumik gradually turned to producing records and writing material for other artists, spending several years working in both the United States and Japan, before returning to Norway in the early 2000s. During this time, Naumik only released two albums herself, in 1991 and -93. Her most recent success was her work with Swedish-born artist Leana's album Faith, which reached number one on the Billboard charts in June 2006 and January 2007. She contributed as a writer and producer along with her daughter, Naomi Naumik, and her collaborator for 25 years, Grammy winner Atle Bakken. In October 2008, Naumik began re-releasing her recordings, both digitally and on CD, marking her debut on iTunes, Spotify, and her own website. At the same time, several brand new recordings and remixes were released. During her lifetime, Naumik received several international prizes and distinctions in addition to national ones. These have included the \\"Nordring\\" prize in Helsinki (1981), Spellemansprisen, the Norwegian Grammy (1977), for two albums, and being voted \\"Female Artist of the Year\\" by the readers of Det Nye magazine in 1980 = Image = Alex also became renowned as a trend-setter in several areas (\\"Alex-hair\\" was a common expression) and she became the first female artist in Norway to take full control over her music, personal and public image at a time when an independent female artist was unusual. As she was also a pioneer in co-operation between the music and commercial sector and became a spokesperson for Helen Curtis Shampoos, BASF, Levi's and Ford Motor Company amongst others. = Personal life and death = Naumik married Norwegian film director Haakon Sand√∏y in 1969, but they later divorced. She spent most of her life, including her final years, in Oslo, but also lived in USA, Japan and Sweden. On September 17, 2013, Naumik was found dead in her Oslo apartment. She was 64.

It is among the composer's best-known works. At the same time it is a prominent example for a piece of chamber music deviating strongly from the customary form of classical chamber music ‚Äì both in terms of the number of movements and of their formal construction. Title Dumky, the plural form of dumka, is a term introduced into Slavic languages from the Ukrainian. Originally, it is the diminutive form of the term Duma, plural dumy, which refers to epic ballads, specifically a song or lament of captive people.Keller, James. Chamber Music: A Listener's Guide. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. During the nineteenth century, composers from other Slavic countries began using the duma as a classical form used to indicate a brooding, introspective composition with cheerful sections interspersed within. Dvo≈ô√°k used the dumka form in several other compositions, including his Dumka for Solo Piano, Op. 35; Slavonic Dance No. 2; String Sextet; and his Piano Quintet, Op. 81 History Dvo≈ô√°k completed the trio on 12 February 1891. It premiered in Prague on 11 April 1891, with violinist Ferdinand Lachner, cellist Hanu≈° Wihan, and Dvo≈ô√°k himself on piano. The same evening, Prague's Charles University awarded the composer an honorary doctorate. The work was so well received that Dvo≈ô√°k performed it on his forty-concert farewell tour throughout Moravia and Bohemia, just before he left for the United States to head the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. The trio was published while Dvo≈ô√°k was in America and was proofread by his friend Johannes Brahms. Structure The piece is in six sections: The composition features six dumky episodes throughout. The initial three dumky are connected together without interruption in the harmonically complementary keys given above, in effect forming a long first movement. The final three dumky are presented in unrelated keys, thus giving the overall impression of a four-movement structure.Ulrich, Homer (1966). Chamber Music, 2nd Edition. Columbia University Press. Music critic Daniel Felsenfeld describes the form as follows: > The form of the piece is structurally simple but emotionally complicated, > being an uninhibited Bohemian lament. Considered essentially formless, at > least by classical standards, it is more like a six movement dark > fantasia‚Äîcompletely original and successful, a benchmark piece for the > composer. Being completely free of the rigors of sonata form gave Dvo≈ô√°k > license to take the movements to some dizzying, heavy, places, able to be > both brooding and yet somehow, through it all, a little lighthearted. > Felsenfeld, Daniel (2006). \\"Dvo≈ô√°k Chamber Music\\". In Dvo≈ô√°k Trios (p. 4) > [CD booklet]. New York: Koch Records. Musicologists Derek Katz and Michael Beckerman observe, \\"Whereas in the quintet [Op. 81] he had borrowed a plan from Schumann to mold his dumka into a quasi-traditional framework, here he allows each of the six dumky to stand fully realized on its own.\\"Katz, Derek and Beckerman, Michael (2004). \\"The Chamber Music of Smetana and Dvo≈ô√°k.\\" In Nineteenth Century Chamber Music, Stephen Hefling, ed.

WoodsThe National Bank of Commerce was a U.S. bank of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It first chartered as the Kansas City Savings Bank in 1865. After a controlling interest was acquired by Dr. William Stone Woods in 1881, the bank became active in financing the regional growth of Kansas City and areas to the southwest, especially in connection with the development of the city as a center of railroad transportation and distribution. Before establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, business in the United States depended on a system of private banks which in turn used correspondent banks in larger cities to provide credit and liquidity. The National Bank of Commerce was the principal correspondent bank for bank clearings in the area southwest of Chicago and St. Louis. Because of this role, Commerce was at one point among the 20 largest banks in the United States, as measured by assets. A casualty of the Panic of 1907, the National Bank of Commerce was placed into receivership by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on December 5, 1907, after a six-week series of runs on the bank. The bank paid out its depositors in full and after recapitalization was returned to its previous owners. The National Bank of Commerce was later merged into the Commerce Trust Company, which became Commerce Bank of Kansas City, now part of Commerce Bancshares.

General / Background Hausa Sign Language (HSL) or Maganar hannu is the language of the deaf community in northern Nigeria. There are no statistics on the number of deaf people in northern Nigeria or in Nigeria in general or on the number of people who use Hausa Sign Language. Estimates as to the number of signers using this language \\"vary greatly, from 70,000 to five million\\".Schmaling, Constanze. 2015. Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook, Julie Bakken Jepsen, Goedele De Clerck, Sam Lutalo-Kiingi, William B. McGregor, (eds.), 362-390. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614518174 There is no information on the origin of Hausa Sign Language, but it is believed that deaf people have always used HSL for communication. Hausa Sign Language is not taught formally in schools but is handed down from one generation to the next. Deaf children learn it from their parents, from their peers or other members of the deaf community. HSL is constantly enriched whenever deaf people meet, whether informally or in schools, associations or other groups. Linguistic structure Hausa Sign Language is a language in its own right with its own lexicon and grammar. It can be analysed linguistically like other spoken and sign languages. The HSL lexicon does, however, include loanwords from spoken Hausa, the surrounding major spoken language. Even though HSL grammar differs from spoken Hausa language grammar, there are influences from the spoken language in some users. HSL signs are articulated by the hands. Each sign is composed of a number of components that are called the manual parameters, i.e. handshape, orientation, movement, and location. A sign may be articulated by one hand or both. Body posture and movement as well as facial expressions and other non-manual parameters play a role as well. They may be inherent parts of signs but may also be used to express grammatical features, e.g. question markers and emphasis.Sign for Maganar hannu (Hausa Sign Language) in Hausa Sign Language References Further reading *Schmaling, Halima C. 2020.

As a historian, he also headed the Institute of History of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences for many years. Bunyadov was a World War II veteran and Hero of the Soviet Union. Life Ziya Bunyadov was born on December 21, 1923 in the town of Astara in Azerbaijan. His father, originally from Bibiheybat village of Baku, was a Custom Officer and, due to his work, the Bunyadov family changed their residence several times. After finishing secondary (high) school in Goychay in 1939, he joined Baku military school. In 1942 he was sent to World War II to fight on the Caucasus Front, near the town of Mozdok. The Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), the official newspaper of the Soviet Army, wrote about Bunyadov in 1942: \\"sly, swift as a tiger, the intelligence officer Ziya Bunyadov, who under the improbable conditions, in the most complex situation could clearly orient himself, bring precise data about the number, the armament and the dislocation of the enemy. He was valued in the battalion for the romantic soul and the literary erudition\\" . He went on to fight on the European Front and participated in the Soviet capture of Warsaw and Berlin. Ziya Bunyadov was awarded the Soviet Union's highest military honor, the Hero of the Soviet Union, for his action in the battle over a bridge on Pilica river in Poland on January 14, 1945, resulting in 100 enemy fatalities and 45 enemy prisoners taken. As well as this medal, for his participation and heroism in World War II Ziya Bunyadov was also awarded the honorary Red Banner, Red Star, Alexander Nevsky, and 2nd degree Patriotic War. For a year after the end of war, Lieutenant Ziya Bunyadov was deputy military commandant of the Pankow district of Berlin. Academic career After the war, Ziya Bunyadov graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies and in 1954 defended his doctorate dissertation. Dr. Bunyadov returned to Baku and started working at the Institute of the History of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan SSR. Here he progressed from the position of research associate to become a chief scientist, head of the Institute of History, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and then finally full academician and vice-president of the Academy of Sciences. He was the author and editor of numerous monographs, books, and articles on the history of Caucasus. Soviet orientalist and journalist Farid Seyful-Mulukov noted regarding Bunyadov's translation of the Quran: \\"He was an outstanding scholar. Quran translation requires excellent knowledge of the Arabic language and few dare to embark upon that job. Ziya Bunyadov managed to do excellent translation of the Holy Book.\\"Zerkalo, Baku, 14 March 2007 Death Ziya Bunyadov's burying place in Alley of Honor On February 21, 1997, Ziya Bunyadov was murdered at the entrance to his apartment in Baku. Though the official state investigation placed the responsibility on a group of Islamic extremists, many of whom received life sentences, the culprits and circumstances of Bunyadov's murder remained mysterious. According to John W. Parker, chief of the Division for Caucasus and Central Asia within the U.S. State Department, Bunyadov's murderers were trained in Iran.John W. Parker, Persian Dreams: Moscow and Tehran Since the Fall of the Shah, (Potomac Books, Inc, 2009), 54. He was buried at the Alley of Honor. Critics Bunyadov researched ancient and medieval Azerbaijani historiography, specializing in Caucasian Albania and Azerbaijan during the Arab caliphate rule, concentrating on events from the 7th-19th centuries AD. In different areas, Bunyadov's work has met severe criticism. According to journalist Thomas de Waal: > \\"Buniatov's academy reissued thirty thousand copies of a forgotten racist > tract by the turn of the century Russian polemicist Vasil Velichko; later > Buniatov began a poisonous quarrel for which Caucasian Albanians themselves > should take none of them blame. Buniatov‚Äôs scholarly credentials were > dubious. It later transpired that the two articles he published in 1960 and > 1965 on Caucasian Albania were direct plagiarism. Under his own name, he had > simply published, unattributed, translations of two articles, originally > written in English by Western scholars C.F.J. Dowsett and Robert > Hewsen.\\"Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War, by > Thomas De Waal (Aug 25, 2004), pages 152-153, 143 Bunyadov is also known for his article, \\"Why Sumgait?\\",\\"Why Sumgayit?

Thomas de Waal calls Bunyadov \\"Azerbaijan‚Äôs foremost Armenophobe,\\" and says, \\"Buniatov concluded that the Sumgait pogroms had been planned by the Armenians themselves in order to discredit Azerbaijan and boost the Armenian nationalist cause.\\"Black Garden, by Thomas De Waal (Aug 25, 2004), page 42 (see Sumgait pogrom#Conspiracy theories). According to Russian historian V. Shnirelman, Bunyadov \\"purposefully tried \\"to clear\\" the territories of modern Azerbaijan from the presence of Armenian history\\". \\"Another way is to underestimate the presence of Armenians in ancient and medieval Transcaucasia and to belittle their role by reprinting antique and medieval sources with denominations and replacements of the \\"Armenian state\\" term to \\"the Albanian state\\" or with other distortions of original texts.

After the raid of August 26, 1896 carried out by the Armenian nationalist committees, Ber√ß Keresteciyan was sent by his European supervisors as precaution to Cairo, Egypt as branch manager along with some other non-Muslim middle level officials. He worked also in the ƒ∞zmir branch. As the Turkish Red Crescent () was re-established for the third and last time in 1911, Ber√ß Keresteciyan was a co-founder, became the only non-Muslim member of the executive committee and later vice chairman of the humanitarian institution. With the outbreak of World War I and the participation of the Ottoman Empire in the war, the Bank's officials of British and French nationality fell in the position of citizens of hostile countries. The Ottomans threatened the Bank with confiscation, and the general manager and his deputy had to leave their posts and the country until the end of the war. The administration was taken over by non-Muslim Ottomans. Ber√ß Keresteciyan was among them. He was deputy general manager and later became general manager of the Bank. He served for a period as a Deputy at the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Ottoman Parliament. Turkish War of Independence An anecdote is being told about his contribution to save the life of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, as he informed Atat√ºrk's lawyer about a British plot to sink his ship SS Bandƒ±rma in the Black Sea, on which Atat√ºrk left Constantinople (today-Istanbul) in 1919 to initiate the Turkish War of Independence. He was awarded the white stripe Medal of Independence after the war. In 1923, Ber√ß Keresteciyan sent a telegram to Atat√ºrk in his capacity as the honorary president of the Turco-Armenian Friendship Association and a member of the secular council of the Armenian Patriarchate, confirming the loyalty and the support of his community to the political authority of the government in Ankara. Following the surname reform on June 21, 1934, Atat√ºrk gave Ber√ß Keresteciyan the family name T√ºrker (Turkish for Turk man) for his patriotism. Political career Encouraged and supported by Atat√ºrk, he run as an independent candidate for a deputy seat from Afyonkarahisar at the 1935 general elections and became a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly on March 7, 1935 as the first Armenian and one of the four non-Muslims in total. The same day, he also became a member of the economic commission of the parliament thanks to his expertise. He repeated his membership of the parliament twice more after the general elections in 1939 and 1943. During his political career in the parliament, Ber√ß T√ºrker Keresteciyan made significant contributions to issues of general political, economic, social and international developments. After his retirement in 1947, he lived at B√ºy√ºkada, Istanbul. Ber√ß T√ºrker Keresteciyan died in Istanbul, on 27 July 1949, and interred on 29 July in the same city.

In 1999, during Kinchla's time playing in a band called Smit-Haus, Blues Traveler's original bassist Bobby Sheehan died. This left an opening in the band for a new bassist. Kinchla was one of five bassists to try out for the spot. He was the first to audition, with auditions being held live in concert at a New York bar called Bar Bat, and not in a studio. His audition was the first band performance after the death of Sheehan and came with no rehearsal. In 2006, Kinchla also joined Blues Traveler frontman John Popper in a side project called the John Popper Project. In 2006, they released an eponymous album with DJ Logic.

Technical description and variation It has a wingspan of about 44 mm. The wings are ample; the forewing angled in the middle of the termen, concave between the angle and the acute apex. Forewing grey mixed with ochreous, with fuscous striae, posteriorly with a rosy tinge: the veins terminally whitish; an irregular median suffusion reaching from base to middle, orange red more or less mixed with yellow; inner and outer lines pale with dark edges; a white spot at base on median vein; a white dot represents the orbicular stigma; reniform formed of two black dots; hindwing fuscous, paler at base; ab. suffusa Tutt is a scarce dark form without the usual rosy tinge in the terminal area of forewing; ab. pallidior Spul. includes pale whitish grey looking examples; while pallida Spul. refers to pale more yellowish specimens from Turkestan.Seitz, A.

During the winter the herald moth hibernates in dark, cool structures (e.g. cellars, barns and caves), returning to take wing again from March to June. Its habitat is woodland parks and gardens, and (perhaps consequently) the resting wing pattern resembles a dead, shrivelled leaf. Herald caterpillars are a bright green shade common to many caterpillars. They are distinguished by the thin yellow lines running across the body between segments. When maturity is reached, they pupate between two leaves, in a white cocoon made of silk.

It depicts a group of distinguished Victorians visiting the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1881, just after the death of the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, whose portrait by John Everett Millais was included on a screen at the special request of Queen Victoria (visible in the archway at the back of the room). The room is Gallery III, the largest and most imposing room at Burlington House. Frith worked on the painting through much of 1881 and 1882. He later said in My Autobiography and Reminiscences, published in 1887, that \\"Beyond the desire of recording for posterity the aesthetic craze as regards dress, I wished to hit the folly of listening to self-elected critics in matters of taste, whether in dress or art. I therefore planned a group, consisting of a well-known apostle of the beautiful, with a herd of eager worshippers surrounding him.\\" Meaning and content The subject of the painting is the contrast between lasting historical achievements and ephemeral fads. The portrait of Disraeli represents the former, and the influence of the Aesthetic movement in dress represents the latter. Aesthetic dress is exemplified by the principal female figures, to the left, in green, pink and orange clothing. Oscar Wilde, one of the main proponents of Aestheticism, is depicted at the right behind the boy in the green suit, with signature lily buttonhole, surrounded by female admirers. Behind Wilde, further to the right, a group of opponents glare disapprovingly at him as he speaks: painters Philip Calderon and Henry Stacy Marks, sculptor Joseph Boehm, and journalist G.A. Sala (bare-headed, in white waistcoat). To the left, behind and immediately to the right of Wilde, are the actors Henry Irving and Ellen Terry,Mary Cowling, Frith and his Followers, William Powell Frith: Painting the Victorian Age, 2007, p. 70 with Frederick A. Eaton. To Wilde's left are Lillie Langtry, in a white dress, beside the soberly-dressed William Thomson, Archbishop of York. The man with sideburns looking over Thompson's left shoulder is William Agnew, picture dealer and recently elected Liberal MP for South East Lancashire, next to Lord Chief Justice of England Sir John Coleridge.Christie's notes on a sketch; sold for ¬£139,250 in December 2008 In the centre of the composition, bearded and dressed in a brown frock coat, stands Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, talking to a seated woman, Constance, Countess of Lonsdale. The head of surgeon Sir Henry Thompson appears between Leighton and the Countess. Frith himself appears in the centre of the painting, bare-headed and whiskered, directly below the painting of Disraeli, talking to two women behind the seat. One of the two women on the other side of the seat, facing away from Leighton, is the heiress and philanthropist Baroness Burdett-Coutts. Having remained a spinster until she was sixty-six, Baroness Burdett-Coutts provoked a scandal in 1881 by marrying her much younger secretary, the American William Ashmead-Bartlett, who became Mr Burdett-Coutts. Baroness Burdett-Coutts is shown in conversation with the younger Lady Diana Huddleston, daughter of William Beauclerk, 9th Duke of St Albans. Their husbands also appear among the standing figures behind the seat. Lady Diana's husband was Sir John Walter Huddleston, the last Baron of the Exchequer and a judge of Queen's Bench. He wears a top hat, and stands just behind and to the left of poet and playwright Robert Browning, the bare-headed and white-bearded figure seen talking to an unknown woman in a green dress. To the right, listening to Browning's conversation, is naturalist Thomas Huxley (probably included due to his trenchant support for Charles Darwin, who had died in 1882). Mr Burdett-Coutts stands behind and to the right of Huxley, reading, with moustache and top hat. At the left of the painting stands the \\"homely figure\\" of Anthony Trollope (who died on 6 December 1882), with full white beard and top hat, noting in a book as he gazes at an \\"aesthetic\\" family in the foreground to the right, comprising a woman in green with sunflower buttonhole gazing at the artworks (a professional model, Jenny TripWilliam Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age; Mark Bills, Vivien Knight, Guildhall Art Gallery, Mercer Art Gallery; Yale University Press, 2006; , p.70), a woman in yellow reading her catalogue, and a girl in orange looking up at her. Frith describes them as \\"a family of pure aesthetes absorbed in affected study of the pictures\\" with Trollope affording \\"a striking contrast to the eccentric forms near him.\\" Cartoonist George du Maurier, with moustache and hat, stands immediately behind; to the left, behind him, hatless, is illustrator John Tenniel. Further left, between Trollope and the edge of the painting, are novelist Mary Elizabeth Braddon and musician Sir Julius Benedict. To the right behind Trollope are a group of four politicians ‚Äì the right-most, the Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, faces a bearded Sir Henry Stafford Northcote; the tall hatless man behind Gladstone is Home Secretary Sir William Harcourt; behind and to the left of Northcote is Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster John Bright. The paintings on the wall accurately reproduce the exhibits at the 1881 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. A second portrait of Disraeli is visible on the wall behind Langtry. On the wall at the right, above Wilde's opponents, is the similarly angry-looking central figure in John Collier's Last Voyage of Henry Hudson. Millais at the extreme right is looking at Lawrence Alma-Tadema's painting Sappho and Alcaeus, accompanied by a myopic connoisseur. On the left wall are Heywood Hardy's Sidi Ahmed ben Avuda and the Holy Lion to the left; James Sant's Daughters of Arthur Wilson, Esq. further right, and John William Waterhouse's A Summer's Day in Italy.  Sale  The work remained in the Pope family until it was sold at auction by Martin Beilsy Fine Art in April 2019.

Influences One of Du Maurier's satires on fashion Watteau, L'Enseigne de Gersaint (1720-21) Frith was inspired by the satirical cartoons of George du Maurier (whose head is visible between the orange and green attired aesthetes at the left) and by Gilbert and Sullivan's popular operetta Patience, first performed in 1881. The aesthetic costumes are characterised by features such as gigot sleeves and the \\"Watteau pleats\\" seen in the figure to the left of Wilde, wearing pink. The women in the centre along with the one to the right of Wilde with the child represent normal fashionable clothing of the day.Edwina Ehrman, Frith and Fashion, William Powell Frith: Painting the Victorian Age, 2007, pp. 111‚Äì129 These aspects of dress and pose, along with the myopic figure next to Millais, show the influence of Watteau's 1720-21 painting L'Enseigne de Gersaint. In Harrogate A Private View was exhibited on tour. At Harrogate, North Yorkshire, Frith's childhood home, it went on show at Messrs A & J Polak's, with visitors paying one shilling to see \\"W P Frith's Last Great Picture\\". Frith's study for A Private View, 1881, is in the Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate.\\"Study for The Private View\\" in the Mercer Art Gallery Collection, Harrogate This sketch offers a rare insight into the artist's working methods and also provides a snapshot of the buzz and excitement of the flourishing Victorian art world.

Mount Hope (Montaup) is the small hill across the bay in Bristol, Rhode Island Mount Hope Bay is a tidal estuary located at the mouth of the Taunton River on the Massachusetts and Rhode Island border. It is an arm of Narragansett Bay. The bay is named after Mount Hope, a small hill located on its western shore in what is now Bristol, Rhode Island. It flows into the East Passage of Narragansett Bay and also the Sakonnet River. Mount Hope Bay has played an important role to the history of the area, from pre-colonial times to the present. While many years of sewage and industrial pollution have severely degraded the quality of the shallow waters of the bay, there are currently major efforts underway to clean up and restore it. Geography Mount Hope Bay is part of the Narragansett Basin, formed as a rift in the Avalon terrane. It is underlaid by sedimentary rocks estimated to be several miles thick.Roadside Geology of Massachusetts, James W. Skehan, 2001 The bay covers an area of about 13 square miles (36 square km), with an average depth of 18.7 feet,EPA Report Brayton Point although portions of the southern end of the bay are as deep as 74 feet near the Mount Hope Bridge.NOAA Chart 13226 At the north end of the bay are the towns of Warren, Rhode Island, Swansea, Massachusetts, and Somerset, Massachusetts. The eastern shore of the bay consists of the city of Fall River, Massachusetts and the town of Tiverton, Rhode Island. Portsmouth, Rhode Island is located at the southern end of the bay at the northern tip of Aquidneck Island. Bristol, Rhode Island forms the western shore of the bay. Approximately 70 percent of the bay is located within Rhode Island. However, nearly 90 percent of its drainage area is located within Massachusetts.Mount Hope Bay Kickemuit River Wet Weather Bacteria Sampling 2006 Rhode Island DEM Its main tributary is the Taunton River, and several smaller rivers drain directly into the bay, including the Quequechan River, Lee's River, Cole River, and Kickamuit River. A small sand bar known as Spar Island is located in the middle of the bay just south of the Rhode Island border. The perimeter of the bay is crossed by three roadway bridges: the Sakonnet River Bridge to the southeast, the Charles M. Braga Jr. Memorial Bridge to the north, and the Mount Hope Bridge to the southwest. Mount Hope Bay contains a 35 foot-deep shipping channel maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of their Fall River Harbor project.Fall River Harbor, ACOE A privately maintained, 34 feet-deep channel extends from the main ACOE channel to the Brayton Point Power Station.NOAA Chart 13226 History Mount Hope Bay was once part of the Wampanoag Nation, and the site of early events of King Philip's War in 1675. For nearly 200 years, the area of the bay was part of a boundary dispute between the states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, which was finally settled by the United States Supreme Court in 1862. Mount Hope Bay has played an important part in the industrial history of the city of Fall River, which is located on its eastern shore. The bay provides access to the city for ocean-going vessels, including for many years the passenger ships of the Fall River Line. In the 1960s, the 1,500 megawatt Brayton Point Power Station was built by the New England Power Company in Somerset, Massachusetts at the north end of the bay. It has the largest capacity of any power plant in New England. For many years, the plant has relied on the waters of the bay as part of its cooling process. This has led to severe thermal pollution, resulting in periodic fish kills. After years of lawsuits and various environmental government action, current owner Dominion Resources spent approximately $500 million building two 500-foot tall cooling towers and upgrading the cooling system to prevent pollution of the bay.Dominion-Brayton Point Power Station EPA Brayton Point Station: Final NPDES Permit The Brayton Point Cooling Towers were demolished in April of 2019. In 2009, the City of Fall River completed the first phase of a $185 million Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) abatement project, designed to drastically reduce the amount of sewage overflows that occur during periods of heavy rains. The project is expected to be completed by 2018.

A Turk appeared and said she must come to his master and be punished. He brought them underground, where a green bird appeared, washed in milk, and became a man. The Turk told what had happened. The father said that there was no sign that the radish had belonged to him. The man married Rosella and gave her father a sack of gold. One day, while the man was away, her sisters visited her. She told them that her husband had forbidden her to ask who he was, but they persuaded her to ask his name. He told her that he was the King of Love and vanished. She wandered in search of him, calling for him, and an ogress appeared, demanding to know why Rosella called on her nephew. The ogress took pity on her and let her stay the night, telling her that she was one of seven sister ogresses, and the worst was her mother-in-law. Each day, Rosella met another; on the seventh day, a sister of the King of Love told Rosella to climb her hair into the house while their mother was out. Then she and her sisters told Rosella to seize their mother and pinch her until the ogress cried out to be left alone in her son's name. Rosella did this, and the ogress wanted to eat her, but the ogress's daughters stopped her. Then she insisted that Rosella carry a letter for her. In the wilderness, Rosella called on the King of Love again. He warned her to flatter things along the way: to drink from and praise two rivers, to eat and praise fruit from an orchard, to eat bread from an oven and praise it, to feed two dogs, to sweep a hall, and to polish a knife, razor and scissors. Then she was to deliver the letter, seize a box from the table, and run. When she did this, the ogress called after her for things to destroy her, but they refused because of her kindness. Curious, she opened the box; musical instruments escaped, and she had to call on her husband again to get them back. The ogress wanted to eat Rosella again but her daughters stopped her again. She ordered her to fill a mattress with feathers from all the birds in the air. The King of Love got the King of Birds to have the birds fill the mattress. Then the ogress married her son to the daughter of the King of Portugal, and had Rosella hold the torches for the bridal chamber; but the king got his bride to switch places with Rosella, and the ground opened up and swallowed the bride. The ogress declared that Rosella's child would not be born until she unclasped her hands. The King of Love had his body laid out as if he were dead, and his sisters lamented him. The ogress unclasped her hands, demanding to know how he had died. Rosella's son was born. This so enraged the ogress that she died.

The film, a Don Quixote and Miravista Films production, is a retelling of Charles Dickens' classic 1838 novel Oliver Twist, set in a New York City contemporary underground populated by drag queens, drug abusers and hustlers. The film was an official selection and debuted in 1997 at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival, and was also screened as an official selection at the Seattle International Film Festival. Donsky's film was made prior to Jacob Tierney's similar film Twist, starring American actor Nick Stahl. Donsky's Twisted was re-discovered by the Museum of Modern Art in 2013, included in their Charles Dickens bicentenary film series and subsequently accepted into their permanent film collection. Synopsis William Hickey stars as Andre, a lecherous brothel owner who trades in young men. Exploiting his young charges through paternalism and drugs, Andre sets his sights on Lee (Keivyn McNeil Graves), a ten-year-old, black, runaway orphan. Through Andre, Lee quickly becomes immersed in New York's sleazy underbelly of a drug dealer (Anthony Crivello stars as \\"Eddie\\") and street hustlers. The boy's only hope for survival is the aspiring songwriter Angel (David Norona), himself a former hustler. Angel befriends Lee and rescues him from the wiles of Andre's cohort Fine Art (Jean Loup Wolfman), who attempts to profit on Lee's tender age. Eventually, Andre's petty empire is vanquished by Shiniqua (Billy Porter), a powerfully wise and glamorous drag queen whose fiercely maternal spirit is every bit the match for the depraved denizens of the brothel.TLA Video's Twisted page  Cast  * William Hickey as Andre, brothel owner * Anthony Crivello as Eddie, drug dealer * David Noro√±a as Angel, Eddie's boyfriend * Keivyn McNeill Graves as Lee, black runaway orphan * Billy Porter as Shiniqua, drag queen and Angel's friend * Jean Loup Wolfman as Arthur 'Fine Art', a hustler * Ray Aranha as Black Can Man * Elizabeth Franz as Mrs. Bundrass, social Worker * Simon Brook as Undercover Cop * Erik Jensen as Punk * Brenda Pressley as Mrs. Burns, Lee's foster mother * Eugene Byrd as Willus, Mrs. Burns' son * Keisha Howard as Laylene, Willus Burn's girlfriend * Lynn Tanner as Celine Holland, a district attorney * Kelly Coyle as Arthur's Girlfriend * Rose Baum Senerchia as Andre's Mother * Angelo Berkowitz as Brothel Boy * Giovanni Giaconi as Taxi driver * Ross Haines as Arresting Officer Awards and recognition Twisted was an official selection at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival and the Seattle International Film Festival.

Written in the first person, it is a self-examination by an English painter, Samuel Mountjoy, held in a German POW camp during World War II. Plot summary Samuel ('Sammy') Mountjoy, a talented painter but a directionless and unhappy man, is a prisoner of war in Germany during World War II. Recently some inmates escaped from his camp. A Gestapo officer, Dr. Halde, interviews Sammy in an attempt to find out about the escape organisation; when Sammy denies knowing anything, Halde has him locked in a small store-room, awaiting possible torture. Under the pressure of the darkness, isolation and horrified anticipation he gradually breaks down; in a series of long flashbacks, he wonders what brought him to his current state, and in particular, how he lost his freedom. As a very young child he was happy, despite living in a slum and never knowing his father. He was adopted by the local priest and attended day school and grammar school, where he was torn between two diametrically opposed parent-figures ‚Äì the kindly science master Nick Shales and the sadistic Rowena Pringle, who taught religious studies. He also fell desperately in love with a girl in his class, Beatrice Ifor. Whilst a student at art college he managed to become Beatrice's fianc√©, and eventually her lover, but when she was unable to return his violent passion he grew bored with her and married another woman. After some years he found that Beatrice had gone incurably insane. The novel alternates these flashbacks with Sammy's increasing terror and despair. Then, just as he loses all self-control and cries for help, he is abruptly released by the camp commandant, who apologises, outraged that an officer should have been humiliated like this. Characters * Samuel Mountjoy is the narrator. He is a talented and renowned painter ('I hang in the Tate') but a confused, restless and unhappy man. Despite searching for some meaning in life (for example, by joining the Communist Party) he has never found anything satisfying: 'I have hung all systems on the wall like a row of useless hats. They do not fit... That Marxist hat in the middle of the row, did I ever think it would last me a lifetime? What is wrong with the Christian biretta that I hardly wore at all?' Throughout the book he is constantly wondering where he lost the freedom he remembers as a child: > When did I lose my freedom? For once, I was free... Free-will cannot be > debated but only experienced, like a colour or the taste of potatoes. I > remember one such experience. I was very small and I was sitting on the > stone surround of the pool and fountain in the centre of the park... The > gravelled paths of the park radiated from me: and all at once I was overcome > by a new knowledge. I could take whichever I would of these paths... * Doctor Halde is the Gestapo officer who interviews Sammy and has him locked in the store-room. Before the war he was a professor of psychiatry. In the last line of the book, the camp commandant, apologising to Sammy for this humiliating treatment, says 'The Herr Doctor does not know about peoples' ‚Äì which is ironic, as it's clear that Halde is an extremely acute judge of character. * Father Watts-Watt is the Anglican priest who adopts Sammy. He has paedophilic impulses which he represses violently and which cause him eventually to sink into paranoia. * Johnny Spragg is one of Sammy's school friends. He is a simple, extrovert, cheerful child who wants only to become a pilot. He is killed flying in the war. Sammy envies him for his 'natural goodness and generosity'. * Philip Arnold is Sammy's other main school friend. He is subtle, cunning and cynical (the exact opposite of Johnny). Like Sammy, he is driven to understand the world. He wants to dismiss religion as a mere charade, and persuades Sammy to agree to urinate on the local church altar, to see if there is any 'divine retribution'. (Sammy eventually just spits on it.) * Beatrice Ifor is the girl with whom Sammy falls in love. She has what seems to him a wonderful calm and self-possession, but eventually it emerges that this is really a result of her mental fragility ‚Äì she is borderline schizophrenic and eventually breaks down altogether. Sammy, filled with guilt, can never be sure whether their relationship hastened or postponed her mental collapse. * Rowena Pringle is the religion teacher at Sammy's grammar school. She is a hateful figure: 'She ruled, not by love, but by fear. Her weapons were no cane, they were different, subtle and cruel, unfair and vicious. They were teeny, arch sarcasms that made the other children giggle and tore the flesh...' * Nick Shales is the science master at Sammy's school. He is a kindly and decent man: 'Nick was the best teacher I ever knew. He had no particular method and gave no particular picture of brilliance; it was just that he had a vision of nature and a passionate desire to communicate it.' Looking back, Sammy decides that the real loss of his freedom occurred when he was forced to choose between the two worlds of science and religion, and chose the rational, scientific one, against his real nature, because Shales was kind to him whilst Miss Pringle was not:- > I do not believe that rational choice stood any chance of exercise. I > believe that my child's mind was made up for me as a choice between good and > wicked fairies. Miss Pringle vitiated her teaching. She failed to convince, > not by what she said, but by what she was. Nick persuaded me to his natural > scientific universe by what he was, not by what he said. I hung for an > instant between two pictures of the universe; then the ripple passed over > the burning bush and I ran towards my friend...

StormReady is a community preparedness program in the United States that encourages government entities and commercial gathering sites to prepare for severe storms. The program, sponsored by the United States National Weather Service, issues recognition to communities and sites across the country that demonstrate severe weather readiness. The program is voluntary, and provides communities with clear-cut advice from a partnership with the local National Weather Service Office, state and local emergency managers, and the media. The program has been credited with saving the lives of more than 50 movie-goers in Van Wert County, Ohio in November 2002. As of June 1, 2011, there were 1,752 StormReady sites in 50 states. History and background The National Weather Service's StormReady Poster The United States experiences, on average, about 10,000 thunderstorms, 5,000 floods, and 1,000 tornadoes, as well as an average of 2 deadly hurricanes, each year. Some 90% of all presidentially-declared disaster areas are weather-related, leading to around 500 deaths per year and nearly $14 billion in damage. StormReady was initiated in 1999 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in an area which has experienced a number of severe tornadoes; there has been at least one tornado in the Tulsa area each year since 1950. Its sponsors saw formal recognition as a way to increase cooperation among the various agencies responsible for disaster preparedness. The program was originally called StormWise; in 2002, the StormReady logo and name became officially registered trademarks of the National Weather Service. The program has increased its scope at a steady rate ever since. Walt Disney World received the recognition in 2006. The sites in June 2011 comprised 874 counties, 721 communities, 72 universities, 10 Native American tribal nations, 37 commercial sites, and 36 military/government sites. A TsunamiReady program has been instituted using many of the same criteria. There are currently 84 TsunamiReady Sites in 10 states, Puerto Rico and Guam and 144 StormReady Supporters Recognition To be officially StormReady, a community or site must: * Establish a 24-hour warning point and emergency operations center; * Have redundant communications systems to receive severe weather forecasts and warnings and to alert the public. * Create a system that monitors local weather conditions; * Promote the importance of public readiness through community seminars; * Develop a formal hazardous weather plan, which includes training severe weather spotters and holding emergency exercises. At a minimum, NOAA Weather Radios (NWRs), with tone alert and particularly Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) capability, must be located at four sites within StormReady communities including emergency operations centers, 24-hour warning points, city hall, and all school superintendent offices. In addition to being in homes and offices, NOAA recommends that NOAA Weather Radios also be at the following locations: courthouses, libraries, schools, day care centers, movie theaters, hospitals, senior citizen homes, recreation facilities, sports arenas, public utilities, fairgrounds, and other sites where the general public may gather. Kearney County, Nebraska, displays a StormReady sign The National Weather Service (NWS) SKYWARN storm spotter program trains emergency managers, dispatchers, other first responders such as police officers and firefighters, and the general public on how to stay vigilant by identifying features in clouds that usually preclude the occurrence of severe weather. Trained SKYWARN storm spotters report hazardous weather conditions to their local NWS offices; amateur radio operators are also invited to participate. An advisory board, composed of NWS Warning Coordination Meteorologists and state and local emergency managers, reviews applications from municipalities and visits the locations to verify the steps made in the process to become StormReady. StormReady communities must stay freshly prepared, because the designation is only valid for three years. Funding The National Weather Service does not fund the program in forms other than review and recognition. One of its goals is to help local emergency managers justify costs and purchases related to supporting their hazardous weather-related programs. It does, however, issue a sign that communities may display. Success Van Wert Tornado A tornado struck and destroyed a movie theater in Van Wert County on November 10, 2002, about 28 minutes after a tornado warning was issued. Media coverage of the event emphasized that the theater was screening the film Santa Clause 2 - there were a number of children at the show. The first StormReady Community Hero Award was presented to Van Wert County Emergency Manager Rick McCoy, County Commissioner Gary Adams, and Van Wert City Mayor Stephen Gehres for establishing the county's StormReady program with the NWS. Van Wert Cinemas assistant manager Scott Shaffer was given the NWS Public Service Award for ushering moviegoers to safety after hearing the warning; he had attended a meeting sponsored by local emergency management agencies, and was able to direct the theater patrons to the safest areas within the building.

It first appeared as the third track on the 1973 album Selling England by the Pound, and was performed as a live piece either in whole or in part throughout the band's career.  Composition  Steve Hackett's guitar solo on \\"Firth of Fifth\\" has become a favourite among Genesis fans. The title is a pun on the estuary of the River Forth in Scotland, commonly known as the Firth of Forth. Though the song is credited to the entire band, most of the music was composed by keyboardist Tony Banks. He had written the bulk of the song by 1972, presenting it as a candidate for the album Foxtrot (1972), but it was rejected. He redesigned the piece, which the group accepted as a candidate for Selling England by the Pound. Banks, who worked on the lyrics with Mike Rutherford, later dismissed them, saying they were \\"one of the worst sets of lyrics [I have] been involved with.\\"Carman, Ryne (2016). \\"The Top 10 Genesis Songs From The Peter Gabriel And Phil Collins Eras\\", TheOdysseyOnline.com. The song starts out with a classical-style grand piano introduction played by Banks. This section is rhythmically complex, with certain bars in the rare time signatures of and , alternating with bars of . This section changes tempo and segues into the first section of lyrics, accompanied by Phil Collins on drums and a chord progression between the Hammond organ (Banks) and guitar (Steve Hackett). This leads into a flute melody played by Peter Gabriel, followed by a synth-driven instrumental section which restates the opening piano theme. Hackett then plays the flute melody using violin-like guitar tones. Peter Gabriel then sings a brief section of lyrics before Banks concludes the song on piano.  Live performances  Daryl Stuermer playing the guitar solo in \\"Firth of Fifth\\" live with Genesis in 2007 From autumn 1973 onwards, the song's piano intro was omitted during live performances. Banks felt he could not play the introduction effectively live, as he used an RMI electric piano on stage, which was not touch-sensitive. The song survived the departure of Peter Gabriel in 1975, with Phil Collins taking over to sing lead, but was dropped as a piece overall following Hackett's departure in 1977. It was reinstated for the 1981 tour, and performed for the Six of the Best reunion show in 1982. The instrumental section of the song, featuring the guitar solo, was resurrected for the Mama Tour in 1983-84, as well as the We Can't Dance tour in 1992, with touring member Daryl Stuermer playing Hackett's guitar parts. This section of the song featured on the Calling All Stations tour in 1998, with Anthony Drennan playing guitar. It was resurrected for the 2007's Turn It On Again: The Tour, again featuring Collins and Stuermer. The instrumental segues directly into \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" in 1992 and 2007 versions. Hackett has continued to play the song live since leaving Genesis. It appears on his solo album of re-worked Genesis songs, Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited (1996), with lead vocal by John Wetton, as well as on Hackett's live album The Tokyo Tapes (1998). The song was also included as an encore on his Genesis Revisited tour (2013-2014), featured on the live album Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith (2013).  Reception  The song has had a strong critical response as one of the best examples of progressive rock. Particular highlights of the track include Banks' piano introduction and Hackett's guitar solo. Rock author Edward Macan describes \\"Firth of Fifth\\" as \\"one of the finest nine and half minutes of music that Genesis ever put down\\". Genesis biographers Dave Bowler and Bryan Dray describe Hackett's solo as \\"the crowning moment of Hackett's time with the band.\\" Hackett has spoken favourably about his contributions to the song, saying \\"it'll always be twinned with me, and I still enjoy playing it. It's a great melody for guitar\\".

Considered a children's novel, it is mixture of war novel and a satire of bureaucracy, telling the story of a 10-year-old queen's quest to regain her throne. Summary All three books in this trilogy, Swan Lake, A City in Winter, and the final novel in the series, The Veil of Snows abound in winter season atmosphere and fairy tale magic. This imaginative novel continues the story of Swan Lake, in which an unnamed country girl hears from her beloved tutor the story of a prince and his beautiful lover Odette who are usurped from their kingdom by evil forces. By the book's end, the child has realized that she is the couple's daughter, and therefore, the rightful heir to the throne. As A City in Winter begins, the youthful heir to the frosty kingdom is an adult, restored to the throne as queen. The story is told in flashback to her unborn child; she recalls her return to the city at age ten, and tells how the restoration came about. The events center on the period when the heroine slipped into the enormous city of the usurper, and took a job as a yam curler in the palace. The unnamed girl's foe, the usurper, is also never given a proper name: \\"His face was scarred and twisted, his towering form draped in black robes that flew in his wake like the wings of a crow that dies in midair and cartwheels to the ground. He wore a mask that made him look like death itself.‚Äù The girl finds in the capital city a million loyalists and former soldiers, all united by an oath of rebellion, waiting for a leader whose prophetic return will be heralded by a dimmed sun and a burning angel. In her quest to remove the usurper, the main character befriends a number of these outwardly obedient, inwardly rebellious people, including the baker- slave Notorincus and his slave-of-a-slave, Astrahn, a former general of the Damavand and renowned tactician, who brave terrifying odds with humor and selflessness to protect the protagonist, while unaware that she is their queen. For example, Notorincus reveals his cry of battle to be ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never bake another waffle-torte for a single imperial soldier as long as I live!\\" While the young girl does eventually regain the palace, her victory does not come without sacrifice. Near the novel's end, the child's tutor arrives in the city to aid her; knowing that the citizens will not accept her as queen without the prophetic appearance of a burning angel the tutor douses himself with kerosene, lights a match, and as the people of the city watch, throws himself from an enormous tower to the city square below. ‚ÄúThey say that as he fell, he flew, tumbling and wheeling in the air in slow motion, his arms outspread with all his strength, the fire trailing like the tail of a comet.‚Äù It is not until this final act that the 10-year-old girl is able to open the doors of the palace to find the city bowing before her.

The play is essentially a long monologue delivered by a small-time hustler named Erie Smith to the hotel's new night clerk Charlie Hughes, lamenting how Smith's luck has gone bad since the death of Hughie, Hughes' predecessor. O'Neill wrote Hughie in 1942, although it did not receive its world premiere until 1958, when it was staged in Sweden at the Royal Dramatic Theatre with Bengt Eklund as Erie Smith. It was first staged in English at the Theatre Royal, Bath, in 1963 with Burgess Meredith as Erie. The play was first presented on Broadway in 1964 starring Jason Robards as Erie and directed by Jos√© Quintero. Robards received a Tony Award nomination for his performance, and revived the production in 1975 in Berkeley, California, with Jack Dodson as Charlie Hughes. Robards and Dodson returned to perform it at the Hyde Park Festival Theatre in 1981 and with the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1991, also televising their performances in 1984 for PBS. Hughie has been produced on Broadway three times since the 1964 Robards/Quintero production. In 1975 it was paired in repertory with David Scott Milton's play Duet, this time with Ben Gazzara as Erie (who also won a Tony Award nomination for the role), and in 1996 by the Circle in the Square Theatre in a production directed by and starring Al Pacino. The designers for that production were David Gallo (sets), Donald Holder (lights), Candice Donnelly (costumes) and John Gromada (sound). Goodman Theatre in Chicago put on the play in January and February 2010, with Brian Dennehy in the title role. The production was variously well-reviewed, with emphasis on Dennehy's strong performance. Later in 2010, Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, brought the show to its stage with Brian Dennehy as Erie once again. The play was revived in 2013 at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. with Richard Schiff as Erie. It returned for a fourth time to Broadway with Forest Whitaker as Erie Smith in February 2016. The 2016 revival was directed by Michael Grandage with Darren Bagert as a lead producer.Paulson, Michael, \\"Gambling on O'Neill: Forest Whitaker Makes His Broadway Debut in Hughie\\", The New York Times, February 3, 2016.

Arab citizens can enlist if they want to but are not required by law. Other exceptions are made on religious, physical, or psychological grounds. As of 2020, the normal length of compulsory service was two years and six months for men (with some roles requiring an additional four months of service), and two years for women (with some roles requiring an additional eight months of service). In 2013, 26% of potential conscripts were exempt from military service: 13.5% for religious reasons, 4% for mental health reasons, 2% for physical health reasons, 3% due to criminal records, and 3% due to residing abroad. The Israeli Defense Service Law (◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü) regulates these duties and exceptions. According to the Defense Service Law, the enlistment to the Israeli Defense Forces is mandatory for all Israeli citizens who have turned 18 (with the above-mentioned exemptions enshrined in the Defense Service Law). Military service obligation Officers in reserve duty before parachuting exercise. Reserve service may continue until the age of 51.Israel Defense Forces (IDF)‚ÄîAn IntroductionJewish Virtual Library In 1949, after the founding of the State of Israel, the Defense Service Law gave the IDF the authority to enlist any citizen. Draftees would then be required to show up for the draft in accordance with the military's decision to enlist them. Under this law, the period of service for men was 30 months and for women 18 months (although in accordance with a temporary order from January 10, 1968, six additional months were added to the mandatory service, 36 months for men and 24 months for women respectively.) The service for men has been reduced to 32 months since 2015, and to 30 months since 2020. The draft requirement applies to any citizen or permanent resident who has reached the age of 18, and in accordance with the law, the individuals who are exempt from the draft are dismissed for various reasons, such as incapability, medical problems, military personnel needs, etc. Many of the soldiers who complete their mandatory military service are later obligated to serve in a reserve unit in accordance with the military's needs. Economic constraints on the IDF have caused them to reconsider their structure and slowly shift towards a more modern military. A shift towards a professional militia has caused the IDF to adopt more career-oriented attributes, thus becoming more selective than in prior years. Instead of focusing on ‚Äúrole expansion,‚Äù Israel, most specifically its government, is focusing on ‚Äúnation building.‚Äù One of the most extraordinary recent developments is a focus on inclusivity of gay and especially disabled citizens. Medical profiles The IDF determines a medical profile for each soldier; according to that profile, the army decides where to assign the draftees. The highest medical profile draftees serve in the five infantry Brigades, Field/Combat Intelligence units, and Combat engineers. The second highest medical profiles are assigned to serve in the Armoured Corps, Artillery, Military Police, Border Police, and Aman. The lowest acceptable level of medical profiles are drafted into the combat support and combat service support Arms, such as the Adjutant Corps, Logistics Corps, and the Ordnance Corps. Draftees with lower than acceptable profiles (Profile 21) and draftees diagnosed as not suitable for military service are fully exempted from military obligations. The highest profile is 97. Exemption from service Although the conscription is officially compulsory, in practice a significant percentage of the population does not enlist for various reasons. Among other things, recent decades have seen a growing, but still very rare, phenomenon of draft dodging from military service, mainly due to conscience or political reasons (See Refusal to serve in the Israeli military). Exemptions have come under attack on grounds of fairness, and also because of a perceived shortage of combat personnel. Yeshiva students who declare that \\"Torah study is their artistry\\" (Torato Umanuto) (◊™◊ï◊®◊™◊ï ◊ê◊ï◊û◊†◊ï◊™◊ï) can delay their conscription as long as they continue their studies, under the so-called Tal Law. In practice, many of them end up never serving at all. This is a very controversial issue in Israel and key component of religious relations in Israel. Several attempts were made to change the practice, notably the establishment of the Tal committee in 1999, which led to the Tal Law, implemented in 2002. Yet the Torato Umanuto exemption continued largely unchanged. The Tal Law was later ruled unconstitutional in its current form, and a replacement is needed before August 2012. Most beneficiaries of this exemption are Haredi Jews. Members of the Religious Zionist sector often serve within a separate system called Hesder which combines advanced Talmudic studies with military service in the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF also tends to make the military service easier for recruits at an older age and recruits with families, as well as athletes and musicians of note. From time to time a public debate emerges in Israel around the issue of exemption from military service in Israel. A basic law of Israel is the Israeli Defense Service Law. It lists the guidelines and regulations of mandated military service in Israel. Some regulation includes age, duties, service requirements, time of service, etc. Chapter 5: Reserve Service: Going Abroad covers the rules and requirements for going on becoming a temporary reserve and going abroad. (a) A person designated for defense service and a person of military age who belongs to the regular forces of the Israel Defense Forces shall not go abroad unless granted a permit from the Minister of Defense. (b) A person of military age the continuance of whose regular service has been deferred for any reason shall not go abroad during the period of deferment save under a permit from the Minister of Defense. (c) A permit under this section may be unconditional or subject to conditions, including a condition relating to the holder's stay abroad. (e) Where any of the conditions of the permit is not fulfilled, the Minister of Defense may revoke the permit and may direct him, by order, to return to Israel within the time prescribed in the order. (f) The Minister of Defense shall not exercise his power under subsection (e) before he has given the holder of the permit an opportunity to state his case to him. The IDF had strict restraints on letting individuals go into the reserves, even if just temporarily because of their high risk of attack from neighboring states. Through the dissolution of partnerships and peace treaties in recent years, that threat has reduced considerably. Consequently, the high demand for IDF soldiers has slightly decreased as well. Policy regarding various specific population groups * The IDF does not conscript Arab citizens of Israel who are Muslim or Christian, however, increasing numbers choose to volunteer for military service. Many Bedouins enlist on a voluntary basis. For Druze and Circassian men, enlistment is mandatory. * Yeshiva students who declare that \\"Torah study is their profession\\" (Torato Umanuto) (◊™◊ï◊®◊™◊ï ◊ê◊ï◊û◊†◊ï◊™◊ï) could delay their conscription as long as they continue their studies, under the so-called Tal Law until it has been cancelled. * Female draftees who state that they maintain a religious Jewish way of life are exempt from military service, and many of them choose to volunteer for an alternative national service called Sherut Leumi. * Male members of the Religious Zionist sector often serve within a separate system called Hesder which combines advanced Talmudic studies with military service in the Israel Defense Forces. They normally serve for a year and five months instead of three years. * Draftees who state that they are pacifists are required to appear before a committee tasked with examining the credibility of their claim. Exemption from service is granted if the committee is persuaded that their pacifism is sincere and meets the agreed criteria. Only a few individuals each year are granted an exemption on grounds of pacifism; all other self-declared pacifists are required to enlist. * Immigrants who immigrate to Israel at the age of recruitment get various concessions in their military service. * Draftees with a physical disability which are exempt from military service may still volunteer to serve. It can be a symbolic service of four hours a day, but they might also end up serving in full-time military service. * Leading active athletes might in many cases be granted an \\"Outstanding athlete\\" status which allows them to get a more convenient and shorter service, so they can continue to develop their career and represent Israel abroad in international competitions. The \\"Outstanding athlete\\" status is given only to athletes competing in Olympic sports.http://www.mcs.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/ABB60909-76A9-498E-8FF1-54C4B3924B30/0/◊ß◊®◊ô◊ò◊®◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù◊ú◊°◊§◊ï◊®◊ò◊ê◊ô◊ù◊û◊¶◊ò◊ô◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù.doc In addition, the military also grants the similar \\"Outstanding dancer\\" status and an \\"Outstanding musician\\" status. This status is granted in the same way and after the individuals have been examined. They may also be granted a more convenient service so that they can continue to improve their abilities and career during military service. Draft process The military draft process occurs in the following steps: The Army calls upon a potential soldier in a letter and this is called the \\"First Calling\\" or Tzav Rishon. This letter states that the teenager must report to a certain place at a certain time for a day-long examination and interviewing. After careful looking over of the Tzav Rishon's results the army will call the people to enlist when they turn a certain age to begin the army process and basic training. Deferment There are various routes which allow the draftees to postpone the date of recruitment. An automatic postponement is granted for student to graduate from high school. Additional routes which lead to the postponing of the recruitment: * Volunteering for a one-year service in a youth organization. * Postponement of conscription due to the IDF needs, usually due to a course beginning in a date which occurs later than the original drafting date given to the draftee. * Postponement of conscription due to various personal reasons. * One can postpone the draft in a year in order to go to Torah studies. * One can postpone the draft as part of the Hesder agreement. Academic programs * Academic Reserve - a program designed to enlist and train soldiers which have an academic background in fields vital to the military's needs. * Talpiot program - an elite training program for young people who have demonstrated outstanding academic ability in the sciences, physics and mathematics. Graduates of the Talpiot program pursue higher education while serving in the army, and then utilize their expertise to further IDF research and development. * The pilot course also offers a Tal college degree. * The Israeli Naval Academy (◊ß◊ï◊®◊° ◊ó◊ï◊ë◊ú◊ô◊ù), whose candidates study for a degree from the Haifa University during the course. Incompatibility and adjustment difficulties During the drafting process sometimes draftees get exempted from the draft because of incompatibility. Sometimes the incompatibility of an individual is determined later on during his or her military service, and leads to dismissal from the army. The incompatibility may stem from various reasons: * Criminal record or history of using drugs. * Low motivation to serve. When there is a surplus of recruits, the military often raises the threshold required of recruits, and grants an exemption due to incompatibility to a much larger number of recruits. In addition, there is a widespread phenomenon of granting exemption from military service because of incompatibility to female candidates who were identified as having a low medical profile and/or low motivation to serve. In such cases the reason for the exemption would usually be stated as: \\"Excess of female recruits.\\" The IDF can also determine that a draftee has adjustment difficulties. A soldier with adjustment difficulties would not serve as a combat soldier. Volunteering A draftee found unfit for military service may still choose to volunteer for military service; his status will be similar to all the other draftees found to be fit for service. Once enlisted, these volunteers cannot choose to quit the military early.  Civilian national service  There is an alternative voluntary civilian national service in Israel for those that cannot or do not wish to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Future The IDF has reportedly concluded that it will, at some point in the future, have to end conscription in favor of an all-volunteer force. Reasons include growing unpopularity of military service among Israeli youth, a growth in draft-dodging, and budgetary constraints that would prevent the IDF from conscripting all those eligible even if draft-dodging were not an issue. Israel is reportedly studying how the United States and European nations ended conscription and transitioned to all-volunteer forces, for a possible future transition.

Etymology  Some sources, including A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published by Samuel Lewis in 1837, note that the area was sometimes \\"known as \\"the kingdom of Glan,\\" but more properly called Glangalvin, or the country of the Mac Gaurans\\". The modern interpretation of Glangevlin (sometimes Glangalvin) is \\"Glen with the Fork\\", but traditionally the name is said to derive from the mythical cow which belonged to Gaibhnen, the blacksmith of the Tuatha D√© Danann. The Book of Magauran, written c.1340, spells it as but it has also been spelled , as in this scribal note to the Poems on the O'Reillys: > \\"I am in Gleann Gaibhneann, now called Gleann Gaibhle, to-day, the vigil of > the feast of John the Baptist, 1599.\\" The Gap of Glan was supposedly created by the cow when it ran away from the blacksmith's forge. In the townland of Derrynatuan in Glan is shown the site of Gaibhlean's forge today. MacKillop's Celtic Dictionary gives: > \\"Glas Ghaibhleann, Gaibhleann, Ghaibhnann, Ghaibhnenn, Ghoibhneann, Gavelen, > Gaivlen, Glasgavelen [Ir. glas, green, greenish blue; of Gaibl√≠n (?), of > Goibniu (?)]. Celebrated, magical cow, white with green spots, whose > inexhaustible supply of milk signalled prosperity. The original owner is a > matter of some dispute, possibly Goibniu the smith or Gaibl√≠n, a farmer of > Co. Cavan or Balor the Formorian of Tory Island\\".  History  :See also: Gub (Glangevlin) and Tullytiernan for more history of the village =Prehistoric= This region was reputedly inhabited as far back as 5000 years ago, when tribes such as the Tuatha D√© Danann, the Fomorians, the Milesians and the Celts found their way up the rivers Erne and Shannon. The evidence for this settlement can be seen in the form of the dolmens, ringed forts, caiseals, passage graves and lake dwellings associated with the area. These numerous caves and underground passages provided a shelter for these early settlers. The Ringed Forts were built as a defense against the wolves and eagles during the Bronze Age and were even used up to the 12th Century and later. They were built of clay, stone and bushes. =Medieval= The earliest surviving reference to Glangevlin is a poem called Acallam na Sen√≥rach composed c. 1180. In the poem Ca√≠lte mac R√≥n√°in meets Saint Patrick and relates tales to him about the Fianna. In one of these tales Fionn mac Cumhaill is captured by the High King of Ireland, Cormac mac Airt. In order to release Fionn, Ca√≠lte must bring two of every wild animal in Ireland to Cormac. One stanza states- Dh√° ch√°ochan a Ghleann Gaibhle, (Two chough birds from Glangevlin). The tale is also found in Book of the Dean of Lismore. A variant of the tale is in the Great Book of Lecan. The Book of Magauran also contains several early mentions of Glangevlin. Poem VI, stanza 2, composed c. 1290 by Giolla P√°draig Mac Naimhin, states- Ad chondairc me aislingi tiar ar bord Glinni Gaibhli iarrfoidhmid na haichinti go findum in bha taibsi dar Dia smaith mo tairisi bam breth uaithibh i nairdi. (I had some visions in the West beside Gleann Gaibhle; I will consult knowledgeable folk to find whether they were merely a vain dream; great is my hope, I swear, of being mounted on a horse by them). Poem V, stanza 5, composed c. 1323 by L√∫cas Mac Naimhin, states- Ro bo minci crodh na ceall ar comairci a craibh Railenn tainte sluaigh Glindi Gaibli tre buaibh cilli ar comairghi. (Most often was the kine of churches spared by the Hero of Raoileann; the flocks of the host of Gleann Gaibhle are safe owing to those churches' kine being spared). Stanza 31 in the same poem states- Tug Gleand nGaibli gan ghabhail marbhadh meic Meg Amradain fagus tra in gabhal don glinn in ladhar ge ta ar toitim (That Gleann Gaibhle is untaken is caused by the death of McGovern's son; the fork lies near the glen, though its prongs are broken). Poem XXIII, stanza 27, composed c. 1339 by Aonghus √ì hEoghusa, states- Ni gael crechi cimsa a tiri Teallach nEachthach anba an toir beth ag on fhir im Gleand nGaibhli fidh ma ceand ni daingni doibh (Tullyhaw's borders know little of being raided- it would be too dangerous!; while this hero guards Gleann Gaibhle- its folk were no safer had they a wood around them). Stanza 30 in the same poem states- Suighfea chugud coigeadh nGeanaind a Glind Gaibhli in greadha luaith ni cuma chael is fearr uirru do thaebh a heang tuilli in tuaith (O Gleann Gaibhle of the swift steeds, thou shalt absorb into thyself the Province of Geanann; thou shouldst have the land beside her angles, for her narrow confines suit her not). Poem XXV, stanza 30, composed c. 1339 by Niall √ì hUiginn states- O Inis Taidhg go Traigh clainInnsi a craibh Oidbhi les Loch mac nEn ri Gleann nGaibli agus Beann Boinri (From Inis Taidhg to the shore of Claoininis belongs to the Hero of Oidhbhe; to him belong Loch Mac n-√âan, Gleann Gaibhle and Beann Boinre). Poem XXXI, stanza 17, composed c. 1344 by Maol Seachluinn √ì hEoghasa states- Ni frith orraim dhfhir uaindi a glind Ghaibhli gheguaini re ndhul dha gribh Cunga o chach da righ nirbh urra a oglach (No other man ever got homage from us in green-valleyed Gleann Gaibhle till Cunga's Griffin died, and no common soldier ever dared to act as lord to a lord). Poem XXXII, stanza 32, composed c. 1344 by Mathghamhain √ì hUiginn states- Borb re comhursain cleath Mh√°lann, m√≠n re h√©igsibh a ucht geal, n-a fhaire fa ghlais Ghlinn nGaibhle craidhe fairsing baidhbhe Breagh (M√°lann's Pillar is rough to neighbours, his bright breast welcomes poets; the big heart of the Raven of Breagha watches over green Gleann Gaibhle). In 1390 the McKiernan Clan of Tullyhunco, County Cavan and their allies the Clan Muircheartaigh U√≠ Conchobhair entered into a conflict with the O‚ÄôRourke clan whose chief, Tigern√°n M√≥r O‚ÄôRourke, was in Glangevlin at the time. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1390 state- A great war between O'Ruairc and O'Raighilligh; and the people of Anghaile, and Muinter-Eolais, the Tellach-Dunchadha, and the Clann-Muirchertaigh come to join in that war, under the direction of Domhnall, the son of Muirchertach, and of Tomaltach Mac Donnchaidh. The Clann-Muirchertaigh and Tellach-Dunchadha emigrated in despite of Muinter-Ruairc, towards Fidh-na-finnoige, Sliabh-Corran, and Cenel- Luachain; and O'Ruairc obtained intelligence of this whilst he was in Glenn- Gaibhle; and he brought his bands to the upper part of Cenel-Luachain; and a brave, destructive assault was made by O'Ruairc on these royal divisions, who were routed; and the killing of their flocks continued from Bel-atha-doire- Dubhthaigh to the summit of the Breifnian hills. The Annals of Connacht for 1390 state- A great war between O Ruairc and O Raigillig. The Muinter Angaile, Muinter Eolais, Tellach Dunchada and Clann Muirchertaig, instructed by Domnall son of Muirchertach [O Conchobair] and Tomaltach Mac Donnchada, entered Connacht. The Clan Murtagh and Tellach Dunchada made a forcible migration into the country of the Muinter Ruairc towards Fid O Finnoice, Sliab Corrain and Cenel Luachain. O Ruairc got word of this in Glengavlin. He conveyed his trains to the upper end of Cenel Luachain and made a fierce and victorious attack on those allied princes and routed them, and kept on slaughtering their cattle from Bel Atha Daire Dubthaig to the top of the Brefne hills. The Annals of Ulster for 1390 state- Great war this year between Tigernan Ruairc, namely, king of Breifni and Thomas, son of Mathgamain Ua Raighillaigh, namely, king of Muinter-Mailmordha. And Maghnus Ua Ruairc was at that time in custody with Ua Raghallaigh in the Rock of Loch-Uachtair. The Rock was pierced through and he escaped thereout and went to the castle of Loch-in-scuir and the clan of Muircertaigh Ua Concobuir followed him and he was killed by them in leaving the Loch. Ua Ruairc pursued the clan of Muircertach into Tellach-Dunchadha and they and the Tellach-Dunchadha were defeated, had the prey wrested from them and were pursued from the Ford of Daire-Dubain to Sliabh-Cairbri. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1390 state- A great war broke out between O'Rourke and O'Reilly; and the people of Annaly the O'Farrells, the Muintir-Eolais the Mac Rannalls; and the Clann-Murtough O'Conor, at the instigation of Donnell, the son of Murtough, and Tomaltagh Mac Donough, came to join in that war. Manus O'Rourke, who had been imprisoned by O'Reilly in the castle of Lough Oughter, made his escape from it, and went to the castle of Lough-an Scuir; but the Clann-Murtough, being informed of this by his betrayers, they slew him as he was coming ashore out of a cot. A peace was concluded between O'Rourke and O'Reilly; and O'Reilly received great rewards for banishing and expelling from him the enemies of O'Rourke. Owen O'Rourke and the son of Cathal Reagh were delivered up as hostages for the payment of these considerations.The Clann- Murtough and Teallach Dunchadha emigrated, in despite of the O'Rourkes, into Fidh-ua-Finnoige, Slieve-Corrain, and Kinel-Luachain. But as soon as O'Rourke, who was at that time in Glenn-Gaibhle, received notice of this, he took his scouts with him to the upper part of Kinel-Luachain, where he made an attack on them, and forced them to fly before him, killing both cattle and people on their route from Beal-atha Doire-Dubhain to the summit of the Breifnian hills. The Annals of Clonmacnoise for 1390 state- There was great dissentions between o'Roirck, o'Relly & the o'fferalls, the MaGranells; Tomaltagh m'Donnogh and the sonnes of Alurtagh came to Conaught upon heareing of the said warres, by the procurement of Donell mcMurtagh and Donell mcDonogh. Magnus o'Roirck remayned prisoner with o'Relly in the Island of Loghoghter, from whence he went to the castle of Loghskwyre, where being betrayed to the sonns of Murtagh, they killed him as hee was leaving the Coytt. o'Roirck and o'Reilye came to certaine articles of agreement, and at last peace was firmly concluded between them, but before this peace was thoroughly concluded o'Roirck gave great guifts to o'Relly for consenting to theese agreements and for banishing his enemies from out of his territoryes; for performance of these articles Owen o'Roirck m'Cahall Reagh was given as a faithfull pledge. The sons of Murtagh and Teallagh Donogh with theire forces made an Inrode upon o'Roirck at a place called ffie fBnoigh; and the Mount called Sliew Corrann and Keann- Kwachar. O'Roirck hearing thereof being at ffye Gaiule, brought his preyes and people with him to a place called Barre and from thence he assaulted the said parties his adversaries, ouerthrew them, killed many of their people and Cattle, and held on his course of killing them from Belagh Derg to the top of the place called Tullagh Brefnagh; A manuscript entitled Poems on the O'Reillys, contains a note by one of the poets written on 24 June 1599- Is truagh liom nach deuntar ennd√°n don macaomh, d√° ndearnadh in d√°n sin, ar bhf√°ghail b√°is a ngeimhlibh Gall a mBaile √Åtha Cliath dh√≥ 1598 agus mo bheannacht fein re a anmuin. A nGleann Gaibhneand d√° ngoirtear Gleann Gaibhle anois at√∫ aniodh l√° fh√©l' Eoin Baist√≠ 1599. Agus is isin aimsir so t√°ngadur dh√° luing reamhra √≥ r√≠gh na Sp√°inne l√°n d'arm√°il do chungnamh cogaidh go Gaoidhealuibh Ereand a n-aghaidh Shacsanach (I deem it a pity that no poem is made to the youth, to whom that poem was made, after his death in the fetters of the foreigners in Dublin, 1598, and my blessing be with his soul. I am today in Gleann Gaibhneand, which is now called Gleann Gaibhle, on the feast of John the Baptist, 1599. And it is in this time that two large ships came from the King of Spain to the Irish of Ireland to help in the war against the English). A poem composed about 1602, stanza 19, by Brian √ì Corcr√°n tells how the chief of the Maguires of Fermanagh, C√∫chonnacht Maguidhir, hunted deer in Glangevlin- I nGleann Gaibhle druim ar druim tug so is ag Sliabh an Iarainn fros m√≠lealbha muin ar muin is pr√≠mhealmha os n-allaidh. A poem about the River Shannon, composed at the beginning of the 17th century by Tadg √ìg √ì hUiginn (b. 1582) states in stanza 3- D√∫thcha dhuit bheith againne, d√° bhf√©achtha dona f√°thaibh: Gleann Gaibhle as √© t'athairsi, an Bhr√©ifne as √≠ do mh√°thair (By nature thou art ours, if sound reasons be regarded: Glen Gavlin is thy father, Brefney is thy mother). =After 1600= In the 1609 Plantation of Ulster, Glangevlin formed part of lands which were granted to John Sandford of Castle Doe, Co. Donegal (the father-in-law of Thomas Guyllym of Ballyconnell) by letters patent dated 7 July 1613 (Pat. 11 James I ‚Äì LXXI ‚Äì 38, Glangewley). It was later sold by Sandford to his wife's uncle Toby Caulfeild, 1st Baron Caulfeild, Master of the Ordnance and Caulfield had the sale confirmed by letters patent of 12 July 1620 (Pat. 19 James I. XI. 45 ‚Äò'Glangewly'‚Äô). The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as Glangewly. In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247‚Äì263 there were eleven Hearth Tax payers in Glangowlyn, namely Tirlagh O Davin, Tirlagh O Dogan, Daniell McGawran, Gillebreedy McKelagher, Patricke McGwire, Phelemy Oge O Dolan, Patricke Groma O Dolan, Ternan McGawran, Teige Magawran, Patricke Magawran and Mahon O Dolan. In early 1708 the famous harpist Turlough O'Carolan was travelling to Mayo from Fermanagh when he was caught in a snowstorm in Glangevlin. He and his guide were forced to take shelter in a miserable cabin where he spent a few days waiting for the snow to clear. Whilst on the muddy mountainside with nothing but water to drink he composed the famous air- Lament for Sir Ulick Bourke. Another of O'Carolan's compositions was The O'Rourkes' Feast, which was based on a poem called Pl√©araca na Ruarcach composed by a native of Glangevlin, Hugh McGovern (Aodh Macgowran) c.1712. By 1717 Morley Saunders, was the owner of Glangevlin. By deed dated 25 February 1717 the aforesaid Morley Saunders leased the townland of Glanevelin to John Enery of Bawnboy and Richard Hassard. The Roman Catholic parish of Glangevlin formed part of Templeport parish until 1750 when it was hived off into a separate parish. A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of Glangevlin and surrounding townlands. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Glandowly. John O'Donovan visited Glan on Monday 16 May 1836 for the purpose of the Ordnance Survey then taking place. He states:‚Äì > \\"After having procured a kind of a dinner at the head Inn of Swanlinbar, > wishing to lose no time in that uninteresting village we directed our course > southwestwards for about three miles through the Parish of Kil Naile, and > then turned northwestwards to make our way into the centre of the wild > valley of Glen Gavlen, a distance of 8 long Irish miles. This is the worst > road and perhaps the wildest district I ever saw. Situated between the two > lofty and barren Mountains of Cailceach and Sliabhan-Iarainn, this valley > will never induce mankind to run a railroad through it; its sides are > precipitous and rocky, defying the exertions of the plough and the wheeled > car, and even of the side car! The loy (a peculiar long spade) only can be > used to form the nidus for the potato and grain. The snow lies brooding on > the mountains on either side till late in Spring (which prevents early > tillage) and when dissolving before the south wind warmed by the sun of > spring it (i.e. the snow turned into water) overfloods and injures the > sloping fields, the Mistks and Meenies of this Valley of Gavlen. Its road > (if road it might be called) is precipitous and stony, and intersected by > many deep and rough glens with their mountain streams (now nearly dried up) > which makes it very difficult to run a rail road from the City of Bawnboy to > that of the Black Lion. Perhaps the future industry of the men of Hy Briuin > Breifny may open this important communication after they shall have again > set up Magauran as the Lord of the Tribe of Eochy (Tullyhaw)! We lodged in a > farmer's house in Glen Gavlen for two days; on Tuesday we directed our > course northwards through the parish of Templeport, over a very bad, rough, > rocky road and indulged our curiosity by visiting the large spring well in > the Townland of Derrylahan in which the Shannon (according to tradition) had > its source. It is a round deep pool throwing out a stream of considerable > size which the country people call the Shannon. The pool itself is called by > some Poll Lagan Sionna, and Lag Bhun na Sionna by others. From this pool we > directed our course through the Parish of Killoynagh to hear the names of > the townlands in it prounouned in Irish by the natives. They speak the Irish > very well but retain no traditions connected with the old Church except that > it was built by St.Bridget and St. Leyny, from the latter of whom it and its > Parish have received its name. There are two wells dedicated to them which > are set down in the name Books and which will consequently appear on the > Map. Of St. Leyny nothing is now remembered but that he was a Leinsterman > who, falling in love with St. Bridget, followed her hither, but who, when > St. Bridget plucked out her eyes to destroy her beauty, repented, became a > Saint and built this Church by which he transmitted his memory to posterity > with more success than he would have by marrying the beautiful-eyed Bridget. > When St. Leynie declared that he was in love with St. Bridget she asked with > what part of her he was in love. He answered, with her eyes, upon hearing > which she plucked out her eyes saying, here they are for you ‚Äì a wonderful > thing for one to do, who was herself a bastard. After getting the names of > the Parish of Kil-Loynie we returned from the Black Lion and Lough Macnean > to our host in Glenn Gaibhlean, and the next morning we remeasured our > journey along the craggy and precipitous road between the mountains, the > only pass out of this dreary district and proceeded southwards through the > Parish of Templeport with a view of seeing Father Philip Magauran, a lineal > descendant of the last chief of the tribe of Eochy (Tullyhaw) but he was not > at home.\\" The area is described by Lewis (1837) as a mountainous district between the counties of Fermanagh and Leitrim, generally known as the country of the MacGaurans. Around 1837 there was no public road, only one difficult pass; the Gap of Beal. At that time the area was approximately 16 miles in length by 7 in breadth, and was densely inhabited by a 'primitive race' known as Mac Gaurans and Dolans, who (it was reported) intermarried and observed some peculiar customs; electing their own king and queen from the ancient race of the Mac Gaurans, to whom they paid implicit obedience. It was also stated by Samuel Lewis that their sole occupation was tilling the land and attending the cattle; potatoes and milk, sometimes with oaten bread, being their chief food; and that the want of a road by which the produce of the district might be taken to the neighbouring markets operates as a discouragement to industry and an incentive to the illicit application of their surplus corn. In the 19th century, evictions were common in Glan. The 1938 D√∫chas Collection contains much folklore from Glangevlin.

It premiered on April 12, 2007 at the Vietnamese International Film Festival in Irvine, California. It was released on April 27, 2007 in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and played as the Closing Night film at the 2007 VC FilmFest in Los Angeles. Plot The movie is set in French-occupied Vietnam in 1922, where peasant rebellions against the French colonialists have erupted throughout the country. In response, the French have created units of Vietnamese secret agents to track down and eliminate the rebels. One of the agents is Le Van Cuong. Although he has a perfect track record, his conscience is troubled by the bloodshed he has caused. Following the assassination of a high-ranking French official, Cuong is assigned to seek and kill the notorious leader of the resistance. Cuong encounters Vo Thanh Thuy, a relentless revolutionary fighter and the daughter of the rebel leader. She is captured and imprisoned by Cuong's cruel superior, Sy. Cuong suspects that Sy learned about the attack on the French official beforehand and could have prevented it. Suspicious, he warns Thuy that her organization has a mole and helps her escape the prison, thus becoming a fugitive himself. Her fiery patriotism inspires Cuong, and he develops feelings for the young woman as well. Meanwhile, Sy follows Cuong and Thuy, knowing the pair will lead him to Thuy's father. Cuong changes his clothes and accompanies Thuy to her father. French soldiers attack them one night, but they managed to defeat them all. Thuy and Cuong then encounter Sy and Hua Danh. Though Sy couldn't find them, Cuong has to fight Hua Danh and manages to kill him, but not before being wounded. Later, while tending Cuong's wounds, Thuy reveals that her mother killed herself after being raped by a French soldier and couldn't bear having a child. Her father didn't learn of her mother's death until after he was freed from his imprisonment for opposition activities. Cuong and Thuy then make love. Meanwhile, Sy finds Cuong's father and tortures him before gouging his eyeball. He then faces Cuong and asks him where the rebel's hideout is. Cuong says that they have to go on a train, and Sy leaves. Cuong meets with Thuy, and she reveals that she lied about the train because she didn't trust him. She then takes him to her father's hideout. Thuy's brother is suspicious of Cuong, while her father accepts him regardless. Suddenly, the hideout is ambushed because the French saw Cuong and Thuy together. Sy captures Thuy's father and reveals Cuong as a traitor to the French. When Sy delivers Thuy's father to his boss, his boss instead gives Sy another boss, not trusting a Vietnamese person to be in charge. Furious, Sy kills both of his bosses and plans to execute Thuy's father. Meanwhile, the rebels are held at gunpoint in a village, awaiting execution. Cuong asks the firing squad to take off his blindfold because he doesn't fear death. Using a hidden knife, he cuts his bindings and frees all the rebels. Cuong and Thuy fight off the soldiers, and Thuy's brother tells her to go save her father before dying. Thuy and Cuong fight off the French people near a train, and Cuong finally confronts Sy. Cuong and Thuy finally manage to kill Sy by stabbing him in the eye. After they save Thuy's father, they return to the village where they found most of the people dead, except for a little girl. After paying their homage, Cuong and Thuy spread the ashes across the rivers of Vietnam.

Production \\"The Rebel's\\" cast and crew shot for 80 days in Vietnam, where the local film industry is still developing. They had to deal with a number of obstacles, including crew members who got sick, actors who were injured, and cultural officers who monitored the production's every move. In an interview with Johnny Tri Nguyen, he states that one of the hardest problems in making the film was finding the right actress to play the female lead. Parts of the film, mainly street scenes in the first half of the film, were shot in the old port town of H·ªôi An (standing in for Hanoi). Reception From left, director Charlie Nguyen, producer Jimmy Pham Nghiem and actors Dustin Nguyen, Johnny Tri Nguyen, Ngo Thanh Van, at a press conference during the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival, where the film was screened twice. The film premiered in Vietnam in April 2007, where it proved to be a huge success, garnering the highest box office gross for a locally made film up to that point. At the time, it was the most expensive Vietnamese film with a budget of $1.5 million. The Rebel was released in the United States as a two-disc DVD set on September 30, 2008 (from Dragon Dynasty). In the special features, Johnny Nguyen, Dustin Nguyen, and Ngo Thanh Van not only provide audio commentary, but also dubbed their own characters for the film's English language track. It was also featured at the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, the Hawaii International Film Festival, and was the Opening Night screening at the 2007 Mammoth Film Festival.The Rebel film page at Mammoth Film Festival.

From 1913 until 1967, the Georgian Bay Line (GBL) provided transit service and cruise voyages to passengers on North America's Great Lakes. History =Formation= The company was founded by Robert Chenault Davis, who for many years was employed by the Goodrich Line in Chicago. Mr. Davis envisioned a fleet of ships dedicated exclusively to passengers rather than the passenger and freight ships that plied the Great Lakes. The initial board consisted of Mr. Davis and four other Chicagoans: Charles Bour of President Northern Railways Advertising Company; Joseph M. Wile of Wile, Loeb & Gutman, Insurance; Dr. James Whitney Hall of the Chicago Railways Company; and Sam G. Goss, Vice President of Goss Printing Press Company. The company was capitalized initially with $250,000 in preferred stock from about 35 investors located mostly in Chicago and Detroit. =Profitable operations= The Georgian Bay Line began operation in 1913 with the SS North American, which was launched on January 16, 1913. Due to a very profitable first season, the company launched the SS South American on February 21, 1914. Built of steel, these ships were almost sister ships. The North American had an overall length of 280 feet (85 m) while the South American was 321 feet. They carried passengers between Chicago, Mackinac Island, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, Duluth, Georgian Bay, Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo, and sometimes intermediate ports. In the 1940s, the Georgian Bay Line acquired a third vessel, SS Alabama, a refugee from the bankrupt Goodrich Transit Company where Mr. Davis had begun his career. The three ships tied up at the foot of 16th Street in Holland, Michigan, each winter and until they were permanently assigned elsewhere. Up until World War II vessels like those operated by the Georgian Bay Line were an essential part of the transportation infrastructure of the Great Lakes. The line sold large quantities of point-to- point tickets to revenue passengers who paid publicly tariffed rates to be moved from one port to another. After the war, with increasingly inexpensive motor fuel and reliable, paved roads, point-to-point passenger volume declined and the Georgian Bay Line shifted its emphasis to the cruise ship trade. Both vessels advertised weeklong cruises through the upper Great Lakes, with the South American traditionally visiting Lake Superior and the North American taking the Lake Michigan run. Mackinac Island, in the Straits of Mackinac, was the division point where the Y-shaped arms of the Georgian Bay Line's service territory came together. =Shutdown= The Georgian Bay Line's long-term viability was compromised by the seasonal nature of Great Lakes cruise trade. The boats were traditionally fitted out each spring in May and mothballed each fall in late September. After the invention of the passenger jet airplane in the 1950s, North American tourists found themselves able to fly to ports in locations, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, where twelve-month cruising was possible. In addition, cruise ships operating in international waters could hire crews from the Third World and did not have to obey U.S. or Canadian labor laws. The Georgian Bay Line lost money in the 1960s. In 1963, after the GBL retired the North American, the South American and the Greene Line's Delta Queen were the last two long-distance cruise ships sailing under the U.S. flag. Neither vessel could meet modern fire-safety standards. In 1966, citing the danger to passengers of a catastrophic fire, Congress passed a law ordering both passenger vessels to tie up to the docks permanently. A series of temporary exceptions were carved out for the Delta Queen, but not for the South American. In 1967, the final Georgian Bay Line boat made its last trip. The North American sank while under tow to what would have been a new life as part of a merchant marine academy, and the South American was scrapped in 1992. The Alabama was cut down to a barge in 1961 and was still afloat until 2005, when she was scrapped. References Mary A.

Walker (August 3, 1935 - December 7, 2015) was an American writer. He was born in Decatur, Illinois, but spent most of his life in El Paso, Texas. The author of twenty-three books, he also served as a television reporter, editor, news and information officer, university press director, freelance writer, biographer, and historian. He was past president of Western Writers of America (WWA). Biography As a boy growing up in the farm town of Decatur, Illinois, Walker was inspired by the writings of Jack London, and has written extensively about the author. Walker began his writing career by working for his high school newspaper, and found various journalistic jobs throughout his youth. He enlisted in the navy at 18 and upon discharge visited his father, a career army sergeant, at Fort Bliss, Texas, and subsequently enrolled at the University of Texas at El Paso where he earned his degree in journalism within three years. By then he had married Alice McCord, fathered the first of five children, and earned a number of freelance publishing credits. Writing career Walker's freelance writing career began in earnest in 1960 while a college student working part-time at a television reporting job in El Paso. He wrote frequently for newspapers and magazines. His work, close to 2,000 published pieces appeared in 130 periodicals. His first big break came in 1967 when his mentor, the late Richard O'Connor, invited him to collaborate on a biography of radical journalist John Reed. Harcourt, Brace and World published the work as The Lost Revolutionary, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Walker waited 36 years for his second New York Times review, this one for his gold rush book, Eldorado, in 2003. Walker wrote pre-Civil War history as well as western and military history. His book, Mary Edwards Walker: Above and Beyond (2005) is a biography of the Civil War, his The Boys of '98: Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders (1998) received high praise as had his Bear Flag Rising: The Conquest of California (1999), which told of events that led to the annexation of California in 1846 when the territory was a Mexican province, and Pacific Destiny: The Three-Century Journey to the Oregon Country (2000), which won a Spur Award from Western Writers of America, as had three additional Walker works. His best writings were biographies such as Januarius MacGahan The Life and Campaigns of an American War Correspondent (1988), which he regarded as his best book.

He was born in Preston (Cambridge), Upper Canada, the son of Otto Klotz and Elise (Elizabeth) Wilhelm, Klotz was educated at Galt Grammar School, and later headed to University of Toronto, and finished his degree in 1872 in Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At 14 years of age, Klotz received a foolscap diary in which he recorded every day of life, except for two days when he crossed the date line. The personal and professional records are entered into the National Archives of Canada. In 1885, Klotz was the first person to be officially designated as astronomer in the Dominion of Canada. He had been assigned chief of astronomical observations to be conducted in British Columbia and the North West. He worked on the British Columbia Railway Belt Survey from 1885 to 1890, and was assigned the task to resolve the United States and Canada boundary dispute during the 1890s. Klotz also worked on the Alaska boundary survey in 1893-1894. While in London, England in 1898, he discovered an important cache of Foreign Office correspondence, much of which pertained to the North American Boundary Commission, some of whose Royal Engineer members were photographers. Klotz was appointed one (1908 as Assistant Chief Astronomer) of two employees of the Dominion Observatory, the nation's first astronomical observatory. In 1916 he was appointed Dominion Astronomer. His other claims to fame include the oversight of the All Red Cable Route connecting Australia and Canada in 1902, and he has been called the father of the Public Library in Ottawa University Club. He was also a member of the Astronomical Association of Mexico and of New Zealand Institute.

The school closed in July 2016 to facilitate the merger of Glan Afan itself, Sandfields Comprehensive, Cwrt Sart Comprehensive School, and Traethmelyn Primary School into the ultra-modern ¬£40millon 'super' school, Ysgol Bae Baglan. History Glan Afan was originally the County Grammar School, also known as Port Talbot County Boys' School. It then became Glan Afan comprehensive school in the early 1960s, taking pupils up to the age of 18. At that time the school's name was written as \\"Glanafan\\" rather than \\"Glan Afan\\". The sixth form was moved to Afan College after 1986. From 1974-96, it was administered by West Glamorgan County Council. In 1996, the Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council was formed, and the school is currently administered by Neath Port Talbot's LEA. In 2011, Neath Port Talbot LEA announced that Glan Afan School and three other schools will be closed to facilitate a new 'Super' Comprehensive and Primary School.

Phoenix is featured as the protagonist in the first three games of the series, appears as a supporting character in the fourth and returns as one of the protagonists for the fifth and sixth games. The character has also appeared in film, anime and manga adaptations of the series, a Japanese series of musicals and stage plays, and crossover video games such as Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Project X Zone 2, Puzzle Fighter, and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Conception and creation The idea of a lawyer was conceived when director Shu Takumi was searching for ideas for a game in which the player could discover lies or contradictions in statements. Wright's Japanese given name, Ry≈´ichi, alludes to the mythical dragon with its use of . His Japanese surname, Naruhod≈ç, references the Japanese expression , which equates to the English \\"I see\\". This phrase is often used in Japan to express attentiveness to the subject at hand. Takumi chose the phrase to highlight Wright's inexperience; even though his name reads \\"I see\\", he may not in fact understand what is happening, something which may also be true of people using the phrase. It is also commonly used in mystery novels when investigating, a core gameplay concept of the series. In English versions, Wright's name was localized to present a similar meaning to English-speaking audiences. His first name is also a mythical reference: to the phoenix, known for \\"rising from the ashes\\", an allusion to his almost impossible comebacks, or \\"turnabouts\\", during trials. This is referenced in the first game, in which the fifth case is titled \\"Rise from the Ashes\\". His surname is a pun, allowing for wordplay (such as \\"Right, Wright?\\" and \\"Phoenix Wrong\\"). Early brainstorming suggestions for Phoenix's name included \\"Cole\\" and \\"Wilton\\", but \\"Phoenix\\" was chosen as a name that would \\"stand out\\". The nickname \\"Nick\\" (used by his partner, Maya Fey) was chosen based on its believability and similarity to the sound of \\"Phoenix\\". Characteristics and backstory At the time of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Phoenix is a rookie defense attorney who usually accepts murder cases, attempting to exonerate his clients when there is seemingly incontrovertible evidence and testimony against them. Described as \\"goofy and single-minded\\", he often encounters unusual situations. Rather than simply arguing his case, Phoenix uses detective skills to gather relevant evidence and investigate the crime scene. When he was in grade school, he was accused of stealing Miles Edgeworth's lunch money, and since he was in a small school, there was a class trial. During the trial, Edgeworth and Larry Butz stood up for Wright, saying the teacher and students had no evidence of Wright's guilt. The class trial was dismissed and the three students became best friends until Edgeworth moved away following his father's murder. Fifteen years later, Larry would reveal that he was the one who stole Edgeworth's money that day, paying it back in full. While Wright is surprised, Edgeworth gives the appearance that he knew Larry stole his money all along. While a college student at Ivy University, Phoenix is accused of murder and successfully defended by a defense attorney named Mia Fey. After passing the bar exam, Phoenix becomes a defense attorney himself under Mia's law firm, Fey & Co. Following Mia's murder, Phoenix takes over the law firm, naming it Wright and Co., and also takes Mia's little sister, a spirit medium named Maya, under his wing. Maya becomes Phoenix's assistant and legal aide, assisting him by setting him up with clients, and by searching for information and clues during cases. As the years pass, Phoenix takes on several cases to prove the innocence of those wrongly accused of murder, developing a name and reputation for himself. He also helps out Maya with the well-being of her younger cousin, Pearl, after her mother's arrest. However, in one case, he inadvertently presents forged evidence to the court, not knowing it was forged until it was too late, and is forced to turn in his attorney's badge. Adopting a young girl named Trucy Enigmar as his daughter, Phoenix sets up the Wright Talent Agency, turning to playing piano and poker games for a source of income. Seven years later, Phoenix is accused of murdering a man named Shadi Smith, who has no known past and is simply a wanderer. Phoenix hires a rookie defense attorney named Apollo Justice, who works for Phoenix's friend, Kristoph Gavin, a renowned defense attorney. During the trial, Apollo and Phoenix reveal that Phoenix had been set up, and Kristoph was the real murderer. After he successfully defends Phoenix in court, Apollo is brought into the Wright Talent Agency as their attorney, Trucy changing the name to the Wright Anything Agency. Phoenix continues to work behind the scenes, helping to bring the truth behind his disbarment to light, as well as implement a jury system to the fictional justice system. In the years after losing his badge, Phoenix also develops a talent for poker, which he plays to determine the intents of those around him by reading their body language (\\"tells\\"), and is said to be nigh unbeatable at it. After clearing his name, Phoenix retakes the bar exam, regaining his badge and once again becoming a defense attorney. He also retains Apollo Justice as a proteg√©, and takes newcomer Athena Cykes under his wing as the newest junior attorney for the Wright Anything Agency. He later reunites with Maya in the fictional Kingdom of Khura'in and helps to change the country's legal system, after which point they become legal partners once again. Appearances =Ace Attorney video games= In the first game, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Phoenix must contend with the loss of his mentor and fellow defense attorney Mia Fey. Throughout the game, Phoenix is hired to defend various people of murder, including his friend Larry Butz and Mia's younger sister Maya Fey. The game culminates with Phoenix defending rival prosecutor Miles Edgeworth from being convicted for the murder of Robert Hammond, an old defense attorney who was involved in the DL-6 case, wherein Edgeworth's father was murdered. Going up against Edgeworth's mentor, Manfred von Karma, Phoenix successfully defends his friend and clears him of all charges, and destroys von Karma's 40 year-long winning streak. In Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Justice for All, Phoenix once again defends Maya, and faces the prosecutor and daughter of Manfred von Karma, 18-year-old legal prodigy Franziska. In the game's climax, Maya is kidnapped by a hitman, forcing Phoenix to make the true killer admit his guilt, which results in his first loss. In the course of the game, Phoenix receives a magic Magatama from Pearl that is able to reveal whether a person is hiding a secret in their heart, involving the use of Psyche Locks. In Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Trials and Tribulations, it is revealed that Phoenix was framed for the murder of his girlfriend's ex-lover while in college. He was defended by Mia Fey, who had not taken a case since her first against Edgeworth the year before. Mia exposes the true murderer as Phoenix's girlfriend, Dahlia Hawthorne, who is later executed. Through Mia's actions and defense, Phoenix is inspired to switch his major to law. Phoenix must also contend with a fake \\"Phoenix\\" who posed as him in court and got his friend and former client, Maggey Byrde, a guilty verdict. Phoenix also faces the mysterious Godot, a prosecutor who appears to harbor a grudge towards him. It is revealed in the final case, that during his years at the university, he was dating Iris, a temple nun and Dahlia's twin, who posed as her sister to save Phoenix's life from the wrath of Dahlia. During a case seven years prior to the events of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, two months after Trials and Tribulations, he was forced to forfeit his attorney's badge after presenting evidence that, unknown to him, was forged. Two weeks later, he adopted Trucy Enigmar after her father, his client Shadi Enigmar, became a fugitive. Trucy then renames his office the \\"Wright Talent Agency\\", becoming its CEO and one half of the represented talent, with Phoenix being the other half. At the time Apollo Justice takes place, he works as a pianist and plays poker at the Borscht Bowl Club. After being accused of murder himself and being successfully defended by rookie defense attorney Apollo Justice, he hires Apollo, reopening his law office as the \\"Wright Anything Agency\\". Wright uses the \\"MASON System\\" computer program to assist the player in piecing together the evidence from both past and present for the game's final case, where the circumstances regarding the day he was disbarred are fully explained. Wright returns as the protagonist in the fifth main series installment, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Dual Destinies. Having regained his attorney's badge, he works together on cases with both Apollo Justice and newcomer Athena Cykes, striving to put the \\"Dark Age of the Law\\" to an end once and for all. In the sixth game in the series, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Spirit of Justice, Phoenix travels to the Kingdom of Khura'in, where he reunites with Maya Fey, and discovers that defense attorneys are reviled throughout the kingdom, having a reputation of abiding criminals. He successfully defends his young tour guide and Maya when they are both accused of murder, putting himself at severe risk of falling afoul of the Kingdom's Defense Culpability Act, which states that defense attorneys of parties found guilty are to receive the same sentence as their client. Phoenix's actions begin the wheels of revolution turning, when he encounters a rebel group known as the Defiant Dragons, and finds out that their leader, a once renowned defense attorney named Dhurke Sahdmadhi, aims to restore the legal system to its proper state. =Other appearances= Hiroki Narimiya as Phoenix Wright in Ace Attorney. Phoenix Wright appears in a Japanese manga adaptation of the series, written by Kenji Kuroda, illustrated by Kazuo Maekawa and published by Kodansha. The series was published in the United States by Kodansha USA. An additional manga, published by Del Rey Manga, was released in the United States. A Japanese musical based on the series, staged by the all-female troupe, Takarazuka Revue, cast actor Tomu Ranju as Phoenix Wright, using the English name rather than the Japanese \\"Ry≈´ichi Naruhod≈ç\\", featuring Phoenix in a romantic relationship with Leona Clyde, an original character based on Lana Skye. A sequel, Ace Attorney 2 ‚àí Truth Resurrected, Again, was produced after the first musical sold out on the first day. Two Japanese stage plays have additionally been performed by the Super Eccentric Theater in which Sho Kato portrays Phoenix, the second of which featured Phoenix embarking in a romantic relationship with Maya Fey. Hiroki Narimiya portrays Phoenix in the 2012 live-action film Ace Attorney. The film loosely adapts the events of the first game, including Phoenix's first case, his meeting with Maya, and his defense of Edgeworth; the end credits sequence additionally adapt elements of the second game. Phoenix appears as the lead character of the 2016 Ace Attorney anime series, which adapts the events of the first three games in the series. He is voiced by Y≈´ki Kaji in Japanese and Eric Vale in English. Phoenix also makes a background cameo appearance in the episode \\"Killing a Domineering Grannie\\" of Scissor Seven. Within his own series, Phoenix makes a cameo appearance in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, a game starring his longtime rival Miles Edgeworth, as well as in its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2. He also stars alongside Professor Layton in the 2012 Nintendo 3DS title, Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, developed by Level-5. The developers of the crossover fighting game, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, had wanted to include Phoenix along with Franziska von Karma as a character on the roster, but had trouble designing additional moves besides his finger-pointing gesture. Though they had come up with an attack that used his catch-phrase \\"Igiari!\\" (\\"Objection!\\" in English), with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the four- character phrase (in kanji) to a nine-letter word and would have unbalanced the game. Phoenix was also considered for inclusion as a playable fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, appearing alongside Miles Edgeworth as a cameo in She-Hulk's arcade mode ending. He appears as a playable character in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. His fighting style sees him gather evidence on the field which he can use to either attack his opponent or save for a powerful courtroom confrontation. Phoenix, along with Franziska von Karma, Mia Fey and Miles Edgeworth, appear as cards in the game SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS. Both Phoenix and his assistant Maya Fey also appear as a two in one solo unit in the crossover tactical role-playing game Project X Zone 2. Reception Phoenix Wright has generally been praised by critics for being a likeable character with a realistic profession. However, the older Phoenix Wright seen in Apollo Justice has been criticized as \\"aloof and inscrutable\\", with \\"his character's development...lost along the wayside.\\" GameDaily called him the eighth greatest Capcom character, citing how he perseveres in the face of hardships. They also named him 20th on their \\"Top 25 Gaming Hunks.\\" They included his hairstyle in the list of \\"weirdest hairstyles in gaming.\\" Nintendo Power listed Phoenix as their 10th favourite hero, stating that while lawyers get a bad rap, Phoenix is one who defends the innocent. In 2009, GameSpot chose him as one of the characters to compete in their poll for the title of \\"All Time Greatest Game Hero\\". His appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was also positively received, with Metro GameCentral describing him as \\"the star of the show.\\" In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 55th best hero in video games while UGO Networks ranked him as the 57th best hero in entertainment in 2010. GamesRadar also included him in a list of \\"The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years\\", remarking that he has no power, and \\"isn't even that good of a lawyer when he starts out, but watching him grow is part of why we love him.\\". Phoenix Wright's signature mannerisms, such as finger-pointing and cries of \\"Objection!\\", have become well-known, and were parodied in episodes of anime such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, No Game No Life and Maria Holic.

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Roy Anderson (David Denman) tries to attack Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) for kissing Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) on Casino Night, only to be pepper-sprayed by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Jim repeatedly tries to thank Dwight for his actions, but each attempt is rejected. Meanwhile, with Roy fired, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asks for a raise and is astounded when he learns that this raise would cause him to be paid more than his boss, Michael Scott (Steve Carell). It first aired on April 5, 2007 on NBC as a longer, \\"super-sized\\" episode. It was written by Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz, and featured the end of Roy's plot arc to win back Pam, his former fianc√©e. The episode also included the return of actor Ed Helms, who portrays Andy Bernard. The episode was first screened at Paleyfest in early 2007. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by an estimated audience of 6.7 million people and earned a 3.2/10 ratings share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews, with television critics in particular praising the Dwight‚ÄìAngela storyline. Schur received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but lost to fellow Office writer Greg Daniels for his work on \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\". Synopsis Roy Anderson (David Denman) enters the office and tries to attack Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) for kissing Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), his former fianc√©e, but Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) subdues him with pepper spray, also accidentally getting himself and others. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) fire Roy, and a grateful Jim tries to show his appreciation to Dwight for saving him, but each gesture is coolly rejected, as Dwight believes he only acted in the line of duty and thus is undeserving of any special praise. Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy attacked him but her assurance that her relationship with Roy is over for good is met with skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim but she says she will not try to get him due to him dating Karen. Roy says he does not understand Pam before leaving. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) repeatedly gets people from the office to tell her the tale of Dwight's heroics, constantly arousing her. Believing themselves to be alone at the end of the day, the two kiss passionately. However, Jim sees them and decides that keeping their relationship secret will be his gift to Dwight to make things \\"even\\". Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from anger management, and a vindictive Dwight subdues him with pepper spray. This prompts Toby to confiscate the rest of Dwight's arsenal hidden in his desk. Meanwhile, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asks Michael for a 10 percent raise due to the extra workload resulting from Roy's absence. When he discovers that the raise would make him higher-paid than Michael, Darryl goads Michael into going to Corporate to negotiate his own raise. Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) initially tries to keep their romantic relationship out of the negotiations but ultimately gives Michael the maximum 12 percent raise that was authorized despite his continued inability to negotiate properly. Elsewhere, Toby becomes considerably annoyed with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling)'s constant making out and arguing in the cubicle next to his. Production \\"The Negotiation\\" was written by supervising producer Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. It concluded a story arc featuring Roy Anderson's attempt to win back Pam, his former fianc√©e. Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was \\"really grateful\\" that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, \\"where all of a sudden, he wasn't just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It's so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that.\\" Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was \\"inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together\\" and end the series' love triangle. \\"Otherwise,\\" he explained, \\"it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time [to leave], and I had such a great experience working with all those guys.\\" Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim‚ÄìPam storyline \\"to the next stage,\\" rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons. \\"The Negotiation\\" featured the last regular appearance of David Denman, who played Pam's former fianc√© Roy. Actress Kate Flannery, who plays Meredith Palmer, attributed her love of the episode to Craig Robinson, because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode \\"Basketball\\". She explained, \\"We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer. We sound good together, but sometimes people are not in the mood to hear our amazing duets, mostly from the '80s.\\" Flannery believed that Robinson's performance in the episode was \\"very funny,\\" as his character served as a \\"great foil for Michael Scott.\\" \\"The Negotiation\\" featured the return of character Andy Bernard, who had last been seen in the episode \\"The Return\\", as he was attending anger management classes. At the time \\"The Return\\" aired, no one was certain Helms would be returning, but in early February, NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular for the rest of the year. In early 2007, the first half of \\"The Negotiation\\" was screened before fans at Paleyfest, along with its preceding episode, \\"Cocktails\\". According to Eric Goldman of IGN, \\"the crowd reacted gleefully to watching the series in the group setting... laughing uproariously at the never ending stream of terrifically funny material.\\" Part of \\"The Negotiation\\" involved Michael Scott reading the English Wikipedia entry on negotiations for advice in his attempt to fend off Darryl's request for a pay raise. This scene triggered a plethora of activity around that particular article, as viewers added their own thoughts on the subject. It was ultimately placed into \\"semi- protection\\" mode by English Wikipedia administrators to discourage false information and vandalism among anonymous IP users. One hundred edits were added before the security protection was added.  Reception  \\"The Negotiation\\" first aired on April 5, 2007 in the United States on NBC as a \\"super-sized\\" episode, a term used by the network and media outlets to indicate an unusually long episode. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by an estimated 6.7 million people and earned a 3.2/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, the highest of the night. This means that it was seen by 3.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Alt URL The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN's Brian Zoromski rated \\"The Negotiation\\" 9.7 out of 10, an indication of an \\"amazing\\" episode. He opined that it \\"had something for everyone ‚Äì uncomfortable moments, laugh-out-loud ridiculous situations, and scenes progressing various ongoing storylines.\\" Writing for AOL TV, Jay Black sympathized with Roy's actions but faulted the writers for \\"just treading water\\" with the Jim-Pam relationship. Though he called the episode a \\"let down\\", Black did find some episode highlights, such as Angela's \\"lusty\\" responses to Dwight's defense of Jim. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A. In her review for Give Me My Remote, Kath Skerry wrote that the episode \\"left me satisfied and smiling,\\" (a reference to a line from the episode \\"Sexual Harassment\\") partly attributing this to Roy's attack as a \\"way to make a very heavy, not [so] funny moment hysterical.\\" She again expressed her dislike for Karen, but thought it \\"was a fun episode for my two favorite Dunder Mifflin couples: Ryan & Kelly and Dwight & Angela.\\" Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed the Dwight-Angela scenes, asserting that \\"some of the best moments on screen are when those two let their freak flags fly.\\" For his work on this episode, Michael Schur received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but lost to Greg Daniels for his work on \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\".

It has large well formed fruit clusters with thick bloom. It is a slip skin variety, meaning that the skin separates easily from the fruit. The grapes are used to make wine, most notably Uhudler and Fragolino. The Isabella being of the genus Vitis x Labruscana imparts a \\"foxiness\\" to the wine and because of this is thought to be objectionable, therefore it is not seen as a grape capable of making fine wines. For the table the flavour is good though with the astringent tough skin and \\"foxy\\" aroma is objectionable for some tastes.winemaking.jackkeller.net Winemaking Questions, Page 2: Isabella Grapes The deciduous vine is very easy to propagate. When the vine is bare of leaves in winter, it is good to prune the vine back by about one-third. Save the branches that are 15 cm long and pencil-thick. Cut straight across at the proximal end (nearest the root), and oblique at the distal end. Put a bundle of about 10 cuttings in potting mix, the flat ends down, and keep reasonable moist throughout winter. They will sprout leaves and roots in spring. Divide and plant out. History Photographic plate of Isabella grape from the book The Grapes of New York, 1908 by Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick Isabella, although popularly classified as being of Vitis labrusca parentage, is almost certainly a cross with an unknown Vitis vinifera, illustrated by the susceptibility to mildew and black rot. It is thought that it resulted from random pollination when European Vitis vinifera grapes were attempted to be established in America.wineloverspage.com The Super Gigantic Y2K Winegrape Glossary: Isabella It was popularly thought to have been discovered by a Mrs Isabella Gibbs of South Carolina in 1816, however there is conflicting information with other sources stating it was found in Virginia, Delaware and Europe. Isabella vines were heavily imported into Europe in the early 19th century and it is said that it is probable that the phylloxera was introduced into Europe on the roots of Isabella -- Isabella having a resistance to the phylloxera. =Modern history= In the European Union, Isabella is no longer a commercially important grape as it produces wines with a noticeable labrusca flavor, which is considered undesirable by many Western European connoisseurs. New plantings were banned in France after 1934. As a high yielding grape capable of withstanding tropical and semi- tropical conditions, it has been planted in Portugal, Bali, Japan, and various locations in the southern hemisphere such as in Colombia and Brazil, where it is a leading grape variety. In the U.S. it is sparsely grown in New York State. due to its phylloxera resistance and its cold hardiness. Isabella grapes must One of the most popular grapes in the former USSR, Isabella was brought to former Soviet nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Moldova from France through Odessa. That's one of the reasons this variety is also called Odessa among Georgians. Russian poet Osip Mandelstam had described Isabella as \\"fleshy and heavy like a cluster of night itself\\".

Small GTPases act as molecular switches in signaling pathways, which act to regulate functions of other proteins. They are active or 'ON' when it is bound to GTP and inactive or 'OFF' when bound to GDP. Activation and deactivation of small GTPases can be regarded as occurring in a cycle, between the GTP-bound and GDP-bound form, regulated by other regulatory proteins. Exchangers The inactive form of GTPases (GDP-form) are activated by a class of proteins called Guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs catalyse nucleotide exchange by encouraging the release of GDP from the small GTPase (by displacement of the small GTPase-associated Mg2+ ion) and GDP's replacement by GTP (which is in at least a 10-fold excess within the cell) . Inactivation of the active small GTPase is achieved through hydrolysis of the GTP by the small GTPase's intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity. Stimulators The rate of GTP hydrolysis for small GTPases is generally too slow to create physiologically relevant transient signals, and thus requires another class of regulatory proteins to accelerate this activity, the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Inhibitors Another class of regulatory proteins, the Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), bind to the GDP-bound form of Rho and Rab small GTPases and not only prevent exchange (maintaining the small GTPase in an off-state), but also prevent the small GTPase from localizing at the membrane, which is their place of action.

K. Narayan. It takes place, as do many other novels and short stories by this author, in the town of Malgudi. The central character in this book is the financial expert Margayya, who offers advice to his fellow townspeople from under his position at the banyan tree. He is a man of many aspirations and this novel delves into some level of psychological analysis.The Financial Expert tells the story of the rise and fall of Margayya. The theme of the novel is lust for money. But Margayya is no monster of greed and wickedness. In his depiction of Margayya, Narayan humanises him and shows that despite his lust for money, he is still a human being. Plot The protagonist of the novel, Margayya begins his career as petty money-lender doing his business under the Bunyan tree, in front of the Central Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank in Malgudi. He helps the shareholders of the bank to borrow money at a small interest and lends it to the needy at a higher interest. In the process, he makes money for himself. The Secretary of the Bank and Arul Doss, the peon, seize from his box the loan application forms he has managed to get from the Bank through its shareholders; they treat him with contempt, and threaten to proceed against him. This sets the path of improving his position. Balu, his spoilt-child throws his account book, containing all the entries of his transactions with his clients into the gutter, and it becomes impossible for Margayya to resume his old practice. He shows his horoscope to an astrologer and is assured that good times will come for him if he offers puja to Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth. The puja is done for forty days, with ash from a red lotus and ghee made of milk from a grey cow. Margayya goes through the puja with all rigour and at the end of it is full of a prosperous career. Dr. Pal, who sells him the manuscript of a book on Bed Life, for whatever ready cash Margayya's purse contains, assures him that the book named Domestic Harmony will sell in tens of thousands if only he can find a publisher. Madan Lal, ‚Äúa man from the North‚Äù, reads the manuscript and agrees to publish it on a fifty-fifty partnership basis. The book is at once popular and sells like hot cakes and Margayya hits a fortune. Margayya is again ruined through his son Balu. He had admitted him in school in great style, getting the blessing of his brother and sister-in-law next door. His wealth had made him become the Secretary of the School Managing Committee. This had armed him with enough power over the Headmaster and the School Staff. He had engaged a private tutor for his son and instructed him to thrash the boy whenever necessary. But Balu was not good in his studies. He could not clear his S.S.L.C. He tried to persuade him to take the examination for he second time. The result was that Balu seized the School Leaving Certificate Book, tore it into for quarters and threw them into the gutter the same gutter which closed its dark waters over Margayya's red account book, carried away the School Leaving Certificate Book. Then Balu ran away from home. A few days later there was a letter from Madras telling Margayya that his son was dead. The brother's family immediately comes to his help, though Margayya felt that he could do without their help and wondered if that would change the existing relationship between them. He left for Madras, discovered through the good offices of a fellow traveller a police inspector in plain clothes that his son was not really dead, traced the boy and brought him home. He wanted to marry him to a girl named Brinda, the daughter of the owner of a tea estate in Mempi Hills. When a pundit, after an honest study, declared that the horoscopes of Balu and Brinda did not match, he was curtly dismissed with a fee of one rupee. Another astrologer, whom Dr. Pal found, gave it in writing that the two horoscope matched perfectly and was paid Rs. 75 for his pains. ‚ÄúMoney can dictate the very stars in their course.‚Äù Balu and his wife were helped to set up an establishment of their own in Lawley Extension. Margayya, wishing to draw Dr. Pal away from his son, sought his help in attracting deposits from Black Marketers on the promise of an interest of 29%. If he got Rs. 20,000 deposit each day and paid Rs. 15, 000 in interest, he had still Rs. 5000 a day left in his hands as his own. Margayya became rich. It was now necessary for him to own a car. Every nook and corner of his house was stuffed with sacks full of currency notes. He was on the right side of the police, contributed to the War Fund when driven to do so, and worked day and night with his accounts and money bags, though his wife was unhappy at his straining himself so much. One day Margayya visited his son in Lawley Extension. He found Brinda and her child. The girl could not hold back her tears, while narrating Balu's nocturnal activities. When Margayya got out of the house, he found a car halting in front of it. Out of which emerged Balu. His companions were Dr. Pal and a couple of women in the town. The enraged Margayya pulled Dr. Pal out of the car, beat him and dismissed the two women with contempt. The next day Dr. Pal with a bandaged face whispered to all and sundry that things were not going well with Margayya's concerns. Hundreds of people swarmed Margayya and pressed him to return their deposits forthwith. All the accumulated wealth was disbursed. Still hundreds of people could not be satisfied. The run on the Bank led to Maragayya's filing an insolvency petition. And thus like a house of cards the wealth that Margayya had accumulated was blown away. He advised his son to take his place under the Banyan tree with the old box. When Balu hesitated to do that for fear of what people would say about it, Margayya offered to do so himself.

Stockton Chair of International Law at the United States Naval War College has its origins in the Naval War College's oldest civilian academic post. The first civilian academic at the College, James R. Soley was appointed in 1885 to lecture on international law. Dr. Freeman Snow of Harvard University gave lectures on the subject in 1894, his death in the midst of the academic program led to the appointment then Commander Charles Stockton to complete his lectures and to publish them for the use of the Navy. Stockton prepared a new edition in 1898, teaching classes in the subject. In 1901, Professoe John Bassett Moore lectured on international law and recommended that the college appoint Harvard University Law professor George Grafton Wilson as the visiting professor. Wilson lectured annually from 1901 to 1937. From 1946 to 1953, Professor Manley Hudson of Harvard regularly came from Cambridge to give the College's International Law lectures. On 11 July 1951, the Chief of Naval Personnel approved the formal establishment of a full-time professorship to replace the part-time position. On 6 October 1967, the Secretary of the Navy designated the academic post as the Charles H. Stockton Chair of International Law in honor of Rear Admiral Charles Stockton, President of the Naval War College (1891 and 1898-1900), who had been the US Navy's first uniformed expert in international law. The Stockton Chair was filled by distinguished visiting professors from its establishment until 2014, when the Chairperson of the Stockton Center for International Law was designated as the Stockton Professor. At that time, the Naval War College established the position of Charles H. Stockton Distinguished Scholar-in- Residence, to be held by visiting scholars of the international academic distinction.

Built as a boys' school, it became mixed-sex in 2012. History In 1956, the original buildings were completed when West Twerton School at The Hollow moved to Rush Hill as a secondary modern school, and changed its name to Westhill Boys' School, administered by Bath Education Authority. In 1966, sufficient funding was raised by the efforts of staff, pupils and the local community to enable an open-air swimming pool to be built within the school grounds. After 1969, the pool was covered. The pool measures and is from deep. It has been equipped with facilities for disabled users, and is open to the public in the evenings and at weekends. In 1971, Culverhay School was formed when the City of Bath reorganised secondary education by merging grammar schools and secondary modern schools to form comprehensive schools. Westhill Boys' Secondary Modern School and City of Bath Technical School were merged. The first headmaster was Colin Bayne-Jardine, a noted author of both history and educational management books. The school was one of the largest comprehensive schools in south west England at this time, with a nine form entry of around 250 boys and a total roll in excess of 1,200. The school won the Schools National Angling Championship in 1977. Having previously achieved fourth place in 1976 the school was fourth in 1978 and second in 1979 from an initial national entry of over 160 and a final of 40 teams. Angling Times named the school's Angling Club its school club of the year in 1977. The club was unusual in being organised by pupils and not staff, but it had the support of the local club, Bath AA, and fishing tackle shop, Fishcraft. In 2004, Culverhay was awarded specialist status in mathematics and computing. In 2006, the school received one of four prizes in the national Sport Relief programme's competition for schools, for a plan devised by the pupils to raise money for the programme by travelling by running, swimming, cycling and kayaking. The swimmer Sharron Davies visited the school to award the prize. Culverhay received the International School Award in recognition of its links with schools abroad, providing opportunities for students to visit other countries and to learn about their cultures. It achieved the Healthy Schools Award for its work in pupil health education. Extra curricular activities encouraged children to extend their academic interests into the local community. It was awarded the Gold Sportsmark in 2008 for its commitment to sport training. In 2006, Ofsted judged the school to be satisfactory on a four-point scale of outstanding, good, satisfactory and poor. Some aspects of the school were rated as good, but the sixth form was given an overall rating of poor. In 2009, Ofsted inspected the school again and upgraded its rating to good. The sixth form also received the same good rating. The report, which praised the school's improvement since the previous inspection, did note that Culverhay has a higher than average number of pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities, and that the number of pupils with a statement of special educational needs was almost double that of other schools. In 2009, Culverhay was the worst performing school in Bath and North East Somerset, with 38% of pupils achieving five or more GCSE passes at grade C or higher including mathematics and English. In 2010, the pass rate dropped to 31%, again the lowest in the area. In 2010, the school was identified for closure by Bath and North East Somerset council because of the large reduction in pupil numbers, from 476 at the time of the Ofsted inspection in May 2006 to 401 in May 2009. In January 2011, there were 348 pupils. A consultation on the school's closure took place in September and October 2010. Despite 74% of respondents saying they were against, the council backed the closure, so no new pupils were to be admitted from September 2012. However, in September 2011, the decision to close the school was revoked after an independent assessment deemed that the school was sustainable as a co-educational establishment. ¬£700,000 in funding was to be provided by the council for the necessary alterations. The school would remain financially viable as it was proposed to make a reduction in pupil intake levels as well. In October 2011, government approval was received for Culverhay to become a sponsored academy run by Cabot Learning Federation. Bath Community Academy Bath Community Academy opened in the same buildings in 2012 as an 11‚Äì19 co-educational secondary school, part of the Cabot Learning Federation based in Bristol. Subjects taught at the academy included art, child development, computing, dance, design technology, drama, English and literacy, geography, history, iMedia, mathematics, modern foreign languages, music, physical education, religious education and science. The academy had its own radio station called Phoenix Radio which won two Sony Schools Radio Academy awards, in 2009 and 2012. In 2014, there were 274 students, including boys in years 7 to 11 and a co-educational sixth form. On 18 July 2016 the Cabot Learning Foundation announced that the school would close, stating that the school was not \\"sustainable or viable\\" due to low pupil numbers. The school closed on 24 July 2018.  Bath Spa University  Part of the former school is used by Bath Spa University, primarily for teach training.

It is edited as 65 episodes. The series premiered on the History Channel in September 1998 where it prevailed in the 8 o'clock Sunday evening slot for over two years. The series was co-created by Supervising Producers John Corry and Chip Proser. Alan Beattie and Chris Chesser served as Executive Producers. Original musical score composed and conducted by Ram√≥n Balc√°zar. Narrated by Charlton Heston, the series details facts and information derived from rare archival footage, formerly classified documents and messages, coupled with interviews with experts, authors and eyewitnesses from all over the world.  Production notes  The series was originally conceived as a 26-hour production. The first 13 hours concentrated on World War II, and the vast amount of unknown history kept secret by the British Official Secrets Act and finally revealed from 1975 to the 1990s. The second 13 hours focused on other conflicts of the 20th century. After the success of the first season, Documedia proceeded to expand the series comprehensively to address other wars, battles and intrigues, including many colour present-day shows on topics as diverse as chemical weapons and spy planes, and theme-oriented episodes like prisoners of war and code breakers. The series interviewed key participants in all of the important conflicts of the 20th century, including prominent authors with unique perspectives of the clandestine aspects of war. The creators of Sworn To Secrecy worked with the top spies of the era: former Directors of the CIA James Woolsey, Richard Helms and Dr. James Schlesinger; former Chairmen of the KGB Generals Vladimir Semichastny and Alexander Shelepin (Russia); as well as former directors of the MOSSAD Meir Amit and Isser Harel. As Sworn To Secrecy gained notoriety, other VIPs who usually avoided commenting on the topics explored by the series participated in this unique documentary production, including: Henry Kissinger, Robert McNamara, Dan Quayle, John H. Sununu, James A. Baker III, Jack Valenti, Howard K. Smith, John K. Singlaub, David Eisenhower, Dr. Sergei Khrushchev, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Senator John McCain. Each one-hour episode tells a strong, specific and factual story, backed up by interviews, rare footage, 3D graphics, on- location shooting, historical retracing shots and extensive reenactments. Sworn To Secrecy is, among many documentary series of its kind, used in the classrooms of the United States Naval Academy and United States Air Force Academy, and the only military series that American Forces Network (formerly the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service) licenses for American Service men and women on military bases and ships worldwide.

A book on his work, titled Architecture of the Air was released in February, 2007. He currently lives in Lexington, Massachusetts. Biography Janney grew up in Washington, D.C.. He received a B.A. degree (1973, magna cum laude) from Princeton University (where he studied with Michael Graves, James Seawright and Rosalind Krauss). After graduation, he studied percussion and music at the Dalcroze School of Music (see Eurhythmics) and Mannes College of Music in New York, performed jazz and worked with various artists and dance companies (including Merce Cunningham Dance and Sara Rudner 18th St. Company, Jack Youngerman, Claes Oldenburg). He received an MS (1978) in Environmental Art at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; his thesis (under Otto Piene) was titled SOUNDSTAIR: The Nature of Environmental/Participatory Art. While also a Research Fellow at MIT, Janney developed his own multi-media studio, PhenomenArts, Inc., in 1980, combining his interests in music and architecture. He has created numerous permanent interactive sound/light installations and performances, including Harmonic Runway at the Miami Airport and REACH:NY, 34th St. Subway in New York, HeartBeat:mb with Sara Rudner and Mikhail Baryshnikov, and \\"Soundstair\\" (musical stairs),most recently at the Boston Children's Hospital. He has been awarded the Gryorgy Kepes Price from MIT (1986), \\"Sound Designer of the Year,\\" by LDI/Theater Arts Magazine (1985) and the Edison Award from General Electric for Innovation in Design (1996). His work has been profiled on CBS Sunday Morning, HGTV, Architectural Record, Metropolis Magazine, The New York Times, in a 30-minute award-winning documentary titled \\"Drum of Time\\" and, most recently \\"What Is A Heart?\\" Directed by Ted Bogosian. Janney lectures widely on his work. He has been a visiting professor at both The Cooper Union School of Architecture and Pratt Institute School of Architecture, where he has taught his seminar \\"Sound as a Visual Medium\\".

The community of Fairhaven first officially appeared on city maps circa 1971, in the same location as on the Yorath map, and the layout of streets in the community underwent several revisions before development began in earnest in the mid-1970s, with most construction in the area complete by 1985, however there remained undeveloped lots on the east side of the community that in the early 2010s were filled with the relocation of six-plex homes from the former McNab Park neighbourhood.

The storyline involves the opening of a new anomaly, when the team find themselves in an intense battle with a highly evolved predator, not from the past, but the future. Plot Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) is practicing putting in his office using a thin animal femur a little over 3 feet long as a club. Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown) visits him, wanting to talk about Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) and why she might have saved her (in episode 5). She also remembers that Nick kissed her (although she does not appear to be angry about it), causing Nick to miss his shot. Elsewhere Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) helps Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) practise chat-up lines for prospective nights out, although he is clearly more interested in her. Another anomaly has appeared in the Forest of Dean in the same place as the Episode One anomaly, bringing with it a terrible predator that possesses human-like intelligence and amazing agility, and tracks its prey using sonar-like abilities, much like a bat. It breaks through the perimeter surrounding the Forest of Dean, and makes its way to Wellington Zoo. Here, it breaks into the lion den and kills a lion. It leaves no trace of itself or the lion, except a smear of blood on a leaf. Abby has been called to the zoo because of the lions' disappearance, bringing Connor along. Connor takes a sample of this blood and has it tested, which shows it to be partly lion blood, and partly bat blood but with some weird differences in the DNA. The creature goes on to kill three people, including Abby's boss. Meanwhile, Helen returns, taking Stephen Hart (James Murray) aside in the university grounds. She reveals that there has been another creature incursion, but refuses to say more until she meets Nick and Lester. However, she does indicate she was pleased to see Stephen again, and kisses him on the lips as she departs. Lester agrees to the meeting (reluctantly). He, Claudia, Nick and Stephen meet her, and she tells Nick and the others that it is a highly developed predator from the future, that came through an anomaly into the Permian period and then through another anomaly into our period. Helen insists she has no idea how the creature found its way through, and that she just came back to help, having learned it was on the rampage, and decides to stay at her old house - Nick's house. At the house, Nick quizzes Helen as to her real motives. She reveals that the creature didn't come through on its own - she was observing it and it sensed her presence: in her haste to escape, she fled through the anomaly, and the creature followed her through to the present day. When Nick accuses her of causing the situation, Helen defends herself by saying she does still care enough to want to help stop it...and that she does still care about Nick. Stephen and Connor puzzle on the creature in Nick's office. Connor mentions the disappearance of Abby's boss and the lion. Stephen realises that the Predator must be hunting in that area and leaves to find Abby, telling Connor to bring backup. Abby is safe at the zoo, but at that moment the creature appears. It is unable to detect them due to the seals in the tank next to them, and flees when Ryan's men arrive. Realising the danger, Nick and Ryan's men hunt the creature in a search-and-destroy mission, using dogs to track it. The creature attacks them again, killing a soldier, then escapes into the trees. Connor notices that the dogs picked it up before they did, and concludes that it hunts by sound. The team concludes it is hunting by echolocation, and when Stephen and Connor mention the bat blood, they conclude it is a futuristic species of bat. Helen agrees to this, saying that 75% of all mammal species are bats or rats, and that possibly they are the species that becomes dominant. Nick sends Connor to the pickup for a laptop oscilloscope that picks up and displays the sound waves caused by the creature. While Connor is in the pickup, the creature jumps on the pickup and tries to break into it, but Abby distracts the creature. As it prepares to attack her, Stephen shoots and wounds the creature; it escapes into the forest. Despite being unnerved, Connor refuses to give up, reasoning Han Solo would never give up: Nick agrees, although noting he always saw Connor as R2-D2 himself. Connor thanks Abby for saving him. Using the oscilloscope, they find the den in an abandoned storage hut, and enter it. Inside they find that the creature has given birth to at least 5 young. Then the oscilloscope starts to react loudly, and the creature attacks, killing a soldier. Nick, thinking quickly, grabs an infant and runs into a nearby greenhouse. The creature follows and Nick shoots the glass above it, causing a shower of broken glass which reflects the creature's sound waves back at it, confusing its sonar sense. Taking advantage of the distraction, he shoots it in the head, killing it. Realising the creatures are too dangerous to stay in the present, and that they could wreak catastrophic damage on ecosystems in the past, Helen and Nick suggest using the infants to guide them to the anomaly leading from the Permian to the future: once they have found the anomaly into the future and make sure it closes, they will kill the infants, as they are too dangerous to be allowed to live, as well as stationing a permanent guard at the site of the future anomaly in case it reopens. Just before they enter the anomaly, Claudia kisses Cutter right in front of Helen, much to her surprise and to the disapproval of Lester. After Cutter and Helen have departed with the infants, Connor learns that an autopsy has shown that the creature was male: thus there is likely a female creature still at large. Almost immediately after, the female leaps through the anomaly, although the team in the present don't realise due to its speed. The landscape is conifer forest on hilly lava. A herd of Scutosaurus are on a hill opposite beyond a valley. Nick takes a picture of Helen as a souvenir. He then realizes that they were creating their own past and that that picture is the picture that they found in Episode One. Then he remembers the skeleton they found, and works out what is going to happen. Nick then realises Helen has been using him - she didn't care about him, she just wanted to find the future anomaly. The female creature catches up with them and attacks them. She attacks and kills all of Ryan's soldiers. Captain Ryan runs after the creature and shoots her twice but fails to deliver a fatal kill-shot to the creature. With his position now exposed, the predator attacks and mortally wounds Ryan. The predator turns towards the others but before she can attack Nick, an Inostrancevia appears, charging and briefly stunning the adult creature. Nick attends to Ryan, as the adult creature recovers - to see her young being eaten by the Inostrancevia. The two predators battle; the gorgonopsid loses an eye and suffers wounds in the process. Despite this, the Inostrancevia emerges victorious as it rears and falls over backwards, crushing the creature beneath its weight. The Inostrancevia roars in victory and then retreats with the creature's body. Nick aids Captain Tom Ryan (Mark Wakeling), who had also worked out that the skeleton in Episode One was his own, before dying. Helen confirms that none of the creature's young have survived, and she and Nick bury the dead men in the Permian and return through the anomaly, despite Helen's pleas that they could stay in the past and find the future anomaly. Unseen by the group, two of the baby future predators are left climbing a tree as the group retreats to the present. Helen and Nick sadly tell the others that Captain Ryan didn't make it and that all his soldiers died as well. Nick then says that no one else is to go through the anomaly. Helen immediately reveals she is not staying. Trying to avoid going back alone, Helen reveals that before she disappeared she had an affair with Stephen, much to Nick's fury. However, Stephen refuses to go with her. Helen then walks back through the anomaly. Nick asks where Claudia is, and to his shock finds that no-one there knows of any Claudia Brown.

Although the Ant is widely regarded as a military vehicle, some sources suggest it was conceived with civilian use in mind as well.Article \\"Ant Hill Mob\\" in Classic and Sports Car magazine, March 2007, published by Haymarket Publishing Ltd., United Kingdom In its military role, it was a potential successor to the military version of an earlier Issigonis design, the Mini Moke. The Ant was cancelled in 1968 before full-scale production began, during the period when BMC became part of the British Leyland (BL) conglomerate; the merger caused several overlaps in model ranges, and the Ant was regarded as too close a competitor for the Land Rover range.The unofficial Austin-Rover web resource; Austin Drawing Office numbers The Ant used an A-Series engine, transverse mounted and tilted slightly backward to allow greater ground clearance and suspension movement. The main gearbox was placed in the engine sump, as on the Mini. A reduction gearbox took power from the main gearbox to the rear axle via a propshaft. The same layout was used 30 years later (with a K-Series engine) on the Rover Group's Land Rover Freelander.

Lynn (April 28, 1924 ‚Äì June 11, 2002) formalized U.S. Army entertainment, beginning in Korea in the 1950s. Building on the tradition of Civil War camp shows, and a military show Yip Yip Yaphank created by Irving Berlin as a soldier in World War I, she eventually developed the U.S. Army Entertainment program, inspiring, supporting, and coordinating theatrical and music programs at Army bases worldwide. Biography Born Margaret Linskie, in Dallas, Texas, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University in 1942. In 1965, she was named the University's Distinguished Alumni Award [Dead link] as the \\"Woman of Achievement\\" for the decade of the 1940s. She earned a master's degree in Speech and Drama at Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, in 1943, studying with the renowned Rev. Gilbert V. Hartke, O.P. Under her stage name, Margaret Lynn, she was a dancer and dance captain with the Radio City Rockettes in New York City, and appeared in seven Broadway shows, including Oklahoma!, Carousel, and Mike Todd's Mexican Hayride. She played the ingenue lead, as well as understudying Ethel Merman in Something for the Boys. In 1945, she was chosen by Peggy Wood and Paul Green to be among the first civilian \\"actress technicians\\" employed by the U.S. government to work with troops overseas following World War II. Under commanding officer and stage director Joshua Logan, she worked on dozens of productions for the military. She continued to conceive and direct shows during the Korean War, bringing entertainment, sometimes under artillery fire, to military personnel of various United Nations units involved in that conflict. Achievements Lynn was eventually put in charge of soldier show entertainment at Army Headquarters in Washington, DC, where she organized companies of service personnel touring shows. In time she organized and supported a network of some 200 full-time civilian directors on military bases around the world. She obtained production and musical performance rights, created \\"How To\\" handbooks complete with scene designs and music. She set up worldwide Army Entertainment competitions, sending theatre professionals to bases to adjudicate shows, give support and feed-back to post entertainment directors, and select the best musical performers, who were then brought to Washington for a public showcase which she directed. The Washington Post observed that she had created \\"the largest producing organization of theatre and music in the world.\\" In addition to \\"soldiers entertaining soldiers\\", Lynn stressed the benefits of including dependent wives and children actively in the performing arts, and the desirability of involving civilians from nearby towns as an antidote to the social isolation of service personnel working far from home. Under her guidance, numerous workshops, showcases, worldwide competitions, and scholarships were established to discover and encourage talented members of the military. Under Lynn's ambitious inspiration, dedicated music rehearsal facilities, proscenium stages, \\"black box\\" theatre studios, and dinner theatres were established in unused army movie houses, barracks, and other surplus facilities, where colonels, corporals, and civilians created theatre together. Not content with makeshift \\"soldier shows\\", her directors produced themed variety bills, Broadway musicals, comedy, serious drama, and occasionally Shakespeare. She loved to recount the great success of one of Father Hartke's Shakespeare productions from Catholic University, for which she arranged a tour of military bases. Enormous crowds cheered the comedy erroneously announced to troops stationed all over the Far East as \\"Love, Labor and Lust.\\" With her prot√©g√© Donn B. Murphy, she established summer workshops at Georgetown University to which she brought Army entertainment directors from all over the world who met with civilian theater directors, producers, and teachers. The caliber and breadth of the Army music and theatre activities from the 1950s into the 1980s are a tribute to Lynn and to the many professionals and amateurs whom she involved, inspired, and supported at installations at home and overseas. Extensive documentation on this work is preserved in the Margaret E. Lynn Army Music and Theatre Collection, 1967-1978 at the New York Public Library Performing Arts Research Center at Lincoln Center . In 1971, she assisted in arrangements for the debut of the Walt Disney World Symphony Orchestra, which brought together 145 musicians from 66 countries to perform concerts in New York at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and to celebrate the opening of Walt Disney World In Florida. In 1982, Lynn left the Department of the Army and formed her own company, called Creative Consultants. She was simultaneously named general manager of the World Showcase Festival Program for the Disney organization. She brought more than 1,100 dancers, singers, and other performing artists from 23 countries to Orlando for the opening of EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World on October 1, 1982. The groups, including Moroccan dancers and drummers, Italian flag twirlers and members of Canada's Royal Mounted Police, performed in the park's World Showcase area. Lynn also coordinated the gathering of water from rivers in far-flung parts of the globe, which were ceremoniously poured into the Fountain of Nations in the Future World section of EPCOT. Later in life, she taught evening theater classes for adults in Virginia, and organized theater-going experiences for them which involved play-going in Washington and after-show meetings with actors and directors, as well as trips to New York with Broadway shows and lunches at Vincent Sardi's famous theater restaurant.

Baby Jay was created by student Amy Sue Hurst and \\"hatched\\" at half-time of KU's Homecoming victory in football over Kansas State University on October 9, 1971, and has served as a mascot ever since. History In 1970 Amy Hurst saw a Jayhawk bumper sticker depicting Big Jay and hatchlings, which inspired her to create a new mascot. After talking to a co-worker who was a Big Jay and getting approval from the KU Alumni Association she created Baby Jay. The official debut of Baby Jay was October 9, 1971 during the half-time of KU's homecoming game against in-state rivals Kansas State University. In front of 55,000 fans Big Jay hauled a large egg to the 50-yard line of Memorial Stadium. A few moments later Baby Jay \\"hatched\\" from the artificial egg and has served as an ambassador of KU at events across the country ever since. The original costume weighed 30 pounds, consisted of chicken wire, fiberglass, and felt. The total cost was $53. In 2003, Amy Hurst, the original Baby Jay, started a fund to help cover the cost of the now $5,000 costume that is replaced every two years. Selection process The selection process to become Baby Jay is generally during the spring semester. Baby jay is typically a female student and must be between 4' 11\\" and 5' 1\\" tall. The auditioning process may also include 20 minutes of running, performing an entrance and exit routine, emotion and reaction exercises. The student applicant must create an original skit when trying out to be the mascot. The student must also meet several physical conditions. To apply you must turn in a packet of information that you must get from either the mascot coach or spirit squad director. This includes a video, a physical and student information. Duties The primary duty of Baby Jay is to be an ambassador of KU, roaming the sidelines at football and basketball games giving hugs to youngsters. Baby Jay, being smaller than Big Jay, is often involved in entertaining children. Baby Jay is also present at most major university events such as athletic competitions, Tradition Night, Band Spectacular, and graduation. Baby Jay is also seen in the community attending weddings, opening the Godzilla film festival, or even lobbying legislators to fund higher education. In return for these services Baby Jay receives a $300 scholarship per semester.
