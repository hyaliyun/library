They began with appearances at the Orlando International Fringe Festival in the late 1990s. Frequent appearances at the Jazz Club in Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World Resort's Downtown Disney have increased their fame. They have released several CDs and performed live, including a run off Broadway in 2004 and tours in Europe and Japan. They have also performed at \\"The Loft,\\" in Dayton, Ohio. Toxic Audio is popular for their dynamic and humorous performances, which often include audience participation. They are also adept at improvisation. They emphasize that all of the music and sound effects created in their performances are done entirely with their voices; no outside instruments are used. Five Toxic Audio albums have been released on CD with the addition of their new CD, 'Voice Activated' in May 2012. The group consists of five primary singers: *Michelle Mailhot-Valines, soprano. Her specialty is scat singing. *Shalisa James, alto. Her specialty is in knowing the exact lyrics to a vast number of songs. *Paul Sperrazza, tenor. He does beatboxing and is known as the \\"human beat box\\" who imitates percussion. *Jeremy James, baritone. He is skilled at rapping. *Ren√© Ruiz, bass, the founder and original director of the group. Other singers have been substituted on rare occasion. John Valines III is the group's technical director and audio engineer. The group's New York show, Loud Mouth, earned them the 2004 Drama Desk Award.

It was first used in Canada and the United States in the late 1940s, but it later fell out of favor with traffic engineers there, as it was seen as prioritizing flow of pedestrians over flow of car traffic. Its benefits for pedestrian amenity and safety have led to new examples being installed in many countries in recent years. Development A scramble crossing in Cologne, Germany King George Street and Jaffa Road pedestrian scramble in Jerusalem, Israel (2007) The name \\"Barnes Dance\\" commemorates traffic engineer Henry Barnes. While he did not claim to have invented it himself, Barnes was a strong advocate of it, having observed the difficulties his daughter experienced on her way to school. He first introduced it in his home city of Denver, Colorado in the late 1940s. Around this time, the pedestrian scramble was being tested separately in Kansas City and Vancouver. Barnes later brought it to Baltimore and New York City. When Barnes became traffic commissioner of New York City in 1962, his first action was to look for intersections to implement pedestrian scrambles. The first pedestrian scramble was installed ten days after he took office at the intersection of Vanderbilt Avenue and 42nd Street, to great acclaim. Following the success of this first scramble, Barnes began adding more scrambles across the city, at Wall Street; 42nd Street at Fifth Avenue and at Madison Avenue; and Brooklyn. In his autobiography The Man With the Red and Green Eyes (1965) Barnes recorded that a City Hall reporter, John Buchanan, first coined the phrase by writing that \\"Barnes has made the people so happy they're dancing in the streets.\\" Barnes later said, \\"As things stood now, a downtown shopper needed a four-leaf clover, a voodoo charm, and a St. Christopher's medal to make it in one piece from one curbstone to the other. As far as I was concerned‚Äîa traffic engineer with Methodist leanings‚ÄîI didn't think that the Almighty should be bothered with problems which we, ourselves, were capable of solving.\\" However, the Barnes Dance‚Äîofficially known as an \\"exclusive pedestrian interval\\" because vehicular traffic is stopped in all directions during a pedestrian scramble‚Äîcaused gridlock in some cities where it was implemented, such as New York City, where congestion increased due to longer wait times for lights. Robert Moses disliked the scrambles because they held up traffic. In locations such as Washington, D.C., pedestrian scrambles shorten the time allotted to each traffic-signal phase by one-third. One study of exclusive pedestrian intervals in Greenwich, Connecticut, found that it offered no extra benefits compared to a \\"concurrent pedestrian interval\\" where pedestrians cross when parallel traffic has the green light. In the United States, the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices allows pedestrian scrambles.  Application  =In Australia= In Adelaide, there are two scrambles on either end of Rundle Mall, King William Street and another on Pulteney Street. There is another crossing at the intersection of King William Street, Waymouth Street and Pirie Street. In Brisbane, there are two noteworthy scrambles: one in the central business district at the intersection of Adelaide and Edward Streets, adjacent to the Queen Street Mall; and a second at the intersection of Vulture and Boundary Streets in the suburb of West End. In Darwin, there is a pedestrian scramble at the CBD end of Smith St Mall. In Melbourne, there is a pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Flinders and Elizabeth Streets, in front of Flinders Street railway station, allowing pedestrians to walk directly to the station and the two island tram platforms in the middle of both streets. Also, since 2019 there is a four-way scramble at the intersection of Wellington St and Charles St in Kew (due to school pedestrian traffic through this intersection). A third scramble is located at the intersection of Irving and Leeds Streets, Footscray, next to Footscray Station. in Albury, there is a long-standing 4-way scramble on the busiest CBD intersection, Dean St and Kiewa St. In Perth, pedestrian scrambles are mostly found in the CBD shopping area (the intersections between two of Barrack, Hay, Murray and William Streets. They are also found at the CBD intersections of St Georges Terrace, Mount and Milligan Streets and where St Georges changes to Adelaide Terrace at Victoria Avenue. The inner suburb of Mount Lawley also has a set where Beaufort Street intersects Walcott Street as well as Leederville at the intersection of Oxford and Vincent Streets. In Sydney, there are numerous examples in built-up commercial and CBD areas, like the intersection of George and Druitt Streets (with one of the corner blocks being the Sydney Town Hall), Oxford Street and Bourke Street in Darlinghurst, Church Street in Parramatta also has them, as do the Penrith and Fairfield central business districts. = In Canada = Pedestrian scramble in Toronto Vancouver was one of the first cities worldwide to use the concept at individual locations. London, Ontario, had a Barnes' Dance crosswalk in the 1960s at the intersection of Clarence and King streets. In Toronto, the intersection of Yonge Street and Dundas Street, the location of Yonge-Dundas Square, has the city's first installed scramble intersection and has since been joined by two more on Bloor Street at Yonge and Bay Streets in the downtown area. In 2015, Toronto has eliminated the Bay and Bloor scramble crossing after an evaluation study found 'modest positive benefits for pedestrians' and 'negative impacts to vehicular traffic'. The staff report also noted that sideswipe collisions at Bay and Bloor have more than doubled and rear-end type crashes have increased by 50% ‚Äúlikely due to increased driver frustration‚Äù. Kingston, Ontario, has a scramble crosswalk at the corners of Union Street and University Avenue to increase the safety of Queen's University students. Calgary has two pedestrian scrambles in the Eau Claire neighbourhood. St. Albert, Alberta, has installed a test pedestrian scramble as of the end of May 2017. Edmonton has four as part of a pilot project, with plans for a fifth by early December. Quebec City and Banff also have a few pedestrian scramble intersections. = In China = Shanghai as of 2018, has 11 major intersections equipped with pedestrian scrambles across the city in busy commercial areas. Beijing opened its first pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Lugu West Street and Zhengda Road in 2018. Two pedestrian scrambles opened in Haikou in 2019. Guangzhou has two pedestrian scrambles as of 2019. Pedestrian scrambles also exist in Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Changzhou, Nantong and Yichang. Hong Kong has numerous intersections operating with an exclusive pedestrian interval but not timed for the longer diagonal crossings and are not marked as such. Diagonal crossing at these de-facto scramble crossings is illegal in Hong Kong. =In Japan= Pedestrian scramble at Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo Pedestrian scrambles, known as a , are very common in Japan, where more than over 300 such intersections exist. Japan's largest, and most famous, diagonal crossing is found in Tokyo, outside Shibuya station Over 3,000 pedestrians can cross in one scramble and has become a symbol of Tokyo and Japan as a whole. Sukiyabashi in Ginza is another large scramble crossing in Tokyo. Kansai also has many diagonal crossings, including four outside the north exit of Kyoto Station alone. Most of the diagonal crossings in Osaka are located in the south of the city, in Abeno ward. The first diagonal crossing to be installed in Japan was in the Kyushu city of Kumamoto in 1969. = In Luxembourg = In the southern town of Dudelange, there is a pedestrian scramble at the busy intersection of the route de Kayl, route de Luxembourg and rue Gaffelt. = In Mexico = In Downtown Tijuana diagonal pedestrian crossing with its own signal in the cycle has been applied at numerous intersections for decades. Currently the symbol to indicate pedestrian scramble is possible is a ribbon. https://www.elimparcial.com/amp/tijuana/tijuana/Semaforos-de-calle-Tercera-en- Zona-Centro-no-funcionan-desde-ayer-20170518-0037.html In 2019 Mexico City installed its first pedestrian scramble in the Historic Center (Centro Hist√≥rico). https://noticieros.televisa.com/historia/instalan-primer-cruce- peatonal-diagonal-cdmx/ =In the Netherlands= In the Netherlands, a version of this crossing, called a Simultaneous Green light for Bicyclists, combined with an all way green light for pedestrians, is currently being used in a number of intersections in the North and East of the Netherlands. =In New Zealand= In New Zealand, the first Barnes Dance was introduced in 1958 on Queen Street, Auckland, and was soon found in other cities as well. The Queen Street examples are Custom Street, Shortland, Wyndham, Victoria and Wellesley Street intersections. When Mayoral Drive was constructed in the 1970s it was not created as a Barnes Dance -indicative of a change in traffic management models. The Queen Street crossings remain today, despite early 2000s attempts to remove them for greater car priority, and have been extended with greater numbers of phases and pedestrian green times during the late 2000s. Additionally, some Barnes Dance intersections do not provide painted crossings and are therefore de facto, such as the intersection of Grafton Rd and Symonds St within the University of Auckland city campus. Karangahape Road had two such crossings ‚Äì the Queen Street / K Road intersection was modified in the 1990s but the Pitt Street / K Road intersection is still a Barnes Dance. On nearby Ponsonby Road there is a Barnes Dance at Franklin Road. There is a Barnes Dance on the Great North Road at the Surrey Crescent intersection with Williamson Avenue. There is also a Barnes Dance at the multiple street intersection of Lake Road, Hurstmere Road, Northcroft Street and The Strand in Takapuna. Barnes Dances also existed in several other cities in New Zealand, notably on Colombo Street, Christchurch and at Cargill's Corner in South Dunedin, but have been gradually phased out. Barnes Dances exist in the South Island on Stafford Street in Timaru and three in the Christchurch CBD. In Dunedin Barnes Dances were reintroduced early in 2018, with the first two of eight sites (on the Octagon's junctions with Princes and George Streets) opened in March. = In Taiwan = In Taiwan, the word \\"pedestrian scramble\\" was translated to \\"Ë°å‰∫∫Â∞àÁî®ÊôÇÁõ∏\\" in traditional Chinese by the transportation authority. In the 1990s, the first pedestrian scramble was implemented at the QingDao West Road and GongYuan Road intersection in the Zhongzheng District of Taipei City by the Taipei City Government. After then, more cities have applied pedestrian scrambles to important intersections and downtown areas in Taiwan like New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Keelung City, Hsinchu City, Chiayi City and Yilan County. = In the United Kingdom = 275x275px In 2002, Greater Manchester Urban Traffic (GMUTC) is currently understood to have installed the first diagonal crossing in the UK at the junction of Market Street and Beal Lane in Shaw, Oldham, Greater Manchester. The first formal diagonal crossing in London was opened in Balham town centre in 2005. The success of the Balham crossing was followed by conversion of the existing crossing facilities at Oxford Circus in 2009, Further diagonal crossings were constructed in Wood Green in 2010 and Wimbledon in 2012. Swansea opened a diagonal crossing in 2015. Harrogate also opened a diagonal crossing in 2015. Since opening, some have criticised the time given for pedestrians to cross and claim that poor design led to the death of an elderly pedestrian who was struck by a vehicle in its first year of operation. =In the United States= Kansas City was one of the first cities that used a pedestrian scramble system at a few locations. Denver formerly used the pedestrian scramble system at nearly every intersection in the downtown business district. The practice was eliminated on 11 April 2011, in order to \\"balance\\" resources allotted to pedestrians, vehicles, and mass transit. Exclusive pedestrian intervals were kept, but the diagonal crossing was made illegal. Sign for a pedestrian scramble in the United StatesIn Boston, most signalized intersections use an exclusive pedestrian phase, where vehicular traffic is stopped in all directions and it is possible for fast walkers to cross the street diagonally (even though the crosswalks are not marked as such). However, a growing number of traffic signals are being programmed to use a concurrent pedestrian phase. A similar situation exists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where intersections with exclusive intervals can allow fast walkers to cross the street diagonally. In Washington, D.C., diagonal crossing existed at several downtown intersections until the mid-1980s. It was tried again on an experimental basis at 7th and H streets Northwest in the Chinatown neighborhood beginning May 2010. In 2017, a second Barnes Dance crosswalk was added at Irving and 14th streets Northwest. In New Haven, all of the intersections with traffic lights have implemented the pedestrian scramble, since at least 1974. Union Square In New York City, there were 635 intersections with exclusive pedestrian phases , although the majority were \\"T-away\\" intersections (T-intersections where the cross street takes traffic away from the intersection) and mid-block crossings, where a pedestrian scramble was one of the two phases. Many of the remaining 86 intersections with pedestrian scrambles are located where intersection geometry is skewed, requiring diagonal crossings from pedestrians and/or an exclusive pedestrian phase due to conflicts with vehicular traffic. Major pedestrian scrambles include the intersection of Vesey Street, Broadway, Park Row, and Ann Street in Lower Manhattan, as well as Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn. Signals at several intersections in Pittsburgh, including along Craig Street at Centre Avenue, Bayard Street, Fifth Avenue, and Forbes Avenue near the University of Pittsburgh; on Forbes at Morewood Street at the main entrance to Carnegie Mellon University; and on Forbes at Murray and Shady Avenues in Squirrel Hill stop traffic from all directions and allow pedestrians to cross in all directions. They are not, however, specially signed; they use a standard pedestrian crossing light (with added audio signal for the visually impaired). The signal at the intersection of McKinley and Riverside Avenues on the campus of Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, is called the \\"Scramble Light\\" and is identified by the university as a campus landmark. Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, has numerous legal diagonal crosswalks in use around campus, as well as some through uptown. Some pedestrian scrambles are implemented only temporarily, during times when extremely high pedestrian traffic is expected. A notable example of this occurs on home-game Saturdays at the intersection of Main Street and Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is immediately adjacent to Michigan Stadium. Local police take control of the vehicular signals and indicate the pedestrian phase by playing Michigan's fight song, \\"The Victors.\\" The city of Honolulu on the island of Oahu in the state of Hawaii has installed multiple pedestrian scramble crossings in the Waikƒ´kƒ´ neighborhood. There are at least three of these intersections along Kalakaua Avenue at Lewers St, Royal Hawaiian Avenue and Seaside Avenue. On 31 May 2013, Chicago began testing a pedestrian scramble on the intersection of State Street and Jackson Boulevard. It is now permanent. In Nevada, both Reno and Sparks have pedestrian scramble interchanges. Reno's is at the intersection of Virginia and 2nd Avenue downtown to accommodate casino pedestrian traffic, and Sparks' are along Victorian Avenue to assist people in crossing to festivals that are held along that street. Seattle uses the pedestrian scramble at 1st and Pike, 1st and University, 1st and Cherry, Beacon and 15th, 15th Ave NE and NE 40th St, and at the West Seattle Junction. The intersections are marked with a sign labeled \\"All Way Walk.\\" Bellevue, Washington, also has one at 108th Avenue NE and the NE 6th Street pedestrian walkway, on the west side of Bellevue Transit Center. It is not signed as an all-way walk, but has pedestrian walk lights, and is accompanied by an auditory alert of \\"Walk sign is on for all crossings.\\" In California, San Francisco has several pedestrian scrambles along Stockton Street in Chinatown, Montgomery Street in the Financial District, as well as in several other locations. In Los Angeles County, California, pedestrian scrambles are used in the Rodeo Drive commercial area of Beverly Hills; at the intersection of Westwood Boulevard and Le Conte Avenue as well as Weyburn and Broxton Avenues in the Westwood section of Los Angeles immediately adjacent to the UCLA campus; at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in Hollywood, and at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue near the University of Southern California. In 1994, two scrambles were installed in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, along Colorado Boulevard at two intersections: at DeLacey Avenue and at Raymond Avenue. In San Diego, one of the locations that uses pedestrian scrambles is at the intersection of Market Street and 5th Avenue, but the city does not plan to add any additional scrambles. Carlsbad added its first scramble in 2012, and the campus of UC Davis installed a bike/pedestrian scramble near its recreation center in 2014. Pedestrian scramble at the corner of S Flores Street and Dolorosa in San Antonio The City of El Paso, Texas, added pedestrian scramble markings to the intersection of Santa Fe Street and Main Drive in Downtown in April 2015. In Portland, Oregon, a pedestrian scramble was added in November 2015 to the intersection of NW 11th Avenue and NW Couch Street, near Powell's Books. Multiple pedestrian scrambles were added in the downtown area of Broadway in Nashville, Tennessee, in March 2016.  Advantages and disadvantages  Oxford Circus in London with a new pedestrian scramble in November 2009 Research at Transport for London has suggested the installation of a diagonal crossing can reduce pedestrian casualties by 38%. Since it stops all motor vehicles rather than allowing partial vehicle movements to coexist with partial pedestrian movements, the pedestrian scramble has sometimes been seen as inefficient by traffic engineers, with its removal believed to yield big savings in delays and congestion. It benefits drivers by eliminating concurrent pedestrian phases, allowing car traffic to make left or right turns without being blocked by pedestrians in the crosswalk. However, this also results in either longer wait times for both drivers and pedestrians, or shorter traffic-signal phases where less traffic could flow through an intersection in a single cycle. Proper use requires that both drivers and pedestrians are aware of the traffic rules at such intersections. In some countries, that has led to a removal of at least individual installations. However, critics have dismissed these moves as further subordinating pedestrians to cars and consider the shared turns of motor vehicles and pedestrians as unnecessarily intimidating. The pedestrian scramble may be used where large numbers of pedestrians are expected, and they will also have enough space to gather on the sidewalks in larger numbers. Under certain circumstances, pedestrian scrambles could reduce safety, as the average waiting times for pedestrians and car drivers are increased, thus creating more likelihood of people disobeying the signals.

Commissariats were created as central organs of state administration when Soviet power was established in the republics in the territory of the former Russian Empire. The number of People's Commissariats changed in accordance with the requirements of the current moment; basically it was an increase due to the separation of existing and the formation of new ones. First People's Commissariats The first People's Commissariats were created by the \\"Decree on the establishment of the Council of People's Commissars\\"Decree on the establishment of the Council of People's Commissars, adopted by the 2nd Congress of Soviets on November 9, 1917Decree of the 2nd All-Russian Congress of Soviets on the formation of the Workers' and Peasants' Government on November 8, 1917. The decree was established: The All-Russian Congress of Soviets and its executive body, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, had the right to control the activities of the People's Commissars and to remove them. By the same decree the first composition of the Council of People‚Äôs Commissars was formed, including the list of People's Commissariats: *People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Agriculture; *People's Commissariat of Labor; *People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Trade and Industry; *People's Commissariat of Education; *People's Commissariat of Finance; *People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Justice; *People's Commissariat of Food; *People's Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs; *People's Commissariat of National Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Railway Affairs. Later, by a decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of December 15, 1917, the Supreme Council of National Economy under the Council of People's Commissars, which had the status of People's Commissariat, was established to organize and manage the national economyCollection of laws and regulations of the workers' and peasants' government.

People's Commissariats of the Soviet Republics =Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic= With minor changes and additions, the same list of people's commissariats of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is also presented in Article 43 of the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of 1918 adopted by the 5th All-Russian Congress of SovietsThe Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918). Autonomous Republics Article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of 1918 provided for the opportunity for \\"regions differing in special life and national composition\\" to create autonomous regions with the formation of their regional Congresses of Soviets and their executive bodies, that is, the Councils of People's Commissars. Thus, in the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, formed in 1926 as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in 1929 the Constitution was adopted, which reads: =Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic= The Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, adopted in 1919, in article 14 established: However, no list of People's Commissariats was provided in the Constitution. =Relation with the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union= Since the formation of the Soviet Union, the Union republics delegated part of their sovereign powers to the newly formed state, only a part of governance issues remained in their jurisdiction. The Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet UnionTreaty on the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Article 18) defines the list of People's Commissariats, whose leaders were members of the Council of People's Commissars of the Republics: *Supreme Council of National Economy; *People's Commissariat of Agriculture; *People's Commissariat of Food; *People's Commissariat of Finance; *People's Commissariat of Labor; *People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Justice; *People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection; *People's Commissariat of Education; *People's Commissariat of Health; *People's Commissariat of Social Security; *People's Commissariat of National Affairs. The Council of People's Commissars of the Republic with a deliberative vote also included representatives representing those People's Commissariats, whose leadership began to fall within the competence of the Soviet Union: *People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs; *People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade; *People's Commissariat of Communications; *People's Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs. People's Commissariats of the Soviet Union The creation of the Soviet Union was legally formalized by the Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union, which provided for the formation of the government of the union state. It was called the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union; it included the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, his deputies, the leaders of the People's Commissariats of the Soviet Union. The Treaty (Article 11) provides the following list of People's Commissariats of the Soviet Union: *People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs; *People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs; *People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade; *People's Commissariat of Communications; *People's Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs; *People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection; *Supreme Council of National Economy; *People's Commissariat of Labor; *People's Commissariat of Food; *People's Commissariat of Finance. As the national economy developed and strengthened, the number of People's Commissariats at all levels increased.

The southern region, during this time, was much warmer than it is today, ranging from perhaps in the latest Cretaceous Maastrichtian in what is now southeastern Australia. This prevented permanent ice sheets from developing and fostered polar forests, which were largely dominated by conifers, cycads, and ferns, and relied on a temperate climate and heavy rainfall. Major fossil-bearing geological formations that record this area are: the Santa Marta and Sobral Formations of Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula; the Snow Hill Island, Lopez de Bertodano, and the Hidden Lake Formations on James Ross Island also off the Antarctic Peninsula; and the Eumeralla and Wonthaggi Formations in Australia. The South Polar region housed many endemic species, including several relict forms that had gone extinct elsewhere by the Cretaceous. Of the dinosaur assemblage, the most diverse were the small hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs. The South Polar region also was home to the last labyrinthodont amphibian, Koolasuchus. The isolation of Antarctica produced a distinct ecosystem of marine life called the Weddellian Province.  Landscape  = Geology = Dinosaur Cove has moved north over the last hundred million years The Latady Basin in the southern Antarctic Peninsula‚ÄìPalmer Land‚Äìcontains volcanic rock, evidencing a large magmatic event in the Middle Cretaceous referred to as the Palmer Land event. This area has yielded an array of both macro- and micro- plant and mollusk fossils representative of the Early Cretaceous, as well as the Middle to Late Jurassic. The area that is now the Antarctic Peninsula, throughout the Mesozoic, was subducting the proto-Pacific plate, causing volcanic activity. An important fossil-bearing formation is the Santa Marta Formation at James Ross Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most significant formations of the Southern Hemisphere, representing a high diversity terrestrial flora and fauna of the Late Cretaceous polar region. Seymour Island is similar in this respect, the area of discovery for vertebrate and invertebrate creatures‚Äìsuch as plesiosaurs‚Äìof the Late Cretaceous, extending into the Eocene. Other Cretaceous fossil-bearing formations in Antarctica are the Snow Hill Island Formation, the Lopez de Bertodano Formation, and the Hidden Lake Formation, also on James Ross Island. The Eumeralla Formation of Dinosaur Cove and the Wonthaggi Formation in Victoria, Australia, contain a number of dinosaur fossils and tracks from the Early Cretaceous. The Tahora Formation represents the reptile assemblage of Cretaceous New Zealand. The Great Artesian Basin is a remnant of the inland Eromanga Sea The Eromanga Sea was an inland sea across what would be Australia that formed in the Early Cretaceous. The sea reached the Eromanga Basin from the north via the Carpentarian Basin. The southern end of the sea comprised lagoons and rivers, and to the east in Surat Basin a bay. When India drifted away from Australia in the Early Cretaceous, the Perth Basin also filled with seawater. The area that would be the Coral Sea was a rift valley. As Australia and Antarctica drifted apart throughout the Cretaceous, a sea formed in between them. = Vegetation = The Cretaceous is characterized by warm global temperatures caused by the high amounts of carbon dioxide and possibly methane greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This caused a lack of permanent ice coverage in the polar regions, though the carbon dioxide level dropped between 115 and 66 million years ago (mya), possibly allowing some permanent ice cover. It is possible that, throughout the Cretaceous, several small ice sheets developed. Increased tectonic activity, causing more geothermal heat, may have prevented glaciation and increased global temperatures. Temperatures may have been up to 15 ¬∞C (27 ¬∞F) warmer than they are in the modern age. Jurassic The landscape of the Middle Jurassic polar region has been reconstructed from the remains of forests exposed in New Zealand, which were between 70 and 80¬∞S during the Jurassic. The vegetation was largely made up of conifers, cycads, and other gymnosperms, as well as ferns; on the forest floor grew lycopods, bryophytes, fungi, and algae. It had a temperate climate with heavy rainfall. Early Cretaceous In the Early Cretaceous, East Gondwana (Australia, Antarctica and Zealandia) had started to split away from South America, and India and Madagascar also began to separate at around the same time. The tropical zone may have extended, during the Cretaceous, to 32¬∞S, allowing year-round tree growth in the Antarctic in polar forests. The discovery of several mature evergreen and deciduous trees indicate a warm-to-cool temperature with moderate seasons lacking widespread freezing, at least between the latitudes 70 and 85¬∞S. However, it is also possible that the plant life may only be representative of the warm summer months. Much of what is known of the plant life of East Gondwana during the Cretaceous consists of pollen remains and leaf compressions from the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Depending on the latitude, the polar winters may have lasted from six weeks to four and a half months. East Gondwana may have been similar to present day South American temperate forests (above). However, rocks from the Early Cretaceous Wonthaggi Formation in southeastern Australia evidence seasonally frozen ground. Its geographical positioning in the Early Cretaceous at around 78¬∞S indicates this area experienced one to three months of darkness in winters, and this area is representative of a glacial-fed floodplain. Evidence of Early Cretaceous glaciation and cold climates was discovered in sediments in the Eromanga Basin in modern-day central Australia, or 60 to 80¬∞S in the Early Cretaceous. This basin was a large inland sea in the Cretaceous. Nonetheless, similar formations could have been created by simply debris flow, and so it is possible that glaciation did not ever occur there. The total polar ice coverage during the Mesozoic may have been a third of the size as it is in modern times, though cold snaps of subfreezing temperatures possibly occurred throughout the Early Cretaceous. Late Cretaceous The canopy of the polar forests around present-day Alexander Island, which was around 75¬∞S in the Middle Cretaceous, were predominantly evergreen, and likely most South Polar forests were as well, and comprised mainly araucarian and podocarp conifers. It is thought that these trees remained dormant throughout the polar winters until summers under the midnight sun. Evidence of flowering plants dating to around 80 Ma in the Late Cretaceous suggests the existence of temperate forests‚Äìsimilar to those in present-day Australia, New Zealand, and southern South America. Some flower remains were discovered near 60¬∞S, and it is possible at such a low latitude that this area was subject to polar winters and seasonal weather, though the flowers suggest an annual temperature range of and a rainy climate. Pollen remains from southeastern Australia are identical to living plant species of Australia: conifers, flowering plants that inhabit areas with high rainfall and a Mediterranean climate, and sclerophyllous scrublands, indicating a unique landscape of rainforest and open bushland. Indicated by the size of the tree rings on fossil trees, the Antarctic polar forests featured a cooling trend throughout the Maastrichtian age 72 to 66 mya, from a mean annual temperature of to a more seasonally extreme . These plants likely survived the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, which killed off most life 66 Ma, on the volcanic Antarctic Peninsula; plant fossils dating to 60 Ma in the Paleocene from Seymour Island off this peninsula are recognized as being the ancestors of temperate plants inhabiting modern-day Australia and South America. The Late Cretaceous (Campanian) Zamek and Half Three Point Formations of King George Island were located at 60¬∞S and display a rich assemblage of fossil flora, such as Podocarpus; Araucaria; the leptosporangiate ferns Cladophlebis and Clavifera; and a variety of Magnoliopsida flowering plants, Dicotylophyllum, Myrciophyllum santacruzensis, Nothofagus, Sterculiaephyllum australis, Monimiophyllum, and so forth.Zamek Hill assemblage at Fossilworks.orgSkua Bay assemblage at Fossilworks.orgHalf Three Point assemblage at Fossilworks.org The Sobral Formation of Seymour Island spanning the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary at a paleolatitude of 63¬∞S provided a new genus of fossil flower in the family Cunoniaceae, Eucryphiaceoxylon eucryphioides.Sobral Formation at Fossilworks.org  Ecology  Much as in Australia today, East Gondwana played host to many endemic animals, which included many relict species of families that had gone extinct in the rest of the Cretaceous world. It is possible the polar regions of the Late Cretaceous had been inhabited by groups of plants and animals whose ancestry can be traced back to the Ordovician. The gradual isolation of Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous created a distinct group of aquatic creatures called the Weddellian Province. = Dinosaurs =  Birds  Early penguins (Waimanu above) may have existed in the Late Cretaceous. The remains of the ancestor of modern birds, the Neornithes, are uncommon in the Mesozoic, with a large radiation occurring in the Neogene of Antarctica. However, the discovery of the Late Cretaceous Vegavis, a goose-like bird, on Vega Island indicates that the major modern bird groups were already common in the Cretaceous. A femur belonging to an unidentified seriema-like bird was also discovered on Vega Island. Bird footprints were preserved in Dinosaur Cove, and, being larger than most Cretaceous bird species, indicate an abundance of larger enantiornithe or ornithurine birds during the Early Cretaceous. Two diving birds, possible primitive loons, were discovered in Late Cretaceous Chile and Antarctica: Neogaeornis and Polarornis. Polarornis may have been capable of both diving and flight. The earliest penguins, Crossvallia and Waimanu, are known from 61‚Äì62 Ma in the Paleocene, however molecular data suggests penguins first evolved in the Late Cretaceous. Given that these penguins were dated so close to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, the group either evolved before the event or very rapidly afterwards.  Non-avian  Australovenator is the most complete theropod found in Australia. Dinosaur fossils are rare from the South Polar region, and major fossil-bearing locations are the James Ross Island group; Beardmore glacier in Antarctica; Roma, Queensland; Mangahouanga stream in New Zealand; and Dinosaur Cove in Victoria, Australia. The dinosaur remains of this region, such as those found in Victoria, consist only fragmentary pieces, making identification controversial. For example, disputed identifications of an allosaurid which may represent an abelisaurid, the ceratopsian Serendipaceratops which could be an ankylosaur, and the difficult-to-classify theropod Timimus have consequently been made. The supercontinent Pangaea of the Jurassic allowed major dinosaur clades to achieve a global distribution before breaking up, and several closely related cognates existed between South Polar forms and forms found elsewhere despite separation by the Tethys Ocean. However, dinosaur groups that achieved pan-Gondwanan distribution over the course of the Cretaceous would have had to have used the land bridge connecting Australia to South America via Antarctica in the South Polar region. The South Polar iguanodontian Muttaburrasaurus is most closely related to European rhabdodontids, which were the dominant group in Europe during the Late Cretaceous. The Cretaceous South Polar Kunbarrasaurus is identified as being the most basal (primitive) ankylosaur, which is significant as ankylosaurs are known from both Gondwana and Laurasia. The Dromaeosauridae are known from Antarctica, and represent a relict population from a previously world-wide distribution. Despite these apparent cross-continental migrations, it is unlikely that South Polar dinosaurs migrated out of the polar forests during the winter, as they were either too massive‚Äìsuch as ankylosaurs‚Äìor too small‚Äìsuch as troodontids‚Äìto travel long distances, and a large sea between East Gondwana and other continents impeded any such migrations in the Late Cretaceous. It is possible, to cope with the winter conditions, some dinosaurs hibernated, such as the theropod Timimus. Illustration of the hypsilophodont- like Diluvicursor The most common and diverse group found so far are the hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, making up half of the dinosaur taxa found in southeastern Australia, which is unseen in more tropical regions, perhaps indicating some kind of advantage over other dinosaurs in the poles. Being small with grinding dentition, they likely fed on low-lying vegetation such as lycopods and podocarp seed pods. The hypsilophodont-like Leaellynasaura had large eye sockets, larger than more tropical hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, and may have had acute night vision, suggesting that Leaellynasaura, and perhaps other hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, lived in the polar areas for year-round or most of the year, including polar winters. Bonegrowth was continuous throughout its life, indicating it did not hibernate, being possible by perhaps being endothermic or poikilothermic, or by digging burrows. However, it is possible that the large eyes are merely due to ontogenesis, that is, relatively large eye-sockets may have been a feature only seen in juveniles or perhaps was a birth-defect, since there is only one specimen known. Though remains are scant and, consequently, taxonomic descriptions can be dubious, the Victorian theropod remains have been assigned to seven different clades: Ceratosauria, Spinosauria, Tyrannosauroidea, Maniraptora, Ornithomimosauria, and Allosauroidea. However, tyrannosauroids are not known from other Gondwanan continents, and are more known from northern Laurasia. Unlike the other Gondwanan continents whose apex predators where abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids, the discovery of Australovenator, Rapator and an unnamed species in Australia suggests the megaraptorans were the top predators of East Gondwana. The tail vertebrae of an unknown theropod, dubbed \\"Joan Wiffen's theropod\\", were discovered in the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous rocks of New Zealand. Wintonotitan likely inhabited the South Polar region. Three titanosaurs‚ÄìSavannasaurus, Diamantinasaurus, and Wintonotitan‚Äìand one macronarian‚ÄìAustrosaurus‚Äìdiscovered in the Winton Formation make up the sauropod assemblage of Cretaceous Australia, though, these creatures probably avoided the polar regions as their remains are completely absent in Southeast Australia which was within the South Polar region in the Cretaceous. However, it is likely that at least the titanosaurs migrated to Australia from South America, which would have required them to pass through Antarctica, since titanosaurs evolved in the Cretaceous after the break-up of Pangaea. It is possible the Bonarelli Event in the Middle Cretaceous may have made Antarctica warmer and therefore more hospitable to sauropods. These dinosaurs probably fed on the fleshy seeds of podocarp and yew trees, as well as the commonplace forked ferns of the time. Austrosaurus may represent a relict of Middle Jurassic sauropods, being seemingly more primitive than the Cretaceous sauropods; it is unknown why more primitive sauropods outlasted more derived sauropods. It is possible that dinosaurs, after becoming locally extinct at the equator, more preferred the polar regions.  Paleocene  After an asteroid impact, the ensuing impact winter is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs along with much of Mesozoic life in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. However, the lack of an abrupt extinction horizon in Antarctic or Australian sediments for plant and bivalve fossils during this time period indicates a less powerful impact in the South Polar region. Given that the dinosaurs and other fauna of the polar regions of the Cretaceous were well adapted for living in long periods of dark and cold weather, it has been postulated that this community might have survived the event. = Rivers and lakes = The last temnospondyls‚Äìa group of giant amphibians which mainly died out after the Triassic‚Äìinhabited the South Polar region into the Early Cretaceous. Koolasuchus, perhaps the last of the temnospondyls, is thought to have survived in regions where it was too cold for their competitors, the neosuchians‚Äìa group of reptiles containing modern crocodilians‚Äìwhich are inactive in water below , to survive. Though neosuchians are known from Cretaceous Australia, it is thought that they stayed away from the polar region, arriving to Australia over-seas rather than over-land. Isisfordia was a neosuchian that lived in the inland Eromanga Sea of the Early Cretaceous. It is likely the temnospondyls inhabited the freshwater systems of polar Australia until the Bonarelli Event in the Middle Cretaceous around 100 mya increased temperatures and allowed neosuchians to inhabit Antarctica. These neosuchians, at an adult size of no more than in length, likely led to the extinction of the temnospondyls in tandem with more- developed ray-finned fish which perhaps targeted their larvae. The migration of neosuchians into the region suggests that average winter temperatures were greater than , with an average annual temperature of more than . However, polar neosuchians are only known from an almost complete skeleton of Isisfordia, and other neosuchian remains are of undetermined species. Plesiosaurs inhabited freshwater river and estuary systems, given the locations of their remains, probably colonizing Australia in the Early to Middle Jurassic. Their remains, mainly teeth, have been documented from southeastern Australia deriving from the Late Cretaceous, though they were never described as the remains are too sparse to do so. The teeth share some affinity with pliosaurs, notably the rhomaleosaurids and Leptocleidus, which died out in the Early Cretaceous, indicating the polar freshwater systems may have been a refuge for the pliosaurs of the Cretaceous. In contrast to modern marine reptiles, these South Polar plesiosaurs probably had a better tolerance of colder waters. = Oceans = The Australian Woolungasaurus being attacked by a Kronosaurus Early to Middle Cretaceous marine reptile remains of South Australia include five families of plesiosaurs‚ÄìCryptoclididae, Elasmosauridae, Polycotylidae, Rhomaleosauridae, and Pliosauridae‚Äìand the ichthyosaur family Ophthalmosauridae. The discovery of several juvenile plesiosaur remains suggest they used the nutrient-rich waters of the coast as sheltered calving grounds, the cold deterring predators such as sharks. Most of the plesiosaurs discovered had a cosmopolitan distribution, however endemic forms existed there such as Opallionectes and a possible new species of cryptoclidid. A dubious species of elasmosaurid Woolungasaurus, was named in 1928, one of the earliest description of an Australian marine reptile. Several mollusc, gastropod, ammonite, bony fish, chimaerid, and squid-like belemnite remains have been recovered as well. The coastal area may have experienced winter freezing, and these reptiles, in response, may have migrated north during the winter, had a more active metabolism than tropical reptiles, have hibernated in freshwater areas much like the modern day American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), or have been endothermic similar to modern day leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). The lower number of plesiosaurs and higher number of ichthyosaurs and sea turtles in more northerly areas of Australia indicates a preference for colder areas in plesiosaurs. Restoration of the New Zealand Kaiwhekea Several Late Cretaceous oceanic plesiosaurs and mosasaurs have been discovered in New Zealand and Antarctica, with some, such as Mauisaurus, being endemic, while others, such as Prognathodon, having a cosmopolitan distribution. Elasmosaurs and pliosaurs are known from one to three species from this area. The discovery of three cryptoclidids in the Southern Hemisphere‚ÄìMorturneria from Antarctica, Aristonectes from South America, and Kaiwhekea from New Zealand‚Äìindicates a diversification of the family in the Late Cretaceous of this region and perhaps an increasing productivity of the early Southern Ocean. = Pterosaurs = Pterosaurs similar to the Brazilian Anhanguera (above) inhabited the Eromanga Sea region Two clades of pterosaurs are represented in Early Cretaceous Australia, Pteranodontoidea and Ctenochasmatoidea, remains mainly deriving from the Toolebuc Formation and areas of Queensland and New South Wales. It is thought that at least six pterosaur taxa existed in Cretaceous Australia, however, given the fragmentary nature of the remains, many fossils recovered originate from undetermined pterosaur. Fossils were found in shallow-water environments and lagoons, indicating a diet of fish and other aquatic life. The ctenochasmatids were the only archaeopterodactyloids to survive into the Cretaceous. The only pterosaur tooth remains discovered in Australia deriving from the Early Cretaceous belong to Mythunga and a possible Late Cretaceous anhanguerid. Mythunga is estimated to have had a wingspan, much larger than any other archaeopterodactyloid discovered, though it is possible the pterosaur is more related to the Anhangueridae or Ornithocheiridae. However, pterosaur remains existing in what were the non-polar regions of Australia, given their ability to migrate by air, perhaps did not need to cross a land bridge through the polar regions to arrive there, meaning they did not ever inhabit the South Polar region. Of the Late Cretaceous pterosaurs, only the remains belonging to the family Azhdarchidae‚Äìfound in the Carnarvon and Perth basins in Western Australia‚Äìwere assigned to a taxon. A possible representative of Ornithocheiridae was found in Late Cretaceous Western Australia, though the family was previously thought to have gone extinct in the Early Cretaceous. = Mammals = Restoration of Steropodon Seven mammals have been discovered from Early Cretaceous Australia: an undescribed ornithorhynchid, Kryoryctes, Kollikodon, Ausktribosphenos, Bishops, Steropodon, and Corriebaatar; all of which were endemic to Australia during this time. It is likely mammals crossed the Antarctic land bridge between Australia and South America in the Early Cretaceous, and likely the ancestors of the endemic mammals of Australia arrived during the Jurassic across the supercontinent Pangaea. = Invertebrates = Several fossils of insects and crustaceans are known from South Polar Cretaceous sediments of New Zealand. The Late Cretaceous Mangaotanean Monro Conglomerate was situated at 68¬∞S and provided fossils of Helastia sp.,Monro Conglomerate at Fossilworks.org and the crab Hemioon novozelandicum was found in the Swale Siltstone, located at 76¬∞S during the late Albian.Swale Stream at Fossilworks.org Several specimens of insects were also found in the Tupuangi Formation of the Chatham Islands at a latitude of 79¬∞S during the Cenomanian to Turonian.Waihere Bay, Pitt Island at Fossilworks.org  See also  * Dinosaur Cove * Dinosaur Dreaming * Geology of Antarctica, including paleontology ** List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Antarctica * List of Australian and Antarctic dinosaurs * Gondwana Rainforests * Polar forests of the Cretaceous  References   Further reading    * *  External links  * Dinosaur trackways in Western Australia * Polar dinosaurs in Australia * Dinosaur Dreaming Web site * Dinosaur Dreaming in Action * Monash Science Centre * Overview of Australian dinosaurs Category:Cretaceous paleogeography Category:Cretaceous Antarctica Category:Dinosaurs of Antarctica Category:Cretaceous Australia Category:Dinosaurs of Australia ","title":"South Polar region of the Cretaceous"},{"id":"1156929","text":"Mumra may refer to: * Mumra, Nepal * Mumra, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia * Mumm-Ra (band), an English indie rock band originally from Bexhill-on-Sea * Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living, a character in the Thundercats TV series ","title":"Mumra"},{"id":"1156934","text":"Ammonium carbonate is a salt with the chemical formula (NH4)2CO3. Since it readily degrades to gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide upon heating, it is used as a leavening agent and also as smelling salt. It is also known as baker's ammonia and was a predecessor to the more modern leavening agents baking soda and baking powder. It is a component of what was formerly known as sal volatile and salt of hartshorn, and produces a pungent smell when baked. Production Ammonium carbonate is produced by combining carbon dioxide and aqueous ammonia. About 80,000 tons/year were produced as of 1997. =Decomposition= Ammonium carbonate slowly decomposes at standard temperature and pressure through two pathways. Thus any initially pure sample of ammonium carbonate will soon become a mixture including various byproducts. Ammonium carbonate can spontaneously decompose into ammonium bicarbonate and ammonia: : (NH4)2CO3 ‚Üí NH4HCO3 \\\\+ NH3 Which further decompose to carbon dioxide, water and another molecule of ammonia: : NH4HCO3 ‚Üí H2O + CO2 \\\\+ NH3  Uses  =Leavening agent= Ammonium carbonate may be used as a leavening agent in traditional recipes, particularly those from northern Europe and Scandinavia (e.g. Speculoos, Tunnbr√∂d or Lebkuchen). It was the precursor to today's more commonly used baking powder. Originally made from ground deer horn and called hartshorn, today it is called baker's ammonia. It is prepared by the sublimation of a mixture of ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate and occurs as a white powder or a hard, white or translucent mass. It acts as a heat activated leavening agent and breaks down into carbon dioxide (leavening), ammonia (which needs to dissipate) and water. It is sometimes combined with sodium bicarbonate to mimic as a double acting baking powder and to help mask any ammonia smell not baked out. It also serves as an acidity regulator and has the E number E503. It can be replaced with baking powder, but this may affect both the taste and texture of the finished product. Baker's ammonia should be used to create thin dry baked goods like crackers and cookies. This allows the strong ammonia smell to bake out. It should not be used to make moist baked items like cake since ammonia is hydrophilic and will leave a strong bitter taste. Its use as a leavening agent, with associated controversy, goes back centuries: =Other uses= Ammonium carbonate is the main component of smelling salts, although the commercial scale of their production is small. Buckley's cough syrup from Canada today uses ammonium carbonate as an active ingredient intended to help relieve symptoms of bronchitis. It is also used as an emetic. It is also found in smokeless tobacco products, such as Skoal, and it is used in aqueous solution as a photographic lens cleaning agent, such as Eastman Kodak's \\"Kodak Lens Cleaner.\\" It is also used for luring of apple maggots in Washington State, to monitor the spread of the infestation and adjust the borders of the Apple Maggot Quarantine Area.

Its local government area is the City of Frankston. At the , Seaford had a population of 16,463. History Seaford was the site of the Karrum Karrum swamp, which was utilised for food by the Bunurong Aboriginal people. In the early twentieth century, after European settlement, the swamp was drained for farming purposes (with wet areas remaining only at low lands; including Seaford and the Edithvale wetlands). The name Seaford arose during a meeting of local residents in 1913, called to decide upon a name for the settlement and the new railway station about to open. It was agreed that the name should contain some reference to the sea. Councillor Sydney Plowman suggested \\"Seaford\\", dropping the \\"l\\" from his home town of Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, England. The suggestion was adopted. The Seaford Post Office opened on 6 March 1914. During the 1950s and 1960s, the suburb grew as a result of affordability, and proximity to the beach and Frankston. In 1985 a report was produced titled Ecology and Management of Seaford Swamp, recommending the creation of lagoons, substantial tree plantations and improvement of public facilities. These initiatives were implemented by the City of Frankston and Melbourne Water, using funds from the Melbourne Parks and Waterways Grants Program. Sport, recreation and public facilities Seaford is home to several public park spaces including three with barbecue facilities and playground equipment. Seaford Scout Group, one of the earliest Australian chapters, merged with Carrum to form the Seaford Carrum Scout Group. Seaford is home to Seaford United Soccer Club competing in Men's State League 2 of the Victorian Football Federation and the Seaford Australian Football Club competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League, both using the 'Tigers' nickname. The suburb is also home to two cricket clubs, the Seaford Cricket Club (Est. 1924) and also, the Seaford Tigers Cricket Club (Est. 1990) who compete in the Mornington Peninsula Cricket Association. Southern Districts Rugby Club has its base in the north of the suburb. In February 2011 the Australian Football League's St Kilda Football Club officially opened its $10.25 million training venue at Belvedere Park in Seaford. =Seaford Foreshore Reserve= thumb The Seaford Foreshore Reserve is one of the few remaining substantial, continuous strands of natural coastal vegetation near Melbourne. Seaford is notable for this reserve, which divides the beach from Nepean Highway along the whole length of the suburb. This reserve was the site for an extensive dune restoration program undertaken by the Port Phillip Authority in 1972, under the title of the \\"Seaford Experimental Project\\". The program involved extensive areas of fencing, revegetation and the installation of walking tracks, seats, tables and shelters. =Keast Park= Keast Park is a 2.5 hectare public park situated at the northern end of the Seaford foreshore on Port Phillip Bay. The master plan for the park was designed in 2004, the project explored ways to protect the ecology of the sensitive foreshore environment with the functional requirements of the public park. The park serves a broad range of functions, including the Carrum Bowls Club, the sea scouts, public toilets and change facilities, a multi-purpose community space and a small caf√©.http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/keast-park =Seaford Wetlands= Seaford Wetlands is a 305 hectare nature reserve listed on the Register of the National Estate. The wetlands are home to a wide variety of bird life, including a number of rare and endangered migratory species protected by international agreements. The large numbers and variety of bird life make the Wetlands popular with bird watchers. Many migratory birds from as far afield as Siberia visit the reserve from October to March. There are stands of river red gums around the margins of the Wetlands, some of which are estimated to be around 300 years old. Some have scars where the bark was stripped for use by the Bunurong Aboriginal people prior to European settlement. The swamp is noted for its prolific and various bird life. Around 130 different species have been observed there in recent years. The more common species are wetland- dependent birds which occur in southern Victoria, such as ducks, swans, rails and pelicans. A number of rare migratory bird species also visit the wetlands between October and March. These come from Northern Asia and are protected by treaties between the Australian Government and the Governments of Japan and China. Many birds can easily be seen from the vantage points overlooking the wetland's lagoons. Others are more difficult to spot because they prefer the protection of the reed beds. The wetlands support a small variety of native animals consisting of swamp rat, water rat, snakes and frogs. Three types of fish can also be found in the wetlands: common galaxias, short-finned eels and mosquitofish (an exotic pest species). =Kananook walking trail= A popular walking trail, split by roads, passes by the Seaford RSL, continuing in both directions. =Kananook Creek= The Kananook Creek runs from northern Seaford where it is fed by the Eel Race Drain and flows southwards through Seaford roughly adjacent to the Nepean Highway through to Frankston where it flows into Port Phillip. Schools There are six primary schools in Seaford, Kananook Primary School, Belvedere Park Primary School, Seaford Primary School, Seaford North Primary School, Seaford Park Primary School and St Anne's Catholic Primary School. And Seaford is also home to a secondary school as well, Patterson River Secondary School is located in the north of the suburb. Public transport Seaford is serviced by both Bus and Commuter rail. Two railway stations are within the suburb ‚Äì Seaford and Kananook ‚Äì on the Frankston railway line. Both are in Zone 2. Sarah MacDiarmid disappeared from Kananook Station on 11 July 1990, last seen walking from the station to the carpark. State Politics Since the state election on 29 November 2014, The suburb of Seaford has been represented by Labor MP Sonya Kilkenny in Victoria's Legislative Assembly.

The system includes the United States' largest port complex; an extensive freight and passenger rail infrastructure, including light rail lines and rapid transit lines; numerous airports and bus lines; vehicle for hire companies; and an extensive freeway and road system. People in Los Angeles rely on cars as the dominant mode of transportation, but since 1990 Los Angeles Metro Rail has built over of light and heavy rail serving more and more parts of Los Angeles. Intercity =Air transportation= LAX, the fourth busiest airport in the world. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, there are five commercial airports and many more general-aviation airports. The primary Los Angeles airport is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The seventh busiest commercial airport in the world and the third busiest in the United States, LAX handled 61.9 million passengers, of cargo and 680,954 aircraft movements in 2007. Other major nearby commercial airports include: LA/Ontario International Airport (serves the Inland Empire); Bob Hope Airport (formerly known as Burbank Airport; serves the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys); Long Beach Airport (serves the Long Beach/Harbor area); and John Wayne Airport (serves the Orange County area). The world's busiest general-aviation airport is also located in Los Angeles, Van Nuys Airport. Santa Monica Airport is also located near Los Angeles. =Intercity train services= Major freight rail lines in southern Los Angeles County, including the Alameda Corridor highlighted in pink Union Station is the major regional train station for Amtrak, Metrolink and Metro Rail. The station is Amtrak's fifth busiest station, having 1,464,289 Amtrak boardings and de-boardings in 2006.Amtrak National Facts . Accessed July 2, 2008 Amtrak operates eleven daily round trips between San Diego and Los Angeles, five of which continue to Santa Barbara via the Pacific Surfliner, the only service that runs through Los Angeles multiple times daily. Two of those trips continue to San Luis Obispo, California. The Coast Starlight provides additional service on the route and beyond to the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, and on to Seattle, Washington. Amtrak motor coaches connect from Los Angeles to the San Joaquin Route in Bakersfield with frequent service through the Central Valley of California to Sacramento and Oakland, and eastward to San Bernardino and Las Vegas. There is also daily service to Chicago, Illinois on the Southwest Chief, and three times a week to New Orleans, Louisiana on the Sunset Limited. Due to the effects from Hurricane Katrina, Sunset Limited service between New Orleans to Jacksonville, Florida has been discontinued, although Amtrak is required by current Federal Law to develop a plan to reinstate the service. The Texas Eagle is a second train to Chicago, which operates thrice weekly. Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle trains operate on the same track between Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas before splitting off towards their respective destinations. Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains stop at several locations in Los Angeles County, including: Glendale, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Chatsworth, and Van Nuys. Due to the large volumes of import freight that flows into the city's port complex, Los Angeles is a major freight railroad hub. Freight is hauled by Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway. The now-defunct Southern Pacific Railroad once served the Los Angeles area before merging with Union Pacific. The Alameda Corridor, a below-grade rail corridor connects the port to the city's main rail yards and to points further north and east. =Intercity highways= The major highway routes providing intercity connections are Interstate 5 (which goes north to Sacramento and south to San Diego), U.S. Route 101 (which goes north to Santa Barbara and San Francisco), and Interstate 10 (which goes west to Santa Monica and east to Phoenix, Arizona). =Intercity Bus Services= Greyhound, Megabus and various smaller bus lines provide intercity bus services. Megabus departs from Union Station and directly connects Los Angeles to San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas. Greyhound connects directly to Bakersfield and from there into the California Central Valley, San Diego, Las Vegas, and the San Francisco Bay area. It departs from Los Angeles at its main station located in southeast downtown Los Angeles and from a secondary terminal located in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles. =Harbors= A view of the Vincent Thomas Bridge reaching Terminal Island. The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately south of Downtown. Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT L.A., the port complex occupies of land and water along of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach. The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles‚ÄìLong Beach Harbor. There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along L.A.'s coastline. Most of these like Redondo Beach and Marina del Rey are used primarily by sailboats and yachts. The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach comprise the largest seaport complex in the United States and the fifth busiest in the world. Over 11 percent of United States international trade (by value) passes through the Los Angeles region, and the Los Angeles customs district collects over 37 percent of the nation‚Äôs import duties. The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Gerald Desmond Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. =Ferry services= There are ferries serving the offshore island community of Avalon, California; they are mainly used for day excursions and to move supplies to Catalina Island. There is no regular vehicle ferry service to Avalon, since the city restricts the use of cars and trucks within its borders. Intracity Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles A traffic jam on the Santa Monica Freeway, near the Robertson Boulevard exit The Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, connecting the Century Freeway (I-105) and the Harbor Freeway (I-110). = Freeways = There are a dozen major freeways that crisscross the region. California's first freeway was the Arroyo Seco Parkway segment of California State Route 110, also known as the Pasadena Freeway. It opened on January 1, 1940 and links downtown Los Angeles to downtown Pasadena. From Chavez Ravine north to Pasadena it can be quite dangerous because there is no shoulder, the lanes are narrow, the turns are sharp (not always properly banked), and the ramps are quite short and offer little room for acceleration to freeway speed; all of this is because the freeway was designed for much slower cars and much less traffic volume than exists today. Commercial vehicles over are prohibited from using this freeway. Newer freeways are straighter, wider, and allow for higher speeds. Major freeways in Los Angeles include: *22px Glendale Freeway *22px 22px Santa Ana Freeway *22px Golden State Freeway *22px Santa Monica Freeway/San Bernardino Freeway *22px Antelope Valley Freeway *22px 22px Seaside Freeway *22px Pomona Freeway *22px Marina Freeway *22px Gardena Freeway *22px 22px Hollywood Freeway *22px 22px Ventura Freeway *22px Terminal Island Freeway *22px Glenn M. Anderson Freeway/Century Freeway *22px 22px Harbor Freeway *22px Arroyo Seco Parkway *22px Ronald Reagan Freeway *22px Foothill Freeway *22px San Diego Freeway *22px Long Beach Freeway Major highways in Los Angeles include: *22px Pacific Coast Highway/Lincoln Boulevard *22px Santa Monica Boulevard *22px Decker Canyon Road *22px Topanga Canyon Boulevard *22px Alameda Street *22px Slauson Avenue *22px Highland Avenue *22px Venice Boulevard Angelenos are noted for referring to freeways with the definite article (\\"The 101\\"), in contrast to most other areas of the United States, who omit the article. Referring to freeways by name, for example \\"The San Diego Freeway\\", is essentially a holdover from the time when the freeways were built, and is diminishing. Nevertheless, freeways continue to be officially named; for example, State Route 118 was christened the Ronald Reagan Freeway. = Rush hour = Rush hour occurs on weekdays between 5 am and 10 am, and in the afternoon between 3 pm and 7 pm (although rush-hour traffic can occasionally spill out to 11 am and start again from 2 pm until as late as 10 pm, especially on Fridays). Traffic can occur at almost any time, particularly before major holidays (including Thanksgiving, Christmas, and three-day weekends) and even on regular weekends when one otherwise would not expect it. Experienced Angelenos recognize the need to factor traffic into their commute. Despite the congestion in the city, the mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles' mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, DC. Los Angeles has synchronized its traffic lights. =Streets, street layout, the boulevards, and street problems= The city has an extensive street grid. Arterial streets (referred to as surface streets by locals, in contrast with freeways which are usually grade-separated roadways) connect freeways with smaller neighborhood streets, and are often used to bypass congested freeway routes. Consequently, most of the surface arterial streets in Los Angeles have various forms of congestion control. Some of the more common means of maintaining surface street traffic flow is the use of loop-sensors embedded in the pavement allowing for intersection traffic signal timing adjustments to favor the more heavily delayed roadways; the use of a traffic control system allows for the synchronization of traffic signals to improve traffic flow (as of October 2009 this system is currently installed at 85% of the city's signalized intersections, more than any other US city); restrictions on vehicle turns on roadways without designated turning lanes during rush-hours; and the extensive use of rush-hour parking restrictions, allowing for an extra lane of travel in each direction during peak hours (weekdays excluding holidays generally from 7-9am thru 4-7pm, although hours vary by location) by eliminating on street parking and standing of vehicles, with violators being ticketed, and in the case of priority routes known as \\"anti-gridlock zones\\", immediately towed by specialized enforcement teams dubbed \\"tiger teams\\" at steep cost to the violator. 1st Street divides the block numbering grid north and south, and southwest of the Los Angeles River, Main Street divides the city east and west. Northeast of the river, block designations are divided east and west by Pasadena Avenue and North Figueroa Street. From downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, in a straight-down vertical pattern, east-west streets are numbered (starting with 1st Street in downtown, to 266th Street in Harbor City), and north-south streets are named. (1st Street is one block south of Temple.) There are many exceptions to the numbered streets, but the above pattern is generally used. This same numbered pattern is not mirrored north of Temple. Addresses are then numbered east or west stemming from Main Street (a major north south artery). Therefore, the landmark Watts Towers at 1765 E. 107th Street is approximately 107 streets south of 1st Street, and on the 17th street east of Main Street. Although the numbered streets are sequential, they do not necessarily equal the number of blocks south of 1st Street, as there are streets such as 118th Street and then 118th Place. Many of the numbered streets also continue into neighboring cities, but some cities, such as Manhattan Beach, have made their own numbered street grid. Also, some districts of Los Angeles, such as Wilmington, San Pedro, Venice, and Playa Del Rey have their own numbered street grids. Many arterials have been labeled as boulevards, and many of those mentioned below have been immortalized in movies, music, and literature. Major east-west routes include: Roscoe, Victory, Ventura, Hollywood, Sunset, Santa Monica, Beverly, Wilshire, Olympic, Pico, Venice, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Exposition, Obama Boulevard, and Martin Luther King Jr, and Century Boulevard. The major north-south routes include: Topanga Canyon, Crenshaw, Reseda, Lincoln, Sepulveda, Van Nuys, Westwood, Beverly Glen, San Vicente, Robertson, La Cienega, Laurel Canyon, Glendale, Avalon Boulevard, and Main Street. There are many other famous L.A. streets which carry significant traffic but are not labeled as boulevards. Examples include: Broadway, Bundy Drive, Barrington Avenue, Centinela Avenue, Fountain Avenue, Mulholland Drive, Slauson Avenue, Pacific Coast Highway, Century Park East, Avenue of the Stars, Century Park West, Normandie Avenue, Highland Avenue, Melrose Avenue, Florence Avenue, Manchester Avenue, Vermont Avenue, La Brea Avenue, Fairfax Avenue, Western Avenue, Van Ness Avenue, Figueroa Street, Grand Avenue, Huntington Drive, Central Avenue, Alameda Street, and Imperial Highway. West Los Angeles has many streets named after states that run east and west. Somewhat confusingly, adjacent Santa Monica uses a few of the same state names for different streets of its own. Potholes are a notorious problem in Los Angeles and frequently cause severe damage to all kinds of vehicles. In 2008, then-mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made \\"Operation Pothole\\" one of his top priorities for that year and pledged to fill 1 million potholes.Melissa MacBride, \\"Pothole milestone: Mayor repairs 800,000,\\" ABC7 Eyewitness News, 17 March 2008. However, due to the city's poorly managed budget, the city's Bureau of Street Services has only a single dedicated pothole-repair truck to cover of streets (meaning that the backlog is still bad and getting worse).Steven Leigh Morris, \\"L.A. Metro Buses Hammered By Potholes on Aging Wilshire Boulevard,\\" LA Weekly, 5 September 2008. Many city streets, such as Wilshire Boulevard, were engineered when cars, trucks, and buses were much smaller, and desperately need to be torn up and rebuilt from scratch to handle the weight of today's larger vehicles. Furthermore, due to its severe budget problems, Los Angeles is one of the few California cities that does not use raised pavement markers on its streets. Thus, Los Angeles drivers must be vigilant not only for potholes, but for other drivers drifting out of lanes due to the lack of tactile feedback normally provided by such markers. = On foot = Pedestrians walking on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica Despite the assertion of a popular song that \\"nobody walks in L.A.\\",\\"You won't see a cop walkin' on the beat / You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street / You won't see a kid walkin' home from school / Their mothers pick 'em up in a car pool / Nobody's walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin--nobody walks in LA\\" Missing Persons, \\"Walking in LA\\" 3.5% of Los Angeles residents commuted to work by walking in 2016 and Los Angeles residents walk for exercise at rates similar to those of other major U.S. cities.CDC Walking for Exercise Prevalence Statistics 2000 There are a number of commercial areas in nearby cities that have been redeveloped in the past two decades specifically to accommodate pedestrian traffic. Old Town Pasadena was redeveloped in the late 1980s by moving parking off Colorado Boulevard so as to make the street pedestrian-focused. Likewise, the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica was closed off to vehicular traffic altogether in 1965 and revitalized with improved pedestrian amenities in 1988.History of Third Street Promenade Downtown Los Angeles has numerous public escalators and skyways, such as the Bunker Hill steps to facilitate pedestrian traffic in the traffic-laden and hilly terrain. Downtown Los Angeles is one of two neighborhoods in Los Angeles ranked as a \\"walker's paradise\\" (with walk scores 90 or above) by Walkscore. The other is Mid-City West, which encompasses the area of the city immediately south of West Hollywood and east of Beverly Hills. Nevertheless, much of Los Angeles remains pedestrian unfriendly. A large percentage of sidewalks in the City of Los Angeles (43% or of the ) are in ill repair stemming from the City Council decision in 1973 to use the federal money they had to take over the responsibility from the adjacent property owners. Previously they had conformed to California law which puts the responsibility for repair of sidewalks on the property owners. As certain popular species of trees accelerated the damage caused by roots, the council failed to concurrently allocate funds for continuing city repairs of such sidewalks. Voters were unwilling to approve funding repairs with a tax or a bond measure. The city again began dedicating funds for sidewalk repairs in 2000 but defunded the program during the 2008 financial crisis.Zahniser, David (February 21, 2008) \\"City to pass the bucks on sidewalks?\\" Los Angeles Times In 2015, the city agreed to a landmark legal settlement that would fix the backlog of broken sidewalks and make other improvements to help those with disabilities navigate the city. The biggest agreement of its kind in U.S. history would settle a lawsuit on behalf of people in wheelchairs or others with mobility impairments who argued that crumbling, impassable sidewalks and other barriers were a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act since they were prevented from accessing public pathways. = Bicycle travel = Bicycling accounts for approximately 1% of Los Angeles commuting and has almost doubled in the last ten years. People in Los Angeles commute to work by bicycle about twice as frequently as the US average There are extended stretches of bicycle paths such as the Los Angeles River bicycle path, which runs from Burbank to Long Beach, with only a brief hiatus through downtown. = Mass transit = Foothill Transit Silver Streak bus in front of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles The primary regional public transportation agency is the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), commonly referred to as Metro or MTA. The agency, which operates bus, light rail and subway services, averages 1.2 million transit trips per weekday, making it the third largest transit agency in the United States. Other municipal transportation agencies in Los Angeles County (LADOT, Long Beach Transit, Montebello Bus Lines, Norwalk Transit, Redondo Beach, Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus, Santa Clarita Transit, Torrance Transit and Foothill Transit) have an additional 405,000 average weekday boardings. In February 2008, LACMTA introduced a new universal fare system called 'TAP' which stands for Transit Access Pass. The TAP smart card allows bus and rail passengers to tap their cards on the farebox for faster boarding. TAP readers are installed on bus fareboxes and on turnstiles and standalone validators at rail stations. Because not all Metro Rail stations have turnstiles, it operates on a proof- of-payment system: as such, Metro's fare inspectors randomly check to make sure TAP users have validated their card by using a wireless handheld unit. TAP is now accepted on a number of different transit systems in Los Angeles County. Buses The extensive bus system operated by LACMTA includes the Metro Local, Metro Rapid, and formerly Metro Express services. Local buses tend to be orange, rapid buses red, and express buses blue. Rapid bus route numbers usually begin with a 7 and express bus numbers begin with 4 and 5. The buses have an estimated 1.3 million boardings on the weekdays. Including other municipal bus operators, Los Angeles County averages 1.7 million bus boardings per weekday, accounting for approximately 5.9% of the 29 million daily trips originating in Los Angeles County. LACMTA has two bus rapid transit lines: the G Line and the J Line. The G Line runs from Warner Center/Woodland Hills to the North Hollywood B Line station, began operations on October 29, 2005 as the Orange Line. For 13 of its stretch (21 km of its 22.5 km stretch), the articulated buses, built by North American Bus Industries and dubbed Metro Liners, operate on bus-only lanes that follow an old railroad right-of-way. Portions of the route parallel Chandler and Victory Boulevards, and Oxnard Street. The J Line travels along Interstate 10 and Interstate 110 between El Monte Station and the Harbor Gateway Transit Center. Foothill Transit also operates a bus rapid transit system called the Silver Streak, which runs from Montclair to Downtown Los Angeles along the El Monte Busway on Interstate 10. Other bus systems: * Culver CityBus - green (local) and grey (rapid) * Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus * Montebello Bus Lines * Numerous other municipal bus systems Metro Rail Map of Metro rail, subway, and BRT systems. Map of Westside Metro rail system including lines under construction (Exposition line in Aqua has been completed) Between its light rail and heavy rail systems, Metro Rail has of rail, averaging 308,653 trips per weekday, and accounting for approximately 1.1% of the 29 million daily trips originating in Los Angeles County. The network includes four above-ground light rail lines (L Line, E Line, A Line, and C Line) and one underground subway with two branches (B Line and D Line). Ranked by daily ridership, the Los Angeles subway ranked as the ninth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States. Ranked by passengers per route mile, however, the system ranks sixth, transporting 8,846 passengers per route mile, more than San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit or the Chicago 'L'. The Los Angeles Metro Rail system connects disperse areas of the county including Long Beach, Pasadena, Norwalk, El Segundo, North Hollywood, and Downtown Los Angeles. The Expo Line's first phase from Downtown Los Angeles to Culver City opened April 28, 2012. In June 2010, construction extending the Gold Line from Pasadena to Azusa began. There are several additional rail expansion projects currently under study. The timing of their construction will depend on the availability of funding. These projects include: * Crenshaw/LAX Line, that will run through the Crenshaw district and City of Inglewood to LAX (now under construction) * Connection of the C Line and Crenshaw/LAX Line to LAX through a people mover. *Regional Connector in Downtown Los Angeles, connecting the A, E, and L lines (now under construction). * Further extensions of the L Line from Azusa to Pomona and East Los Angeles to Whittier * Westward extension of the Purple Line subway to Westwood, UCLA and possible connection to the Red Line through West Hollywood and Beverly Hills (now under construction). Commuter rail Also serving Los Angeles and several surrounding counties is Metrolink, a regional commuter rail service. Metrolink averages 42,600 trips per weekday, the busiest line being the San Bernardino line. Los Angeles public transportation statistics The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Los Angeles, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 86 minutes. 31% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 minutes, while 38% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 30% travel for over in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. =Vehicle for hire companies= Vehicle for hire companies face numerous regulations in California. Taxis in Los Angeles are regulated by the Board of Taxicab Commissioners. There are 9 taxi companies in Los Angeles that operate more than 2,300 taxis. Some of the largest Taxi companies in Los Angeles are LA Yellow Cab, Bell Cab, and United Independent Taxi. RideYellow, Curb and Flywheel are three of the most popular mobile apps providing taxi service in Los Angeles. Uber and Lyft operate in Los Angeles. Commuting frameless In 2006, of the 4,423,725 workers aged 16 or older in Los Angeles County, 72.0% commuted to work driving alone, 11.9% commuted by driving in a carpool and 7.0% commuted on public transportation. 64.9% of public transportation commuters were non-white, 70.2% were Hispanic and 67.6% were foreign born. 75.5% of public transportation commuters earned less than $25,000. However, only 32.7% of public transportation commuters had no vehicle available to them for their commute. In the same year, for the City of Los Angeles, of the 1,721,778 workers aged 16 or older, 63.3% commuted to work driving alone, 11.5% commuted by driving in a carpool, 11.0% commuted by public transportation, and 3.4% walked. The percentage of population using public transport in Los Angeles is lower than other large U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York, but similar to or higher than other western U.S. cities such as Portland and Denver. 63.8% of public transportation commuters in the City of Los Angeles in 2006 were non-white, 75.1% were Hispanic and 73.9% were foreign born. 79.4% of public transportation commuters earned less than $25,000 and 37.6% had no vehicle available to them for their commute. Since 2006, driving alone increased at the expense of carpooling and public transportation. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 69.7% of working Los Angeles (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 8.7% carpooled, 9.2% used public transportation, and 3.5% walked. About 2.8% commuted by all other means, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 6.1% worked at home. Problems = Accidents = A traffic accident happens when a vehicle crashes due to malfunction, driver error, faulty road design, weather conditions, or a combination of these factors. The vehicle and its owner involved in a traffic accident usually collide with other vehicles, people, animals or stationary obstacles which can result in property damage, injuries, and even death. The majority of accidents are caused by human errors. In the U.S., traffic accidents caused 32,700 fatalities in 2013, and driver errors are responsible for 90% of the crashes. In that same year, the World Health Organization estimated the annual fatalities worldwide due to car accident to be as many as 1.24 million. =Air quality= Los Angeles is strongly predisposed to accumulation of smog, because of peculiarities of its geography and weather patterns. The millions of vehicles in the area combined with the additional effects of the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex frequently contribute to further air pollution. Los Angeles was one of the best known cities suffering from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that Los Angeles was a synonym for smog. In particular, the entire area in between Los Angeles Harbor and Riverside has become known as the \\"Diesel Death Zone\\". =Americans with Disabilities Act= The city has about of sidewalk. Many are perilous or impassable due to lack of maintenance to those who have disabilities that affect their mobility. In 2015, the city committed to spending $1.4 billion over the next 30 years to resolved a class-action lawsuit citing violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act by fixing other barriers to full and safe access to city streets. = Congestion = Traffic congestion happens due to high roadway demand, where the number of automobiles that try to pass through a road section exceeds the road‚Äôs capacity, causing a slowdown in traffic flow. Traffic congestion can also be a result of poor transportation infrastructure, road construction or traffic accidents. Traffic congestion negatively affects society‚Äôs productivity. Traffic congestions cost EU 1% of its GDP, whereas an Urban Mobility report revealed that the U.S. lost 160 million dollars due to delay and fuel costs in 2014. =First/Last Mile= In the modern transportation sector, the last mile refers to the way in which people get from the high capacity transportation hubs to their final destinations such as their home or workplace. This last mile can be a problem for commuters because public transportation systems do not take them to their exact destination; from the transportation hub, people usually have to walk to their destination for the ‚Äúlast mile,‚Äù which can be time consuming and inconvenient.Stigo, \\"The Last Mile - the term, the problem and the odd solutions\\", medium.com, 04-Oct-2017 This logic also applies to the first mile problem, since from the starting point of travel, people have to walk equal distance as the last mile to get to the nearest transportation hub. To avoid walking, urban dwellers may find owning a car a remedy to this problem; however, if everyone drives to his or her destination instead of taking public transportation, the congestion in an urban area can become worse and the benefit of the public transportation infrastructure is lost.

It was released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends. Nintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \\"sit\\" or \\"roll over\\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time. Nintendogs received critical acclaim, and won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it the highest selling game on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, in front of New Super Mario Bros. Because of Nintendogs success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys and a series of Nintendogs trading cards. A sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011. Gameplay Using the touchscreen, the owner can play with, train, pet, walk, brush, and wash a virtual dog. With the microphone that is built into the DS, the player can create voice commands which the puppy will understand and, if properly trained, follow. Dogs can be walked to the park where they can practice their disc catching skills, and to the gymnasium to practice dog agility. The game features two brands of currency: money and \\"trainer points\\". Money is used to purchase items, whilst trainer points grow or shrink depending on the actions of the player. As points accumulate, more dogs become available for the player to adopt, as well as various cosmetic items that can be purchased to decorate the player's in-game house. By walking their dog, players earn trainer points; the number of points varies depending on the length of the walk, and activities participated in on the way, such as contest training. While walking, question mark icons on the map point out areas that may contain neighborhood dogs or presents, though presents can be found unmarked as well. The player's dog will usually bark once when encountering a \\"?\\" mark icon that is a present, and usually bark twice if it is a neighborhood dog. When encountering another dog and one's trainer, the player's dog may fight or play with the other. Only three dogs may be kept at the player's in-game dwelling at one time, and five dogs may be stored at the \\"Dog Hotel\\". The dogs may also be swapped, dropped off, and picked up at any time. The player may not have any more than eight dogs at a time, but dogs may be donated to make space for more pets. The dog can be cared for by being fed with different types of food and groomed with varying items. As time passes without the dog being cared for, its condition will slowly deteriorate, as it becomes more hungry and dirty. The condition of the player's puppies can be found by clicking the dogs' name. Hunger is listed as Full, Normal, Hungry, and Famished. Thirst is listed as Quenched, Normal, Thirsty, and Parched. The condition of the dog's coat is listed as Beautiful, Clean, Normal, Dirty, and Filthy. If its condition is neglected for long enough then the dog may run away, eventually to return, sometimes with a present. Dogs do not age, meaning they remain as puppies. Nintendogs features a variety of contests, which are the player's main method of earning money and trainer points. There are three contests: Disc Competition, Agility Trial, and Obedience Trial. In each of them, there are 5 classes: Beginner, Open, Expert, Master, and Championship. Each contest is commented on by two men, named Ted Rumsworth and Archie Hubbs. (It was said that Archie sometimes eats dog treats. ) If the player's dog places 3rd or higher in its class, the dog will proceed to the next class, where the contest increases in difficulty level. Prize money earned differs depending on which contest has been entered, what place is finished, and the class the dog is in. If the player does not place at least 3rd, they will be dropped to the previous difficulty level, unless they were in the Beginner class, at which point they will remain there. Dogs that are especially dirty or hungry are not able to participate in contests. Nintendogs supports a link-up method through the Nintendo DS's built-in wireless networking capabilities. A player can link one's system with that of another person who owns a copy of Nintendogs to let the players' puppies play together. This is called Bark Mode. If connected with a player who has a dog not in the current player's kennel, that dog will become available. Also, players can use an item called the \\"White Record\\" to record a message. This can be used to say something to the other player. Dogs may also carry a present to give to the other player. Development First publicly mentioned in 1997, Shigesato Itoi (designer of EarthBound), Tsunekazu Ishihara (designer of Pok√©mon), and Shigeru Miyamoto codeveloped a Nintendo 64 prototype of a pet creature breeding game called Cabbage. Its four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the realtime clock and mass writability introduced in the requisite 64DD peripheral \\"such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature\\" and with optionally purchasable enhancement data. A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy and can be synchronized back to the 64DD disk, via the Transfer Pak. It was expected for release in 1998 and then in 2000, but all further development was distracted. In 2006, Miyamoto concluded: \\"It disappeared, didn't it ... However, the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making Cabbage are, of course, connected to Nintendogs and other things that we're doing now.\\" The project which ultimately became Nintendogs began as a technical demo on the Nintendo GameCube long before it was considered for the DS. It was migrated to the DS when the handheld was still in development. Shigeru Miyamoto originally came up with the idea for the game when he and his family bought a dog, which inspired him to create the project. The game's producer, Hideki Konno, looking for a game to take full advantage of all of the Nintendo DS's features, decided on a dog simulation game. Nintendogs, first called Puppy Times, was originally designed to have fifteen different versions, one for each breed of dog. Satoru Iwata suggested this to convey the feel that the player was choosing a dog from a kennel. However, the debugging process for each version was deemed too time-consuming to be feasible. After going back and forth between several versions, they eventually settled on three, with six dogs each and the rest available after completing in-game goals. Merchandise In late 2005, Nintendo of America released the first series of Nintendogs \\"6-Card Fun Paks\\". Three different pack designs (each based on the US-released designs of the DS game) contains an assortment of \\"Collectible cards, stickers & more!\\". Each pack randomly contains two of 18 different Breed cards, one of nine different Dog in Training tip cards, one of six different Miscellaneous cards, one of 18 different Pop-Up Cards, one of six sundry sheets of stickers, one of four temporary tattoos, and one Sweepstakes card. Another series of these cards were released in early 2007 by Enterplay, LLC.Nintendogs - Is That One Good? These cards, officially licensed by Nintendo, were created by the same individuals who worked on the first series. As such, the cards greatly resemble the first series. Keeping the \\"6-Card Fun Pak\\" name, each package contains two of 20 different At the Kennel cards (which feature all eighteen breeds from the games, including the Dalmatian and Jack Russell Terrier), one of nine Dog in Training tip cards, one of four Miscellaneous cards, one of 20 Pop-Up Cards, one of six sheets of stickers, one of four temporary tattoos and one Sweepstakes card. The next series also features three sundry packages, this time with a Dalmatian, Beagle, and Pug on the front of the package. A line of Nintendogs plush toys were released in Japan, featuring the most popular breeds in each game. They are also available at the Nintendo World Store. Various Nintendogs T-shirts were also made available at the Nintendo World Store. In Europe and Australia, a series of plush toys with an electronic sensor were released, and when the owner shook the bone, the dog would walk and bark. Nintendo has also released a set of plushes through Earthwood Toys. Reception The game has been well received by critics, with an average score of 85% at Game Rankings. In the May 2005 edition of the Famitsu, a popular Japanese gaming magazine, Nintendogs received a perfect 40/40 score. Only four other games had attained this score at the time.Ashcraft, Brian. Famitsu Gives Metal Gear Solid 4 Perfect Score. Kotaku.com. Retrieved 06-04-2008. It also received an 8.5 out of 10 in Nintendo Power. Game Informer gave Nintendogs an 8 out of 10, reflecting on the game's lack of an ending. Game Oracle gave it 85% and a recommendation saying that unlike most sims, it has a lot of depth. =Sales= In the first week of its release in Japan (April 18, 2005 to April 24, 2005), the three versions, Shiba Inu & Friends, Miniature Dachshund & Friends, and Chihuahua & Friends, sold 75,000, 49,000, and 44,000 respectively, totalling 168,000 units. This title game also boosted the Nintendo DS system sales by over 4.2 times the previous week to 95,000 units, up from 22,000. It was the 91st best- selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 142,591 copies combined, with lifetime sales of 1,850,984 combined. =Awards= In addition to recognitions from publications such as Entertainment Weekly, BusinessWeek, and the Chicago Sun Times, Nintendogs also won a wide variety of awards. * E3 2005 Game Critics Awards: Best Handheld Game. * TheG33ks Bronze Award for best Nintendo DS game. * Associated Press: \\"Best Game of 2005\\" * 2005 Japan Media Arts Festival: Excellence Prize * PC World: \\"2006 Innovation Award\\" * D&AD;: Yellow Pencils Award 2006 * PETA: Best Animal-Friendly Video Game 2006 * IGN: Editors' Choice Award * IGN: Best use of touch screen for Nintendo DS * GameSpot: Editors' Choice award Nintendogs also had very successful launches in North America and Europe, with first week sales of over 250,000 and 160,000 respectively. Lab & Friends received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. ELSPA also gave Dalmatian & Friends a \\"Platinum\\" award, for at least 300,000 sales in the United Kingdom. By August 2006, in the United States, Chihuahua & Friends had sold 570,000 copies and earned $17 million; Labrador & Friends had sold 620,000 copies and earned $19 million; and Dachshund & Friends had sold 730,000 copies and earned $22 million. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, the games were respectively the 50th, 44th and 32nd highest-selling games launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in the United States. On March 23, 2006 at GDC 2006, Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata announced that international sales of Nintendogs sales had reached 6 million. By March 31, 2008, the game was the best-selling Nintendo DS game published by Nintendo. As of March 31, 2015, the combined sales of all versions has reached 23.96 million and it is now second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list behind New Super Mario Bros.. =Legacy= In 2010, 1UP.com included Nintendogs in their list of five \\"Essential Newcomers\\" of the decade, describing it as one of \\"five revolutionary new games\\" of the past 10 years, for its impact on drawing \\"non-gamers to console and portable systems,\\" and establishing the \\"new\\" Nintendo. Despite derision from many hardcore gamers, Nintendogs sold tens of millions, mostly among casual gamers, and paved the way for the Nintendo DS's worldwide success. This gave rise to a non-game trend, previously limited to PCs, on consoles and portables. Nintendo followed it up with more casual games such as Brain Age, Wii Sports and Wii Fit, establishing Nintendo as the most successful developer and publisher of the decade. Sequel It was announced during Nintendo's 2010 E3 presentation that Shigeru Miyamoto was working on a new Nintendogs project, involving some new innovations. The game, titled Nintendogs + Cats was finished in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS and was released as a launch title in all regions. A microgame based on Nintendogs appears in the game WarioWare: Smooth Moves. A Nintendogs Labrador Retriever puppy also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as an assist trophy; owing to the nonviolent nature of the Nintendogs game, rather than fighting actively, the dog \\"plays\\" in front of the screen, blocking view. Also, there are multiple Nintendogs downloadable content available in the game Animal Crossing: City Folk. A French bulldog appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, taking the role of the Labrador Retriever. There is also a Nintendogs + Cats stage on the 3DS version. Both the assist trophy and the stage from this game reappear in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

History Founded in 2001 by Britney K. Brimhall and Christopher T. Warren as Tierra Entertainment, the group is best known for their remakes of the popular King's Quest games. AGD Interactive uses Adventure Game Studio to create their games. On December 10, 2003, they stopped using the name Tierra Entertainment and started referring to themselves as AGD Interactive (AGD stands for Anonymous Game Developer). Subsequently, in their games, the two lead designers (the two founders of AGD Interactive, that is) are credited as \\"Anonymous Game Designer #1\\" (Britney K. Brimhall) and \\"Anonymous Game Developer #2\\" (Christopher T. Warren). Actual anonymity is not implied; details on the team are provided online. They have also formed a commercial company, Himalaya Studios, which will focus on creating original, point-and-click adventure games with high-resolution graphics. Released games =King's Quest I Remake= AGDI's first release was a critically acclaimed point-and-click remake of King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown, released for download free of charge on August 8, 2001. This remake is known as King's Quest I VGA. In the month of its initial release, sales of Sierra's official King's Quest VIII: The Mask of Eternity skyrocketed. On January 17, 2009, AGDI released version 4.0 of the game, which, among other improvements, included enhanced backgrounds, the addition of narration vocals, and a new optional feature that can remove the walking dead situations which previously could have caused the game to become impossible to complete. =King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones= One year after the initial release of their King's Quest I remake, on December 3, 2002, AGDI followed up with the release of their second free remake, a complete overhaul of King's Quest II. This remake is known as King's Quest II+: Romancing the Stones. King's Quest II+ won the 2002 AGS Awards for Best Game, Best Story, Best Animation, Best Music, Best Scripting, Best Documentation. Both games have been greeted by Sierra fans with enthusiasm, and consider these remakes almost equal to Sierra's later King's Quest VI. On March 14, 2009, AGDI released version 3.0, which features enhanced backgrounds, narrator vocals, character lip-syncing, detailed character portraits, and many other additions that increase the game's overall level of quality. =King's Quest III Redux= On February 2011, AGDI released a remake of King's Quest III: To Heir is Human. The game is titled King's Quest III Redux, and continues the non-canon plot and lore that was established in AGDI's previous King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones remake. The game is not a 1:1 remake, and is not a complete overhaul like KQ2+ was, but features more fleshed-out characters, new areas, and puzzles not seen in the original Sierra version. =Quest for Glory II Remake= AGDI's remake of the popular Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire was released on August 24, 2008. The remake includes extra content (such as a Saurus Repair Shop that was cut from the original release due to memory constraints), a more interactive battle system, additional dialogue interface options, and the option to have a simplified alleyway layout since the original was hard to navigate. Polygon considers the game to be one of the best fan remakes of a video game ever. PC World's Jim Norris also gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, considering it a \\"hand-polished classic\\", and the best of AGD Interactive's remakes. Canceled games =Royal Quest= The King's Quest remake was being developed simultaneously with a parody of the same game entitled Royal Quest: Retrieving Lost Shit. The game was canceled, as the team \\"believed that it did not promote the values and tone they were trying to preserve in remaking the old Sierra classics.\\" =Space Quest II= Up until early 2002, the AGDI development team was working on a VGA remake of Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge. However, due to the lead programmer's sudden disappearance, the development team realized that they wouldn't have the resources required to dedicate to both the Space Quest II remake and the King's Quest II remake. As a result, the Space Quest II remake was put on indefinite hold. A small 3-room demo was released to show the progress that had been done on the Space Quest II remake up to the point when it was canceled. Infamous Adventures, another development team that remakes classic Sierra games, has a remake available since December 2011.

Sandman, a realtor by profession, was soon followed by Benjamin Cohen and then Barney Friedman, who opened a dry goods store. Isaac Bessel and his wife, Esther, moved to the community in the 1880s. Isaac was the proprietor of a feed and grain store and sold horses. His home often served as a stopping place for Jewish travelers who were unable to reach their own homes in time for the Sabbath. For well over a decade, these were the only Jewish families in Glen Cove. The Jewish population of the community began to increase in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Young Jews came from Europe to escape persecution. With few trades open to them in Europe, they turned towards retailing and peddling to support their young families.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones and co-written by Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce. The short was released on September 6, 1947, and features Hubie and Bertie. House Hunting Mice, among many other animated shorts, features the song \\"Powerhouse\\" by Raymond Scott when the automated sweeping robots pursue the two mice. Plot Outside a model \\"home of tomorrow\\" designed by Frank Lloyd Wrong, Hubie calls up Bertie and chides him for wearing a flower on his head. In the hopes of finding a home with plenty of food, the mice head on up to the House of Tomorrow. Upon entry, they step on the welcome mat, which activates an audio recording that welcomes visitors to the House of Tomorrow and invites them to try out the many gadgets the house provides. At first, Bertie is scared by the recording and tries to run away, but Hubie stops him and points out that this is the perfect place for them as everything for them can provided at the touch of a button. As a demonstration, Hubie pushes a button to the Automatic Record Player: the record player rises up out of the floor, a robotic arm on a table picks out a record disc from a collection of records and tosses it like a frisbee, and two robotic arms (one of them has a catcher's mitt) catch the record, put it on the turntable, and start playing the record. Hubie and Bertie then start dancing to the music that plays, until Hubie spies a button that demonstrates the Automatic Sweeper. Upon pressing the button, a cigarette lighter lights a cigar, a robotic puffer puffs the cigar, and a robotic arm taps the cigar ash on to the floor. This summons the Robot Sweeper, a robot armed with a broom and having a dustpan near its wheels, that comes out, sweeps up the ash into its dustpan, sweeps it into the refuse bin, and returns to its closet. Impressed by what Hubie meant by the perfect house, Bertie insists on pushing the next button they come across, but Hubie slaps him and states that he himself will be pushing the buttons as Bertie isn't smart enough to do so. As the mice go up onto the kitchen counter where some unlabeled buttons are, Bertie again requests to push a button. Hubie gives in, but (out of fear that whatever button Bertie presses might hurt him) gets a safe distance away on the other side of the kitchen before giving Bertie the A-OK. Bertie presses a button, where a light next to it reveals it's the laundry button. This makes a vacuum appear above a hamper, where Hubie just happens to be, and suck up Hubie and the laundry. Bertie then cringes and shakes as, offscreen (and to the tune of \\"Here we go round the mulberry bush\\"), Hubie goes through the washing, rinsing, mangling, ironing, and folding processes. The laundry is then returned all pressed and ironed, with Hubie (looking pressed and ironed himself) at the top. As a result, Hubie slaps Bertie for putting him through that. The laundry incident is quickly forgotten when both mice spy a button labeled \\"Cheese Dispenser\\". When Hubie presses the button, a wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes to the floor, which summons the Sweeper to come out, sweep up the mess, and put it in the bin. To prevent losing the second wheel of cheese, Hubie arranges for Bertie to stand by to catch the cheese with a plate. Straight after Hubie presses the button, another wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes on top of Bertie and the plate. Again, the Sweeper comes out, sweeps up the mess and Bertie, sweeps them into the bin, and return to its closet. Bertie escapes the bin, but thinking that Bertie is \\"escaping refuse\\", the Sweeper comes back out, sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet. Twice, Bertie peeks out, but the Sweeper sticks its head out as if to say \\"Oh, no you don't!\\" Seeing this, Hubie comes up with a plan to rescue Bertie. He does this by taking a large vase up to the house's second floor and tossing it out the window, where it crashes to the ground. As expected, the Sweeper takes the bait, rushes up to the second floor (allowing Bertie to escape), and jumps out the window where it too crashes to the ground. Afterwards, Bertie is thanking Hubie for saving him when the doorbell rings and Bertie answers it. It's the Sweeper (looking battered from its fall) and, as a way of saying \\"Nobody tricks me into jumping out of a window and gets away with it\\", it sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet. Coming up with another plan to save Bertie, Hubie pushes a box full of dynamite and fireworks off a shelf and onto the floor. Detecting the new mess, the Sweeper leaves its closet (allowing Bertie to escape again), sweeps up the explosives, and sweeps them into the bin. Hubie then pushes a lit candle and its holder off the shelf and onto the floor, once more making the Sweeper fall for the ruse. The Sweeper sweeps up the candle and sweeps it into the bin, but the lit candle makes contact with the explosives already in the bin and they blow up on the Sweeper. The Sweeper rolls away (dazed and severely damaged by the explosion) and breaks apart to pieces on the floor, but its hand presses a button labeled \\"Repair Service\\". This summons the Robot Medic, a hodgepodge looking robot with pincers, a hammer, and a crane arm. The Robot Medic leaves the same closet the Sweeper resides in, rebuilds the Sweeper offscreen, and both robots return to their closet. To really drive the Sweeper crazy, Hubie and Bertie nail the floor doors of the Automatic Record Player shut so that when Hubie presses the button, the record player can't rise up out of the floor. The robotic arm still picks out a record and tosses it, but with nothing to catch it, the record crashes against the wall and breaks into pieces which land on the floor, thus summoning the Sweeper to clean up the mess. Hubie then increases the robotic arm's speed to fast, thus making the robotic arm toss the records at the wall faster than ever before. The Sweeper returns to clean up the mess from the next record, but soon finds itself facing flying records that smash against the wall and tries to keep with cleaning up one mess after another. Soon, the Sweeper's dustpan is so full of broken record pieces that when it tries to empty them into the bin, they just bury the bin. Fed up with the ever increasing messes, the Sweeper dons a coat and hat, picks up a briefcase, puts an \\"I Quit!\\" sign on its closet door, and leaves the house. Hubie starts to revel in their victory over the Sweeper, but the victory is short lived when Bertie spies a button labeled \\"Spring Cleaning Service\\" and stupidly pushes it. This ends up summoning a whole army of Robot Sweepers that come straight out of another closet and begin cleaning up the place. Hubie and Bertie try to escape the onslaught, but get caught up in a carpet being rolled up by one of the Sweepers and taken outside. In the cartoon's final scene, as the Sweepers begin the carpet beating process and whack the mice in the process, Hubie says \\"HEY, BOIT! C'MERE!\\" and starts repeatedly slapping Bertie for getting them into this recent mess.

The short was originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 9, 1946. This short is a follow-up of sorts to Freleng's 1941 Academy Award- nominated short Rhapsody in Rivets, which featured the \\"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\\" by Franz Liszt. The \\"instrument\\" used to perform the Hungarian Rhapsody in Rhapsody in Rivets is a skyscraper under construction, while this short features Bugs playing the piece at a piano, while being pestered by a mouse. In 1946, film critic James Agee wrote in The Nation that the short is \\"the funniest thing I have seen since the decline of sociological dancing,\\" saying, \\"The best of it goes two ways: one, very observant parody of concert-pianistic affectations, elegantly thought out and synchronized; the other, brutality keyed into the spirit of the music to reach greater subtlety than I have ever seen brutality reach before.\\" Rhapsody Rabbit was the first cartoon to be broadcast on Cartoon Network when the channel launched on October 1, 1992. Plot The cartoon opens with a bar of \\"Merrily We Roll Along\\", followed by a segment of the \\"lively\\" portion of Wagner's Siegfried funeral march, as Bugs walks onstage to applause and prepares to play the grand piano. Throughout the cartoon he runs through a large assortment of visual gags while continuing to play the Hungarian Rhapsody. The first gag involves an (off-screen) audience member who coughs and hacks loudly just as Bugs is poised to play. When it happens a second time, Bugs pulls a revolver out of his tailcoat and shoots the audience member. After blowing the smoke from the barrel and returning the gun to his pocket, Bugs resumes the concert. Bugs Bunny prepares to play the piano. Although the film is mostly pantomime, Bugs speaks a few times. At one point he is interrupted by the ring of a phone, timed to echo a short fluttering strain that Bugs is playing at that moment. The phone is inside the piano: \\"Eh, what's up doc? Who? Franz Liszt? Never [heard] of him. Wrong number.\\" When playing a repeated, descending three-note sequence in the middle of the piece, which happens to be the same three-note sequence (Mi-Re-Do) notably used in the unrelated Rossini aria \\"Largo al factotum\\" (from The Barber of Seville, which would be spoofed in a later Bugs cartoon), Bugs accompanies his piano playing by singing, \\"Fi-ga-ro! Fi-ga-ro!\\" A mouse appears and pesters Bugs the rest of the way, although the first (\\"slow\\") half of the piece is played nearly \\"straight\\", with just a few small gags. Bugs stops at the very short pause in the piece, acknowledging the applause of the audience. Before he can begin the \\"fast\\" part of the piece (where the gags accelerate), the mouse instigates a major musical shift, to a \\"Boogie-woogie\\" number. Bugs joins in, although he eventually traps the mouse (which responds by playing \\"Chopsticks\\" while still trapped) and seemingly disposes of the pest with dynamite; when the mouse begins quietly playing \\"Taps\\" and stops 1 note short, Bugs peeks inside and the mouse \\"plays\\" the final note by hitting Bugs with a mallet. Bugs then returns to playing the Rhapsody. As the pace picks up, he speaks to the camera (for the last time in the cartoon): \\"Look! One hand! ... NO hands!\\" The camera pulls back, and he is deftly playing the piano keys with his toes. Nearing the end of the Rhapsody, he is in shock after turning to the finale page which consist of scrambled, quick playing, nearly impossible to read notes after which he takes off his shirt, oils his hands, and prays. Then, preparing to play the intense part, he is startled to hear the frenzied final√© playing, behind him. It is the mouse, complete with tie and tails, playing a toy piano that plays like a normal-sounding piano. Cut back to Bugs after the full-orchestra final√©, and he disgustedly plays the three single notes that actually end the piece, and then mutters inaudible profanity which can be lip-read as the short ends. Cast Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny and Coughing Audience Member Availability The short is available on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, with an optional commentary track by musical historian Daniel Goldmark. It is also available on volume 2 of Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection, as well as the WarnerMedia Entertainment video streaming service HBO Max. Plagiarism dispute The same year Warner Bros. released Rhapsody Rabbit, MGM produced a very similar Tom and Jerry cartoon called The Cat Concerto, which features Tom being distracted by Jerry while playing in a concert.Pianist Envy, Thad Komorowski, February 26, 2013 Several of the gags are identical in both cartoons, and both cartoons use Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 as the piece being played.Rhapsody Rabbit (1946) Trivia, imdb.com The Cat Concerto won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Both MGM and Warner Bros. accused each other of plagiarism, after both films were shown in the 1947 Academy Awards Ceremony. Technicolor was accused of sending a print of either cartoon to a competing studio, who then plagiarized their rival's work. This remains uncertain even today: though Rhapsody Rabbit has an earlier MPAA approval number and release date, MGM's cartoons took longer to make. The massive similarities could be coincidental. The controversy was mentioned in an episode of the Cartoon Network anthology series ToonHeads.Rhapsody Rabbit VS The Cat ConcertoThe Great Cartoon Controversy, tv.com See also * Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940‚Äì1949) * List of Bugs Bunny cartoons * The Cat Concerto (1947), a Tom and Jerry cartoon * Convict Concerto (1954), a Woody Woodpecker cartoon * Daffy's Rhapsody (2012), a Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd cartoon * Pink, Plunk, Plink (1966), a Pink Panther cartoon * Mickey Mousing, a film technique that syncs the accompanying music with the actions on screen References External links * * Category:1946 films Category:1946 short films Category:1946 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ","title":"Rhapsody Rabbit"},{"id":"1157028","text":"Preserver can refer to: * Life preserver, a personal flotation device or lifebuoy * Life preserver, a type of club (weapon) * , a Canadian navy ship ** , Protecteur-class supply ship ** , leadship of the Fairmile-support depot ships * , a U.S. navy ship * Preserver (Elfquest), a race in the fantasy comic Elfquest * Preservers (Star Trek), a Star Trek species * Preserver (Star Trek), a novel by William Shatner ","title":"Preserver"},{"id":"1157035","text":"Adlai E.

Some texts that the course includes are the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, Plato‚Äôs Five Dialogues, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Sigmund Freud's Society and Its Discontents, Sartre's Existentialism is a Humanism, The Communist Manifesto, Persepolis_(comics), and much more. Students enjoy the small seminar sections, to discuss many ideas relating to ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúsociety.‚Äù  Living at Stevenson  At Stevenson College, there are eight dormitory houses that are separated into two adjacent locations: ‚Äúupper quad‚Äù and ‚Äúlower quad.‚Äù Each house contains single, double, triple rooms, and quad rooms, and can house approximately 60 students. Stevenson College also has apartments that are an option for non-freshman undergraduate students. They house approximately 136 students, and come fully furnished. The knoll, which has views of Monterey Bay, is a common hangout for Stevenson students, with students studying, napping, and sun bathing on the knoll throughout the year. The Stevenson Coffee House is also a hangout where students and professors eat, socialize, and study. The Stevenson Library is a quieter location to work on papers and assignments. Stevenson College is located above the university‚Äôs gym and pool.  Community at Stevenson  Stevenson College also holds events for its community. College Night happens two to three times a quarter, where students eat specially themed meals with some type of live entertainment. Open Mic Nights at the Stevenson Coffee House are also an event that occurs several times a month. Anybody can sign up, and some students perform songs, recite poetry, or perform magic tricks. The Resident Assistants (RAs) at Stevenson College also host events each quarter.  References  City On a Hill Press. Jan 2009 ed.

Early years Geidl's father was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army based in Kotor. His mother was a poor Montenegrin noblewoman. Later, the family moved to Kyjov, Moravia, where Geidl studied at a secondary grammar school. In 1910 he went through one year of compulsory military service in Mostar. Afterwards Geidl left for the Balkans and likely took part in the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13). At the start of World War I he rejoined the Austro-Hungarian Army and served in Dalmatia and Sarajevo. In September 1915 he was taken prisoner in Vi≈°egrad, Bosnia. Legions Immediately after his capture, Geidl switched sides and was commissioned as a captain in the Montenegrin Army. Having some experience as an apothecary, he pretended to be a physician.http://psp.cz/eknih/1929ns/ps/stenprot/110schuz/s110007.htm Following the collapse of the Montenegrin Army in 1916, Gajda escaped into Russia where he joined a Serbian battalion as a physician. At the end of 1916 the battalion was destroyed and Gajda joined the Czechoslovak Legions (30 January 1917) as a staff captain. Gajda proved himself as an able commander in the Battle of Zborov and quickly rose through the military hierarchy. During the evacuation of the Legion in May 1918 Precl√≠k, Vratislav.

Czechoslovak soldiers quickly occupied large tracts of the railway east of the Volga. Gajda commanded the area from Novonikolayevsk (Novosibirsk) north to Irkutsk. Aggressive tactics, sometimes against the orders of his superiors, helped to defeat the Bolshevik forces and connect all units of the Legion. This contributed to his conflict with Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk,Milan Nakoneƒçn√Ω: Zneuctƒõn√Ω a zapomenut√Ω hrdina (PDF) who wanted the Legions to stay neutral in the Russian civil war. After the capture of Yekaterinburg by the Legion and the White Army in July 1918, he set up his headquarters in the city, establishing his office at the Ipatiev House, incidentally where the imprisoned Romanovs has been murdered by the Bolsheviks less than a week prior to the capture of the city. The most successful operation was the capture of Perm (24 December 1918) where the Legion took 20,000 prisoners and seized 5,000 railway cars, 60 cannon, 1,000 machine guns and the fleet frozen in the Kama River. Gajda enjoyed widespread popularity amongst his troops and throughout the White movement. He was promoted to Major-General and nicknamed \\"the Siberian Ataman\\" and \\"the Siberian Tiger.\\" He later accepted an invitation from Aleksandr Kolchak to become a commander in his army. His career with Kolchak was less successful‚Äîthe Red Army had begun to take the initiative while Kolchak's forces dwindled away. Gajda, out of Kolchak's favor, was dismissed on 5 July 1919. After involving himself in the unsuccessful mutiny of Esers against Kolchak (17 November 1919) he escaped from Siberia and sailed to Europe. Military career in Czechoslovakia Poster of general Radola Gajda. After arriving in Czechoslovakia in early 1920, Gajda was given a pension and the rank of General, but was not assigned a command. In November 1920 he was sent to study military theory at the √âcole sup√©rieure de guerre in France. He also studied agriculture at the Institut Technique de Pratique Agricole. Gajda returned two years later. On 9 October 1922, he was given command of the 11th Division in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. His involvement in the cultural life of the region soon endeared him to the locals. On 1 December 1924 he was named Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Prague under General Eug√®ne Mittelhauser, head of French military mission in Czechoslovakia. Gajda became a rival of Mittelhauser and Mittelhauser's predecessor Maurice Pell√©. In this capacity, Gajda worked successfully to limit the influence of the mission, which was brought to an end in 1926. On 20 March 1926 he became Acting Chief of the General Staff. In his position he backed up former legionnaires against former loyalist Austrian officers. Under pressure from president Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk Gajda was forced to retire, because he had publicly shown himself sympathetic to Italian fascism. Combined with envy, political intrigue and fear of a military coup (similar to the contemporary May Coup in Poland) this led to the dismissal of the ambitious general. Politics Still a young man of 34, Gajda decided to turn to politics. At the end of 1926 he took part in the founding of the National Fascist Community (), modeled on Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party and became its leader on 2 January 1927. In 1929 the party took several seats in parliament. In 1931 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank due to a prior scandal. During the night of 21-22 January 1933, the ≈Ωidenice Mutiny broke out in Brno. This was an attempt on the part of 70 to 80 local fascists to overthrow the government by means of a military coup. The mutiny was immediately suppressed. Gajda was arrested the next day and charged with inciting the coup. Initially he was absolved of wrongdoing but after political pressure the verdict was revised. Gajda was sentenced to six months in prison and the forfeiture of his military pension. Grave of Radola Gajda in Prague (2003), damaged by vandals in April 2007 The NOF was somewhat successful in the 1935 elections and Gajda obtained a seat in parliament, which he was to hold until 1939. At this time, the NOF had a strong anti-German orientation, supported a military buildup and favored war with Nazi Germany over the Sudetenland. (After the Munich Agreement Gajda, as a gesture of defiance, returned all French and British honors and medals.) In 1939 he was rehabilitated and restored to the rank of General. He also became active in the newly established Party of National Unity (). During March 1939, the Czechoslovakian political scene was in state of turmoil. Several coups were attempted, one in anticipation of making Gajda the new head of state. These amateurish coups ended in fiasco and several days later the remaining Czech lands were occupied by Nazi Germany. Gajda was marginalized during the occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers to flee into Poland and by hiding the resistance activities of his son. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment. When World War II ended Gajda was imprisoned by the NKVD (12 May 1945) and interrogated under harsh conditions (he lost his eyesight while jailed). Last years In April 1947 he was brought to trial for \\"propagation of Fascism and Nazism\\", for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda's guilt was far from clear and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly thereafter. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later.

Life Zwengauer was born in Munich, Bavaria. He studied at the Academy of Art in his home town under, among others, Peter von Cornelius. Zwengauer found himself attracted to landscape painting, in which there was no formal training at the Academy, and at the age of 17 he therefore began to travel through the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, returning from each trip with large quantities of sketches and watercolours. His artistic breakthrough came with his painting Sonnenuntergang im Dachauer Moos (\\"Sunset in the Dachauer Moos\\"), which immediately became well-known and much-discussed in the Munich art world. His sunsets became so well known that all paintings with sunsets were referred to, half admiringly and half ironically, as \\"Zwengauers\\". In 1835 Maximilian II, King of Bavaria, appointed him conservator of the picture gallery of Schloss Schleissheim and in 1869 promoted him to the same post in the royal picture gallery, the later Alte Pinakothek. In the selection of his motifs Zwengauer always tried to represent the inherent strength and peace of natural landscapes in an almost solemn mood. He often painted sunsets, in which he aimed to achieve impressive effects of light and colour by simple means. Zwengauer died aged 73 on 13 June 1884 in Munich and is buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof.M√ºnchner Friedh√∂fe A street in Solln in south Munich - Zwengauerweg - is named after him.

It was developed primarily at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in collaboration with University of Toronto and University of New Mexico. The main focus of this OS is to address performance and scalability issues of system software on large-scale, shared memory, NUMA multiprocessor computers. K42 utilizes a microkernel architecture rather than the traditional monolithic kernel design. K42 consists of a small exception- handling component that serves as the microkernel, a fast IPC mechanism called protected procedure call (PPC), and servers for most other components of the operating system. These servers exist in separate address spaces and rely upon the fast IPC mechanism for communication with the microkernel and other servers. History The core of K42 is based on the University of Toronto's Tornado Operating System. K42 is the university's third generation of research on scalable operating systems. Tornado OS / nuMachine Multiprocessor was the second generation and Hurricane OS / Hector Multiprocessor was the first generation. Features K42 currently supports the Linux PPC64 and PPC32 ABIs, so most PowerPC Linux binaries can run on K42 without modification, including the DB2 relational database. K42 has some device drivers implemented specifically for it, but it gets most of its hardware support by directly linking in Linux device drivers to a special server. Another goal of the K42 design is to achieve a customizable and maintainable system. Being built with an object-oriented design, it allows applications to customize and thus optimize the OS services required, and then on the fly hot swap kernel object implementations. This is particularly important for applications, such as databases and web servers, where the ability to control physical resources can improve performance.

The city's name is derived from that of the Bulgarian capital of the time, Preslav, and means Little Preslav (Byzantine Greek: ). In Greek it was also known as Presthlavitza (Œ†œÅŒµœÉŒ∏ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒØœÑŒ∂Œ±). Several theories exist regarding the exact location of the city: either at Preslav or in its vicinity in Bulgaria, or at Isaccea, NufƒÉru, Murighiol or Jurilovca in Romania. A thriving trade centre of the First Bulgarian Empire, it was captured by Prince Svyatoslav of Kievan Rus in 968 (See Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria). During Svyatoslav's absence from the city following the Siege of Kiev (968), part of the citizens revolted and opened the gate to Bulgarian forces. According to Vasily Tatischev, Svyatoslav's governor Volk managed to escape. Upon his return to Bulgaria, Svyatoslav promptly suppressed the rebellion and, to the chagrin of his mother and relatives, transferred the capital from Kiev to Pereyaslavets. According to the Primary Chronicle (its record for year 969), Svyatoslav explained to his courtiers that it was to Pereyaslavets, the centre of his lands, that \\"all the riches would flow: gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from Greece, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, and from Ruthenia furs, wax, honey, and ancient laws\\". Two years later, the town fell to the Byzantines, who had launched their own invasion of Bulgaria, and became the seat of a Byzantine strategos. Excavations have identified a late 10th century Byzantine fortress at the village of NufƒÉru, Romania (known as Prislav until 1968), on the Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe branch of the Danube, just 11 km east of Tulcea, which may indicate it was the location of the Presthlavitza mentioned in Byzantine source.

He is one of the founder members of the √âcole de la Cause freudienne (School of the Freudian Cause) and the World Association of Psychoanalysis which he presided from 1992 to 2002. He is the sole editor of the books of The Seminars of Jacques Lacan. Life and career =1960s= Miller's career began early, interviewing Jean-Paul Sartre in 1960 when he was sixteen years old . At the time he was in kh√¢gne at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand and studying Latin in private classes with Jean-Louis Laugier who gave him \\"the desire to be a Normalien\\".Miller, J.-A. The Tenderness of Terrorists. In 1962, he entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure where he studied with Louis Althusser. There he befriended fellow students who would also go on to leave a lasting mark on intellectual life in France: √âtienne Balibar, Pierre Macherey, Fran√ßois Regnault, Robert Linart and Jean-Claude Milner. At the ENS he attended the seminars of Roland Barthes, the \\"first writer with whom I had a close friendship\\".Jacques-Alain Miller interviewed by M. Quenehen on France Culture Radio, 17 October 2011. At this time he also met the young Derrida who was lecturing at the Sorbonne. In 1963, Althusser assigned Miller the task of reading \\"all of Lacan\\" and Miller carried out the task admiringly. The following year, Jacques Lacan was appointed lecturer at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and transferred his Seminar to the ENS. Miller's encounter with Lacan was to be a decisive one: he contributed to the Seminar first with questions, then with full texts over the following years. Over the summer break of 1964, Lacan invited Miller to his country house, La Pr√©v√¥t√© in Guitrancourt, where Miller read the transcriptions of Lacan's early seminars. During a later stay at Guitrancourt, Miller began a relationship with Judith Lacan, Lacan's daughter, whom he married in 1966. The index of concepts and the commentary on the graphs in Lacan's 1966 √âcrits were drawn up by Miller, and in that same year, he founded Cahiers pour l'Analyse, a seminal publication whose editorial board included Alain Grosrichard, Regnault, Milner and, later, Alain Badiou. Miller's written texts from this early period are published in the Gallimard collection, Un d√©but dans la vie (2002) which includes his interview with Sartre and the influential text presented at Lacan's Seminar (24 February 1965), \\"Suture: Elements of the Logic of the Signifier\\". =1970s= After a period of active involvement in the leftwing movements associated with May 1968, Miller was encouraged by Lacan to take \\"another path by which to get your privileged revolt across: mine for example\\".Regnault, F., \\"I Was Struck by What You Said...\\" Hurly-Burly 6 p.25.

When Lacan moved to the University of Vincennes‚Äîthe Department of Psychoanalysis was renamed \\"Le Champ freudien\\"‚ÄîLacan became its director, and Michel Foucault appointed Jacques-Alain Miller president.Macey, D., The Lives of Michel Foucault p.223. Miller's teaching from this period (1972-1978) took on the name L'Orientation lacanienne and gave rise to published texts on Bentham, Peirce and Church. In 1973, Miller transcribed at Lacan's behest the 1964 Seminar on The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis which was to lead to a lifelong commitment to establishing the full series of Lacan's annual Parisian Seminar. Book XI was published by Seuil in 1973, with Books I & Book XX following in 1975 and Book II in 1978. Miller also contributed in 1973 to the two-part televised programme that later became known as \\"Television\\", leading Lacan to credit Miller by saying \\"He who interrogates me / also knows how to read me\\". =1980s= Lacan's dissolution of the EFP in 1980 was followed by the creation of La cause freudienne. Soon thereafter Lacan died, leaving Miller as the sole editor of his seminars. Miller resumed his weekly seminars in 1980, thus opening the series known as L'Orientation lacanienne II. Dedicated to expounding and elucidating Lacan's work, Miller's course was attended by many influential figures in psychoanalytic theory, notably √âric Laurent and Slavoj Zizek. The Lacanian Orientation course went under the banner of a \\"return to the clinic\\"Miller, J.-A. \\"We Are Haphazardly Driven from Pillar to Post\\" in Hurly-Burly 5 p.28. and early themes included \\"From the Symptom to the Fantasy\\" (1982-3), \\"The Differential Clinic of Psychoses\\" (1987-8 DEA seminar), and \\"Traits of Perversion\\" (1988-9). The nineteen eighties were also a period of extensive travel in Europe and Latin America to consolidate the emerging communities of Lacan's students and adherents, culminating in the founding of the European School of Psychoanalysis in 1990 (now the European Federation of the Schools of the WAP) and the Argentine Escuela de la Orientaci√≥n Lacaniana in 1992. Over this decade, Miller established Book III and Book VII of Lacan's Seminar. Miller's 1980s lectures in Buenos Aires are collected in Tome I of Conferencias Porte√±as (Paidos, 2010). =1990s= In the early nineties, Miller's work began to be translated into English and published in the United States through the Newsletter of the Freudian Field and the New York-based cultural journal Lacanian Ink under the editorship of Josefina Ayerza. In 1992, Miller launched the World Association of Psychoanalysis which grouped together the √âcole de la Cause freudienne, the European School of Psychoanalysis, and the Escuela de la Orientaci√≥n Lacaniana, and soon thereafter oversaw the creation of Schools in Brazil, Spain and Italy which were likewise included in the WAP. The end of the decade saw a \\"thaw\\" in relations with the IPA thanks to the efforts of its then President Horacio Etchegoyen.Miller, J.-A. & Etchegoyen, H., Silence bris√© : entretien sur le mouvement psychanalytique, Navarin, 1996. Miller was invited to attend the 1997 IPA Congress in Barcelona where his remarks from the floor were greeted with warm applause.Published in French in the Revue de la Cause freudienne. In 1995, Miller's weekly course moved to the Paul- Painlev√© Amphitheatre at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers, where it would continue until his retirement from University Paris-VIII in 2009. In 1998, his teaching entered its third phase as L'Orientation lacanienne III. The Buenos Aires lectures of the 1989-1996 period are collected in Tome II of Conferencias Porte√±as (Paidos, 2009). The nineteen nineties also saw the publication of Book IV, Book V and Book XVII of Lacan's Seminar, established by Miller. =2000s= After two decades devoted exclusively to training analysts and furthering worldwide institutional links, alongside the ongoing transcription of Lacan‚Äôs Seminar, 2001 saw a return to the public stage Miller had occupied in the late sixties. In June 2001, the journal of the SPP published an article that contained false and misleading information on Miller and the √âcole de la Cause freudienne. When his request to have a short note published, rectifying the factual elements, was refused by the journal‚Äôs editor, Miller turned to \\"enlightened public opinion\\" to state his case, publishing a first letter on 3 September 2001. Its enthusiastic reception by France‚Äôs intellectual community gave rise to five further lettersCollected in 2002 by Seuil as Lettres √† l'opinion √©clair√©e, the first three letters were published in English-language translation by the Wooster Press (2001) which look in detail at the issues surrounding Lacan‚Äôs 1963 \\"excommunication\\" from the IPA and the history of the psychoanalytic movement over the four ensuing decades. The third letter, penned in the wake of the September 11 attacks, also offers a reflection on terrorism and political action. In 2003, Miller founded the New Lacanian School, which groups together the societies from the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Israel, and Greece along with affiliated groups from Ireland and Eastern Europe. In the same year he published the satirical Neveu de Lacan (Verdier) in response to the 2002 pamphlet by Daniel Lindenberg, Le Rappel √† l‚Äôordre. In October 2003, the French government passed a bill intended to regulate, for the first time, the practice of psychotherapy in France.Grigg, R. Regulating Psychoanalysis: Why We Should Be Concerned Over the New Psychotherapy Legislation in France, in The Pathology of Democracy, Karnac Books, p.61 Voted in following a late-night parliamentary session that was preceded by little discussion with the professionals concerned, Miller alerted public opinion in another letter, published on 17 November, addressed to the UMP politician Bernard Accoyer. Over the following months, Miller spearheaded the movement dedicated to increasing both public and professional awareness of the issues at stake, prompting Bernard-Henri L√©vy to write: \\"Sometimes history hangs on a thread. It is quite likely that in this affair the thread bears the name of this one man: Jacques-Alain Miller\\".\\"Introduction\\" to Aflalo, A., L'Assassinat manqu√© de la psychanalyse C√©cile Defaut. The action of the Forums that assembled under Miller‚Äôs impulsion ultimately led to the revision of the Bill. The transcription of Lacan‚Äôs Seminar continued, with Book VIII (Second Edition), Book X, Book XXIII, Book XVI and Book XVIII all appearing in this decade. In 2008, at the time of the sixth WAP Congress, Miller delivered a lecture before a 1, 700 strong audience at the Teatro Coliseo. This lecture is transcribed alongside his 1996-2001 Argentine lectures collected in Tome III of Conferencias Porte√±as (Paidos, 2010). At this time, he also became a regular guest- contributor to France Culture radio and French news magazines such as Marianne and Le Point. A selection of his public articles was collected as Le secret des dieux (2005) and in 2008, he took part in the ‚ÄúRally of the Impossible Professions‚Äù in London, speaking alongside Richard Gombrich and Michael Power. In 2009, he founded Hurly-Burly, the International Lacanian Journal of Psychoanalysis.Svolos, T., \\"Reading Hurly-Burly Late into the Night\\" in Lacanian Compass, 14 p. 45.This remark was reiterated by Joel Goldbach in his review of Hurly-Burly Issue 2 in Umbr(a): Writing, 2010, p. 144. =2010‚Äìpresent= Miller's 2009-2010 course, delivered at the Th√©√¢tre D√©jazet, was dedicated to Lacan's life, examining links between Lacan's psychoanalytic ethics and biographical details that Miller had not previously related in public. The course was later partially written up and published as Vie de Lacan (2011). Miller's ongoing psychoanalytic teaching is regularly translated into English, as are his frequent articles and interviews on current events.

Definition of the Roman loggia Loggia Valmarana by Palladio, UNESCO The main difference between a loggia and a portico is the role within the functional layout of the building. The portico allows entrance to the inside from the exterior and can be found on vernacular and small scale buildings. The loggia is accessed only from inside and intended as a place for leisure. Thus, it is found mainly on noble residences and public buildings. A classic use of both is that represented in the mosaics of Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo of the Royal Palace.

The French word \\"balise\\" is used to distinguish these beacons from other kinds of beacons.http://www.proz.com/kudoz/italian_to_english/engineering_general/1098534-balise.html Balises are used in the KVB signalling system installed on main lines of the French railway network, other than the high-speed Lignes √† Grande Vitesse. Balises constitute an integral part of the European Train Control System, where they serve as \\"beacons\\" giving the exact location of a train. The ETCS signalling system is gradually being introduced on railways throughout the European Union.'EC sets out ERTMS deployment deadlines,' http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//ec-sets-out-ertms- deployment-deadlines.html Balises are also used in the Chinese Train Control System versions CTCS-2 and CTCS-3 installed on high-speed rail lines in China, which is based on the European Train Control System. A balise which complies with the European Train Control System specification is called a Eurobalise.  Overview  Balise EBICAB in the Mediterranean Corridor A balise typically needs no power source. In response to radio frequency energy broadcast by a Balise Transmission Module mounted under a passing train, the balise either transmits information to the train (uplink) or receives information from the train (downlink, although this function is rarely used). The transmission rate of Eurobalises is sufficient for a complete 'telegram' to be received by a train passing at any speed up to 500 km/h. A balise may be either a 'Fixed Data Balise,' or 'Fixed Balise' for short, transmitting the same data to every train, or a 'Transparent Data Balise' which transmits variable data, also called a 'Switchable' or 'Controllable Balise'. (Note that the word 'fixed' refers to the information transmitted by the balise, not to its physical location. All balises are immobile). A fixed balise is programmed to transmit the same data to every train. Information transmitted by a fixed balise typically includes: the location of the balise; the geometry of the line, such as curves and gradients; and any speed restrictions. The programming is performed using a wireless programming device. Thus a fixed balise can notify a train of its exact location, and the distance to the next signal, and can warn of any speed restrictions. A controllable balise is connected to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as signal indications. Balises forming part of an ETCS Level 1 signalling system employ this capability. The LEU integrates with the conventional (national) signal system either by connecting to the lineside railway signal or to the signalling control tower. Balises must be deployed in pairs so that the train can distinguish the direction of travel 1‚Üí2 from direction 2‚Üí1, unless they are linked to a previous balise group in which case they can contain only one balise. Extra balises can be installed if the volume of data is too great. Balises operate with equipment on the train to provide a system that enhances the safety of train operation: at the approaches to stations with multiple platforms fixed balises may be deployed, as a more accurate supplement to GPS, to enable safe operation of automatic selective door opening.  Installation  Eurobalises on Orivesi-Jyv√§skyl√§ railway in Muurame, Finland The balise is typically mounted on or between sleepers or ties in the centre line of the track. A train travelling at maximum speed of will transmit and receive a minimum of three copies of the telegram while passing over each Eurobalise. The earlier KER balises (KVB, EBICAB, RSDD) were specified to work up to . The train's on-board computer uses the data from the balises to determine the safe speed profile for the line ahead. Enough information is needed to allow the train to come to a safe standstill if required. The data in the balise can include the distance to the next balise. This is used to check for missing balises which could otherwise lead to a potential wrong-side failure. At the start and end of ATP equipped territory, a pair of fixed balises are often used to inform the onboard ATP equipment to start or stop supervision of the train movements.  Usage  Eurobalises are used in: * ETCS ‚Äì the European-wide train protection system * Chinese Train Control System versions CTCS-2 and CTCS-3, used on high speed rail lines in China * EuroSignum ‚Äì a variant of the earlier Swiss Integra-Signum train protection system * EuroZub ‚Äì a variant of the earlier Swiss ZUB 121 train protection system * SCMT ‚Äì an Italian train protection system * TBL1+ ‚Äì a train protection system used in Belgium * GNT ‚Äì the system to control tilting trains in Germany * ZBS ‚Äì a new rapid transit control system for the S-Bahn Berlin * TASS - a system to control the tilting of trains on the West Coast Main Line Balises other than Eurobalises are used in: * KVB - a train protection system used in France * ASFA - a train protection system used in Spain * ACSES - a train protection system used by Amtrak on the Northeast Corridor in the USA * EBICAB - a train protection system used in Norway, Sweden and other countries, including parts of Spain * C-APT - (historical) a system once developed for the APT to transmit permissible speed and airtightness information  History  The earliest automatic train protection system were purely mechanical with a tripcock which could be connected directly to the braking system by releasing the opening a switch in the hydraulic system. There were multiple incidents where trains had overrun a stop signal but due to excessive speed still crashed despite the automatic stop. Multiple systems were invented to show the speed in the driver's cab and to provide an electronic system on the train that would prevent speeding. With the advent of high-speed trains it was generally expected that a speed indicator on line-side signals is not sufficient beyond so that all these trains need cab signalling. A combined solution to the requirements was the German LZB system that was presented in 1965. The original installations were all hard-wired logic. The first real cab electronics was presented in 1972 (named LZB L72) and a cab computer was introduced by 1980 (LZB 80). The LZB system uses a wire in the middle of the tracks that had loops at a distance of so that the position of a train was known more precisely than in any earlier system. As a result, the LZB system was not only used on high-speed tracks but also in commuter rail to increase throughput. Due to the deployment costs of the system however it was restricted to these application areas. The development of a system using the principle of passive balises with fixed or controlled information started in 1975 by LMEricson and SRT, following an incindent in Norway in 1975 (Tretten). The LME/SRT system became the Ebicab system. The Ebicab system established the principles of using magnetic coupling, 27 MHz downlink from the antenna on the locomotive to energize the balises, and an uplink using 4,5 MHz to transmit information telegrams from the balises. The controlled information in the balises is encoded from statuses in the signalling system. The telegrams contains information about permitted speeds, and distances. The information is used in the on-board computer to calculate brake curves, monitor speed and eventually apply brakes. In Norway, the first line equipped with Ebicab as ATP was operational in 1983. The Ebicab principles are subsequently used in KVB and RSDD systems and also for the ERTMS ETCS balises. During the 1980s, other cab computers were introduced to read the older signalling and to overlay it with better control. The German PZ80 was able to check the speed in steps of . The French KVB replaced the external system with balises in the early 1990s to transmit a combined information for oncoming signal aspects and the allowed train speed. Siemens did also invent a successor to the PZB signalling that was deployed as in Switzerland since 1992 and in Denmark since 1992. ABB improved the external balises in the EBICAB 900 system which as then adopted in Spain and Italy. Siemens had presented a study on balise systems in 1992 which influenced the choice of using a technology based on KVB and GSM instead of LZB when the European Rail Traffic Management System was researching a possible train signalling for Europe. The first Eurobalises were tested in 1996 and later train protection systems used them as a basis for their signalling needs.

Life Scheutz studied law at Lund University, graduating in 1805. He then worked as a legal expert and translator (he translated several works of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott) before turning predominantly to liberal politics and mechanical engineering. Scheutz's calculator He is most known for his inventions; the best known of these is the Scheutzian calculation engine, invented in 1837 and finalized in 1843. This machine, which he constructed with his son Edvard Scheutz, was based on Charles Babbage's difference engine. In 1851 they obtained funds from government to build an improved model, which was created in 1853 (was roughly the size of a piano), and subsequently demonstrated at the World's Fair in Paris, 1855. The machine was then sold in 1856 to the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York. In 1857 British government ordered another model, which was built by Donkin's company in 1859. The devices were used for creating logarithmic tables. While the machine was not perfect and could not produce complete tables, Martin Wiberg reworked the construction from the ground up and in 1875 created a compact device which would print complete tables. Scheutz was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1856.

Halfbeak was launched 19 February 1946 by the Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn., sponsored by Mrs. William Craig; and commissioned 22 July 1946, Commander Evan T. Shepard in command. Service history After shakedown in the Caribbean and along the Latin American coast to the Canal Zone, Ecuador, and Colombia, Halfbeak spent the next 3 years in training operations and fleet exercises out of New London, Conn., where she was part of SubRon 8. Entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard 12 September 1949, Halfbeak was converted to a GUPPY II type submarine. Fitted with a snorkel to enable her to stay submerged for long periods of time and distinguished by a greatly streamlined superstructure, Halfbeak left Portsmouth 13 January 1950 to work with the Research and Development Group at New London. While conducting tests on special underwater sound equipment, she made a cruise to English waters, operating off Jan Mayen Island, in the winter of 1951. Halfbeak was engaged in further Caribbean exercises until 10 November 1954, when she sailed for her first Mediterranean cruise. Having visited Gibraltar, Naples, Marseilles, Lisbon, and Valencia, Spain, the submarine returned to New London 2 February 1955. A similar cruise in 1956 was punctuated by the Suez Crisis, and Halfbeak remained in the eastern Med operating with the 6th Fleet until January 1957 helping to maintain the peace in that crucial region. Her duties took another turn as 28 July 1958 she departed for the Arctic, where with the nuclear submarine she operated under and around the polar ice pack to gather information in connection with the International Geophysical Year. During these operations, Skate sailed under the Arctic ice pack to reach the North Pole 11 August and continued to cruise freely there repeating the visit 6 days later. Local operations and exercises, primarily submarine and fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean but also NATO maneuvers, occupied Halfbeak until 1963, when she resumed her role testing and evaluating sonar and other underwater sound equipment out of New London. Halfbeak was awarded the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" for 1966 and 1967 and held the \\"E\\" for Submarine Division 102 for 1968.

Without such protection, a program can write (as data \\"W\\") CPU instructions in an area of memory intended for data and then run (as executable \\"X\\"; or read-execute \\"RX\\") those instructions. This can be dangerous if the writer of the memory is malicious. W^X is the Unix-like terminology for a strict use of the general concept of executable space protection, controlled via the system call. W^X is relatively simple on processors that support fine-grained page permissions, such as Sun's SPARC and SPARC64, AMD's AMD64, Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC, HP's (originally Digital Equipment Corporation's) Alpha, and ARM. W^X has also been applied to file system write/execute permissions to mitigate file write vulnerabilities (as with in memory) and attacker persistence. Enforcing restrictions on file permissions can also close gaps in W^X enforcement caused by memory mapped files. Outright forbidding the usage of arbitrary native code can also mitigate kernel and CPU vulnerabilities not exposed via the existing code on the computer.  Compatibility  Some early Intel 64 processors lacked the NX bit required for W^X, but this appeared in later chips. On more limited processors such as the Intel i386, W^X requires using the CS code segment limit as a \\"line in the sand\\", a point in the address space above which execution is not permitted and data is located, and below which it is allowed and executable pages are placed. This scheme was used in Exec Shield. Linker changes are generally required to separate data from code (such as trampolines that are needed for linker and library runtime functions). The switch allowing mixing is usually called \`execstack\` on Unix-like systems W^X can also pose a minor problem for just-in-time compilation, which involves an interpreter generating machine code on the fly and then running them. The simple solution used by most, including Firefox, involves just making the page executable after the interpreter is done writing machine code, using on Windows or on Unix-likes. The other solution involves mapping the same region of memory to two pages, one with RW and the other with RX. There is no simple consensus on which solution is safer: supporters of the latter approach believe that some critics believe allowing a page that has ever been writable to be executed defeats the point of W^X (there exists an SELinux policy to control such operations called ) and that address space layout randomization would make it safe to put both pages in the same process. Supporters of the former approach believe that the latter approach is only safe when the two pages are given to two separate processes, and inter-process communication would be costlier than calling .  History  W^X was first implemented in OpenBSD 3.3, released May 2003. In 2004, Microsoft introduced a similar feature called DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows XP. Similar features are available for other operating systems, including the PaX and Exec Shield patches for Linux, and NetBSD's implementation of PaX. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and automatically CentOS) version 5, or by Linux Kernel 2.6.18-8, SELinux received the , , and policies that provide W^X when disabled. Although W^X (or DEP) has only protected userland programs for most of its existence, in 2012 Microsoft extended it to the Windows kernel on the x86 and ARM architectures. In late 2014 and early 2015, W^X was added in the OpenBSD kernel on the AMD64 architecture. In early 2016, W^X was fully implemented on NetBSD's AMD64 kernel and partially on the i386 kernel. Starting with Firefox 46 in 2016, Firefox's virtual machine for JavaScript also implements the W^X policy.

It provided space for 840 residents in a co-operative living space. It was also a free university where students and teachers would live together and share knowledge. The project ultimately failed when it could not cover its financing and neighbours complained that it had become a haven for drugs and crime. It was closed in 1975.  Co-operative housing experiment  Rochdale was the largest co-op residence in North America, occupying an 18-storey student residence at Bloor St. and Huron St. in downtown Toronto. It was situated on the edges of the University of Toronto campus, near to Yorkville, Toronto's hippie haven in the 1960s and early 1970s. The college took its name from Rochdale, a town in north-west England, where the world's first cooperative society was established in 1844. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers is usually considered the first successful co-operative enterprise, used as a model for modern co-ops, following the 'Rochdale Principles'. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over 1,000 co-operative societies in the United Kingdom. The college's modern architecture was uniquely designed for communal living. Some areas were divided into independently operated communal units of about a dozen bedrooms (called ashrams), each with its own collective washroom, kitchen and dining room. Each unit was responsible for collecting rent and maintaining its own housekeeping. Other areas consisted of bachelor, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments. On the first and second floor were common areas used for socialization, education, and commercial purposes. The roof was accessible from the 18th floor and was used for sunbathing. Clothing was optional.  Founding  Rochdale began as a response to a growing need for student housing at the University of Toronto, and a nineteen-year-old entrepreneur and philosophy student, Howard Adelman, was hired by the Campus Co-operative to meet the housing demand in 1958.Mietkiewicz, p. 7. With Adelman's advice, Campus Co-op began to acquire more properties, and formed Campus Co-operative Residence Incorporated., a non-profit offshoot of Campus Co-op. After obtaining federal mortgages at well below the market rate, Campus Co-op incorporated Rochdale College in 1964.Mietkiewicz, p. 9. It was by accident rather than design that Rochdale became such a tall building. Campus Co-op preferred to have the building be built to two times coverage, which would have resulted in a relatively easily managed building whose floor area would be only twice the size of the lot.Mietkiewicz, p. 10. However, due to Rochdale's location on a busy arterial road, the site was zoned at seven times coverage.Mietkiewicz, p. 12. This meant an unanticipated jump to 840 residents, a fact that was originally greeted with great enthusiasm, due to the expansionist attitudes of the founders. Zoning regulations also stipulated that the site was to be an apartment-hotel, which meant that only half the floor space could be used for apartments with self-contained kitchens. This disadvantage was not fully appreciated due to faith in a communal system, in which residents would be expected to effectively share the space available to them. In addition, the west and east wings differed by planners‚Äô fiat in matters of self-containment and density of intended occupation. The west wing attracted a population that was relatively stable, an attraction helped by one-year leases, while the east wing attracted more transient tenants. The west-wing units were more in demand, not surprisingly when the rent structure in the first years gave an Aphrodite for two at $135 a month in the west wing and a Gnostic for two, with less space, at $200 a month in the east. With this rent structure, for some time the east wing subsidized the ‚Äúlanded gentry‚Äù in the west. The west wing with its self-contained units [the apartments] tended to stay aloof from the east wing [the hotel], and east-wing residents often were uninterested in the operations of the College. In a symbolic rather than a practical sense, a visible seal was put on this east-west division by a fire door that split the floors in half.Sharpe, p. 31 (1987), p. 36 (2019). Campus Co-op, the parent corporation of Rochdale College, was uncomfortable with education taking a central role at Rochdale, a position held strongly by Rochdale's intellectual leaders such as Dennis Lee.Mietkiewicz, p. 17. A decision was made to separate from Campus Co-op. Further emphasis was placed on education when Adelman noted that the college's $175,000 property tax could be avoided if they had a functioning educational program.Mietkiewicz, p. 20. In Adelman's words, if \\"we run an education program for $75,000, we'll come out $100,000 ahead.\\" Although many Rochdale founders viewed its education program as a form of tax avoidance, those who were dedicated to Rochdale as an educational institution did not let that deter them from pursuing what they viewed as a more noble purpose. Dennis Lee, the creative talent of the operation, notes plans like the tax avoidance scheme were, \\"primarily in the thinking of people like Howard who were involved in the planning, they did a good job of keeping their cards fairly close to their chest. It was not something that was being passed around generally, [...] it would have made other people completely furious to hear it at the time.\\" Yet it would be inaccurate to conclude that Adelman, the organizational talent of the operation, did not share its educational goals. With Lee, Adelman edited a collection of articles published in 1968 that constituted a manifesto of sorts for \\"free university\\" education, calling for liberation from inhibiting educational institutions. Adelman's contribution was a particularly scathing indictment of the modern university as an institution that stifles innovation and serves only the establishment.Adelman & Lee, pp. 147-172. Even before its construction, there was a tension in Rochdale between fiscal responsibility and idealism. Mietkiewicz writes, \\"[p]erhaps because of their idealistic preoccupations, few of Rochdale's academic leaders were fully aware that much of Campus Co-op's enthusiasm for education had stemmed from its vision of the program as a sort of tax dodge.\\"  Transition  The originally intended tenants for Rochdale were screened.Mietkiewicz, p. 21. Screenings were handled by residents of the Rochdale Houses, a precursor \\"dry-run\\" to Rochdale conducted at Campus Co-op owned houses, and they chose people who were by and large going to be associated with the University of Toronto. However, a construction strike in 1967 that delayed the opening of Rochdale by half a year changed Rochdale's population from what was supposed to be a carefully selected one to a completely random one.Mietkiewicz, p. 22. The screened applicants, most of whom had commitments to the university, could not wait for Rochdale to be completed and many found new accommodations. The simple fact that the building was still in some ways a construction site may have deterred many of the students who were attracted to the idea of the hip, alternative education envisioned by its founders, torpedoing the raison d‚Äô√™tre for the enterprise on day one. [In contrast,] Toronto‚Äôs hippies were undeterred by the dust and debris. Following the month-long hepatitis scare that had swept through their nearby Yorkville scene and looking towards the long winter to come, they weren‚Äôt exactly picky. They poured into this apparent haven by the hundreds.Henderson, p. 10. When the college was slowly completed floor by floor, a practical decision was made to make the building available to \\"people who walked in right off the street.\\" As the small group of founders later stated: \\"[w]e were sealing the fate of the Rochdale that most of us had wanted to experiment with. And since there were very few rules about how the place would be run, we were in effect handing the building over to people very unlike ourselves.\\"Mietkiewicz, p. 29. \\"If the new residents were a problem to the resource people, non-residents were a problem to everyone,\\" says Sharpe. \\"As Rochdalians claimed floor by floor in the fall of 1968, transients discovered wide open areas on the upper floors and moved in ‚Äì and out and in and out. As those areas became permanently occupied, the transients continued to wander and squat and wander again. Meanwhile, word of mouth, word of press, called out: A free college! A college so unlicensed that it offers, not freedom or license, but both. Freedom from parents, freedom from rent, freedom even from an address. Thousands of visitors and interim residents came from the roads and the suburbs.Sharpe, p. 43 (1987), p. 48 (2019). Metro had a little school Its name was black as sin And day and night the Metro kids Were screaming to get in.\\" (Rochdale Daily)Sharpe, p. 43 (1987), p. 48 (2019).  Educational ideals  In the late 1960s, universities were centres of political idealism and experimentation. Rochdale College was established as an alternative to what were considered traditional paternalistic and non- democratic governing bodies within university education. Conversely, Rochdale's government policy was decided at open meetings in which all members of the co-operative could attend, participate in debate, and engage in consensus decision making. It was the largest of more than 300 tuition-free universities in North America, and offered no structured courses, curriculum, exams, degrees, or traditional teaching faculty. From humble beginnings in seminars on phenomenology and a Recorder Consort that performed with the London (Ontario) Symphony Orchestra, it became a hot bed of freethought and radical idealism. Rochdale College never used traditional professors or structured classes. Posting notices on bulletin boards and in a student newsletter, groups of students coalesced around an interest, and \\"resource people\\" were found with various academic and non-academic backgrounds, who led informal discussion groups on a wide variety of subjects. Resource persons of note included an Anglican priest, Alderman and later Member of Parliament, Dan Heap, author Dennis Lee and Futurian Judith Merril, who founded Rochdale's library.In Merril & Pohl-Weary (2002) Rochdale participants were involved with various cultural institutions in Toronto such as Coach House Press, Theatre Passe Muraille, The Toronto Free Dance Theatre, This Magazine is About Schools (now This Magazine), the Spaced-out Library (now the Merril Collection of the Toronto Public Library) and House of Anansi Press. Rochdale's co-op daycare Acorn (which was relocated from the Rochdale site to the basement of nearby St. Thomas Church) lives on today as Huron Playschool Cooperative. Students had complete freedom to develop their own learning process, much of which emerged from the shared community experience. The college included theatres for drama and film, and a ceramics studio. Students decided school policy and made their own evaluations. It was typical of the free universities not to award degrees and the University of Toronto did not offer degrees through Rochdale College. Indicative of the playful humour of the times, anyone could purchase a B.A. by donating $25 to the college and answering a simple skill- testing question. An M.A. cost $50, with the applicant choosing the question. A Ph.D. cost $100, no questions asked. The Rochdale application also described its \\"non-degree\\": \\"We are also offering Non-Degrees at comparable rates. A Non-B.A. is $25.00. Course duration is your choice; requirements are simple, we ask that you say something. A Non-M.A. is $50.00 for which we require you to say something logical. A Non-Ph.D. is $100.00; you will be required to say something useful.\\" Nobody at Rochdale ever took these degrees seriously, and the fees (if any were collected) were treated as voluntary donations. \\"1970‚Äì73 is the period that has always interested observers of the College most,\\" Henderson writes, \\"[filled with] sustained attempts at building the truly functional alternative social structures, communities, and facilities that characterized the period. Residents, realizing that they were edging towards a kind of separate society right there in the building, founded a health clinic (where babies were born!), a library, a range of food services, a child care centre, an in-house radio and TV station, a vibrant newspaper, and a series of floor-wide communes.\\"Henderson, p. 11. Its own pirate radio station was called CRUD, with an unusual assortment of music, talk, and static. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission tried to shut the station down a number of times, but the dedication of its staff kept it on the air. Rochdale had a large cafeteria and a ground-floor restaurant open to the public. It had a health-food store, a laundromat on the roof, a day-care, a free school called Superschool where the kids designed their own curriculum, and a medical clinic run by an RN. \\"It is often claimed,\\" says Henderson, \\"that some inhabitants didn‚Äôt go outside for weeks and months at a stretch, since they could access everything they needed right within the building.\\"Henderson, p. 11.  Drug culture  Rochdale was originally a refuge for idealists. Ultimately, the constituents of its cooperative idealism were its downfall. Dedicated to consensus decision making and granting a vote to everyone who lived (or claimed to live) in the building, Rochdale's governing body was unable to reach agreement to expel those who failed to pay their rents or otherwise live up to its ideals. Unable to pay its mortgage to the Canadian government, Rochdale drifted towards insolvency. As nearby Yorkville became gentrified during the late 1960s, much of Toronto's counterculture moved into Rochdale. This included homeless squatters and bikers who dealt hard drugs, along with a substantial number of undercover officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Judith Merril, librarian at Rochdale during the early 1970s, reported that Robert MacDonald, an employee of the Addiction Research Foundation, maintained a presence at Rochdale and actively collected samples of the available drugs, which were lab tested for toxicity and the results made available to Rochdale residents. According to the CBC Archives, by 1971 Rochdale had become known as \\"'North America's largest drug distribution warehouse.' Hash, pot, and LSD are in large supply. The Rochdale security force includes members of biker gangs\\" Hiring the bikers for security in late 1971 was the beginning of the end. Until then there was a strict unwritten code that no one sold hard drugs out of Rochdale. CBC Archives also describe how \\"[d]ue to problems with cops and bikers, the governing council set up a paid security force to be on 24-hour alert. Ironically, some of these security people were bikers themselves. As had happened in Yorkville, an unofficial alliance with the Vagabonds outlaw motorcycle club developed.\\" Rochdale's educational focus and student population declined as the drug business increased. After increased clashes with police, and unable to pay its mortgage, political pressure forced financial foreclosure by the government, and Rochdale closed in 1975. A number of residents refused to leave. On 30 May the last residents were carried from the building by police. The doors to the college had to be welded shut to keep them out. \\"When it was clear that the game was up,\\" writes Sharpe, \\"Rochdale published its own wry comment: 'Drugdealing is now the domain of the professionals, i.e. lawyers, doctors, etc. Let's hope they never get to live in the same building.'\\"Sharpe, p. 277 (1987), p. 316 (2019).  The building  The Unknown Student sculpture in front of the Rochdale building on Bloor St. The 18-storey tower that once housed Rochdale at 341 Bloor Street is now known as the Senator David A. Croll Apartments. Completed in 1968, it is the sister building to the Tartu student residence a short distance west across Bloor street. Designed by the architects Elmar Tamp√µld and John Wells (who had earlier constructed the Charles Street Apartments at Bay Street and Bloor Street). As homage to its Rochdale days, the tower features the large Unknown Student sculpture out front.  In retrospect  \\"Love it or loathe it, Rochdale College is hard to dismiss even 20 years after its closing.\\" (University of Toronto Magazine, Spring, 1995, p. 38.) \\"At its best,\\" Sharpe writes, \\"Rochdale was a noble experiment. It tested new approaches to education, creativity, and community, and like the testing of new products in industry, the limits of a new product cannot be known until the point of destruction is reached. This product of the Sixties -- the mix of ideals and attitudes that Rochdale concentrated from the surrounding youth culture -- had to be dropped from a height, pounded, stretched, and put under heat. The accomplishment of Rochdale cannot be separated from its eventual destruction, and an institution that was not allowed to be self-destructive about such sweeping questions would have tested nothing at all.\\"Sharpe, p. 275 (1987), p. 314 (2019). Judith Merril writes, comparing University of Toronto's nearby Ontario Institute for Studies in Education with Rochdale: \\"At OISE, as at Rochdale, ninety-nine starts out of a hundred are false ones. At OISE, of course, they have to keep records of all that money, so they know what they've tried that didn't work, and maybe why, and maybe what to try next. At Rochdale, they have to keep trying the same inexpensive things over and over, because they have no money and no records -- and sometimes something works after a while. Which way is worse?\\" See also *The National Film Board of Canada documentary \`Dream Tower\` (1994) directed by Ron Mann, documents Rochdale College, a controversial experiment combining free university and student residence. *Ken Westerfield 1971-2 resident and disc sports pioneer.

He is the former founder of Wizards Futbol Club, a youth soccer academy. Career Burciaga played youth soccer for the Dallas Texans Soccer Club and graduated from Duncanville High School where he was the 2000 District 7 soccer MVP and two-time All State. Instead of attending college, Burciaga opted to turn professional after finishing high school, signing a Project-40 contract with MLS. Burciaga was selected 12th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. Although a star with United States youth national teams, he was not immediately ready for MLS. He played two games on loan to the Portland Timbers of the USL A-League. He also played three games for Project 40 and one game with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in an August 2001 U.S. Open Cup game. He finished the season with the Wizards with three games, two of them starts. Burciaga tore his left knee's ACL in preseason and missed the entire 2002 season rehabbing the injury. He came on strong in 2003, earning the left back starting position in preseason and looking poised to finally come into his own; he tore his right knee's ACL in the fourth game of the season and so finished the year with only those four starts. After two painful years, Burciaga returned to the Wizards' lineup in 2004 and was injury-free for the entire year. Given the opportunity, he seized the left back position and kept it all year long. He finished the season with 21 starts out of 24 games played, and added one goal and one assist. In 2005, Burciaga was selected out of all the MLS players to the MLS Select team vs. Real Madrid at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu for the Trofeo Bernabeu. 2006 was Burciaga's breakout year, as he scored 8 goals and 8 assists, several of them spectacular, in earning MLS Best XI honors for the first time and team MVP. Burciaga was traded by the Kansas City Wizards to league rivals Colorado Rapids on January 16, 2008, in return for a 2009 second round 2009 MLS SuperDraft pick. Colorado opted not to renew his contract for the 2009 season. Burciaga trialed with Orlando City during the 2011 preseason but was not offered a contract with the team. In the spring of 2012, Burciaga attempted to earn a roster spot with MLS side D.C. United but was not successful. He ended up playing in 2012 for the Atlanta Silverbacks of the second division NASL. Burciaga returned to professional soccer in late 2018, signing with the Major Arena Soccer League's Dallas Sidekicks. Jose Burciaga Jr. Academy In 2002, Burciaga founded the Wizards Futbol Club in Dallas, Texas. Established by Jose Luis Burciaga Sr. and Jose Luis Burciaga Jr., Wizards FC is a community based not for profit organization designed to provide a high level of training and development that will prepare all players for college and beyond. At the 2014 Dallas Cup, Wizards FC had two teams participating with one team going to the finals. =Partnership= On August 4, 2014, Wolverhampton Wanderers of England agreed to a partnership with Wizards FC. Wizards FC coaches and players will have the opportunity to work with the Academy coaches of Wolves in both North America and England, offering an insight into the player development program of one of the top English soccer academies. The partnership will provide players and coaches access to a club renowned for producing world class players. The partnership will see the Wolves North American Academy hosting a series of Elite Player ID events with Wizards FC. Wolves will send Academy staff members over to work with Wizards FC players at these events. The best male and female players at these events will be invited to attend the Wolves National Camp. The National Camp will host the top players from each of partner club in North America. From the National Camp, the top players will be invited to attend the Elite Player Tour at Wolves' Academy in Wolverhampton, England. Jose Luis Burciaga Jr. stated that: ‚ÄúWe are excited about our new partnership with Wolves, and we are looking forward to working together to help develop our young players to become the next generation of soccer players.

Logically, the page may be accessible to the process, but requires a mapping to be added to the process page tables, and may additionally require the actual page contents to be loaded from a backing store such as a disk. The processor's MMU detects the page fault, while the exception handling software that handles page faults is generally a part of the operating system kernel. When handling a page fault, the operating system tries to make the required page accessible at the location in physical memory or terminates the program in cases of an illegal memory access. Contrary to what \\"fault\\" might suggest, valid page faults are not errors, and are common and necessary to increase the amount of memory available to programs in any operating system that utilizes virtual memory, including OpenVMS, Microsoft Windows, Unix-like systems (including macOS, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX), and z/OS.  Types  = Minor = If the page is loaded in memory at the time the fault is generated, but is not marked in the memory management unit as being loaded in memory, then it is called a minor or soft page fault. The page fault handler in the operating system merely needs to make the entry for that page in the memory management unit point to the page in memory and indicate that the page is loaded in memory; it does not need to read the page into memory. This could happen if the memory is shared by different programs and the page is already brought into memory for other programs. The page could also have been removed from the working set of a process, but not yet written to disk or erased, such as in operating systems that use Secondary Page Caching. For example, HP OpenVMS may remove a page that does not need to be written to disk (if it has remained unchanged since it was last read from disk, for example) and place it on a Free Page List if the working set is deemed too large. However, the page contents are not overwritten until the page is assigned elsewhere, meaning it is still available if it is referenced by the original process before being allocated. Since these faults do not involve disk latency, they are faster and less expensive than major page faults. = Major = This is the mechanism used by an operating system to increase the amount of program memory available on demand. The operating system delays loading parts of the program from disk until the program attempts to use it and the page fault is generated. If the page is not loaded in memory at the time of the fault, then it is called a major or hard page fault. The page fault handler in the OS needs to find a free location: either a free page in memory, or a non-free page in memory. This latter might be used by another process, in which case the OS needs to write out the data in that page (if it has not been written out since it was last modified) and mark that page as not being loaded in memory in its process page table. Once the space has been made available, the OS can read the data for the new page into memory, add an entry to its location in the memory management unit, and indicate that the page is loaded. Thus major faults are more expensive than minor faults and add storage access latency to the interrupted program's execution. = Invalid = If a page fault occurs for a reference to an address that is not part of the virtual address space, meaning there cannot be a page in memory corresponding to it, then it is called an invalid page fault. The page fault handler in the operating system will then generally pass a segmentation fault to the offending process, indicating that the access was invalid; this usually results in abnormal termination of the code that made the invalid reference. A null pointer is usually represented as a pointer to address 0 in the address space; many operating systems set up the MMU to indicate that the page that contains that address is not in memory, and do not include that page in the virtual address space, so that attempts to read or write the memory referenced by a null pointer get an invalid page fault.  Invalid conditions  Illegal accesses and invalid page faults, as invalid conditions, can result in a segmentation fault or bus error, resulting in programming termination (crash) or core dump, depending on the operating system environment. Often these problems are caused by software bugs, but hardware memory errors, such as those caused by overclocking, may corrupt pointers and make correct software fail. It can also crash the operating system. Operating systems such as Windows and UNIX (and other UNIX-like systems) provide differing mechanisms for reporting errors caused by page faults. Windows uses structured exception handling to report page fault-based invalid accesses as access violation exceptions, and UNIX (and UNIX-like) systems typically use signals, such as SIGSEGV, to report these error conditions to programs. If the program receiving the error does not handle it, the operating system performs a default action, typically involving the termination of the running process that caused the error condition, and notifying the user that the program has malfunctioned. Recent versions of Windows often report such problems by simply stating something like \\"this program must close\\" (an experienced user or programmer with access to a debugger can still retrieve detailed information). Recent Windows versions also write a minidump (similar in principle to a core dump) describing the state of the crashed process. UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems report these conditions to the user with error messages such as \\"segmentation violation\\", or \\"bus error\\", and may also produce a core dump.  Performance impact  Page faults, by their very nature, degrade the performance of a program or operating system and in the degenerate case can cause thrashing. Optimization of programs and the operating system that reduce the number of page faults improve the performance of the program or even the entire system. The two primary focuses of the optimization effort are reducing overall memory usage and improving memory locality. To reduce the page faults in the system, programmers must make use of an appropriate page replacement algorithm that suits the current requirements and maximizes the page hits. Many have been proposed, such as implementing heuristic algorithms to reduce the incidence of page faults. Generally, making more physical memory available also reduces page faults. Major page faults on conventional computers using hard disk drives for storage can have a significant impact on performance, as an average hard disk drive has an average rotational latency of 3 ms, a seek time of 5 ms, and a transfer time of 0.05 ms/page. Therefore, the total time for paging is near 8 ms (= 8,000 Œºs). If the memory access time is 0.2 Œºs, then the page fault would make the operation about 40,000 times slower.

Starring Robin Williams, Edward Norton, DeVito, Catherine Keener and Jon Stewart, the film centers on \\"Rainbow\\" Randolph Smiley (Williams), a disgraced former children's TV host who attempts to sabotage his replacement, Sheldon Mopes, and his character, Smoochy the Rhino (Norton). Produced by Film4 Productions and Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance Productions, Death to Smoochy was released in the United States on March 29, 2002 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film met with mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and was a huge box office bomb, grossing only $8.3 million against a budget of $50 million. Despite this, in recent years it has garnered a cult following.  Plot  Randolph \\"Rainbow Randolph\\" Smiley is the host of \\"The Rainbow Randolph Show\\", a popular children's TV show that is frequently broadcast on the kids' TV channel Kidnet. Despite his friendly and playful appearance on-stage in the TV studio, off-stage in reality, he is actually an alcoholic and corrupt businessman who secretly accepts bribes from parents who want to put their kids on his show. After an FBI sting exposes him, Randolph is fired, and his show is canceled. He is promptly replaced with the \\"squeaky clean\\" Sheldon Mopes and his character Smoochy the Rhino, who is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality children's entertainment, and despite doubts from his hardened producer Nora Wells, his show quickly becomes tremendously popular. Meanwhile, Randolph turns to his former associate Marion Stokes and pleads to help him get his job back, but he refuses. After several attempts to get Sheldon fired, Randolph turns to his former partner Angelo Pike and asks if he can stay at his apartment, to which Angelo reluctantly agrees. Sheldon quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to Nora and with the help of his new corrupt agent Burke Bennett, Sheldon renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer. Later, Irish mob boss Tommy Cotter approaches Sheldon and asks him to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner Dunn, a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with brain damage. Sheldon reluctantly adds Spinner to the show, first as a cowbell-wielding game warden and later on as Smoochy's cousin Moochy. Sheldon is horrified to learn that Burke has signed him up to star in a Smoochy ice show, as he fears that the event will exploit children. Burke and Merv Green, the head of the corrupt charity running the ice show, warn Sheldon not to back out of the event, but he does so anyway. Soon afterward, a disguised Randolph tricks Sheldon into performing a Smoochy act at a Neo-Nazi rally as a result of which Sheldon is branded a racist and loses his job and show, and Nora even refuses to help him. However, Randolph's victory is cut short when, after he barges into Nora's apartment and attempts to convince her to help him get his job back, he accidentally reveals that he set Sheldon up. Tommy and her crew barge into Angelo's apartment and force Randolph to confess that he tricked Sheldon. As a result, Sheldon's show is restored and Randolph is dubbed the most hated man in America by the media. To make matters worse, a fed up Angelo kicks Randolph out of his house. After telling him that his show is back on the air, Nora kisses Sheldon and the two have sex. Sheldon decides to perform in the ice show, but without the corrupt charities. Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Sheldon and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. However, their plan backfires when, during a rehearsal, Merv's men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Sheldon and murder him. When Tommy gets word of this, she retaliates by killing Merv and his men. Meanwhile, Randolph confronts Sheldon and Nora in their apartment and reveals to Sheldon that Nora had affairs with numerous children's show hosts, including Randolph himself. Sheldon is brokenhearted by this, but Nora insists that she was young and foolish back then and she really has genuine feelings for him. The two manage to calm Randolph down and discover that he is depressed and genuinely misses entertaining children. Sheldon offers to let Randolph stay in his apartment until he recovers. Burke and Marion decide to partner up after hearing of Merv's death. Burke hires Buggy Ding Dong, another former kid's show host, to assassinate Sheldon during his ice show. Buggy steals a backstage pass to get inside, but before he can shoot Sheldon, he is confronted by Randolph. They struggle for the rifle until Buggy falls to his death in the ice rink. After Sheldon realizes that Burke and Marion set him up, he pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke. Tommy and her men then arrive and persuade him not to forfeit his high ideals. Tommy decides to take care of Burke and Marion in her own way (murdering them offscreen, in a deleted scene), Sheldon and Nora share a kiss in Times Square, and Smoochy and Randolph launch a new show together alongside Nora, who becomes an ice skater.

In the original screenplay, the Smoochy costume was originally orange. However in the final film, the costume was chose pink instead. =Filming= Principal photography began in January 2001. Sequences were filmed in several locations in New York City such as Times Square, Coney Island, Upper West Side and Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. A brief shot of the North tower of the World Trade Center can be seen where Rainbow Randolph is dancing on the small bench in Duane Park. In the DVD commentary, Danny Devito says it was the only shot in the movie that was in. No changes were made after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. Filming production moved to Canada on spring 2001. The KidNet studios scenes were shot in several areas in Toronto. In the ice show scene with Smoochy and Rainbow, Robin‚Äôs stuntdouble Elvis Stojko choreographed some of the skating moves for Rainbow Randolph. Robin was off stage. Filming ended in May 2001.  Home media  The film was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002.  Reception  =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, Death to Smoochy holds an approval rating of 42% based on 120 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"The talent involved can't save a script that has nowhere to go with its promising premise.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film an extremely negative review (giving it half a star out of four), saying that \\"Only enormously talented people could have made Death to Smoochy. Those with lesser gifts would have lacked the nerve to make a film so bad, so miscalculated, so lacking any connection with any possible audience. To make a film this awful, you have to have enormous ambition and confidence, and dream big dreams.\\" He named the film the Worst of the Year.Ebert, Roger (2002-03-29). \\"Death to Smoochy\\" (film review). Chicago Sun-Times. 2013-04-05. Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave the film a negative review, saying that the film \\"pushes its dark, smart, clever, cynical, satirical, nasty, provocative and sarcastic instincts to the point of heavily diminished returns‚Äîto the point where the very amusing premise just isn't funny anymore.\\"https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/death-to-smoochy-1200550771/ Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"This black-comic assault on family entertainment is going to set a lot of teeth on edge‚ÄîIf only his (DeVito's) material were better this time.\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie- reviews/death-to-smoochy-118150/ Conversely, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice praised the film, saying that \\"Death to Smoochy is often very funny, but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito's misanthropic vision.\\" David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor called the film a \\"razor-sharp satire\\" and \\"the most refreshingly outrageous movie of the season.\\" =Box office= Though it received a wide release by playing in 2,164 theaters its opening weekend in the United States, the film was a box-office bomb after grossing only $4,266,463 its opening weekend and a mere $8,382,691 overall, with negligible box-office receipts outside the American/Canadian market. =Accolades= Robin Williams received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance as Randolph in this film, but 'lost' to Hayden Christensen for his performance in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones.

Part of Stockholm's city wall, dating from the early 16th century, was also found. In order to make the finds accessible to the general public, a planned subterranean garage had to give way to the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, which was inaugurated in 1986. Museum director Margareta Hallerdt created a visionary state-of-the-art museum, designed by artist Kerstin Rydh, that received both national and international acclaim and won the European Museum of the Year Award in 1986. The museum was closed from June 15, 2007 until early 2010 during the restoration of the bridge Norrbro. During this period, the exhibition was rebuilt while a minor temporary exhibition was available in Kulturhuset at Sergels torg. The museum enables visitors to experience medieval Stockholm, with its brick houses and booths, workshops, harbour and gallows. It relates the medieval history of the city from the 1250s to the 1520s. In 2010, to celebrate 800 years since the birth of Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm, the museum opened an exhibition with a reconstruction of his face. The Museum of Medieval Stockholm produces theme exhibitions with a medieval emphasis and arranges lectures, symposia and programmes. It engages in broad educational activities, in which children, youth and schools are a key target group. The museum has a shop that sells books relating to the Middle Ages, and also postcards and jewelry.

In total, twenty three Arndales have been built in the United Kingdom, and three in Australia. The first opened in Jarrow, County Durham, in 1961, as a pedestrianised shopping area. Arndale Luton was not the biggest covered shopping centre at any point. History The first Arndale Centre, in Jarrow, opened in 1961. It is now known as the Viking Centre. The Cross Gates Centre in Cross Gates, Leeds was an Arndale Centre until 2000. Shortly after the end of World War II, Arnold Hagenbach, a baker with a talent for property investment, and Sam Chippendale, an estate agent from Otley, set up a company called the Arndale Property Trust, the name being a portmanteau of \\"Arnold\\" and \\"Chippendale\\". The trust purchased Bradford's Victorian Swan Arcade in 1954, with the intention of demolishing it and developing a new shopping centre, but it took eight years before leases expired and building work could commence, so in the meantime it developed a site in Jarrow, County Durham, which became the first Arndale Centre when it opened in 1961. Its trademark Viking statue, built by the Trust, was unveiled on 17 February 1962. When the Wandsworth Arndale opened in 1971, it was the largest indoor shopping space in Europe. The largest Arndale Centre built was Manchester Arndale. It was redeveloped in 1996, after being badly damaged in an IRA bombing, and the centre has been owned by Prudential since December 1998. The centre suffered minor damage during the riots of August 2011. Criticism Arndale Centres attracted criticism on aesthetic grounds as they replaced old buildings ‚Äì often of the Victorian period ‚Äì with modern concrete constructions, often in a brutalist style. The value of the Wandsworth Arndale was maximised by the high rise tower blocks built on top of the mall, which helped it to become, according to some commentators, \\"one of London‚Äôs great architectural disasters\\".

United of Major League Soccer. Thompson played college soccer at Eastern Illinois University from 2000 to 2002. Thompson had a very strong start in his freshman year, surprising everybody by scoring 21 goals to lead the NCAA Division I, and was named the Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year and chosen for Soccer America's All-Freshman team. Thompson's next year was mediocre, due to injuries, as he scored only five goals. Thompson did significantly better in 2002, however, finishing the year with 14 goals and four assists, earning him a first-team All-Midwest selection. Because of his performances for the Under-23 United States Men's National Soccer Team, Thompson was offered a Nike Project-40 contract after his junior season, which he accepted. As well as still holding the school record for the most goals scored in a single season (21 goals in 2000), Thompson is also the record holder for most goals scored in a single game, when he scored six in a 2002 match up with the Belmont Bruins. Thompson was selected 15th overall, in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by his hometown Dallas Burn. Unfortunately, Thompson tore his ACL during the preseason while playing with the U-23 team, and missed all of the 2003 season. On returning in 2004, Thompson had trouble breaking into new coach Colin Clarke's veteran-dominated lineup and was traded to D.C. United. Competition among forwards was equally strong at D.C., however, and although Thompson played a target forward role unlike United's other strikers, he only made one appearance for the team, coming on as a substitute and played 60 minutes. D.C. United went on to win the 2004 MLS Cup with a 3‚Äì2 victory over Kansas City Wizards, at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. Thompson went on to play the entire 2005 season with D.C. United, one that saw United finish second in the Eastern Conference, before he was released into the waiver draft of that subsequent off-season. Thompson completed his Doctor of Medicine at The University of Texas School of Medicine at San Antonio. He is currently an Orthopedic Surgery Resident at The University of Texas School of Medicine at San Antonio. Once Thompson completed his residency in San Antonio he completed an additional year of fellowship in Canada focusing on orthopedic joints. There he specifically focused on the most complex hips and knee cases in North America. Now, Dr. Thompson is practicing orthopedics in Corpus Christi, TX with South Texas Bone and Joint where he has quickly become one of the busiest, leading and most well respected orthopedic joint doctors in South Texas.

It borders Purley, Coulsdon, Riddlesdown, Caterham and Whyteleafe. Kenley is situated 13 miles south of Charing Cross. The 2011 census showed Kenley having a population of 14,966. Significant portions of Kenley lie within the Metropolitan Green Belt. In particular, the south of Kenley is dominated by the open green spaces of Kenley Common and Kenley Aerodrome. History A comprehensive history of Kenley is found in the Bourne Society's 'Kenley Village History'. =Suburban development= For centuries, Kenley was part of Coulsdon Manor which covered the whole area now known as Coulsdon, Old Coulsdon, Purley and Kenley. As with most of this area, Kenley was primarily farm land, with a few big houses and their estates. The official opening of the railway on 4 August 1856 transformed Kenley. The new railway prompted urban development. By the end of the Victorian era, Kenley had assumed its own identity. Magnificent gentlemen's houses in substantial grounds were constructed during the 1860s. These houses gave Kenley its distinctive appearance on its western hillside. More modest housing and shops were built along the Godstone Road in the 1880s. Finally, the compact housing of the lower lying Roke area was constructed toward the end of the 19th century. All Saints' Church, now a Grade II listed building, was built in 1870, and enlarged in 1897 and 1902. In 1888, Kenley was created as a parish in its own right. One of Kenley's landmark buildings is the Memorial Hall. It was opened in 1922 to commemorate those who gave their lives in the First World War. It was subsequently extended and re-opened by Group Captain Douglas Bader in 1975. =Second World War= RAF Kenley was a strategic airfield in the Battle of Britain. Given RAF Kenley's importance, the Luftwaffe attempted to destroy it by means of a massive bombing raid on 18 August 1940. The attacking Luftwaffe aircraft suffered heavy casualties during the raid. Despite some damage to the airfield and the surrounding buildings and homes, this bombing raid proved unsuccessful. By the following day, RAF Kenley was operational again. Kenley airfield plays a unique and important role in Britain‚Äôs history. As the UK‚Äôs most complete surviving Battle of Britain fighter airfield, it gives us a direct and tangible link to our aviation past. As an active airfield today, it builds on that heritage, whilst the surrounding environs provide visitors with a site of nature conservation and a protected public open space. The National Lottery funded Kenley Revival Project enables people to connect with, and take ownership of, a vital part of British history. Hammond Innes' book Attack Alarm was based on his experiences as a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft gunner at RAF Kenley during the Battle of Britain. It contains graphic descriptions of the station and attacks on it in 1940. =Post-war development= In the post-war period, many of the substantial Victorian properties with their extensive grounds were developed for executive housing. In 1959, Kenley was closed as an operational base of the RAF. Today, the aerodrome is used exclusively by the gliders of the Air Training Corps (615 Volunteer Gliding Squadron) and the Surrey Hills Gliding Club. Kenley Common Kenley Common comprises 138 acres of green open space surrounding the former Battle of Britain airfield. It is a mixture of chalk grassland and ancient woodland set among gently rolling hills. Blessed with fine views across the Caterham valley and the North Downs beyond, visitors find it hard to believe that the centre of London is only 14 miles to the north. The original common was bought by the Corporation of London in 1883. At that time, it encompassed some of the area that is now Kenley Airfield. Over the years, compulsory purchases by the Government and subsequent land acquisitions and re-acquisitions have meant that the Common has changed its shape and position, and almost doubled in size. The common‚Äôs history as an airfield goes back to the First World War when planes were assembled and tested for squadrons in France. It proved an important link in the chain of supply and became established as a permanent Royal Air Force station. The Second World War saw concrete runways being laid and, as headquarters of ‚ÄòB‚Äô Sector in the No 11 Group of fighter stations, it was soon playing a key role in the Battle of Britain. Kenley is now the last remaining Battle of Britain fighter station in the southeast to remain in its Second World War form. Evidence of its wartime role has survived and the old blast bays, air raid shelters, officer‚Äôs mess and the original runways can still be seen. English Heritage identified Kenley as the \\"most complete fighter airfield associated with the Battle of Britain to have survived\\". Demography The Kenley ward was 70% White British in the 2011 census. Politics Kenley is located in the Parliamentary constituency of Croydon South where the current MP as of October 2020 has been Chris Philp of the Conservative Party. He was re-elected with 30,985 votes at the 2019 General Election. At a local level, Kenley has three Conservative councilors on Croydon Borough Council. Boundary changes at the 2018 Local Elections saw the number of Councillors reduced from three to two.

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the north, Jerome Avenue to the east, Macombs Dam Bridge to the south, and the Harlem River to the west. Ogden Avenue is the primary thoroughfare through Highbridge. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 4, and its ZIP Code is 10452. The local subway is the IND Concourse Line (), operating along the Grand Concourse, and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (), operating along Jerome Avenue. The area is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 44th Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx. History High Bridge, part of the old Croton Aqueduct At the time of European settlement, the southern Bronx was inhabited by the Siwanoy, a tribe of the Wappinger Confederacy. They called the hill that is now Highbridge \\"Nuasin,\\" or \\"the land between,\\" for its location between the Harlem River and an estuary that formerly flowed in the area of modern-day Jerome Avenue. The neighborhood takes its name from the High Bridge built in 1848 by Irish immigrants to carry Croton Aqueduct water across the Harlem River. In the mid-late 19th century, the area was developed as a suburban retreat for the elite, who built large homes overlooking the Harlem River. The names of these families and their estates are still reflected in the names of Highbridge's north-south avenues: Ogden Avenue and Boscobel Place for William B. Ogden, Merriam Avenue for Francis W. Merriam, Anderson Avenue and Woodycrest Avenue for the Anderson family, and Shakespeare Avenue for the Shakespeare Garden on the Marcher family estate. Around the turn of the 20th Century, many of these estates were subdivided for urban development, however a few older houses still remain. In the early 20th Century, the neighborhood was served by the Anderson‚ÄìJerome Avenues station, which connected the New York City Subway's Ninth Avenue elevated Line with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line ().

McVitie lived nearby in a flat at 76 Broughton Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1870 Robert retired in 1880 and died in 1884 leaving his eldest son Robert McVitie (1854-1910) to run the business. It was only then that the business abandoned bread and cakes to concentrate on biscuits, largely due to their longer lifespan. In 1887 he employed Alexander Grant from Forres, an experienced biscuit maker, to aid in this. He was employed as foreman of the bakery but left to set up his own bakery in Inverness but this failed and he returned to McVitie;s. In 1875 the company had been joined by Charles Edward Price as a salesman. His success in this role led to a partnership in 1888 to create McVitie & Price. In 1888 they built the huge St Andrews Biscuit Works on Robertson Avenue in the Gorgie district of south-west Edinburgh. Price left in 1910 following the death of Robert. In 1891 the London salesman for the company George Andrews Brown persuaded the company to redesign their Rich Tea biscuit to a smaller size to accommodate the London taste. In 1898 McVitie rebranded the company McVities Guest after joining with his brother-in-law Edward Graham Guest.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/MacVitties,_Guest_and_Co In 1903 they built the renowned McVities Guest Tearoom at 135/136 Princes Street.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=202265 The original Gorgie factory burned down in 1894, but was rebuilt the same year to a much improved technical standard. It remained operative until 1969, when production ceased and operations were transferred to the English sites which had been established at Harlesden in 1901 and Manchester in 1917. Robert McVitie died married but childless in 1910 in Berkhamsted rather than at his home 12 Greenhill Gardens in south Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1909 He is memorialised in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. Prior to death he set up the company (retaining the name McVitie's) as a limited company placing Alexander Grant as managing director and principal share-holder.Made in Scotland, Carol Foreman The firm acquired the Edinburgh bakery of Simon Henderson & Sons in 1922. McVitie & Price merged with another Scottish bakery company, Macfarlane, Lang & Co., Ltd, in 1948 to become United Biscuits Group. McVitie's brand products are now manufactured in five United Kingdom factories: the two former McVitie & Price factories in Harlesden and Manchester, a former Macfarlane, Lang & Co. factory named Victoria Biscuit Works in Glasgow, a former Carr's factory named The Biscuit Works established 1831 in Carlisle, and the McVitie's Cake Co. factory (formerly Riley's Toffee Works) in Halifax. McVitie's chocolate digestive. First produced in 1925, travel writer Bill Bryson called it a ‚ÄúBritish masterpiece‚Äù. It is the most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea. McVitie & Price's first major biscuit was the McVitie's Digestive, created in 1892 by a new young employee at the company named Alexander Grant. The biscuit was given its name because it was thought that its high baking soda content served as an aid to food digestion. Grant was later to become managing director of the company. In 1923 he was the main benefactor in the establishing the National Library of Scotland giving an endowment of ¬£100,000. Grant donated a further ¬£100,000 in 1928 to assist with the building of the National Library premises on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh.Macmillan, p.238-52 In 1924 Ramsay MacDonald, prime minister of Britain‚Äôs new Labour Government, admitted that Grant had given him a Daimler car and ¬£30 000 of shares in the McVitie and Price company. Grant had been MacDonald‚Äôs childhood friend, and shortly after received a baronetcy (hereditary knighthood) from the prime minister. The affair, regarded by many as corruption by the prime minister, severely shook the government.William D Rubinstein 'Twentieth-Century Britain: A Political History', Palgrave, 2003 p146. The McVitie's Chocolate Homewheat Digestive was created in 1925. Over 71 million packets of McVitie's chocolate digestives are eaten in the United Kingdom each year, equating to 52 biscuits per second. HobNobs were launched in 1985 and a milk chocolate variant followed in 1987.

The Daily Telegraph (London). 2 May 2009 In March 2011, it was announced that Prince William had chosen a groom's cake for his wedding reception, made from 1,700 McVitie's Rich tea biscuits and of chocolate. In June 2014, McVitie's announced their intention to make 157 shop floor roles redundant at their Manchester manufacturing facility. This redundancy announcement was also due to the modernisation agenda of the company and also involves a move from an 8-hour 5 day operation, to a 12-hour 7 day operation. In November 2014, United Biscuits, and hence also McVitie's, became owned by Turkish company Yildiz which in 2016 merged some of its subsidiaries including United Biscuits as pladis (see United Biscuits). Wedding Cakes Although not their core operation it is noteworthy that McVitie's were commissioned in 1893 to create a wedding cake for the royal wedding between the Duke of York and Princess Mary, who subsequently became King George V and Queen Mary. This cake was over 2 metres high and cost 140 guineas. It was viewed by 14,000 and was a wonderful publicity for the company. They received many commissions for royal wedding cakes and christening cakes.Made in Scotland, Carol Foreman Similarly, McVitie's were commissioned to make a chocolate biscuit cake as a groom's cake for the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011.

Developed by Palestinian farmers in the mid-19th century, the variety takes its name from the city of Jaffa where it was first produced for export. The orange was the primary citrus export for the city. It is, along with the navel and bitter orange, one of three main varieties of the fruit grown in the Mediterranean, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. The Jaffa is also cultivated in Cyprus, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Turkey.Ladaniya, 2008, pp. 48‚Äì49. Production of Jaffa oranges are much lower today than in the past; historically they were considered the most famous export in the early state of Israel.  Characteristics  'Jaffa' oranges, also known as shamouti, are practically seedless, with a flavour that has been described as \\"excellent\\" and \\"sweet and fine.\\"Page, 2008, p. 99. The two other main orange varieties cultivated in the region are the navel orange and the bitter orange; the latter is grown in Iran for its peel. The 'Jaffa' orange is distinguished by its oval shape and thick peel, which is deep orange in color and normally very easy to remove from the fruit. Its tough skin makes it \\"especially suitable for export\\".Kr√§mer, 2008, p. 91. As it produces very little juice and has a tendency towards delayed bitterness, it is unsuitable for juice production, although it does store well. These oranges are very cold-tolerant, allowing them to grow outside of the subtropical regions normally associated with growing oranges. 'Jaffa' oranges are susceptible to Alternaria, a type of fungus, and are prone to alternate bearing.  History  1841 map of Jaffa showing orange plantations Orange groves at Bir Salim Located at the crossroads between Africa, western Asia, and Europe, Palestine produced a number of commodities for export via imperial and global distribution networks throughout the late Turkish period (1200‚Äì1900 CE). Among these were soap, sugar, barley, oranges, and cotton. Though cotton left its mark throughout the region, the only commodity that remains a symbol of production in Palestine is the 'Jaffa' orange. The 'Jaffa' orange was a new variety developed by Arab farmers after emerging in the mid-19th century as a mutation on a tree of the 'Baladi' variety near the city of Jaffa.Basan, 2007, p. 83. While the sour orange (C. aurantium) was brought westward from China and India by local traders, who may have introduced it to Sicily and Spain, the 'Jaffa' orange was developed from the sweet orange (C. sinensis) which was brought from China to the Mediterranean region by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498. After the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), the most important innovation in local agriculture was the rapid expansion of citrus cultivation. Foremost among the varieties cultivated was the Jaffa (Shamouti) orange, and mention of it being exported to Europe first appears in British consular reports in the 1850s.Issawi, 2006, p. 127. One factor cited in the growth of the export market was the development of steamships in the first half of the 19th century, which enabled the export of oranges to the European markets in days rather than weeks.Gerber, 1982. Another reason cited for the growth of the industry was the relative lack of European control over the cultivation of oranges compared to cotton, formerly a primary commodity crop of Palestine, but outpaced by the Jaffa orange.LeVine, 2005, p. 272. Jaffa Orange brand from Sarona Exports grew from 200,000 oranges in 1845 to 38 million oranges by 1870. The citrus plantations of this time were primarily owned by wealthy Palestinian merchants and notables, rather than small farmers, as the fruits required large capital investments with no yield for several years. Fruits carrying the \\"Jaffa orange\\" label were first marketed by Sarona, a German Templer colony established in 1871. An 1872 account of Jaffa by a European traveller notes that, \\"Surrounding Jaffa are the orange gardens for which it is justly extolled, and which are a considerable source of wealth to the owners. The annual value of fruits grown in Jaffa was said to be 10,000 pounds.\\" In the 1880s, an American grower, H.S. Sanford, tried to cultivate the 'Jaffa' orange in Florida.Derr, 1989, p. 79. Crates of Jaffa oranges being ferried to a waiting freighter for export, circa 1930 The prosperity of the orange industry brought increased European interest and involvement in the development of 'Jaffa'. In 1902, a study of the growth of the orange industry by Zionist officials outlined the different Palestinian owners and their primary export markets as England, Turkey, Egypt and Austria-Hungary. While the traditional Arabic cultivation methods were considered \\"primitive,\\" an in- depth study of the financial expenditure involved reveals that they were ultimately more cost-efficient than the Zionist-European enterprises that followed them some two decades later.LeVine, 2005, p. 34. The Zionists who immigrated to Palestine introduced the advanced cultivation methods that spurred the 'Jaffa' orange industry. According to the Hope Simpson Enquiry of 1930, > \\"The cultivation of the orange, introduced by the Arabs before the > commencement of Jewish settlement, has developed to a very great extent in > consequence of that settlement. There is no doubt that the pitch of > perfection to which the technique of plantation and cultivation of the > orange and grapefruit have been brought in Palestine is due to the > scientific methods of the Jewish agriculturist.\\"The Hope Simpson Report at > UNISPAL. CHAPTER VIII. Agricultural Produce. (a) CITRUS CULTIVATION Packing oranges in Petah Tikva, 1938 Partnerships in growing and exporting these oranges was an example of Arab-Jewish cooperation despite rising political tensions. At the end of 1928, Jews owned 30,000 dunams of the country's 60,000 dunams of orange orchards. Whereas before World War I, the price of a dunam of land in a fruitful orange grove was 50-75 pounds sterling, by 1929, the same groves were selling for 150-200 pounds sterling. By 1939, Jewish-owned and Arab-owned orange orchards in Palestine covered , employed over 100,000 workers, and their produce was a primary export. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) citrus-growing declined, but recovered after the war with the vigorous assistance of the British Mandate authorities. Legacy Jaffa oranges are harvested in Israel and the Palestinian territories between November and March, with the marketing season beginning in September and extending through April. More than half the annual crop is exported, and Israel is a main provider of other citrus fruits to the European Union. In the 1950s and 1960s, Jaffa oranges became emblems of the Israeli state. A general decline in the importance of agriculture to the Israeli economy, extreme limits on available water resources, and the reliance on migrant laborers have reduced productivity.Marshall Cavendish, 2006, p. 938. Overshadowed by manufacturing industries, such as diamonds and precision instruments, Israel nonetheless continues to export a large number of citrus fruits to Europe.Issawi, 2006, p. 32.

The positions in space of the galaxies identified by the VIPERS survey. In astronomy, a redshift survey is a survey of a section of the sky to measure the redshift of astronomical objects: usually galaxies, but sometimes other objects such as galaxy clusters or quasars. Using Hubble's law, the redshift can be used to estimate the distance of an object from Earth. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure detailed statistical properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. In conjunction with observations of early structure in the cosmic microwave background, these results can place strong constraints on cosmological parameters such as the average matter density and the Hubble constant. Generally the construction of a redshift survey involves two phases: first the selected area of the sky is imaged with a wide-field telescope, then galaxies brighter than a defined limit are selected from the resulting images as non-pointlike objects; optionally, colour selection may also be used to assist discrimination between stars and galaxies. Secondly, the selected galaxies are observed by spectroscopy, most commonly at visible wavelengths, to measure the wavelengths of prominent spectral lines; comparing observed and laboratory wavelengths then gives the redshift for each galaxy. The Great Wall, a vast conglomeration of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large- scale structure that redshift surveys can detect. The first systematic redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey of around 2,200 galaxies, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. This was later extended to the CfA2 redshift survey of 15,000 galaxies, completed in the early 1990s. These early redshift surveys were limited in size by taking a spectrum for one galaxy at a time; from the 1990s, the development of fibre- optic spectrographs and multi-slit spectrographs enabled spectra for several hundred galaxies to be observed simultaneously, and much larger redshift surveys became feasible. Notable examples are the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (221,000 redshifts, completed 2002); the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (approximately 1 million redshifts by 2007) and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. At high redshift the largest current surveys are the DEEP2 Redshift Survey and the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS); these have around 50,000 redshifts each, and are mainly focused on galaxy evolution. ZFOURGE or the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey which aims to establish an observational benchmark of galaxy properties at redshift z > 1. The survey is using near-infrared FOURSTAR instrument on the Magellan Telescopes, surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS. Because of the demands on observing time required to obtain spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., redshifts determined directly from spectral features measured at high precision), a common alternative is to use photometric redshifts based on model fits to the brightnesses and colors of objects. Such \\"photo-z's\\" can be used in large surveys to estimate the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars, provided the galaxy types and colors are well understood in a particular redshift range. At present, the errors on photometric redshift measurements are significantly higher than those of spectroscopic redshifts, but future surveys (for example, the LSST) aim to significantly refine the technique.

The region around Die is known as the Diois. Die is best known for the Clairette de Die, a sparkling wine. It was a county in the High Middle Ages. It was once the see of a Roman Catholic diocese and its cathedral remains. Church of the town  Geography  Die is situated in a valley, surrounded by the Glandasse mountain (6,696 feet; 2,041 m), a massive and steep rocky barrier, which separates the area (Pays Diois) from the Vercors Plateau. The territory of the commune of Die is part of the regional natural park of these regions.  History  Clearly, there were inhabitants during the Neolithic age, this has been confirmed by Chanqueyras excavations. A big engraved standing stone and two small menhirs that are now in the Die museum were found near the wine cooperative, (these) also proved inhabitation in this area at that time. The remains of the final Bronze Age were discovered at La Roche De Marginal, for example, some shards have been found at Chandillon. A first agglomeration seems to have appeared at the beginning of the Roman era, on a little mountain pass overhanging the Dr√¥me, and the small valley of Meyrosse, at the crossroad between the valley and the path to Tri√®ves. There is much evidence of the extension of urbanisation during the 1st century.

It seems it will be named as a colony towards the end of the 2nd century or during the 3rd century because the town became an important centre of fertility goddess Cybele‚Äôs cult. While the Roman Empire was showing signs of weakness, between the years 285 and 305, a fortified wall was constructed around the town, protecting an urbanised surface of , this wall is slightly more than a mile long. During its construction, fragments of burial monuments were reused. Die had two main gates: to the west, the gate of Saint-Pierre (demolished in 1891) and to the east, the gate of Saint-Marcel. To go to Chichilliane, people would take the road near Grenoble, and cross the Glandasse mountain (south of Vercors). On this plateau were found stones from the quarry, extracted and brought to Die. The first certified bishop of the Ancient Diocese of Die was Nicaise in 325, the only Gallic church representative at the First Council of Nicaea. The diocese was later merged with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Valence in 1276, yet again separated at the end of the 17th century, before its suppression during the French Revolution. = Remains = The Die and Diois museum (Mus√©e de Die) in the centre of town shows the multiple and imposing remains of the Roman era, but also tells the story of the Diois during prehistory, the Middle-Ages of this episcopal city and the devastation caused by religious wars.  Population   Economy  Apart from agriculturalists and wine producers, the economy is still composed of many little companies, of craftsmen, of tourism providers and local retailers. Die is also the economic and social centre of all the Diois, it offers schools and professional centres. Public and administrative services also allow the well-being of this valley. =Tourism= The commune of Die is composed of less than 5000 inhabitants. The city concentrated on small industries, such as furniture and shoes during the 1960s and 1970s, and thus missed the opportunity of mass tourism. Nowadays, Die receives an important number of tourists during summer, from foreign countries such as The Netherlands and Belgium, making the most of camp sites around the Dr√¥me valley. On the contrary, in winter the tourists come from the surrounding regions to do winter sports at the Col du Rousset ski station (located in the Vercors Mountains). The most popular activities are: skiing (France‚Äôs Handisport Ski Championship), snowshoe hiking, sled dog racing (International competition of Alpirush). In 1992, it is here that the International Mountain Race Competition was won by a Columbian. =Agriculture= The cooperative winery Clairette de Die, which is the biggest Diois employer, had the idea a few years ago to adopt the brand name ‚Äújaillance‚Äù to be better known by the competing cooperative wineries, to be better identified by consumers and to optimise its power in sales and exports.

The headstone includes the quotation: \\"He is not the beginning but the continuing of the same unto the end.\\" A street in Stanley was named H Jones Road in his memory in addition to Jones Avenue in Mount Pleasant air base. A memorial stone to all those killed at the scene of the battle, near Darwin, also bears his name. His name is also on the South Atlantic Task Force Memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on the wall with the names of the fallen in the Falklands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College, and the Parachute Regiment Memorial at their headquarters in Aldershot; he also has a memorial in the cloisters of Eton College and a plaque on a footpath at Kingswear, Devon. The memorial board from St Peter's School, carved with the name of Jones can be seen in Seaford Museum. In addition the 'Colonel H' Public house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk is named in his honour.

Geologically, Muswellbrook is situated in the northern parts of the Sydney basin, bordering the New England region. The area is predominantly known for coal mining and horse breeding, but has also developed a reputation for gourmet food and wine production. As at June 2018 Muswellbrook has a population of 12,364. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. Located to the south of the Muswellbrook township are two coal fuelled power stations, Liddell and Bayswater. They were commissioned in 1973 and mid 1980s respectively and employ approximately 500 people from the area. History Before European settlement of the region the Wonnarua and Gamilaroi peoples occupied the land. The first European to explore the area was Chief Constable John Howe in 1819, with the first white settlement occurring in the 1820s. The township of Muswellbrook was gazetted on 23 October 1833. Exercise book Historical notes - hand-written, indexed in back To the south, \\"Forbestown\\" was established by the sons of Francis Forbes in 1842; the name was changed in 1848 to \\"South Muswellbrook\\" to prevent confusion with the town of Forbes.  Heritage listings  Muswellbrook has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 7 Bridge Street: Muswellbrook Post Office *132 Bridge Street: Weidmann Cottage * 142-144 Bridge Street: Loxton House * 178, 180-188 Bridge Street: Eatons Group * 710 Denman Road: Edinglassie * Denman Road: Rous Lench * Hunter Terrace: St Alban's Anglican Church * Main Northern railway: Muswellbrook railway station Etymology \\"Mussel Creek\\" (now called \\"Muscle Creek\\") was first named by a party of surveyors who found mussels in the small stream while camping along its banks in the early 19th century. The present spelling of Muswellbrook has a disputed etymology. Historians largely subscribe to one of two theories: # that the name derives from the Muswell Hill area of London (England), due to the influence of Sir Francis Forbes whose wife, Amelia, was born and schooled in that town; or # that the name is a gradual corruption of the original gazetted name \\"Musclebrook\\", eventually adopted as the official spelling due to common use. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 12,075 people in Muswellbrook. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 9.3% of the population. * 84.9% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were New Zealand 1.4%, England 1.2% and Philippines 0.9%. * 87.7% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Anglican 27.8%, Catholic 24.5% and No Religion 23.5%. Transport The New England Highway currently passes through the town. A route was selected for a bypass in 2006 but the Australian Government suspended the project in August 2008.

Those covering the period of the Third Reich have since become standard sources and have been extensively quoted by Saul Friedl√§nder,See: Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution, 1933‚Äì39 Harper Perennial, 1998 and Nazi Germany and the Jews: the Years of Destruction, 1939‚Äì45 Harper Perennial, 2008 Michael Burleigh,See: The Third Reich: A New History Hill and Wang, 2001 Richard J.

His parents were Dr. Wilhelm Klemperer, a rabbi, and Henriette n√©e Frankel. Victor had three brothers and four sisters: * Georg, 1865‚Äì1946, physician, director of the hospital Berlin-Moabit (who treated Vladimir Lenin) * Felix, 1866‚Äì1932, physician, director of the hospital Berlin-Reinickendorf * Margarete (Grete), 1867‚Äì1942, married Riesenfeld * Hedwig, 1870‚Äì1893, married Machol * Berthold, 1871‚Äì1931, lawyer * Marta, 1873‚Äì1954, married Jelski * Valeska (Wally), 1877‚Äì1936, married Sussmann Victor was a cousin to the conductor Otto Klemperer, and first cousin once removed to Otto's son, the actor Werner Klemperer. In 1903 Klemperer converted to Protestantism for the first time, shortly thereafter returning to Judaism. Victor Klemperer attended several gymnasia. He was a student of philosophy, Romance and German studies at universities in Munich, Geneva, Paris and Berlin from 1902 to 1905, and later worked as a journalist and writer in Berlin, until he resumed his studies in Munich from 1912. Though not a religious man, Victor Klemperer needed a religious identity, as Jew, Christian or dissident, to support his academic career. He chose Christianity as being most compatible with his much stronger conviction of being German, and became baptised again in Berlin in 1912.\\"Vielleicht schon bei meiner neuen Immatrikulation, sicher aber, wenn ich mich um die Dozentur bew√ºrbe, w√ºrde ich bestimmte Angaben machen und Papiere vorlegen m√ºssen. Es war n√∂tig, da√ü ich jetzt entweder Mitglied einer j√ºdischen Gemeinde wurde oder mir mein Christentum noch einmal bescheinigen lie√ü oder aber durch ausdr√ºckliches Schreiben die L√∂schung des damaligen Eintrags im Kirchenregister herbeif√ºhrte und mich zugleich als Dissidenten bekannte ‚Ä¶ allen traditionellen Glaubensformen stand ich mit unterschiedlos gleicher Indifferenz und K√§lte gegen√ºber ‚Ä¶ ich hatte ‚Ä¶ nicht mehr die feste √úberzeugung, da√ü sich Judentum und Deutschtum unter allen Umst√§nden miteinander vertragen k√∂nnten ‚Ä¶ Ich sagte ihm [the pastor, Pfarrer Egidi, whom he was asking for baptism], es sei mir genauso unm√∂glich, an das christliche Dogma zu glauben wie an den Jahve des Alten Testaments. Doch empf√§nde ich das Christentums als ein wesentliches Element der deutschen Kultur, in die ich hineingeboren, der ich durch meine Bildung, meine Ehe, mein gesamtes Denken un F√ºhlen unl√∂slich verbunden sei.\\" Victor Klemperer, Curriculum Vitae: Erinnerungen eines Philologen 1881‚Äì1918 (Berlin, 1989), vol. 2, pp. 15‚Äì16. He completed his doctorate (on Montesquieu) in 1913 and was habilitated under the supervision of Karl Vossler in 1914. From 1914 to 1915, Klemperer lectured at the University of Naples, after which he became a decorated military volunteer in World War I. From 1920 he was Professor of Romance Languages at the Technical University of Dresden.Omer Bartov. 2003. Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories. Cornell University Press. pp. 197‚Äì98 Third Reich Despite his conversion to Protestantism in 1912 and his strong identification with German culture, Klemperer's life started to worsen considerably after the Nazis' seizure of power in 1933. Under the 1933 Nazi \\"First Racial Definition\\", a person was defined as a \\"non-Aryan\\" (Jew) if they had one Jewish parent or grandparent, regardless of religious belief. The house at Maxim Gorki Street No 16 in Pirna, where he hid his diaries. Klemperer's diary, which he kept up throughout the Nazi era, provides an exceptional account of day-to-day life under the tyranny of the Third Reich. Two of the three volumes of his diaries that have been published in English translations, I Will Bear Witness and To the Bitter End, concern this period. This diary also details the Nazis' perversion of the German language for propaganda purposes in entries that Klemperer used as the basis for his postwar book LTI ‚Äì Lingua Tertii Imperii. Klemperer's diary chiefly chronicles the restricted daily life of Jews during the Nazi terror, including the onset of a succession of prohibitions concerning many aspects of everyday existence, such as finances, transportation, medical care, the maintenance and use of household help, food and diet, and the possession of appliances, newspapers, and other items. He also gives accounts of suicides, household searches, and the deportation of his friends, mostly to Theresienstadt. Throughout his experience, Klemperer maintained his sense of identity as a German, expressing even in 1942 that \\"I am German, and still waiting for the Germans to come back; they have gone to ground somewhere\\".Omer Bartov. 2003. Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories. Cornell University Press. p. 200 Although this is one of the phrases most evocative of Klemperer's despair over the corruption of German culture, his sense of who and what was truly \\"German\\" evolved considerably during the war. Especially in the final weeks of the war and immediately after Germany's surrender, when Klemperer was free to mix and talk with (or eavesdrop on) a wide variety of Germans, his observations of the \\"German\\" identity show how complex this question was, and why it was so central to his purpose in writing the LTI and his journals. A plaque on Klemperer's former residence in Berlin-Wilmersdorf In 1933 the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed removing all non- Aryan professors from their profession, with the exception of those who had fought in World War I. This exception allowed Klemperer to continue in his position a little longer, although without the right to use the University library or other faculty privileges. However Klemperer was gradually forced out of his job and forced to retire. Although he was allowed to keep part of his pension, the money quickly ran out and he and his wife had to take cleaning jobs. Victor Klemperer's wife was not Jewish. She was an \\"Aryan\\" German, and her marriage to Klemperer allowed him to survive this period, as many intermarried Jews were able to. The Nazi Government could not effectively force people to divorce, so many intermarried Jewish and non-Jewish Germans stayed married, despite scrutiny by others. Intermarriage helped Victor Klemperer to survive, but brought down his wife's societal status. The couple lost their right to drive and had to sell their car, and their housekeeper had to resign due to the law against Jews employing Aryan women. Eventually the Klemperers were forced to put down their household cat, a tomcat named Muschel, because of a restriction as to Jews' ownership of pets. A Nazi law obliged every Jewish female or male to add Sarah or Israel, respectively, as a middle name on all official documents, allowing Jews to be identified as such whenever required to give their full name. (Klemperer dropped the \\"Israel\\" as soon as he could safely do so.) His wife, not Jewish, did not have to do this. That same year, and subsequently, Klemperer was so dismayed with the spread of antisemitism, even among those who professed to be against the Nazis, that he from time to time entertained the possibility of fleeing to the US. A later diary entry‚Äîfor April 10, 1940‚Äîrecords other problems with emigration: \\"Meeting with the emigration adviser of the Jewish Community, result less than zero: You really must get out‚Äîwe see no possibility. American-Jewish committees support only observant Jews.\\" But in the end his connection to his fatherland was too strong, even after Kristallnacht in November 1938, and the outbreak of war. During the pogrom later in November 1938 their house was searched by Nazis who found Klemperer's saber from World War I‚Äîhe was arrested briefly and released.Omer Bartov. 2003. Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories. Cornell University Press. pp. 205‚Äì208 By this time he had come to concede that \\"No one can take my Germanness away from me, but my nationalism and patriotism are gone forever.\\"Omer Bartov. 2003. Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories. Cornell University Press. pp. 208 This release can be attached to the fact that he had a German wife. Although the day after his arrest he wrote to his brother Georg asking for assistance in leaving Germany, in the end he did not do so. Since his wife, Eva, was \\"Aryan\\", Klemperer avoided deportation, often narrowly, but in 1940, he and his wife were rehoused under miserable conditions in a \\"Jews' House\\" (Judenhaus) with other \\"mixed couples\\". Here, and especially when he ventured out, or at factories where he was forced to work, he was routinely questioned, mistreated, and humiliated by the Gestapo, Hitler Youth members and Dresden citizens. Only because of his \\"Aryan\\" German wife were the couple able to procure food enough to subsist. In the diary, the much-feared Gestapo is seen carrying out daily, humiliating, and brutal house searches, delivering beatings, hurling insults, and robbing inhabitants of coveted foodstuffs and other household items. In addition, the diary relates the profound uncertainty all Germans‚ÄîJews and non-Jews‚Äîexperienced because of the paucity of reliable information about the war's progress, largely due to the propaganda so central to the Reich's conduct of the war and of the Final Solution. Klemperer and his fellow Jews became aware only gradually of the nature of atrocities and scale of \\"extermination\\" at camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, even as they watched friends and neighbors deported and their risk of deportation mounted.Margaret MacMillan. 2015. History's People: Personalities and the Past. House of Anansi Press pp. 327‚Äì43 Flight On 13 February 1945 Klemperer witnessed the delivery of notices of deportation to some of the last remaining members of the Jewish community in Dresden, and feared that the authorities would soon also send him to his death. On the following three nights the Allies heavily bombed Dresden for the first time, causing massive damage and a firestorm; during the chaos that followed, Klemperer removed his yellow star (punishable by death if discovered) on 19 February, joined a refugee column, and escaped into American-controlled territory. He and his wife survived, and Klemperer's diary narrates their return, largely on foot through Bavaria and Eastern Germany, to their house in D√∂lzschen, on the outskirts of Dresden.Victor Klemperer. 1999. pp. 507, 574, 629 They managed to reclaim the house, which the Nazis had \\"aryanised\\". Post-war After the war, Klemperer joined the communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and recovered a university post at the University of Leipzig. His former friend, historian Johannes K√ºhn, who had severed connections with Klemperer upon his dismissal from the University of Dresden, welcomed him back as if nothing had happened.Omer Bartov. 2003. Germany's War and the Holocaust: Disputed Histories. Cornell University Press. p. 201 He became a significant cultural figure in East Germany, lecturing at the universities of Greifswald, Berlin and Halle. He was a delegate of the Cultural Association of the GDR in the GDR's Parliament (Volkskammer) from 1950 to 1958, and frequently mentions in his later diary his frustration at its lack of power and its largely ceremonial role. Klemperer's diary was published in 1995 as Tageb√ºcher (Berlin, Aufbau). It was an immediate literary sensation and rapidly became a bestseller in Germany. An English translation of the years spanning the Nazi seizure of power through Klemperer's death has appeared in three volumes: I Will Bear Witness (1933 to 1941), To The Bitter End (1942 to 1945) and The Lesser Evil (1945 to 1959). In 1995, Victor Klemperer was posthumously awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his work, Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten. Tageb√ºcher 1933‚Äì1945. Documentary In 2000, Herbert Gantschacher wrote, together with Katharina and J√ºrgen Rostock, the documentary play Chronicle 1933‚Äì1945 using original documents from the biographies of Robert Ley and Victor Klemperer. The first performance took place in 2000 in the documentation centre at the planned \\"Strength Through Joy\\" beach resort Prora on the island of R√ºgen in Germany.http://www.arbos.at/krieg_ist_dada_09/content/programm2.html In 2003, Stan Neumann directed a documentary based on Klemperer's diaries, La langue ne ment pas (Language does not lie), which considers the importance of Klemperer's observations and the role of the witness in extreme situations.

Putauaki (; also known in English as Mount Edgecumbe) is a dacite volcanic cone in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand. Located 50 km east of Rotorua and three kilometres east of Kawerau, it is the easternmost vent of the Okataina volcanic centre, within the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The mountain rises to 820 m above sea level, and is visible from the waters of the Bay of Plenty, 30 km to the north. Every year a King of the Mountain race is run on Putauaki as part of the international King of the Mountain series, and proceeds are donated to charity. History The last substantial volcanic eruption occurred around 300 BCE, producing a cubic kilometre of lava. Captain James Cook named the mountain \\"Mount Edgecumbe\\" on 2 November 1769, possibly in honour of John Edgecombe, the sergeant of marines on his vessel, the Endeavour. Compare the nearby town of Edgecumbe. The mountain's official name changed back to Putauaki in 1925. The New Zealand government took part of the mountain from the NgƒÅti Awa people in the 1880s as part of a series of North Island land confiscations, supposedly for the purposes of military settlement. In a 1999 report the Waitangi Tribunal declared the confiscation illegal because there was no prospect of placing settlers on the mountain. Legendary source of name  MƒÅori legend tells of a love affair that P≈´tauaki had with Whakaari/White Island. Another version of the legend is that P≈´tauaki was lonely after losing a fight for Pƒ´hanga (another mountain) so when he met Tarawera he decided to start a relationship with her. After raising a son and years of a troubled marriage, P≈´tauaki cast his eye out towards the sea, where the very beautiful Whakaari was. The two would call out to each other at night while Tarawera slept. One night P≈´tauaki could not contain his love any longer and decided to travel out to be with Whakaari. It is said that a mountain can only move once in their life and only at night so P≈´tauaki had to travel across the land fast. Little did he know, his son had awoken and was following him. He heard the little whimper from his son and turned around. He tried to tell his son to stay with Tarawera but the little mountain would not leave his father. Then the sun rose and froze the two mountains where they were. When Tarawera awoke she saw that her husband had left and she started to weep, thus creating the Tarawera Falls and river. Until this day Tarawera still cries and Whakaari still calls out for her lover, who is frozen to the spot near Kawerau.

The village centre is on the northern edge of the Romney Marsh, 12 miles (19 km) south-west of Ashford town. The northerly part of this village is Appledore Heath. History The name Appledore comes from the Old English apuldre (meaning apple tree) and is first recorded in the 10th century. Although a Brythonic origin is more likely (given the widespread survival of Brythonic names in Kent) e.g. from or connected with \\"dwr/dor\\" meaning water. Appledore was once a port on the estuary of the River Rother. Famously, the greater part of the Danish army (280 ships - 5000 men) wintered at Appledore in 892-93, before moving into Wessex and suffering defeat at the hands of the Saxons led by King Alfred's son Edward the Elder at Farnham in Surrey. The defeated Danes fell back to Benfleet in Essex where they were again defeated in battle. The importance of Appledore as a port diminished suddenly in the 13th-century when great storms caused the river Rother to change its course; the village street now leads down to the Royal Military Canal. A French raid in 1380 resulted in the burning of the church: it was later rebuilt. The village was permitted to hold a market in the main street by Edward II. In 1804, when there was threat of invasion by Napoleon the Royal Military Canal was built: Appledore stands on its northern bank.Historical notes The Rhee Wall, a 13th-century waterway, was built to carry silt away from the eastern part of the Romney Marsh; it runs from Appledore to New Romney. In film, the media and literature Appledore in Kent is known to generations of children as the setting for A. A. Milne's famous verse poem, \\"The Knight Whose Armour Didn't Squeak\\". Milne lived west in Hartfield. Appledore features in the series Darling Buds of May.

He argues that human emotions find their cause in evolution and offers ways by which we can use this for our advantage. More specifically, mammals are equipped with a nerve system that enables them to distinguish not only between pleasant and unpleasant sensations, but positive and negative experiences in general. While the biological term fitness refers to the capacity to create offspring, happiness (or quality of life) is, at least in a biological perspective, a question of the qualities of the experiences our nervous system offers us. In order to improve these experiences there are two main principles to consider: #To utilize the rewarding sensations the brain has evolved to offer in a way that gives optimal long-term benefits; and, similarly, to avoid punishing sensations. #To avoid stress and maladaptive ways of living in order to have a healthy mind with optimal potential for positive experiences. As to the first principle, humans may actually have been equipped with more powerful positive and negative sensations, compared to other mammals, due to our capacity for free will. That is, evolution might tend to add stronger incentives for behavior benefiting the genes in an individual with a powerful free will; as otherwise, the free will could easily result in maladaptive behavior. As to the second principle, it may be added that, as a rule of thumb, we ought to adapt our way of living to how we are designed by evolution to live. Current ideas in evolutionary medicine and evolutionary psychology suggest that mismatches between the environment of evolutionary adaptation and the present way of living may cause somatic and mental health problems. Such adverse mismatches, referred to as discords, are obviously detrimental to quality of life. For example, unlike Europeans, Indigenous Australians have not had many generations exposed to alcohol, and so are prone to alcohol abuse and the social deprivation it causes. Grinde argues that \\"Chemical stimulants do not appear to be a good long-term strategy for contentment.\\"p104, Darwinian Happiness.

It was built to transport coal from pits in Durham to boats on the River Tyne. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.Tyne & Wear Sites and Monuments Record schedule retrieved 25 October 2013 The railway is open every week on Thursday, Friday and Saturday (Easter til October) as well as on a number of event days throughout the year. History =Background= The Grand Allies, a partnership of businessmen including John Bowes, opened a colliery at Springwell in Durham. A railway was needed to transport the coal to the River Tyne. The plan was to build inclined planes and use a combination of steam power and gravity to move the coal wagons. The railway was designed by George Stephenson, who built the Hetton colliery railway completed in 1822. =Construction= The railway was built between Mount Moor and Jarrow via Springwell village. The first section, between Springwell and Jarrow, opened on 17 January 1826. Mount Moor followed in April 1826.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p11 When the line opened it comprised four inclined planes: one steep incline from Mount Moor to Blackham's Hill, and one from Blackham's Hill to Springwell. At Blackham's Hill, the summit of both inclines, was the \\"hauler house\\", housing stationary engines to wind the ropes. A long self- acting incline ran from Springwell. Nearly of locomotive-worked line extended to Jarrow where a final incline served the coal staiths.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p11 The line was extended across the Team Valley to Kibblesworth Colliery in May 1842.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p12 The railway was completed in 1854 when a link from Marley Hill to Kibblesworth was connected enabling collieries in Dipton to be accessed.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p24 =Operation= From 1 January 1947, the railway was owned and operated by the National Coal Board.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p34 After 1974 no inclines remained working and the line was only worked north east of Wardley. The last day the inclines were used, Friday 4 October 1974, was filmed by BBC and Tyne-Tees TV crews.The Bowes Railway by Colin Mountford p42 What was left of the Bowes Railway north east of the inclines was served by a shed at Wardley. The line was reduced in length, until at the end there was only about in use. This last section closed on 10 January 1986, a few days short of the 180th anniversary.

The preserved Bowes railway, includes Springwell Colliery workshops, a one mile passenger railway and a further mile of rope hauled inclines. Visitors can visit the Victorian workshops and see engineering and blacksmithing demonstrations. A tour of the railway buildings, see the railways Waggon fleet as well as visit the small museum, cafe and shop can all be done at Springwell. In the future the railway wish to restart passenger rides and rope haulage demonstrations for the benefit of the public. =Rope Haulage= Original System When the Bowes Railway was in full operation the line employed eight rope-worked inclined planes. Two of these (the Springwell and Birkheads inclines) were operated on the self-acting principle; the weight of descending full waggons hauled up the empty waggons via a rope running around a return wheel at the top of the hill. On the remaining six inclines (the Kibblesworth, Black Fell, Blackhams Hill East and West, Starrs and Allerdene Inclines), the ropes were driven by a stationary steam or later electric haulage engine located at the incline top. This type of railway operation pre- dates modern locomotive-type operations, and was laid down here by George Stephenson in 1826. The line's gradual closure eventually left only four inclines in use, these finally closing on 4 October 1974. Preserved System The line, as preserved post-1974, includes two rope-worked inclines. These are the Blackhams Hill East and West inclines. Both are worked by the Blackhams Hill engine, a 300 h.p. Metropolitan Vickers engine commissioned on 30 July 1950. This engine works both the East or Flatt Incline (1170 yards at a gradient of 1 in 70) and the West or Short Bank (750 yards at a gradient 1 in 13). Over these inclines, the preserved railway demonstrates one of the oldest and most unusual types of railway operation. It is now the only place in Britain where this can be seen. The inclines are not currently operational, however, due to vandalism and decline. The Bowes Railway, C Mountford, 1980 =Locomotives and brake vans= Steam locomotives *Andrew Barclay W.S.T.

Chhipaa or Ranjit) is one of the castes of Newar. The Newari caste system is divided according to profession. The Ranjitkar caste is concerned with the dyeing of clothes as well as other color related activities. The word \\"Ranjitkar\\" comes from Sanskrit origins crudely meaning \\"people concerned with colors\\" whereas the word \\"Chhipaa\\" is a Nepal Bhasa compound word which can be roughly translated as \\"color and allow to dry\\".  History  There are very little written historic documents on Ranjitkars. However, judging by the extravagant clothings that are seen in the sculptures, one can speculate that Ranjitkars or some other people were present in the Nepal during the Licchavi era by latest. The first mention of Ranjitkars in written history might have been during the declaration of the division of castes by Jayasthiti Malla.  Race Ethnically, Ranjitkars like other Newar communities are of diverse origin including but not limited to various Indic and Tibeto-Burman tribes. They have features resembling both Tibeto Burman and Aryans. So, one may infer that Ranjitkars are heterogeneous groups rather that a kin or ethnically homogeneous group.  Religion  Like all NewƒÅs, Ranjitkars follow a syncretic Hindu-Buddhist religion. The priest of Ranjitkars are Bajrachharyas who are Buddhists. However, most of the rituals performed are Hindu. Recently, an emergence of Theravada Buddhism has been observed in the Ranjitkars especially amongst those in Kathmandu.  Language Nepal Bhasa is the native tongue of the Ranjitkars. Nowadays many youngsters use the Nepali language as well.  Location There are three main localities of Ranjitkars in Kathmandu valley. They are in MajipƒÅ (‡§Æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§™‡§æ) of Yen (Downtown Kathmandu), a locality in Yala (Patan) and Golmadi in Bhaktapur. Besides these, Ranjitkars have settlements in Kirtipur, Hetaunda, Bhimphedi, Madhyapur, Banepa, Trishuli, Balaju and other cities of Nepal. With modernization and migration, many Ranjitkars have migrated and settled in different parts of the globe.  Festivals  Ranjitkars celebrate almost all of the festivals of Newars. The major festivals which celebrated by the community are as follows: = Majipa Lakhey Dance = Majipa Lakhey (Lakhey Aaju, Devnagari: ‡§Æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§™‡§æ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ‡•á, ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ‡•á ‡§Ü‡§ú‡•Å) is a special Lakhey. He is also known as the peaceful Bhairav. The dance of this lakhey takes place only in the week of full moon of Yenlaa month of Nepal Sambat during Kumari Jatra which is the biggest religious street festival in Kathmandu, Nepal. This lakhey is considered to be the protector of the children. The dance is especially conducted by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu. The dress and mask of the Majipa Lakhey are kept in Majipa Lakhey Chhen (Home). = Baalaa Charhe = Also known as Baalaa Chaturdashi, it is celebrated according to lunar calendar. The festival is primarily centered in Yen(Kathmandu). It is a festival revering the deitified female ancestor called Ajima (from Newari Aji=grandmother, Ma=Mother). A guthi of Baakunani actively participates in the jatra held on the day. = Yenya Punhi = Yenya Punhi is celebrated on the full moon day of Yenla month of the Nepali calendar. Also known as Indra Jatra, it is one of the greatest festival of Yen. Majipa Lakhe dance is one of the main attractions of the jatra. Majipa Lakhey is considered as the calm Bhairab who protects children from evils and demons. A guthi in Lakhenani organises the dance which takes place for a week. Majipa Lakhey Deity is one of the most popular symbol of Nepalese culture and religion. = Buddha Jayanti = The day marks the birth, enlightenment and nirvana of Gautama Buddha.  Lifestyle With the Independence of India, incorporation of Tibet into China and fall of Rana regime in Nepal, the traditional lifestyle breathed its last and made way for new Nepal. The traditional designated dye related work became non-viable due to open market of Nepal which allowed open inflow of refined fabrics and dyed products. So, most of the Ranjitkars have given up the traditional profession. However, some have \\"evolved\\" their profession by working as experts for the Royals of Nepal. These people blend the valuable metals into the clothes as well as maintain and repair Shreepech (crown of Nepal). In the last six decades, Ranjitkars have evolved as one of the literate castes of Nepal. Ranjitkars have thus been contributing in almost every walk of Nepalese society as educated professionals.

Originally called Bray Castle, it occupies a commanding position guarding the gap in the South Downs cut by the River Ouse and occupied by the towns of Lewes and Cliffe. It stands on a man-made mount just to the north of the high street in Lewes, and is constructed from local limestone and flint blocks. History The Barbican The castle follows a motte and bailey design but, unusually, it has two mottes. The only other castle in England to have two mottes is Lincoln Castle. The first motte, known as Brack Mount, was completed shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the second motte, known as the Keep, was completed in the late 11th century. Both mottes were built by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. The mottes would originally have been surmounted by wooden palisades but these were replaced with masonry shell keeps at the start of the 12th century. The bailey area also had a stone wall with towers. Soldiers went out from the castle to engage with Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Lewes in 1264. Towers were added to one of the shell keeps in the 13th century and a barbican gate was added in the 14th century. When the last of the de Warennes, John, the 7th Earl, died without issue in 1347, he was buried in Lewes Priory. His title passed to his nephew Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The castle was leased by Sussex Archaeological Society from 1850 and was acquired by Charles Thomas-Stanford and gifted to the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1922. =Wall collapse= On 11 November 2019 at 12:22 GMT the first alert was raised that a 10m by 10m section of the curtain wall had collapsed onto an adjacent house and garden. Emergency services searched the site but found no casualties. Sussex Archaeological Society said that the wall that collapsed was privately owned and one of the last parts of the curtain wall. They also said that the parts owned by the society were checked independently on an annual basis. The castle was closed as a precaution. The wall was described in a contemporaneous news report as weighing 600 tonnes.

Written by Meyer Dolinsky and directed by David Alexander, it was first broadcast November 22, 1968. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise encounter an ageless and sadistic race of humanoids with the power of telekinesis. The episode is notable for depicting a passionate inter-racial kiss between a white man (Kirk) and a black woman (Uhura), which was daring for 1960s US television. It was one of several episodes not screened by the BBC because of their \\"unpleasant\\" content, including torture and sadism. Plot Captain Kirk, along with First Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, beams down to a planet to investigate a distress call. Once there, they are greeted by a friendly dwarf named Alexander (Michael Dunn). He leads the landing party to meet the rest of his people, who have adopted classical Greek culture, and named themselves Platonians in honor of the Greek philosopher Plato. All of the Platonians, except for Alexander, possess telekinetic powers, and the planet's ruling class have become exceedingly arrogant as a result, believing they can do as they please because of their powers. The Platonians explain they \\"lured\\" the Enterprise to their planet because their leader, Parmen, requires medical help. After being treated by Dr. McCoy, Parmen demands McCoy remain on the planet to treat other Platonians. When Captain Kirk objects, the Platonians use their powers to punish him. Alexander wishes to tell Kirk and Spock that Parmen wishes to kill them but is afraid. Parmen repeatedly humiliates Kirk and Spock as Dr. McCoy watches, trying to make him agree to stay on the planet. Later, the Platonians use their powers to force two other Enterprise officers to the planet for their entertainment: Communications Officer Lt. Uhura and Nurse Chapel. McCoy takes a sample of Alexander's blood and manages to isolate and identify the kironide mineral that provides the inhabitants with their special powers; it is abundant in the natural food and water supply of the planet. McCoy is able to prepare a serum and inject Kirk and Spock with doses to make them have twice the power of Parmen. Alexander asks where does Kirk come from and if size matters. Kirk says size, color, and species does not matter. Alexander asks to go with Kirk. While waiting for it to take effect, Parmen forces the four to perform again. Alexander becomes angry after watching the humiliating tricks played upon the crew by his fellow Platonians and he tries, unsuccessfully, to attack Parmen with a knife. Kirk uses his new-found telekinetic powers to defeat Parmen and save Alexander's life. Parmen then promises to mend his bullying ways, but Kirk doesn't believe him, and warns Parmen, should he go back on his word, the powers can be recreated by anyone whenever they wish to defeat him. Kirk promises to send appropriate medical technicians to the planet as long as the Platonians behave themselves, and Alexander requests to go with the Enterprise to start a new life elsewhere in the Galaxy. With Alexander by his side, Kirk contacts the Enterprise and tells Scotty. \\"I am bringing a little surprise onboard.\\" The kiss The kiss between Kirk and Uhura is sometimes cited as the first white and black interracial kiss portrayed on US television. The episode features a passionate kiss between James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) which is usually described as the first scripted interracial kiss of that kind between a white man and a black woman on American television.. Several takes of the scene were filmed, with different levels of contact between the actors, and many speculate on which version was used in the final cut of the episode. William Shatner recalls in Star Trek Memories that NBC insisted their lips never touch (the technique of turning their heads away from the camera was used to conceal this). However, Nichelle Nichols insists in her autobiography Beyond Uhura (written in 1994 after Shatner's book) that the kiss was real, even in takes where her head obscures their lips.Nichelle Nichols, Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories, G.P. Putnam & Sons New York, 1994. pp.195-198 There are many who claim that, even if the kiss was real, it was not the first interracial kiss on television, however, many of these incidents were not portrayed as the passionate kiss between Kirk and Uhura was. A good example of this is the friendly cheek-to- cheek kiss between Sammy Davis, Jr. and Nancy Sinatra on Movin' with Nancy in 1967, a year before \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" aired.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdBpxEf4U0 Other instances are: Adventures in Paradise (1960) - \\"The Big Surf\\", between Gardner McKay and Pilar Seurat, and Laramie (1961) - \\"Dragan at the Door\\" (Season 3, Episode 1), by Nobu McCarthy and Robert Fuller. When NBC executives learned of the kiss they became concerned it would anger TV stations in the Deep South.Nichols, p.195 There were, however, few contemporary records of any complaints commenting on the scene.Nichols, pp.196-197 Nichelle Nichols observes that \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" which first aired in November 1968 \\"received a huge response. We received one of the largest batches of fan mail ever, all of it very positive, with many addressed to me from girls wondering how it felt to kiss Captain Kirk, and many to him from guys wondering the same thing about me. However, almost no one found the kiss offensive\\" except from a single, mildly negative letter from one white Southerner who wrote: \\"I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it.\\" Nichols notes that \\"for me, the most memorable episode of our last season was 'Plato's Stepchildren.'\\"Nichols, p.193 Reception It was one of several episodes not screened by the BBC because of their \\"unpleasant\\" content, including torture and sadism. (The other episodes that were censored in this way were \\"The Empath\\", \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" and \\"Miri\\".) The U.K. reviewed Star Trek in part as a children's show and restricted episodes that included several with overt depictions of torture and sexuality they felt were not appropriate for children. For example, Marta's dance in \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" was deemed too sexual for it be recommended for children's viewing material. The episode is notable for depicting an inter- racial kiss between a white man (Kirk) and a black woman (Uhura), which was daring for 1960s US television. This was one of the first interracial kisses on television. In 2016, TVline ranked the interracial kiss as one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek. In 2009, Newsweek pointed out the moral lessons of this episode, in particular Kirk's lines to the oppressed alien. The alien is being mistreated on the planet, and is surprised when Kirk informs him about Starfleet standards. In 2016, TVline ranked this as having another one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek, noting the scene where Spock and Kirk are forced to dance by the powerful but cruel aliens. On the fiftieth anniversary of the first broadcast of Star Trek, National Geographic noted the Kirk-Uhura kiss as \\"iconic\\", which they describe as connecting to the period's civil rights issues. In 2016, Radio Times ranked the kiss between Uhura and Kirk as the 25th best moment in all Star Trek. In 2016, SyFy noted this episode for actress Nichelle Nichols presentation of Uhura, as having her best scene in Star Trek. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" the fourth worst episode of the original Star Trek television series.

It is particularly famous for the cultivation of kiwifruit. Te Puke has a population of 7,496 as of the 2013 Census. Te Puke is close to Tauranga, Mount Maunganui, Papamoa, and Maketu, which are all coastal towns/cities, as well as the small townships of Waitangi, Manoeka, Pongakawa, and Paengaroa. The Tauranga Eastern Link, completed in 2015, moved State Highway 2 away from Te Puke and removed large volumes of traffic from its streets. The town's name means The Hill, and should be pronounced \\"teh-pook- ee\\", not the occasional \\"Te-Pyook\\". This name is reflective of its location, as it is on a hill near the Papamoa Hills.  History and culture  = Settlement = Around 1350, the Te Arawa canoe is said to have landed at Maketu after sailing from Hawaiki. The canoe was under the command of chief Tama-te-kapua, and he was responsible for many of the original place names of the area. MƒÅori ventured up the rivers and streams and built many pƒÅ in the area. Lieutenant, later Captain James Cook, the first European known to visit the area, sailed between Motiti Island and the coast in 1769. This was his first voyage to New Zealand, but he did not land here. Cook named the area the Bay of Plenty as he observed that it was well populated and looked very fertile. In 1830 Danish sailor Philip Tapsell, also known as Hans Homman Felk, settled at Maketu and operated as a trader. Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries arrived shortly afterwards and established mission stations at Te Papa (Tauranga) and at Rotorua. After the land wars began to ease in the 1860s, European settlers began to move to the Bay of Plenty though not in great numbers. Maketu, however was a thriving village with a school, post office, and hotel and in 1869 an Anglican church. In 1876, surveying of the Te Puke Block commenced but it was not until 1879 that they survey was completed as the Native Land Court needed to complete their investigation of MƒÅori titles for the land. Demand for land in the Tauranga area increased and the Tauranga Working Men's Land Association was formed in 1877. Forty eight members petitioned the government for 4000 acres (16 ha) of the Te Puke block under the deferred-payment system. At the same time George Vesey Stewart applied to the government to bring settlers from Great Britain to the Te Puke Block as he had already successfully done in Katikati. The first settlers on the Te Puke Block arrived in 1879 and included Peter Grant and his wife Caroline (n√©e Moon), William Bird and his wife Sarah (n√©e Leitch), Joseph Malyon and his wife Sara (n√©e James) amongst others. The first of the Vesey Stewart settlers arrived in Tauranga directly from London on the Lady Jocelyn on 2 January 1881. Development In July 1880, work commenced on the Tauranga to Te Puke Road, via Welcome Bay. It was constructed by the Armed Constabulary and local MƒÅori who worked on their land. Before this, access to Te Puke was made across the Papamoa Hills from Ngapeke to Manoeka, following an ancient MƒÅori trail. Peter Grant had been contracted by the Tauranga County Council to form this track into a bridle path in 1879. Stores and passengers for the town could also come from Tauranga by boat, first to Maketu, then up the Kaituna River to Canaan Landing and then by MƒÅori canoe up the Waiari Stream to the site of the present road bridge just to the south of the town. By late 1881, Te Puke boasted 25 wooden buildings including two hotels, two general stores, a butcher, a post office and a smithy. The settlers quickly settled upon the land and by 1884 had established a butter factory. Draining of the swamps began and the area was found to be very suitable for crops, and maize and wheat were grown extensively. Later much of the farming land was found to be \\"bush sick\\" but was cured with the use of cobalt in the 1930s. Flax milling had begun in the 1870s and became a major industry in the area until the early 1940s. Saw milling began in 1905 and is still a major industry in the area. In 1883 gold-bearing ore was discovered on the Papamoa Hills and during the 1920s a gold mine operated at Muir's farm on No 4 Road. With the building of the railway a large Public Works quarry operated in Te Puke and was a major employer. The freezing works at Rangiuru opened in 1968 and HortResearch opened on No 1 Road in 1971. Disaster struck in the early hours of the 10 June 1886 with the eruption of Mount Tarawera. Te Puke residents were awoken with the noise and the many related earthquakes. Many had a good view of the eruption and paintings survive of their memories. Ash and mud showered over crops and pastures up to 12 inches deep in places. The sun was not seen until 1pm. Stock faced starvation and many farmers were forced to let their animals free to fend for themselves. Some stock was shipped from the area but many died. The settlers became short of food and water themselves and help was gratefully received from Tauranga. Evidence of the Tarawera eruption can still be found in disturbed ground in the area today. (Te Puke was again covered in ash during the 1995 Mount Ruapehu eruption though not to the same scale.) View of Main Street in 1924 including Alexander & Dowdy real estate agents, building and Farmers' Union Trading Company Te Puke town-ship began to grow and a mission/town hall was built in 1883. This was used for town meetings and as a church by three of the congregations. The first school, (Te Puke Primary) was opened in 1883. The Te Puke Times was first printed in 1912. The fire brigade and town boards were both formed in 1913. A jockey club was formed in 1890, the brass band in 1903, the A. & P. Society in 1905, the rugby union in 1906, the bowling club in 1908, and the golf club in 1912. Planting of the trees down the centre of the main street, a major feature of the town today, began during 1914-1918 as a war memorial to the fallen. A nursing home was opened in Boucher Avenue in 1918 but any major cases were railed to Tauranga Hospital. = Railway = The East Coast Main Trunk Railway passes through Te Puke and opened in 1928. Rail passenger services were provided by the Taneatua Express which operated between Auckland and Taneatua between 1928 and 1959. In February 1959, the steam hauled express train service was replaced by a railcar service operated by 88 seaters that only ran as far as Te Puke. The railcar service operated between 1959 and 1967, when it was cancelled due to both mechanical problems with the railcars and poor patronage, the latter largely due to the circuitous and time-consuming rail route between Auckland and the Bay of Plenty at that time. = Horticulture = A combination of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and it was found that pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6 km¬≤) of land of which was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (tree tomatoes) and feijoas. In 1934 Jim MacLoughlin had bought a lemon and passionfruit orchard in No 3 Road. His neighbour Vic Bayliss had two Chinese gooseberry plants and he had sold the fruit for ¬£5! Spurred on by this Jim planted ¬Ω acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name ‚ÄúKiwifruit‚Äù was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular. In 1998 ‚ÄúZespri Gold‚Äù kiwifruit was introduced to the market and experiments are being carried out on new varieties including a peelable kiwifruit and \\"kiwiberry\\", a small bite-sized kiwifruit-like fruit. =Marae= There are five marae in Te Puke, affiliated with local iwi and hap≈´: Haraki Marae and meeting house are affiliated with Waitaha and the NgƒÅti Rangiwewehi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Rangiwewehi ki Tai. Makahae - Te Kahika Marae is affiliated with the Tapuika hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Tuheke. In October 2020, the Government committed $4,525,104 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and nine others, creating an estimated 34 jobs. Manoeka Marae and Hei meeting house are affiliated with Waitaha. Moko - NgƒÅti Moko Marae and the Mokotangatakotahi meeting house are affiliated with the Tapuika hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Moko. Tawakepito Marae and Tawakepito meeting house is affiliated with the Tapuika hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Tuheke. Economy Agriculture is the backbone of the district's economy. The warm, moist climate and fertile soils are favourable for horticulture, with production of kiwifruit, avocados and citrus fruit such as lemons and oranges. The town markets itself as the \\"Kiwifruit capital of the world\\". Dairy cattle and other livestock are also farmed. Today, Te Puke is a thriving town with a reasonably large main shopping street, Jellicoe Street, which is also the main road passing through Te Puke. There are a number of schools, religious organisations, cultural groups, and a variety of clubs in the town. A large number of residents work picking or packing kiwifruit during April or May, as well as others coming from other nearby towns and cities. It can swell past 10,000 some seasons.

It runs along the foot of the Chilterns escarpment. Although a few fields away it has since been given the nickname 'The Icknield Line' for its connection to the Lower Icknield Way.  History  The line was part of the former Great Western Railway branch line between Watlington and Princes Risborough. British Railways closed the line to passenger traffic in 1957. The section between Chinnor and Princes Risborough thereafter carried a freight-only cement service until 1989.  Preservation  =Reopening= The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway Association was formed around August 1989. On 19 May 1991, the first train - a works train headed by a 0-4-0 Baguley diesel - ran from Chinnor. It began to operate passenger trains between Chinnor and the site of the former Wainhill Halt (about 1 km NE of Chinnor) in August 1994. In 1995, the route was extended by about 3 km to Horsenden Lane, and then to the old rail connection that led trains to Oxford now known as Thame Junction in 1996. On 21 February 2016, the railway was connected to the main line at Princes Risborough, with services commencing later that year running in to a siding adjacent to Platform 4 at Princes Risborough while works were being undertaken to rebuild the platform there. Some service trains were not always able to run that far either due to Network Rail / Chiltern Railways requirements or other works related to platform reinstatement and continued to terminate at Thame Junction. The railway now operates between Chinnor and platform 4 at Princes Risborough, although some services may continue to terminate and turn around at Thame Junction for operational reasons. There is no platform at Thame Junction. Work to reinstate platform 4 at Princes Risborough was completed in August 2018. =Princes Risborough extension= Following discussions with Network Rail, an extension of about a mile (1.5 km) to Princes Risborough main line railway station was undertaken, with a view to running into Princes Risborough station. This would allow passengers to connect from Chiltern Railways services on the Chiltern Main Line. Previously, the line was reconnected at a point just yards from the headshunt at Thame Junction for special events to allow trains to run into Princes Risborough station: in October 2013, the line was reconnected for the first 3 weekends for the Railway's \\"Haversham & Friends\\" celebrations, and the first through-train for 57 years, a rail tour from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough, ran on 5 October 2013. On 21 February 2016, a small team of volunteers used a road-rail vehicle to install a track panel in place of a Network Rail buffer stop to reinstate the physical connection to Princes Risborough; the following day, official boundary gates and safety signage were installed, making the line operational.Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway.

The genus has a disjunct distribution around the globe, with species occurring on most continents in temperate and subtropical regions. South America has the most species, followed by North America and southern Africa. There are several scattered across Europe and Asia, and one is native to Australia.Fukuda, T., et al. (2001).

The most common are Lycium barbarum and Lycium chinense, whose fruits (wolfberries or goji berries) are a traditional food crop in China. Etymology The generic name Lycium is derived from the Greek word ŒªœÖŒ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ (lykion), which was applied by Pliny the Elder (23-79) and Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40-90) to a plant known as dyer's buckthorn. It was probably a Rhamnus species and was named for Lycia (ŒõœÖŒ∫ŒØŒ±), the ancient southern Anatolian region in which it grew.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . The berry is called lycii fructus (\\"lycium fruit\\") in old Latin pharmacological texts. Description Lycium barbarum Lycium are shrubs, often thorny, growing 1 to 4 meters tall. The leaves are small, narrow, and fleshy, and are alternately arranged, sometimes in fascicles. Flowers are solitary or borne in clusters. The funnel-shaped or bell-shaped corolla is white, green, or purple in color. The fruit is a two-chambered, usually fleshy and juicy berry which can be red, orange, yellow, or black. It may have few seeds or many. Most Lycium have fleshy, red berries with over 10 seeds, but a few American taxa have hard fruits with two seeds. While most Lycium are monoecious, producing bisexual flowers with functional male and female parts, some species are gynodioecious, with some individuals bearing bisexual flowers and some producing functionally female flowers.Miller, J. S. and D. L. Venable. (2002). The transition to gender dimorphism on an evolutionary background of self-incompatibility: an example from Lycium (Solanaceae). American Journal of Botany 89(12), 1907-15. Uses Lycium has been known to European herbalists since ancient times, and species were traded from the Far East to Europe by the Romans, for example via Ariaca and the port of Barbarikon near today's Karachi, as mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. In his Naturalis historia, Pliny the Elder describes boxthorn as a medicinal plant, as does Pedanius Dioscorides in his P. Dioscoridae pharmacorum simplicium reique medicae. In his 1753 publication Species Plantarum, Linnaeus describes three Lycium species: L. afrum, L. barbarum, and L. europaeum.Hitchcock, C. L. (1932). A monographic study of the genus Lycium of the Western Hemisphere. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 19(2/3), 179-348 and 350-66. doi:10.2307/2394155 (First page image). L. barbarum Lycium, particularly L. barbarum, have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The leaves and roots of other species of Lycium, such as L. europaeum, when mixed with water, have been used in folk medicine.Nissim Krispil, Medicinal Plants in Israel and Throughout the World - the Complete Guide, Or Yehuda (Israel) 2000, pp.38‚Äì39 (Hebrew) The fruit of L. barbatum and L. chinense, known as goji berry, is commonly consumed as a dried fruit. The Chinese tonic gou qi zi (\\"wolfberry fruit\\") is made of the fruit of any of several Lycium species, and is used as a dietary supplement, although there is no evidence that it has any biological effects. Ecology Lycium species mostly occur in arid and semi-arid climates, and a few are known from coastal zones in somewhat saline habitat types. Invasive species include L. ferocissimum, which was introduced to Australia and New Zealand and has become a dense, thorny pest plant there.

Saraju Mohanty, Nanoelectronic Mixed-Signal System Design, McGraw-Hill, 2015, and 0071825711. \\"Mixed-Signal IC Design\\". quote: \\"mixed-signal (IC's with mixed analog and digital circuits on a single chip)\\" Mark Burns and Gordon W. Roberts, \\"An Introduction to Mixed-Signal IC Test and Measurement\\", 2001. \\"ESS Mixed Signal Circuits\\" In real-life applications mixed-signal designs are everywhere, for example, smart mobile phones. Mixed-signal ICs also process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to- digital converter is a mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal circuits or systems are typically cost-effective solutions for building any modern consumer electronics applications. Introduction An analog-mixed-signal system-on-a- chip (AMS-SoC) can be a combination of analog circuits, digital circuits, intrinsic mixed-signal circuits (like ADC), and embedded software. Integrated circuits (ICs) are generally classified as digital (e.g. a microprocessor) or analog (e.g. an operational amplifier). Mixed-signal ICs are chips that contain both digital and analog circuits on the same chip. This category of chip has grown dramatically with the increased use of 3G cell phones and other portable technologies. Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal (such as an FM radio transmission, a light wave or a sound) can be digitized using a very basic analog-to-digital converter, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these would be in the form of mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC would have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics that make this a non-trivial goal in chip design.  Examples  Typically, mixed-signal chips perform some whole function or sub-function in a larger assembly such as the radio subsystem of a cell phone, or the read data path and laser sled control logic of a DVD player. They often contain an entire system-on-a-chip. Examples of mixed-signal integrated circuits include data converters using delta-sigma modulation, analog-to- digital converter/digital-to-analog converter using error detection and correction, and digital radio chips. Digitally controlled sound chips are also mixed-signal circuits. With the advent of cellular technology and network technology this category now includes cellular telephone, software radio, LAN and WAN router integrated circuits. Because of the use of both digital signal processing and analog circuitry, mixed-signal ICs are usually designed for a very specific purpose and their design requires a high level of expertise and careful use of computer aided design (CAD) tools. Automated testing of the finished chips can also be challenging. Teradyne, Keysight, and Texas Instruments are the major suppliers of the test equipment for mixed-signal chips. The particular challenges of mixed signal include: * CMOS technology is usually optimal for digital performance and scaling while bipolar transistors are usually optimal for analog performance, yet until the last decade it has been difficult to either combine these cost-effectively or to design both analog and digital in a single technology without serious performance compromises. The advent of technologies like high performance CMOS, BiCMOS, CMOS SOI and SiGe have removed many of the compromises that previously had to be made. * Testing functional operation of mixed-signal ICs remains complex, expensive and often a \\"one-off\\" implementation task. * Systematic design methodologies comparable to digital design methods are far more primitive in the analog and mixed-signal arena. Analog circuit design can not generally be automated to nearly the extent that digital circuit design can. Combining the two technologies multiplies this complication. * Fast-changing digital signals send noise to sensitive analog inputs. One path for this noise is substrate coupling. A variety of techniques are used to attempt to block or cancel this noise coupling, such as fully differential amplifiers, \\"Fully differential current-input CMOS amplifier front-endsuppressing mixed signal substrate noise for optoelectronic applications\\" by Chang, J.J.; Myunghee Lee; Sungyong Jung; Brooke, M.A.; Jokerst, N.M.; Wills, D.S. 1999 P+ guard-rings, \\"Substrate noise issues in mixed-signal chip designs using Spice\\" by Singh, R.; Sali, S. 1997 differential topology, on-chip decoupling, and triple-well isolation. \\"Mixed-Signal IC Merges 14-Bit ADC With DSP In 0.18-Œºm CMOS\\" Commercial examples * ICsense * AnSem * RF CMOS (used for RF circuits in wireless communications) * List of sound chips ** Yamaha FM synthesis sound chips ** Atari POKEY ** MOS Technology SID * PSoCCypress PSoC Programmable System on Chip * Silego Technology Inc. * System to ASIC * Texas Instruments' MSP430 * Triad Semiconductor * Wolfson Microelectronics * EnSilica Most modern radio and telecommunications use mixed-signal circuits. History =MOS switched- capacitor circuits= The metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1959, and the MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) chip was proposed soon after, but MOS technology was initially overlooked by Bell because they did not find it practical for analog telephone applications, before it was commercialized by Fairchild and RCA for digital electronics such as computers. MOS technology eventually became practical for telephony applications with the MOS mixed-signal integrated circuit, which combines analog and digital signal processing on a single chip, developed by former Bell engineer David A. Hodges with Paul R. Gray at UC Berkeley in the early 1970s. In 1974, Hodges and Gray worked with R.E. Suarez to develop MOS switched capacitor (SC) circuit technology, which they used to develop a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, using MOS capacitors and MOSFET switches for data conversion. MOS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and DAC chips were commercialized by 1974. MOS SC circuits led to the development of pulse-code modulation (PCM) codec-filter chips in the late 1970s. The silicon- gate CMOS (complementary MOS) PCM codec-filter chip, developed by Hodges and W.C. Black in 1980, has since been the industry standard for digital telephony. By the 1990s, telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) had been largely digitized with very-large- scale integration (VLSI) CMOS PCM codec-filters, widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges, private branch exchanges (PBX) and key telephone systems (KTS); user-end modems; data transmission applications such as digital loop carriers, pair gain multiplexers, telephone loop extenders, integrated services digital network (ISDN) terminals, digital cordless telephones and digital cell phones; and applications such as speech recognition equipment, voice data storage, voice mail and digital tapeless answering machines. The bandwidth of digital telecommunication networks has been rapidly increasing at an exponential rate, as observed by Edholm's law, largely driven by the rapid scaling and miniaturization of MOS technology. =RF CMOS circuits= While working at Bell Labs in the early 1980s, Pakistani engineer Asad Abidi worked on the development of sub-micron MOSFET (metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor) VLSI (very large-scale integration) technology at the Advanced LSI Development Lab, along with Marty Lepselter, George E. Smith and Harry Bol. As one of the few circuit designers at the lab, Abidi demonstrated the potential of sub-micron NMOS integrated circuit technology in high-speed communication circuits, and developed the first MOS amplifiers for Gb/s data rates in optical fiber receivers. Abidi's work was initially met with skepticism from proponents of GaAs and bipolar junction transistors, the dominant technologies for high-speed circuits at the time. In 1985 he joined UCLA, where he pioneered RF CMOS technology in the late 1980s. His work changed the way in which RF circuits would be designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits. Abidi was researching analog CMOS circuits for signal processing and communications during the late 1980s to early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, the RF CMOS technology that he pioneered was widely adopted in wireless networking, as mobile phones began entering widespread use. As of 2008, the radio transceivers in all wireless networking devices and modern mobile phones are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices. The baseband processors and radio transceivers in all modern wireless networking devices and mobile phones are mass-produced using RF CMOS devices. RF CMOS circuits are widely used to transmit and receive wireless signals, in a variety of applications, such as satellite technology (such as GPS), bluetooth, Wi-Fi, near-field communication (NFC), mobile networks (such as 3G and 4G), terrestrial broadcast, and automotive radar applications, among other uses. RF CMOS technology is crucial to modern wireless communications, including wireless networks and mobile communication devices.

Instead, such a marriage is entered into for personal gain or some other sort of strategic purpose, such as political marriage. Some cases in which those married do not intend to live together as a couple, typically marry only for one of them to gain the right to reside in a country. In many cultures it is usual for parents to decide their adult children's marriages; this is called arranged marriage. A marriage of convenience that is neither a sham marriage entered into for fraudulent purposes or a forced marriage is not against the law. Legal loophole Operation by officers from the UK Border Agency at Oxford Registry Office on 8 June 2010 to stop a suspected sham marriage Marriages of convenience are often contracted to exploit legal loopholes of various sorts. A couple may wed for one of them to gain citizenship or right of abode (This has been depicted in TV shows such as On the Wings of Love; where marriage is purposely undertaken to gain residency), for example, as many countries around the world will grant such rights to anyone married to a resident citizen. In the United States, this practice is known as a green card marriage. In Australia, there have been marriages of convenience to bring attention to the government's Youth Allowance laws. On 31 March 2010 two students were publicly and legally married on the University of Adelaide's lawn so that they could both receive full Youth Allowance.Hood, Lucy, \\"Students marry to highlight youth allowance inconsistencies\\", The Advertiser, Adelaide, Australia, April 1, 2010 In the United States during the era of the Vietnam War, some couples were wed during the man's time of exposure to the military draft; the couple agreed to no contact, followed by an annulment at the end of the (typically one year) marriage. Advertisements were commonly placed in student newspapers to this effect. Because they exploit legal loopholes, sham marriages of convenience often have legal consequences. For example, U.S. Immigration (USCIS) can punish this with a US$250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence.US Department of Justice, \\"1948 Marriage Fraud‚Äî8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1325(c) and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1546\\", US Attorneys Manual, Title 9, Criminal Resource Manual. > The Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments Act of 1986 amended ¬ß 1325 by > adding ¬ß 1325(c), which provides a penalty of five years' imprisonment and a > $250,000 fine for any \\"individual who knowingly enters into a marriage for > the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws.\\" USCIS, \\"11 Arrested, Indicted in Multi-State Operation Targeting Visa and Mail Fraud\\". > \\"The maximum sentences for the above charges are: > * Conspiracy: 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine * Mail fraud: 20 years > in prison and a $250,000 fine * Wire fraud: 20 years in prison and a > $250,000 fine * False statement in immigration matter: 10 years in prison > and a $250,000 fine\\" Fraudulent marriage is any marriage that has been entered into with the sole purpose of circumventing the law. According to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Act 255 [8 U.S.C 1325], the consequences of entering into a marriage in order to evade the law include incarceration for up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. Homosexuality Another common reason for marriages of convenience is to hide one partner's homosexuality in places where being openly gay is punishable or potentially detrimental. A sham marriage of this type, sometimes called a lavender marriage, is intended to hide the appearance of homosexuality. Such marriages may have one heterosexual and one gay partner, or two gay partners: a lesbian and a gay man married to each other. In the case where a gay man marries a woman, the woman is said to be his \\"beard\\". In recent years, such marriages are conducted to make a political point about the absence of marriage equality in a particular country. Metaphorical usage The phrase \\"marriage of convenience\\" has also been generalized to mean any partnership between groups or individuals for their mutual (and sometimes illegitimate) benefit, or between groups or individuals otherwise unsuited to working together. An example would be a \\"national unity government\\", as existed in Israel during much of the 1980s or in Great Britain during World War II. More specifically, cohabitation refers to a political situation which can occur in countries with a semi-presidential system (especially France), where the president and the prime minister belong to opposed political camps. Political marriage Marriages of convenience, often termed marriages of state, have always been commonplace in royal, aristocratic, and otherwise powerful families, to make alliances between two powerful houses. Examples include the marriages of Agnes of Courtenay, her daughter Sibylla, Jeanne d'Albret, and Catherine of Aragon (twice).

He reigned for 48 years, from c. 2094 ‚Äì c. 2047 BC (Middle Chronology) or possibly c. 2029 ‚Äì 1982 BC (Short Chronology). His accomplishments include the completion of construction of the Great Ziggurat of Ur, begun by his father Ur-Nammu. On his inscriptions, he took the titles \\"King of Ur\\", \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" and \\"King of the four corners of the universe\\". He used the symbol for divinity () before his name, marking his apotheosis, from the 23rd year of his reign. Life and work Shulgi was the son of Ur-Nammu king of Ur ‚Äì according to one later text (CM 48), by a daughter of the former king Utu-hengal of Uruk ‚Äì and was a member of the Third dynasty of Ur. Year-names are known for all 48 years of his reign, providing a fairly complete contemporary view of the highlights of his career. Shulgi is best known for his extensive revision of the scribal school's curriculum. Although it is unclear how much he actually wrote, there are numerous praise poems written by and directed towards this ruler. He proclaimed himself a god in his 23rd regnal year.Van De Mieroop, Marc. (2005). A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000‚Äì323 BC, Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 76 Some early chronicles castigate Shulgi for his impiety: The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19) states that \\"he did not perform his rites to the letter, he defiled his purification rituals\\". CM 48 charges him with improper tampering with the rites, composing \\"untruthful stelae, insolent writings\\" on them. The Chronicle of Early Kings (ABC 20) accuses him of \\"criminal tendencies, and the property of Esagila and Babylon he took away as booty.\\" =Name= Early uncertainties about the reading of cuneiform led to the readings \\"Shulgi\\" and \\"Dungi\\" being common transliterations before the end of the 19th century. However, over the course of the 20th century, the scholarly consensus gravitated away from dun towards shul as the correct pronunciation of the sign. The spelling of Shulgi's name by scribes with the diƒùir determinative reflects his deification during his reign, a status and spelling previously claimed by his Akkadian predecessor Naram-Sin. File:Portraits of Shulgi.jpgPortraits of Shulgi from his Nuska seal. Louvre Museum File:Portrait of Shulgi as a builder, on a foundation nail.jpgPortrait of Shulgi as a builder, on a foundation nail. Metropolitan Museum of Art =Personal glorification= Text of the \\"Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)\\". Shulgi also boasted about his ability to maintain high speeds while running long distances. He claimed in his 7th regnal year to have run from Nippur to Ur, a distance of not less than 100 miles.Hamblin, William J. Warfare in the Ancient Near East to 1600 BC. New York: Routledge, 2006. Kramer refers to Shulgi as \\"The first long distance running champion.\\"See his History Begins at Sumer, Chapter 31, \\"Shulgi of Ur: The First Long-Distance Champion\\". Shulgi wrote a long royal hymn to glorify himself and his actions, in which he refers to himself as \\"the king of the four quarters, the pastor of the black-headed people\\".\\"I am the king of the four quarters, I am a shepherd, the pastor of the \\"black-headed people\\"\\" in Shulgi claimed that he spoke Elamite as well as he spoke Sumerian. =Armed conflicts= While Der had been one of the cities whose temple affairs Shulgi had directed in the first part of his reign, in his 20th year he claimed that the gods had decided that it now be destroyed, apparently as some punishment. The inscriptions state that he \\"put its field accounts in order\\" with the pick-axe. His 18th year-name was Year Liwir- mitashu, the king's daughter, was elevated to the ladyship in Marhashi, referring to a country east of Elam and her dynastic marriage to its king, Libanukshabash. Following this, Shulgi engaged in a period of expansionism at the expense of highlanders such as the Lullubi, and destroyed Simurrum (another mountain tribe) and Lulubum nine times between the 26th and 45th years of his reign. In his 30th year, his daughter was married to the governor of Anshan; in his 34th year, he was already levying a punitive campaign against the place. He also destroyed Kimash and Humurtu (cities to the east of Ur, somewhere in Elam) in the 45th year of his reign. Ultimately, Shulgi was never able to rule any of these distant peoples; at one point, in his 37th year, he was obliged to build a large wall in an attempt to keep them out. =Susa= Shulgi is known to have made dedications at Susa, as foundation nails with his name, dedicated to god Inshushinak have been found there. One of the votive foundation nails reads: \\"The god 'Lord of Susa,' his king, Shulgi, the mighty male, king of Ur, king of Sumer and Akkad, the..., his beloved temple, built.\\". An etched carnelian bead, now located in the Louvre Museum (Sb 6627) and inscribed with a dedication by Shulgi was also found in Susa, the inscription reading: \\"Ningal, his mother, Shulgi, god of his land, King of Ur, King of the four world quarters, for his life dedicated (this)\\". The Ur III dynasty had held control over Susa since the demise of Puzur- Inshushinak, and they built numerous buildings and temples there. This control was continued by Shulgi as shown by his numerous dedications in the city- state. He also engaged in marital alliances, by marrying his daughters to rulers of eastern territories, such as Anshan, Marhashi and Bashime.

He improved communications, reorganized the army, reformed the writing system and weight and measures, unified the tax system and created a strong bureaucracy. He also promulgated the law code known as the Code of Ur-Nammu after his father. Year names One of the terracotta tablets listing the Year names of Shulgi, from year 6 (íà¨íÑäíÇóíÜ§íÜ†[íã´...]: \\"The year the road from Nippur [was straightened]\\") to year 21a in this view, the other year names being inscribed on the back. A fragment is missing in this tablet (at the top), corresponding to the first five year names and the last seven year names of Shulgi. This is an Old Babylonian copy (ca. 1900-1600 BCE) of an Akkadian original. Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul. There are extensive remains for the year names of Shulgi, which have been entirely reconstructed from year 1 to year 48. Some of the most important are: Marriage with a princess from Mari Shulgi was a contemporary of the Shakkanakku rulers of Mari, particularly Apil-kin and Iddi-ilum. An inscription mentions that Taram- Uram, the daughter of Apil-kin, became the \\"daughter-in-law\\" of Ur-Nammu, and therefore the Queen of king Shulgi. In the inscription, she called herself \\"daughter-in-law of Ur-Nammu\\", and \\"daughter of Apil-kin, Lugal (\\"King\\") of Mari\\", suggesting for Apil-kin a position as a supreme ruler, and pointing to a marital alliance between Mari and Ur.

Early work in this field was carried out by George Placzek, who developed the theoretical treatment of bond polarizability. The Raman scattered light is emitted by the stimulation of the electric field of the incident light. Therefore, the direction of the vibration of the electric field, or polarization direction, of the scattered light might be expected to be the same as that of the incident light. In reality, however, some fraction of the Raman scattered light has a polarization direction that is perpendicular to that of the incident light. This component is called the perpendicular component. Naturally, the component of the Raman scattered light whose polarization direction is parallel to that of the incident light is called the parallel component, and the Raman scattered light consists of the parallel component and the perpendicular component. The ratio of the peak intensity of the parallel and perpendicular component is known as the depolarization ratio (œÅ), defined in equation 1. For example, a spectral band with a peak of intensity 10 units when the polarizers are parallel, and intensity 1 unit when the polarizers are perpendicular, would have a depolarization ratio of 1/10 = 0.1, which corresponds to a highly polarized band. The value of the depolarization ratio of a Raman band depends on the symmetry of the molecule and the normal vibrational mode, in other words, the point group of the molecule and its irreducible representation to which the normal mode belongs. Under Placzek‚Äôs polarizability approximation, it is known that the depolarization ratio of a totally symmetric vibrational mode is less than 0.75, and that of the other modes equals 0.75. A Raman band whose depolarization ratio is less than 0.75 is called a polarized band, and a band with a depolarization ratio equal to or greater than 0.75 is called a depolarized band. For a spherical top molecule in which all three axes are equivalent, symmetric vibrations have Raman spectral bands which are completely polarized (œÅ = 0). An example is the symmetric stretching or \\"breathing\\" mode of methane (CH4) in which all 4 C‚ÄìH bonds vibrate in phase. However for the asymmetric mode in which one C‚ÄìH bond stretches while the other three contract, the Raman scattered radiation is depolarized. For molecules of lower symmetry (symmetric tops or asymmetric tops), a vibration with the full symmetry of the molecule leads to a polarized or partially polarized Raman band (œÅ < 0.75), while a less symmetric vibration yields a depolarized band (œÅ ‚â• 0.75).

He was the WBA's world Welterweight champion in 1975-76.http://www.factophile.com/show.content?action=view&pageid;=816 A music lover, Espada also organized, during the late 1970s, a salsa orchestra. Espada's nickname is \\"Cholo\\". Biography =Early career= Espada began his professional boxing career on March 11, 1967, with a defeat at the hands of future Antonio Cervantes world title challenger Josue Marquez, on a six- round decision, at San Juan. His next two fights were declared draws (ties). Both were against Luis Vinales. After another defeat and a draw (both against Chris Fernandez), Espada got his first win. On April 1, 1968, he knocked out Linfer Contreras in the first round in San Juan. After one more win, he fought outside Puerto Rico for the first time, losing on points after six rounds to future Roberto Dur√°n world title challenger Jimmy Robertson, on September 27, 1969, at Los Angeles, California. His next fight would be against Bobby Joe Hughes, April 9, 1969 in San Juan. Hughes was disqualified for using illegal tactics during the fight, and this victory marked the beginning of a fifteen fight winning streak for Espada. On November 7 of 1970, the streak was stopped by Matt Donovan, who beat him on points over ten rounds. Shortly after, Espada would beat former Emile Griffith world title challenger Manuel Gonzalez and lose to former world champion Eddie Perkins, both times, on points after ten rounds. Between 1972 and 1975, Espada posted twelve wins in a row, including a victory over perennial world title challenger Armando Muniz, and a win in Panama. He was beaten by Luis Acosta in Caracas by decision in ten rounds to stop that winning streak, but he avenged the defeat against Acosta with a ten- round win over him in a rematch held in San Juan. =Champion= Espada became a world champion in a situation that could be described by some as bizarre: the undisputed world Welterweight champion of the era, Jos√© N√°poles, was to fight Carlos Monz√≥n for the world's Middleweight title. The WBC kept recognizing N√°poles as their world Welterweight champion, but the WBA, feeling that Espada deserved a chance at N√°poles' crown, decided to strip N√°poles of the world championship because N√°poles went ahead as planned and fought Monzon. Thus, on June 28, 1975, Espada became the WBA's world Welterweight champion, and Puerto Rico's fourth world boxing champion in history, by outpointing the well known Canadian, Clyde Gray, over fifteen rounds in San Juan. He retained the title with a fifteen-round decision over Johnny Gant, and won a non-title fight with an eighth-round knockout over Alfonzo Hayman. On July 11, 1976, Espada fought what would have been the start of a Mexican boxing tour. Espada, looking forward to meeting Miguel Campanino, was instead faced with a boxer who had a record of 16-5 and who was named Jos√© Cuevas. Cuevas lifted the WBA world Welterweight title away from Espada with a second- round knockout. They would fight again twice, with Cuevas retaining the title by ten and eleven-round knockouts. =Retirement from the Ring= Towards the end of his career, Espada, realizing his best days as a boxer had probably passed him by, announced on the Vea magazine that he was putting together a salsa orchestra. The \\"Cholo Espada orchestra\\" had some success in Puerto Rico, appearing on television shows constantly during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Espada lost his last important fight, against Thomas Hearns, by a knockout in round four at the Joe Louis Arena, in Detroit, on March 2 of 1980. He then retired for a short period of time. Espada wanted to retire as a winner, however, and, after one year of inactivity, he made a one fight comeback, knocking out Julio Alfonso in four rounds, on December 10, 1981, in San Juan. After retiring from boxing, Espada became a boxing trainer, and he has remained in that position ever since. Espada had a record of 44 wins, 11 losses and 3 draws, with 27 wins by knockout.

The Imperial Family of Japan traditionally has supported the society, with the Empress as Honorary President and other imperial family members as vice presidents. Its headquarters is located in Tokyo and local chapters are set up in all 47 prefectures. 9,610,000 individual and 120,000 corporate members belong to the society, which operates 92 Red Cross hospitals and 79 blood centers all over the country. The Japanese Red Cross Society conducts relief activities when major disasters take place. Large earthquakes which frequently occur in Japan (such as the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami) are an area of work for the society.  History  Flag of the Red Cross Hakuai Sha - used by the organization until 1887 Count Sano Tsunetami founded the , a relief organization for the injured of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877; a modified version of the Japanese flag was used by the organization until 1887.Hakuai Sha (Flags of the world - Japanese Red Cross Society) Its name was changed to the Japanese Red Cross Society on 2 September 1887 following Japan's admission to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Later that year, the Society engaged in its first disaster relief after the eruption of Mount Bandai. From the beginning, the Japanese Imperial family, especially Empress Sh≈çken, provided active support for Red Cross activities. The attendance of the imperial family made membership in the Society socially attractive to members of the kazoku aristocracy and leading members of society. By the start of the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), the Japanese Red Cross Society was the largest in the world, with over a million members. p.314. The Society played an outstanding role with regards to the many Russian prisoners of war, gaining Japan a considerable amount of good public relations in the western press. This image was cultivated by the hosting of volunteer nurses and medical staff from the United States, France, Germany and Great Britain. A report from Anita Newcomb McGee on conditions in Japan was instrumental in obtaining government assistance in the revitalization of the American Red Cross. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the Japanese Red Cross Society collected $146,000 for the American relief effort, marking the first overseas operation by the Society. In September 1914, during World War I, by request of the Imperial Japanese Army, the Red Cross put together three squads, each composed of one surgeon and twenty nurses, who were dispatched to Europe on a five-month assignment. The teams left Japan between October and December 1914 and were assigned to Petrograd, Paris, and Southampton. The arrival of these nurses received wide press coverage, and their host countries subsequently asked for these teams to extend their assignment to fifteen months. Araki, Eiko: Women Soldiers Delegated to Europe. The Japan Red Cross Relief Corps and the First World War, in: Osaka City University Studies in the Humanities 64 (2013): pp. 5‚Äì35. Meanwhile, within Japan, German prisoners of war, who had been captured at the Battle of Tsingtao, were treated fairly well with the help of the Red Cross. In 1934, the Japanese Red Cross Society hosted the 15th International Conference of the Red Cross at Tokyo. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945), the Japanese Red Cross Society played a vital role in assisting Japanese civilians and wounded soldiers. However, as the Imperial Japanese Army tended to ignore the Geneva Convention, government and military restrictions hampered the ability of the Japanese Red Cross Society to assist the hundreds of thousands of European military and civilians interned in prison camps in the Japanese-occupied areas of Southeast Asia. After World War II, the Japanese Red Cross Society was reformed under American advisers. On 14 August 1952, it was given legal status as a special non-profit corporation.

History  A command that displays the names of users logged in was first implemented within Multics.Multics Commands Later, it appeared in Version 1 Unix and became part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. The version of \`who\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Joseph Arceneaux, David MacKenzie, and Michael Stone.

It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King Ammisaduqa (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after Hammurabi. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC. (according to the Middle Chronology). The tablet recorded the rise times of Venus and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the heliacal risings and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years. The sources This Venus tablet is part of Enuma anu enlil (\\"In the days of Anu and Enlil\\"), a long text dealing with Babylonian astrology, which mostly consists of omens interpreting celestial phenomena. The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC cuneiform, part of the British Museum collections, was recovered from the library at Nineveh. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and George Smith as Enuma Anu Enlil Tablet 63, in \\"Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences\\" (The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, volume III). As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups. The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source \\"B\\", found at Kish in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while Sargon II was King of Assyria between 720 and 704 BC. Interpretation Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, Middle, Low and Ultra-Low Chronologies, were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: 1702 BC, 1646 BC, 1582 BC, and 1550 BC, respectively. The tablet's significance for corroborating Babylonian chronology was first recognised by Franz Xaver Kugler in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic \\"Year of the Golden Throne\\" (\\"Venus\\" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.Franz Xaver Kugler, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel - II.

D, The Venus Tablets - a Fresh Approach, Journal for the History of Astronomy, vol. 13, pp. 23, 1982 Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets. Some copying corruptions are probable. Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by Vahe Gurzadyan in a 2003 publication. The entry for some years, notably 13 and 21 are not physically possible and are considered in error. Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing \\"clock-time errors\\".John D.

At age 16, she married electrician Noble Herman Stephens on December 1, 1954, probably in Memphis. They had one child, Herman Andrew Stephens, who would later be known as actor/producer Andrew Stevens. He is Stella's only child. The couple divorced in 1957 but Stella and her son retained a variation of her ex-husband's surname as their own professional surnames. While studying at Memphis State College, she became interested in acting and modeling. According to her official biography, \\"Her schooling in Memphis, included a couple of years at Memphis State University, where she was noticed in the school play Bus Stop. The Memphis Press-Scimitar review of that performance in Memphis sparked her career.\\" Film career Stevens made her film debut in Say One for Me (1959), a modest musical produced by and starring Bing Crosby, appearing in the minor role of a chorus girl. Stevens' contract with 20th Century-Fox was dropped after six months. After winning the role of Appassionata Von Climax in the musical Li'l Abner (1959), she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures (1959-1963). In 1960, she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress for her performance in Say One for Me, sharing the distinction with fellow up-and-comers Tuesday Weld, Angie Dickinson, and Janet Munro. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s Stevens achieved success as a model. When high-speed Ektachrome film was introduced in 1959, Stevens was the first person ever photographed for a formal portrait by the light of a single candle and several reflectors for the cover of a photography magazine. In January 1960, she was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month, and was also featured in Playboy pictorials in 1965 and 1968. She was included in Playboy's 100 Sexiest Stars of the 20th Century, appearing at number 27. During the 1960s she was one of the most photographed women in the world. In 1961, she starred opposite Bobby Darin in John Cassavetes' Too Late Blues and in 1962, she starred opposite Elvis Presley in Girls! Girls! Girls!. The following year she appeared in two successful comedy films: Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor (1963), as his student and love interest Stella Purdy, and in Vincente Minnelli's The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963), playing the would-be \\"Miss Montana\\" beauty queen. In 1964, she signed a contract with Columbia Pictures (1964‚Äì68). Following appearances in Synanon (1965) and The Secret of My Success (1965), Stevens starred as a sexy but clumsy government agent opposite Dean Martin in the Matt Helm spy spoof The Silencers (1966). Her final film for Columbia was Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows (1968) in which she played \\"Sister George\\". In 1970, Stevens starred opposite Jason Robards in Sam Peckinpah's The Ballad of Cable Hogue, for which she received positive reviews. In his review in The New York Times, Roger Greenspun wrote, \\"But it is Stella Stevens, at last in a role good enough for her, who most wonderfully sustains and enlightens the action.\\" In 1972 she starred in Irwin Allen's hugely successful disaster film The Poseidon Adventure, starring Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Roddy McDowall and Shelley Winters. Stevens played the role of Linda Rogo, the \\"refreshingly outspoken\\" ex-prostitute wife of Borgnine's character. Although she continued to appear in feature films for the next four decades, Stevens shifted the focus of her career to television series, miniseries and movies. Television career Stella Stevens and Hugh O'Brian, General Electric Theater, 1961 Stevens appeared in several top television series in the 1960s, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1960), General Electric Theater (1960, 1961), and Ben Casey (1964). One of her earliest television appearances was in a critically acclaimed 1960 episode of Bonanza, \\"Silent Thunder\\", playing a deaf mute. In the early 1970s, she began working regularly on television series, miniseries and movies. She appeared in episodes of such popular series as Banacek (1973) and Police Story (1975), as well as the pilot films for Wonder Woman (1975), The Love Boat (1977) and Hart to Hart (1979). In 1979, she appeared along with son Andrew Stevens in The Oregon Trail (1977) episode \\"Hannah's Girl\\". In the 1980s, she continued to work regularly in series such as Newhart (1983), The Love Boat (1983), Fantasy Island (1983), Highway to Heaven (1984), Night Court (1984), Murder, She Wrote (1985), Magnum, P.I. (1986), and Father Dowling Mysteries (1987). Stevens appears in 34 episodes of the prime-time soap opera Flamingo Road (1981‚Äì82), as Lute-Mae Sanders, the former madam of a brothel. From 1989-90, she had a role on Santa Barbara as Phyllis Blake. Her string of appearances on popular television series continued into the 1990s with The Commish (1993), Burke's Law (1994), Highlander: The Series (1995), Silk Stalkings (1996) and General Hospital (1996, 1999). She also appeared in the critically acclaimed miniseries In Cold Blood (1996). Her television career continued into the 2000s when she appeared in an episode of Twenty Good Years (2006). Additional work In the 1960s Stevens was a member of a five-voice vocal ensemble called \\"The Skip-Jacks.\\" That group is best known for performing the theme songs for the television programs The Flintstones and The Patty Duke Show. Stevens appeared in several stage productions, including a touring production of an all-female version of Neil Simon's The Odd Couple opposite Sandy Dennis. Stevens played the Oscar Madison character. She produced and directed two films, The Ranch (1989) and The American Heroine (1979). In 1999, she co-wrote a novel, Razzle Dazzle, about a Memphis-born singer named Johnny Gault. Personal life In late 1976, Stevens purchased a ranch in Methow Valley near Carlton, Washington, on the eastern edge of the Cascade Mountains. She also opened an art gallery and bakery in the nearby small town of Twisp, Washington. In 1983, Stevens began a long-term relationship with rock guitarist Bob Kulick; through at least 1990, they shared Stevens' Beverly Hills home. In 2005, Stevens received the Reel Cowboys Silver Spur Award for her contributions to the Western genre. In early 2015, she and partner Bob Kulick sold her longtime home in Beverly Hills. She is now in a long-term Alzheimer's care facility in Los Angeles and Kulick often visited her there until his death on May 28, 2020.

VHS-C is the compact VHS videocassette format, introduced by Victor Company of Japan (JVC) in 1982, and used primarily for consumer-grade compact analog recording camcorders. The format is based on the same video tape as is used in VHS, and can be played back in a standard VHS VCR with an adapter. Though quite inexpensive, the format is largely obsolete even as a consumer standard and has been replaced in the marketplace by digital video formats, which have smaller form factors. The magnetic tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool and used a gear wheel which moves the tape forward. It can also be moved by hand. This development hampered the sales of the Betamax system somewhat, because the Betamax cassette geometry prevented a similar development. VHS-C cassette was larger than Video8 cassette, but was compatible with VHS tape recorders, using a special adapter cassette. The adapter contains a standard full-size engagement hub for the VCR's takeup sprocket, which connected to a gear train to drive the VHS-C cassette takeup gear. VHS end of tape is normally detected by a light in the VCR that inserts into the full-size cassette body, and detected by sensors in the VCR located at the far outer corners of the front of the cassette. Because the width of VHS-C is narrower than a full-size VHS cassette and does not align with the full-size end of tape sensors, the adapter has a guide roller swing arm to pull tape out of the VHS-C cartridge out to the far right edge where it would normally be located in a full-size cassette. When the VHS-C cartridge is to be removed from the adapter, a geared retraction system pulls in the excess loose tape when the swing arm retracts. A higher quality version of VHS-C was released, based on S-VHS, known as S-VHS-C, that competed against Hi8, the higher quality version of Video8. The arrival on the market of inexpensive S-VHS-C camcorders led to the inclusion on many modern VCRs of a feature known as SQPB, or SuperVHS Quasi-PlayBack, but did not make a significant impact on the market as the arrival of MiniDV as a consumer standard made low-cost, digital, near-broadcast quality video widely available to consumers, and rendered analog camcorders largely obsolete. Compared with Video8, VHS-C had similar video quality but a shorter run time, 90 versus 30 minutes at SP speed (for standard cassettes), 180 versus 60 for longer-running modes. JVC did market 45-minute and 60-minute SP Mode tapes with the Extra High Grade formulation (135 minutes and 180 minutes in EP/SLP Mode) for a time. Similarly, Video8 spawned a 120-minute version of the cassette (240 minutes in long play). A size comparison between the original VHS format, VHS-C, and the more recent MiniDV. The later Hi8 and S-VHS-C systems both have a quality similar to the laserdisc system. Although Video8 acquired a digital variant, Digital8, D-VHS was never adapted to a compact format, as the consumer camcorder industry moved on to small-format MiniDV tapes, then hard-drive- and DVD-based machines, and then solid-state storage. Slackening Problem Early VHS-C cassettes did not have a mechanism to ratchet or lock the supply reel when not in use, making them susceptible to spilling tape inside the shell. Consequently, manufacturers placed a label on their camcorders and adapters to warn the user to check that the tape is not slackened before inserting a cassette. The user could dissipate the slack by manually turning the take-up gear. Later cassettes corrected this problem by adding teeth to the supply reel to lock it in place when no upward pressure is applied. The spindle of the camcorder or VCR supplies pressure to float the reel's turntable and teeth above the shell, allowing it to rotate freely when in use. If a tape with slack was loaded into a VHS-C adapter, the tape could sit on the wrong side of a tape guide when the adapter loaded. The result would be a tape and cassette combination that would not play in a video deck, and would damage the tape to some extent when being unloaded. Write Protect Imperfection VHS-C cassettes have a switch to inhibit recording of a cassette. Not all adapters propagate the state of this switch to the VCR itself, so accidental erasure of a write-protected cassette is possible if the adapter's write protect lug or switch allows it. VHS-C head drum To reduce the size of cameras, the VHS-C mechanism uses a two-thirds size head drum (41.3 mm diameter instead of the original VHS drum size of 62 mm). The wrap angle is 270 degrees instead of VHS's 180 degrees. The drum rotates at a proportionately higher speed, and four rotary video heads are used to trace out exactly the same helical recording path as a standard sized VHS drum. By adding more heads, the same small VHS-C drum can record and playback FM Hi-Fi audio that is also fully compatible with a standard sized Hi-Fi video drum.

It is part of the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It was the first hospital to be established in England dedicated exclusively to treating the diseases of the nervous system. It is closely associated with University College London (UCL) and in partnership with the UCL Institute of Neurology, which occupies the same site, is a major centre for neuroscience research. History The hospital was founded by Johanna Chandler as the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic at Queen Square in 1859. The hospital was completely rebuilt in the early 1880s: the East Wing was re- opened by Princess Helena in 1881 and the West Wing was re-opened by the Prince of Wales in 1885. In 1904, it adopted the name National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of the Paralysed and Epileptic. The hospital served as a section of the First London General Hospital during the First World War and was renamed the National Hospital, Queen Square, for the Relief and Cure of Diseases of the Nervous System including Paralysis and Epilepsy by supplementary Royal Charter in 1926. The Queen Mary Wing was opened by Queen Mary in July 1938. During the Second World War the hospital was badly damaged by German bombing. The hospital merged with the Maida Vale Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System (founded by Julius Althaus as the London Infirmary for Epilepsy and Paralysis in 1866) in 1948, becoming the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases. The current name came into use in 1990. The hospital became part of University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in 1996. Services The hospital includes 244 in-patient beds, and has nine operating theatres (including two angiography theatres). The neurology wards are named John Young and David Ferrier; the neurosurgical wards are named Victor Horsley, Bernard Sunley and Lady Ann Allerton. Nuffield ward accommodates private medical and surgical inpatients. There are neurological and neurosurgical intensive care units in the hospital. The two inpatient rehabilitation units are the Albany Rehabilitation Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit. The main outpatient department is named in memory of Basil Samuels.

The company offers enterprise grade industrial printing solutions. Printronix is based in Irvine, California, and operates across 14 offices worldwide. Products Printronix's printers are primarily used in industrial environments for printing high-volume labels, bar-codes, invoices, manifest and bill of lading documents, delivery sheets, reports, build/broadcast sheets, green bar and bank statements. PrintNet Enterprise Suite (PNE), a web-based application allowing administrators to network and manage all Printronix line-matrix printers from a single computer, was launched in 2007. Printronix also offers consumables, parts, accessories, service and software. History Printronix was founded in 1974 by Robert A. Kleist and business partner Gordon B. Barrus, David Mayne, and three other partners. For three years, 1971‚Äì1974, Gordon B. Barrus worked out of his life-long friend's garage in Playa Del Rey, California, founding what would end up being a nine-figure gross success by 1994 and 1996. The Printronix team worked hard, day and night, and by three years time, Gordon B. Barrus developed and invented what he christened as the P300, a 300-line-per-minute (LPM) prototype line printer series. The company would eventually incorporate, go public on the Nasdaq, and see great success in the coming years with the emergence of the personal computer. Printronix was an astounding plethora of success, more than anyone who founded the baby ever dreamt it would become, all due to the luck of being at the right place at the right time. Back in the days of the late 1900s, there was a capital need for businesses to store all their data via printing, so Gordon B. Barrus took the risk, quit his job at Data Products, and worked on a company he named Eikon. This company would sell industrial-grade printers to businesses to fulfill this need, but lack of investment killed the company, and Gordon started all the way back into his friend's garage to found Printronix. They would gather four other people to get on board with the idea, including Bob A. Kleist, Mel Posin, Ray Melissa, and David Mayne, and by 1996, all of them were laughing all the way to the bank. By then, Printronix would have well over 150M in gross revenue, and everyone at the company was proud of their hard work. But years later, the dream would end, and in January 2008, Printronix was acquired by Vector CapitalPrintronix announces completion of acquisition by Vector Capital and became a private company and in 2009 Printronix acquired its closest competitor, TallyGenicom.Printronix Named Winning Bidder in Acquisition of U.S.-Based Assets of TallyGenicom As a result of the TallyGenicom acquisition, Printronix now owns the intellectual property for the TallyGenicom line printers.

He was born in Dublin but before his second birthday, his family returned to their native County Mayo, settling in the village of Doolough, Kiltane Parish, Erris. He received his primary education at Gweesalia National School, and attended secondary school at St. Muiredach's College, Ballina. He subsequently attended University College Galway, where he studied ancient classics, between 1933 and 1937, graduating with an M.A. He was a noted figure in the college - a gifted orator, he served on the committee of the Literary and Debating Society, and took part in the productions of the Drama Society. He was also a leader of the Blueshirts movement while in college. However, while Lindsay declared himself as being \\"an unrepentant\\" Blueshirt, in his autobiography he denied that himself or many of the membership saw themselves as actual Fascists. Rather that they viewed themselves as a pseudo- paramilitary wing of Cumann na nGaedhael that was a response to the IRA of the 1930s acting as a pseudo-paramilitary wing of Fianna Fail, and in fact, that they saw themselves as Democrats upholding free speech. Lindsay subsequently became a teacher of classics at the Royal School, Cavan, and later at schools in Dublin. He studied law at the King's Inns, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1946. He married Moya Brady in 1952. He was first elected to D√°il √âireann on his sixth attempt, at the 1954 general election as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la (TD) for Mayo North. He was re-elected at the 1957 general election, but lost his seat at the 1961 general election, after which he was elected to the 10th Seanad by the Industrial and Commercial Panel. He became Leas-Chathaoirleach (deputy chairman) of the Seanad. Linday returned to the D√°il at the 1965 general election, but lost his seat at the 1969 general election, when he switched constituency to Dublin North-Central. He was again unsuccessful at the 1973 general election. His ministerial career was brief, lasting only eight months. In July 1956, he was appointed by Taoiseach John A. Costello as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and to the Minister for Education in the Second Inter-Party Government. In October 1956, he was promoted to the cabinet as Minister for the Gaeltacht, serving until March 1957, when Fianna F√°il returned to power after the 1957 general election. On his return to the D√°il in 1965, he was appointed Fine Gael spokesman on transport and power. Lindsay had become a Senior Counsel in 1954, and following the loss of his parliamentary seat in 1969, he devoted himself full- time to his practice at the bar, becoming a leading figure in criminal law. In 1975, he was appointed to the position of Master of the High Court, from which he retired on his seventieth birthday in January 1984. Lindsay served as chairman of Cumann C√©imithe na Gaillimhe, the University College Galway Graduate Association, during the 1980s. He published his memoirs in 1992. He died on 29 June 1993.

It is located in the west-central part of the country in Tr√∏ndelag county, and it stretches from the municipality of √òrland in the west to the municipality of Steinkjer in the north, passing the city of Trondheim on its way. Its maximum depth is , between Orkland and Indre Fosen. The largest islands in the fjord are Ytter√∏ya and Tautra; the small island of Munkholmen is located near the harbor of Trondheim; and there are several islands at the entrance of the fjord. The narrow Skarnsundet is crossed by the Skarnsund Bridge. The part of the fjord to the north of the strait is referred to as the Beitstadfjorden. The main part of the Trondheimsfjord is ice-free all year; only Verrasundet, a long and narrow fjord branch in the northern part of the fjord, might be ice covered in winter. The Beitstadfjorden might also freeze over in winter, but only for a few weeks. The towns of Stj√∏rdalshalsen, Levanger, and Steinkjer are found on the eastern and northeastern shores of the fjord. Aker Verdal in Verdal produces large offshore installations for the petroleum sector. A yard in Indre Fosen completed the luxurious apartment ship MS The World. Fiborgtangen is a peninsula along the eastern shore of the fjord where a large paper mill owned by Norske Skog is located. The Trondheimsfjord has rich marine life, with both southern and northern species; at least 90 species of fish have been observed, and the fjord has the largest biological production among Norway's fjords. In recent years, deep water corals (Lophelia pertusa) were discovered in the fjord, not far from the city of Trondheim. Several of the best salmon rivers in Norway empty into the fjord. Among these are the rivers Gaula (in Orkland just south of Trondheim), Orklaelva (also in Orkland), Stj√∏rdalselva (in Stj√∏rdal), and Verdalselva (in Verdal). The lowland east and south of the fjord represents one of Norway's best agricultural areas. The more rugged and mountainous Fosen peninsula lies to the west and northwest, giving some shelter from the wind common to coastal areas. The Trondheimsfjord was an important waterway in the Viking Age, as it is still today. In 1888, an undersea mudslide caused a tsunami that killed one person in Trondheim and ruptured three railway lines. Four giant squid have been found in the fjord, which is among the highest concentrations in the world. Name The fjord is named after the city of Trondheim, but originally the name of the fjord might have been just *√ûr√≥nd or *√ûr√≥und in Old Norse. A name like that would be related to the verb √ær√≥ast, which means to 'thrive' or 'flourish' and the name √ûr√≥r, which means 'likeable' or 'stoutish' (and was one of Odin's nicknames). If this is the case, then the people living around the fjord (the √ær≈ìndir; see Tr√∏ndelag) named themselves after the fjord. (Compare sygnir, which means 'the people living around the fjord Sogn'.)

The accommodation reflex (or accommodation-convergence reflex) is a reflex action of the eye, in response to focusing on a near object, then looking at a distant object (and vice versa), comprising coordinated changes in vergence, lens shape (accommodation) and pupil size. It is dependent on cranial nerve II (afferent limb of reflex), superior centers (interneuron) and cranial nerve III (efferent limb of reflex). The change in the shape of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles inside the eye. Changes in contraction of the ciliary muscles alter the focal distance of the eye, causing nearer or farther images to come into focus on the retina; this process is known as accommodation. The reflex, controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, involves three responses: pupil constriction, lens accommodation, and convergence. A near object (for example, a computer screen) appears large in the field of vision, and the eye receives light from wide angles. When moving focus from a distant to a near object, the eyes converge. The ciliary muscle constricts making the lens thicker, shortening its focal length. The pupil constricts in order to prevent strongly diverging light rays hitting the periphery of the cornea and the lens from entering the eye and creating a blurred image. Pathway Information from the light on each retina is taken to the occipital lobe via the optic nerve and optic radiation (after a synapse in the lateral geniculate body of the posterior thalamus), where it is interpreted as vision. The peristriate area 19 interprets accommodation, and sends signals via the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the 3rd cranial nerve to the ciliary muscle, the medial rectus muscle and (via parasympathetic fibres) the sphincter pupillae muscle. Pupil constriction and lens accommodation During the accommodation reflex, the pupil constricts to increase the depth of focus of the eye by blocking the light scattered by the periphery of the cornea. The lens then increases its curvature to become more biconvex, thus increasing refractive power. The ciliary muscles are responsible for the lens accommodation response. Convergence Convergence is the ability of the eye to simultaneously demonstrate inward movement of both eyes toward each other. This is helpful in effort to make focus on near objects clearer. Three reactions occur simultaneously; the eyes adduct, the ciliary muscles contract, and the pupils become smaller. This action involves the contraction of the medial rectus muscles of the two eyes and relaxation of the lateral rectus muscles. The medial rectus attaches to the medial aspect of the eye and its contraction adducts the eye. The medial rectus is innervated by motor neurons in the oculomotor nucleus and nerve. Focus on near objects The refractive index of the eye‚Äôs lens system allows the eye to produce sharply focused images. For example, geometrical optics show that as a distant object is brought closer to the eye, the focus of the object becomes blurrier in the plane behind the retina; however, as a result of the increase in the refractive power of the eye, this image becomes clear. The refractive power mainly resides in the cornea, but the changes in refractive power of the eye is achieved by the lens changing its shape. In order to fixate on a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts around the lens to decrease its size. The suspensory zonules of Zinn relax and the radial tension around the lens is released. This causes the lens to form a more spherical shape achieving a higher level of refractive power. Focus on distant objects When the eye focuses on distant objects, the lens holds itself in a flattened shape due to traction from the suspensory ligaments. Ligaments pull the edges of the elastic lens capsule towards the surrounding ciliary body and by opposing the internal pressure within the elastic lens, keep it relatively flattened. Opposite of fixating on a near object, the ciliary muscle relaxes and the diameter of the lens increases to increase the lens‚Äô size. The tension along the suspensory ligaments is increased to flatten the lens and decrease the curvature and achieve a lower refractive power. Neural circuit Three regions make up the accommodation neural circuit, the afferent limb, the efferent limb and the ocular motor neurons that are between the afferent and efferent limb. ; The afferent limb of the circuit : This limb contains the main structures; the retina that contains the retinal ganglion axons in the optic nerve, chiasm and tract, the lateral geniculate body, and the visual cortex. ; The efferent limb of the circuit : This limb includes Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the oculomotor neurons. The main function of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus is to send axons in the oculomotor nerve to control the ciliary ganglion which in turn, sends its axons in the short ciliary nerve to control the iris and the ciliary muscle of the eye. The oculomotor neurons functions to send its axons in the oculomotor nerve, to control the medial rectus, and converge the two eyes. ; Ocular motor control neurons : Neurons that are interposed between the afferent and efferent limbs of this circuit and include the visual association cortex, which determines the image is \\"out-of-focus, and sends corrective signals via the internal capsule and crus cerebri to the supraoculomotor nuclei. It also includes the supraoculomotor nuclei (located immediately superior to the oculomotor nuclei) that generates motor control signals that initiate the accommodation response and sends these control signals bilaterally to the oculomotor complex.

He has been described as one of a number of early Labour parliamentarians whom promoted Christian Socialism.'T. J Murphy' by Eamonn Kirwan  Early life  He was born in Clondrohid, County Cork,Cadogan, Tim & Falvey, Jeremiah: A Biographical Dictionary of Cork, Four Courts Press (2006), and moved to Dunmanway, County Cork around 1920, having been earlier educated at the Clondrohid and Macroom National Schools. In his teens he was influenced by the activities of the Irish Land and Labour Association as well as the politics of William O'Brien. During these years he became involved in trade union and with the Labour Party. He has been credited with recruiting fellow Clondrohid native, Timothy Quill into the Labour Party.  Political career  = TD and councillor (1923‚Äì1949) = He was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1923 general election as a TD for Cork West. He was re-elected for this constituency as a Labour Party TD at the next nine general elections, until his death, but remained on the opposition benches of the D√°il until 1948 when the Labour Party joined the First Inter-Party Government. The Taoiseach John A. Costello then appointed him as Minister for Local Government in February of that year. He had also sat on the Cork County Council from 1925, as acting Chairperson in 1947, but resigned on being appointed to the Cabinet. Murphy advocated for Christian Socialism and the co-operative movement and listed Labour movements in the UK, New Zealand and Australia as good examples. Michael O'Riordan controversy (1944)  Murphy has been described as having been involved in the controversy surrounding the Liam Mellow branch of the Labour Party and Michael O'Riordan. A report in The Irish Press suggested that the Administrative Council had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch. This was headed up by Murphy as Vice-Chair. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. Following an investigation, the two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Murphy, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views. = Cabinet: Minister for Local Government (1948‚Äì1949) = Local Authority Manager Philip Monahan told Cork Corporation in 1948 that an experiment to build houses by direct labour had been suggested by Murphy. To proceed with the direct labour experiment, the City Manager was in the process of appointing an assistant architect, a draughtsman, an assistant engineer and a foreman. Concurrently, Monahan had decided to build other houses by contract so that the Corporation could then decide if one method was superior to the other. A deputation of the Cork Regional Branch of the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland appeared before the meeting to protest this direct labour policy, but the Corporation agreed to proceed with the project as outlined by the City Manager.  Death  Murphy died suddenly in 1949 while speaking at an Inter- Party public meeting at Pearse Square, Fermoy, fourteen months into his tenure as a Cabinet Minister. Following a state funeral, he was buried in Dunmanway Cemetery. The by-election for his seat in the D√°il was held on 15 June 1949, and won for the Labour Party by William J. Murphy. His brief time as minister had seen him initiate a comprehensive house-building programme, designed to tackle the country's considerable housing shortage. By 1951, some 12,000 new houses had been constructed.  Legacy  An area of Murphy's home town of Dunmanway today bears the name \\"T.J. Murphy Place\\".

CSX pulling the Tropicana Juice Train across the Manatee River Bridge in Bradenton, Florida in 2018. \\"Juice Train\\" (or \\"Orange Juice Train\\") is the popular name for famous unit trains of Tropicana fresh orange juice operated by railroads in the United States. Tropicana Products was founded in 1947 in Bradenton, Florida, by Anthony T. Rossi, an Italian immigrant, growing from 50 employees to over 8,000 in 2004. Early distribution of fresh orange juice was by way of hand-delivered juice jars to nearby homes, but demand grew, especially in New York City. By 1957, a ship, S.S. Tropicana was taking of juice to New York each week. In 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via insulated boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Florida to Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around of juice. On June 7, 1971 the \\"Great White Juice Train\\" (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 100-ton insulated boxcars fabricated in the Alexandria, Virginia shops of Fruit Growers Express) commenced service over the 1,250-mile (2,012-kilometer) route. An additional 100 cars were soon incorporated into the fleet, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant on hot days. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs alone during the first ten years in operation. Starting out on Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL) south of Tampa, Florida, the original used former Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) tracks. It crossed over to the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac (RF&P;) in Richmond, Virginia at pier 5 of the famous concrete James River Bridge. At Potomac Yard, in Alexandria, Virginia, Penn Central Transportation (PC) took over and operated it under the overhead wire with electric locomotives most of the way to Kearny. There have been more than a few changes over the years. Tropicana, now a division of PepsiCo, became the world's leading producer of branded fruit juices. In 1976, Conrail (CR) took over from ill-fated Penn Central, with electrification discontinued in 1981. SCL became part of CSX Corporation (CSX) in 1980, and was successively merged into Seaboard System Railroad (SBD) and then CSX Transportation, which also included RF&P; by 1991. In 1997, a second Juice Train began serving Cincinnati, Ohio. When CSX acquired part of Conrail in 1999, an all-CSX train began traveling to a new larger facility in Jersey City, New Jersey on the National Docks Secondary. refrigerated box car, shortly after being donated to the Florida Gulf Coast Railroad Museum ‚Äî Parrish, Florida. Rolling stock has also changed, including orange, white, and blue cars, some with innovative refrigeration. Designated \\"TPIX\\" they are custom-built to Tropicana's specification. The Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) is now carrying Tropicana cars from a second processing facility in Fort Pierce, Florida. A reliable and economically viable transport mode, the Juice Trains are also a powerful mode of advertising, running ten trips each week to Jersey City and Cincinnati. Additional shipments with specially-equipped refrigerated cars now travel by rail to California. Tropicana had its own GE 70-ton locomotive, No. 98, to switch cars at the New Jersey destination. In the 21st century, the Tropicana-CSX Juice Trains have been the focus of efficiency studies and have received awards. They are considered good examples of how modern rail transportation can compete successfully with trucking and other modes to carry perishable products. In 2017 CSX abolished separate Juice Trains between Philadelphia and Florida. Tropicana products are now carried on other CSX trains to and from Florida. A separate train for Tropicana operates over the short distance north of Philadelphia.

It is a dual-stick shooter in the same vein as 1982's Robotron: 2084 (co-created by Jarvis). The Super NES, Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear versions were titled Super Smash TV. The plot centers on a dystopia during the then-future year of 1999, where one or two \\"lucky\\" contestants must shoot their way to fame and fortune (one for moving, avoiding enemies and collecting prizes, and the other for firing); the show is filmed in front of a live studio audience with broadcast via satellite worldwide. The goal of the game show is to kill or be killed, and once all of the challengers in each arena have been massacred, the contestant(s) will proceed to survive the next gauntlet. Gameplay The play mechanic is similar to that of Eugene Jarvis' earlier Robotron: 2084, with dual-joystick controls and series of single- screen arenas. While most of the enemies Robotron are visible at the start of a level, in Smash TV they are generated in waves as a level progresses. Power- ups, some of which give the player a new weapon, are picked up by running over them. The themes were borrowed from violent, sci-fi films such as RoboCop and The Running Man, involves players competing in a violent game show, set in the not-too-distant future. Moving from one room to the next, players have to shoot hordes of enemies who enter via passages on each side of the screen while also collecting weapons, power-up items, and gift-wrapped prizes. The final room in each level is a protracted fight with a boss. At the end of the game is a showdown with the show's host where players are finally granted their life and freedom. Among the game's items are keys. If enough are collected, players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome. Arcade screenshot The game features verbal interjections from the gameshow host such as \\"Total Carnage! I love it!\\" and \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\". The first of these became the title of the 1992 follow-up, Total Carnage. Development Mark Turmell recounted, \\"When Hasbro pulled the plug on an interactive movie project I was working on, I went to Williams to design coin-op games. I moved to Chicago, hired John Tobias, and together we did our first coin-op, Smash T.V.\\" The announcer in the game is voiced by sound designer Paul Heitsch. The script was created by the game's sole composer and sound designer Jon Hey. Originally the arcade game shipped without the Pleasure Dome bonus level implemented, although there was text mentioning it in the game. The design team had not been sure that players would actually get to the end of the game. However, players did finish the game and after arcade operators informed Williams of player complaints of being unable to finish it, the company sent out a new revision that included the Pleasure Dome level. Ports Smash TV was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Game Gear, Master System, and Sega Genesis consoles. Ocean published ports for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga, all released in early 1992. On some home systems such as the NES, players have the option to use the directional pad on the second controller to control the direction the character will shoot on-screen. Using this option for both players requires a multitap. The dual control aspect of the game works particularly well on the SNES, as its four main buttons, A, B, X and Y, are laid out like a D-pad, enabling the player to shoot in one direction while running in another. Reception The home versions of Smash TV received mixed to positive reviews. The Amiga version scored 895 out of a possible 1,000 in a UK magazine review,Douglas, Jim (December 1991). Smash TV (review of Amiga version). ACE (UK magazine published by EMAP), pp. 80‚Äì85. and the Spectrum magazine CRASH awarded the ZX version 97%, making it a Crash Smash. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed Smash TV as the 6th best arcade game of all time. Legacy The 1992 Williams arcade game Total Carnage shares many elements with Smash TV and was also programmed by Turmell, but is not a sequel. =Re-releases= Smash TV is part of Arcade Party Pak released for the PlayStation in 1999. It is included in the Midway Arcade Treasures collection, which is available for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was released in 2003. These versions give the player the option to save high scores. Smash TV is also part of the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins. Smash TV was made available for download through Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 and was the first version of the game to officially allow two players to play the game online. It was delisted from the service in February 2010 after the dissolution of Midway Games.

Rebuilt from the keel of the first at Gosport (later Norfolk) Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia beginning in 1832, the new Macedonian was launched and placed in service in 1836, with Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones in command. Service history =West Indies Squadron= Macedonian was assigned to the West Indies Squadron to cruise in the West Indies and along the west coast of Africa from 1839 to 1847 as a continuing deterrent to Caribbean pirates. By a joint resolution of Congress on 3 March 1847 Macedonian and sloop-of-war were placed in civilian hands to carry food to Ireland during the Great Famine of the late 1840s. With a volunteer crew, Macedonian, Captain George C. De Kay in command, departed New York on 15 June with 12,000 barrels of provisions for Ireland donated by private citizens of the United States, returning to Brooklyn Navy Yard some months later to resume navy service. =Expedition to Japan= In 1852 Macedonian docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to be razeed and converted to a sloop-of-war for Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition to Japan. Assigned as part of the East India Squadron under command of Captain Joel Abbot, was one of the ten American ships entering Edo Bay, Japan, on 13 February 1854 during Perry's second visit to negotiate the opening of Japan to foreign trade, remaining as part of the show of force under the Convention of Kanagawa signed at Yokohama on 31 March 1854. Macedonian remained on patrol in the North Pacific for the next three years. Then, from 1857 to 1861 she served with the Home Squadron in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. On 26 October 1858 she assisted with the refloated of , which had run aground on the Pelican Shoal, off Smyrna, Ottoman Empire. =Civil war= Dale, and the Savannah anchored at the south wharf of West Point, on the Hudson River, New York With the American Civil War looming just ahead, the frigate departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for Pensacola, Florida, on 12 January 1861 to join in preventing a possible Confederate attack on the harbor. On 11 February Macedonian sailed for Veracruz, Mexico, arriving on the 24th. She then began patrol operations along the gulf coast and the coast of South America, with stops at Aspinwall (later Col√≥n, Panama) and Portobelo, Panama; Martinique; and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. On 3 December she got underway with from St. Thomas for the east coast, arriving Boston Navy Yard on 16 January 1862. Macedonian spent most of the next two years with the West Indies Squadron. In July 1863 she cruised along the coast of Portugal with sloop-of-war hunting Confederate States ship . It was around then that Alfred Thayer Mahan served aboard for a brief time. From the end of that year through 1870, Macedonian served as school and practice ship for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, first at Newport, Rhode Island, then after the civil war at Annapolis, Maryland. In 1871 she was laid up in ordinary at the Norfolk Navy Yard, where she was sold to Wiggin and Robinson for merchant service. =Post-navy= There is no record of Macedonian having actually sailed as a merchant ship, and the next reference to the ship, in 1900, mentions her as having been converted into the Macedonia Hotel at City Island, Bronx. The hotel was sold in 1912 and renamed the City Island Casino, but burned down on 9 June 1922. The naval origin of the Macedonian Hotel was mentioned in a Ripley's Believe It or Not item in 1983.

It is part of the Four Heatons, and neighbours Heaton Chapel, Heaton Mersey and Heaton Moor. Formerly a parish of Lancashire, in 1835 part of Heaton Norris was annexed to the County Borough of Stockport; Heaton Chapel and Heaton Moor remained in Lancashire, but further territory was ceded in 1894 and the remnant in 1913.  History  Historically part of Lancashire, Heaton Norris was part of the Manchester barony of the Grelley family, but between 1162 and 1180 it belonged to William le Norreys. Heaton Moor Conservation Area Appraisal In the early 13th century, Heaton Norris, a sub manor of Manchester, encompassed all of the Four Heatons. It was escheated (i.e. reverted) to the manor of Manchester around 1280. In 1322, there were 32 dwellings suggesting a population of 150, the ten freeholders of the escheated manor had the right to graze on common pasture and to cut wood.Medieval and early modern Manchester, G.H.Tupling in Manchester and its region, pub The British Association and Manchester University Press 1962 There was no chapel of ease, unlike neighbouring St Ostwalds at Didsbury, and didn't get one until St Thomas' was built in 1758.

A further transferred in 1901,Victoria County Histories and the remainder, Heaton Moor and Heaton Chapel, was added to Stockport county borough in 1913. There was a plebiscite in the 1930 on whether the area wished to become part of Manchester again, but the vote was lost. In 1901, the population was recorded as 26,251.

The mills ran from 1892‚Äì1911 with 200,000 spindles Weaving was first recorded in 1580 and by 1776 farms were being advertised as having cowsheds and large loom houses. In spite of the industrial developments nearby in Stockport and Manchester, most of Heaton Norris remained agricultural, though in 1836 there were 20 mills employing upwards of 5,000.Heaton Norris in 1841 from Butterworth The rural nature changed with the arrival of the railway station at Heaton Norris in 1840 and Heaton Chapel in 1852, when the area became largely residential in order to house workers in local mills. The majority of Heaton Norris is characterised by deck-access or high-rise estates (such as Lancashire Hill) and Victorian terraced housing. The Nursery Inn, Green Lane Heaton Norris Rovers, now known as Stockport County Football Club, was formed in 1883, and used to play on a pitch behind the Nursery Inn on Green Lane. In 1902, they left the Green Lane ground and moved to Edgeley Park.Green Lane Conservation Area Appraisal  Geography  Heaton Norris, Heaton Mersey, Heaton Moor and Heaton Chapel are on the north bank of the River Mersey, and south of the Cringle Brook, to the west of Reddish and the River Tame. The land slopes gently towards the north from a high point in the south above a steep descent to the Mersey. Most of the townships are between 60 m and 70 m above sea level, and 30 m to 60 m above the river. Heaton Norris is about 7 km south of St Ann's Square, Manchester. The soil is clay on marl and red sandstone. The former Manchester to Buxton Roman road and the later turnpike, now the A6, pass through Heaton Norris, as does the London to Manchester railway. This is carried from Edgeley to Heaton Norris by the massive brick-built Stockport Viaduct. Along the north bank of the River Mersey ran the Great Central Railway's line from Warrington to Stockport (1852). Today this route is used by the M60 motorway; Junction 1 (formerly Junction 12 of the M63) serves Heaton Norris. The Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal terminated at Heaton Norris. M60, and Stockport Viaduct at the foot of Norris Bank. The viaduct, with Stockport centre in the background Industry In 1820, William Nelstrop established his flour mill on Lancashire Hill. Nelstrop's Albion Flour Mills were rebuilt on the same site in 1893 following a fire. The company is now one of Britain's largest independent flour millers.  Community facilities  Notable landmarks in Heaton Norris include Bryant's Warehouse, a large B&Q; superstore which was, when first opened, the largest in the country and Bowerfold Open Space, known locally as The Bonks, popular with locals for dog walking, horse riding, its football pitch, and, after heavy snowfalls, sledging. All Saints' Church, designed by Preston and Vaughan and consecrated in 1888, is on the corner of Manchester Road and All Saints Road and runs a number of community projects such as the award winning free music school for children, 'Heaton's Hotpots' free meals and various groups for children, young people and families. The church also has an active brass band and choir.  Heaton Norris in the media  In the BBC series The Mrs Merton Show and the spin-off sitcom, Mrs Merton and Malcolm, the title character, Mrs Merton, played by Greater Manchester native Caroline Aherne, often refers to living in the area. Another comedy show, Early Doors, principally written by and starring her associate Craig Cash (also a former Heaton Norris resident), revolved around a failing pub which by inference and plentiful local references was also in Heaton Norris. Some of the scenes for the BBC1 comedy drama Sunshine, starring Steve Coogan, Bernard Hill, Craig Cash and Phil Mealey, were filmed in the Nursery Inn.

The practise is documented as an extreme subculture among gay males, men who have sex with men, and to a lesser extent among women. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers, who seek sexual partners who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having unprotected sex and becoming HIV-positive; giftgivers are HIV-positive individuals who assist the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV. Previous research identified that less than 1 percent of HIV negative men were actively seeking HIV positive partners. Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers are pursuing the excitement and intimacy inherent in such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.Gregory A. Freeman, \\"In Search of Death,\\" Rolling Stone, January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print Aspects and motivations By design, bug chasing involves unprotected sex, but members of the bareback subculture who avoid condom use are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent: As many \\"bugchasers\\" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with Munchausen syndrome. Some people consider bugchasing \\"intensely erotic\\" and the act of being infected through the \\"fuck of death\\" as the \\"ultimate taboo, the most extreme sex act left.\\" Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with HIV/AIDS. Other research suggests that semen contains a wealth of meaning for those who engage in bugchasing and gift giving fantasies and practices and that ‚ÄúHIV infected semen containing the men's DNA are a way of overcoming the sense of isolation that results from ‚Äòcold, sterile‚Äô, protected sex‚Äù.Ellie Reynolds (2007) ‚ÄòPass the Cream, Hold the Butter‚Äô: Meanings of HIV Positive Semen for Bugchasers and Giftgivers, Anthropology & Medicine, 14:3, 259-266, DOI: 10.1080/13648470701694693 Others suffering from depression and suicidal ideation report fantasising or engaging in the practice as a form of suicide. Research Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999. They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew condoms and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV. Dr. Richard Tewksbury was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the Internet to assist their seroconversive efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics. Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006) research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers. # \\"The Committed Bug Chaser\\" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent anal receptive). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers. # \\"The Opportunistic Bug Chaser\\" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner's HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning anal receptive and anal insertive) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers. # \\"The Committed Gift Giver\\" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category. # \\"The Opportunistic Gift Giver\\" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner's status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample. # \\"The Serosorter\\" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their Internet profile, behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were serosorting for partners of similar HIV status. # \\"The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver\\" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample. In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers. Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely sex addicts. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk- oriented high. Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge \\"common sense\\" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens. Few respondents identified \\"getting it over with\\" as a motivating factor. Some limited identification of becoming part of the \\"community\\" or \\"brotherhood\\" was identified. Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV. In mainstream media In Episode 13 of the 2000/1 NBC series ER ER Season 7 Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asks the HIV-negative patient if he is \\"bug chasing\\". The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after Rolling Stone magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled \\"Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+\\". The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose. Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but Rolling Stone stands behind the story. Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's Fenway Community Health, was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing. He called the statements \\"entirely a fabrication,\\" but Rolling Stone also stood behind them. Steven Weinstein, then editor of the New York Blade, an established gay newspaper, called the article \\"less than truthful\\" and attributed it to a Rolling Stone editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing \\"lad mag\\" who wished to make a sensation for himself. Following the article, the Human Rights Campaign put out an action alert, calling its members to \\"PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'\\". Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations. For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the Centers for Disease Control to cut down on its AIDS funding. Writer/director Daniel Bort made a 2003 short film on the subject called Bugchaser, which premi√®red at the 16th Annual Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in New York sex clubs. In an interview with the Austin Chronicle, he explained: \\"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way.\\" At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying documentary The Gift by Louise Hogarth. On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter Marc with a C has a song on the subject entitled \\"Chasing the Bug\\". In 2004, Episode 10, Season 4 of the Showtime series Queer as Folk a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asks Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience \\"the gift\\". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident. HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 BBC programme, I love being HIV+, said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising. However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, \\"Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy.\\" The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, \\"The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality\\" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, \\"There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV.\\" See also * Bareback (sex) * Criminal transmission of HIV * HIV superinfection *Corona Party References Further reading   * * Hatfield, K.

In 1924, after the Russian Revolution, Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the Biblia Hebraica since 1937, it became internationally known as the \\"Leningrad Codex\\". Although in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city's original name was restored to St Petersburg, the National Library of Russia requested that \\"Leningrad\\" be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the Codex Petersburgensis or Petropolitanus, or the St. Petersburg Codex. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (916 CE), but contains only the later Prophets. Contents The biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian vowels and cantillation signs. In addition, there are masoretic notes in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather. The Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The carpet page shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle. The order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of Sephardic biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the Ketuvim. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below. History Leningrad Codex text sample, portions of Exodus 15:21-16:3 According to its colophon, the codex was copied in Cairo from manuscripts written by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher. It has been claimed to be a product of the Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that Asher ever saw it. Unusual for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and cantillation) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher's tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not superb, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in many hundreds of places.On the vocalization and letter-text of the Leningrad Codex see Israel Yeivin, The Aleppo Codex of the Bible: A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) pp. 357-359 (Hebrew). There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by Moshe Goshen-Gottstein that an existing text not following Asher's rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules. The codex is now preserved in the National Library of Russia, accessioned as \\"Firkovich B 19 A\\". Its former owner, the Crimean Karaite collector Abraham Firkovich, left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in St Petersburg. Modern editions =Biblia Hebraica= In 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while Paul E. Kahle supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of Biblia Hebraica (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ). As an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until Biblia Hebraica. The Westminster Leningrad Codex is an online digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the Westminster Theological Seminary. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the University of Michigan in 1981-1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan,Introductory notes to the Bibleworks WTT text, www.bibleworks.com with further proofreading and corrections. The online version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax. =Jewish editions= The Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two important modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh): *The Dotan edition, which was distributed to soldiers in mass quantities as the official Tanakh of the Israel Defense Forces throughout the 1990s. *The JPS Hebrew- English Tanakh (Philadelphia, 1999) and the various volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary and JPS Bible Commentary. For minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.

Known at first as the Richmond Colored Normal School, Armstrong was the first public school in Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, for African American students (see racial segregation). Founded in the early 1870s, the Colored Normal School was initially financed by the federal Freedmen's Bureau until it was made part of the Richmond city school system in 1876. The school's name was changed to Armstrong High School in a 1909 transition to a new building. The school's namesake is former Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, a white commander of a U.S. Colored Troops (USCT) regiment during the American Civil War. General Armstrong later founded the Hampton Institute, a historically black college now known as Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Among General Armstrong's legacies in education is the fact that he was a principal mentor of Dr. Booker T. Washington. History The location of Armstrong High school has changed three times since 1909. Once in 1923, then in 1951, and then again in 2004. It is now in its fourth location. In 1909, the school was established at Leigh Streets at first and named in honor of Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, founder of Hampton University. The school then moved to a larger facility in 1923 at the corner of Prentis and Leigh Streets (now the Adult Career Development Center), and then to a new location, 1611 North 31st Street, in 1951. In 2004, Armstrong High school merged with the nearby John F. Kennedy High School, continuing to use the Armstrong name, colors and mascot, except that it was now much newer and revamped with its air conditioned Kennedy building. At the current location, Armstrong High School is one of only two of Richmond's public schools which are physically located slightly outside the corporate limits of the independent city in the East End. The Kennedy High School complex and Fairfield Court Elementary School were built in the 1960s on land in a small portion of Henrico County adjacent to Interstate 64 which was cut off from the rest of the county when the Interstate highway was built. The school's public address announcer and former faculty member, Rodney Robinson, was named the 2019 National Teacher of the Year. Neighborhoods served The community served five public housing facilities in proximity to one another; one, Fairfield Court, is on the other side of the street from the high school. \\\\- page cited: 398. Operations Circa 2015 the school used metal detectors and had six security guards. April Hawkins, the principal, stated his belief that the school should have more guards. \\\\- page cited: 399. Demographics Circa 2015 there were 974 students, with about 97% being black. Hawkins stated that many of the black students are \\"angry\\" at the start of each school day.

It is affiliated with the Independent Christian Church of the Restoration Movement and is part of the Johnson University system. History Johnson University Florida was founded in 1975 as Central Florida Bible College. Following a move to its current main campus in 1985, the name changed to Florida Christian College. In 2013, after completing a merger with Johnson University, the school became Johnson University Florida. =2013 Acquisition by Johnson University= In its last decade operating as Florida Christian College, the campus was continually plagued with increasing financial challenges. Those challenges were greatly exacerbated by the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. On December 10, 2012, SACS leadership elected to revoke Florida Christian College's regional accreditation, effectively terminating the college's ability to function independently. Although the college appealed the committee's decision, SACS denied the appeal in February 2013. Under the administrative guidance of Johnson University, the college sought an injunction against SACS in order to restore its regional accreditation and proceed with a planned merger between the two schools. On March 8, 2013, the U.S. District Court of Northern Georgia granted the injunction restoring probationary status of FCC as a member of SACS. During this transition period, a number of significant events took place. First, the University purchased the Florida campus, simultaneously permitting financial oversight of the college and erasing its debt. Next, FCC President Bill Behrman stepped down and David L. Eubanks, former president of Johnson University, became the Chief Operating Officer. Lastly, the trustees of Johnson University voted to incorporate the Florida property into its system, and the campus officially became Johnson University Florida on July 1, 2013.  Academics  The curriculum offers courses in a variety of majors. All students are required to take a core of Bible and theology classes along with their chosen major. The college offers multiple undergraduate programs, including certificates, Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science programs, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs, and a Master of Strategic Ministry program. Johnson University Florida has been nationally accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education since 1985 and was regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) from 1995 to 2012. After losing its accreditation with SACS, it was acquired by Johnson University and is now once again regionally accredited. It is a member of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Florida Association of Colleges and Universities.

Since then its aims and activities have expanded to make it the archetypal international body in the early 21st century. Origins The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization to replace the ineffective League of Nations began under the aegis of the US State Department in 1939.Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U.N. (1997) pp 1-55 On 12 June 1941, representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as a representative of General de Gaulle of France, met in London and signed the Declaration of St. James's Palace. This was the first of six conferences that led up to the founding of the United Nations and the Charter of the United Nations. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt first suggested using the name United Nations, to refer to the Allies of World War II, to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the latter's three-week visit to the White House in December 1941. Roosevelt suggested the name as an alternative to \\"Associated Powers\\", a term the U.S. used in the First World War (the U.S. was never formally a member of the Allies of World War I but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled \\"Associated Power\\"). Churchill accepted the idea and cited Lord Byron's use of the phrase \\"United Nations\\" in the poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, which referred to the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. =1942 \\"Declaration of United Nations\\"= Poster for the founding of the United Nations The text of the \\"Declaration of United Nations\\" was drafted by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, while meeting at the White House on 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. The first official use of the term \\"United Nations\\" was on 1‚Äì2 January 1942 when 26 Governments signed the Declaration. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.David Roll, The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler (2013) pp 172-75Robert E.

Roosevelt considered his most important legacy the creation of the United Nations, making a permanent organization out of the wartime Alliance of the same name. He was the chief promoter of the United Nations idea. The first plans for the future international organization emerged in declarations signed at the wartime Allied conferences: the Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference on 30 October 1943. Roosevelt had been a strong supporter of the League of Nations back in 1919‚Äì20, but was determined to avoid the mistakes Woodrow Wilson had made. The United Nations was FDR's highest postwar priority. He insisted on full coordination with the Republican leadership. He made sure that leading Republicans were on board, especially Senators Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan,James A. Gazell, \\"Arthur H. Vandenberg, Internationalism, and the United Nations.\\" Political Science Quarterly 88#3 (1973): 375-394. online and Warren Austin of Vermont.George T. Mazuzan. Warren R. Austin at the U. N., 1946-1953 (Kent State UP, 1977). In a broad sense, Roosevelt believed that the UN could solve the minor problems and provide the chief mechanism to resolve any major Issues that arose among the great powers, all of whom had a veto. For FDR creating the UN was the most important goal for the entire war effort.For FDR, \\"establishing the United nations organization was the overarching strategic goal, the absolute first priority.\\" Roosevelt was especially interested in international protection of human right, and in this area his wife played a major role as well.Ivy P.

The Allies had agreed to the basic structure of the new body at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.Hoopes and Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U. N. (1997) pp 148-58. At Yalta, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the structure of the United Nations Security Council. Stalin insisted on having a veto and FDR finally agreed. The participants at Yalta also agreed that the United Nations would convene for the first time in San Francisco in April 1945 in the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Roosevelt considered the United Nations to be his most important legacy. He provided continuous backstage political support at home and with Churchill and Stalin abroad. The Big Four of the United States, Britain, Soviet Union and China would make the major decisions, with France added later to provide permanent members of the all-powerful Security Council. Each had a veto power, thus avoiding the fatal weakness of the League of Nations, which had theoretically been able to order its members to act in defiance of their own parliaments.John Allphin Moore Jr. and Jerry Pubantz, To Create a New World?: American Presidents & the United Nations (1999), pp 27-79. Roosevelt went public with strong advocacy in the 1944 presidential campaign, and turned detailed planning over to the State Department, where Sumner Welles and Secretary Cordell Hull worked on the project. It was his ideas that \\"four policemen\\" would collaborate to keep and enforce the peace. The United States, Britain, Soviet Union and China made the major decisions and became permanent members of the all-powerful Security Council; France was added to make five policemen.Stephen Schlesinger, \\"FDR's five policemen: creating the United Nations.\\" World Policy Journal 11.3 (1994): 88-93. online Stalin insisted on a veto power. Roosevelt finally agreed, thus avoiding the fatal weakness of the League of Nations, which theoretically could order its members to act in defiance of their own parliaments.Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U. N. (1997) From 21 September to 7 October 1944, representatives of the Republic of China, Britain, the US and the USSR met to elaborate plans at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington, D.C. Those and later talks produced proposals outlining the purposes of the United Nations organization, its membership and organs, as well as arrangements to maintain international peace and security and international economic and social cooperation. Governments and private citizens worldwide discussed and debated these proposals. Winston Churchill urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major Power after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. At the Yalta Conference it was agreed that membership would be open to nations that had joined the Allies by 1 March 1945.Robert C. Hilderbrand, Dumbarton Oaks: The Origins of the United Nations and the Search for Postwar Security (UNC Press, 2001) Brazil, Syria and a number of other countries qualified for membership by declarations of war on either Germany or Japan in the first three months of 1945 ‚Äì in some cases retroactively. Establishment Insignia of the Conference of San Francisco, prototype of the current logo of the United Nations The UN in 1945. In light blue, the founding members. In dark blue, protectorates and colonies of the founding members. On 25 April 1945, the United Nations Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco. In addition to Governments, a number of non-government organizations, including Rotary International and Lions Clubs International received invitations to assist in the drafting of a charter. After working for two months, the fifty nations represented at the conference signed the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June. Poland, which was unable to send a representative to the conference due to political instability, signed the charter on 15 October 1945. The charter stated that before it would come into effect, it must be ratified by the Governments of the Republic of China, France, the USSR, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. This occurred on 24 October 1945, and the United Nations was officially formed.https://www.un.org/aboutun/sanfrancisco/history.html The 60th Anniversary of the San Francisco Conference The date each founding member state deposited their ratification of the UN Charter is as follows: * USA ‚Äì 8 Aug 1945 * France ‚Äì 31 Aug 1945 * Dominican Rep. ‚Äì 4 Sep 1945 * Nicaragua ‚Äì 6 Sep 1945 * New Zealand ‚Äì 19 Sep 1945 * Brazil ‚Äì 21 Sep 1945 * Argentina ‚Äì 24 Sep 1945 * El Salvador ‚Äì 26 Sep 1945 * Haiti ‚Äì 27 Sep 1945 * China ‚Äì 28 Sep 1945 * Turkey ‚Äì 28 Sep 1945 * Denmark ‚Äì 9 October 1945 * Chile ‚Äì 11 Oct 1945 * Philippines ‚Äì 11 Oct 1945 * Paraguay ‚Äì 12 Oct 1945 * Cuba ‚Äì 15 Oct 1945 * Lebanon ‚Äì 15 Oct 1945 * Iran ‚Äì 16 Oct 1945 * Luxembourg ‚Äì 17 Oct 1945 * Saudi Arabia ‚Äì 18 Oct 1945 * Czechoslovakia ‚Äì 19 Oct 1945 * Syria ‚Äì 19 Oct 1945 * Yugoslavia ‚Äì 19 Oct 1945 * UK ‚Äì 20 Oct 1945 * Egypt ‚Äì 22 Oct 1945 * Byelorussia ‚Äì 24 Oct 1945 * Poland ‚Äì 24 Oct 1945 * Ukraine ‚Äì 24 Oct 1945 * USSR ‚Äì 24 Oct 1945 (note - the United Nations was established on this date) * Greece ‚Äì 25 Oct 1945 * India ‚Äì 30 Oct 1945 * Peru ‚Äì 31 Oct 1945 * Australia ‚Äì 1 Nov 1945 * Costa Rica ‚Äì 2 Nov 1945 * Liberia ‚Äì 2 Nov 1945 * Colombia ‚Äì 5 Nov 1945 * Mexico ‚Äì 7 Nov 1945 * South Africa ‚Äì 7 Nov 1945 * Canada ‚Äì 9 Nov 1945 * Ethiopia ‚Äì 13 Nov 1945 * Panama ‚Äì 13 Nov 1945 * Bolivia ‚Äì 14 Nov 1945 * Venezuela ‚Äì 15 Nov 1945 * Honduras ‚Äì 17 Nov 1945 * Guatemala ‚Äì 21 Nov 1945 * Norway ‚Äì 27 Nov 1945 * Netherlands ‚Äì 10 Dec 1945 * Uruguay ‚Äì 18 Dec 1945 * Ecuador ‚Äì 21 Dec 1945 * Iraq ‚Äì 21 Dec 1945 * Belgium ‚Äì 27 Dec 1945 Plaques unveiled in 1996 to commemorate the first meeting of the General Assembly The first meeting of the General Assembly was held in Westminster Central Hall, London, on 10 January 1946. The Security Council met for the first time a week later in Church House, Westminster. The League of Nations formally dissolved itself on 18 April 1946 and transferred its mission to the United Nations. Activities The United Nations has achieved considerable prominence in the social arena, fostering human rights, economic development, decolonization, health and education, for example, and interesting itself in refugees and trade. The leaders of the UN had high hopes that it would act to prevent conflicts between nations and make future wars impossible. Those hopes have obviously not fully come to pass. From about 1947 until 1991 the division of the world into hostile camps during the Cold War made agreement on peacekeeping matters extremely difficult. Following the end of the Cold War, renewed calls arose for the UN to become the agency for achieving world peace and co-operation, as several dozen active military conflicts continued to rage across the globe. The breakup of the Soviet Union has also left the United States in a unique position of global dominance, creating a variety of new problems for the UN (See the United States and the United Nations). Facilities UN headquarters in New York City UN building in Vienna In June 1945, delegates from around the world gathered in San Francisco to draft the charter for the United Nations. Potential sites for the UN Headquarters included Vienna, Switzerland, Berlin, Quebec, and the Netherlands before the delegation decided on a headquarters in the United States by December 1945. Many U.S. cities vied for the honor of hosting the UN Headquarters site, such as Marin County, California, St. Louis, Boston, Chicago, Fairfield County, CT, Westchester County, NY, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, Tuskahoma, Oklahoma, the Black Hills of South Dakota, Belle Isle in Detroit, and a site on Navy Island straddling the U.S.-Canada border were considered as potential sites for the UN Headquarters. San Francisco, where the UN Headquarters delegation was held, was favored by Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Philippines due to the city's proximity to their countries. The UN and many of its delegates seriously considered Philadelphia for the headquarters; the city offered to donate land in several select sites, including Fairmount Park, Andorra, and a Center City, Philadelphia location which would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from Independence Hall to Penn's Landing. In 1946, John D. Rockefeller III and Laurance Rockefeller each offered their respective residences in Kykuit in Mount Pleasant, New York as headquarters for the UN, but the proposals were vetoed as the sites were too isolated from Manhattan. The Soviet Union vetoed Boston due to the denunciations of Soviet expansion by John E. Swift, a Massachusetts judge and Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus. Prior to the completion of the UN's current headquarters, it used part of a Sperry Gyroscope Company factory in Lake Success, New York for most of its operations, including the Security Council, between 1946 and 1952. Between 1946 and 1950, the General Assembly, however, met at the New York City Building in Flushing Meadows, which had been built for the 1939 New York World's Fair and is now the site of the Queens Museum. New York City Planning Commissioner Robert Moses convinced Nelson Rockefeller to purchase a piece of land along the East River in New York City from real estate developer William Zeckendorf Sr.; The purchase was funded by Nelson's father, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The Rockefeller family owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue from the Zeckendorf site. The UN ultimately chose the New York City site over Philadelphia after Rockefeller offered to donate the land along the East River. The UN headquarters officially opened on January 9, 1951, although construction was not formally completed until October 9, 1952. Structure and associated organizations The basic constitutional makeup of the United Nations has changed little, though vastly increased membership has altered the functioning of some elements. The UN as a whole has generated a rich assortment of non-governmental organizations and special bodies over the years: some with a regional focus, some specific to the various peacekeeping missions, and others of global scope and importance. Other bodies (such as the International Labour Organization) formed prior to the establishment of the United Nations and only subsequently became associated with it.

However, there is little clarity or consensus about what reform might mean in practice. Both those who want the UN to play a greater role in world affairs and those who want its role confined to humanitarian work or otherwise reduced use the term \\"UN reform\\" to refer to their ideas.Muravchik, Joshua (2005) The Future of the United Nations: Understanding the Past to Chart a Way Forward AEI Press . The range of opinion extends from those who want to eliminate the UN entirely, to those who want to make it into a full- fledged world government. Secretary Generals have presented numerous ways to implement these new reforms. There have been reform efforts since the creation of the UN and closely associated with each of the Secretary-Generals. On 1 June 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Atul Khare of India to spearhead efforts to implement a reform agenda aimed at streamlining and improving the efficiency of the world body. Khare will lead the Change Management Team (CMT) at the UN, working with both departments and offices within the Secretariat and with other bodies in the UN system and the 193 member states. The CMT is tasked with guiding the implementation of a reform agenda at the UN that starts with the devising of a wide-ranging plan to streamline activities, increase accountability and ensure the organization is more effective and efficient in delivering its many mandates and protocols. History The United Nations has undergone phases of reform since its foundation in 1945. During the first years, the first decisive change was the development of peacekeeping measures to oversee the implementation of ceasefire agreements in 1949 in the Middle East and one year later in the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. The Soviet Union launched reform initiatives during the East-West antagonism in the 1950s to curtail the independence of the Secretariat by replacing the post of Secretary-General with a troika, including a representative from the socialist states. Decolonization created rapid growth in UN membership, and by 1965 it stood at 118, twice as much as at the Organization's founding. With states from Africa and Asia joining the United Nations, development issues became increasingly important, resulting in the expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on an International Economic Order (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by financial crisis and the retreat of the United States, which triggered a reform of the budgetary process and the downsizing of the Organization. With the end of the Cold War, the rediscovery of and renaissance of the United Nations were hailed; the first half of the 1990s saw a major expansion of the Organization and the reform associated with the Agenda for Peace launched by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. A string of new peacekeeping missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered interest in the reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international 'responsibility to protect' populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights. As of 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon continued the reform agenda covering oversight, integrity, and ethics which had previously been launched in response to investigation of the UN Oil- for-Food Programme. The Programme responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilians and was the largest, most complex and most ambitious relief effort in the history of the United Nations. With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international environmental governance, a unified gender organization, and 'Delivering as One' at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities. Reforms =Security Council reform= A very frequently discussed change to the UN structure is to change the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945. There are several proposed plans, notably by the G4 nations, by the Uniting for Consensus group, and by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. =UN Secretariat Transparency reform= At another level, calls for reforming the UN demand to make the UN administration (usually called the UN Secretariat or \\"the bureaucracy\\") more transparent, more accountable, and more efficient, including direct election of the Secretary-General by the people as in a presidential system. UN Secretariat/administration reforms seldom gets much attention in the media, though within the Organization they are seen as widely contentious issues. They run the bureaucracy of the UN, responding to the decisions by the Member States in the Security Council and the General Assembly. Mark Malloch Brown, the former secretary general of the United Nations Development Program attributes the inefficiency of the UN administration to the \\"disconnect between the merit and reward\\" and further advocatesFasulo, p.166. reconnecting merit to make the UN again an international meritocracy. \\"reconnecting merit to make the UN again an international meritocracy\\" to overcome the problem. He believes that the UN must stop promoting on the basis of political correctness that encourages promoting staffs proportionately from certain regions of the world, but instead make more use of Asia, Africa and other so-called less developed regions that now offer a large pool of talented, skilled, and highly motivated professionals. He argues that these individuals who are highly qualified will readily move up through the UN system without need of the \\"cultural relativism which is used to promote incompetents.\\" A somewhat related point is often made by UN member states from the developing world, who complain that some of the most desirable senior posts within the Secretariat are filled under a \\"tradition\\" of regional representation that favors the United States and other affluent nations. The point has been made forcefully by Ambassador Munir Akram of Pakistan, who was recently head of the G-77. \\"The major countries, the major powers hold very high positions in the Secretariat and support their national interests and refuse to allow the Secretary General to cut departments,\\" he claims. And when they do ask for budget cuts, they do it \\"where it does not affect their national interests.\\" He labels this \\"a double standard which is applied or is thought to be applied in the Secretariat, and we as overseers of the G-77 do not accept this double standard.\\" Among the notable efforts of Secretariat reform since 2005 is the Secretary-General's report Investing in the United Nations from March 2006 and the Comprehensive review of governance and oversight within the UN, June the same year. From the Member States side there is the Four Nations Initiative, a cooperation project by Chile, South Africa, Sweden and Thailand to promote governance and management reforms, aiming at increased accountability and transparency. =Democracy reform= Another frequent demand is that the UN become \\"more democratic\\", and a key institution of a world democracy. This raises fundamental questions about the nature and role of the UN. The UN is not a world government, rather a forum for the world's sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action. A direct democracy would request the presidential election of the UN Secretary-General by direct vote of the citizens of the democratic countries (world presidentialism) as well as the General Assembly (just as cities, states and nations have their own representatives in many systems, who attend specifically to issues relevant to the given level of authority) and the International Court of Justice. Others have proposed a combination of direct and indirect democracy, whereby national governments might ratify the expressed will of the people for such important posts as an empowered World Court. =Calls for diversity and democracy= Implementation of population-based UN voting also raises the problems of diversity of interests and governments of the various nations. The nations in the UN contain representative democracies as well as absolute dictatorships and many other types of government. Allowing large powers to vote their population's interests en bloc raises the question of whether they would really represent the interests and desires of their individual citizens and the world community. Anything like direct election would be impossible as well in the many nations where an accurate direct vote would be impossible or where the local government has power to influence the local voters as well as security of the ballot box. Giving the UN any kind of actual governance power raises the question of how these powers could be carried out. What would happen when a vote of the UN General Assembly demands changes in the borders or political status of a nation, or requires citizens in some nations to tax themselves in favor of other nations, or demands the arrest of the leader of a nation, and is met by refusal? The subsidiarity principle resolves some of these issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It can be compared to federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy. =Financing reform= On the subject of financing, Paul Hawken made the following proposal in his book The Ecology of Commerce:The Ecology of Commerce. Harper Collins, 1993. > \\"A tax on missiles, planes, tanks, and guns would provide the UN with its > entire budget, as well as pay for all peacekeeping efforts around the world, > including the resettlement of refugees and reparations to the victims of > war.\\" The main problem with implementing such a radical tax would be finding acceptance. Although such a system might find acceptance within some nations, particularly those (1) with a history of neutrality, (2) without an active military (such as Costa Rica), or (3) with lower levels of military spending (such as Japan, which currently spends 1% of its GDP on defense), it would be unpopular among many consumers of arms. Nations in this latter category range from the United States, which spends 4% of its GDP on defense, to dictatorships who depend on arms to keep themselves in power. Other likely opponents would be nations engaged in ongoing military conflicts, or others in a state of heightened military alert, such as Israel. Arms producers would also oppose it, because it would increase their costs and possibly reduce their consumer base. Another tax that the UN might promote would be some sort of global resources dividend. =Human rights reform= The United Nations Commission on Human Rights came under fire during its existence for the high- profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee the human rights of their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body. On Wednesday, 15 March 2006, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing a new United Nations Human Rights Council, the successor to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with the resolution receiving approval from 170 members of the 191-nation Assembly. Only the United States, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Israel voted against the Council's creation, claiming that it would have too little power and that there were insufficient safeguards to prevent human rights-abusing nations from taking control.. The UNHRC has itself been criticised for the repressive states among its membership. The UNHRC has also been accused of anti-Israel bias, a particular criticism being its focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at each session as Agenda Item 7.Resolution A/HRC/RES/5/1 ‚Äì Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council, 7 August 2007 Creation, Removals and Additions for proposed UN Reform =Creation of United Nations Parliamentary Assembly= A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, or United Nations People's Assembly (UNPA), is a proposed addition to the United Nations System that eventually would allow for direct election of UN Parliament members by citizens of all over the world. Proposals for a UNPA date back to the UN's formation in 1945, but largely stagnated until the 1990s. They have recently gained traction amidst increasing globalization, as national parliamentarians and citizens groups seek to counter the growing influence of unelected international bureaucracies. =Creation of United Nations Environment Organization= Following the publication of Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC in February 2007, a \\"Paris Call for Action\\" read out by French President Jacques Chirac and supported by 46 countries, called for the United Nations Environment Programme to be replaced by a new and more powerful United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO), to be modelled on the World Health Organization. The 46 countries included the European Union member states, but notably did not include the United States, China, Russia, and India, the top four emitters of greenhouse gases. =Placing all UN Development Agencies and Specialized Programmes under a UNDG= Then Secretary General Kofi Annan streamlined all UN Agencies working on International Development Issues under a new United Nations Development Group, chaired by the Administrator of the UNDP.Remarks By U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at United Nations General Assembly Session, United Nations Headquarters, Federal News Service, 22 September 1997 The Delivering as One concept was also introduced. The main normative instrument for reforming the UN development system is the Quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR). Following an assessment of progress, this General Assembly resolution which designs and gives mandates to the UN system to better address reform objectives is negotiated every four years. The most recent QCPR was adopted in December 2012. =Removal of spent provisions in UN Charter= Several provisions of the United Nations Charter are no longer relevant. In Larger Freedom proposed the removal of these provisions: *Since there are no longer any trust territories, the Trusteeship Council no longer serves any purpose, and has not met since 1994. Thus, Chapter XIII of the Charter is no longer relevant, and can be deleted. *Due to Cold War disagreements, the Military Staff Committee never succeeded in its intended purpose. Although it formally still meets every two weeks, it has been effectively inactive since 1948. Thus, article 47, and the references to it in articles 26, 45 and 46 can be deleted. *The \\"enemy clauses\\" in articles 53 and 107 contain special provisions relating to the members of the Axis in World War II (Germany, Japan, etc.) Some nations consider these to be no longer relevant; Japan in particular would like to see them removed. There are also other provisions of the UN Charter that deal with transitional arrangements, and thus are now spent. For example, article 61(3) and article 109(3). However, In Larger Freedom does not contain any proposals with respect to these provisions. Due to the difficulty in amending the Charter, it is unlikely that any of these spent provisions will be amended except as part of a package making substantive amendments, such as Security Council reform. Further, while In Larger Freedom proposes that certain provisions be removed there is not universal agreement. One school of thought in particular suggests that the Military Staff Committee could be revitalized by member states finally meeting their Article 45 commitments to provide a force able to perform peacemaking and peace enforcement under the legitimacy of the United Nations flag.

She was the wife of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. She was also the elder sister of Anne Neville, who was Princess of Wales by her first marriage and Queen consort of England by her second. Life Isabel Neville was born at Warwick Castle, the seat of the Earls of Warwick. In 1469, her ambitious father betrothed her to England's heir presumptive, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, the brother of both King Edward IV and Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III). The king opposed the marriage as it would bring the already powerful Earl of Warwick too close to the throne. However the ceremony took place in secret at Calais on 11 July 1469, conducted by Isabel Neville's uncle George Neville, archbishop of York. Following their marriage Clarence joined forces with Warwick and allied with the Lancastrians led by Margaret of Anjou, queen consort to Henry VI. After Isabel Neville's sister Anne was married to Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the son and heir of Henry VI, Clarence rejoined his brother, realizing that it was now unlikely that he would become king. Marriage and children Isabel's two survivng children with her sister, nephew and brother in law Isabel Neville married George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, in Calais, France, on 11 July 1469.

Death The Duke and Duchess of Clarence, Cardiff Castle. Isabel Neville died on 22 December 1476, two and a half months after the birth of Richard. It is now thought the cause was either consumption or childbed fever, yet at the time her husband accused one of her ladies-in-waiting of having murdered her, and committed in his turn a notorious judicial murder of the lady, called Ankarette Twynyho. Ankarette's grandson Roger Twynyho received from Edward IV a full retrospective pardon for Ankarette, and the petition he submitted to the king in 1478 describes fully the circumstances of the case, well illustrating the quasi-kingly high- handedness of Clarence, which was ultimately not tolerated by the king:Exemplification, at the request of Roger Twynyho of Westminster, kinsman and heir of Ankarette late the wife of William Twynyho of Cayforde, co.

James A. Harding and David Lipscomb founded the Nashville Bible School, now known as Lipscomb University in honor of the latter. Personal life Lipscomb was born to Granville Lipscomb (born January 13, 1802, in Louisa County, Virginia, died November 16, 1853) and his second wife Ann E. Lipscomb (born January 25, 1799, in Louisa County, Virginia, died January 29, 1835, in Illinois) (called \\"Nancy\\" in some sources). Granville had previously been married, on December 14, 1825, in Spotsylvania, Virginia, to the former Ellen Guerner. Granville and his older brother William Lipscomb were active in the Bean's Creek Baptist Church, where they were listed as the church clerks for 1828-1831 (Granville Lipscomb) and 1844-1876 (William C. Lipscomb). Attempts to convert the Bean's Creek church to Restoration Movement theology were poorly received, and Granville Lipscomb's family was expelled in 1831.Therestorationmovement.com, Early Life Of David LipscombTherestorationmovement.com, David Lipscomb at therestorationmovement.com David Lipscomb was born in Huntland, Tennessee. The Lipscomb family, originally Baptist, were said to have converted to Restoration Movement Christianity in the mid-1820s while reading Alexander Campbell's periodical Christian Baptist, copies of which had been sent to the Lipscomb's family by Ann's sister Elizabeth (born ca. 1797) and brother-in- law, physician Lunsford Lindsay (born ca. 1793) of Todd County, Kentucky, who would later participate in the formation of the Cadiz Christian Church in 1837.WesternKentuckyHistory.org: Trigg County Chapter 6 The Lipscombs were said to be charter members of the Old Salem church, according to Earl Irvin West's Lipscomb biography, The Life and Times of David Lipscomb. :The Old Salem congregation began in May 1834 with two male members and two females. Also, five colored people belonged. By Christmas that year the number had grown to thirty-four whites and twelve blacks. The Lipscomb family moved to Illinois in 1834 for the purpose of freeing their slaves. David's mother Ann, along with three of his siblings, died of a fever in 1835 while they were still in Illinois. David's later belief that racial divisions in the church are inconsistent with Christianity were shaped by this experience. Lipscomb's father moved the rest of the family back to Tennessee in 1835 or 1836 and he married his third wife, Jane L. Breedan (died September 8, 1885), on April 11 or August 11, 1837.MS 2473: The Bean's Creek Baptist Church Minute Book, 1814-1876 at the library of the University of Tennessee (Knoxville) David's half-brother, also named Granville, was born to Jane Breedan Lipscomb. William Lipscomb would help to found Neely's Bend Church of Christ in April 1872 .History of Neelys Bend Church of Christ Granville Lipscomb Jr. would become a leader in the Lebanon Church of Christ founded in 1879 in Weakley County, Tennessee.rootsweb.com: Lebanon Church of Christ Lipscomb was married to Margaret Zellner on July 22, 1862. Only one child was born to them. Little Zellner died at the age of 9 months of dehydration while teething. They reared, however, several foster children. David Lipscomb died on November 11, 1917, at the age of 86 years. Funeral services were held in the College Street Church, where he had been an elder for many years.Biographical Sketch On The Life Of David Lipscomb Tolbert Fanning and Franklin College David Lipscomb (1831‚Äì1917) Lipscomb, along with his older brother William, was greatly influenced by Nashville, Tennessee, church leader Tolbert Fanning. Lipscomb was baptized by Fanning in 1845. He entered Fanning's Franklin College in 1846, graduating in 1849.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Lipscomb, DavidReid, D. G., Linder, R. D., Shelley, B. L., & Stout, H. S. (1990). Dictionary of Christianity in America. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press. Entry on Lipscomb, David While a student at Franklin, Lipscomb roomed with the father of Edward Ward Carmack. Fanning was an enforcer of strict orthodoxy with regard to Restoration doctrines, seeing anything not specifically authorized by the New Testament as unnecessary and hence sinful addition to the \\"primitive\\" Christianity of the 1st century, which the movement was by definition dedicated to restoring. Gospel Advocate In this spirit, in 1855, Fanning and William Lipscomb began publishing a magazine aimed at dissemination of this view throughout the Restoration Movement, the Gospel Advocate. Following the resumption of mail service, which had been interrupted by the American Civil War, David Lipscomb revived the Gospel Advocate in July 1866, with himself and Fanning as editors: Fanning withdrew making Lipscomb the sole editor until he was joined by P. S. Fall, John T. Walsh, Jacob Creath Jr., T. W. Brents, and Carroll Kendrick in 1867. Although the Advocate has always been conservative and Bible based, the \\"tone and direction\\" has varied as editors have changed. When David Lipscomb was the editor, the focus was on seeking unity by following scripture exactly, and the Advocate's editorial position was to reject anything that is not explicitly allowed by scripture. When Foy E. Wallace was editor the Advocate fought against dispensational premillennialism. Editor B. C. Goodpasture used the Advocate to oppose the \\"non-institutional\\" view within the Churches of Christ. Despite these differences in editorial focus, throughout its entire history the Advocate has consistently sought to promote Christianity based on New Testament precedents. Views on war and government Lipscomb was deeply affected by the American Civil War, which prompted him to reevaluate his beliefs concerning the relationship between Christians and government. He shifted from being a strong supporter of American democracy to a more \\"Mennonite-like\\" view, no longer believing that Christians should participate in war or actively participate in government. The distinction between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world became central to his thinking. Lipscomb expressed these views during the war in the Gospel Advocate and after the war in a book titled Civil Government. Because he actively opposed the participation of Christians in war, he was often viewed as a traitor to the Confederate States of America and later to the United States. Lipscomb did believe the war had served a positive purpose by freeing the slaves, although he challenged the American Christian Missionary Society's support of the war. The radical libertarian scholar Edward Stringham has argued that Lipscomb had independently questioned common assumptions such as these: # Governments need to make laws. # Governments are created for the public good. # Democracy is for the common good. Stringham further describes Lipscomb as arguing as follows: # Governments may seek to increase disorder to expand their power. # People should abstain from voting, instead seeking change through persuasive and non-coercive methods. # Peaceful civilization is not dependent on the state. # Governments are created for the benefit of the rulers, not the people. Nashville Bible School Lipscomb for a time was a prosperous farmer in addition to his religious activities, at one time operating his own ferry across the Cumberland River from his farm north of Nashville to the side of the river on which the main part of the city was located. He eventually relocated to an estate south of Nashville. Today, this estate is the campus of Lipscomb University. The log house in which he lived on his former farm has been dismantled and re-erected adjacent to his later home, which is used by the university for some social occasions. In 1891, Lipscomb and James A. Harding founded the Nashville Bible School, the precursor to the current Lipscomb University, which was not named for him until after his death. As Lipscomb was a product of the predominant Southern culture of the time, this institution was segregated and was for many years solely for white students, necessitating a separate sister institution in North Nashville for blacks, which was not totally dismantled and merged with the larger white school until the 1960s. Opposition to missionary societies and instrumental music Lipscomb, along with his mentor Tolbert Fanning, opposed the newly formed American Christian Missionary Society. No disagreement existed over the need for evangelism, but many believed that missionary societies were not authorized by scripture and would compromise the autonomy of local congregations.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Missionary Societies, Controversy Over, pp. 534-537 The use of musical instruments in worship had been discussed in journal articles as early as 1849, and initial reactions were generally unfavorable.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Instrumental Music However, some congregations are known to have been using musical instruments in the 1850s and 1860s. Both acceptance of instruments and discussion of the issue grew after the American Civil War. Opponents argued that the New Testament provided no authorization for their use in worship, whereas supporters argued on the basis of expediency and Christian liberty. Affluent, urban congregations were more likely to adopt musical instruments, while poorer and more rural congregations tended to see them as \\"an accommodation to the ways of the world.\\" Although Lipscomb was slow to come to a decision on the issue, articulating his final position in 1878, he came firmly to oppose the use of musical instruments in worship. One biographer describes Lipscomb as taking \\"a firm stand against the organization of human societies for the preaching of the gospel, and he as ably contended for the simple worship without the use of instrumental music, as taught in the New Testament.\\"H. Leo Boles, Biographical Sketches Of Gospel Preachers (Gospel Advocate Company: Nashville, TN 1932)p243-247 A deeper theological concern for Lipscomb was the adoption of German liberal theology by many among the Disciples wing of the Restoration Movement. He perceived them as taking a direction very incompatible with the principles enunciated by Thomas and Alexander Campbell. As the 19th century progressed, a division gradually developed between those whose primary commitment was to unity, and those whose primary commitment was to the restoration of the primitive church.Richard Thomas Hughes and R. L. Roberts, The Churches of Christ, 2nd Edition, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, , , 345 pages Those whose primary focus was unity gradually took on \\"an explicitly ecumenical agenda\\" and \\"sloughed off the restorationist vision.\\" This group increasingly used the terms \\"Disciples of Christ\\" and \\"Christian Churches\\" rather than \\"Churches of Christ.\\" At the same time, those whose primary focus was restoration of the primitive church increasingly used the term \\"Churches of Christ\\" rather than \\"Disciples of Christ.\\" Lipscomb served as a moderate among those with conservative views, to the extent that Austin McGary described him as liberal, and he was more inclusive than either McGary or Daniel Sommer. But in 1906 Lipscomb answered the director of the U.S. religious census for the conservatives when they were asked if the Disciples of Christ were divided, to the effect that they were. In the religious census of 1906 some confusion pervaded the data as some who supported the missionary societies and instrumental music reported themselves as in the Churches of Christ and some who opposed the innovations still considered themselves Disciples of Christ. Churches of Christ Thus in 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed the Christian Churches and the Churches of Christ as separate and distinct groups for the first time.McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) - St. Louis, Chalice Press, This, however, was simply the recognition of a division that had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883. The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the rejection of musical instruments in the Churches of Christ. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860 with the introduction of organs in some churches. More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered. After the division Disciples churches used \\"Christian Church\\" as the dominant designation for congregations. The approach to missionary work and the presence or absence of mechanical instruments were the most visible issues, but some deeper, underlying ones were inextricable from those issues. The process that led to the separation had begun prior to the American Civil War. In sum, for a movement based on Christian unity based on the Bible, one side went in the direction of unity and the other side went in the direction of Restorationism. Legacy According to The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement, Lipscomb's \\"greatest contributions came through the Nashville Bible School, the Gospel Advocate, and his other writings.\\" The Nashville Bible School is now Lipscomb University. The Gospel Advocate has long been very influential in the Churches of Christ and was, during much of the twentieth century, the most influential journal within the brotherhood, helping to shape consensus views.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Churches of Christ As the Churches of Christ have no denominational hierarchy, through much of its history the views of the brotherhood have been heavily influenced by its journals and their editors (although an argument can be made that since the 1980s lectureship speakers and university leaders have tended to have more influence than editors).

A number of organizations, including police and fire departments, emergency medical services, motorcycle couriers, taxicab providers, trucking companies, railroads, and public utility companies, use dispatchers to relay information, direct personnel, and coordinate their operations.  Types of dispatchers  =Emergency dispatchers= A dispatcher in Germany at work with an accident involving a tram An emergency dispatcher, also known as public safety dispatcher or 9-1-1 dispatcher, receives calls from individuals who require emergency services, including police services, firefighting, and emergency medical services. Once information is obtained from the caller, the dispatcher activates the appropriate services necessary to respond to the nature of the call for help. The dispatcher also obtains and relays pertinent information to the field units to help ensure the adequacy and safety of the response. Emergency dispatchers may also use preapproved protocols to talk a caller or bystander through lifesaving medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, childbirth, and first aid. They may also require special certification. In the United States, about 10% of all dispatchers employed in 2004 were public safety dispatchers.www.bls.gov Occupational Outlook Handbook 2006-07 Edition. URL accessed on April 6, 2006 =Transportation and service dispatchers= A number of other organizations use dispatchers to respond to service calls, coordinate transportation schedules, and to organize the delivery of materials: *A truck dispatcher is employed by a trucking company to monitor the delivery of freight over long distances and coordinate delivery pickup and drop-off schedules. *A bus dispatcher monitors the schedules of their bus fleet and address any problems that arise during their operations. *A tow-truck dispatcher responds to calls for emergency roadside assistance. *A gas and water service dispatcher monitors their respective utilities and receive calls for emergency assistance that involve gas lines and water mains. In the United States, about 26% of all dispatchers employed in 2004 worked for transportation and warehousing industries. =Railroad dispatchers= A train dispatcher is employed by a railroad to direct and facilitate the movement of trains over an assigned territory, which is usually part, or all, of a railroad operating division. The dispatcher is also responsible for cost effective movement of trains and other on-track railroad equipment to optimize physical (trains) and human resource (crews) assets. A crew dispatcher keeping track of train crew assignments in Penn Central A crew dispatcher is also employed by the railroad to keep track of train crews and their assignments. The crew dispatcher is responsible for assigning train crew to trains based upon scheduled rosters, and also making real-time adjustments as necessary based on rail traffic conditions and delays. The crew dispatcher is normally assisted by a crew caller whose responsibility is to telephone the train and engine crews to advise them of time to report for duty. The crew dispatcher is also responsible for checking that each train and engine crew are properly qualified for their assignments and have had proper rest according to labour regulations. =Airline or flight dispatchers= A flight dispatcher assists in planning flight paths, taking into account wind speed, storms, aircraft performance and loading, and other conditions. Some dispatchers provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions or paths change. They usually work in the operations or control center of the airline. Working conditions and environment Dispatchers are responsible for monitoring all of the communications within a specific geographic area. Public safety dispatchers are responsible for all emergency communications that occur within the jurisdiction of their department. These workers receive and document incoming calls, transmit messages to appropriate personnel, and keep logs of the daily activities of their personnel. Public safety dispatchers usually work in a police station, a fire station, or a hospital. Other dispatchers work in centralized communication centers associated with their specific company or service. Dispatchers of all kinds work with multiple communications systems depending on their function. These systems can include but not limited to telephones, radios, computers and computer-aided dispatch programs, video surveillance cameras, and ground-to-aircraft messaging systems such as ACARS. As a result of sitting for long periods and using such equipment, dispatchers can develop eye strain and back problems. Many dispatchers must also work irregular hours to provide 24-hour service, which includes night, weekend, and holiday hours. Public safety dispatchers are usually the first point of contact between emergency services and the public. When receiving incoming calls for help, these dispatchers must ascertain the nature, location, and extent of the emergency. Callers requesting emergency assistance are often in a state of heightened emotional distress, which can make it difficult to obtain the information needed to handle the call appropriately. The working conditions of a public safety dispatcher may be particularly stressful compared to others because handling a call incorrectly may delay or misdirect emergency personnel, which could result in serious injury or even death. Human error can also produce deadly results for other types of dispatchers. A train dispatcher in Spain was found guilty of negligent homicide for a head-on train collision that occurred in June 2003. Nineteen people died and forty-eight were injured in a crash where the dispatcher allowed a passenger train to leave a station when a freight train was approaching the station on the same line. Training and employment Employment as a dispatcher does not usually require a level of education higher than a high school diploma, but many that work in the field hold liberal arts degrees. Employers prefer candidates with computer and clerical skills, communication skills, and the ability to work fast under pressure. Candidates for employment as public safety dispatchers may be required to pass written, oral, or performance tests and are governed by state or local regulations. Public safety dispatchers may also have to obtain certifications and attend additional training before or after they are employed by state or local governments to dispatch for police, fire, or emergency medical services. The level of training required for these dispatchers is typically the most extensive in comparison to other dispatch positions. A standard certification requirement for public safety dispatchers is Terminal Operator certification for access to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database system. Access to this database system often allows additional access to the state- level system comparable to NCIC which allows public safety dispatchers to access motor vehicle registration and drivers license information as well as wants or warrants by various law enforcement agencies both statewide and national. In addition to certifications, specialized training is also required or appropriated to public safety dispatchers. As public safety dispatchers are the first contact made between the public and emergency services, public safety dispatchers need to be able to extract a vast array of information out of the caller. Such specialized training for 911 dispatchers can include: suicide intervention, hostage negotiation, bomb threats, tactical dispatching (for SWAT teams), domestic violence and domestic and foreign terrorism countermeasures. Many are also trained as Emergency Medical Dispatchers, able to give first aid instructions to victims or families prior to EMS arrival. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 266,000 people were employed as dispatchers in 2004. Employment for dispatcher is projected to grow as fast as the average (an increase of 9 to 17 percent) through the year 2014. In addition, it is expected that a number of current dispatchers will either transfer to other occupations or leave the labor force, which will result in an increase of openings. Hardware The primary tool of the dispatcher is the dispatch console. A dispatch console is a system that interfaces to a private or public radio system, allowing the dispatcher to communicate directly with all field workers, police officers, EMS personnel, and others in order to coordinate their activities. Dispatchers use various hardware and software to create dispatch.

He gained recognition in Bollywood with Yash Chopra's drama Mashaal (1984) as a Tapori, for which he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His Tapori persona and stubble look was considered unconventional at the time, but would become fashionable in India many years later. Kapoor's 1985 releases included Yudh and Saaheb. Yudh featured him uttering his iconic line \\"Ek Dum Jhakaas\\". But it was Meri Jung (1985), wherein he played the role of an angry young lawyer fighting for justice that gave him his first Filmfare best actor nomination. So all of Anil's films in 1985 were noticed and liked and he had truly arrived in the industry. Anil Kapoor played a comic Tapori again in Karma (1986), the biggest hit of the year. Also in 1986, Kapoor played the role of a carefree playboy in the hit Janbaaz, co-starring Feroz Khan. Kapoor's other release of 1986 Insaaf Ki Awaaz with Rekha was a box office hit.

The following year he delivered Ram Lakhan (which became the second highest box office earner of 1989) with the song One Two Ka Four. In the film Parinda, Kapoor played his role with conviction and his biggest achievement was displaying the vulnerability of his character so perfectly.

Ibosnetwork.com Kapoor excelled in his portrayal of an autistic person in the 1989 film, Eeshwar and this film proved his versatility as an actor. =1990s= The year 1990 saw him play a dual role, as twin brothers in the highly successful Kishen Kanhaiya and in the same year he further attained reasonable box-office success with Ghar Ho To Aisa. Kapoor came up with a critically acclaimed performance in Awaargi. Many critics called that his best performance ever but the film flopped at the BO. Also films like Jamai Raja and Jeevan Ek Sanghursh both South remakes were major flops. This was a setback in his career as 1990- was supposed to be the year in which Anil would have been crowned Number one in Bollywood. But with these flops Anil was on the bad foot. This was followed by a restrained yet striking performance as a middle-aged man in Yash Chopra's romantic drama Lamhe, opposite actress Sridevi which won her the Filmfare Best Actress Award a landmark film of Indian cinema and Yash Chopra's best work to date. It was the first film in which he appeared without a moustache. Although the film was a box-office failure in India, it proved to be a success overseas. Anil Kapoor's 1991 releases, Benaam Badsha was accorded below average status at the ticket window. In 1992, Kapoor received his second Filmfare Best Actor Award for his hard-hitting performance in Indra Kumar's Beta ‚Äì the biggest blockbuster of the year opposite Madhuri Dixit. Kapoor was highly impressive with his comic act in Khel and his comic timing was one of the highlights of the film. In 1993, Boney Kapoor's much delayed mega-budget, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was a disaster at the box-office and damaged Kapoor's reputation as the industry's biggest star at the time. The only major success in these years was Laadla again with Sridevi, a film produced by Nitin Manmohan. Kapoor gave a splendid performance as a simpleton lover in the hit musical 1942: A Love Story. His 1995 release, Trimurti was a box-office disaster, though Kapoor's performance was creditable. Kapoor came up with a decent performance in the average performer Gharwali Baharwali. After a few box-office failures, he had successes with films like Loafer (1996), opposite Juhi Chawla. In Judaai, Kapoor's depiction of a loving husband torn between his two wives was appreciated and this film fared well at the box-office.

Kapoor again tasted critical and commercial success with Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai in 2000. Kapoor stole the show as Rajeev in the much delayed Karobaar, a film directed by Rakesh Roshan, where Kapoor's dialogue delivery was appreciated. He delivered a powerhouse performance in Shanker's Nayak which is considered to be his best performance by many. In 2002, Kapoor gave an excellent performance in the role of a fat man in Badhaai Ho Badhaai, a takeoff from the Hollywood hit, The Nutty Professor. He notched up yet another glorious performance in the Indra Kumar directed film Rishtey. In Om Jai Jagadish, he gave an amazing performance. Kapoor shared the screen with Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan for the first time in Armaan, and played his character of a neurosurgeon superbly. In his 2003 release, Calcutta Mail, he delivered one of his best performances. His character was defined with ample scope to perform in this screenplay-driven performance and in spite of the strong supporting cast, this really came out as Kapoor's one-man show. He ignited the silver screen with an authoritative performance in Musafir alongside Sameera Reddy, Aditya Pancholi, Sanjay Dutt and Koena Mitra. Kapoor gave an incredibly restrained performance as the stricken husband in the thriller My Wife's Murder, which he also produced. Anees Bazmee's super-hit comedy No Entry (2005), followed for Kapoor that year. The film went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year.

Kapoor played a grey character with finesse in the 2005 thriller, Chocolate. Anil's first release of 2007 Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love was a box office hit in overseas though a flop in India. Anees Bazmee's Welcome, which released on 21 December 2007 was declared the biggest success of the year. Kapoor's understated performance in Subhash Ghai's Black & White was highly lauded. His first release in 2008, Abbas Mustan's thriller, Race became a box-office hit. Vijay Krishna Acharya's, Tashan marked Anil's comeback to Yash Raj Films but failed to do well at the box-office. His most recent films were his first English language film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was released on 12 November 2008, and Yuvvraaj, which was released on 21 November 2008. Yuvvraaj, with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles, failed to do well at the box- office. On the other hand, Slumdog Millionaire has won a number of international awards and received rave reviews from critics, costing only US$15 million to produce, but pulling in more than $352 million worldwide. In January 2009, he attended the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony along with the team of Slumdog Millionaire, which won four Golden Globe Awards. Kapoor demonstrated his well-known enthusiasm after Slumdog won the Academy Award for Best Picture (one of eight awards).

Anil Kapoor's only release of 2012 Tezz earned him favourable reviews from critics; Taran Adarsh wrote that \\"...it's a treat watching Anil Kapoor on screen. Though the actor has been an integral part of so many movies in the past, you can never accuse him of repeating himself. Besides, he may be in his early 50s, but that hasn't deterred Anil from performing the high-octane action stunts with flourish.\\" His performance in Shootout at Wadala was highly acclaimed by critics; Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote that \\"Anil Kapoor is first-rate, revelling in a tailor-made role as a no-nonsense cop, reminding us of the superstar he used to be in the Eighties.\\" In January 2013 Kapoor became the first Indian actor to be invited for a special segment; \\"In conversation\\", at the Toronto International Film Festival, an honour which is reserved for actors having considerable body of work.

The film performed moderately at the box-office, grossing Rs. 155 million in its theatrical run. He has acquired the remake rights for the American TV success, 24, reportedly for an amount of INR 1 billion. It took him about 1.5 years to license the rights to create an Indian rendition of the popular TV show. Kapoor will be stepping into the protagonist's (Jack Bauer) role as well. Kapoor played the role of President Hassan in the 8th season of the original series aired on Fox Network. =Singing= Anil Kapoor has on rare occasions contributed to the soundtracks of his movies as a singer. One of his first playback songs was the title track of the 1986 Bollywood comedy Chameli Ki Shaadi. The song was comic in nature and depicted the love story of the titular Chameli and her lover Charandas, played by Kapoor. Chameli was portrayed by Amrita Singh. In the same decade, he was credited on the song \\"Tere Bina Main Nahin Mere Bina Tu Nahin\\" for the film Woh Saat Din. He is also credited on the song \\"I Love You\\" from Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai. In 2008, Kapoor provided a rhyme-like-dialogue to introduce his character in Yashraj's Tashan.

These downpours may occur locally in a thunderstorm or over a large area, such as following the landfall of a tropical cyclone. If a washout occurs in a crater-like formation, it is called a sinkhole, and it usually involves a leaking or broken water main or sewerage pipes. Other types of sinkholes, such as collapsed caves, are not washouts. Widespread washouts can occur in mountainous areas after heavy rains, even in normally dry ravines. A severe washout can become a landslide, or cause a dam break in an earthen dam. Like other forms of erosion, most washouts can be prevented by vegetation whose roots hold the soil and/or slow the flow of surface and underground water. Deforestation increases the risk of washouts. Retaining walls and culverts may be used to try to prevent washouts, although particularly severe washouts may even destroy these if they are not large or strong enough. Effect on road and rail transport A washout occurred on the Riverside and Great Northern Railway in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, on June 11, 2004. In road and rail transport, a washout is the result of a natural disaster where the roadbed is eroded away by flowing water, usually as the result of a flood. When a washout destroys a railroad's right-of-way, the track is sometimes left suspended in midair across the newly formed gap, or it dips down into a ditch. This phenomenon is discussed in more detail under the term erosion. Bridges may collapse due to bridge scour around one or more bridge abutments or piers. In 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances, and then Hurricane Ivan, caused a large number of washouts in western North Carolina and other parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, closing some roads for days and parts of the Blue Ridge Parkway for months. Other washouts have also caused train wrecks where tracks have been unknowingly undermined. Motorists have also driven into flooded streams at night, unaware of a new washout on the road in front of them until it is too late to brake, sometimes prompting a high-water rescue. Major washouts can also ruin pipelines or undermine utility poles or underground lines, interrupting public utilities.

He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1995, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf M. Zinkernagel in 1996 and was named Australian of the Year in 1997. In the Australia Day Honours of 1997, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work with Zinkernagel. He is also a National Trust Australian Living Treasure. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Doherty's immune system research was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \\"innovation and invention\\". Education and early life Doherty was born in Brisbane, Queensland, where he attended Indooroopilly State High School (which now has a lecture theatre named after him). He received his bachelor's degree in veterinary science in 1962 and his master's degree in veterinary science in 1966 from the University of Queensland. After obtaining his PhD in 1970 from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, he returned to Australia to continue his Nobel Prize- winning research at the John Curtin School of Medical Research within the Australian National University in Canberra. Research and career Doherty's research focuses on the immune system and his Nobel work described how the body's immune cells protect against viruses. He and Rolf Zinkernagel, the co- recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, discovered how T cells recognise their target antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Viruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell ‚Äì not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.

A prequel of sorts to Miller's first published novel, 1934's Tropic of Cancer, it was banned in the United States until a 1961 Justice Department ruling declared that its contents were not obscene. History =Writing= During a three-week vacation from Western Union in 1922, Miller wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings, a study of 12 Western Union messengers. It has never been published; only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in later works, including in the brief portraits of Western Union messengers in Tropic of Capricorn.Mary V. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive: A Biography of Henry Miller, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, pp. 70-71.Henry Miller (ed. Antony Fine), Henry Miller: Stories, Essays, Travel Sketches, New York: MJF Books, 1992, p. 5. In the spring of 1927, Miller was living in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights with his second wife June Miller and her lesbian lover, Jean Kronski. He had recently obtained a new job working for the Parks Department. One day, he returned home to find a note saying they had taken a boat to Paris. Soon after, Miller moved back in with his parents in Brooklyn. One night in May 1927, Miller stayed at the Parks Department office after work and typed up a 32-page document he called June, outlining the details of their relationship. He would use the document as source material for Tropic of Capricorn as well as The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy.Robert Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1991, pp. 153-54. Miller would also repurpose numerous scenes into Tropic of Capricorn from his unpublished third novel Lucky Lesbians (later retitled Crazy Cock), which he worked on from 1928 to 1930 and which was ultimately published in 1991 (over a decade after his death).Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 118. Miller began writing Tropic of Capricorn in earnest toward the end of 1933 while living in Paris. At the time, he was also writing Black Spring, and putting the finishing touches on Tropic of Cancer.Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 231.Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 161. Early on, he referred to Tropic of Capricorn as \\"the June book.\\" His biographer Robert Ferguson called the book Miller's attempt at \\"retrieving in written form as much as possible of the disappearing past.\\"Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, pp. 246-47. Although referred to as \\"the June book,\\" his second wife is more of an influence than a primary character, making only a short appearance.Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, pp. 261-62. The book is dedicated \\"To Her,\\" in reference to June.Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 161, 198. =Publication= Tropic of Capricorn was published in France, in English, by Obelisk Press in February 1939.Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 201-02. A French translation appeared as Tropique du Capricorne in July 1946. Sales of the book, along with Tropic of Cancer, were boosted by the controversy surrounding their censorship, with complaints against Miller and his publisher on charges of pornography.Arthur Hoyle, The Unknown Henry Miller: A Seeker in Big Sur, New York: Arcade Publishing, 2014, pp. 124-25. In the 1940s and 1950s, Miller's books were hard to find and expensive. The banned books were occasionally smuggled into the US, although they were often seized by Customs. In 1944, accompanied by his soon-to-be third wife Janina Martha Lepska, Miller read excerpts from Tropic of Capricorn and Black Spring at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.Hoyle, The Unknown Henry Miller, p. 107. Tropic of Capricorn was banned in the United States until a 1961 Justice Department ruling declared that its contents were not obscene. After Grove Press published the novel in the US in September 1962,Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 349. Miller gained a new, younger generation of readers for his work, which coincided with the sexual revolution of the 1960s. He was seen by many as a champion of the new sexual freedom, and was endorsed by well- known literary figures of the time, including Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac.Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 286. Plot The novel covers Miller's growing inability and outright refusal to accommodate what he sees as America's hostile environment. It is autobiographical but not chronological, jumping between Miller's adolescent adventures in Brooklyn in the 1900s, recollections of his first love Una Gifford, a love affair with his nearly-30-year-old piano teacher when he was 15, his unhappy marriage to his first wife Beatrice, his years working at Western Union (called The Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company in the book) in Manhattan in the 1920s, and his fateful meeting with his second wife June (known in the book as Mara), who he credits with changing his life and making him into a writer. The Rosy Crucifixion continues the story of June, in greater detail, over the course of nearly 1,500 pages, and also described the process of Miller finding his voice as a writer, until eventually he sets off for Paris, where the activities depicted in Tropic of Cancer begin.Hoyle, The Unknown Henry Miller, p. 27.Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 197.Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 65.Frank N.

Large mechanized versions of rakes are used in farming, called hay rakes, are built in many different forms (e.g. star-wheel rakes, rotary rakes, etc.). Nonmechanized farming may be done with various forms of a hand rake.  Types of rakes  Modern hand-rakes usually have steel, plastic, or bamboo teeth or tines, though historically they have been made with wood or iron. The handle is often made of wood or metal. Some rakes are two-sided and made with dull blades in the shapes of slight crescents, used for removing dead grass (thatch) from lawns. When rakes have longer teeth, they may be arranged in the shape of an old-style folding fan. Cultural associations If a rake lies in the ground with the teeth facing upwards, as shown on the top picture, and someone accidentally steps on the teeth, the rake's handle can swing rapidly upwards, colliding with the victim's face. This is often seen in slapstick comedy and cartoons, such as Tom and Jerry and The Simpsons episode \\"Cape Feare\\", wherein a series of rakes become what Sideshow Bob describes as his \\"arch-nemesis\\". There is a Russian saying \\"to step on the same rake\\" (), which means \\"to repeat the same silly mistake\\", also the word \\"rake\\" () in Russian slang means \\"troubles\\". Heavy rake This type of rake is for conditioning and dethatching soil as well as moving larger pieces of debris. Most weeds have weaker and shallower roots than grass and thus dethatching along with (afterward) necessary sunlight, fertilizer and seed, and if later necessary any remedial chemicals, makes for a good crop of grass. Larger tools (or lawnmower attachments) are more often used for large areas of de-thatching or soil preparation. However the action of making the soil bare and exposed to sun is not good and worms do not like it. It should be protected with straw afterward. Soil aeration tools do not remove weed but prepare soil without exposure. Plastic or metal There are pros and cons to each. Plastic rakes are generally lighter weight and lower cost. Because they can be fabricated in widths of greater dimensions they are more suitable for leaves which have recently been deposited. Metal tined rakes are better suited for spring raking when the debris is often wet or rotted and can best be collected when the metal tines penetrate to the thatch layer.

(2011). How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture and the Quantum Revival. W. W. Norton & Company. pp. 15-17, p. 101, p. 254. Biography Stapp received his PhD in particle physics at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Nobel Laureates Emilio Segr√® and Owen Chamberlain. In 1958, Stapp was invited by Wolfgang Pauli to ETH Zurich to work with him personally on basic problems in quantum mechanics. When Pauli died in December 1958, Stapp studied von Neumann's book, and on the basis of that work composed an article entitled \\"Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics\\", which was not submitted for publication; but the title became the title of his 1993 book. In 1969 Stapp was invited by Werner Heisenberg to work with him at the Max Planck Institute in Munich. In 1976 Stapp was invited by J.A. Wheeler to work with him on problems in the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Dr. Stapp has published many papers pertaining to the non-local aspects of quantum mechanics and Bell's theorem, including two books published by Springer- Verlag, and a third one in progress. Stapp has worked also in a number of conventional areas of high energy physics, including analysis of the scattering of polarized protons, parity violation, and S-matrix theory. Research Some of Stapp's work concerns the implications of quantum mechanics (QM). He has argued for the relevance of QM to consciousness and free will. Stapp favors the idea that quantum wave functions collapse only when they interact with consciousness as a consequence of \\"orthodox\\" quantum mechanics. He argues that quantum wave functions collapse when conscious minds select one among the alternative quantum possibilities. His hypothesis of how mind may interact with matter via quantum processes in the brain differs from that of Penrose and Hameroff. While they postulate quantum computing in the microtubules in brain neurons, Stapp postulates a more global collapse, a 'mind like' wave-function collapse that exploits certain aspects of the quantum Zeno effect within the synapses. Stapp's view of the neural correlate of attention is explained in his book, Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Participating Observer (2007). Stapp has claimed that consciousness is fundamental to the universe.Deepak C; Stapp, H. (2014). \\"Is a Mind-Element Needed to Interpret Quantum Mechanics? Do Physically Undetermined Choices Enter into the Evolution of the Physical Universe?\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved 2014-10-28. In this book he credits John von Neumann's Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (1955, 1932) with providing an \\"orthodox\\" quantum mechanics demonstrating mathematically the essential role of quantum physics in the mind. Stapp has taken interest in the work of Alfred North Whitehead. He has proposed what he calls a \\"revised Whiteheadianism\\".Hartshorne, C. (1984). Creativity in American Philosophy. State University of New York Press. p. 108. He has also written a chapter \\"Whiteheadian Process and Quantum Theory\\" (pp. 92‚Äì102) in the book Physics and Whitehead: Quantum, Process, and Experience (2003). His philosophy has been described as being influenced by both Heisenberg's physical realism and Bohr's idealism. A form of panpsychism Philosopher Gordon Globus noted that \\"Stapp unhesitatingly descends into panexperientialism\\".Skrbina, D. (2009). Mind that Abides: Panpsychism in the New Millennium. John Benjamins Publishing Company. p. 72. Stapp has co-authored papers with Jeffrey M. Schwartz. Schwartz has connected the work of Stapp with the concept of \\"mental force\\" and spiritual practices of Buddhism.Schwartz, J. M; Begley, S. (2003). The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force. ReganBooks. Reception Stapp's work has drawn criticism from scientists such as David Bourget and Danko Georgiev. Recent papers and a book by Georgiev criticize Stapp's model in two aspects: (1) The mind in Stapp's model does not have its own wavefunction or density matrix, but nevertheless can act upon the brain using projection operators. Such usage is not compatible with standard quantum mechanics because one can attach any number of ghostly minds to any point in space that act upon physical quantum systems with any projection operators. Therefore, Stapp's model does not build upon \\"the prevailing principles of physics\\", but negates them. (2) Stapp's claim that quantum Zeno effect is robust against environmental decoherence directly contradicts a basic theorem in quantum information theory according to which acting with projection operators upon the density matrix of a quantum system can never decrease the Von Neumann entropy of the system, but can only increase it. Stapp has responded to Bourget and Georgiev stating that the allegations of errors are incorrect.Stapp, H. (2004). \\"Quantum Leaps in Philosophy of Mind: Reply to Bourget's Critique\\".

It was formally founded on 30 March 1971. Before that, the group had been operating under the name Sarawak People's Guerrillas. The chairman of the NKCP was Wen Min Chyuan and the party enjoyed close links with the People's Republic of China. The NKCP's membership was predominantly ethnically Chinese. The two military formations of the NKCP were the Sarawak People's Guerilla Force (SPGF) or Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak (PGRS), and the North Kalimantan People's Army (NKPA) or the Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara (PARAKU). The NKCP participated in the Sarawak Communist Insurgency (1962-1990). On 17 October 1990, the North Kalimantan Communist Party signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak state government, formally ending the Sarawak Communist Insurgency.  Name  The organisation was often referred to by its members as the Sarawak Communist Movement and subsequently the North Kalimantan Communist Party after 1970. Documents published by the Sarawak colonial and Malaysian governments tended to label all anti-colonial groups operating in Sarawak as either the Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) or Sarawak Communist Organisation (SCO). Due to the Cold War atmosphere, anti- colonial groups and left-leaning individuals were often categorised as Communists by the authorities. According to the Japanese academic Fujio Hara, the NKCP's two main military formations were the Sarawak People's Guerilla Force (SPGF) or Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak (PGRS), and the North Kalimantan People's Army (NKPA) or the Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara (PARAKU). The SPGF operated in western Sarawak while the NKPA operated in eastern Sarawak. In addition, the main component organisations were the Sarawak Liberation League (SLL), the Sarawak Advance Youths' Association (SAYA), and the NKPA.  History  = Origins = According to Hong-Kah Fong, the North Kalimantan Communist Party was officially formed on 30 March 1970. However, 19 September 1971 was selected as the official commemoration date in order to commemorate the Pontianak Conference of 17‚Äì19 September 1965, which is regarded as the birth date of the Sarawak Communist Movement. The NKCP traces its origins to local Chinese Communists who had migrated from China to Sabah during the 1930s and 1940s. The NKCP was also preceded by several Communist movements including the Races Liberation Front and the Borneo Anti-Japanese League (which consisted of two organisations: the North Borneo Anti Japanese League and the West Borneo Anti-Japanese League), which had resisted the Japanese occupation during World War II. During the post-war period, other Communist groups active in Sarawak included the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Liberation League, and the Sarawak Advanced Youths' Association (SAYA). By 1965, these had coalesced into two main organisations: the North Kalimantan People's Army (Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara, PARAKU) and the Sarawak People's Guerillas (Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak, PGRS). These were collectively referred to by most British and Western sources as the Sarawak Communist Movement or Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO), which came into existence during the Pontianak Conference in September 1965. According to the historians Vernon L. Porritt and Cheah Boon Kheng, Communist elements were also influential in the Chinese schools during the 1940s. Following the Second World War, Communist elements also infiltrated the Sarawak labour movement and Sarawak's first political party, the predominantly ethnic Chinese Sarawak United People's Party, which was formed in June 1959. In addition, Hsueh Hsih or \\"Communist indoctrination\\" groups were formed in Kuching between 1949 and 1950. Two important figures in the Sarawak Communist movement, Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok, came from Chung Hua Middle School. On 30 March 1954, pro-Communist students at Kuching Chung Hua Middle School organised a 47-day strike to protest against the school administration's teaching methods and its expulsion of students. Communist elements later spread to the business and farming community, many of whom were parents of these left-wing students. = Opposition to Malaysia = The Sarawak Communist Movement was also opposed to the formation of Malaysia, a new political federation which had been created by the British to merge their former Southeast Asian territories of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, and British North Borneo. Instead, the Sarawak Communists supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British control to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. This idea had originally proposed by A. M. Azahari, leader of the Parti Rakyat Brunei (Brunei People‚Äôs Party), who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected to peninsular political domination. According to a British government white paper known as \\"The Communist Threat to Sarawak\\", the so- called \\"Clandestine Communist Organisation\\" had infiltrated the Chinese- language media, trade unions, and had taken over the SUPP. Following the defeat of the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the British authorities in British Borneo, in cooperation with the Malaysian Special Branch, launched a crackdown of suspected Communists which prompted 700-800 Chinese youths to flee to Indonesian Kalimantan. These guerrillas would form the core of the North Kalimantan Communist Party's two guerrilla formations: the Sarawak People's Guerillas (SPGF) and the North Kalimantan People's Army (PARAKU). The Sarawak People's Guerilla Force was formed on 30 March 1964 at Gunung Asuansang in West Kalimantan with the assiance of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The SPGF's leaders included Bong Kee Chok, Yang Chu Chung, and Wen Ming Chyuan. According to Conboy, the PGRS numbered about 800 and was based in West Kalimantan at Batu Hitam, with a contingent of 120 from the Indonesian intelligence agency and a small cadre trained in China. The Indonesian Communist Party was also present and was led by an ethnic Arab revolutionary, Sofyan. The PGRS ran some raids into Sarawak but spent more time developing their supporters in Sarawak. The Indonesian armed forces did not approve of the leftist nature of the PGRS and generally avoided them. According to the former British soldier and writer Will Fowler, these Sarawak Communists received military-style training at Indonesian camps. At that time, President Sukarno was pro-Communist and anti-Western. As with Sukarno and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), the Sarawak Communists opposed the newly formed Federation of Malaysia as a \\"neo-colonialist conspiracy\\" and supported the unification of all former British territories in Borneo to create an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. In addition, the Sarawak Communists had plans to launch attacks on police stations and to ambush security forces, paralleling similar tactics used by the Malayan National Liberation Army during the Malayan Emergency. Meanwhile, the North Kalimantan People's Army was formed by Bong Kee Chok near Sungai Melawi in West Kalimantan with the assistance of the PKI on 26 October 1965. While the SPGF under its commander Yang operated in western Sarawak, the NKPA operated in eastern Sarawak. The NKPA was initially commanded by Lam Wah Kwai, who was succeeded by Bong Kee Chok. According to Kenneth Conboy, Soebandrio met with a group of Sarawak Communist leaders in Bogor, and Nasution sent three trainers from Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat (RPKAD) Battalion 2 to Nangabadan near the Sarawak border, where there were about 300 trainees. Some three months later, two lieutenants were also sent there. The Indonesians had planned to use the Sarawak Communists as an indigenous front for their operations during the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation. To support this ruse, they even named the organisation the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU), to link the Sarawak Communists to the original Bruneian rebels. While the first raids included SCO members, they were often led by regular Indonesian officers or Non-commissioned officers from the Marine commandos (Korps Komando Operasi, KKO), the Army para-commandos (Regimen Para Kommando Angaton Darat, RPKAD), and the Air Force paratroopers ( Pasukan Gerak Tjepat, PGT). Following the 1965 military takeover in Indonesia, General Suharto launched a purge of Communist elements. Overnight, the Sarawak Communists in Indonesia lost a safe haven and the Indonesian military would subsequently cooperate with the Malaysians in counter-insurgency operations against their former allies. Despite the loss of an important ally, PARAKU and the PGRS continued fighting against the Malaysian government during the Sarawak Communist Insurgency which lasted until November 1990. = Decline and fragmentation = Between 1965 and 1990, there were skirmishes which pitted the Sarawak Communist Movement against the Malaysian armed forces. In response to the Communist insurgency, the Malaysian federal government created several \\"controlled areas\\" along the Kuching-Serian road in Sarawak's First and Third Divisions in 1965. These settlements were protected by barbed wire and modelled after the successful New Villages used earlier during the Malayan Emergency. As with the Briggs Plan, the \\"controlled areas\\" succeeded in denying the SCO access to food supplies and material from their Chinese and Dayak supporters. Following the 13 May Incident in 1969, all Communist elements were expelled from the SUPP and moderate elements gained control over the party. The SUPP then entered into a coalition with the ruling Bumiputera Party in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly. On 30 March 1970, Wen Ming Chyuan, the Head of the Sarawak People's Guerrillas in Sarawak's First Division, formed the North Kalimantan Communist Party. However, 19 September 1971 was chosen as the official date of the formation of the party to coincide with the Pontianak Conference, which had been held on 17-19 September 1965. While the Pontianak Conference was regarded as the foundation of the Sarawak Communist Movement, none of the conference attendees were Communist. Instead, they consisted of members of the left-wing Liberation League and the \\"O Members\\" of the Advanced Youths Association. While they had discussed creating a Communist party in Sarawak, they delayed doing so until 1971 due to the tense political situation in Indonesia. The Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub also made several overtures to the NKCP insurgents and managed to convince several of the insurgents to lay down their arms. In 1973‚Äì74, the Malaysian government scored a key victory when Rahman Ya'kub successfully convinced Bong Kee Chok, the Director and Commissar of the North Kalimantan People's Army, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sarawak government. Following this event, between 481-580 members of the North Kalimantan People's Army and the Sarawak People's Guerillas surrendered and returned to society. This was a heavy loss for the Sarawak Communist Movement since this number comprised approximately 75 per cent of its entire force in Sarawak. After this defection, only 121 guerrilla fighters led by Hung Chu Ting and Wong Lian Kui remained. By 1974, the Communist insurgency had become confined to the Rejang Delta. Both sides sustained casualties and many civilians were also killed and wounded in the cross-fire. Following the successful Hat Yai peace accords between the Malayan Communist Party and the Malaysian government in 1989, the remaining North Kalimantan Communist Party guerillas decided to end their insurgency after one of their Chinese contacts Weng Min Chyuan convinced them to negotiate with the Sarawak state government. In July 1990, a series of negotiations between the NKCP and the Sarawak government took place at the town of Bintulu. By 17 October 1990, a peace agreement formally ending the Sarawak communist insurgency was ratified at Wisma Bapa Malaysia in the state capital Kuching. Shortly afterwards, the last remaining NKCP operatives led by Ang Cho Teng surrendered. These developments ended the Sarawak Communist insurgency.

It is one of two regiments, along with the Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers, to be classed as 'Guards'. Regimental History A group of Dutch soldiers were forced to withdraw in May 1940 after the unexpected invasion of the Netherlands by the Nazi armies. Faced by the choice: to surrender or to continue the fight alongside the Western Allies, they opted for the latter. Via several ways they finally arrived in Great Britain, where they formed a new unit: the Royal Dutch Brigade. The unit was later renamed to become the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade. In August 1941 this unit received from the hands of the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina, who remained in exile in England, its own regimental colors. In addition the unit was given the honorary name of 'Princess Irene', named after the Queen's second granddaughter. This name is also symbolic, as the name of Irene means: 'she who brings peace' (in Greek). As a small detachment in the British Liberation Army (the unit only numbered approximately 1400 men) the Brigade took part in the campaign in Western Europe. In May 1945 the Nazis capitulated in the Netherlands which also led to the disbanding of the Irene Brigade, which to a large extent was made up of war volunteers and conscripts. To remember their special bond, the men of 'the first hour' proudly wore their special distinction: an orange-blue lanyard called 'invasion-lanyard'. The regimental colors of the Royal Dutch Brigade 'Princess Irene' were decorated with the highest military order for valor known in the Dutch Army. So as not to let the name of that small Dutch unit fade into history, it was decided that the traditions surrounding the regimental colors were to be continued by a new regiment. The Princess Irene Regiment was formed in April 1946. Five battalions of the new regiment were on active duty during the so-called 'police-actions' in the years 1946 - 1949 in the former Netherlands East Indies, or to-day's Indonesia. Ninety young Dutch 'Irene' soldiers were killed during these operations. The Regiment Princess Irene became Guards Regiment Fusiliers Princess Irene in 1948. The traditions of the regiment were carried on by 13th Armored Infantry Battalion of the Royal Dutch Army in the Westenbergbarracks in Schalkhaar (near Deventer). In June 1992 the 17th Armored Infantry Battalion took over the traditions. Since then, the regimental colors, monument and museum are settled in the General- major De Ruyter van Steveninckbarracks named after the commander of the Irene Brigade ) in Oirschot. 17th Armored Infantry Battalion Guards Regiment Fusiliers Princess Irene is part of 13 Motorized Brigade. In June - December 1996 the battalion was transferred to Bosnia (former Yugoslavia). As 17 (NL) Mechanized Battalion Guards Regiment Princess Irene they served in the IFOR-II operation under British command, just as the Irene Brigade 50 years before them. In Bosnia the men and women of the battalion wore the invasion-lanyard of the former Irene Brigade on active duty. It was handed over to them by veterans of the brigade to illustrate the bond with their young colleagues. This was only the beginning of the peacekeeping operations for the Fusiliers. They went to Bosnia again in December - June 1999 as part of the SFOR5 force. June - December 1999 13 Fusiliers stayed on Cyprus, with UNICYP3. A Fusiliers company served in Kosovo (Jan - May 2000) with KFOR2. In December 2002 17 (NL) Mechanized Battalion Guards Regiment Princess Irene will stay in Bosnia for the 3rd time as part of SFOR13. Further missions were Iraq 2004 and 2005 and Afghanistan 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2016. Ceremonial uniform When the regiment was promoted to the status of guards in 1948, they adopted a ceremonial uniform. To commemorate the unit's foundation in the United Kingdom, it was decided to adopt the style of the traditional British \\"full dress\\" infantry uniform, with a scarlet tunic and the dark blue \\"Home Service\\" helmet, which is also used by the Netherlands Marine Corps.Rinaldo D.

He is noted for his large size, at , and for his high intellect, possessing an IQ of 145. Kemper was nicknamed the Co-ed Killer as most of his victims were female college students. Born in California, Kemper had a disturbed upbringing. His parents divorced and he moved to Montana with his abusive mother as a child before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a criminally insane juvenile. Released at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his future victims. He targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. Found sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, Kemper requested the death penalty for his crimes. Capital punishment was suspended in California at the time, and he instead received eight concurrent life sentences. Since then, he has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility. Kemper has waived his right to a parole hearing several times and has said he is happy in prison. Early life Edmund Emil Kemper III was born in Burbank, California on December 18, 1948. He was the middle child and only son born to Clarnell Elizabeth Kemper (n√©e Stage, 1921‚Äì1973) and Edmund Emil Kemper II (1919‚Äì1985). Edmund II was a World War II veteran who, after the war, tested nuclear weapons in the Pacific Proving Grounds before returning to California, where he worked as an electrician. Clarnell often complained about Edmund II's \\"menial\\" electrician job, and he later said \\"suicide missions in wartime and the atomic bomb testings were nothing compared to living with her\\" and that Clarnell affected him \\"more than three hundred and ninety-six days and nights of fighting on the front did.\\" Weighing as a newborn, Kemper was a head taller than his peers by the age of four. Early on, he exhibited antisocial behavior such as cruelty to animals: At the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive; once it died, he dug it up, decapitated it, and mounted its head on a spike. Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat. At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him, and kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them. Kemper had a dark fantasy life: he performed rituals with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943‚Äì2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied: \\"If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first.\\" He also recalled that as a young boy he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second- grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. He stated in later interviews that some of his favorite games to play as a child were \\"Gas Chamber\\" and \\"Electric Chair\\", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up and flip an imaginary switch, and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending that he was being executed by gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had near-death experiences as a child: once, when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned. Kemper had a close relationship with his father and was devastated when his parents separated in 1957, causing him to be raised by Clarnell in Helena, Montana. He had a severely dysfunctional relationship with his mother, a neurotic, domineering alcoholic who frequently belittled, humiliated, and abused him. Clarnell often made her son sleep in a locked basement, because she feared that he would harm his sisters, regularly mocked him for his large size‚Äîhe stood by the age of 15‚Äîand derided him as \\"a real weirdo.\\" She also refused to show him affection out of fear that she would \\"turn him gay\\", and told the young Kemper that he reminded her of his father and that no woman would ever love him. Kemper later described her as a \\"sick angry woman,\\" and it has been postulated that she suffered from borderline personality disorder. At the age of 14, Kemper ran away from home in an attempt to reconcile with his father in Van Nuys, California. Once there, he learned that his father had remarried and had a stepson. Kemper stayed with his father for a short while until the elder Kemper sent him to live with his paternal grandparents, who lived on a ranch in the mountains of North Fork, California. Kemper hated living in North Fork; he described his grandfather as \\"senile,\\" and said that his grandmother \\"was constantly emasculating me and my grandfather.\\" First murders On August 27, 1964, aged 15, Kemper was sitting at the kitchen table with his grandmother Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (b. 1897), when they had an argument. Enraged, Kemper stormed off and retrieved a rifle that his grandfather had given him for hunting. He then re-entered the kitchen and fatally shot his grandmother in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts mention that she also suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (b. 1892), returned from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next, so he phoned his mother, who told him to contact the local police. Kemper called the police and waited to be taken into custody. After his arrest, Kemper said that he \\"just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma\\" and testified that he killed his grandfather so he would not have to find out that his wife was dead. Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote \\"In his way, he had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother.\\" Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic, then sent him to Atascadero State Hospital: a maximum-security facility that houses mentally ill convicts. =Imprisonment= At Atascadero, California Youth Authority psychiatrists and social workers disagreed with the court psychiatrists' diagnoses. Their reports stated that Kemper showed \\"no flight of ideas, no interference with thought, no expression of delusions or hallucinations, and no evidence of bizarre thinking.\\" They also observed him to be intelligent and introspective. Initial testing measured his IQ at 136, over two standard deviations above average. He was re-diagnosed with a less severe condition, a \\"personality trait disturbance, passive-aggressive type.\\" Later on in his time at Atascadero, Kemper was given another IQ test, which gave a higher result of 145. Kemper endeared himself to his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to administer psychiatric tests to other inmates. One of his psychiatrists later said: \\"He was a very good worker and this is not typical of a sociopath. He really took pride in his work.\\" Kemper also became a member of the Jaycees while in Atascadero and said he developed \\"some new tests and some new scales on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,\\" specifically an \\"Overt Hostility Scale,\\" during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists. After his second arrest, Kemper said that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists and admitted that he learned a lot from the sex offenders to whom he administered tests; for example, they told him it was best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses. Release and time between murders On December 18, 1969, his 21st birthday, Kemper was released on parole from Atascadero. Against the recommendations of psychiatrists at the hospital, he was released into the care of his mother Clarnell‚Äîwho had remarried, taken the surname Strandberg, and then divorced again‚Äîat 609 A Ord Street, Aptos, California, a short drive from where she worked as an administrative assistant at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Kemper later demonstrated further to his psychiatrists that he was rehabilitated, and on November 29, 1972, his juvenile records were permanently expunged. The last report from his probation psychiatrists read: While staying with his mother, Kemper attended community college in accordance with his parole requirements and had hoped he would become a police officer, but was rejected because of his size‚Äîat the time of his release from Atascadero, Kemper stood tall‚Äîwhich led to his nickname, \\"Big Ed\\". Kemper maintained relationships with Santa Cruz police officers despite his rejection to join the force and became a self- described \\"friendly nuisance\\" at a bar called the Jury Room, which was a popular hangout for local law enforcement officers. Kemper worked a series of menial jobs before gaining employment with the State of California Division of Highways (now known as the California Department of Transportation). During this time, his relationship with Clarnell remained toxic and hostile with them having frequent arguments that their neighbors often overheard. Kemper later described the arguments he had with his mother around this time, stating: When he had saved enough money, Kemper moved out to live with a friend in Alameda, California. There, he still complained of being unable to get away from his mother because she regularly phoned him and paid him surprise visits. He often had financial difficulties, which resulted in his frequently returning to his mother's apartment in Aptos. At a Santa Cruz beach, Kemper met a student from Turlock High School to whom he became engaged in March 1973. The engagement was broken off after Kemper's second arrest and his fianc√©e's parents requested her name not be revealed to the public. The same year he began working for the Highway Division, Kemper was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle that he had recently purchased. His arm was badly injured in the crash and he received a $15,000 (about $90,000 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation) settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car's driver. As he was driving around in the 1969 Ford Galaxie he bought with part of his settlement money, he noticed a large number of young women hitchhiking and began storing plastic bags, knives, blankets and handcuffs in his car. He then began picking up young women and peacefully letting them go. According to Kemper, he picked up around 150 such hitchhikers before he felt homicidal sexual urges, which he called his \\"little zapples,\\" and began acting on them. Later murders Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper killed eight people. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their bodies back to his home where he decapitated them, performed irrumatio on their severed heads, had sexual intercourse with their corpses, and then dismembered them. During this 11-month murder spree, he killed five college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he often searched for victims after having arguments with his mother, and that she refused to introduce him to women attending the university where she worked. He recalled: \\"She would say, 'You're just like your father. You don't deserve to get to know them'.\\" Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target: his mother. =Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Luchessa= On May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in Berkeley, California when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking students from Fresno State University, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, California, with which he was familiar from his work at the Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, then stabbed and strangled Pesce to death, then killed Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he \\"brushed the back of [his] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [him]\\", adding that he said \\"'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that\\" after grazing her breast despite murdering her minutes later. Kemper put both of the women's bodies in the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and returned to his apartment. He was stopped on the way by a police officer for having a broken taillight, but the officer did not detect the corpses in the car. Kemper's roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took photographs of, and had sexual intercourse with the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August of that year, Pesce's skull was found on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of Pesce's remains or a trace of Luchessa. =Aiko Koo= On the evening of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up a 15-year-old dance student named Aiko Koo, who had decided to hitchhike to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, where he pulled a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside as he had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint. Back inside the car, he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her, and kill her. Kemper subsequently packed Koo's body into the trunk of his car and went to a nearby bar to have a few drinks, then returned to his apartment. He later confessed that after exiting the bar, he opened the trunk of his car, \\"admiring [his] catch like a fisherman.\\" Back at his apartment, he had sexual intercourse with the corpse, then dismembered and disposed of the remains in a similar manner as his previous two victims. Koo's mother called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information, but did not receive any responses regarding her daughter's location or status. =Cindy Schall= On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had moved back in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann \\"Cindy\\" Schall. He drove to a wooded area and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sexual intercourse with and removed the bullet from Schall's corpse, then dismembered and decapitated her in his mother's bathtub. Kemper kept Schall's severed head for several days, regularly engaging in irrumatio with it, then buried it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom. After his arrest, he stated that he did this because his mother \\"always wanted people to look up to her.\\" He discarded the rest of Schall's remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all except her head and right hand were discovered and \\"pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.\\" A pathologist determined that Schall had been cut into pieces with a power saw. =Rosalind Thorpe and Allison Liu= On February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims. With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only accept rides from cars with university stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at University of California, Santa Cruz. He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen \\"Allison\\" Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, who reassured Liu to also enter. He then fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with his .22 caliber pistol and wrapped their bodies in blankets. Kemper again brought his victims back to his mother's house; this time he beheaded them in his car and carried the headless corpses into his mother's house to have sexual intercourse with them. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification, and the next morning, discarded their remains. Some remains were found at Eden Canyon a week later, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in an interview as to why he decapitated his victims, he explained: \\"The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off ... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head.\\" =Clarnell Strandberg and Sally Hallett= On April 20, 1973, after coming home from a party, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg awakened her son with her arrival. While sitting in her bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said to him \\"I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now.\\" Kemper replied \\"No, good night.\\" He then waited for her to fall asleep, returned to bludgeon her with a claw hammer, and slit her throat with a knife. He subsequently decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head, then used it as a dart board. Kemper stated that he \\"put [her head] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour ... threw darts at it,\\" and, ultimately, \\"smashed her face in.\\" He also cut out her tongue and larynx and put them in the garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. \\"That seemed appropriate,\\" Kemper later said: \\"as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years.\\" Kemper then hid his mother's corpse in a closet and went to drink at a nearby bar. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor \\"Sally\\" Hallett, over to the house to have dinner and watch a movie. When Hallett arrived, Kemper strangled her to death to create a cover story that his mother and Hallett had gone away together on vacation. He subsequently put Hallett's corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance, and left a note to the police. It read: Afterward, Kemper fled the scene. He drove non-stop to Pueblo, Colorado, taking caffeine pills to stay awake for the over 1,000-mile journey. He had three guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his car, and believed he was the target of an active manhunt. After not hearing any news on the radio about the murders of his mother and Hallett when he arrived in Pueblo, he found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again, asking to speak to an officer he personally knew. He confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited for the police to arrive and take him into custody, where he also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked in a later interview why he turned himself in, Kemper said: \\"The original purpose was gone ... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time ... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off.\\" Trial 150px Kemper was indicted on eight counts of first-degree murder on May 7, 1973. He was assigned the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson. Due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit suicide in custody. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973. Three court-appointed psychiatrists found Kemper to be legally sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis that he was once psychotic. Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer. Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism. California used the M'Naghten standard, which held that for a defendant to \\"establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\\" Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts was wrong, and had shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the victims because he wanted them \\"for myself, like possessions,\\" and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind. He said two beings inhabited his body and that when the killer personality took over it was \\"kind of like blacking out.\\" On November 8, 1973, the six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for five hours before declaring Kemper sane and guilty on all counts. He asked for the death penalty, requesting \\"death by torture.\\" However, with a moratorium placed on capital punishment by the Supreme Court of California, he instead received seven years to life for each count, with these terms to be served concurrently, and was sentenced to the California Medical Facility. Imprisonment In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in the same prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time and in the same area as Kemper. He described Mullin as \\"just a cold-blooded killer...killing everybody he saw for no good reason.\\" Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at , was more than a foot shorter than he. Kemper stated that \\"[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment.\\" Kemper remains among the general population in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He was in charge of scheduling other inmates' appointments with psychiatrists and was an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups. He was also a prolific reader of audiobooks for the blind; a 1987 Los Angeles Times article stated that he was the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name. He was retired from these positions in 2015, after he experienced a stroke and was declared medically disabled. He received his first rules violation report in 2016 for failing to provide a urine sample. Kemper on November 17, 2011 While imprisoned, Kemper has participated in a number of interviews, including a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews have contributed to the understanding of the mind of serial killers. FBI profiler John Douglas described Kemper as \\"among the brightest\\" prison inmates he interviewed and capable of \\"rare insight for a violent criminal.\\" Kemper is forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has stated that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing. At the end of his Murder: No Apparent Motive interview, he said: \\"There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that ‚Äì hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing. It doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts.\\" He also conducted an interview with French writer St√©phane Bourgoin in 1991. Kemper was first eligible for parole in 1979. He was denied parole that year, as well as at parole hearings in 1980, 1981, and 1982. He subsequently waived his right to a hearing in 1985. He was denied parole at his 1988 hearing, where he said: \\"society is not ready in any shape or form for me. I can't fault them for that.\\" He was denied parole again in 1991 and in 1994. He then waived his right to a hearing in 1997 and in 2002. He attended the next hearing, in 2007, where he was again denied parole. Prosecutor Ariadne Symons said: \\"We don't care how much of a model prisoner he is because of the enormity of his crimes.\\" Kemper waived his right to a hearing again in 2012. He was denied parole in 2017 and is next eligible in 2024. In popular culture Kemper has influenced many works of film and literature. He was an inspiration for the character of Buffalo Bill in Thomas Harris' 1988 novel The Silence of the Lambs. Like Kemper, Bill fatally shoots his grandparents as a teenager. Dean Koontz cited Kemper as an inspiration for character Edgler Vess in his 1996 novel Intensity. The character Patrick Bateman in the 2000 film American Psycho mistakenly attributes a quote by Kemper to Ed Gein, saying: \\"You know what Ed Gein said about women? ... He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right ... [the other part wonders] what her head would look like on a stick'.\\" A direct-to-video horror film loosely based on Kemper's murders, titled Kemper: The CoEd Killer, was released in 2008. French author Marc Dugain published a novel, Avenue des g√©ants (Avenue of the Giants), about Kemper in 2012. Kemper was portrayed by actor Cameron Britton in the 2017 Netflix television drama series Mindhunter. Britton received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series because of this role. Extracts from Kemper's interviews have been used in numerous songs, including \\"Love // Hate\\" by Dystopia, \\"Abomination Unseen\\" by Devourment, \\"Forever\\" by The Berzerker, \\"Severed Head\\" by Suicide Commando and \\"Crave\\" by Optimum Wound Profile. He is discussed in many songs, such as \\"Edmund Kemper Had a Horrible Temper\\" by Macabre, \\"Fortress\\" by System of a Down, \\"Temper Temper Mr. Kemper\\" by The Celibate Rifles, \\"Murder\\" by Seabound, and \\"Killfornia (Ed Kemper)\\" by Church of Misery.

At the time of their disappearance they were aged nine, seven, and four years respectively. Police investigations revealed that, on the day of their disappearance, several witnesses had seen the children on and near Glenelg Beach in the company of a tall blond and thin-faced man with a sun-tanned complexion of thin to athletic build, aged in his mid-30s. Confirmed sightings of the three children occurred at the Colley Reserve and at Wenzels Cake shop on Moseley Street, Glenelg. Despite numerous searches, neither the children nor their suspected companion were located. The case attracted widespread police and media attention in Australia and across the globe, quickly attracting numerous suspects, hoaxes and theories. The regular and widespread attention given to the case, its significance in Australian criminal history and the fact that the mystery of their disappearance has never been explained has led to the story being of continuous public interest. New leads and clues are regularly reported on and the case still regularly headlines print and broadcast media more than half a century on. , an A$1 million reward has been offered for information related to the cold case by the South Australian Government. The disappearance is widely credited with causing a change in Australian lifestyles, since parents began to believe that their children could no longer be presumed to be safe when unsupervised in public. Background The beachside suburb of Glenelg where the Beaumont children were last seen Jane, Arnna and Grant Beaumont lived with their parents, Grant \\"Jim\\" Beaumont, a former serviceman and driver for Suburban Taxis, and Nancy Beaumont (n√©e Ellis), who had married in December 1955. Their house was at 109 Harding Street, Somerton Park, a suburb of Adelaide, not far from Glenelg Beach, a popular spot that the children and many others at the height of the surf music era often visited. On 25 January, in the midst of a summer heatwave, Jim Beaumont dropped the children off at Glenelg Beach before heading off on a three-day sales trip to Snowtown. Jane, the eldest child, was considered responsible enough to care for the two younger siblings and, given the social conditions of the time, their parents were not concerned about the trip. On the morning of 26 January 1966 (Australia Day), the children asked their mother to visit the beach again. As it was too hot to walk, they took a five-minute three-kilometre bus journey from their home to the beach. They caught the bus at 8:45 am and were expected to return home on the 12:00 noon bus. Nancy Beaumont became worried, however, when the children did not return on either the 12:00 or 2:00 pm buses, and when Jim Beaumont returned home early from his trip around 3:00 pm, he immediately drove to the crowded beach. Unable to locate them, he returned and together they searched the streets and visited friends' houses. Around 5:30 pm, they went to the Glenelg Police Station to notify them of the disappearance. Police investigation Police quickly organised a search of the beach and adjacent areas, based on the assumption that the children were nearby and had simply lost track of time. The search then expanded to the sand-hills, ocean, and nearby buildings, with the airport, rail lines, and interstate roads being monitored too, based on a fear of accident or kidnap. Within 24 hours, the entire nation was aware of the case. Within three days, on 29 January, the Sunday Mail led with a headline of \\"Sex crime now feared\\", highlighting the rapidly evolving fear that they had been abducted and murdered by a sex-offender; despite this, the initial official reward was only A¬£250. Police quickly established that between them the children were carrying 17 individual items, including clothing, towels, and bags, but none of these items were ever found. The Patawalonga Boat Haven was drained on 29 January after a woman told police that she had spoken with three children, who were similar in description to the Beaumont children, near the haven at 7:00 pm on 26 January. Police cadets and members of the emergency operations group searched the area, but nothing was found. =Prime suspect= Police investigating the case found several witnesses who had seen the children in Colley Reserve near the beach in the company of a tall, blond and thin-faced man in his mid-30s, of a sun-tanned complexion and of thin-to-athletic build, wearing swimming trunks. The children were playing with him and appeared relaxed and to be enjoying themselves. The man also approached one of the witnesses, however, asking if anyone had been near their belongings as their money was \\"missing\\". The man then went off to change while the children waited for him, and the group were seen walking together away from the beach some time later, which the police estimated to be around 12:15 pm. The Beaumonts described their children, particularly Jane, as shy. For them to be playing so confidently with a stranger seemed out of character. Investigators theorised that the children had perhaps met the man during a previous visit or visits and had grown to trust him. A chance remark at home, which seemed insignificant at the time, supports this theory. Arnna had told her mother that Jane had \\"got a boyfriend down the beach\\". Nancy Beaumont thought she meant a playmate and took no further notice until after the disappearance. A shopkeeper at nearby Wenzel's Bakery also reported Jane had bought pasties and a meat pie with a ¬£1 note. Police viewed this as further evidence that they had been with another person, for two reasons: the shopkeeper knew the children well from previous visits and reported that they had never purchased a meat pie before, and the children's mother had given them only 6 shillings and 6 pence, enough for their bus fare and lunch, and not ¬£1. Police believed it had been given to them by somebody else. =Other sightings= According to an initial statement, the children were seen walking alone at about 3:00 pm, away from the beach along Jetty Road, in the general direction of their home. The witness, a postman, knew the children well, and his statement was regarded as reliable. He said the children were \\"holding hands and laughing\\" in the main street. Police could not determine why the reliable children, already one hour late, were strolling alone and seemingly unconcerned. This was the last confirmed sighting of the children. The postman contacted police two days after his initial statement and said that he thought he saw them in the morning, not the afternoon as he had previously said. Several months later a woman reported that on the night of the disappearance, a man, accompanied by two girls and a boy, entered a neighbouring house that she had believed empty. Later she had seen the boy walking alone along a lane where he was pursued and roughly caught by the man. The next morning the house appeared to be deserted again, and she saw neither the man nor the children again. Police could not establish why she had failed to provide this information earlier. Other reported sightings of the children continued for about a year after their disappearance. =Gerard Croiset= The case also attracted international attention. On 8 November 1966, Gerard Croiset, a parapsychologist and psychic from the Netherlands, was brought to Australia, causing a media frenzy. His search for the children proved unsuccessful, with his story changing from day to day and offering no clues. He identified a site in a warehouse near the children's home (and also near the Paringa Park Primary School attended by Jane and Arnna) in which he believed the children's bodies had been buried. At the time of their disappearance it had been a building site, and he said that he believed their bodies were buried under new concrete, inside the remains of an old brick kiln. The property owners, who were reluctant to excavate on the basis of a psychic's claim, soon bowed to public pressure after publicity raised $40,000 to have the building demolished. No remains, or any evidence linking to any of the Beaumont family, were found. In 1996, the building identified by Croiset was undergoing partial demolition and the owners allowed for a full search of the site. Once again no trace was found of the children. =Hoax letters= About two years after the disappearance, the Beaumont parents received two letters supposedly written by Jane, and another by a man who said he was keeping the children. The envelopes showed a postmark of Dandenong, Victoria. The brief notes describe a relatively pleasant existence and refer to \\"The Man\\" who was keeping them. Police believed at the time that the letters could quite likely have been authentic after comparing them with others written by Jane. The letter from \\"The Man\\" said that he had appointed himself \\"guardian\\" of the children and was willing to hand them back to their parents. In the letter a meeting place was nominated. The Beaumont parents, followed by a detective, drove to the designated place but nobody appeared. It was some time later that a third letter, also purported to be from Jane, arrived. It said that the man had been willing to return them, but when he realised a disguised detective was also there, he decided that the Beaumonts had betrayed his trust and that he would keep the children. There were no further letters. In 1992, new forensic examinations of the letters showed they were a hoax. Fingerprint technology had improved and the author was identified as a 41-year-old man who had been a teenager at the time and had written the letters as a joke. Because of the time that had elapsed, he was not charged with any offence.The Advertiser (Adelaide), 6 June 1992 =Later developments= In November 2013, excavation was initiated in the back of a North Plympton factory that had previously belonged to one possible suspect in the case, Harry Phipps (see below); further excavation at a slightly different location on the site was undertaken in February 2018. Nothing relevant was found. The excavations were based on two men reporting that as boys they had been paid to dig a hole in that area at around the time, and geophysical testing which had identified anomalous disturbed soil. Animal bones were found, but nothing relating to the Beaumont children. Possible suspects =Bevan Spencer von Einem= Bevan Spencer von Einem was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1984 for murdering 15-year-old Richard Kelvin, son of Adelaide newsreader Rob Kelvin.O'Brien, Bob (2002). Young Blood: The Story of the Family Murders. HarperCollins. . Police and prosecutors publicly stated that they believed von Einem had accomplices and was possibly involved in additional murders. About this same time, police came to suspect von Einem of possible involvement in the Beaumont children disappearance. No accomplices were ever charged. Von Einem has refused to co-operate with investigators about his possible connection with other murders. During the investigation into von Einem, police heard from an informant identified only as \\"Mr B\\". He related an alleged conversation in which von Einem boasted of having taken three children from a beach several years earlier, and said he had taken them home to conduct \\"experiments\\". Von Einem had said that he performed \\"brilliant surgery\\" on each of them, and had \\"connected them up\\". One of the children had supposedly died during the procedure and so he had killed the other two and dumped all the bodies in bushland south of Adelaide. Police had not previously considered von Einem in connection with the Beaumont children, but he somewhat resembled the descriptions and police sketches from 1966. According to Adelaide police detective Bob O'Brien, Mr B gave important information during the investigation into the Kelvin murder, and was regarded as a generally reliable source. However, police reception of the alleged confession was mixed. There were enough plausible details to warrant further research, yet other details relayed by Mr B did not fit with known facts and were regarded with skepticism by police. , von Einem had not been ruled out as a suspect. While von Einem was known to have frequented Glenelg Beach to \\"perv\\" on the changing rooms, and was described as preoccupied with children, what argues against his involvement in the Beaumont case is that he was younger than the suspect seen with the children in 1966 (the suspect was reported to be in his mid- to late-30s, whereas von Einem was 20 or 21 at the time). Another important distinction is that von Einem was convicted of murdering a 15-year- old boy and suspected of killing males in their teens and twenties; victims older than the Beaumont children and the children who were abducted from the Adelaide Oval. Such disparities amongst victims of a serial killer are not unheard of, but unusual. The reference to surgical experimentation von Einem had purportedly made to Mr B also corresponded to the coroner's reports on several of the murdered youths. Von Einem also told the witness that he had taken two girls from the Adelaide Oval during a football match. He said he had killed them but did not elaborate. The cases of the Beaumont children and of Joanne Ratcliffe and Kirste Gordon remain officially open. However, von Einem matched the police sketches of the suspect in both the Beaumont and Oval cases and, in 1989, he was identified as a suspect in a confidential police report. In August 2007, it was reported that police were examining archival footage from the original search, shot by Channel Seven, that shows a young man resembling von Einem among onlookers. The report said that police were calling for information to establish the man's identity. =Arthur Stanley Brown= Arthur Stanley Brown, (1912-2002), was charged in 1998 with the murders of sisters Judith and Susan Mackay in Townsville, Queensland. They disappeared while on their way to school on 26 August 1970 and their bodies were found several days later in a dry creek bed. Both girls had been strangled. Brown's July 2000 trial was delayed after his lawyer applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. He was never retried as he was found to have dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Brown died in 2002. Along with von Einem, Brown is considered to be the most likely suspect for the Beaumont abduction as he bore a striking similarity to an identikit picture of the suspect for both the Beaumont and Adelaide Oval cases. A search for a connection to the Beaumonts was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on his movements at the time. Some of the records were believed lost in the 1974 Brisbane flood. It is also possible that Brown, who had unrestricted access to government buildings, may have deleted his own files. Although there is no proof that he had ever visited Adelaide, a witness recalled having a conversation with Brown in which he mentioned having seen the Adelaide Festival Centre nearing completion, which places him in the city in June 1973. The Oval abduction occurred on 25 August 1973. However, no evidence has ever been found to connect Brown with Adelaide in 1966, when the Beaumont children were abducted. Another witness, who reported seeing a manThe suspect in both crimes wore a distinctive wide-brimmed hat with a low, flat crown. Rare in Adelaide, the hat was common in the north of Australia. near the Oval carrying a young girl while another older girl in distress followed, later identified Brown as the man she had seen after seeing his picture on television in December 1998 in relation to the MacKay murders. The woman who identified the abductor as Brown first saw him for a single minute when aged 14, and then identified him as Brown 25 years later when she saw him as an 86-year-old on television. Brown's appearance, in fact, had barely changed, and he was still very much recognisable as the same person when compared to photographs of him taken 30 years earlier, which was a factor in identifying him as matching the sketch of the suspect in the Beaumont and Oval abductions. Additionally, she had reported that the man was wearing a pair of horn rimmed glasses, a pair of which Brown is known to have worn, something considered by police to be another noteworthy point in the identification. Brown was 53 at the time of the Beaumont disappearance, which does not match the description of the suspect seen with the children, who was reported as being in his late thirties. =James Ryan O'Neill= In the early 1970s, James O'Neill, who was jailed for life in 1975 for the murder of a 9-year-old boy in Tasmania, had told a station owner in the Kimberley and several other acquaintances that he was responsible for the disappearance of the Beaumont children. In 2006, O'Neill lost an injunction in the High Court of Australia to stop the broadcast of a documentary The Fishermen which attempted to link him to the Beaumont case. The documentary aired on 26 October 2006 on the ABC. Former Victorian detective Gordon Davie spent three years speaking to O'Neill to win his confidence before filming him for the documentary. Davie said that although there was no evidence to link O'Neill to the disappearance, he was persuaded that O'Neill was to blame. \\"I asked him about the Beaumonts and he said: 'I couldn't have done it. I was in Melbourne at that time.' That is not a denial.\\" Later asked again if he had murdered the children, he replied, \\"Look, on legal advice I am not going to say where I was or when I was there.\\" Although O'Neill claims never to have visited Adelaide, his work in the opal industry at the time required that he frequently visit Coober Pedy, which would have required him to pass through Adelaide. Davie also suspected O'Neill was involved in the disappearance of Ratcliffe and Gordon in 1973. South Australian police have interviewed O'Neill and discounted him as a suspect in the Beaumont case. =Derek Ernest Percy= On 22 April 2007, a report in The Age suggested that the Beaumont children may have been killed by Derek Ernest Percy (1948-2013), Victoria's then longest-serving prisoner. Percy was in prison until his death in 2013, after being found not guilty by reason of insanity for the 1969 murder of Yvonne Tuohy. The Age alleged that evidence gathered by cold-case investigators indicated that he was a likely suspect for a number of unsolved child murders, including the Beaumont children. His insanity plea in the Tuohy murder was at least partly based on his suffering a psychological condition that could prevent him remembering details of his actions. He was supposed to have indicated that he believed he might have killed the Beaumont children, as he was in the area at the time, but he had no recollection of actually doing so. On 30 August 2007, Victoria Police successfully applied for permission to question Percy in relation to the Beaumont disappearance. In 1966, Percy was 17 and therefore seems too young to have been the man seen with the Beaumont children by several witnesses. It is also unknown whether Percy would have had a car at that time, while the Beaumont children suspect is presumed by commentators to have had access to one for facilitating a quick getaway and also for disposing of the children's bodies later. Percy was in prison from 1969 until his death in 2013, which means that he could not have been the abductor in the Oval case, whom many of the police who investigated both cases believe to be connected to the Beaumont disappearance. =Alan Anthony Munro= In 2015 a man, Allan Maxwell McIntyre (died June 2017) ‚Äì who had himself been investigated by police and cleared of involvement in the Beaumont case ‚Äì gave a secondhand account to The Advertiser that a man he had known in 1966, who by 2015 was being sought in Southeast Asia in connection with child abuse incidents there, had come to his home with the children's bodies in the boot of his car. McIntyre's children said that they and their father initially mistook the body of Arnna Kathleen Beaumont for a boy because of her short hair. Arnna Beaumont had gone to Glenelg that day in a female bathing suit. The man in question was later identified as businessman Alan Anthony Munro (aged 75 in 2017), a former Scoutmaster who had pleaded guilty to 10 child sex offences dating back to 1962. For these crimes, he was sentenced to 10 years, with a non-parole period of five years and five months, making him eligible for release in 2022. In June 2017, Adelaide detectives were given a copy of a child's diary, written in 1966, which allegedly placed Munro in the vicinity of Glenelg Beach at the time of the children's disappearance. Munro was convicted of abusing several children, including a son of McIntyre, who was a contributor to the diary. Munro had been previously investigated by police but no evidence had been found that he was involved in the Beaumont case. = Harry Phipps = Harry Phipps (died 2004), a local factory owner and then-member of Adelaide's social elite, came to attention as a possible suspect after the publication of the book The Satin Man: Uncovering the Mystery of the Missing Beaumont Children in 2013. It was republished and updated with new information in 2015. The book did not name the identity of the Satin Man, but his estranged son identified him soon after as the Satin Man and possible murderer. Phipps bore a substantial likeness to the police artist's impression of the man seen talking to the children on the beach, was wealthy and known to be in the habit of giving out ¬£1 notes, was later alleged to have paedophile tendencies, and lived only 300 metres away from Glenelg Beach on the corner of Augusta Street and Sussex Street. In 2007, Phipps's son Haydn, who was 15 at the time of the disappearance, came forward to researchers with the claim that he had seen the children in his father's yard that day. Two other persons, youths at the time, said that they had been paid by Phipps to dig a 2 √ó 1 √ó 2-metre hole in his factory yard that weekend, for unstated reasons. In November 2013, a one-metre-squared section of a factory in North Plympton, which had been owned by Phipps, was excavated following the new information about his possible involvement in the disappearance of the children. A ground-penetrating radar found \\"one small anomaly, which can indicate movement or objects within the soil\\", but the dig found no additional evidence and investigations into the site were closed. On 22 January 2018, Adelaide detectives announced that they would return to the factory site and conduct further excavations, after a private investigation sponsored by Channel Seven Adelaide. The excavation, on 2 February 2018, took nine hours. Animal bones and general rubbish were found, but nothing related to the Beaumont case.  Possibly related cases  =Joanne Ratcliffe and Kirste Gordon= In 1973, two children, Joanne Ratcliffe (11) and Kirste Gordon (4), disappeared from the Adelaide Oval during a football match, and they are presumed to have been abducted and murdered. Ratcliffe's parents and Gordon's grandmother had allowed the girls to leave their group to go to the toilet. They were seen several times in the 90 minutes after leaving the Oval, apparently distressed and in the company of an unknown man, but they vanished after the last reported sighting. The police sketch of the suspect resembles that of the man last seen with the Beaumont children, but it is not a satisfactory identikit image.ABC Radio-Eye, 101 Degrees: The Beaumont Children Detectives believe the cases may be linked. =The Family Murders= In 1979, the body of a young man was found in Adelaide. He was identified as Neil Muir (25). His body was badly mutilated. In 1982, the mutilated body of Mark Langley (18) was found. Before his death, he had been subjected to \\"surgery\\" -- his abdomen had been sliced open, and had been shaved prior to this. Part of his bowel had been removed and Langley had died from loss of blood. Over the next few months more bodies were found. The dismembered skeletal remains of Peter Stogneff (14) were found almost a year after his disappearance and Alan Barnes (18) was found mutilated in a similar manner to Langley. A fifth victim, Richard Kelvin (15), was found in 1983, once again with the same mutilations. Bevan Spencer von Einem was convicted of Kelvin's murder in 1984 and was charged with the murders of Barnes and Langley in 1989. However, the prosecution was forced to enter a nolle prosequi (unwilling to pursue) when crucial evidence was deemed inadmissible. These crimes have been known collectively as the Family Murders; police believe that a core group of four people and up to eight associates were involved in the murders. Testimony given during von Einem's trial alleged he was involved in both the Beaumont children disappearance and the abduction of Ratcliffe and Gordon.  Legacy  The Beaumont case resulted in one of the largest police investigations in Australian criminal history and remains one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, even after many decades. In January 2018, the Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, said that South Australia Police had \\"never given up on the case\\" and that they \\"have a policy that no murder investigation ends up in a closed file\\". The State Government also continues to maintain a A$1 million reward for information relating to the children's disappearance. The kidnapping is also viewed by many social commentators as a significant event in the evolution of Australian society, with a large number of people changing the way they supervised their children daily. At the time, it was never publicly suggested that the children should not have been allowed to travel unsupervised, or that their parents were in any way negligent, simply because contemporary Australian society took it for granted that this was safe and acceptable. However, this case alongside similar child-related crimes (such as the 1960 Graeme Thorne kidnapping, and the 1965 Wanda Beach murders) \\"marked an end of innocence in [post-war] Australian life\\". The regular and widespread attention given to this case, its significance in Australian criminal history and the fact that the mystery of their disappearance has never been explained have led to the story being continually revisited by the media. New leads and clues are regularly reported by the media, and the case still regularly headlines print and broadcast media more than half a century on. = Parents = At the time of the investigation, the Beaumonts received widespread sympathy from the Australian public. They remained at their Somerton Park home, and Nancy Beaumont in particular held hope that the children would return and stated in interviews that it would be \\"dreadful\\" if the children returned home and did not find their parents waiting for them. Over the years, as new leads and new theories emerged, the Beaumonts co-operated fully in exploring every possibility, whether it was claims that the children had been abducted by a religious cult and were living variously in New Zealand, Melbourne, or Tasmania, or some clue that suggested a possible burial site for the children. They were devastated in 1990 when newspapers published computer- generated photographs of how the children would have looked as adults. The pictures, published against their wishes, caused a huge wave of public sympathy from a community which is still sensitive to their pain. The couple later divorced and lived separately, having resolved to live their final years away from the public attention that followed them for decades. They sold their home and, while the case remains open, the South Australian Police Force remains informed of the couple's addresses. They were reported to have accepted that the truth may never be discovered. Nancy Beaumont died in Adelaide on 16 September 2019, in a nursing home, aged 92, whereas Jim Beaumont, also aged in his 90s, continues to reside in Adelaide.  Media  The case attracted widespread police and media attention in Australia and beyond. The fact that the case has never been explained has led to the story being continually revisited by the media, and by newer online sites, more than 50 years after the children's disappearance.

The only child of the composer Gustav Holst, she is particularly known for her educational work at Dartington Hall in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival. In addition to composing music, she wrote composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father. From a young age, Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, she entered the Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer due to health reasons, Holst spent most of the 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity. In the early 1950s Holst became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Her own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there. Background =Early life and family= Barnes where the Holst family lived between 1908 and 1913 Imogen Holst was born on 12 April 1907 at 31 Grena Road, Richmond, a riverside town to the west of London. Her parents were Gustav Theodore Holst, an aspiring composer then working as a music teacher, and Isobel, n√©e Harrison. The Holst family, of mixed Swedish, German and Latvian ancestry, had been in England since 1802 and had been musicians for several generations. Gustav followed this family tradition; while studying at the Royal College of Music (RCM), he met Isobel Harrison, who sang in one of the amateur choirs that he conducted. He was immediately attracted to her, and they were married on 22 July 1901. While attempting to establish himself as a composer, Gustav Holst worked first as an orchestral trombonist, and later as a teacher. In 1907 he held teaching posts at James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich, and St Paul's Girls' School (SPGS) in Hammersmith, where he was director of music. From 1907 he acted as director of music at Morley College, an adult education centre in the Waterloo district of London. When Imogen was still very small the family moved from Richmond to a small house by the river in nearby Barnes, which they rented from a relative. Imogen's main memories of this house were of her father working in his composing room on the top floor, which she was forbidden to visit, and of his efforts to teach her folk-songs. =Schooling= Gustav Holst circa 1920, drawn by William Rothenstein Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916. In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions, and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with Andr√© Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions‚Äîtwo instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes‚Äîwhich she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July. Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park. In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the end of it\\". Imogen's SPGS years were generally happy and successful. In July 1923 she won the junior Alice Lupton piano prize, but her chances of distinction as a pianist were marred when she began to develop phlebitis in her left arm. Among other activities she became interested in folk music and dance, and in 1923 became a member of the English Folk Dance Society (EFDS). In 1924‚Äì25, her final year at SPGS, Imogen founded a folk dance society in the school. At an end-of-term school concert late in July 1925, she played Chopin's √©tude in E major and gave the first performance of Gustav Holst's Toccata. Royal College of Music The Royal College of Music Although destined like her father for the RCM, Holst first spent a year studying composition with Herbert Howells, piano with Adine O'Neill and the French horn with Adolph Borsdorf, while participating in the EFDS summer schools and other musical activities. In July 1926 she arranged and conducted the music for an EFDS pageant, held at Thaxted as a fund-raiser towards the building of the society's new headquarters at Regent's Park. Holst began at the RCM in September 1926, studying piano with Kathleen Long, composition with George Dyson, and conducting under W. H. Reed. Her aptitude as a conductor was evident in December 1926, when she led the college's Third Orchestra in the opening movement of Mozart's \\"Prague\\" Symphony. This and other performances on the podium led The Daily Telegraph to speculate that Holst might eventually become the first woman to \\"establish a secure tenure of the conductor's platform\\". In her second RCM year Holst concentrated on composition, producing several chamber works including a violin sonata, an oboe quintet, and a suite for woodwind. She took her first steps towards personal independence when she moved from the family home to a bedsit near Kensington Gardens. In 1928 she went to Belgium with the EFDS, took an Italian holiday, and made an extended trip to Germany with a group known as \\"The Travelling Morrice\\" which promoted international understanding through music and dance. In October 1928 she won the RCM's Cobbett prize for an original chamber composition, her Phantasy String Quartet, and shortly afterwards was awarded the Morley Scholarship for the \\"best all-round student\\". The quartet was broadcast by the BBC on 20 March 1929, but for her, the achievement was overshadowed by the news that month of the premature death at 34 of her early mentor Jane Joseph. In the winter of 1929 Holst made her first visit to Canada and the United States, as part of an EFDS party. Back home, she worked on her RCM finals composition, a suite for brass band entitled The Unfortunate Traveller. Despite some apprehension on her part, the piece passed the examiners' scrutiny and was played at the college's end-of-year concert in July 1930. Before then, in June, Holst learned that she had been awarded an Octavia Travelling Scholarship worth ¬£100, which would enable her to study composition abroad. Career =European travels, 1930‚Äì31= Holst spent much of the period between September 1930 and May 1931 travelling. A hectic visit to Li√®ge in September, for the International Society of Contemporary Music Congress, was followed immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary, returning to England via Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her musical experiences included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg, performances of Der Rosenkavalier and Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail at the Vienna State Opera, Bach in Berlin and Mahler's Seventh Symphony in Amsterdam. On 1 February 1932 she left England again, this time for Italy. After a two- month tour Holst came home with mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that \\"the Italians are a nation of singers ... But music is a different language in that part of the world\\". Back in London, she decided that despite her experiences, \\"if it is music one is wanting, there is no place like London.\\" =Mainly teaching, 1931‚Äì38= Cecil Sharp House, London headquarters of the English Folk Dance and Song Society With her scholarship funds exhausted, Holst needed a job, and in June 1931 took charge of music at the Citizen House arts and education centre in Bath. She disliked the disciplines imposed by an unsympathetic and unyielding superior, but stayed until the end of the year, by which time Citizen House had relocated to Hampstead. She worked briefly as a freelance conductor and accompanist before joining the staff of the EFDS early in 1932. The organisation had by now expanded to become the \\"English Folk Dance and Song Society\\" (EFDSS) and was based in new headquarters at Cecil Sharp House. The duties, mainly teaching, were not full-time, and she was able to take up part-time teaching posts at her old school, Eothen, and at Roedean School. Although she composed little original music during these years, she made many instrumental and vocal arrangements of traditional folk melodies. Gustav Holst's health had been poor for years; in the winter of 1933‚Äì34 it deteriorated, and he died on 25 May 1934. Imogen Holst privately determined that she would establish and protect her father's musical legacy. On 24 March 1935 she took part in a Gustav Holst memorial concert, in which she conducted her own arrangement of one of her father's brass band suites. Meanwhile, her own music was beginning to attract attention. Her carol arrangement \\"Nowell and Nowell\\" was performed in a 1934 Christmas concert in Chichester Cathedral, and the following year saw the premiere of her Concerto for Violin and Strings, with Elsie Avril as the soloist. In 1936 she paid a visit to Hollywood, where she stayed with her uncle (Gustav's brother), the actor Ernest Cossart. Back in England, Holst worked on recorder arrangements of music by the neglected 16th-century composer Pelham Humphrey. These were published in 1936 to a positive critical reception. In 1938 Holst published a biography of her father. Among many positive comments from friends and critics, the composer Edmund Rubbra praised her for producing a book that was not \\"clouded by sentiment ... her biography is at once intimate and objective\\".Edmund Rubbra in Monthly Musical Record, November 1938, quoted in Grogan and Strode Part II, p. 125 =War: travelling for CEMA= Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf by the Ballet Rambert) In 1938 Holst decided to abandon amateur music-making and teaching to concentrate on her own professional development. She resigned her EFDSS post while continuing to honour existing commitments to the organisation. She had given up her work at Roedean in 1936; at Easter 1939 she resigned from Eothen. In June 1939 she began a tour of Switzerland which included the Lucerne Festival. Towards the end of August, as war became increasingly likely, she broke off the trip and returned home. After the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, Holst worked for the Bloomsbury House Refugee Committee, which supported German and Austrian refugee musicians interned under emergency regulations. In January 1940 she accepted a position under a scheme organised by the Pilgrim Trust, to act as one of six \\"music travellers\\", whose brief was to boost morale by encouraging musical activities in rural communities. Holst was assigned to cover the west of England, a huge area stretching from Oxfordshire to Cornwall. When the government set up the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), responsibility for the music travellers passed to that body. With little practical support from CEMA, Holst's organisational talents, according to her friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, \\"developed brilliantly\\". According to Holst's own account, her duties included conducting local brass bands and Women's Institute choirs (\\"fourteen very old women in hats sitting round the edge of a dark, empty hideous tin hut\\"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged performances by professional groups, and what she termed \\"drop-in-and-sing\\" festivals in which anyone could join. She wrote of \\"idyllic days\\" spent over cups of tea, discussing the hopes and dreams of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios‚Äîthe Offley and Deddington suites‚Äîand made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs. =Dartington= The main hall at Dartington In 1938, Holst had visited Dartington Hall, a progressive school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, which had been founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. In 1941‚Äì42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942 she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, \\"the sort of thing that your father did in the old days at Morley College\\". Beginning in 1943, Holst established a one-year course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Holst's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: \\"Hardly any of us could play ... However bad we were, we went on\\". Holst's teaching methods, heavily based on \\"learning by doing\\" and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Holst at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: \\"She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before ... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank\\".Rosamond Strode, in an unpublished typescript, quoted in Grogan and Strode Part II, pp. 154‚Äì55 In the conducive atmosphere of Dartington Holst resumed serious composition, largely abandoned during the hectic CEMA years. In 1943 she completed a Serenade for flute, viola and bassoon, a Suite for String Orchestra, and a choral work, Three Psalms. All these works were performed at a Wigmore Hall concert on 14 June 1943 devoted to her music. Other compositions from the Dartington years included Theme and Variations for solo violin, String Trio No. 1 (premiered by the Dartington Hall String Trio at the National Gallery on 17 July 1944), songs from the 16th-century anthology Tottel's Miscellany, an oboe concerto, and a string quartet. In October 1943 the composer Benjamin Britten and the tenor Peter Pears gave the first of several recitals at Dartington. A mutual respect and friendship developed between Britten and Holst, strengthened by their shared love of neglected music from the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Holst was convinced that Britten was the composer to continue and complete the work of her father in redefining the character of English music. From 1945, while maintaining her commitment to Dartington, Holst began to widen her musical activities. As well as editing and preparing scores for Britten, she promoted Dartington as the base for Britten's new English Opera Group, although eventually Glyndebourne was preferred. In 1947 she encouraged the refugee violinist Norbert Brainin to form his own string quartet, and arranged its debut at Dartington, as the \\"Brainin Quartet\\", on 13 July 1947. Six months later, renamed the Amadeus Quartet, the group appeared at the Wigmore Hall, and went on to worldwide recognition. In 1948 she began work on a critical study of her father's music, a companion volume to her 1938 Gustav Holst biography. When this was published in 1951, most critics praised its objectivity, one critic venturing that she had been \\"unnecessarily harsh\\" in her judgements. Rising standards of achievement at Dartington enabled Holst to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute from one of the audience: \\"I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus\\". By the middle of 1950 Holst's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival; The work was the song cycle for female voices and harp, Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow. Sensing that it was time to leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure. =Aldeburgh= Without definite plans for her future after Dartington, Holst toured Europe, collecting music that she would later edit for performance, including madrigals by Carlo Gesualdo which she found \\"very exciting\\". At home, although not formally employed by Britten, she worked with him on several projects, including a new performing version of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, and the preparation of the vocal and full scores for Britten's opera Billy Budd. Pears, who had observed Holst's overall contributions to musical life at Dartington, believed she could help Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival on a more formal basis, and shortly after the 1952 festival Britten invited her to come and work with him. She agreed, and moved to lodgings in Aldeburgh. Assistant to Britten Benjamin Britten, photographed in the mid-1960s When Holst joined Britten, the financial arrangement was vague; Britten paid her on a piecemeal basis rather than a regular salary, unaware that she had made over her rights to her father's estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own physical comfort. For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Alongside this work, she made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father's music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes. For the first 18 months of her association with Britten, Holst kept a diary which, Grogan says, forms a record of her \\"unconditional belief in Britten's achievement and status, and her absolute devotion to his work\\". The first of Britten's works to which she made a significant contribution was the opera Gloriana, scheduled to form part of the 1953 Coronation celebrations. The short timescale for the writing of the opera placed considerable pressure on the composer and his new assistant, strains that were dramatised 60 years later in a radio play, Imo and Ben. Holst's main task with Gloriana was to copy Britten's pencil sketches and prepare the vocal and piano scores which the singers needed for rehearsals by February 1953. Later she assisted him with the writing of the full orchestral score, and performed similar services with his next opera, The Turn of the Screw (1954). When Britten was under pressure during the composition of his ballet The Prince of the Pagodas (1956), Holst accompanied him to Switzerland, to remain by his side as he completed the work. She took great pleasure in her association with Britten's opera for children, Noye's Fludde (1957), for which she showed Britten how to achieve a unique raindrop effect by hitting a row of china mugs with a wooden spoon. She and Britten combined to collect and publish music for the recorder, in a series published by Boosey and Hawkes (1954‚Äì59), and jointly wrote a popular introductory book, The Story of Music (1958). Holst continued to assist Britten with all his major compositions until 1964, at that point she determined to give priority to the final securing of her father's musical legacy, to re-establish her career as a composer, and to pursue a more independent path. She relinquished her post as Britten's assistant, while remaining personally devoted to Britten. She did not leave Aldeburgh, and continued her work with the annual Aldeburgh Festival. Artistic director In 1956 Holst's role in the Aldeburgh Festival was formalised when she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. For the 1956 festival she scheduled a performance of Gustav Holst's opera Savitri, the first of several Gustav Holst works that she introduced to the festival in the ensuing years. Savitri was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of John Blow's 17th century opera Venus and Adonis. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts, and in 1962 she organised a series devoted to Flemish music, in which she had recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes of church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Holst had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house was built on the edge of the site where it had been hoped to build a Festival Theatre. When that plan was abandoned in favour of a move to Snape Maltings, the bungalow was built anyway by the architect H. T. Cadbury-Brown, who allowed Holst to live there rent- free. In 1964 Holst began composing again, and in 1965 accepted commissions for two large-scale works: The Sun's Journey, a cantata for female voices, and the Trianon Suite, composed for the Trianon Youth Orchestra of Ipswich. In 1965 and 1966 she published two books, studies of Bach and Britten. The latter work caused some shock and surprise by failing to mention the contributions to Britten's successes of several key figures in Britten's earlier career who had subsequently fallen out of favour, such as his former librettists Eric Crozier and Ronald Duncan. Between 1966 and 1970 Holst recorded a number of her father's works with the Purcell Singers and the English Chamber Orchestra, under the Argo and Lyrita labels. (Items 1383, 1395, 1419, 1518 and 1688) Among these recordings was the Double Violin Concerto, which she conducted with Emanuel Hurwitz as soloist. Forty years earlier she had acted as the rehearsal pianist before the work's first performance. The concert hall at Snape Maltings, home of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1967 Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Sch√ºtz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Sch√ºtz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess. On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\". Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival. She made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor Andr√© Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus. Later career Gustav Holst's centenary was celebrated in 1974, when Imogen published a Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst's Music and founded the Holst Birthplace Museum in Cheltenham. The centenary was the occasion for the publication of the first volume of a facsimile edition of Gustav Holst's manuscripts, on which Imogen worked with the help of the composer Colin Matthews. Three more facsimile volumes followed in the years up to 1983, at which point the increasing costs, and Imogen's failing health led to the abandonment of the project. As part of the 1974 centenary, she negotiated performances of Savitri and The Wandering Scholar at Aldeburgh and Sadler's Wells, and helped to arrange exhibitions of Gustav Holst's life and works at Aldeburgh and the Royal Festival Hall. Apart from her books concerned with her father's life and works, Holst continued to write on other aspects of music. In addition to numerous articles she published a short study of the Renaissance composer William Byrd (1972) and a handbook for conductors of amateur choirs (1973). She continued to compose, usually short pieces but with occasional larger-scale orchestral works such as the Woodbridge Suite (1970) and the Deben Calendar (1977), the latter a series of twelve sketches depicting the River Deben in Suffolk at different phases of the year. Her last major composition was a String Quintet, written in 1982 and performed in October of that year by the Endellion Quartet, augmented by the cellist Steven Isserlis. In 1976, she took legal action over a recording by Japanese electronic composer Isao Tomita of 'The Planets', calling it 'unworthy of my father's creation'. The record, originally issued on the RCA label, was withdrawn from sale, and vinyl copies have subsequently become very rare. In April 1979 Holst was present when the Queen Mother opened the new Britten‚ÄìPears School building in Snape. The building included a new library‚Äîthe Gustav Holst Library‚Äîto which Holst had donated a large amount of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career. She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.  Death  Shortly after the 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Holst became seriously ill with what she described as \\"a coronary angina\\". Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. However, by early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot a few yards away frompersonal observation Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she \\"[brought] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder\\". Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: \\"Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her ... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain what most of us need twice that time to do\\". In 2007, Holst's centenary was recognised at Aldeburgh by several special events, including a recital in the parish church by the Navarra Quartet in which works by Purcell and Schubert were mixed with Imogen's own The Fall of the Leaf for solo cello, and the String Quintet. The latter work was described by Andrew Clements in The Guardian as \\"genuinely memorable ... The set of variations with which the quintet ends dissolves into a series of bare solo lines, linking Holst's music to her father's\\". Holst never married, though she enjoyed a number of romantic friendships, notably with the future poet Miles Tomalin, whom she met when she was a pupil at St Paul's. The two were close until 1929, and exchanged poetry; Tomalin married in 1931. Many years after the relationship ended, Holst admitted to Britten that she would have married Tomalin. =Honours= Holst was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1966. She was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex (1968), Exeter (1969), and Leeds (1983). She was given honorary membership of the Royal Academy of Music in 1970. Holst was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1975 New Year Honours for services to music. Music Imogen Holst was a part-time composer, intermittently productive within her extensive portfolio of musical activities. In her earlier years she was among a group of young British women composers‚ÄîElizabeth Maconchy and Elisabeth Lutyens were others‚Äîwhose music was regularly performed and broadcast. According to a later critic, her Mass in A minor of 1927 showed \\"confident and imaginative layering of voices, building to a satisfying Agnus Dei\\". However, for long periods in her subsequent career Holst barely composed at all. After the RCM, her most active years as a composer were at Dartington in the 1940s and the \\"post-Britten\\" period after 1964. Her output of compositions, arrangements and edited music is extensive but has received only limited critical attention. Much of it is unpublished and has usually been neglected after its initial performance. The oeuvre comprises instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Holst was primarily influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter, by what the analyst Christopher Tinker terms \\"her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment\\", by her close personal relationship with her father, and her love of folksong. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style that emerged in the 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the Five Songs (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in Hallo My Fancy (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In Homage to William Morris (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of dissonance \\"to add strength to the musical articulation of the text\\".Tinker, p. 443 By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Holst herself thought made her \\"a real composer\\", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies. Much of Holst's choral music was written for amateur performance. Critics have observed a clear distinction in quality between these pieces and the choral works written for professional choirs, particularly those for women's voices. These latter pieces, says Tinker, incorporate her best work as an original composer. Record companies were slow in recognising her commercial potential, and not until 2009 was a CD issued devoted entirely to her music‚Äîa selection of her works for strings. The Guardians reviewer welcomed the recording: \\"[T]here is a great deal of English music of far less worth that is frequently praised to the skies\\". In 2012 a selection of her choral music, sung by the Clare College Choir, was recorded by Harmonia Mundi. One review of this recording picks out Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow, written for female voices with harp accompaniment, as \\"[giving] an insight into her own, softly nuanced, pioneering voice\\". Another mentions the \\"Three Psalms\\" setting, where \\"inner rhythms are underscored by the subtle string ostinatos pulsing beneath\\".

History The two antecedent regiments were formed in 1829 following the withdrawal of the regiments of Swiss mercenaries from Dutch service. Willem I ordered that two regiments would be formed to replace the Swiss, to serve as his guards. Both served with distinction, especially during the Second World War in the defence of The Hague. The regiment was formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of two antecedent regiments, the Garderegiment Grenadiers and the Garderegiment Jagers. Organization The regiment's single battalion currently serves in the airmobile role as part of 11 Luchtmobiele (Airmobile) Brigade. It is organised with an HQ Company (Stafcompagnie), a heavy weapons company (Zwarewapenscompagnie) and three infantry companies (Infanteriecompagnie). The three infantry companies and the anti-tank company perpetuate the two antecedent regiments, with 'A' (Koningscompagnie) and 'D' (Wolvencompagnie) companies being classed as Grenadiers and 'B' (Stiercompagnie) and 'C' (Tijgercompagnie) Companies being classed as Jagers (Rifles). The regiment has a museum in Arnhem.https://www.verenigingveteranengrenadiersenjagers.nl/Museum Bands Serving the Guards in musical support, given the few numbers of military bands in service, are the Royal Military Band \\"Johan Willem Friso\\" and the Traditional Grenadier Bugle Band of the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment (Grenadiers) and the Veterans Fanfare band and Bugles and Fanfare orchestra of the Grenadiers and Rifles (Rifles). These are the only bands in service in the Guards units of the RNA as the Band and Corps of Drums of the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene remain disbanded. The present day fanfare brass band (known as the Regimentsfanfare) consists of 21 musicians and a permanent conductor. It has existed since 5 September 2005.

The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin secondary to platelet disorders, vascular disorders, coagulation disorders, or other causes. They measure 3‚Äì10 mm, whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm. Purpura is common with typhus and can be present with meningitis caused by meningococci or septicaemia. In particular, meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis), a Gram-negative diplococcus organism, releases endotoxin when it lyses. Endotoxin activates the Hageman factor (clotting factor XII), which causes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The DIC is what appears as a rash on the affected individual. Classification Purpura are a common and nonspecific medical sign; however, the underlying mechanism commonly involves one of: *Platelet disorders (thrombocytopenic purpura) **Primary thrombocytopenic purpura **Secondary thrombocytopenic purpura **Post-transfusion purpura *Vascular disorders (nonthrombocytopenic purpura) **Microvascular injury, as seen in senile (old age) purpura, when blood vessels are more easily damaged **Hypertensive states **Deficient vascular support **Vasculitis, as in the case of Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura *Coagulation disorders **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) **Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) ‚Äì defect in collagen synthesis due to lack of hydroxylation of procollagen results in weakened capillary walls and cells *Meningococcemia *Clumping fibrillary protein deposits caused by Amyloidosis *Cocaine use with concomitant use of the one-time chemotherapy drug and now veterinary deworming agent levamisole can cause purpura of the ears, face, trunk, or extremities, sometimes needing reconstructive surgery. Levamisole is purportedly a common cutting agent. *Decomposition of blood vessels including purpura is a symptom of acute radiation poisoning in excess of 2 Grays of radiation exposure. This is an uncommon cause in general, but is commonly seen in victims of nuclear disaster. Cases of psychogenic purpura are also described in the medical literature, some claimed to be due to \\"autoerythrocyte sensitization\\". Other studies suggest the local (cutaneous) activity of tissue plasminogen activator can be increased in psychogenic purpura, leading to substantial amounts of localized plasmin activity, rapid degradation of fibrin clots, and resultant bleeding. Petechial rash is also characteristic of a rickettsial infection. Etymology and pronunciation The word purpura () comes from Latin purpura, \\"purple\\", which came from ancient Greek œÄŒøœÅœÜœçœÅŒ±. Purpura is a mass noun naming the condition or state, not the name of an individual spot (thus there is no *pupurum, *purpura or *purpura, *purpurae count declension).

Despite this, petechiae are used by police investigators in determining whether strangulation has been part of an attack. The documentation of the presence of petechiae on a victim can help police investigators prove the case. Petechiae resulting from strangulation can be relatively tiny and light in color to very bright and pronounced. Petechiae may be seen on the face, in the whites of the eyes or on the inside of the eyelids.

The second Pete looked very similar to the first Pete but was a mirror image; the circle around first Pete's right eye was around the left eye of his son, the second Pete. The second Pete appeared as a puppy on Pups Is Pups and was nearly full-grown on his second appearance, School's Out. The second Pete's last Our Gang appearance was The Pooch in 1932. The plot had a dog catcher who attempts to catch Pete and euthanise him, but is unsuccessful. After Lucenay was fired from the Our Gang series in 1932, he retired Peter to Atlantic City, where he was photographed with children at the Steel Pier. Beginning with Hook and Ladder (filmed the same year), an unrelated dog played Pete, after which, various unrelated dogs would play the role through 1938. A parody of Pete appeared briefly in the 1935 Bob Hope short Watch the Birdie, which was produced by Warner Bros. In the 1982 cartoon series produced by Hanna-Barbera, he was voiced by Peter Cullen. In the 1994 feature film remake of The Little Rascals, Pete is an American Bulldog, and in the 2014 movie The Little Rascals Save the Day, Pete is a mutt.

He is recognized as one of the originators of the twentieth-century religious movements in Greece. He is also noted for his prophesies. Saint Cosmas, the \\"Equal to the Apostles,\\" was officially proclaimed a Saint by the Orthodox Church of Constantinople on 20 April 1961 under the tenure of Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras. His feast day is celebrated on 24 August, the date of his martyrdom. Icon of St. Cosmas of Aetolia Life Cosmas was born in the Greek village of Mega Dendron near the town of Thermo in the region of Aetolia.\\"Saint Cosmas of Aetolia, Equal to the Apostles\\", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America He studied Greek and theology before becoming a monk after a trip to Mount Athos, where he also attended the local Theological Academy. After two years Cosmas left Athos. He studied rhetoric in Constantinople for a time. In 1760 he was authorized by Patriarch Serapheim II (who had marked anti-Ottoman tendencies) to begin missionary tours in the villages of Thrace ‚Äì later extended to what would form the areas of both West Greece and Northern Greece. The Patriarch had reportedly been worried at the increasing rate of Christians converting to Islam in these areas. Over sixteen years, Cosmas established many church schools in villages and towns.\\"Repose of the New-Hieromartyr Cosmas of Aitolia, Equal of the Apostles\\", Orthodox Church in America He called upon Christians to establish schools and learn Biblical Koine Greek, so that they might understand the Scriptures better and generally educate themselves. After the Orlov Revolt of 1770 in the Peloponnese (which was provoked by the Orlov brothers with the support of Catherine II of the Russian Empire), Cosmas started to preach in what is now Southern Albania, then under the rule of Ahmet Kurt Pasha, governor of the Pashalik of Berat. His preachings had aroused the opposition of the rich and powerful and others who felt their position threatened, such as the kotsampasides (Greek \\"village elders\\" whose power and influence was bound up with Ottoman power).Tassos A. Mikropoulos, \\"The Muslim Presence in Epirus and Western Greece\\", Cosmas was also viewed with suspicion by officials of the Venetian Republic, then in its final stages of decline, which ruled parts of the territory where he was active. For example, in 1779 he is said to have visited the Venetian-ruled town of Preveza and founded there a Greek school, which would be the only school of the city during the 18th century ‚Äì an act which the Venetian authorities might have considered as undermining their rule.Sakellariou M.V.:\\"Epirus, 4,000 years of Greek history and civilisation\\", Ekdotikƒì Athƒìn≈çn, 1997, , p. 306 The Venetians' suspicions are attested in spy reports about Cosmas preserved in the Venetian archives. In contrast, Cosmas had considerable support from other Christians and even from some Turks. In his sermons Cosmas often refers negatively to the Jews. Nevertheless, in one of his preachings he stated specifically that: \\"Those who wrong Christians, Jews or Turks would be paid back for the injustice they committed\\". One effect of his preaching was to transfer the holding of the weekly bazaar (fair) from Sunday to Saturday, which brought economic losses to Jews ‚Äì barred by their religion from engaging in business on Sabbath. Some researchers believe that for that reason, Jews in Epirus were involved in his conviction by the Ottoman authorities. Accused of being a Russian agent, he was seized by Ottoman authorities. On 24 August 1779, he was executed at Kolkondas, Fier District, near the mouth of the Seman river (in present-day Albania). There were no formal charges brought against him, nor was he put on trial before being executed ‚Äì leading to various theories, persisting up to the present, about who might have wanted him dead. Legacy In 1813 Ali Pasha, the de facto independent Muslim Albanian ruler of Ottoman Epirus, southern Albanian and Macedonia, and an enemy of the Sultan, had a church built near the site of Cosmas' execution, in which the remains of Cosmas were placed. \\"Other relics of Saint Cosmas are kept in a special shrine at the main Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens, where some Northern Epirotes come to pray for the annexation of southern Albania by Greece. Though a purveyor of Hellenic culture, Cosmas Aitolos is still highly regarded among Orthodox Albanians in Albania and in the United States for the profound spiritual message and encouragement he gave.\\" Ali Pasha went as far as having a date of celebration set in Cosmas' honor. Some other Muslims disliked Ali Pasha's \\"giving too much honor to a giaouri\\", to which the Pasha reportedly replied: \\"Bring me a Muslim like him, I would kiss his feet.\\". From different French and English writers of his time he was known as a friend and a sustain for Father Cosmas. In 1984 the remains were transferred from the St. Cosmas' Monastery in Kolkondas, where he was killed, to the Archaeological Museum of Fier. Other relics of the saint are kept in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. Saint Kosmas' pilgrimage is also revered in some Greek nationalist circles. The latter are associated with the Northern Epirus issue and support the annexation of this region to Greece. \\"Other relics of Saint Cosmas are kept in a special shrine at the main Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens, where some Northern Epirotes come to pray for the annexation of southern Albania by Greece.

There are numerous popular religious texts attributed to St. Cosmas. Best known are the five \\"Didaches\\" and the \\"Prophecies\\". An account stated that he prophesied the unification of Greece and Epirus. There survives, however, no original manuscript of these texts written personally by St. Cosmas, and none can be dated with certainty.

It is believed that these texts are based on Cosmas' preachings but were written and copied mostly after his death.

The pulp is a part of the dentin‚Äìpulp complex (endodontium). The vitality of the dentin-pulp complex, both during health and after injury, depends on pulp cell activity and the signaling processes that regulate the cell's behavior.  Anatomy  The pulp is the neurovascular bundle central to each tooth, permanent or primary. It comprises a central pulp chamber, pulp horns, and radicular canals. The large mass of pulp is contained within the pulp chamber, which is contained in and mimics the overall shape of the crown of the tooth.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 164. Because of the continuous deposition of dentine, the pulp chamber becomes smaller with age. This is not uniform throughout the coronal pulp but progresses faster on the floor than on the roof or side walls. Radicular pulp canals extend down from the cervical region of the crown to the root apex. They are not always straight but vary in shape, size, and number. They are continuous with the periapical tissues through the apical foramen or foramina. The total volumes of all the permanent teeth organs is 0.38cc and the mean volume of a single adult human pulp is 0.02cc. Accessory canals are pathways from the radicular pulp, extending laterally through the dentin to the periodontal tissue seen especially in the apical third of the root. Accessory canals are also called lateral canals because they are usually located on the lateral surface of the roots of the teeth.  Development  The pulp has a background similar to that of dentin, because both are derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ. During odontogenesis, when the dentin forms around the dental papilla, the innermost tissue is considered pulp. SDEO: Dental pulp of a stained and decalcified tooth. There are 4 main stages of tooth development: 1.Bud stage 2.Cap stage 3.Bell stage 4.Crown stage The first signs of tooth development are known to be as early as 6th week of intrauterine life. The oral epithelium begins to multiply and invaginates into ectomesenchyme cells which gives rise to dental lamina. The dental lamina is the origin of tooth bud. The bud stage progresses onto cap stage when the epithelium forms the enamel organ. The ectomesenchyme cells condenses further and becomes dental papilla. Together, the epithelial enamel organ and ectomesenchymal dental papilla and follicle form the tooth germ. The dental papilla is the origin of dental pulp. Cells at the periphery of the dental papilla undergo cell division and differentiation to becomes odontoblasts. Pulpoblasts forms in the middle of the pulp. This completes the formation of the pulp. The dental pulp is essentially a mature dental papilla. The development of dental pulp can also be split into two stages: The coronal pulp development (near the crown of tooth) and root pulp development (apex of tooth). The pulp develops 4 regions from the periphery to the central pulp: # Odontoblast layer # Cell free zone ‚Äì likely to be an artefact # Cell rich zone # Pulp core  Internal structure  Pulpal dentin junction. 1)outside tooth/enamel 2)dentin tubule 3)dentin 4)odontoblastic process 5)predentin 6)odontoblast 7)capillaries 8)fibroblasts 9)nerve 10)artery/vein 11)cell-rich zone 12)cell-poor zone 13)pulp chamber The central region of the coronal and radicular pulp contains large nerve trunks and blood vessels. This area is lined peripherally by a specialized odontogenic area which has four layers (from innermost to outermost): #Pulpal core, which is in the center of the pulp chamber with many cells and an extensive vascular supply; except for its location, it is very similar to the cell-rich zone. # Cell rich zone; which contains fibroblasts and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. #Cell free zone (zone of Weil) which is rich in both capillaries and nerve networks. #Odontoblastic layer; outermost layer which contains odontoblasts and lies next to the predentin and mature dentin. Cells found in the dental pulp include fibroblasts (the principal cell), odontoblasts, defence cells like histiocytes, macrophage, granulocytes, mast cells and plasma cells.The nerve plexus of Raschkow is located central to the cell-rich zone.Antonio Nanci, Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Elsevier, 2007, page 91 =The plexus of Raschkow= The plexus of Raschkow monitors painful sensations. By virtue of their peptide content they also play important functions in inflammatory events and subsequent tissue repair. There are two types of nerve fiber that mediate the sensation of pain: A-fibers conduct rapid and sharp pain sensations and belong to the myelinated group, whereas C-fibers are involved in dull aching pain and are thinner and unmyelinated. The A-fibers, mainly of the A-delta type, are preferentially located in the periphery of the pulp, where they are in close association with the odontoblasts and extend fibers to many but not all dentinal tubules. The C-fibers typically terminate in the pulp tissue proper, either as free nerve endings or as branches around blood vessels. Sensory nerve fibers that originate from inferior and superior alveolar nerves innervate the odontoblastic layer of the pulp cavity. These nerves enter the tooth through the apical foramen as myelinated nerve bundles. They branch to form the subodontoblastic nerve plexus of Raschkow which is separated from the odontoblasts by a cell-free zone of Weil, therefore this plexus lies between the cell free and cell rich zones of the pulp. Legend: 1 - Odontoblast layer; 2 - Cell-free zone of Weil; 3 - Cell-rich zone; 4 - Pulp core = Pulp Innervation = As the dental pulp is a highly vascularised and innervated region of the tooth, it is the site of origin for most pain-related sensations. The dental pulp nerve is innervated by one of the Trigeminal nerves, otherwise known as the fifth cranial nerve. The neurons enter the pulp cavity through the apical foramen, and branch off to form the nerve plexus of Raschkow (as mentioned earlier). Nerves from the plexus of Rasckow give branches to form a marginal plexus around the odontoblasts, with some nerves penetrating the dentinal tubules. The dental pulp is also innervated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These sympathetic axons projects into the radicular pulp, where they form a plexus along the blood vessels. Their function is mainly related to the blood vessel constriction within the dental pulp. Hence, a sharp fall in pulpal blood flow maybe very possibly be caused by a stimulation of these nerves.There is no evidence for a parasympathetic pulpal innervation. There are 2 main types of sensory nerve fibres in the pulp, each densely located at different locations. Moreover, the differing structural features of the 2 sensory nerve fibres also results in the different types of sensory stimulation. * Myelinated A-Fibres: ** The A-Fibres present in the pulp can be further classified into 2 different types, the A-delta Fibres which makes up 90% of the A-Fibres, while the rest are A-Beta Fibres. ** A relatively low-threshold sensory apparatus. ** Mainly located at pulp-dentine border at the top of the pulp, and more specifically concentrated in the pulp horn. ** It has a relatively small diameter, hence has a relatively slow conduction velocity. However, it is still faster than C-Fibres. ** A-Fibres transmit signals to the brainstem are then to the contralateral thalamus. ** Able to respond to stimuli through a shell of calcified tissue due to the stimulus-induced fluid flow in dentinal tubules. This is known as the hydrodynamic theory. Stimuli that displaces the fluid within the dentinal tubules will trigger the intradental myelinated A-Fibres, leading to a sharp pain sensation, commonly associated with dentine hypersensitivity * Unmyelinated C-Fibres: ** They are mainly located at the core of the pulp, and extends into underneath the odontoblastic layer. ** On the contrary, C-Fibres have higher thresholds, responsible for detecting inflammatory threats. ** Since it is heavily influenced by modulating interneurons before it reaches the thalamus, hence C-Fibre stimulation often results in a ‚Äúslow pain‚Äù, often characterised as a dull and aching pain. Functions The primary function of the dental pulp is to form dentin (by the odontoblasts). Other functions include: * Nutritive: the pulp keeps the organic components of the surrounding mineralized tissue supplied with moisture and nutrients; * Protective/Sensory: extremes in temperature, pressure, or trauma to the dentin or pulp are perceived as pain; * Defensive/reparative : the formation of reparative or tertiary dentin (by the odontoblasts); * Formative: cells of the pulp produce dentin which surrounds and protects the pulpal tissue.  Pulp Testing  see Dental pulp test The health of the dental pulp can be established by a variety of diagnostic aids which test either the blood supply to a tooth (Vitality Test) or the sensory response of the nerves within the root canal to specific stimuli (Sensitivity Test). Although less accurate, Sensitivity tests, such as Electric Pulp Tests or Thermal Tests, are more routinely used in clinical practice than vitality testing which require specialised equipment. A healthy tooth is expected to respond to sensitivity testing with a short, sharp burst of pain which subsides when the stimulus is removed. An exaggerated or prolonged response to sensitivity testing indicates that the tooth has some degree of symptomatic pulpitis. A tooth which does not respond at all to sensitivity testing may have become necrotic.  Pulpal Diagnoses  = Normal Pulp = In a healthy tooth pulp, the pulp is well-protected from infection by the enamel and dentin layers. A healthy normal pulp: -is vital and normally responsive to pulp testing -is symptoms and inflammation free -has a mild or transient response clinically to thermal and cold testing which should last no more than 1‚Äì2 seconds after stimulus is removed = Reversible Pulpitis = A mild to moderate inflammation of dental pulp caused by any momentary irritation or stimulant whereby no pain is felt upon removal of stimulants. The pulp swells when the protective layers of enamel and dentine are compromised. Unlike irreversible pulpitis, the pulp still gives a regular response to sensibility tests and inflammation resolves with management of the cause. There is no significant radiographic changes in the periapical region hence further examination is mandatory to ensure that the dental pulp has returned to its normal healthy state.  Common Causes  \\\\- Bacterial infection from caries \\\\- Thermal shock \\\\- Trauma \\\\- Excessive dehydration of a cavity during restoration \\\\- Irritation of exposed dentine \\\\- Repetitive trauma caused by bruxism (tooth grinding) or jaw misalignment \\\\- Fractured tooth exposing pulp  Symptoms  \\\\- Temporary post-restoration sensitivity \\\\- Pain is non- spontaneous and is milder compared to irreversible pulpitis \\\\- Short sharp pain due to a stimulant  How it is diagnosed \\\\- X-rays to determine extent of tooth decay and inflammation \\\\- Sensitivity tests to see if pain or discomfort is experienced when tooth is in contact with hot, cold or sweet stimuli \\\\- Tooth tap test (lightweight, blunt instrument gently tapped onto affected tooth to determine extent of inflammation) \\\\- Electric pulp test  Treatment  \\\\- Treatment aetiology should resolve reversible pulpitis; treating it early may help prevent irreversible pulpitis \\\\- Follow-up after treatment required to determine whether the reversible pulpitis has returned to a normal status  Prevention  \\\\- Regular check-ups for carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic caries \\\\- When preparing cavities, dehydrate with adequate amount of alcohol or chloroform and apply enough varnish to protect the pulp = Irreversible Pulpitis = Pulpitis is established when the pulp chamber is compromised by bacterial infection. Irreversible pulpitis is diagnosed when the pulp of the tooth is inflamed and infected beyond the point of no return, healing of the pulp is not possible. Removal of the aetiological agent will not permit healing and often root canal treatment is indicated. Irreversible pulpitis is commonly a sequel to reversible pulpitis when early intervention is not taken. It is key to note that in this stage of the disease progression, the pulp is still vital and vascularised; it is not classified as ‚Äòdead pulp‚Äô until necrosis occurs. Irreversible and reversible pulpitis are differentiated from each other based on the various pain responses that they have to thermal stimulation. If the condition is reversible then the pulp's pain response will last momentarily upon exposure to cold or hot substances; a few seconds. However, if the pain lingers from minutes to hours, then the condition is irreversible. This is a common presenting complaint that facilitates diagnoses before further investigations e.g. sensibility tests and peri-apical radiographs are proceeded. Diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis is branched into two sub-divisions: symptomatic and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis is a transition of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis into an inactive and quiescent state. This is due to the nature of its causation; the inflammatory exudate can be quickly removed e.g. through a large carious cavity or previous trauma that caused painless exposure of pulp. It is the build-up of pressure in a confined pulp space that stimulates nerve fibres and initiates pain reflexes. When this pressure is relieved, pain is not experienced. As the names imply, these diseases are largely characterised by the symptoms they present, duration and location of pain, causing and relieving factors. A clinician's role is to gather all this information systematically. This will be a compilation of clinical tests (cold ethyl chloride, EPT, hot gutta percha, palpation), radiographic analysis (peri- apical and/or cone beam computed tomography) and any further tests deemed necessary. Thermal tests are subjective by nature, so performed on not only the compromised tooth, but the adjacent and contra-lateral teeth as well, allowing the patient to compare information and give the clinician more accurate responses. Normal healthy teeth are used as a baseline for diagnoses. The following are key characteristics of each pathology: Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis: \\\\- Very spontaneous and unpredictable pain. Can occur at any time of day and specific causing factors cannot be labelled. \\\\- Patient may complain of sharp lingering pains, that last longer than 30 seconds even after removal of stimulus. \\\\- There may be referred pain \\\\- Pain may be more pronounced after changes of posture e.g. from lying down to standing up \\\\- Analgesics tend to be ineffective \\\\- As the bacteria have not yet progressed to the peri-apical region, there is no pain on percussion. Asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis \\\\- There are no clinical symptoms \\\\- Pulp will respond to sensibility tests as a healthy pulp would Treatments: Require endodontic (root canal) treatment or tooth extraction. In endodontic therapy, removal of the inflamed pulp relieves the pain. The empty root canal system is then obturated with Gutta-Percha which is a rubber material that acts as a pressure and pain reliever. Complications Pulp acts as a security and alarm system for a tooth. Slight decay in tooth structure not extending to the dentin may not alarm the pulp but as the dentin gets exposed, either due to dental caries or trauma, sensitivity starts. The dentinal tubules pass the stimulus to odontoblastic layer of the pulp which in turns triggers the response. This mainly responds to cold. At this stage simple restorations can be performed for treatment. As the decay progresses near the pulp the response also magnifies and sensation to a hot diet as well as cold gets louder. At this stage indirect pulp capping might work for treatment but at times it is impossible to clinically diagnose the extent of decay, pulpitis may elicit at this stage. Carious dentin by dental decay progressing to pulp may get fractured during mastication (chewing food) causing direct trauma to the pulp hence eliciting pulpitis. The inflammation of the pulp is known as pulpitis. Pulpitis can be extremely painful and in serious cases calls for root canal therapy or endodontic therapy. Traumatized pulp starts an inflammatory response but due to the hard and closed surroundings of the pulp pressure builds inside the pulp chamber compressing the nerve fibres and eliciting extreme pain (acute pulpitis). At this stage the death of the pulp starts which eventually progresses to periapical abscess formation (chronic pulpitis). The pulp horns recede with age. Also with increased age, the pulp undergoes a decrease in intercellular substance, water, and cells as it fills with an increased amount of collagen fibers. This decrease in cells is especially evident in the reduced number of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Thus, the pulp becomes more fibrotic with increased age, leading to a reduction in the regenerative capacity of the pulp due its loss of these cells. Also, the overall pulp cavity may be smaller by the addition of secondary or tertiary dentin, thus causing pulp recession. The lack of sensitivity associated with older teeth is due to receded pulp horns, pulp fibrosis, addition of dentin, or possibly all these age-related changes; many times restorative treatment can be performed without local anesthesia on older dentitions. = Pulp Necrosis = Pulp necrosis describes when the pulp of a tooth has become necrotic. The pulp tissue is either dead or dying, this may be for a number of reasons including: untreated caries, trauma or bacterial infection. It is often subsequent to chronic pulpitis. Teeth with pulp necrosis will need to undergo root canal treatment or extraction to prevent further spread of infection which may lead to an abscess.  Symptoms  Pulp necrosis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic for the patient. If the necrosis is symptomatic it could result in lingering pain to hot and cold stimuli, spontaneous pain that may cause a patient to wake up during sleep, difficulty with eating and being tender to percussion. If the necrosis is asymptomatic it will be non-responsive to thermal stimuli or electric pulp tests, the patient may even be unaware of the pathology.  Diagnosis  If the pulpal necrosis is asymptomatic it may go unnoticed by the patient and so a diagnosis may be missed without the use of special tests. To determine if pulp necrosis is present a dentist may take radiographic images (X-rays) and sensitivity testing e.g. hot or cold stimuli (using warm gutta percha or ethyl chloride); or they may use an electric pulp tester. Vitality of a tooth, which refers to blood supply to a tooth, may be assessed using doppler flowmetry. Sequelae of a necrotic pulp include acute apical periodontitis, dental abscess, or radicular cyst and discolouration of the tooth.  Prognosis & Treatment If a necrotic pulp is left untreated it may result in further complications such as infection, fever, swelling, abscesses and bone loss. Currently there are only two treatment options for teeth which have undergone pulpal necrosis. Future treatments aim to assess revascularisation of pulp tissue using techniques such as cell homing.  Pulp response to caries  Pulpal response to caries can be divided into two stages ‚Äì non-infected pulp and infected pulp. In caries-affected human teeth, there are odontoblast-like cell at the dentine-pulp interface and specialized pulp immune cells to combat caries. Once they identify specific bacterial components, these cells activate innate and adaptive aspects of dental pulp immunity. In a non-infected pulp, leukocytes are present to sample biologically and respond to the surrounding environment, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells and B cells. This sampling process is part of the normal protective immune response as it triggers leukocytes from the circulatory system to adhere to endothelial cells lining blood vessels and then migrate to the site of infection for defense potential. Macrophages can phagocytose bacteria and activate T cells triggering an adaptive immune response which occurs in association with DCs. In the pulp, DCs secrete a range of cytokines that influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, and they are considered key regulators of the tissue‚Äôs defense against infection. There is also a comparatively small number of B cells present in the healthy pulp tissue, and as there is pulpitis and caries progression, their numbers also increase. When bacteria get closer to the pulp but are still confined to primary or secondary dentine, acid demineralization of dentine will occur, leading to the production of tertiary dentine to help protect the pulp from further insult. After a pulp exposure, pulp cells are recruited, then differentiate into odontoblast-like cells, and contribute to the formation of a dentine bridge and thus increasing the residual dentin thickness. Odontoblast-like cell is a mineralized structure formed by a new population of pulp-derived which can be expressed as Toll-like receptors. They are responsible for the upregulation of innate immunity effectors, including antimicrobial agents and chemokines. One important antimicrobial agent produced by odontoblast is beta-defensins (BDs). BDs kill microorganisms by forming micropores that destroy membrane integrity and cause leakage of the cell content. Another one is nitric oxide (NO), a highly diffusible free radical, which stimulates the production of chemokine to attract immune cells into the affected areas and neutralize bacterial by-product in human pulp cells in vitro.  Pulp Stones  Pulp stones are calcified masses that occur in the pulp, either in the apical or coronal portions. They are classified according to their structure or location. According to their location, pulp stones can either be classed as free (completely surrounded by soft pulp tissue), embedded (surrounded by dentine tissue) or adherent (attached to pulp wall and are continuous with dentine but not fully enclosed). Depending on the structure of the pulp stones they are either true (dentine lined by odontoblasts), false (formed from degenerating cells that mineralise) or diffuse (more irregular in shape to false stones).The cause of pulp stones is little understood however it has been recorded that pulpal calcifications can occur due to: * Pulp degeneration * Increasing age (especially in the 4th advancing decade) * Orthodontic treatment * Trauma - traumatic occlusion * Dental caries Histologically, pulp stones usually consist of circular layers of mineralised tissues. These layers are made up of blood clots, dead cells and collagen fibres. Occasionally, pulp stones can be seen to be surrounded by odontoblast like cells that contain tubules. However, this type of pulp stone are rarely seen. The prevalence of pulp stones can reach as high as 50% in surveyed samples however pulp stones are estimated to range from 8-9%. Pulpal calcifications are more commonly found in females and more frequently found in maxillary teeth compared to mandibular teeth although the reason is unknown. They are also more common in molar teeth especially first molars compared to second molars and premolars. A systematic review suggested that the reason for this was because the first molars are the first teeth to be located in the mandible (lower jaw) and therefore longer exposure to degenerative changes.

Emperor Qinzong was the eldest son and heir apparent of Emperor Huizong. His mother was Emperor Huizong's empress consort, Empress Wang. In 1126, when the forces of the Jurchen-led Jin Empire invaded the Song Empire beginning the first siege of Bianjing. Frightened, Emperor Huizong intended to flee but was convinced by his officials to abdicate first and then flee. Huizong then abdicated and passed on his throne to Emperor Qinzong, and then assumed the title Taishang Huang (\\"Retired Emperor\\") himself and fled to the countryside.  Reign  Left to deal with the Jin invasion by himself, Emperor Qinzong appointed the general Li Gang () to lead the Song military to fend off the invaders. However, Emperor Qinzong was not a decisive leader and often made poor judgments. Eventually, he removed Li Gang from his appointment in the hope of starting peace talks with the Jin Empire and sent his younger brother Zhao Gou to negotiate but he was captured and ransomed. This may contribute to Emperor Gaozong's decision to not rescue Qinzong. The first siege of Bianjing ended after Qinzong gave a city to the Jurchens and paid them annual tribute. Emperor Huizong returned after hearing that the siege was over. = Causes of the Second Siege of Bianjing = Despite this, almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful. Emperor Qinzong rejected an proposal to reinforce the northern borders reasoning that they may never come back and sent his generals to other parts of the country. The Jin imperial court sent two ambassadors to Song. The two ambassadors were nobles from the former Liao dynasty. Emperor Qinzong misjudged the situation and believed that they could be used to turn against the Jin ruler, Emperor Taizong. Emperor Qinzong sent a coded letter which was sealed in candle wax, inviting them to join Song to form an Anti‚ÄìJin alliance but the ambassadors handed the letter to Emperor Taizong and in retaliation, accused Emperor Qinzong for violating the peace treaty and sent an even bigger army against the Song.  Capture  Since Qinzong mistakenly removed the army to post in different parts of the country, the Jin forces eventually breached the walls of the Song capital, Bianjing, in 1127 and occupied the city in an event historically known as the Jingkang Incident (\\"Jingkang\\" was the era name of Emperor Qinzong.) Emperor Qinzong, along with his father Emperor Huizong and the rest of their family, were taken prisoner by Jin forces, marking the end of the Northern Song. Qinzong's brother Zhao Gou managed to escape to southern China, where he reestablished the empire as the Southern Song dynasty and became historically known as Emperor Gaozong. = Life in the Jin Dynasty = Emperor Qinzong and his father were demoted to the status of commoners on 20 March 1127 and deported to Huining Prefecture, the Jin capital, on 13 May 1127. In 1128, the two former Song emperors were forced to wear mourning dresses and pay homage to the ancestors of the Jin Emperors at their ancestral temple in Huining Prefecture. Furthermore, the Jurchen ruler, Emperor Taizong, gave the two former Song emperors contemptuous titles to humiliate them: Emperor Qinzong was called \\"Marquis Chonghun\\" (ÈáçÊòè‰æØ; literally \\"Doubly Muddle-headed Marquis\\") while Emperor Huizong was called \\"Duke Hunde\\" (ÊòèÂæ∑ÂÖ¨; literally \\"Muddle-headed Duke\\"). In 1141, as the Jin Empire normalised relations with the (Southern) Song Empire, the Jurchens renamed Emperor Qinzong's title to the more neutral- sounding \\"Duke of Tianshui Commandery\\" (), which is based on a commandery located in the upper reaches of the Wei River. A few months later, the former emperor started receiving a stipend due to his nobility status. He lived the rest of his life as a captive in the Jin Empire, which used him as a hostage to put pressure on the Song Empire. In 1142, Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing which made peace with the Jin Dynasty. This destroyed Qinzong's chance of returning. In 1156, in an act of humiliation, the Jin Emperor who at the time was the Prince of Hailing ordered him and the former Emperor Tianzuo of Liao to compete in a match of polo. Emperor Qinzong was weak and frail, thus quickly fell off the horse. Emperor Tianzuo himself despite being very old, was more familiar to horse riding, tried to escape but was shot to death by Jurchen archers. Emperor Qinzong died as a sick and broken man in 1161 having spent two-thirds of his life in the Jin Dynasty. He was 61. His temple name means \\"Venerate Ancestor\\".

Transcendence The fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that if we have a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients then that polynomial will have a root in the complex numbers. That is, for any polynomial P with integer coefficients there will be a complex number Œ± such that P(Œ±) = 0. Transcendence theory is concerned with the converse question: given a complex number Œ±, is there a polynomial P with integer coefficients such that P(Œ±) = 0? If no such polynomial exists then the number is called transcendental. More generally the theory deals with algebraic independence of numbers. A set of numbers {Œ±1,Œ±2,‚Ä¶,Œ±n} is called algebraically independent over a field K if there is no non-zero polynomial P in n variables with coefficients in K such that P(Œ±1,Œ±2,‚Ä¶,Œ±n) = 0. So working out if a given number is transcendental is really a special case of algebraic independence where n=1 and the field K is the rational field. A related notion is whether there is a closed-form expression for a number, including exponentials and logarithms as well as algebraic operations. There are various definitions of \\"closed-form\\", and questions about closed-form can often be reduced to questions about transcendence. History =Approximation by rational numbers: Liouville to Roth= Use of the term transcendental to refer to an object that is not algebraic dates back to the seventeenth century, when Gottfried Leibniz proved that the sine function was not an algebraic function.N. Bourbaki, Elements of the History of Mathematics Springer (1994). The question of whether certain classes of numbers could be transcendental dates back to 1748. when Euler asserted that the number logab was not algebraic for rational numbers a and b provided b is not of the form b = ac for some rational c. Euler's assertion was not proved until the twentieth century, but almost a hundred years after his claim Joseph Liouville did manage to prove the existence of numbers that are not algebraic, something that until then had not been known for sure. His original papers on the matter in the 1840s sketched out arguments using continued fractions to construct transcendental numbers. Later, in the 1850s, he gave a necessary condition for a number to be algebraic, and thus a sufficient condition for a number to be transcendental.; Journal Math. Pures et Appl. 16, (1851), pp.133‚Äì142. This transcendence criterion was not strong enough to be necessary too, and indeed it fails to detect that the number e is transcendental. But his work did provide a larger class of transcendental numbers, now known as Liouville numbers in his honour. Liouville's criterion essentially said that algebraic numbers cannot be very well approximated by rational numbers. So if a number can be very well approximated by rational numbers then it must be transcendental. The exact meaning of \\"very well approximated\\" in Liouville's work relates to a certain exponent. He showed that if Œ± is an algebraic number of degree d ‚â• 2 and Œµ is any number greater than zero, then the expression :\\\\left\\\\alpha-\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right<\\\\frac{1}{q^{d+\\\\varepsilon}} can be satisfied by only finitely many rational numbers p/q. Using this as a criterion for transcendence is not trivial, as one must check whether there are infinitely many solutions p/q for every d ‚â• 2\\\\. In the twentieth century work by Axel Thue, Carl Siegel, and Klaus Roth And \\"Corrigendum\\", p. 168, . reduced the exponent in Liouville's work from d + Œµ to d/2 + 1 + Œµ, and finally, in 1955, to 2 + Œµ. This result, known as the Thue‚ÄìSiegel‚ÄìRoth theorem, is ostensibly best possible, since if the exponent 2 + Œµ is replaced by just 2 then the result is no longer true. However, Serge Lang conjectured an improvement of Roth's result; in particular he conjectured that q2+Œµ in the denominator of the right-hand side could be reduced to q2log(q)1+Œµ. Roth's work effectively ended the work started by Liouville, and his theorem allowed mathematicians to prove the transcendence of many more numbers, such as the Champernowne constant. The theorem is still not strong enough to detect all transcendental numbers, though, and many famous constants including e and œÄ either are not or are not known to be very well approximable in the above sense. =Auxiliary functions: Hermite to Baker= Fortunately other methods were pioneered in the nineteenth century to deal with the algebraic properties of e, and consequently of œÄ through Euler's identity. This work centred on use of the so-called auxiliary function. These are functions which typically have many zeros at the points under consideration. Here \\"many zeros\\" may mean many distinct zeros, or as few as one zero but with a high multiplicity, or even many zeros all with high multiplicity. Charles Hermite used auxiliary functions that approximated the functions ekx for each natural number k in order to prove the transcendence of e in 1873. His work was built upon by Ferdinand von Lindemann in the 1880s in order to prove that eŒ± is transcendental for nonzero algebraic numbers Œ±. In particular this proved that œÄ is transcendental since eœÄi is algebraic, and thus answered in the negative the problem of antiquity as to whether it was possible to square the circle. Karl Weierstrass developed their work yet further and eventually proved the Lindemann‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem in 1885. In 1900 David Hilbert posed his famous collection of problems. The seventh of these, and one of the hardest in Hilbert's estimation, asked about the transcendence of numbers of the form ab where a and b are algebraic, a is not zero or one, and b is irrational. In the 1930s Alexander Gelfond and Theodor Schneider proved that all such numbers were indeed transcendental using a non-explicit auxiliary function whose existence was granted by Siegel's lemma. This result, the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem, proved the transcendence of numbers such as eœÄ and the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider constant. The next big result in this field occurred in the 1960s, when Alan Baker made progress on a problem posed by Gelfond on linear forms in logarithms. Gelfond himself had managed to find a non-trivial lower bound for the quantity :\\\\beta_1\\\\log\\\\alpha_1 +\\\\beta_2\\\\log\\\\alpha_2\\\\, where all four unknowns are algebraic, the Œ±s being neither zero nor one and the Œ≤s being irrational. Finding similar lower bounds for the sum of three or more logarithms had eluded Gelfond, though. The proof of Baker's theorem contained such bounds, solving Gauss' class number problem for class number one in the process. This work won Baker the Fields medal for its uses in solving Diophantine equations. From a purely transcendental number theoretic viewpoint, Baker had proved that if Œ±1,...,Œ±n are algebraic numbers, none of them zero or one, and Œ≤1,...,Œ≤n are algebraic numbers such that 1,Œ≤1,...,Œ≤n are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then the number :\\\\alpha_1^{\\\\beta_1}\\\\alpha_2^{\\\\beta_2}\\\\cdots\\\\alpha_n^{\\\\beta_n} is transcendental.A. Baker, Linear forms in the logarithms of algebraic numbers. I, II, III, Mathematika 13 ,(1966), pp.204‚Äì216; ibid. 14, (1967), pp.102‚Äì107; ibid. 14, (1967), pp.220‚Äì228, =Other techniques: Cantor and Zilber= In the 1870s, Georg Cantor started to develop set theory and, in 1874, published a paper proving that the algebraic numbers could be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers, and thus that the set of transcendental numbers must be uncountable. Later, in 1891, Cantor used his more familiar diagonal argument to prove the same result. While Cantor's result is often quoted as being purely existential and thus unusable for constructing a single transcendental number, the proofs in both the aforementioned papers give methods to construct transcendental numbers. While Cantor used set theory to prove the plenitude of transcendental numbers, a recent development has been the use of model theory in attempts to prove an unsolved problem in transcendental number theory. The problem is to determine the transcendence degree of the field :K=\\\\mathbb{Q}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n,e^{x_1},\\\\ldots,e^{x_n}) for complex numbers x1,...,xn that are linearly independent over the rational numbers. Stephen Schanuel conjectured that the answer is at least n, but no proof is known. In 2004, though, Boris Zilber published a paper that used model theoretic techniques to create a structure that behaves very much like the complex numbers equipped with the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Moreover, in this abstract structure Schanuel's conjecture does indeed hold. Unfortunately it is not yet known that this structure is in fact the same as the complex numbers with the operations mentioned; there could exist some other abstract structure that behaves very similarly to the complex numbers but where Schanuel's conjecture doesn't hold. Zilber did provide several criteria that would prove the structure in question was C, but could not prove the so-called Strong Exponential Closure axiom. The simplest case of this axiom has since been proved, but a proof that it holds in full generality is required to complete the proof of the conjecture. Approaches A typical problem in this area of mathematics is to work out whether a given number is transcendental. Cantor used a cardinality argument to show that there are only countably many algebraic numbers, and hence almost all numbers are transcendental. Transcendental numbers therefore represent the typical case; even so, it may be extremely difficult to prove that a given number is transcendental (or even simply irrational). For this reason transcendence theory often works towards a more quantitative approach. So given a particular complex number Œ± one can ask how close Œ± is to being an algebraic number. For example, if one supposes that the number Œ± is algebraic then can one show that it must have very high degree or a minimum polynomial with very large coefficients? Ultimately if it is possible to show that no finite degree or size of coefficient is sufficient then the number must be transcendental. Since a number Œ± is transcendental if and only if P(Œ±) ‚â† 0 for every non-zero polynomial P with integer coefficients, this problem can be approached by trying to find lower bounds of the form : P(a) > F(A,d) where the right hand side is some positive function depending on some measure A of the size of the coefficients of P, and its degree d, and such that these lower bounds apply to all P ‚â† 0. Such a bound is called a transcendence measure. The case of d = 1 is that of \\"classical\\" diophantine approximation asking for lower bounds for :ax + b. The methods of transcendence theory and diophantine approximation have much in common: they both use the auxiliary function concept. Major results The Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem was the major advance in transcendence theory in the period 1900‚Äì1950. In the 1960s the method of Alan Baker on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers reanimated transcendence theory, with applications to numerous classical problems and diophantine equations. Open problems While the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem proved that a large class of numbers was transcendental, this class was still countable. Many well known mathematical constants are still not known to be transcendental, and in some cases it is not even known whether they are rational or irrational. A partial list can be found here. A major problem in transcendence theory is showing that a particular set of numbers is algebraically independent rather than just showing that individual elements are transcendental. So while we know that e and œÄ are transcendental that doesn't imply that e + œÄ is transcendental, nor other combinations of the two (except eœÄ, Gelfond's constant, which is known to be transcendental). Another major problem is dealing with numbers that are not related to the exponential function. The main results in transcendence theory tend to revolve around e and the logarithm function, which means that wholly new methods tend to be required to deal with numbers that cannot be expressed in terms of these two objects in an elementary fashion. Schanuel's conjecture would solve the first of these problems somewhat as it deals with algebraic independence and would indeed confirm that e+œÄ is transcendental. It still revolves around the exponential function, however, and so would not necessarily deal with numbers such as Ap√©ry's constant or the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant. Another extremely difficult unsolved problem is the so-called constant or identity problem.

A pasar malam is a street market in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore that opens in the evening, usually in residential neighbourhoods.malaysiasite.nl It brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as snacks, local favourite dishes, fruits, clothes, shoes, toys, balloons, watch and alarm clocks, knick-knacks and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. Unauthorized copies of DVDs, CDs and computer software are often sold at a pasar malam. Pasar malam might resemble a night festival or a fairground, where fair games and kiddy rides, like mini carousel or mini train ride may also present. Several quintessential fair snacks like cotton candy, ice cream, hot dogs and grilled sausages are also popular, next to the offerings of traditional local delicacies. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. Haggling over prices is a common practice at such markets. History Pasar Malam in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, period 1900-1940 In Indonesian archipelago, markets are traditionally held on different days with locations rotating among participating villages. This traditional economic custom is known as Hari Pasaran (lit. \\"market days\\") in Javanese. After being further developed, market was established more permanently like it is today. The night market is regarded as the continuation of this non-permanent market culture. Night market are usually held during special occasion or festival, such as Sekaten festival in Java, or held in Ramadhan nights, approximately a week before Lebaran. Among traditional night markets, one of the earliest and biggest was the annual Lunar New Year night market in Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. Held three days prior to Lunar New Year, this night market began in the late 1820s as an initiative of Tan Eng Goan, the 1st Majoor der Chineezen of Batavia, and became a prototype for similar night markets. After the discovery of electricity and lightbulb, night markets were held more frequently in colonial Dutch East Indies in early 20th century.

It was initially opened in 1866, obtaining notoriety as the most expensive non-metropolitan railway then built, but was never constructed between Shrewsbury and the Potteries. The line rapidly became very run down as a result of low revenues and poor maintenance, and was closed for safety reasons in June 1880, becoming one of the few railways to close in Victorian times. Attempts to re-open the line were made in the late 1880s and the 1890s by the Shropshire Railways, which took over the property, but these failed. After years of lying derelict, it re-opened as the Shropshire & Montgomeryshire Light Railway in 1911. History Construction of the Potteries, Shrewsbury & North Wales Railway followed a flurry of parliamentary activity, with nine Acts of Parliament obtained between 1862 and 1866. The West Shropshire Mineral Railway obtained three Acts relating to a main line between Yockleton, on the Shrewsbury & Welshpool Railway, and Llanymynech, on the Oswestry & Newtown Railway, in 1862‚Äì4. That was subsumed into the Shrewsbury & North Wales Railway in 1864, the SNWR obtaining three Acts by 1866 and being realigned to connect with the Shrewsbury & Welshpool Railway at Hookagate in the process. In 1865, after several attempts to penetrate the Potteries towns, the Shrewsbury & Potteries Junction Railway obtained an Act to connect Shrewsbury with Market Drayton, linking the SNWR with the North Staffordshire Railway. The SNWR obtained another Act in 1866 before amalgamating with the SPJR to become the Potteries, Shrewsbury & North Wales Railway on the same day. The main line was originally double track and was opened between Llanymynech and Potteries Junction, Shrewsbury, on 13 August 1866. The passenger station at Shrewsbury, intended to be temporary, was located near the Abbey and was accessed by a short and steep branch from near Coleham Junction. There was an extension beyond Llanymynech to Nantmawr, and a branch from Kinnerley to Criggion to serve stone quarries. The railway company was always short of money. A receiver was appointed and the line closed on for the first time 21 December 1866, re- opening in December 1868. The main line was probably singled between Ford and Llanymynech in 1868‚Äì9, and between Shrewsbury and Ford in 1875. The branches to Criggion and Llanyblodwel, on the Nantmawr branch, were formally opened for passengers in 1871 and 1872. Following a complaint to the Board of Trade concerning the condition of the Melverley river bridge, on the Criggion branch, the Board of Trade inspected the railway finding numerous track defects. The company had neither money nor will to carry out repairs and the line was abandoned in June 1880. Most of the stone traffic was continued after the Nantmawr branch was leased to the Cambrian Railways, the lease being made during June 1880. The Potteries, Shrewsbury & North Wales Railway (Winding Up) Act was obtained in 1881. =Nantmawr branch= After the suspension of service in June 1880, Cambrian Railways (CR) came to an agreement with R.S. France and the receiver on 28 January 1881, to maintain the stunted Nantmawr branch which accessed France's own quarries. The CR agreed to pay a royalty of 3d per ton, which was renewed, but the toll was reduced to 2d a ton in January 1886. On 11 April 1894, the CR agreed to build a deviation from its own Llanfyllin Branch to join the Nantmawr line at Wern. The Nantmawr branch reopened as a Cambrian subsidiary on 1 January 1896 and the deviation followed on 27 January. A lease for 99 years followed on 12 April 1900, with the CR paying ¬£555 a year: half itself, half from the Tanat Valley Light Railway, which opened on 5 January 1904. Closed by British Railways in 1988 after the limestone quarry ceased production, the line was acquired by the Tanat Valley Light Railway Company during 2004. Part of the line re-opened as a heritage railway in 2009. Locomotives Abbey Station, Shrewsbury, behind a Bury, Curtis and Kennedy 0-4-2 locomotive, 1872-1874 Little is known about the locomotives. According to WoodcockWoodcock, George, Minor Railways of England and their Locomotives, Goose & Son, Norwich, 1970, page 151 one of them, named Black Tom, was a 0-4-2 tender locomotive built by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy in 1848 and acquired from the London and North Western Railway in 1866. Shropshire & Montgomeryshire Light Railway In 1888 an act of Parliament authorised the railway to be transferred to the Shropshire Railways Company and reconstruction was started. The company, however, was very litigious and fell out several times with its potential contractors and its financiers. Reconstruction work ceased in 1891, and in 1895 the scheme finally collapsed when a fund-raising prospectus failed to mention that the company was in receivership. Starting in 1906 Colonel Holman Fred Stephens led a consortium which applied for a Light Railway Order, wishing to take over the railway, reconstruct it and to operate it as a light railway. Legal and financial difficulties slowed progress but an order was made in 1910 and the Shropshire & Montgomeryshire Light Railway was opened at Easter 1911.

Mintz. Book Two, page 120. Silk Pagoda (2006). He reigned over the apex of Baekje's powers. Background Geunchogo was the fourth son of the 11th king Biryu and became king upon the death of the 12th king Gye. His reign seems to have marked the permanent ascendancy of the descendants of the 5th king Chogo (reflected in Geunchogo's name) over those of the 8th king Goi, and ended the alternating kingship of the two lines.Park, Hyun Sook, ¬´Î∞±Ï†úÏùòÏ§ëÏïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÎ∞©¬ª(Central area and regions of Baekje), p. 71, Juryuseong, 2005, Strengthening royal power Upon ascending the throne, he set out to solidify the royal power within the Baekje state. He reduced the power of the aristocracy and set up a system of local government with regional heads appointed by the court. He married a wife from the Jin clan, setting a precedent for his successors, and he moved the capital to Hansan, today's southeast Seoul. Territorial expansion Under Geunchogo, the kingdom reached its greatest geographic extent and political power. The remaining tribes of Mahan were annexed in 369, completing Baekje's control over all of present-day Jeolla-do. Gaya confederacy states west of the Nakdong River were also made Baekje dependencies. In 369, Baekje was invaded by Goguryeo, but counterattacked in force at the Battle of Chiyang. In 371, the Baekje army of 30,000, led by Crown Prince Geungusu, took the fortress of Pyongyang and killed Gogugwon of Goguryeo. At the end of these conquests, Baekje ringed the Yellow Sea, and controlled much of the Korean peninsula, including all of Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla and parts of Gangwon and Hwanghae provinces. Foreign relations In 366, Geunchogo allied with Silla, which bordered Baekje on the east, maintaining a rough balance of power among the Three Kingdoms. At its greatest extent, Baekje control reached north into what is now China. The kingdom also established diplomatic relations with the early Jin China in 345 and Japan in 367.What Was the Baekje Kingdom? According to both Korean and Chinese sources, the first diplomatic contact between Baekje and China took place in 372, when Geunchogo sent a mission to the court of Jin. In the same year, the Jin court sent a mission granting him the title of the \\"General Stabilizing the East and the Administrator-General of Lelang\\" (ÏßÑÎèôÏû•Íµ∞ ÏòÅÎÇôÎûëÌÉúÏàò, Èé≠Êù±Â∞áËªçÈ†òÊ®ÇÊµ™Â§™ÂÆà). During his reign, Baekje activated and led the commercial trading among China, Korean Peninsula and Japan; known as the triangle trade. Traditionally the commerce was mostly dominated by Chinese emperors; however, after China lost control of Lelang, northern China came under the rule of Foreign People including Xiongnu, Xianbei and Qiang, all of whom were inexperienced at sea. Baekje established commanderies in the Liaoxi regions of China and advanced into Ky≈´sh≈´ of Japan, and rose as the new trading center of East Asia.Shin Hyeong Shik, A Brief History of Korea, Book1, p.29-30, Ewha Women's University Baekje also exported culture to Baekje's allies in the Wa kingdom of Yamato period Japan. The evidence of friendly relationship of Baekje with Japan is the Seven-Branched Sword which Geunchogo gave to the Yamato ruler. Geunchogo also sent scholars Wang In and Ajiki to Japan to spread knowledge of Baekje culture, Confucianism, and Chinese characters.Christopher Seeley, A History of Writing in Japan, p.23, p.141 Then Wani taught Confucian classics to emperor's heir Ujinowakiiratuko.Susan M. Allen, Lin Zuzao, The History and Cultural Heritage of Chinese Calligraphy Culture Also during his reign, a \\"history of Baekje\\" called Seogi (ÏÑúÍ∏∞, Êõ∏Ë®ò) was compiled by the scholar Go Heung (Í≥†Ìù•, È´òËàà). Its primary purpose was not only to record history, but also to justify his and his family's rule and to display the power of Baekje. However, it has not survived.

The king dispatched the crown prince with soldiers directly to Chiyang, and they quickly attacked and defeated them. They captured more than 5,000, and these prisoners were presented as gifts to the general and his warriors. Winter, 11th month. A great examination was made [of the troops] in the area south of the Han river. The flags used were all yellow. * 371 AD, Goguryeo raised soldiers and came. The king heard this, and his men hid in the ditches and canals. Then they suddenly rushed out and attacked them. The soldiers of Goguryeo were defeated. Winter. The king and the crown prince led 30,000 spirited troops to attack Goguryeo at the fortress of Pyeongyang. The King of Goguryeo, Sayu, fought powerfully to repel them, but was hit by a stray arrow and died. Our king led his men to retreat, and we moved our capital to Mt.

The name is Welsh for \\"Church of the Monks\\". The village is on the banks of the river Vyrnwy, and the Montgomery Canal passes through it. The border runs for the most part along the frontages of the buildings on the east (English) side of the village's main street, with the eastern half of the village in England and the western half in Wales. The Church of England parish church of St Agatha lies just in England, although the entire village lies in the same ecclesiastical parish. The border also passed right through the now closed Lion pub, which had two bars in Shropshire and one in Montgomeryshire. At one time Welsh counties were referred to as \\"wet\\" or \\"dry\\" depending on whether people could drink in pubs on Sundays. When Montgomeryshire was dry it was legal to drink on Sundays in the two English bars of the Lion but not the Welsh bar. Two of the remaining open pubs in the village are entirely in England and the third is entirely in Wales. Just to the north of the village is Pant. Further north is the English market town of Oswestry. The community of Llanymynech and Pant had a population of 1,675 as of the 2011 census. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=E04011304 History Llanymynech Hill is one of Wales' earliest mining sites. Evidence suggests that copper was mined and smelted here in the late Bronze Age, and that ores were used to make bronze weapons and other implements. The hill above Llanymynech is crowned with an extensive Iron Age hillfort, which extends over 57 hectares, and surrounds a cave opening known as the Ogof. The size of this hillfort is probably explained by the presence of the copper mines. The hillfort would have served as protection for the mine, and housed the labourers employed in the extraction of copper. The Bronze Age British miners would have used fire-setting mining techniques, but with the arrival of the Romans the cavern was extended and more extensively mined. According to the Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust, before the hill was landscaped for the current golf course, at least ten shafts were visible on the southern part of the hill, together with a large number of shallow pits and shaft-mounds. The main entrance to the mine is still the Ogof. A number of Roman artefacts have been found in the mine including a number of bones and burials, and a hoard of 30 first and second century silver coins of Roman currency found in 1965 by some schoolboys, now conserved at the National Museum of Wales. The mine was probably abandoned c. 200 CE. In early medieval times, Offa's Dyke was built c. 430 and 652, through what is probably the main street in Llanymynech, on the east side of the road. It is thought the west wall of St Agatha's churchyard was built on the raised part of the dyke. Today, the Offa's Dyke Path passes through the village. Under the Normans, the town came under the rule of the Marcher Lord (Lord of the March or border counties), and a fortification called Carreghofa Castle was built by the Earl of Shrewsbury around 1101. The place where the castle was probably built, at Tanat Camp, just to the west of Llanymynech Hill and overlooking the Tanat valley, implies it was defending the hill which was being mined for copper and lead, as well as silver. Being situated directly on the borderlands, the castle changed hands between the English and Welsh numerous times during the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1187 the castle was captured by Owain Fychan, prince of Powys, who was then murdered at the castle by his cousins Gwenwynwyn and Cadwallon. In 1194, the castle was recaptured by the English with the purpose of reopening the mines on Llanymynech Hill and extracting silver. Richard I had been captured and held for a ransom of ¬£100,000, and the Bishop of Salisbury, Hubert Walter, heard of the discovery of silver at the Carreghofa Mine on Llanymynech Hill; he decided to develop the mine and reopen the mint at Shrewsbury to refine the silver and make it into coins. Unfortunately, the total amount of silver produced only came to the value of ¬£20, 11 shillings and 11 pence. This mine was located north of the present quarry, and just south of the present golf course clubhouse. In the 1230s, the castle was destroyed and the stones were eventually removed and used to construct nearby Carreghofa Hall. Very little remains of the castle today. Governance The English-Welsh border runs through the village, approximately following the A483 through the village. Therefore, Llanymynech is served by both an English and a Welsh service for everything. Dyfed-Powys Police cover the Welsh side of the village, West Mercia Police cover the English side; Powys Council are responsible for waste collection, recycling, and other council services on the Welsh side, Shropshire Council on the English side, and so on. The English part of the village is in the civil parish of Llanymynech and Pant, and in the electoral ward of Llanymynech in Shropshire. This ward had a population at the 2011 census of 3,988. The 2011 census output area covering the English part of the village has a population of 477. The Welsh part of the village is in the community of Carreghofa in Powys. The 2011 census output area covering the Welsh part of the village has a population of 323 of which 29% could speak, read and write Welsh. Features Llanymynech hill is now the site of Llanymynech Golf Club perched on top of the cliffs, whose 18-hole course is the only one in Europe to straddle a country border, being partly in England and partly in Wales. The village is home to one of only three remaining Hoffmann kilns in the British Isles, and the only one with a chimney. The kiln at Llanymynech was used for lime burning. The area around the kiln is designated as the Llanymynech Heritage Area. The former limestone quarry which fed the kiln is now the Shropshire Wildlife Trust's Llanymynech Rocks Nature Reserve, and its cliff face is popular with rock climbers. Transport The Montgomery Canal passing through Llanymynech The former goods yard of Due to the local limestone and mineral deposits, Llanymynech became a transport hub. First to arrive was a branch of the Ellesmere Canal, where it joined the eastern section of the Montgomeryshire Canal at Carreghofa. Today the canal is known as the Montgomery Canal, and the section through Llanymynech is isolated, with an section being navigable to boats. To the north to Pant the canal is dry; to the south the canal is isolated by lowered bridges. A campaign is in hand to restore the canal to through traffic. The main line of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (O&NR;) arrived from the south in 1860, a later constituent part of the Cambrian Railways (CR). In 1863, the Cambrian completed the construction of the Llanfyllin branch, a railway constructed to enable distribution of minerals in competition with the canal. Stipulated in the authorising Act of Parliament to avoid flat crossing of the existing canal and Tanat Valley Light Railway (TVLR), bridges had to be constructed to enable operations. The later Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway (Potts), which ran to , originally ran under the O&NR; and the canal to enable the Nantmawr branch for similar mineral extraction purposes. However, after it ran into financial difficulties, the CR took over the Nantmawr branch, agreeing to rebuild the southern end of the Potts so that it now junctioned through Llanymynech. After failing to junction with the GWR and the LNWR at Shrewsbury, the S&NR; suffered from low traffic and continual financial difficulties, having now also lost its main revenue stream from the Nantmawr branch. Taken over by the GWR under the Railways Act 1921, it was again closed to passengers on 6 November 1933, but remained open as a military freight route until 1960. The CR mainline from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965 in favour of the more viable Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway route. This also resulted in the closure of the Llanfyllin branch. The Nantmawr branch remained in operation until the 1998, with the track from Oswestry still in place today. Although no railway now serves Llanymynech, both the Cambrian Heritage Railways and the enthusiast-revived TVLR plan to reconnect Llanymynech with their heritage railway schemes. The A483 trunk road is the main road through the centre of Llanymynech. A bypass was announced in the 2020 budget.

Llanymynech Football Club  Llanymynech Football was reformed in 2011. They currently compete in the Montgomeryshire Football League 2 which they were last promoted from in 2015. They place their home games at Station Road on the English side of the village and play in a kit consisting of red shirt, white shorts and red and white hooped socks. The club can trace its roots back as far as 1896 when a \\"Llanymynech Reds\\" club played in the village. A football club was formed in the village as far back as 1858.

Her home has since been made into the Florence Griswold Museum, a National Historic Landmark. Life and work Florence Griswold was the youngest daughter of Helen Powers Griswold and ship captain Robert Harper Griswold. As one of Old Lyme‚Äôs oldest and richest families, the Griswolds enjoyed a privileged life until economic difficulties changed the family‚Äôs fortunes. Helen decided to convert the family home to a finishing school for young ladies and opened the Griswold Home School for Girls in 1878 where Florence, along with her mother and two sisters, taught. Throughout her life, Florence would continue to confront financial difficulties, and by the late 1890s, she found herself alone on the family homestead. She transformed the school into a boarding house and began to rent rooms for $7 per week. In 1899, artist Henry Ward Ranger, recently returned from Europe and inspired by the example of the French Barbizon artists, rented a room from Griswold (who is still affectionately referred to as 'Miss Florence' in Old Lyme) and encouraged his acquaintances to do likewise. Over 135 American artists boarded in the Florence Griswold House from 1899 through the 1930s and were invited to paint a panel on the walls or doors of the house. Over 43 panels now adorn the house, with a concentration in the Dining Room. Childe Hassam arrived in 1903 and he, in turn, invited Willard Metcalf, who arrived in 1905. Among the women artists who stayed and painted at Miss Florence's were Matilda Browne and sisters Lydia and Breta Longacre. Many other American Impressionist painters summered at the colony, in Griswold's house, among them Wilson Irvine, who arrived in 1914. Also, Edward Charles Volkert who became known as \\"America's cattle painter\\", and William Henry Howe, another cattle painter, who there was referred to as \\"Uncle\\" because of his age.William Henry Howe Ellen Axson Wilson, first wife of president Woodrow Wilson, came as an art student and became friends with Griswold; in 1914 Griswold attended the wedding of Presidential daughter Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre. Many American impressionist paintings of the era are of subjects in and around the Griswold house. Looking back on this era of artistic prosperity, Griswold commented in 1939, \\"So you see, first the artists adopted Lyme, and then Lyme adopted the artists, and now, today, Lyme and art are synonymous.\\" A portion of Griswold's land was purchased by the Lyme Art Association in 1917 so that a gallery could be built. She became its first manager when it opened in 1921. Florence Griswold Museum Old Lyme resident Harry Hoffman helped to save Griswold's house through a fund-raising campaign so that it could be converted into a museum.\\"Harry Leslie Hoffman\\". The Cooley Gallery. Retrieved Nov. 26, 2017. First called the Florence Griswold House, it is now known as the Florence Griswold Museum. Located at 96 Lyme Street in Old Lyme, the house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. In July 2007 the building reopened after a 14-month restoration project. The museum exhibits both American art and historical material. Its collection spans fine art, sculpture, works on paper, artist's studio material, toys and dolls, ceramics, furniture, textiles, decorative arts and historic artifacts, and the Lyme Historical Society archives.

Functions of the Bank The Croatian National Bank is the central bank of the Republic of Croatia and part of the European System of Central Banks. The primary objective of the CNB is maintaining price stability and the stability of the financial system as a whole. The Croatian National Bank executes monetary policy, manages international reserves of the Republic of Croatia, issues the Croatian currency - the kuna, issues authorisations of credit institutions, credit unions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions and supervises their operation. The CNB also issues authorisations of authorised exchange offices. The Croatian National Bank is autonomous and independent in achieving its objective and carrying out its tasks. The CNB reports on its work to the Croatian Parliament. Independence of the CNB ''' The independence of the central bank is a key precondition for a successful and credible implementation of monetary policy and for the achievement of the main objective of the central bank - maintenance of price stability. The independence of the Croatian National Bank is in accordance with Article 130 of the Treaty on European Union, which guarantees the independence of national central banks of the European Union. There are several aspects of central bank independence: functional, institutional, personal and financial. Functional independence implies a clearly defined objective and autonomy in the choice of measures and instruments for its realisation. Institutional independence means that central bank decisions are independent from the influence of other institutions. Personal independence guarantees the protection of CNB officials from external pressures, excludes conflicts of interest and precisely defines the conditions for the appointment and removal from office of the Governor and other members of the CNB Council. Financial independence implies the possibility for the CNB to autonomously obtain funds for the purpose of executing its mandate, with the income and expense determined by the monetary policy stance. =Monetary stability= Stable prices is the main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by making sure price increases meet the Government's inflation target.hnb.hr/o-hnb =Financial stability= Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations. The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability.

Biography Sturdza is considered the first indigenous ruler with the end of Phanariote rule (as a move the Ottoman Empire undertook after seeing the political disadvantages of Greek domination after the troubles in the Greek War of Independence). Immediately after the Greek revolution, Prince Ioan Sturdza took an active part in subduing the roving bands of Eterists in Moldavia; he transformed the Greek language elementary schools into Romanian language ones and laid the foundation for that scientific national development which Prince Mihai Sturdza continued after 1834, especially after his founding of an upper school in the Trei Ierarhi Cathedral complex in Ia»ôi. Although his project for the confiscation of some Church properties was initially blocked by Russia, Sturdza opted not to revise his position. Contested by the boyars who had taken refuge in Imperial Russia during Ypsilanti's military rule over the country, and threatened to lose his throne after the 1826 Russo-Turkish Akkerman Convention that established a seven-year term in office for Princes elected by the Divan (confirmed by the Ottomans, with Russia's approval), Sturdza agreed to many boyar demands, including tax cuts and exemptions from conscription. However, Sturdza ensured meritocratic criteria in access to public offices. At the same time, a conflict became apparent between high- and low-ranking boyars, after the proposed constitution of IonicƒÉ TƒÉutu was rejected by most of the former (a vocal minority under the leadership of Mihail Sturdza). In 1828, the Russians entered the country during the War and took Prince Ioan prisoner. He died while being kept in Bessarabia and was later buried in Ia»ôi. Marriage and issue He married Elisabeth Hufelund, daughter of German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. They had: Prince Nicolae ‚ö≠ Princess Maria Rosetti-Roznovau, their daughter Princess Pulcheria (1831-1874) became mother of Queen Natalie of Serbia and grandmother of King Alexander I of Serbia.

It is one of the zones of BBMP. It is sub- divided into seven wards. The foundation of Jayanagar was laid in the year 1948. It is surrounded by Basavanagudi, JP Nagar, Wilson Garden, Banashankari 2nd stage, Gurappanapalya, Suddaguntepalya and BTM Layout among other areas. It is in proximity to the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens. Jayanagar has 10 area blocks (including 4th 'T' Block), of which the 3rd and 4th blocks are largely commercial hubs, while the rest are mostly residential. A 2010 survey by DNA Bangalore ranked Jayanagar as the most liveable place in Bangalore and still maintains the old charm of the city. History In Kannada, Jayanagar splits into Jaya and nagar literally meaning Victory City. It is not definitively known why that is. One school of thought is that Jaya comes from Mysore's Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. The foundation of Jayanagar was laid in 1948. It was one of the first planned neighbourhoods in Bangalore and, at the time, the largest in Asia. Jayanagar constituency has seven wards and had 1.8 lakh voters . Jayanagar was traditionally regarded as the southern end of Bangalore. The \\"South End Circle\\", where six roads meet, and the historic Ashoka Pillar (which was to mark the southern end) bear this fact. While newer extensions have taken away this distinction from Jayanagar, it remains one of the more southern parts of the city. In 1976, during the regime of D. Devaraj Urs, another iconic structure was added to Jayanagar, the Jayanagar BDA Shopping complex. It also housed the famous Puttanna Kanagal theatre. There was a fire in 2008. Later a new development project was initiated in 2011-2012 during the tenure of B. S. Yediyurappa and B. N.

They compiled information and named the new lands; this expedition arrived at the gulf after passing through the Netherlands Antilles and the Peninsula of Paraguan√°. Colombia and Venezuela have disputed the reach of their territorial waters in the gulf. This border dispute surged after the independence of Colombia and Venezuela from Spain in the first half of the 19th century.

The hamlets of Wressle, Castlethorpe, and part of Scawby Brook lie within the parish boundaries. A settlement existed at Broughton in the Neolithic Stone Age (New Stone Age). Stone tools have been found particularly on the commons near Wressle. Pottery was discovered at a house on Ermine Street in 1956, thought to date back to the Bronze Age period. There were burials discovered around 1850 in the commons to the north-east of Broughton. Broughton's St Mary's Church is a Grade I listed building. It is thought to date to the 11th century with major alterations in the 12th, 14th and 17th centuries. Gokewell Priory was founded nearby in the late 12th century to house a community of nuns. The Baronetcy of Broughton was created 11 December 1660 for Sir Edmund Anderson and became extinct on the death of the 9th Baron, Sir Charles Henry John Anderson, 8 October 1891. To the west and north, Broughton has extensive woodlands that stretch toward Dragonby, Scunthorpe and Appleby.

He devoted a large portion of his life to the pursuit of his unified field theory, Heim theory. One of his childhood ambitions was to develop a method of space travel, which contributed to his motivation to find such a theory. During World War II, Heim was conscripted into the air force. However, a previous essay about explosives led to his working briefly in a chemical laboratory as an explosives technician, instead. An explosion in the laboratory caused by the mishandling of unstable compounds left him with debilitating handicaps. The accident left him without hands and mostly deaf and blind when he was 19, forcing him to use Krukenberg hands. Illobrand von Ludwiger claims this to be a terrorist assassination attempt, for which Heim saved the assassins life by \\"forgiving him\\". Neither name nor motivation of the claimed assassin nor details of the \\"forgiving\\" and how this saved his life are given. His behavior subsequently became progressively eccentric and reclusive. Eventually, he retreated into almost total seclusion, concentrating on developing and refining his theory of everything. Academic and work history A large proportion of the 76 years of Heim's life was spent on theoretical physics and the formulation of his Heim theory. =1940s= In 1943 Heim met Heisenberg, who was involved in German atom bomb research at that time, and told him of his plan to use chemical implosion to facilitate an atomic explosion. This design was based on his idea he developed for a 'clean' hydrogen bomb when he was 18. Heisenberg was impressed by Heim's knowledge, but thought the approach would be impractical. At that point Heim had to do military service in the German air force. He sent a paper on explosives to the Chemical-Technical 'Reichsanstalt' in Berlin, whereupon he was summoned to work there on the development of the proposed new explosives. It was here that he met with the accident that handicapped him for life. In 1946, Heim registered at the University of G√∂ttingen to study physics. He fulfilled his academic degree requirements with the help of companions. Afterwards, he continued to study a variety of topics including medicine, psychology, electronics, history and theology. =1950s= In 1952, during the third congressional session of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in Stuttgart, Germany, Burkhard Heim presented his theory for interplanetary propulsion under the title of ‚ÄúDie dynamische Kontrabarie als L√∂sung des astronautischen Problems‚Äù (The Dynamic Kontrabarie as solution of the Astronautical Problem). It was the first time the idea of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces were treated as distortions of their proper Euclidean metrics in a higher-dimensional space. A brief description of Heim's lecture was recorded in the proceedings of the Society for Space Research. In 1954 he began to study under Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker in G√∂ttingen. He wrote his diploma thesis on physical processes in the Crab Nebula Supernova. After this, he began to work at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in G√∂ttingen. However, he soon found it extremely difficult to work in a team due to his handicaps. Von Weizs√§cker also did not want to burden Heim with the development of a unified field theory. However, this was essentially his primary interest. Also, his second IAF presentation was given in 1954, Innsbruck, Austria, during its fifth congress. News about his presentations may have been relayed to the United States by the American representatives, Frederick C. Durant III and Andrew G. Haley, who were serving as President and Vice President, respectively, of the IAF during its fifth congress. During the 1955 holiday week of Thanksgiving Day, the New York Herald Tribune, and The Miami Herald carried announcements about the completion of contractual arrangements between Burkhard Heim and Glenn L. Martin Company. Heim was to assist them with their gravity control propulsion project. The news about Heim's contract was among several revelations that had been published during the period of intensified United States gravity control propulsion research (1955 - 1974). In 1956, Heim completed a twenty-seven paged progress report. Copies of it and its English translation were archived at the Gravity Research Foundation. It had summarized his philosophy (syntrometry) and his theory (Principle of Dynamic Contrabarie) for coupling general relativity with quantum dynamics for propulsion applications. Sample calculations for an expedition from the surface of the Earth to the surface of the planet Mars appeared at the end of Heim's progress report. His six- dimensional meso-field-equations required only 285 kg of fuel to be expended to propel a manned vehicle, with the empty weight of fifty tons, on a round trip lasting only 336 hours. Those calculations allowed 111 hours for interplanetary travel, 100 hours to explore Mars, and fourteen hours to perform engine overhaul and launch preparations. His endothermic process required a maximum cooling rate of 1.2 GW. In November 1957, Heim delivered a lecture about his propulsion theory to the Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Raketentechnik und Raumfahrt (German Society for Rocket Technology and Space Travel), Frankfurt. Subsequently, Wernher von Braun sought his comments on various aerospace projects. According to von Ludwiger, an audiotape of Heim's presentation had been prepared for shipment to America. In 1959, Heim completed his first publication in the obscure German journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Flugk√∂rper (Magazine for Missiles). It carried a series of four articles about his theory. The series of papers carried claims and sample calculations that were similar to his 1956 progress report at the Gravity Research Foundation. Heim discussed \\"the principle of the dynamic Kontrabarie\\" in which he examined how a field drive would be more effective than the best chemical drive for rockets. These papers remained ambiguous on the fundamental concepts underlying his theory of the field drive, likely due to the necessity to complete the calculations on the extra fields of his field theory. These calculations were not performed until a few years later. Heim was very mindful of keeping his work from others and worried about plagiarism. In particular, he saw some colleagues as possible plagiarists. One other reason for his distrust of others was due to a colleague who embezzled donations from a society he founded in 1959. (The Institut f√ºr Kraftfeldphysik e.V. was intended to develop test models of his propulsion concepts.) Heim stopped work on the propulsion aspect of his theory in 1959. Neither failures nor flaws had made Heim discontinue his propulsion research ‚Äì it was the unbridled interest of unsavory firms. The preface by Helmut Goeckel to Heim's first paper in the series of four articles published by Magazine for Missiles indicated various aerospace and ordnance companies had made several attempts to kidnap him. Subsequently, the remainder of his life was devoted to refining the unified field attributes of his theory. =1960s= In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were a number of reports on Heim in magazines and tabloids such as Le Figaro, Bunte Illustrierte, Quick and Stern. The magazine le Figaro remarked, on 15 January 1969, that he was an \\"inhuman robot\\". Also, the main German TV station, ARD, ran reports and interviews with Heim. It was speculated that Heim was likely to make a breakthrough, either in fundamental physics or propulsion theory. On 17 November 1969 Heim reported the progress he had made towards developing his unified field theory to Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB). Pascual Jordan and Gebhard Lyra were among the small body of scientists who attended that colloquium. Jordan wrote Heim a letter on 22 December 1969 encouraging him to publish his theory. =1970s= Ludwig B√∂lkow encouraged Heim to enhance his theory. On 25 November 1976 Heim publicly introduced, for the first time, his completed unified field theory in a presentation to MBB engineers. It included the methodology for calculating the mass spectrum of elementary particles. Pursuant to recommendations by Werner Heisenberg‚Äôs successor, Hans-Peter D√ºrr, Heim published his unified field theory summary, the following year, in an article entitled Recommendations of a Way to a Unified Description of Elementary Particles in the Max Planck Institute journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Naturforschung. This was the first publication of his theory in a peer reviewed scientific journal. =1980s= In 1982 Heim's mass formula was programmed on a computer at the German Electron Synchrotron DESY in Hamburg with the assistance of some resident scientists. Up to that point, Heim had not yet confided in other theoretical physicists on the details of the mass formula derivation. Hence, the DESY results were not widely published and disseminated for academic scrutiny. That year Walter Dr√∂scher, a theorist at the Vienna Patent Office, began to work with Heim. The first result of their collaboration cumulated into the second volume of Heim's major work, appearing in 1984. =1990s= In 1992, Hans Theodor Auerbach and Illobrand von Ludwiger presented a summary of Heim's unified field theory of elementary particles and their internal structures. It contained Heim's derivation of Sommerfeld's fine structure constant (Œ±‚àí = 1/137.0360085) ‚Äì it was a close approximation of the 1987 measured value (Œ± = 1/137.035989). =2000s= Heim died in Northeim in 2001 at age 75. In 2004, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) awarded the winning paper in the nuclear and future flight field to a retired Austrian patent officer named Walter Dr√∂scher and Jochem H√§user, a physicist and professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany. They turned the theoretical framework of Burkhard Heim into a proposal for an experimental test for a propulsion device that is thought to theoretically be able to travel at rates faster than the speed of light. Hans Theodor Auerbach, a theoretical physicist and someone who has worked alongside Heim has stated that, \\"As far as I understand it, Heim theory is ingenious,\\" and, \\"I think that physics will take this direction in the future\\". In 2008, the AIAA Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion Technical Committee published the following statement: ::Much research was conducted this year on the investigation of the experimental basis of the existence of gravity-like fields that cannot be described by conventional gravitation; that is, by the accumulation of mass. Investigations emphasized a geometrized approach termed Extended Heim Theory, which extends Einstein's idea of geometrization of physics by employing the additional concepts of Heim. Life and health Heim had to undergo a series of at least 50 operations after a laboratory explosion resulted in the loss of his arms. He found that intense concentration on the study of Einstein's relativity theory helped him control the pain in his arms mentally and physically. The loss of his hands and serious diminution of his eyesight apparently resulted in Heim acquiring an eidetic, acoustic memory. He was claimed to rarely forget a formula if he heard it recited, and was said to be able to learn a language in a matter of days. He married a former concert singer from Prague in 1950 named Gerda.  Heim theory and the physics community  Heim achieved some media renown in the 1950s and 1960s, but his ideas have never been well-accepted in the physics community. A significant portion of Heim's work has not been published in rigorously peer reviewed journals. Heim's theory also predicts the existence of two hypothetical neutrinos, which have been shown not to exist by experiments at the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider.

ROSAT (short for R√∂ntgensatellit, in German X-rays are called R√∂ntgenstrahlen, in honour of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen) was a German Aerospace Center-led satellite X-ray telescope, with instruments built by West Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was launched on 1 June 1990, on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, on what was initially designed as an 18-month mission, with provision for up to five years of operation. ROSAT actually operated for over eight years, finally shutting down on 12 February 1999. In February 2011, it was reported that the satellite was unlikely to burn up entirely while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere due to the large amount of ceramics and glass used in construction. Parts as heavy as could impact the surface intact. ROSAT eventually re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 23 October 2011 over Bay of Bengal.  Overview  According to NASA, the Roentgensatellit (ROSAT) was a joint German, U.S. and British X-ray astrophysics project. ROSAT carried a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a grazing incidence four-fold nested Wolter I telescope with an 84-cm diameter aperture and 240-cm focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5 arcsecond at half energy width (the \\"angle within which half of the electromagnetic radiation\\"ESA Science Glossary is focused). The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2 keV (one thousand Electronvolt). In addition, a British-supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope, the Wide Field Camera (WFC), was coaligned with the XRT and covered the energy band from 0.042 to 0.21 keV (30 to 6 nm). ROSAT's unique strengths were high spatial resolution, low-background, soft X-ray imaging for the study of the structure of low surface brightness features, and for low-resolution spectroscopy. The ROSAT spacecraft was a three-axis stabilized satellite which can be used for pointed observations, for slewing between targets, and for performing scanning observations on great circles perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. ROSAT was capable of fast slews (180 deg. in ~15 min.) which makes it possible to observe two targets on opposite hemispheres during each orbit. The pointing accuracy was 1 arcminute with stability less than 5 arcsec per sec and jitter radius of ~10 arcsec. Two CCD star sensors were used for optical position sensing of guide stars and attitude determination of the spacecraft. The post facto attitude determination accuracy was 6 arcsec. The ROSAT mission was divided into two phases: # After a two-month on-orbit calibration and verification period, an all-sky survey was performed for six months using the PSPC in the focus of XRT, and in two XUV bands using the WFC. The survey was carried out in the scan mode. # The second phase consists of the remainder of the mission and was devoted to pointed observations of selected astrophysical sources. In ROSAT's pointed phase, observing time was allocated to Guest Investigators from all three participating countries through peer review of submitted proposals. ROSAT had a design life of 18 months, but was expected to operate beyond its nominal lifetime.  Instruments  = X-ray Telescope (XRT) = The main assembly was a German- built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a grazing incidence four-fold nested Wolter I telescope with an diameter aperture and focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5 arcsec at half energy width. The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2 keV. = Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (two) (PSPC) = PSPC shot of Abell 2256 Each Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) is a thin-window gas counter. Each incoming X-ray photon produces an electron cloud whose position and charge are detected using two wire grids. The photon position is determined with an accuracy of about 120 micrometers. The electron cloud's charge corresponds to the photon energy, with a nominal spectral bandpass 0.1-2.4 keV. = High Resolution Imager (HRI) = The US-supplied High Resolution Imager used a crossed grid detector with a position accuracy to 25 micrometers. The instrument was damaged by solar exposure on 20 September 1998. = Wide Field Camera (WFC) = The Wide Field Camera (WFC) was a UK- supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope co-aligned with the XRT and covered the wave band between 300 and 60 angstroms (0.042 to 0.21 keV).

See also :Category:ROSAT objects  Launch  ROSAT was originally planned to be launched on the Space Shuttle but the Challenger disaster caused it to be moved to the Delta platform. This move made it impossible to recapture ROSAT with a Shuttle and bring it back to Earth.  End of operations  Originally designed for a five-year mission, ROSAT continued in its extended mission for a further four years before equipment failure forced an end to the mission. For some months after this, ROSAT completed its very last observations before being finally switched off on 12 February 1999. On 25 April 1998, failure of the primary star tracker on the X-ray Telescope led to pointing errors that in turn had caused solar overheating. A contingency plan and the necessary software had already been developed to utilise an alternative star tracker attached to the Wide Field Camera. ROSAT was soon operational again, but with some restrictions to the effectiveness of its tracking and thus its control. It was severely damaged on 20 September 1998 when a reaction wheel in the spacecraft's Attitude Measuring and Control System (AMCS) reached its maximum rotational speed,A reaction wheel operates by changing its rotational velocity, conservation of angular momentum then causing the more massive satellite to rotate in opposition. Their maximum speed is limited by design, which in turn means they are limited in the rotational velocity they can impart to a satellite. \\"Reaching maximum speed\\" means merely that it cannot impart any more velocity change, not that it's approaching mechanical damage to itself. losing control of a slew, damaging the High Resolution Imager by exposure to the sun. This failure was initially attributed to the difficulties of controlling the satellite under these difficult circumstances outside its initial design parameters. = Allegations of cyber-attacks causing the failure = In 2008, NASA investigators were reported to have found that the ROSAT failure was linked to a cyber-intrusion at Goddard Space Flight Center. This was also reported through Bruce Schneier's blog, a highly regarded commentary on IT security issues. The root of this allegation is a 1999 advisory report by Thomas Talleur, senior investigator for cyber-security at NASA. This advisory is reported to describe a series of attacks from Russia that reached computers in the X-ray Astrophysics Section (i.e. ROSAT's) at Goddard, and took control of computers used for the control of satellites, not just a passive \\"snooping\\" attack. The advisory stated: > \\"Hostile activities compromised [NASA] computer systems that directly and > indirectly deal with the design, testing, and transferring of satellite > package command-and-control codes.\\" The advisory is further reported as claiming that the ROSAT incident was \\"coincident with the intrusion\\" and that, \\"Operational characteristics and commanding of the ROSAT were sufficiently similar to other space assets to provide intruders with valuable information about how such platforms are commanded,\\". Without public access to the advisory, it is obviously impossible to comment in detail. While it does seem to describe a real intrusion, there is a plausible \\"no attack\\" explanation for ROSAT's failure, and the report is claimed to link the two incidents as no more than \\"coincident.\\" IT security remains a significant issue for NASA. Other systems including the Earth Observing System have also been attacked. 13 November 2007, p.3  Re-entry  ROSAT: one of the last images of ROSAT before reentry In 1990, the satellite was put in an orbit at an altitude of and inclination of 53¬∞.http://www.mpe.mpg.de/xray/wave/rosat/mission/rosat/launch.php Due to atmospheric drag, the satellite slowly lost height until, in September 2011, the satellite was orbiting approximately above the Earth. On 23 October 2011 ROSAT re-entered the Earth's atmosphere sometime between 1:45 UTC and 2:15 UTC over the Bay of Bengal, east of India. There was no confirmation if pieces of debris had reached the Earth's surface.  Successor  eROSITA launched on board the Russian-German Spektr-RG space observatory in 2019. It will provide an updated all-sky survey of the X-ray sky, extending the energy range to 10keV, increase the sensitivity by a factor of 25 and improve the spatial and spectral resolution.

Disk encryption typically takes form in either software (see disk encryption software) or hardware (see disk encryption hardware). Disk encryption is often referred to as on-the-fly encryption (OTFE) or transparent encryption. = Software versus hardware- based mechanisms for protecting data = Software-based security solutions encrypt the data to protect it from theft. However, a malicious program or a hacker could corrupt the data in order to make it unrecoverable, making the system unusable. Hardware-based security solutions prevent read and write access to data, hence offering very strong protection against tampering and unauthorized access. Hardware based security or assisted computer security offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Security tokens such as those using PKCS#11 may be more secure due to the physical access required in order to be compromised. Access is enabled only when the token is connected and correct PIN is entered (see two-factor authentication). However, dongles can be used by anyone who can gain physical access to it. Newer technologies in hardware-based security solves this problem offering full proof security for data. Working off hardware-based security: A hardware device allows a user to log in, log out and set different levels through manual actions. The device uses biometric technology to prevent malicious users from logging in, logging out, and changing privilege levels. The current state of a user of the device is read by controllers in peripheral devices such as hard disks. Illegal access by a malicious user or a malicious program is interrupted based on the current state of a user by hard disk and DVD controllers making illegal access to data impossible. Hardware-based access control is more secure than protection provided by the operating systems as operating systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks by viruses and hackers. The data on hard disks can be corrupted after a malicious access is obtained. With hardware-based protection, software cannot manipulate the user privilege levels. It is impossible for a hacker or a malicious program to gain access to secure data protected by hardware or perform unauthorized privileged operations. This assumption is broken only if the hardware itself is malicious or contains a backdoor. The hardware protects the operating system image and file system privileges from being tampered. Therefore, a completely secure system can be created using a combination of hardware-based security and secure system administration policies. = Backups = Backups are used to ensure data which is lost can be recovered from another source. It is considered essential to keep a backup of any data in most industries and the process is recommended for any files of importance to a user.https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/Protect-yourself/Doing-things- safely/backups =Data masking= Data masking of structured data is the process of obscuring (masking) specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users (for example so banking customer representatives can only see the last 4 digits of a customers national identity number), developers (who need real production data to test new software releases but should not be able to see sensitive financial data), outsourcing vendors, etc. =Data erasure= Data erasure is a method of software based overwriting that completely wipes all electronic data residing on a hard drive or other digital media to ensure that no sensitive data is lost when an asset is retired or reused.  International laws and standards  = International laws = In the UK, the Data Protection Act is used to ensure that personal data is accessible to those whom it concerns, and provides redress to individuals if there are inaccuracies. This is particularly important to ensure individuals are treated fairly, for example for credit checking purposes. The Data Protection Act states that only individuals and companies with legitimate and lawful reasons can process personal information and cannot be shared. Data Privacy Day is an international holiday started by the Council of Europe that occurs every January 28. Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) became law on May 25, 2018, organizations may face significant penalties of up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of their annual revenue if they do not comply with the regulation.https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and- gdpr-penalties It is intended that GDPR will force organizations to understand their data privacy risks and take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure of consumers‚Äô private information. = International standards = The international standards ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002:2013 covers data security under the topic of information security, and one of its cardinal principles is that all stored information, i.e. data, should be owned so that it is clear whose responsibility it is to protect and control access to that data. The following are examples of organizations that help strengthen and standardize computing security: The Trusted Computing Group is an organization that helps standardize computing security technologies.

It was opened on March 18, 1965. The museum preserves historic buildings from Japan's Meiji (1867‚Äì1912), Taisho (1912‚Äì1926), and early Sh≈çwa (1926‚Äì1989) periods. Over 60 historical buildings have been moved and reconstructed onto of rolling hills alongside Lake Iruka. The most noteworthy building there is the reconstructed main entrance and lobby of Frank Lloyd Wright's landmark Imperial Hotel, which originally stood in Tokyo from 1923 to 1967, when the main structure was demolished to make way for a new, larger version of the hotel.Berstein, Fred A. \\"Near Nagoya, Architecture From When the East Looked West,\\" New York Times. April 2, 2006.  History  Main street of the village The Meiji era was a period of rapid change in Japan. After centuries of isolation, Japan began to incorporate ideas from the west, including building styles and construction techniques. Meiji-mura was started by Yoshir≈ç Taniguchi (Ë∞∑Âè£ ÂêâÈÉé Taniguchi Yoshir≈ç 1904‚Äì79), an architect, and Motoo Tsuchikawa (ÂúüÂ∑ùÂÖÉÂ§´ Tsuchikawa Moto-o, 1903‚Äì74), then vice president and later president of Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu). While riding the Yamanote line in Tokyo, Taniguchi lamented the sight of the demolition of the Rokumeikan, a symbol of Meiji era architecture. He appealed to his college classmate Tsuchikawa to join him in working to preserve western style Meiji era buildings of cultural or historical importance. On July 16, 1962 they formed a foundation for this purpose, with Nagoya Railroad providing the funding. Meiji-mura was opened on March 18, 1965 on the banks of the Lake Iruka reservoir, operated under Nagoya Railroad with Taniguchi as museum director, with 15 buildings. Meiji-mura's goal is to preserve these historic early examples of western architecture mixed with Japanese construction techniques and materials. Incidentally, many of the buildings were saved from demolition during the post World War II period, another time of transition and rapid progress in Japanese history. Though it is still operated by Nagoya Railroad, a subsidiary company was created in 2003 to oversee it and nearby Little World. Due to the recent financial declines with Nagoya Railroad the future of the park is in question. While renovations had been put on hold for a time, work on moving the Shibakawa Yashiki from Nishinomiya, Kobe was begun in January 2005.  Buildings  Notable buildings of historical or cultural importance including those of later eras are preserved, including a few Japanese style buildings. Nine of the buildings are designated as Important Cultural Assets, and nearly all the rest are registered as tangible cultural assets. The museum includes buildings from Hawaii and Seattle in the United States, and also Brazil. A steam locomotive and street car, along with shuttle buses and horse-drawn carriages, provide transportation within the grounds. An operational historic post office is included among the 67 buildings (as of 2005). Though some buildings are somewhat empty, others have displays showing the history of the building and period, period furniture, and other displays. The entrance and lobby of the Imperial Hotel was saved and moved from Tokyo between 1967 and 1985. Though only the entrance and lobby remain, it is the largest structure in Meiji Mura. Other structures preserved at Meiji Mura include Lafcadio Hearn's summer house from Shizuoka (1868), St. John's Church from Kyoto (1907) designed by James McDonald Gardiner and Kyoto's old St. Francis Xavier Catholic Cathedral (1890). The former cathedral is available to rent for weddings. One of the traditional merchant houses that survived from Nagoya is the T≈çmatsu House (Êù±ÊùæÂÆ∂‰ΩèÂÆÖ , T≈çmatsu-ka j≈´taku), which was constructed in 1901 in Funairi-ch≈ç, Nagoya. It survived the bombing of Nagoya in World War II and was relocated to the museum in the 1970s. It has been designated by the government as an Important Cultural Property.

Skin temperature trends do not necessarily reflect air temperature trends. NASA image by Robert Simmon, based on data from Joey Comiso, GSFC. Polar climatic temperature changes throughout the Cenozoic, showing glaciation of Antarctica toward the end of the Eocene, thawing near the end of the Oligocene and subsequent Miocene re-glaciation. The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the two polar ice caps of the Earth. It covers about 98% of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost and contains of ice. A cubic kilometer of ice weighs approximately one metric gigaton, meaning that the ice sheet weighs 26,500,000 gigatons. Approximately 61 percent of all fresh water on the Earth is held in the Antarctic ice sheet, an amount equivalent to about 58 m of sea-level rise. In East Antarctica, the ice sheet rests on a major land mass, while in West Antarctica the bed can extend to more than 2,500 m below sea level. Satellite measurements by NASA indicate a still increasing sheet thickness above the continent, outweighing the losses at the edge.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic- ice-sheet-greater-than-losses The reasons for this are not fully understood, but suggestions include the climatic effects on ocean and atmospheric circulation of the ozone hole, and/or cooler ocean surface temperatures as the warming deep waters melt the ice shelves. History The icing of Antarctica began in the middle Eocene about 45.5 million years agoSedimentological evidence for the formation of an East Antarctic ice sheet in Eocene/Oligocene time Palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, & palaeoecology ISSN 0031-0182, 1992, vol. 93, no1-2, pp. 85‚Äì112 (3 p.) and escalated during the Eocene‚ÄìOligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago. CO2 levels were then about 760 ppmNew CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation September 13th, 2009 and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation. The glaciation was favored by an interval when the Earth's orbit favored cool summers but oxygen isotope ratio cycle marker changes were too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone indicating an ice age of some size. The opening of the Drake Passage may have played a role as well though models of the changes suggest declining CO2 levels to have been more important. The Western Antarctic ice sheet declined somewhat during the warm early Pliocene epoch, approximately 5 to 3 million years ago; during this time the Ross Sea opened up. But there was no significant decline in the land-based Eastern Antarctic ice sheet. Changes since the late twentieth century =Temperature= According to a 2009 study, the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and significant at >0.05 ¬∞C/decade since 1957. West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 ¬∞C/decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica, this effect is restricted to the 1980s and 1990s. =Sea ice and land ice= Visualization of NASA's mission Operation IceBridge dataset BEDMAP2, obtained with laser and ice-penetrating radar, collecting surface height, bedrock topography and ice thickness. The bedrock topography of Antarctica, critical to understand dynamic motion of the continental ice sheets. Ice enters the sheet through precipitation as snow. This snow is then compacted to form glacier ice which moves under gravity towards the coast. Most of it is carried to the coast by fast moving ice streams. The ice then passes into the ocean, often forming vast floating ice shelves. These shelves then melt or calve off to give icebergs that eventually melt. If the transfer of the ice from the land to the sea is balanced by snow falling back on the land then there will be no net contribution to global sea levels. The general trend shows that a warming climate in the southern hemisphere would transport more moisture to Antarctica, causing the interior ice sheets to grow, while calving events along the coast will increase, causing these areas to shrink. A 2006 paper derived from satellite data, measuring changes in the gravity of the ice mass, suggests that the total amount of ice in Antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few years. A 2008 study compared the ice leaving the ice sheet, by measuring the ice velocity and thickness along the coast, to the amount of snow accumulation over the continent. This found that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was in balance but the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was losing mass. This was largely due to acceleration of ice streams such as Pine Island Glacier. These results agree closely with the gravity changes. An estimate published in November 2012 and based on the GRACE data as well as on an improved glacial isostatic adjustment model discussed systematic uncertainty in the estimates, and by studying 26 separate regions, estimated an average yearly mass loss of from 2002 to 2010 (a sea-level rise of ). The mass loss was geographically uneven, mainly occurring along the Amundsen Sea coast, while the West Antarctic Ice Sheet mass was roughly constant and the East Antarctic Ice Sheet gained in mass. Antarctic sea ice anomalies have roughly followed the pattern of warming, with the greatest declines occurring off the coast of West Antarctica. East Antarctica sea ice has been increasing since 1978, though not at a statistically significant rate. The atmospheric warming has been directly linked to the mass losses in West Antarctica of the first decade of the twenty-first century. This mass loss is more likely to be due to increased melting of the ice shelves because of changes in ocean circulation patterns (which themselves may be linked to atmospheric circulation changes that may also explain the warming trends in West Antarctica). Melting of the ice shelves in turn causes the ice streams to speed up. The melting and disappearance of the floating ice shelves will only have a small effect on sea level, which is due to salinity differences.Peter Noerdlinger, PHYSORG.COM \\"Melting of Floating Ice Will Raise Sea Level\\" The most important consequence of their increased melting is the speed up of the ice streams on land which are buttressed by these ice shelves. = Recent observations = A group of scientists with the University of California updated previous results ranging from 1979 to 2017, which improved time series for more accurate results. Their article, published January 2019, covered four decades of information in Antarctica, revealing the total mass loss which increased gradually per decade. 40 ¬± 9 Gt/y from 1979 to 1990, 50 ¬± 14 Gt/y from 1989 to 2000, 166 ¬±18 Gt/y from 1999 to 2009 and finally 252 ¬±26 Gt/y from 2009 to 2017. The majority of mass loss was in the Amundsen Sea sector, which experienced loss as high as 159 ¬±8 Gt/y. There are areas which have not experienced much loss at all, such as East Ross ice shelf. This improved study revealed an acceleration of near 280% over the span of four decades. The study questions previous hypotheses, such as the belief that the heavy melt began in the 1940s to 1970s, suggesting that more recent anthropogenic actions have caused accelerated melt.

Such L-functions are called 'global', in that they are defined as Euler products in terms of local zeta functions. They form one of the two major classes of global L-functions, the other being the L-functions associated to automorphic representations. Conjecturally, there is just one essential type of global L-function, with two descriptions (coming from an algebraic variety, coming from an automorphic representation); this would be a vast generalisation of the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture, itself a very deep and recent result () in number theory. The description of the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function up to finitely many factors of its Euler product is relatively simple. This follows the initial suggestions of Helmut Hasse and Andr√© Weil, motivated by the case in which V is a single point, and the Riemann zeta function results. Taking the case of K the rational number field Q, and V a non-singular projective variety, we can for almost all prime numbers p consider the reduction of V modulo p, an algebraic variety Vp over the finite field Fp with p elements, just by reducing equations for V. Again for almost all p it will be non-singular. We define :Z_{V,Q}(s) to be the Dirichlet series of the complex variable s, which is the infinite product of the local zeta functions :\\\\zeta_{V,p}\\\\left(p^{-s}\\\\right). Then Z(s), according to our definition, is well-defined only up to multiplication by rational functions in a finite number of p^{-s}. Since the indeterminacy is relatively harmless, and has meromorphic continuation everywhere, there is a sense in which the properties of Z(s) do not essentially depend on it. In particular, while the exact form of the functional equation for Z(s), reflecting in a vertical line in the complex plane, will definitely depend on the 'missing' factors, the existence of some such functional equation does not. A more refined definition became possible with the development of √©tale cohomology; this neatly explains what to do about the missing, 'bad reduction' factors. According to general principles visible in ramification theory, 'bad' primes carry good information (theory of the conductor). This manifests itself in the √©tale theory in the Ogg‚ÄìN√©ron‚ÄìShafarevich criterion for good reduction; namely that there is good reduction, in a definite sense, at all primes p for which the Galois representation œÅ on the √©tale cohomology groups of V is unramified. For those, the definition of local zeta function can be recovered in terms of the characteristic polynomial of :\\\\rho(\\\\operatorname{Frob}(p)), Frob(p) being a Frobenius element for p. What happens at the ramified p is that œÅ is non- trivial on the inertia group I(p) for p. At those primes the definition must be 'corrected', taking the largest quotient of the representation œÅ on which the inertia group acts by the trivial representation. With this refinement, the definition of Z(s) can be upgraded successfully from 'almost all' p to all p participating in the Euler product. The consequences for the functional equation were worked out by Serre and Deligne in the later 1960s; the functional equation itself has not been proved in general. Example: elliptic curve over Q Let E be an elliptic curve over Q of conductor N. Then, E has good reduction at all primes p not dividing N, it has multiplicative reduction at the primes p that exactly divide N (i.e. such that p divides N, but p2 does not; this is written p  N), and it has additive reduction elsewhere (i.e. at the primes where p2 divides N). The Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function of E then takes the form :Z_{E,\\\\mathbf Q}(s)= \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)\\\\zeta(s-1)}{L(s,E)}. \\\\, Here, Œ∂(s) is the usual Riemann zeta function and L(s, E) is called the L-function of E/Q, which takes the formSection C.16 of :L(s,E)=\\\\prod_pL_p(s,E)^{-1}\\\\, where, for a given prime p, :L_p(s,E)=\\\\begin{cases} (1-a_pp^{-s}+p^{1-2s}), & \\\\text{if } p mid N \\\\\\\\\\\\ (1-a_pp^{-s}), & \\\\text{if }p\\\\mid N \\\\text{ and } p^2 mid N \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1, & \\\\text{if }p^2\\\\mid N \\\\end{cases} where, in the case of good reduction ap is p + 1 ‚àí (number of points of E mod p), and in the case of multiplicative reduction ap is ¬±1 depending on whether E has split or non- split multiplicative reduction at p. Hasse‚ÄìWeil conjecture The Hasse‚ÄìWeil conjecture states that the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function should extend to a meromorphic function for all complex s, and should satisfy a functional equation similar to that of the Riemann zeta function. For elliptic curves over the rational numbers, the Hasse‚ÄìWeil conjecture follows from the modularity theorem. See also *Arithmetic zeta function References Bibliography *J.-P.

It is classified by the Vaughan Williams classification system as class Ia; thus it is a sodium channel blocker of cardiomyocytes. In addition to blocking the INa current, it inhibits the IKr rectifier K+ current. Procainamide is also known to induce a voltage-dependent open channel block on the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels in cardiomyocytes. Uses =Medical = Procainamide is used for treating ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular ectopy and tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, and re-entrant and automatic supraventricular tachycardia. For example, it can be used to convert new-onset atrial fibrillation, though it is suboptimal for this purpose. It is administered by mouth, by intramuscular injection, or intravenously. =Others= It has been also been used as a chromatography resin because it somewhat binds protein. Side effects  There are many side effects following the induction of procainamide. These adverse effects are ventricular dysrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension and shock. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. Procainamide may also lead to drug fever and other allergic responses. There is also a chance that drug- induced lupus erythematosus occurs, which at the same time leads to arthralgia, myalgia and pleurisy. Most of these side effects may occur due to the acetylation of procainamide. =Toxicity= There is a close line between the plasma concentrations of the therapeutic and toxic effect, therefore a high risk for toxicity. Many symptoms resemble systemic lupus erythematosus because procainamide reactivates hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites, which bind to histone proteins and are toxic to lymphocytes. The hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites are also toxic to bone marrow cells and can cause agranulocytosis. These metabolites are formed due to the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These leukocytes release myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide, which oxidize the primary aromatic amine of procainamide to form procainamide hydroxylamine. The release of hydrogen peroxide is also called a respiratory burst, which occurs for procainamide in monocytes but not in lymphocytes. Furthermore, the metabolites can be formed by activated neutrophils. These metabolites could then bind to their cell membranes and cause a release of autoantibodies which would react with the neutrophils. Procainamide hydroxylamine has more cytotoxicity by hindering the response of lymphocytes to T-cell and B-cell mitogens. Hydroxylamine can also generate methemoglobin, a protein that could hinder further oxygen exchange. It was also detected that the antiarrhythmic drug procainamide interferes with pacemakers. A toxic level of procainamide leads to decrease in ventricular conduction velocity and increase of the ventricular refractory period. This results in a disturbance in the artificial membrane potential and leads to a supraventricular tachycardia which induces failure of the pacemaker and death. Thus, it prolongs QT interval of action potential and increases the risk of torsade de pointes. Procainamide could initiate leukopenia and/or agranulocytosis, which are serious hematologic disorders, and is also known for causing gastrointestinal disturbances and aggravating pre-existing abnormalities in impulse initiation and propagation. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Procainamide works as an anti-arrhythmic agent and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result from the loss of voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. Procainamide slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced. =Metabolism= Procainamide is metabolized via different pathways. The most common one is the acetylation of procainamide to the less-toxic N-acetylprocainamide. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. There are two phenotypes that result from the acetylation process, namely the slow and rapid acetylator. Procainamide can also be oxidized by the cytochrome P-450 to a reactive oxide metabolite. But it seems that acetylation of the nitrogen group of procainamide decrease the amount of the chemical that would be available for the oxidative route. Other metabolites of procainamide include desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide, desethylprocainamide, p-aminobenzoic acid, which are excreted via the urine. N-acetyl-4-aminobenzoic acid as well as N-acetyl-3-hydroxyprocainamide, N-acetylprocainamide-N-oxide and N-acetyl-4-aminohippuric acid are also metabolites of procainamide. Chemistry 4-amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide (also known as para- amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide because the amino substituent is attached to the para-position, Arene substitution patterns of the benzene ring) is a synthetic organic compound with the chemical formula C13-H21-N3-O. Procainamide is structurally similar to procaine, but in place of an ester group, procainamide contains an amide group. This substitution is the reason why procainamide exhibits a longer half-life time than procaine. Procainamide belongs to the aminobenzamides. These are aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives consisting of an amide with a benzamide moiety and a triethylamine attached to the amide nitrogen. In certain lines, the para-amino group might become a target site to attach further paraphernalia, e.g. ref. Ex18 in . History Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950, under the brand name \\"Pronestyl\\". It was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1951. Due to the loss of Indonesia in World War II, the source for cinchona alkaloids, a precursor of quinidine, was reduced. This led to research for a new antiarrhythmic drug. As a result, procaine was discovered, which has similar cardiac effects as quinidine. In 1936 it was found by Mautz that by applying it directly on the myocardium, the ventricular threshold for electrical stimulation was elevated. This mechanism is responsible for the antiarrhythmic effect. However, due to the short duration of action, caused by rapid enzymatic hydrolysis, its therapeutic applications were limited. In addition, procaine also caused tremors and respiratory depression. All these adverse features stimulated the search for an alternative to procaine. Studies were done on various congeners and metabolites and this ultimately led to the discovery of procainamide by Mark et al. It was found that procainamide was effective for treating ventricular arrhythmias, but it had the same toxicity profile as quinidine, and it could cause systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. These negative characteristics slowed the search for new antiarrhythmics based on the chemical structure of procainamide. In 1970 only five drugs were reported. These were the cardiac glycosides, quinidine, propranolol, lidocaine and diphenylhydantoin.

Many related plants also share the name \\"daisy\\", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy. Historically, it has also been commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys). Bellis perennis is native to western, central and northern Europe, including remote islands such as the Faroe Islands but widely naturalised in most temperate regions including the AmericasPLANTS Profile., \\"Bellis perennis L. lawndaisy\\", USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=bepe2 and Australasia. Description It is a perennial herbaceous plant with short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 3/4 to 2 inches (approx. 2‚Äì5 cm) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing ‚Äì hence the term 'lawn daisy'. It exhibits the phenomenon of heliotropism where the flowers follow the position of the sun in the sky. The flowerheads are composite, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers about 3/4 to 1-1/4 in (approx. 2‚Äì3 cm) in diameter, with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on single leafless stems 3/4 ‚Äì 4 in (approx. 2‚Äì10 cm), rarely 6 in (approx. 15 cm) tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as \\"phyllaries\\". The achenes are without pappus.Parnell, J. and Curtis. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press Cultivation Bellis perennis generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal conditions, it has a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters. It can generally be grown in USDA Zones 4 ‚Äì 8 (i.e. where minimum temperatures are above ) in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires low or no maintenance. It has no known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained soils. The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after flowering. Though not native to the United States, the species is still considered a valuable ground cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as well as spring meadows where low growth and some color is desired in parallel with minimal care and maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised). Numerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or spherical blooms in a range of sizes (1 cm to 6 cm) and colours (red, pink & white). They are generally grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in Spring. It has been reported to be mostly self- fertilizing, but some plants may be self-sterile. Etymology Well-trodden meadow at Kew Gardens, the grass white with daisies Bellis may come from bellus, Latin for \\"pretty\\", and perennis is Latin for \\"everlasting\\". The name \\"daisy\\" is considered a corruption of \\"day's eye\\", because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. Chaucer called it \\"eye of the day\\". In Medieval times, Bellis perennis or the English Daisy was commonly known as \\"Mary's Rose\\".The Plant-Lore and Garden-Craft of Shakespeare, by Henry Nicholson Ellacombe. W. Satchell and Company, London, 1884 It is also known as bone flower. The English Daisy is also considered to be a flower of children and innocence.\\"Daisy.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed., 2011.

Flower buds and petals can be eaten raw in sandwiches, soups and salads. It is also used as a tea and as a vitamin supplement. =Herbal medicine= Bellis perennis has astringent properties and has been used in herbal medicine.Howard, Michael. Traditional Folk Remedies (Century, 1987), p129 In ancient Rome, the surgeons who accompanied Roman legions into battle would order their slaves to pick sacks full of daisies in order to extract their juice; bellum, Latin for \\"war\\", may be the origin of this plant's scientific name. Bandages were soaked in this juice and would then be used to bind sword and spear cuts. Bellis perennis is still used in homeopathy for wounds and after certain surgical procedures, as well as for blunt trauma in animals. Typically, the plant is harvested while in flower when intended for use in homeopathy. Bellis perennis flowers have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea (or the leaves as a salad) for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. =Other uses= Daisies have traditionally been used for making daisy chains in children's games.

This allows passengers on two consecutive floors to be able to use the elevator simultaneously, significantly increasing the passenger capacity of an elevator shaft. Such a scheme can improve efficiency in buildings where the volume of traffic would normally have a single elevator stopping at every floor. For example, a passenger may board the lower deck (which serves only odd-numbered floors) on the concourse level while another passenger may board the upper deck (which serves even-numbered floors) on the ground floor. The cab serving even floors is actually on top of the cab serving odd floors in the same elevator shaft. When passengers disembark from the even-floor serving cab at level 30, for instance, the passengers in the odd-floor serving cab beneath it (level 29) are simultaneously exiting. Architecturally, this is important as double-deck elevators occupy less building core space than traditional single-deck elevators do for the same level of traffic. In skyscrapers, this allows for much more efficient use of space as the floor area required by elevators tends to be quite significant. The other main technique is shared-shaft elevators where multiple elevators use different sections of the same shaft to serve different floors with skylobbies separating the sections. The Thyssenkrupp TWIN elevator places 2 independent elevator cabs in 1 shaft and the Thyssenkrupp MULTI system places several elevator cabs in one shaft - each cab is equipped with its own, independent linear motor and can move vertically but also horizontally from one shaft to another.https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/12/13/thyssenkrupp-multi- elevator-goes-up-down- sideways.htmlhttps://www.wired.co.uk/article/thyssenkrupp-multi-maglev- elevator Double-deck goods/passenger elevators Mori Tower: Lower lobby for odd-numbered floors, upper lobby for even-numbered floors Not all double-deck elevators are used to transport passengers simultaneously in both decks. Sometimes one or more elevators in a building has a double-deck car, where the second deck is used for transportation of goods, typically outside of peak traffic periods. This technique has the advantages of preventing damage to interior fixtures due to impact from trolleys, and does not require a dedicated shaft solely devoted to a goods-only elevator car. During peak periods, the car is switched back to passenger mode, where it can expedite passenger movement into or out of the building. As of 2011, no triple-deck elevators have been built, although such a design had been considered for the 163-floor Burj Khalifa before the final design was scaled back to double-deck. Also, Frank Lloyd Wright had envisioned five-deck elevators in his 1956 proposed Mile High Illinois.

It has seen several editions since its introduction in 1984, the most recent, Mekton Zeta („É°„ÇØ„Éà„É≥ Z; a reference to the seminal mecha anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam) being first published in 1994. Mekton was the first anime role-playing game available in North America; the anime influence was muted compared to later editions, but this is in parallel with North America's growing exposure to and awareness of anime in general. The use of katakana to represent the title of the game begins with the \\"Zeta\\" edition and may or may not be carried over into future editions. A \\"fourth edition,\\" usually referred to as Mekton Double Zeta and assumed to be using the Fuzion System rules (Mekton II and Mekton Z use the older Interlock System), has been rumored to be in development by publishers R. Talsorian Games since 1997. According to designer Mike Pondsmith, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the introduction of a new edition is a lack of a true \\"generic\\" pre-made campaign setting for the game. Mekton is a moderately supported system (though no new official material has been released since 1996), with a very active albeit small fanbase, centered on the Mekton Zeta Mailing List, an ezmlm based mailing list active since the fall of 1996. The intricate detail of the mecha that can be built in Mekton is both the game's biggest strength and biggest drawback; while nearly anything can be built with the game's construction system, from personal armor to gigantic spaceships, it is very time-consuming and can make it nearly impossible to play a quick \\"pick-up\\" game. Within the context of the RPG, mecha are referred to as \\"mektons,\\" abbreviated as \\"meks\\" and sometimes alternately called \\"suits\\" (as in \\"power suits\\" or power armor). Several official settings have been published. Mekton II is an important historical artifact in that it was among the first RPG books to use the then-new technique of desktop publishing. Mekton Zeta has a more pronounced anime influence than the previous two editions; the full cover title of this edition if read in Japanese and translated into English reads \\"Super Dimension Mobile Warrior Mekton Z\\", the title of the game referring to both Macross (The Super Dimension Fortress Macross) and Gundam (Mobile Suit Gundam). History Mike Pondsmith decided to self-publish a game which originated in his interest in the Mobile Suit Gundam manga which he combined with the Imperial Star game system, which he had designed for his own amusement: the result was the \\"white box edition\\" of Mekton (1984), a game of giant robot combat. Mekton was designed by Pondsmith and Mike Jones and published as a boxed set with a 32-page book, a large color map, two cardstock counter sheets, and dice. Pondsmith founded R. Talsorian Games in 1985, then put out a second edition of Mekton (1986) through the new company; the game was now packaged as a 100-page rulebook rather than a box. The second edition rulebook also included counters and two maps. Mekton II (1987) ‚Äì the third edition of the game ‚Äì made use of the company's Interlock System. Mekton II was designed by Pondsmith and published as a 96-page book, and included art by Ben Dunn. Mekton received a fourth edition called Mekton Zeta (1994). R. Talsorian published a reprint of that game as the ANimechaniX- branded Mekton Zeta (2000). Contents The first edition of Mekton was a science-fiction system of combat between giant robots, drawing on Japanese animation for inspiration - the first of its type. The second edition from 1985 would add basic role-playing rules. The game covers character and robot construction and combat, including a boardgame-combat-resolution system, plus historical background for the world of Algol and an introductory scenario. Mekton II is a complete revision of the original Mekton rules, including expanded character generation and political info on Algol. This version is compatible with Cyberpunk. Editions of Mekton * \\"White Box\\" Mekton (1984) - not a role-playing game, rather a boxed tactical war-game including counters and maps. * Mekton (1985) - softcover book using a custom percentile-based task resolution system. Notable for having misspelled its own name in the katakana. ** Roadstriker (1986) - rules for human-scale transformable vehicles and power suit mecha, more advanced transformable mecha design options, and a police drama adventure * Mekton II (1987) - converted Mekton to run on the Interlock System, later used in Cyberpunk 2020. Cover art by Ben Dunn. ** Roadstriker II (1990) - rules for human-scale transformable vehicles and power suit mecha, more advanced transformable mecha design options, and a police drama adventure converted to the Mekton II system. ** Operation Rimfire (ca. 1990) - campaign book. A very Gundam-esque adventure in which representatives of both major political factions on Algol are sent on a long-range interplanetary mission to determine the nature of an anomaly at the edge of the star system. Written to be played as 'episodes' in a 'series'. (Reference was made in this book and the later Mekton Empire that the anomaly was in actuality a nonfunctional stargate such as is used in the Bendarian Empire.) ** Mekton Techbook/Mekton Technical System (MTB/MTS) (1991) - a major conversion of the mecha-building system of Mekton ** Mekton Empire - This expansion book reduced the Algol system to just one more star among hundreds in the Bendarian Galactic Empire. * Mekton Zeta („É°„ÇØ„Éà„É≥ Z) (1994) - general update and improvement of Mekton II ** Mekton Zeta Plus („É°„ÇØ„Éà„É≥ Z „Éó„É©„Çπ) (1994) - general update and improvement of the Mekton Techbook *Gundam Senki (2000) - Japanese language Mobile Suit Gundam RPG using the Mekton system. Scheduled for US release, release date unspecified at this time. *Mekton Zero (TBA) - crowdfunded project, on indefinite hiatus after being delayed for five years. Official settings * Algol - A \\"grab bag\\" setting in an alternate universe, mixing many different styles of anime together. This setting originated with the first edition of Mekton, and was continued in the well-received expansion book Operation: Rimfire. Algol was the default setting for Mekton and Mekton II (as well as Operation: Rimfire and Landstriker), and remains in Mekton Z for legacy purposes (as well as getting a passing reference in Mekton Empire). Algol is a long-lost human colony of the Bendar Galactic Empire, where the various factions are locked in a cold war and must deal with an impending ice age and the possible return of their ancient alien enemy, the fearsome Aggendi lizard warriors. The Algol Mailing List continued development on Algol into the early 2000s. If there is a 'default' campaign setting for Mekton, this is it. * Mekton Empire - A space opera setting taking hints from Captain Harlock, Gundam and Voltron, set in the distant Bendar Spiral Galaxy. It added rules for playing aliens (including non-humanoids), space combat, psionics and creating new alien creatures. * Jovian Chronicles - A heavily Gundam-inspired licensed setting created by Dream Pod 9, set in the 23rd Century. This would later become a separate game using Dream Pod 9's Silhouette System. * Invasion Terra - A Macross-like setting in the future of 2105. * Imperial Star - Very similar to Mekton Empire but set in the Milky Way Galaxy. This is considered as close to a 'default' campaign setting for Mekton Zeta as exists. * Quicksilver Blues - Unreleased as of 2004 (complete since at least 2000). As of 2005, Quicksilver Blues is being reworked into a new and separate role- playing game called \\"Era¬≥\\" by its original developers, Atomic Rocket Games. * Starblade Battalion - A Gundam-like setting, set in the far future of the Cyberpunk 2020 world (AD 2180). Reception Allen Varney reviewed Mekton in Space Gamer No. 72. Varney commented that \\"its slick appearance and novel topic will sucker any Japanese-robot fan who can't wait for one of the other robot games due out soon. Pass the word.\\" David Jacobs reviewed HIL Sector Blues in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 79. Jacobs commented that \\"Even if you've seen all of the Japanese animation featuring giant robots, I strongly suggest that you at least give it a once-over, because these guys and gals at R.

In chemistry, photoisomerization is a form of isomerization induced by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerizations are known. The term \\"photoisomerization\\" usually, however, refers to a reversible process. Applications Photoisomerization of the retinal eye allows for vision. Photoisomerizable substrates have been put to practical use, for instance, in pigments for rewritable CDs, DVDs, and 3D optical data storage solutions. In addition, interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches, molecular motors, and molecular electronics. Another class of device that uses the photoisomerization process is as an additive in liquid crystals to change their linear and nonlinear properties. Due to the photoisomerization is possible to induce a molecular reorientation in the liquid crystal bulk, which is used in holography, as spatial filter or optical switching. Methyl red molecule. A common azo-dye used in liquid crystal doping. Examples Azobenzenes, stilbenes, spiropyrans, are prominent classes of compounds subject to photoisomerism. :Photoisomerization of norbornadiene to quadricyclane. In the presence of a catalyst, norbornadiene converts to quadricyclane via ~300nm UV radiation . When converted back to norbornadiene, quadryicyclane‚Äôs ring strain energy is liberated in the form of heat (ŒîH = ‚àí89 kJ/mol). This reaction has been proposed to store solar energy (photoswitchs). Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are trans-cis (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include stilbene and azobenzene. This type of compounds has a double bond, and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include fulgide and diarylethene. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the di-pi-methane rearrangement. Coordination chemistry Many complexes are often photosensitive and many of these complexes undergo photoisomerization. One case is the conversion of the colorless cis-bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum chloride to the yellow trans isomer. Photoisomerization of PtCl2(PPh3)2. Some coordination complexes undergo change in their spin state upon illumination, i.e. these are photosensitive spin crossover complexes.

Central part shows the pulsar wind nebula, with the red star in the centre being the Crab Pulsar. Image combines optical data from Hubble (in red) and X-ray data from Chandra (in blue). A pulsar wind nebula (PWN, plural PWNe), sometimes called a plerion (derived from the Greek \\"œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ\\", pleres, meaning \\"full\\"), is a type of nebula found inside the shells of supernova remnants (SNRe) that is powered by pulsar winds generated by its central pulsar. These nebulae were discovered in 1976 as small depressions at radio wavelengths near the centre of supernova remnants. They have since been found to be X-ray emitters and are possibly gamma ray sources. Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae Processes creating pulsar wind nebulae are complicated and they evolve through various phases before creating a so-called relic nebula, which is visible as a wind bubble, shell nebula, or as a bow-shock. New plerions appear within the first few thousands of years of a pulsar's creation, and often look like a series of shells inside the supernova remnant, for example the small pulsar wind nebula within the inner region of the Crab Nebula, or the nebula within the large Vela Supernova Remnant and its associated Vela Pulsar. As the plerion ages, the nebulosity of the supernova remnant dissipates and disappears. Over time, pulsar wind nebulae may change in behaviour and become relic nebulae surrounding millisecond radio pulsars or even older and slower rotating pulsars. Plerions are estimated to last around 15,000 years, after which the shell dissipates as the energies from the pulsar decreases and they are no longer detectable. Importantly, this depends on the rate of energy lost by the pulsar as its spin rate slows, which varies among the known pulsars. Properties of pulsar wind nebulae Pulsar winds are composed of charged particles (plasma) accelerated to relativistic speeds by the rapidly rotating, hugely powerful magnetic fields above that are generated by the spinning pulsar. The pulsar wind often streams into the surrounding interstellar medium, creating a standing shock wave called the 'wind termination shock', where matter is decelerated to sub-relativistic speed. Beyond this radius, synchrotron emission increases in the magnetized flow. These processes can switch on and off with many reversals, and this creates the numerous visible shells centred on the pulsar. Pulsar wind nebulae often show the following properties: * An increasing brightness towards the center, without a shell-like structure as seen in most other supernova remnants. * A highly polarized flux and a flat spectral index in the radio band, Œ±=0‚Äì0.3. The index steepens at X-ray energies due to synchrotron radiation losses and on the average has an X-ray photon index of 1.3‚Äì2.3 (spectral index of 2.3‚Äì3.3). * An X-ray size that is generally smaller than their radio and optical size (due to smaller synchrotron lifetimes of the higher-energy electrons). * A photon index at TeV gamma-ray energies of ~2.3. Pulsar wind nebulae can be powerful probes of a pulsar/neutron star's interaction with its surroundings. Their unique properties can be used to infer the geometry, energetics, and composition of the pulsar wind, the space velocity of the pulsar itself, and the properties of the ambient medium.

Introduction Understanding the consequences of supersymmetry has proven mathematically daunting, and it has likewise been difficult to develop theories that could account for symmetry breaking, i.e., the lack of observed partner particles of equal mass. To make progress on these problems, physicists developed supersymmetric quantum mechanics, an application of the supersymmetry (SUSY) superalgebra to quantum mechanics as opposed to quantum field theory. It was hoped that studying SUSY's consequences in this simpler setting would lead to new understanding; remarkably, the effort created new areas of research in quantum mechanics itself. For example, students are typically taught to \\"solve\\" the hydrogen atom by a laborious process which begins by inserting the Coulomb potential into the Schr√∂dinger equation. After a considerable amount of work using many differential equations, the analysis produces a recursion relation for the Laguerre polynomials. The final outcome is the spectrum of hydrogen-atom energy states (labeled by quantum numbers n and l). Using ideas drawn from SUSY, the final result can be derived with significantly greater ease, in much the same way that operator methods are used to solve the harmonic oscillator. A similar supersymmetric approach can also be used to more accurately find the hydrogen spectrum using the Dirac equation.Thaller, B. (1992). The Dirac Equation. Texts and Monographs in Physics. Springer. Oddly enough, this approach is analogous to the way Erwin Schr√∂dinger first solved the hydrogen atom. Of course, he did not call his solution supersymmetric, as SUSY was thirty years in the future. The SUSY solution of the hydrogen atom is only one example of the very general class of solutions which SUSY provides to shape- invariant potentials, a category which includes most potentials taught in introductory quantum mechanics courses. SUSY quantum mechanics involves pairs of Hamiltonians which share a particular mathematical relationship, which are called partner Hamiltonians. (The potential energy terms which occur in the Hamiltonians are then called partner potentials.) An introductory theorem shows that for every eigenstate of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy (except possibly for zero energy eigenstates). This fact can be exploited to deduce many properties of the eigenstate spectrum. It is analogous to the original description of SUSY, which referred to bosons and fermions. We can imagine a \\"bosonic Hamiltonian\\", whose eigenstates are the various bosons of our theory. The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be \\"fermionic\\", and its eigenstates would be the theory's fermions. Each boson would have a fermionic partner of equal energy‚Äîbut, in the relativistic world, energy and mass are interchangeable, so we can just as easily say that the partner particles have equal mass. SUSY concepts have provided useful extensions to the WKB approximation in the form of a modified version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. In addition, SUSY has been applied to non-quantum statistical mechanics through the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation, showing that even if the original inspiration in high-energy particle physics turns out to be a blind alley, its investigation has brought about many useful benefits. Example: the harmonic oscillator The Schr√∂dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator takes the form :H^{HO} \\\\psi_{n}(x) = \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+\\\\frac{m \\\\omega^{2}}{2}x^{2}\\\\bigg) \\\\psi_{n}(x) = E_{n}^{HO} \\\\psi_{n}(x), where \\\\psi_{n}(x) is the nth energy eigenstate of H^{HO} with energy E_{n}^{HO}. We want to find an expression for E_{n}^{HO} in terms of n. We define the operators :A = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}}\\\\frac{d}{dx}+W(x) and :A^{\\\\dagger} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}}\\\\frac{d}{dx}+W(x), where W(x), which we need to choose, is called the superpotential of H^{HO}. We also define the aforementioned partner Hamiltonians H^{(1)} and H^{(2)} as :H^{(1)} = A^{\\\\dagger} A = \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}} W^{\\\\prime}(x) + W^{2}(x) :H^{(2)} = A A^{\\\\dagger} = \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}} W^{\\\\prime}(x) + W^{2}(x). A zero energy ground state \\\\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) of H^{(1)} would satisfy the equation :H^{(1)} \\\\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) = A^{\\\\dagger} A \\\\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) = A^{\\\\dagger} \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}}\\\\frac{d}{dx}+ W(x)\\\\bigg) \\\\psi_{0}^{(1)}(x) = 0. Assuming that we know the ground state of the harmonic oscillator \\\\psi_{0}(x), we can solve for W(x) as :W(x) = \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar}{\\\\sqrt{2m}} \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\psi_{0}^{\\\\prime}(x)}{\\\\psi_{0}(x)}\\\\bigg) = x \\\\sqrt{m \\\\omega^{2}/2} We then find that :H^{(1)} = \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\\\frac{m \\\\omega^{2}}{2} x^{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{2} :H^{(2)} = \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\\\frac{m \\\\omega^{2}}{2} x^{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{2}. We can now see that :H^{(1)} = H^{(2)} - \\\\hbar \\\\omega = H^{HO} - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{2}. This is a special case of shape invariance, discussed below. Taking without proof the introductory theorem mentioned above, it is apparent that the spectrum of H^{(1)} will start with E_{0} = 0 and continue upwards in steps of \\\\hbar \\\\omega. The spectra of H^{(2)} and H^{HO} will have the same even spacing, but will be shifted up by amounts \\\\hbar \\\\omega and \\\\hbar \\\\omega / 2, respectively. It follows that the spectrum of H^{HO} is therefore the familiar E_{n}^{HO} = \\\\hbar \\\\omega (n + 1/2). The SUSY QM superalgebra In fundamental quantum mechanics, we learn that an algebra of operators is defined by commutation relations among those operators. For example, the canonical operators of position and momentum have the commutator [x,p]=i. (Here, we use \\"natural units\\" where Planck's constant is set equal to 1.) A more intricate case is the algebra of angular momentum operators; these quantities are closely connected to the rotational symmetries of three-dimensional space. To generalize this concept, we define an anticommutator, which relates operators the same way as an ordinary commutator, but with the opposite sign: :\\\\\\\\{A,B\\\\\\\\} = AB + BA. If operators are related by anticommutators as well as commutators, we say they are part of a Lie superalgebra. Let's say we have a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{H} and a set of N operators Q_i. We shall call this system supersymmetric if the following anticommutation relation is valid for all i,j = 1,\\\\ldots,N: :\\\\\\\\{Q_i,Q^\\\\dagger_j\\\\\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\delta_{ij}. If this is the case, then we call Q_i the system's supercharges.  Example  Let's look at the example of a one-dimensional nonrelativistic particle with a 2D (i.e., two states) internal degree of freedom called \\"spin\\" (it's not really spin because \\"real\\" spin is a property of 3D particles). Let b be an operator which transforms a \\"spin up\\" particle into a \\"spin down\\" particle. Its adjoint b^\\\\dagger then transforms a spin down particle into a spin up particle; the operators are normalized such that the anticommutator \\\\\\\\{b,b^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=1. And of course, b^2=0. Let p be the momentum of the particle and x be its position with [x,p]=i. Let W (the \\"superpotential\\") be an arbitrary complex analytic function of x and define the supersymmetric operators :Q_1=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[(p-iW)b+(p+iW^\\\\dagger)b^\\\\dagger\\\\right] :Q_2=\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\left[(p-iW)b-(p+iW^\\\\dagger)b^\\\\dagger\\\\right] Note that Q_1 and Q_2 are self-adjoint. Let the Hamiltonian :H=\\\\\\\\{Q_1,Q_1\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{Q_2,Q_2\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{(p+\\\\Im\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\})^2}{2}+\\\\frac{{\\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\}}^2}{2}+\\\\frac{\\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\}'}{2}(bb^\\\\dagger-b^\\\\dagger b) where W' is the derivative of W. Also note that {Q1,Q2}=0. This is nothing other than N = 2 supersymmetry. Note that \\\\Im\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\} acts like an electromagnetic vector potential. Let's also call the spin down state \\"bosonic\\" and the spin up state \\"fermionic\\". This is only in analogy to quantum field theory and should not be taken literally. Then, Q1 and Q2 maps \\"bosonic\\" states into \\"fermionic\\" states and vice versa. Let's reformulate this a bit: Define :Q=(p-iW)b and of course, :Q^\\\\dagger=(p+iW^\\\\dagger)b^\\\\dagger :\\\\\\\\{Q,Q\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{Q^\\\\dagger,Q^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=0 and :\\\\\\\\{Q^\\\\dagger,Q\\\\\\\\}=2H An operator is \\"bosonic\\" if it maps \\"bosonic\\" states to \\"bosonic\\" states and \\"fermionic\\" states to \\"fermionic\\" states. An operator is \\"fermionic\\" if it maps \\"bosonic\\" states to \\"fermionic\\" states and vice versa. Any operator can be expressed uniquely as the sum of a bosonic operator and a fermionic operator. Define the supercommutator [,} as follows: Between two bosonic operators or a bosonic and a fermionic operator, it is none other than the commutator but between two fermionic operators, it is an anticommutator. Then, x and p are bosonic operators and b, b^\\\\dagger, Q and Q^\\\\dagger are fermionic operators. Let's work in the Heisenberg picture where x, b and b^\\\\dagger are functions of time. Then, :[Q,x\\\\\\\\}=-ib :[Q,b\\\\\\\\}=0 :[Q,b^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{dx}{dt}-i\\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\} :[Q^\\\\dagger,x\\\\\\\\}=ib^\\\\dagger :[Q^\\\\dagger,b\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{dx}{dt}+i\\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\} :[Q^\\\\dagger,b^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=0 This is nonlinear in general: i.e., x(t), b(t) and b^\\\\dagger(t) do not form a linear SUSY representation because \\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\} isn't necessarily linear in x. To avoid this problem, define the self-adjoint operator F=\\\\Re\\\\\\\\{W\\\\\\\\}. Then, :[Q,x\\\\\\\\}=-ib :[Q,b\\\\\\\\}=0 :[Q,b^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{dx}{dt}-iF :[Q,F\\\\\\\\}=-\\\\frac{db}{dt} :[Q^\\\\dagger,x\\\\\\\\}=ib^\\\\dagger :[Q^\\\\dagger,b\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{dx}{dt}+iF :[Q^\\\\dagger,b^\\\\dagger\\\\\\\\}=0 :[Q^\\\\dagger,F\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{db^\\\\dagger}{dt} and we see that we have a linear SUSY representation. Now let's introduce two \\"formal\\" quantities, \\\\theta; and \\\\bar{\\\\theta} with the latter being the adjoint of the former such that :\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta,\\\\theta\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\bar{\\\\theta},\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\bar{\\\\theta},\\\\theta\\\\\\\\}=0 and both of them commute with bosonic operators but anticommute with fermionic ones. Next, we define a construct called a superfield: :f(t,\\\\bar{\\\\theta},\\\\theta)=x(t)-i\\\\theta b(t)-i\\\\bar{\\\\theta}b^\\\\dagger(t)+\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\\\theta F(t) f is self-adjoint, of course. Then, :[Q,f\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\theta}f-i\\\\bar{\\\\theta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}f, :[Q^\\\\dagger,f\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{\\\\theta}}f-i\\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}f. Incidentally, there's also a U(1)R symmetry, with p and x and W having zero R-charges and b^\\\\dagger having an R-charge of 1 and b having an R-charge of -1. Shape invariance Suppose W is real for all real x. Then we can simplify the expression for the Hamiltonian to :H = \\\\frac{(p)^2}{2}+\\\\frac{{W}^2}{2}+\\\\frac{W'}{2}(bb^\\\\dagger-b^\\\\dagger b) There are certain classes of superpotentials such that both the bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians have similar forms. Specifically : V_{+} (x, a_1 ) = V_{-} (x, a_2) + R(a_1) where the a's are parameters. For example, the hydrogen atom potential with angular momentum l can be written this way. : \\\\frac{-e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0} \\\\frac{1}{r} + \\\\frac{h^2 l (l+1)} {2m} \\\\frac{1}{r^2} - E_0 This corresponds to V_{-} for the superpotential :W = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2m}}{h} \\\\frac{e^2}{2 4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 (l+1)} - \\\\frac{h(l+1)}{r\\\\sqrt{2m}} :V_+ = \\\\frac{-e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0} \\\\frac{1}{r} + \\\\frac{h^2 (l+1) (l+2)} {2m} \\\\frac{1}{r^2} + \\\\frac{e^4 m}{32 \\\\pi^2 h^2 \\\\epsilon_0^2 (l+1)^2} This is the potential for l+1 angular momentum shifted by a constant. After solving the l=0 ground state, the supersymmetric operators can be used to construct the rest of the bound state spectrum. In general, since V_- and V_+ are partner potentials, they share the same energy spectrum except the one extra ground energy. We can continue this process of finding partner potentials with the shape invariance condition, giving the following formula for the energy levels in terms of the parameters of the potential : E_n=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^n R(a_i) where a_i are the parameters for the multiple partnered potentials.

He came to the throne on the death of his father, King Maelgwn Gwynedd. There are no historical records of his reign in this early age. A story preserved in both the Venedotian Code and an elegy by Taliesin says that he waged a war against Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut and the kings of Gododdin or Manaw Gododdin. The small scattered settlement of Caerhun in the Conwy valley is said to be named for him, though without strong authority. Rhun also appears in several medieval literary stories, as well as in the Welsh Triads. His wife was Perwyr ferch Rh√ªn \\"Ryfeddfawr\\" and their son was Beli ap Rhun \\"H√Ær\\". Rhun ap Maelgwn appears in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, -- the pedigree is given as: ... map Rotri map mermin map etthil merch cinnan map rotri map Intguaul map Catgualart map Catgollaun map Catman map Iacob map Beli map Run map Mailcun map Catgolaun Iauhir map Eniaun girt map Cuneda map AEtern ....

War with the North  The Venedotian Code of the Welsh laws compiled by Iorwerth ap Madog in the early 13th century, A History of Wales, Vol. I contains a list of the privileges of the men of Arfon. Among the privileges is the right to march in the van of Gwynedd's army, and this is stated to originate from their spirited actions in a war between Rhun of Gwynedd and the Cymric Men of the North () from the kingdoms of Alt Clut and Gododdin or Manaw Gododdin. Taliesin's Marwnad Rhun () also tells of the war and Rhun's death in it. In his comprehensive discussion of the works by and attributed to Taliesin, John Morris-Jones notes that the particulars of the marwnad are everywhere consistent with the historical record and nowhere inconsistent, and likely a product of the 6th century, a view shared by notable skeptics such as Thomas Stephens., Taliesin's Marwnad Rhun (Elegy of Rhun) The Venedotian Code says that the northern prince Elidyr Mwynfawr ap Gorwst Priodawr () had been slain at Aber Mewydus (now called 'Cadnant', or 'Battle Brook') in Arfon, not far from Rhun's llys () at Llanbeblig. Elidyr's powerful relatives in the North invaded Gwynedd in retaliation, burning Arfon in the process. The Northern host was led by Clydno Eiddin; Nudd the Generous, son of Senyllt; Mordaf the Generous, son of Serfan; and Rhydderch Hael, son of Tudwal Tudelyd. These are all notable men of the era who are listed in the royal genealogies of the Bonedd Gw≈∑r y Gogledd, as is Elidyr Mwynfawr. According to one of the Triads of the Horses, Elidyr was also the husband of Rhun's sister Eurgain.; Eurgain is said to be the daughter of Maelgwn Gwynedd and the wife of Elidyr Mwynfawr in one of the Trioedd y Meirch () of the Welsh Triads. Rhun then assembled an army and proceeded to the banks of the Gweryd (the banks of the River Forth or the Firth of Forth, which William Forbes Skene says was still called the 'Weryd' in 1165), The Four Ancient Books of Wales in the North. The final outcome is not given in the Venedotian Code, but Rhun and his army remained in the North for a considerable length of time., The Privileges of Arfon The outcome according to Taliesin's Marwnad Rhun is the death of Rhun ap Maelgwn in battle. He was succeeded by his son Beli ap Rhun as King of Gwynedd. The reason why Elidyr was in Gwynedd and the circumstance of his death are not known, though it is certain from their actions that his northern relatives blamed someone in Gwynedd. There are later stories that add speculations, for example by asserting that Elidyr was contesting Rhun's succession to Maelgwn Gwynedd's throne, -- for one example of many, where the authors skirt accountability by using terms such as \\"may have\\". Here, the authors claim that Elidyr may have been asserting a claim over Gwynedd because \\"... Rhun being, according to some genealogies, illegitimate.\\" but these are nothing more than speculation.  Caerhun  Caerhun () is the site of the 2nd century minor Roman fort of Canovium, situated along the Roman road between the larger Roman forts of Deva (at modern Chester) and Segontium (near modern Caernarfon). It is supposed to have been one of Rhun's strongholds, and while definitive evidence of this is lacking, it is circumstantially supported by archeological research and the antiquity of the name Caerhun. Furthermore, it guards an important crossing of the River Conwy at Tal-y-Cafn which leads to the pass at Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen,, A History of Wales, Vol. I an entrance to Eryri (), the defensive heartland of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Its military significance would certainly have been noticed by both defenders and potential aggressors.  Rhun in literature  The story of The Dream of Rhonabwy in the 12th century Red Book of Hergest is a prose literary tale where the main character travels to the time of King Arthur in a dream. There he sees the famous men from many historical eras. In a passage where 24 knights arrive to seek a truce with the famous Arthur, Arthur considers the request by assembling his counselors where \\"a tall, auburn, curly-headed man\\" was standing. Rhonabwy asks who he is, and is told that he is Rhun ap Maelgwn Gwynedd, a man who may join in counsel with anyone, because there was none in Britain better skilled in counsel than he., The Dream of Rhonabwy Marwnad Rhun (), once believed to be the work of Taliesin but no longer accepted as such, laments Rhun's death in battle during that War with the North. Rhun appears in two of the medieval Welsh Triads, as one of the 'Fair Princes of the Isle of Britain',, Letters on Welsh History and as one of the 'Golden-banded Ones of the Isle of Britain'., Letters on Welsh History Literary missteps The Tale of Taliesin is a legendary story about Taliesin printed in the Mabinogion, and based in part on the forgeries of the Iolo Manuscripts by Iolo Morganwg.; see especially the \\"Notices of Taliesin\\" on pp. 458 - 459 The story tells of events where Taliesin is placed in difficult or impossible situations but invariably overcomes all obstacles, usually through feats of magic. In one passage, Maelgwn Gwynedd sends his son Rhun on a mission to seduce the wife of Elffin ap Gwyddno. However, Elffin's court bard Taliesin knew of Maelgwn's plan because he was a seer, and arranged for a servant to replace his patron's wife, to the ultimate embarrassment of his patron's opponent Maelgwn., Taliesin One of the Triads mentions a certain Rhun ap Beli, Letters on Welsh History, The Ecclesiastical Antiquities of the Kymry () who was famed for his military exploits. The name is repeated elsewhere in medieval poetry, such as in Hywel Foel's (fl. c. 1240 - 1300) awdl lamenting the capture and imprisonment of Owain ap Gruffudd, where he likens Owain to Rhun: \\"Who if free, like Rhun the son of Beli, Would not let Lloegria burn his borders\\"., Welsh Poetry from AD 1240 - 1284 There is no confirming evidence that such a person existed, and it is contradicted by records such as the royal genealogies, which have Rhun as the father (not the son) of Beli. Scholars such as Thomas Stephens have concluded that this is a mistake, and that the intended person was someone else.

Canada  In Canada, means tests are used for student finance (for post-secondary education), legal aid, and \\"welfare\\" (direct transfer payments to individuals to combat poverty). They are not generally used for primary and secondary education which are tax-funded. Means tests for public health insurance were once common but are now illegal, as the Canada Health Act of 1984 requires that all the provinces provide universal healthcare coverage to be eligible for subsidies from the federal government. Means tests are also not used for pensions and seniors' benefits, but there is a clawback of Old Age Security payments for people making over $69,562 (in 2012). The Last Post Fund uses a means test on a deceased veteran's estate and surviving widow to determine whether him or her are eligible for federal funding to subsidize their funeral. United Kingdom Resentment over a means test was among the factors giving rise to the National Unemployed Workers' Movement in the United Kingdom.http://www.wcml.org.uk/contents/protests-politics-and-campaigning-for- change/unemployment/national-unemployed-workers-movement/ Today, means-tested benefits‚Äîmeaning that entitlement is affected by the amount of income and savings‚Äîis a central feature of the benefit system. Means testing is also part of the determination of legal aid in a magistrates court and for the higher Crown Court. The means test is based on income, family circumstances and essential living costs. United States Means testing is used to test for eligibility to Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Section 8 housing, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work-Study Program, direct subsidized student loans, as well as the eligibility for relief for debtors who have sufficient financial means to pay a portion of their debts.\\"Understanding Bankruptcy. Second Edition. Jeff Ferriell and Edward J. Janger. LexisNexis. 2007. p. 28. The means test is perhaps best recognized in the United States as the test used by courts to determine eligibility for Title 11 of the United States Code Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the test was used to screen applicants for such programs as Home Relief, and starting in the 1960s, for benefits such as those provided by Medicaid and the Food Stamp Program. In 1992, third-party Presidential candidate Ross Perot proposed that future Social Security benefits be subjected to a means test; though this was hailed by some as a potential solution to a purported impending crisis in funding the program, few other political candidates since Perot have publicly made the same suggestion, which would require costly investigations and might associate accepting those benefits with social stigma. In 2005, the US substantially changed its bankruptcy laws, adding a means test to prevent wealthy debtors from filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. The most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within . The amendments effectively subject most debtors who make an income, as calculated by the Code, above the median income of the debtor's state to an income-based test. This is referred to as the \\"means test.\\" The means test provides for a finding of abuse if the debtor's income is higher than a specified portion of their debts. If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may be rebutted only in the case of \\"special circumstances.\\"11 U.S.C. ¬ß 707(b)(2)(B) Debtors whose income is below the state's median income are not subject to the means test. Notably, the Code-calculated income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \\"current monthly income\\" as \\"presumed income.\\" If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. Thus, the means test is a formula designed to keep filers with higher incomes from filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These filers may use Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay a portion of their debts, but may not use Chapter 7 to wipe out their debts altogether. Many think the bankruptcy means test is complex but generous and most debtors seem to have no trouble meeting its requirements, while others have suggested that the means test is not all that fair or equitable, and have somewhat cynically pointed out that the reference to consumer protection in the bankruptcy act is ironic at best, since those with primarily consumer debt are required to pass a means test while businesses are not. What is undeniable is that it is complex, and the terms that govern many parts of it ‚Äì including those terms that control whether it applies at all ‚Äì are of unsettled definition.Abanet.org Other examples Other examples of means testing include Medifund in SingaporeMeans Testing for Medical Subsidies and Medical Cards in Ireland. Both are used in the healthcare sector. Australia uses a means test for its Age Pension.  Criticism  Means-testing has been criticized on a number of grounds, the most fundamental of which is the distinction between a social program, which helps all equally or in proportion to their taxation, and a poverty program, which disproportionately helps the poor. For example, William Beveridge, in the Beveridge Report (blueprint for the UK's post-war social system) was opposed to means-testing, due to the poverty trap. Issues of a poverty program versus a social program include the following: ;Stigma: A program benefiting only the poor may carry a stigma on its use and be demeaning; compare poverty food. ;Political support: A program benefiting only the poor may lack broad- based political support, in contrast to programs that all share in. This can make it easier to reduce the benefits later.New Fear For State Pensions, October 30,2010, Alison Little ;Redistribution:Poverty programs transfer money from the rich to the poor, as they benefit the poor only but are paid for by both rich and poor taxpayers. Further objections to means-testing include the following: ;Poverty trap: Means tests, particularly sharp cut-offs, create high effective marginal tax rates and can serve to keep people in poverty, both by removing social support as the person tries to escape poverty, and by discouraging such attempts by high costs. For example, asset-based limits, such as requiring an individual to have little or no savings to qualify, not only discourage saving (because of the cost of being disqualified from such savings) but also require people to become completely destitute to qualify and prevent them from having any much-needed savings when attempting to escape poverty. ;Access:Means tests, particularly complicated ones and ones that differ between programs and between different levels of government, complicate access to programs: individuals cannot easily know whether they qualify and may qualify for some programs but not others. In the absence of centralized outreach, the added complication of means tests means that some, perhaps many people who qualify for programs, do not benefit from them. ;Administrative costs: Means tests increase administrative costs (overhead), due to the work of verifying that the tests are satisfied. Some argue that these costs can offset or more than offset the savings by reduced payouts under means-testing. ;Entitlement/promises: If means-testing is implemented in an existing program, particularly for which people have paid taxes but not benefited, as in pensions or medical insurance, the reduction in benefits can be seen as a breach of promise and entitlement of the program.

Hakomi is grounded in five principles: *mindfulness *nonviolence *organicity *unity *body-mind holism These five principles are set forth in Kurtz's book, Body Centered Psychotherapy. Some Hakomi leaders add two more principles, truth and mutability. The Hakomi Method regards people as self-organizing systems, organized psychologically around core memories, beliefs and images; this core material expresses itself through habits and attitudes that tend to guide people unconsciously. Hakomi is a method for helping people discover and recognize these patterns. The goal is to transform their way of being in the world through working with core material and changing core beliefs.Kurtz 1990: 2-4 Hakomi relies on mindfulness of body sensations, emotions and memories. Although many therapists now recommend mindfulness meditation to support psychotherapy, Hakomi is unique in that it conducts the majority of the therapy session in mindfulness. The Hakomi Method follows this general outline: Kurtz 1990: 72-74 #Create healing relationship: Client and therapist work to build a relationship that maximizes safety and the cooperation of the unconscious. This includes practicing ‚Äúloving presence‚Äù, a state of acceptance and empathic resonance. #Establish mindfulness: Therapist helps clients study and focus on the ways they organize experience. Hakomi's viewpoint is that most behaviors are habits automatically organized by core material; therefore studying the organization of experience is studying the influence of this core material. #Evoke experience: Client and therapist make direct contact with core feelings, beliefs and memories using \\"experiments in mindfulness\\"‚Äîgentle somatic and verbal techniques to safely \\"access\\" the present experience behind the client's verbal presentation, or to explore \\"indicators\\": chronic physical patterns, habitual gestures, bodily tension, etc. #Processing: This process usually evokes deeper emotions and/or memories, and if the client feels ready, the therapist helps them deepen into these, often using state-specific processing such as \\"working with the child\\" and/or strong emotions. The client is helped to recognize the core beliefs as they emerge, and the therapist often provides what Kurtz called ‚Äúthe missing experience‚Äù, a form of \\"memory re-consolidation\\" where the child, as they revisit the negative experience(s) that generated their core beliefs, now receives the nourishment and support that was needed at the time. This supports the process of transformation of core beliefs. The same process may be used working with the adult rather than the \\"child state.\\" # Transformation: The client has an experience in therapy different from the one they had as a child (or are having as an adult) and experientially realizes that new healing experiences are possible and begins to be open to these experiences. # Integration: Client and therapist work to make connections between the new healing experiences and the rest of the client's life and relationships. Other components of the Hakomi Method include the sensitivity cycle, techniques such as \\"contact and tracking\\", \\"probes\\" and \\"taking over\\", \\"embracing resistance\\" and developing a greater sensitivity to clients and how to work with their individual issues based on character typology originated by Alexander Lowen. Related therapies The Hakomi Institute, an international nonprofit organization founded in 1981, teaches Hakomi Therapy worldwide. Its website includes an international directory of Hakomi practitioners. The Institute's programs focus on training psychotherapists and professionals in related fields. Its faculty are mainly professional psychotherapists who base their teaching of the Hakomi Method on current discoveries in neuroscience, and on their own clinical insights. The Hakomi Institute is a professional member of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, the U.S. Association for Body Psychotherapists, and an accredited Continuing Education provider for the National Board for Certified Counselors and the National Association of Social Workers. Ron Kurtz left the Hakomi Institute in the 1990s to create a new organization, Ron Kurtz Trainings. With a new group, he developed the Hakomi Method in new directions, offering training for both professionals and laypeople. He called the refined version of his work Hakomi Assisted Self-Discovery. Both versions of the Hakomi Method are based in loving presence, mindfulness, somatics and the other principles described above, and fall within the definition of body psychotherapy. Another technique based on the Hakomi Method is Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, developed by Pat Ogden. Validation Body psychotherapy has been scientifically validated by the European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP) as having a number of modalities within this branch of psychotherapy. Hakomi Therapy is one of the approaches or modalities within Body Psychotherapy recognized by the EAP.EABP & EAP article, p3 Notes Sources * * Further reading * The Herald (September 22, 2004) Hakomi is the topic.

During his 13-year MLS career, he was four- time MLS Best XI and the 2005 MLS Defender of the Year. He also earned 27 caps with the United States men's national soccer team and went to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry and currently stars on his YouTube channel Jimmy Conrad. He currently serves as the head coach of USL League Two side San Francisco Glens.  Early life  On February 12, 1977, Conrad was born in Arcadia, California. Conrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California. Career =High school and college= Conrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at San Diego State University in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 NCAA Championship team. =Professional= Undrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the Los Angeles Galaxy. However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams. Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct San Diego Flash of the A-League which gave him a contract. In 1999, Brian Quinn became the head coach of the San Jose Clash. When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, Ralf Wilhelms, head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the San Diego Sockers, recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper Joe Cannon.Often-overlooked Jimmy Conrad, now with national team, has proved doubters wrong The Clash signed Conrad that year. He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the MLS Cup in 2001. In 2000, he also played for Lech Pozna≈Ñ in Poland. In 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select Arturo Alvarez. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the US Open Cup and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's Best XI and was a finalist for MLS Defender of the Year Award. He won the award a year later. Despite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach Curt Onalfo rewarded him the club captaincy. Conrad was out of contract after the 2010 MLS season and elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010 Conrad was selected by Chivas USA in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft. He made his debut, and scored his first goal for his new team on March 19, 2011 in their first game of the 2011 MLS season ‚Äì ironically against his old club, Sporting Kansas City.Bravo's debut double for Sporting sinks Chivas USA After struggling with injury during the 2011 season, and suffering from side effects of six concussions, Jimmy Conrad announced his retirement from professional soccer on August 18, 2011.

Less than one year later, Conrad made the U.S. roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against Italy in the team's 1‚Äì1 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against Ghana. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international friendly with Denmark. The U.S. won that match 3‚Äì1. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with Mexico, Conrad was named the Man of the Match. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. A great header from him, assist from Landon Donavan from a corner kick. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the upcoming CONCACAF Gold Cup. =Coaching= In September 2018, Conrad became technical director and head associate coach of the San Francisco Glens.

Sources from the 11th and 12th centuries (such as the 12th-century Russkaya Pravda) mention their presence in Kievan Rus' and Poland as the smardones. Etymologically, the word smerd comes from a common Indo-European root meaning \\"ordinary man\\" or \\"dependent man\\". In Kievan Rus', smerdy were peasants who gradually lost their freedom (partially or completely) and whose legal status differed from group to group. Unlike slaves, they had their own property and had to pay fines for their delinquencies, legally the smerds never possessed full rights; the killing of a smerd was punished by the same fine as the killing of a kholop (similarly to a slave). The property of the deceased was inherited by the knyaz (prince). The Russkaya Pravda forbade torturing the smerds during court examination without the consent of the knyaz. During the 12th and the 13th centuries a number of sources mention the smerdy while narrating events in Halych-Volynia and in Novgorod. It appears that during this period the term smerd encompassed the whole rural population of a given region. Sources of the 14th and 15th centuries refer to the smerds of Novgorod and Pskov as peasant-proprietors, who possessed lands collectively (communes) or individually and had the right to freely alienate their own allotments. However, their personal freedom was limited: they were forbidden to seek a new master or princely patronage. The knyaz could not accept complaints from the smerds against their master. Also, the smerds had to provide labor services and to pay tribute (dan') to the benefit of the city as a collective feudal master. In Russia from the 14th century the word smerd as a denotation for peasants and other commonfolk was replaced with the word krestyanin (–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω–∏–Ω), meaning Christian. The change was connected to the dieout of Slavic paganism by that time, as well as to the Islamization of the Golden Horde under √ñz Beg Khan (ruled 1313‚Äì1341), which fostered the rise of Christian self-identification in the vassal Russian lands, that were under Mongol yoke. The old word smerd continued to be used in the pejorative meaning, often in a situation when a lord spoke to dependent people or even lesser nobles. Also the word acquired a meaning of \\"one who stinks\\", with the related verb 'smerdet' (—Å–º–µ—Ä–¥–µ—Ç—å, to stink). https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4#Russian  Notes  External links * The Smerd in Kievan Russia * \\"Smerdy\\" in The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition Category:Kievan Rus society Category:Peasants ","title":"Smerd"},{"id":"1157915","text":"Savanne () or Savannah is a district of Mauritius, situated in the south of the island.

When they arrive, Alex gives Marie a tour of her house before they settle down for dinner. After dinner, Marie and Alex get ready to go to bed. As Alex sleeps, Marie lies on her bed listening to music and masturbating. Marie hears a doorbell ring and Alex's father Daniel wakes to answer it. The man at the door is a serial killer, who slashes Daniel's face with a straight razor. His head is pressed between two spindles of the staircase, and the killer shoves a bookcase towards his head, decapitating him. The noise awakens Alex's mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer. Marie, hearing the mother's screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed. The killer inspects Marie's room but does not find her. Marie creeps downstairs and finds Alex chained in her bedroom. Promising to find help, she sneaks into the parents' room to find a phone. After hearing loud thuds, she hides in the closet and through the slats of the door witnesses the killing of Alex's mother as her throat is brutally slashed with a razor. Alex's younger brother Tom runs from the house to the cornfield, pursued by the killer. Marie returns to Alex, where she witnesses Tom's murder from a window. Marie promises to free Alex, but the killer is heard returning. Marie sneaks into the kitchen and takes a butcher knife. Alex is dragged into the killer's truck. Marie sneaks into the truck with the butcher knife and hides there with Alex. He locks them in and drives off. When the killer stops at a gas station, Marie gives Alex the knife and sneaks into the gas station shop for help. When the killer comes into the shop, Marie hides and she witnesses the store clerk Jimmy being murdered with an axe. The killer returns to the truck and Marie calls the police, but hangs up in frustration when she's unable to tell them where she is. She takes the clerk's keys and uses his car to follow the killer down a deserted road. The killer notices Marie following him, and rams Marie's vehicle, pushing the car off the road where it wrecks. Exiting on foot, badly injured, Marie runs into the forest as the killer seeks her. Eventually, Marie bludgeons the killer with a fence post covered in barbed wire. As Marie inspects the body, he grabs at her throat, so Marie suffocates him with a plastic sheet and makes her way back to the truck. Alex seems terrified of Marie as she returns to the vehicle. As police investigate the gas station murders via the in-store videotape, the tape shows Marie murdering the store clerk. In retrospect, it is revealed that Marie is murderous, delusional, and in love with Alex and the real killer of Alex's family. At the truck, Marie unties Alex. As soon as Alex is free, she threatens Marie with the knife and accuses her of butchering her family. Alex slashes Marie's face and stabs her in the stomach before running into the forest. Marie chases Alex with a concrete saw. Alex finds a road and flags down a car. As Alex is climbing into the car, Marie appears brandishing the concrete saw and disembowels the driver. A stray piece of glass slices Alex's Achilles tendon. Alex takes a crowbar from the car's toolbox and crawls along the road. Marie forces Alex to tell her that she loves her, and she kisses her. While engaged in the kiss, Alex plunges the crowbar into Marie's upper-chest as Marie proclaims she'll never let anyone come between them. Some time later, Marie is in a psychiatric hospital room, with Alex watching her through a one-way mirror. Marie grins and reaches for Alex, evidently aware that she is behind it.

The film was shown at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival during the Midnight Madness section. After screening at the festival, the film was purchased by Lionsgate Films for North American distribution. In her book Films of the New French Extremity, Alexandra West described The screening of High Tension at Midnight Madness made that section of the film festival an \\"unintentional bastion for New French Extremity\\", which still did not have a popular following. Following High Tensions's release there, other films followed at the festival such as Calvaire (2004), Sheitan (2006) and Frontier(s) and Inside (2007) and Martyrs (2008). In the United States, Lionsgate released an English-dubbed version of the film in 1323 theaters on 10 June 2005 (with $14 million marketing cost). Several murders scenes were truncated in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. A re-cut theatrical trailer was released by Lionsgate to promote the film, featuring \\"Superstar\\" by Sonic Youth. =Censorship= Some scenes were edited for the American version to achieve an R rating by the MPAA. About one minute of the film was cut in order to avoid the NC-17 rating. The R-rated edition was released in American cinemas, and in a less widely circulated fullscreen DVD. This section notes what was deleted from the unrated, original French film to produce the American version. * Alex's father is graphically decapitated with a bookcase, his headless neck spraying blood. In the R-rated version, the murder is edited to quickly cut away as the bookcase crushes and severs his head. Later the body is seen on the staircase without the head. * When Alex's mother has her throat slashed, the scene is shortened; most of the arterial spurting, as the killer pulls back her head, is gone. Subsequent shots of Marie inspecting the body have also been edited. * The death of Jimmy the gas station clerk has been shortened. Close-up shots of the axe sticking in his chest have been removed. * The scene where Marie strikes the killer's face with the barbed wire pole is shortened and less explicit; Marie hits the killer fewer times, and fewer details of the killer's wounds are shown. * The driver's disembowelment with the concrete saw was shortened. * A close-up of the crowbar in Marie's shoulder is missing. Reception According to the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 40% approval rating based on 132 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.12/10. The consensus states: \\"There is indeed a good amount of tension in this French slasher, but the dubbing is bad and the end twist unbelievable.\\" It also received a score of 42 on Metacritic based on 30 critics, classifying it as having received \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C-\\" on an A+ to F scale. American film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film only one star, opening his review, \\"The philosopher Thomas Hobbes tells us life can be 'poor, nasty, brutish and short.' So is this movie.\\" He added that the film had a plot hole \\"that is not only large enough to drive a truck through, but in fact does have a truck driven right through it.\\" Lisa Nesselson of Variety was more forgiving, saying that the film \\"deftly juggles gore and suspense,\\" has \\"unnerving sound design,\\" and \\"has a sinister, haemoglobin look that fits the story like a glove.\\" James Berardinelli praised the film, writing: \\"The film revels in blood and gore, but this is not just a run-of-the-mill splatter film. There's a lot of intelligence in both the script and in Alexandre Aja's direction..For those who enjoy horror films and don't mind copious quantities of red-dyed fluids, this one is not to be missed. It's a triumph of the Grand Guignol.\\" The Village Voices Mark Holcomb wrote that the film resembles \\"a pastiche of '70s American slasher flicks that seemingly stands to add to the worldwide glut of irono-nostalgic sequels, remakes, and retreads,\\" ultimately seeing it a \\"gratifyingly gory, doggedly intellectual decon of the likes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and (surprisingly but aptly) Duel.\\" Controversy The film was included in TIME Magazine's 10 most ridiculously violent films. Several viewers of the film noticed striking similarities between the plot of the film and the plot of Dean Koontz's novel Intensity. When questioned at the Sundance Festival in 2004, the director acknowledged that he had read the novel and was aware of the similarities. On his website, Koontz stated that he was aware of the comparison but would not sue \\"because he found the film so puerile, so disgusting, and so intellectually bankrupt that he didn‚Äôt want the association with it that would inevitably come if he pursued an action against the filmmaker.\\" Soundtrack * Muse ‚Äî \\"New Born\\" * Ricchi e Poveri ‚Äî \\"Sar√† perch√© ti amo\\" * U-Roy ‚Äî \\"Runaway Girl\\" * F√©lix Gray and Didier Barbelivien ‚Äî \\"A toutes les filles\\" * Fran√ßois Eudes-Chanfrault ‚Äî \\"Faustina Mauricio Mercedes\\" * Scott Nickoley, Jamie Dunlap, Molly Pasutti, and Marc Ferrari ‚Äî \\"I Believe\\" * Fran√ßois Eudes-Chanfrault ‚Äî \\"Celebration A2\\" * Arch Bacon ‚Äî \\"Pillow Talk\\" * Fran√ßois Eudes-Chanfrault ‚Äî \\"Paris‚ÄîNice\\" * Fran√ßois Eudes-Chanfrault ‚Äî \\"Out of the Mundial\\" Reference in other media * In the 2008 video game Silent Hill Homecoming, one of the unlockable weapons is a circular saw.

In the speech, which was delivered on April 3, 1964, at Cory Methodist Church in Cleveland, Ohio,Malcolm X Speaks, p. 23. Malcolm X advised African Americans to judiciously exercise their right to vote, but he cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms. It was ranked 7th in the top 100 American speeches of the 20th century by 137 leading scholars of American public address. Background =Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam= On March 8, 1964, Malcolm X announced his separation from the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist religious organization for which he had been the spokesman for nearly a decade.Perry, p. 249. The Nation of Islam, which advocated on behalf of African Americans, had significant disagreements with the Civil Rights Movement. Whereas the Civil Rights Movement advocated on behalf of integration and against segregation, the Nation of Islam favored separatism. One of the goals of the Civil Rights Movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in the political process.Natambu, p. 260. When he left the Nation of Islam, Malcolm declared his willingness to cooperate with the Civil Rights Movement. He reassured leaders of the Civil Rights Movement that \\"I've forgotten everything bad that [they] have said about me, and I pray they can also forget the many bad things I've said about them.\\"Malcolm X Speaks, p. 20. =The Civil Rights Act of 1964= In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent Congress a civil rights bill. The bill proposed a ban on discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or national origin in jobs and public accommodations. Southern Democrats, sometimes called Dixiecrats, blocked the bill from consideration by the House of Representatives. After Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson threw his support behind the civil rights bill. The bill was passed by the House on February 10, 1964, and sent to the Senate for consideration. Southern Democrats had promised to oppose the bill. The speech Malcolm X began his speech by acknowledging that he was still a Muslim, but he quickly added that he didn't intend to discuss religion or any other issues that divide African Americans. Instead, he was going to emphasize the common experience of African Americans of all faiths: > It's time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for > us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem ‚Äî a problem > that will make you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a > Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you > live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like > I am.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 24. =The ballot= Malcolm X noted that 1964 was an election year, a year \\"when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community ... with their false promises which they don't intend to keep\\".Malcolm X Speaks, p. 25. He said that President Johnson and the Democratic Party claimed to support the civil rights bill, and the Democrats controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but they had not taken genuine action to pass the bill. Instead, he said, the Democrats blamed the Dixiecrats, who were \\"nothing but Democrat[s] in disguise\\". He accused the Democrats of playing a \\"political con game\\", with African Americans as its victims.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 28. Malcolm said that African Americans were becoming \\"politically mature\\" and recognizing that, through unity and nonalignment, they could be the swing vote in the coming elections and elect candidates who would be attentive to their concerns: > What does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and > Black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to > determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the > dog house.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 26. Malcolm described how potent a weapon the ballot could be, if it was exercised with care: > A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a > target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in > your pocket.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 38. =The government= Although he advocated exercising the ballot, Malcolm X expressed skepticism that voting would bring about full equality for African Americans. The government, he said, \\"is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of Black people in this country.... This government has failed the Negro\\".Malcolm X Speaks, p. 31. According to Malcolm, one of the ways in which the government had \\"failed the Negro\\" was its unwillingness to enforce the law. He pointed out that the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation, > Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your > legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to > deprive you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And > this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation. > Which means a segregationist is breaking the law.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 33. But, he said, the police department and local government often sided with segregationists against the Civil Rights Movement. Malcolm said that relying on the federal government to force local governments to obey civil rights laws was futile. \\"When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible; it's like running from the wolf to the fox. They're all in cahoots together\\".Malcolm X Speaks, p. 35. =Human rights= The proper solution, Malcolm X said, was to elevate the struggle of African Americans from one of civil rights to one of human rights. A fight for civil rights was a domestic matter, and \\"no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle\\".Malcolm X Speaks, p. 34. Malcolm said that changing the fight for African-American equality to a human rights issue changed it from a domestic problem to an international matter that could be heard by the United Nations. He contrasted civil rights, which he described as \\"asking Uncle Sam to treat you right\\", to human rights, which he called \\"your God-given rights\\" and \\"the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth\\". He said that the people of the developing world were \\"sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side\\" if the fight for civil rights were expanded into a human rights struggle. =Black nationalism= Malcolm X described his continued commitment to black nationalism, which he defined as the philosophy that African Americans should govern their own communities. He said that Black nationalists believe that African Americans should control the politics and the economy in their communities and that they need to remove the vices, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, that afflict their communities.Malcolm X Speaks, pp. 38‚Äì39. Malcolm said that the philosophy of Black nationalism was being taught in the major civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, CORE, and SNCC. Black nationalism was characterized by its political, social, and economic philosophies. The political philosophy is self-government. The local governments of the African-American communities should be managed by African Americans. African Americans should be \\"re-educated into the science of politics\\" in order to understand the importance and effect of the vote they cast. > Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet. You don't > throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within > your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket. The economic philosophy of black nationalism promotes African-American control of the economy of the African-American community. In frequenting stores not owned by an African American, the money is given to another community. The dollar is taken from the African-American community and given to outsiders. In doing so, the African-American community loses money and becomes poorer while the community the dollar was given to gains money and becomes richer. Therefore, stores in the African-American community should be run by African Americans. > Then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area. And > where you and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out > of the community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community > tied up; so that though we spend it in the community, at sundown the man who > runs the store takes it over across town somewhere.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 39. The social philosophy of black nationalism advocates for reform of the community and reconstruction of it so it is more welcoming. > We ourselves have to lift the level of our community to a higher level, make > our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own circles > and won't be running around here try to knock our way into a social circle > where we're not wanted. Most of all, Malcolm promoted unity. > We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each > other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We > have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony that's > necessary to get this problem solved ourselves.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 40. =Self-defense= Malcolm X addressed the issue of \\"rifles and shotguns\\", a controversy that had dogged him since his March 8 announcement that he had left the Nation of Islam.Cone, pp. 195‚Äì196. At his press conference, Malcolm X said that \\"in areas where our people are the constant victims of brutality, and the government seems unable or unwilling to protect them, we should form rifle clubs that can be used to defend our lives and our property in times of emergency\\". Malcolm X Speaks, p. 22. He reiterated his position that if the government is \\"unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes\\", African Americans should defend themselves.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 43. He advised his listeners to be mindful of the law ‚Äî \\"This doesn't mean you're going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks ... that would be illegal and we don't do anything illegal\\" ‚Äî but he said that if white people didn't want African Americans to arm themselves, the government should do its job. =The bullet= Malcolm X referred to \\"the type of Black man on the scene in America today [who] doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer\\", and warned that if politicians failed to keep their promises to African Americans, they made violence inevitable: > It's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize > what the ballot is for; what we're supposed to get when we cast a ballot; > and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation > where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a ballot or a > bullet.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 30. Malcolm predicted that if the civil rights bill wasn't passed, there would be a march on Washington in 1964. Unlike the 1963 March on Washington, which was peaceful and integrated, the 1964 march Malcolm described would be an all- Black \\"non-nonviolent army\\" with one-way tickets.Malcolm X Speaks, p. 44. But, Malcolm said, there was still time to prevent this situation from developing: > Lyndon B. Johnson is the head of the Democratic Party. If he's for civil > rights, let him go into the Senate next week and ... denounce the Southern > branch of his party. Let him go in there right now and take a moral stand ‚Äî > right now, not later. Tell him, don't wait until election time. If he waits > too long ... he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this > country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the > ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these > people never dreamed of. In 1964, it's the ballot or the bullet. Analysis \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" served several purposes at a critical point in Malcolm X's life: it was part of his effort to distance himself from the Nation of Islam, and it was intended to reach out to moderate civil rights leaders. At the same time, the speech indicated that Malcolm still supported Black nationalism and self-defense and thus had not made a complete break with his past. \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" also marked a notable shift in Malcolm X's rhetoric, as he presented previously undiscussed ways of looking at the relationship between blacks and whites. =Separation from the Nation of Islam= In its advocacy of voting, \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" presented ideas opposite to those of the Nation of Islam, which forbade its members from participating in the political process. Malcolm also chose not to discuss the religious differences that divide Muslims and Christians, a common theme of his speeches when he was the spokesman for the Nation of Islam. In \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\", Malcolm chose not to discuss religion but rather to stress the experiences common to African Americans of all backgrounds.Cone, p. 194. =Black nationalism= When Malcolm X spoke of \\"the type of Black man on the scene in America today [who] doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer\\", he was addressing his followers, people who were not advocates of the non-violent approach generally favored by the Civil Rights Movement. Likewise, by stating his continued commitment to Black nationalism, Malcolm reassured his followers that he had not made a complete break with his past.Cone, pp. 194‚Äì195. One biographer notes that Malcolm was one of the first African- American leaders to note the existence and growing influence of Black nationalism among young civil rights activists.Natambu, pp. 302‚Äì303. =Rhetoric= \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" indicates a shift in Malcolm X's rhetoric, as his separation from the Nation of Islam and new, unfettered public activism prompted a change in the ways he addressed his audience. Malcolm X maintained his use of repetition as \\"communications of the passion that is satisfied by a single statement, but that beats through the pulses\\", and this can be exemplified by his consistent use of the phrase \\"the ballot or the bullet\\". In addition, Malcolm X used his characteristic use of language and imagery to disguise his conceptions of society and history in new ways to put issues into his perspective for his audience and inspire activism. The most significant modification of Malcolm X's rhetoric that can be observed in \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" is the broadening of his audience, as he \\"emphasizes individualized judgement rather than group cohesion\\" and allows for more analytical \\"flexibility restrained by a purposive focus on particular goals.\\" These changes expanded his appeal, therefore expanding his audience, illustrating his ability to use the freedom he found after separating from the Nation of Islam to his advantage in advancing himself as a member of the Civil Rights Movement.

It became a popular side dish throughout Yugoslavia after World War II and is nowadays popular in Southeastern Europe. Homemade ajvar is made of roasted or cooked peppers. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of added chili peppers, it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or very hot. Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread or as a side dish. Ajvar has a few variations. One variation containing tomato and eggplant and one made with green bell peppers and oregano. ‚ÄúHomemade Leskovac Ajvar‚Äù and ‚ÄúMacedonian Ajvar‚Äù are registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization in order to protect their brand names. Etymology and origin The name ajvar comes from the Turkish word havyar, which means \\"salted roe, caviar\\" shares an etymology with \\"caviar\\", coming from the Persian word \\"xaviyar\\".https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=havyar&x;=0&y;=0Etimolo≈°ki reƒçnik srpskog jezika I, 2003, s.v. ajvar Prior to the 20th century, significant local production of caviar occurred on the Danube, with sturgeon swimming from the Black Sea up to Belgrade.; Domestic ajvar, meaning \\"caviar\\", used to be a very popular dish in Belgrade homes and restaurants, ; but the domestic production of caviar was not steady starting in the 1890s because of labor disputes. Eventually a special pepper salad was offered as a substitute in Belgrade restaurants under the name \\"red ajvar\\" (crveni ajvar) or \\"Serbian ajvar\\" (srpski ajvar).; Preparation Ajvar and other pickles in a home larder Homemade ajvar is made of roasted, minced and then cooked peppers, while some industrial producers use fresh minced peppers, cooked with sunflower oil afterwards, which leads to a lower quality. Ajvar preparation is somewhat difficult, because it requires considerable manual labour, particularly for peeling the roasted peppers. Traditionally, people prepare it in mid-autumn, when bell peppers are most abundant, and preserve it in glass jars for consumption throughout the year. Anecdotally, most households' stocks do not last until the spring, when fresh vegetables become available, so it is usually enjoyed as a winter food. Often, the whole family or neighbours gather to prepare the bell peppers. The principal cultivar of pepper used is called roga (i.e. \\"horned\\"). Roga is large, red, horn-shaped, with thick flesh and relatively easy to peel. It typically ripens in late September. To produce ajvar, bell peppers are roasted whole on a plate on an open fire, a plate of wood in a stove, or in an oven. The baked peppers must briefly cool to allow the flesh to separate from the skin. Next, the skin is carefully peeled off and the seeds are removed. The peppers are then ground in a mill or chopped into tiny pieces (this variant is often referred to as pindjur). Finally, the resulting mush is stewed for several hours in large pots. Sunflower oil is added at this stage to condense and reduce the water, and to enhance later preservation. Salt (and sometimes vinegar) is added at the end and the hot mush is poured directly into sterilized glass jars, which are sealed immediately. Production Commercially made ajvar Ajvar is produced in most Balkan countries, including Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Slovenia and Serbia.

The son of missionaries in Hawaii, he rose through the Union Army during the American Civil War to become a general, leading units of African American soldiers.Robert Francis Engs, Samuel C. Armstrong (1839-1893) available at https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Armstrong_Samuel_Chapman_1839-1893 He became best known as an educator, founding and becoming the first principal of the normal school for African-American and later Native American pupils in Virginia which later became Hampton University. He also founded the university's museum, the Hampton University Museum, which is the oldest African-American museum in the country, and the oldest museum in Virginia. Early and family life The third son of Christian missionary Richard Armstrong (1805‚Äì1860), Armstrong was born in Wailuku, Maui, Kingdom of Hawai ªi, the sixth of ten children (eight of which survived to adulthood). His mother, Clarissa Chapman Armstrong, grew up in a Congregational family in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His father was a Presbyterian minister sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, founded by several Williams College graduates associated with various Protestant denominations. His parents were among the first missionaries to what was then known as the Sandwich Islands. Arriving in 1832, they established several Christian congregations on various Hawai'ian islands. In 1840, following the death of experienced missionary Rev. Armstrong, he became the second shepherd of Kawaiaha ªo Church in Honolulu on the main island of O ªahu when Samuel was an infant. Many chiefs and their families attended the historic church (which received its current name in 1853 under Rev. Armstrong). Rev. Armstrong also served on the kingdom's privy council and became the Minister of Education and later Superintendent of Public Instruction. He established schools throughout the kingdom, and emphasized learning a manual trade in addition to farming. He graduated students proficient in blacksmithing, carpentry or barrel-making in addition to reading, writing and arithmetic.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Armstrong_Samuel_Chapman_1839-1893 Like many children of missionaries and tribal leaders, Samuel attended Punahou School and associated Oahu College in Honolulu for his elementary education. There is a bronze plaque at Punahou commemorating him as a \\"Son of Punahou\\". After finishing Punahou he became his father's secretary. After his father suffered a horseback accident and died in 1860, Samuel Armstrong, aged 21, followed his father's wishes and sailed from Hawai ªi for the mainland United States to begin his own studies at Williams College in Massachusetts. He graduated in 1862.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 15 Armstrong married Emma Dean Walker of Stockbridge, Massachusetts on October 13, 1869, but she died on November 10, 1878 after giving birth to daughters Louise H. Armstrong Scoville and Edith E. Armstrong, both of whom would later teach briefly at the Hampton Institute (and Louise's husband William Scoville would serve for decades as a trustee). He remained a widower for more than a decade.See also 1870 U.S. Federal Census for Hampton Virginia and 1880 U.S. Federal Census for San Francisco, California, both of which reference a Hawaiian-born Samuel C. Chapman of appropriate age Armstrong remarried in Montpelier, Vermont on September 10, 1890, to Mary Alice Ford, a teacher at the Hampton Institute. Their son, Daniel Armstrong, would become a career U.S. Naval officer and commanded the Negro Recruit Training Program at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center near Waukegan, Illinois during World War II (1939‚Äì1945). Their daughter, Margaret Armstrong, would marry Hampton's Institute's president during the Great Depression (1931-1940), Arthur Howe, and their sons would, in turn, serve as trustees from the 1950s into the 1970s. Civil War During Samuel Armstrong's studies at Williams College, the American Civil War divided the United States. Like his father, Armstrong supported the abolition of slavery but considered himself a Hawaiian. Nonetheless, on August 15, shortly after graduating with future General and President James A. Garfield, Armstrong volunteered to serve in the Union Army. By August 26, he had recruited a company near Troy, New York and received the rank of captain in the 125th New York Infantry, a three-years regiment in George L. Willard's brigade. Within weeks Armstrong and his troops were among the 12,000 man garrison at Harpers Ferry, who though without combat training initially held their position during the Confederate Maryland Campaign on September 13, 1862, but were surrendered two days later by career U.S. Army officer Dixon S. Miles (who was rumored to have been killed by his own men that day, but officially died as a result of enemy fire) to Confederate General Stonewall Jackson shortly before the Battle of Antietam. After being paroled in a prisoner exchange, Capt. Armstrong returned to the front lines in Virginia in December. The following summer, as part of the 3rd Division of the II Corps under Alexander Hays Armstrong fought at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, defending Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge. Armstrong subsequently received a promotion to Major on August 26, 1863 (but effective July 3, 1863, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg). Armstrong volunteered to lead African-American troops, resigned from his New York unit, and received the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and assignment to the 9th United States Colored Infantry (USCT) in November 1863. When Armstrong was assigned to command the USCT, training was conducted at Camp Stanton near Benedict, Maryland. While at Camp Stanton, Armstrong established a school to educate the black soldiers, most of whom had no education as slaves. Lt. Col. Armstrong was then assigned to lead the 8th U.S. Colored Troops when its previous commander fell wounded.Appleton's Cyclopedia vol. VI p. 668 Armstrong's experiences in Hawai'i and with these regiments aroused his interest in the welfare of black Americans. Armstrong noted that Hawaiians J. R. Kealoha and Kaiwi were privates in different USCT regiments. Armstrong led the 8th Regiment during the Siege of Petersburg, and his troops became one of the first Union regiments to enter the city after the Confederates withdrew from their trenches. In November 1864, Armstrong received a promotion to Colonel \\"for gallant and meritorious services at Deep Bottom and Fussell's Mill\\"Official Records, Series 1, Volume XLII/3 [S# 89] during the Siege of Petersburg. The 8th USCT pursued the Army of Northern Virginia during the subsequent Appomattox Campaign. After Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Armstrong and his men returned to Petersburg briefly, before being sent by sea to Ringgold Barracks near Rio Grande City on the Mexican border in Texas. On October 10, 1865, the 8th USCT began marching from Texas to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Armstrong and his men were discharged out of the military on November 10, 1865, shortly after their belated arrival. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Armstrong for the award of the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the new commission on March 12, 1866. Educator At the war's end, Armstrong joined the Freedmen's Bureau. With the help of the American Missionary Association, he established the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute‚Äînow known as Hampton University‚Äîin Hampton, Virginia in 1868. The Institute was meant to be a place where black students could receive post-secondary education to become teachers, as well as training in useful job skills while paying for their education through manual labor, as his father had advocated back in Hawai'i. Armstrong in his later life During Armstrong's career, and during Reconstruction, the prevailing concept of racial adjustment promoted by whites and African Americans equated technical and industrial training with the advancement of the black race. This idea was not a new solution and traced its history to before the American Civil War. But especially after the war, blacks and whites alike realized the paradox that freedom posed for the African American population in the racist south. Freedom meant liberation from the brutality and degradation of slavery, but as W. E. B. Du Bois described it, a black person \\"felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools, or savings, he had entered into competition with rich, landed, skilled neighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.\\" Although the end of slavery was the inevitable result of the Union victory, less obvious was the fate of millions of penniless blacks in the South. Former abolitionists and white philanthropists quickly focused their energies on stabilizing the black community, assisting the newly freed blacks to become independent, positive contributors to their community, helping them improve their race and encouraging them to strive toward a standard put forth by American whites. In the aftermath of Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831, the Virginia General Assembly passed new legislation making it unlawful to teach slaves, free blacks, or mulattoes to read or write. Similar laws were also enacted in other slave-holding states across the South. The removal of these laws after the Civil War helped draw attention to the problem of illiteracy as one of the great challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the free enterprise system and support themselves. One instrument through which this process of racial uplift could take place was schools such as the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute. The Hampton Institute exemplified the paternalistic attitudes of whites who felt it was their duty to develop those they regarded as lesser races. General Samuel Armstrong molded the curriculum to reflect his background as both a wartime abolitionist and the child of white missionaries in Hawaii. Armstrong believed that several centuries of the institution of slavery in the United States had left its blacks in an inferior moral state and only whites could help them develop to the point of American civilization. \\"The solution lay in a Hampton-style education, an education that combined cultural uplift with moral and manual training, or as Armstrong was fond of saying, an education that encompassed 'the head, the heart, and the hands.'\\" The general insisted that blacks should refrain from voting and politics because their long experience as slaves and, before that, pagans, had degraded the race beyond responsible participation in government. \\"Armstrong maintained that it was the duty of the superior white race to rule over the weaker dark-skinned races until they were appropriately civilized. This civilization process, in Armstrong's estimate, would require several generations of moral and religious development.\\" The primary means through which white civilization could be instilled in African Americans was by the moral power of labor and manual industry. At the heart of the early Hampton- style education during Armstrong's tenure was this emphasis on labor and industry. However, teaching blacks to work was a tool, not the primary goal, of the Institute. Rather than producing classes of individual craftsmen and laborers, Hampton was ultimately a normal school (teacher's school) for future black teachers. In theory, these black teachers would then apply the Hampton idea of self-help and industry at schools throughout the U.S., especially the South. To this end, a prerequisite for admission to Hampton was the intent to become a teacher. In fact, \\"approximately 84 per cent of the 723 graduates of Hampton's first twenty classes became teachers.\\" Armstrong strove to instill in these disciples the moral value of manual labor. This concept became the crucial component of Hampton's training of black educators. Booker T. Washington Perhaps the best student of Armstrong's Hampton-style education was Booker T. Washington.Heather Cox Richardson, West from Appomattox: the Reconstruction of America after the Civil War (Yale University Press2007) p. 202 After coming to the school in 1872, Washington immediately began to adopt Armstrong's teaching and philosophy. Washington described Armstrong as \\"the most perfect specimen of man, physically, mentally and spiritually the most Christ-like‚Ä¶.\\" Washington also quickly learned the aim of the Hampton Institute. After leaving Hampton, he recalled being admitted to the school, despite his ragged appearance, due to the ability he demonstrated while sweeping and dusting a room. From his first day at Hampton, Washington embraced Armstrong's idea of black education. Washington went on to attend Wayland Seminary in Washington, D.C., and he returned to Hampton to teach on Armstrong's faculty. Upon Sam Armstrong's recommendation to George W. Campbell, Lewis Adams, and Mirabeau B. Swanson, a three-man board of commissioners appointed by the Alabama Legislature, Booker Washington became in 1881 the first principal of the new normal school in Alabama, which evolved to become Tuskegee University in the 20th century. Many religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired by the work of pioneering educators such as Samuel Armstrong and Dr. Washington, to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans in the South. In his autobiography Up From Slavery, Booker T. Washington stated that what made the greatest impression on him at Hampton was General Samuel C. Armstrong, \\"the noblest, rarest human being that it has ever been my privilege to meet.\\" \\"One might have removed from Hampton all the buildings, classrooms, teachers, and industries, and given the men and women there the opportunity of coming into daily contact with General Armstrong, and that alone would have been a liberal education.\\" (Up from Slavery, Chapter III) Death and legacy Partially disabled by a stroke while on a speaking tour in 1892, Armstrong returned to Hampton in a private railroad car provided by his multimillionaire friend, Collis P. Huntington, builder of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, with whom he had collaborated on black- education projects. Armstrong died at the Hampton Institute on May 11, 1893, after suffering a second stroke. As he had requested, he was buried in the student cemetery on Hampton's campus.FindaGrave.com no.6953489 His widow returned to New England. As discussed in the family section above, all his daughters would be associated with Hampton University, and his son Daniel Armstrong would become a career Naval officer and train African American troops during World War II. His grandson, Harold Howe II, became Commissioner of Education under the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson. His papers (and those of some family members) are held by the Special Collections division of the Williams College library.https://archivesspace.williams.edu/repositories/2/resources/111 =Growth and decline of Normal Schools= As the ever-increasing numbers of new teachers went back to their communities, by the first third of the 20th century, over 5,000 local schools had been built for blacks in the South with private matching funds provided by individuals such as Henry H. Rogers, Andrew Carnegie, and most notably, Julius Rosenwald, each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy. Dr. Washington later wrote that, by requiring matching funds, the benefactors felt they were also addressing self-esteem. The recipients locally would have a stake in knowing that they were helping themselves through their own hard work and sacrifice. In many communities, the histories of the so-called Rosenwald schools reflect that to have proved true. In time, the normal schools which had been originally established primarily to work with blacks at Hampton, Tuskegee, and elsewhere evolved from their primary focus on industrial training, practical skills, and basic literacy, into institutions of higher education focused not only upon training teachers, but upon teaching diverse academic subjects. Many of those institutions evolved into fully accredited universities. =Namesakes= Armstrong High School in Richmond, Virginia, was named after Armstrong in 1909. Armstrong Manual Training School in Washington, DC was named for him in 1902. It was renamed Veterans High School in 1958, and then the Armstrong Adult Education Center in 1964. It currently hosts Friendship Armstrong Academy. US Army Fort Armstrong, (Hawaii) built just before World War I, was a coastal artillery battery guarding Honolulu harbor. Part of the land was used for the Prince Kuhio Federal Building. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies, which still uses the name. A building and alumni award for humanitarian contributions were named for him at Punahou School. Armstrong Hall (Science Building) at Tuskegee University was named after Armstrong in 1929.

These are also known as Sabbath or Shabbos elevators. Description and history Jewish law forbids those who observe it from undertaking various forms of \\"work\\" on the Sabbath, including that they may not create sparks or fires. In recent times, this has been extrapolated to also cover the operation of electrical equipment. An elevator may be marked with a sign noting that it is specially configured for Shabbat observance. There are several ways the elevator works (going up and down), stopping at every floor, stopping at alternate floors, or rising to the top floor and stopping, while going down. Shabbat elevators can be found in areas of large Jewish population in Israel, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ukraine (Dnipro), Argentina, and Brazil. They are found in hotels, hospitals and other health institutions, apartment buildings, and sometimes in synagogues. The Israeli Knesset passed a special Shabbat elevator law in 2001, ordering the planning and building of all residential buildings, and public buildings which have more than one elevator, to install a control mechanism for Shabbat (Shabbat module) in one of the elevators. In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step in and out without having to press any buttons. Otherwise, Jewish law prohibits observers from using an elevator on Shabbat in the usual manner, because pressing the button to operate the elevator closes a circuit, which is one of the activities prohibited on Shabbat and may also indirectly lead to \\"writing\\" of the new floor number in the display. In 2009, some Haredi rabbis, led by Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, published a religious injunction forbidding the use of Shabbat elevators. Some interpreters believe that a non-Jew is known as a \\"Shabbos goy\\" may not be employed to press the buttons and hold the door for Jewish people, in buildings that do not have Shabbat elevators, unless the Jew has great difficulty using the stairs themselves. As discussed in that article, a non-Jew is not expected to keep the Sabbath like a Jew. Therefore, Jewish law holds that a Jew may benefit from work performed by a non-Jew only if the non-Jew performs this work for his own good and of his own free will. A borderline case is when a Jew hints to a non-Jew that he wants him to perform a certain service without explicitly asking him. These borderline cases are not considered legitimate by many Orthodox rabbis. Criticism There are three categories of criticism against using a Shabbat elevator: =Elevators may be prohibited anyway= Some halakhic authorities rule that this classic Shabbat elevator does not fully overcome the relevant halakhic issues. Among other things, a person's weight on a downward-traveling elevator can be considered to partly cause the elevator's descent, and, therefore, the activation of all electric circuits which come into play as a result of it. Thus, when a person ascends in an elevator, the motor that moves the counterweight down and the elevator car up is operating to counteract the rider's weight, which is a hindrance to make operation of the elevator require more work-energy. However, when a person descends an elevator, the person's weight helps move the elevator in the downward direction, so the person is considered physically to cause the elevator to move down. Accordingly, some authorities permit ascending in an elevator, but prohibit descending. The movement of an elevator may also indirectly cause other events to take place that are forbidden under Jewish law. For example, in many systems, one light turns off, and another light turns on, as the elevator passes from one floor to the next. Some commentators find that turning on incandescent floor lights violates a Biblical prohibition against kindling a fire on the Sabbath.Exodus 35:3. Torah Exodus 35:3 The Zomet Institute and the Institute for Science and Halacha modify elevators to avoid these issues. =Permitted, but discouraged= An elevator in a Shabbat mode is an example of a legal workaround, where seemingly \\"forbidden\\" acts can be performed by modifying the relevant technology to such an extent that no law is actually violated. Usage of a Shabbat elevator by those who are otherwise capable is considered by some rabbinical authorities as a \\"violation\\" of Shabbat; therefore, many Orthodox Jews might prefer to walk up or down the stairs instead of taking an elevator. =Energy waste from continuous operation= In comparison to a normal elevator, which remains stationary until needed, Shabbat mode has the side effect of wasting considerable amounts of energy, needlessly running the elevator car sequentially up and down every floor of a building, repeatedly servicing floors where it is not needed. For a tall building with many floors, the car must move on a frequent enough basis so as to not cause undue delay for potential users who will not touch the controls as it opens the doors on every floor up the building.

As of the 21st century, the area has been redeveloped and gentrified, with occupants of the Spencer Dock development including the Convention Centre Dublin, PricewaterhouseCoopers' Irish headquarters, Credit Suisse and TMF Group. The Central Bank of Ireland and NTMA have offices in the nearby Dublin Landings development. History The dock was constructed in 1873 to accommodate the coal ships and other barges primarily of the Midland Great Western Railway Company and served as both a railway and canal depot. The original Spencer Drawbridge was constructed in 1873 but replaced by Sheriff Street Lifting Bridge in 1941. It was named for John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The dockland area was originally part of the end of the Royal Canal, which still reaches the River Liffey here. Spencer Dock comprises the part of North Wall between Guild Street, Upper Sheriff Street, New Wapping Street and North Wall Quay, as well as Docklands railway station. Most of the 206,000 m¬≤ (51 acre) site was owned by C√≥ras Iompair √âireann. CI√â sold it for development because the former freight yards there were no longer needed. The site was then developed by Treasury Holdings. Park A park development project in the area, originally proposed to be named \\"North Lotts Park\\", was cancelled and instead a smaller park, Central Square Park, was opened in 2014 near Spencer Dock Luas station. The park hosts weekly food markets and other small events. Transport =Rail= Spencer Dock is served by the Docklands railway station on Sheriff Street, at the north end of the site. Commuter services to the Dublin Docklands area on the Western Commuter line began in March 2007. Under the Transport 21 initiative, at one time due for completion by 2018, the station was to move south to a permanent location along New Wapping Street. This station was to connect to the DART network via the Interconnector tunnel and to the extended LUAS Red line. However, this project was deferred, due to the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn. =Luas= The Luas Red Line which runs from Tallaght or Saggart to The Point (via Bus√°ras and Heuston Railway station) has a Spencer Dock stop.

(LOC 89-85644) Its original route ran from Marietta through Vincent, Athens, Hamden, Chillicothe, Greenfield, Blanchester, and Loveland. It had two main branches: Blanchester to Hillsboro, which was originally part of the Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad; and Hamden to Portsmouth, Ohio, originally part of the Scioto and Hocking Valley Railroad. The M&C; was founded as the Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad (B&C;) in 1845 The destination of the B&C; was changed from Belpre to Marietta, Ohio, and in 1851 the name of the railroad was changed to The Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad. The M&C; reached Loveland, Ohio by 1857. The company entered bankruptcy in 1858, from which it emerged in 1860. The first through- train from Cincinnati, using the tracks of The Little Miami Railroad to reach Loveland, ran on April 9, 1857. An extension of the right-of-way from Marietta upriver to Bellaire, Ohio, to enable a connection across the Ohio River with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Wheeling, Virginia, had been largely graded with stone culverts constructed by the 1858 bankruptcy. Construction stopped. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) later purchased the right-of-way between Bellaire and Marietta. The Northwestern Virginia Railroad, financed and controlled by the B&O;, was built from a junction with the B&O; mainline at Grafton, Virginia to Parkersburg, Virginia and opened May 1, 1857.Carroll Bateman, The Baltimore And Ohio(Baltimore: Baltimore & Ohio Railroad) 1951 The M&C; operated a ferry for the 14 miles downriver from Marietta to Parkersburg, so that travelers and freight could be transferred between the systems.

Its history has very ancient roots which date back to the 10th century, and for almost five hundred years it was the capital of Stato Pallavicino. The first written sources the name \\"Busseto\\" were in the form of \\"Buxetum\\", which dates from the early twelfth century. It is believed that the town's name derives from \\"buxus\\" (meaning boxwood) or, in another form, as \\"busetum\\" (an enclosure for oxen). The \\"Rocca\\", the fortress was built in the time of Adalberto Pallavicini, founder of the family, in the eleventh century. In the first half of the thirteenth century, it was completely rebuilt and surrounded by a moat and a drawbridge linking it to the square. In time, however, it was destroyed and rebuilt several times and then lost the drawbridge and part of the walls. In 1857 it was again rebuilt almost entirely in the neo-Gothic style by architect Pier Luigi Montecchini. The present-day Rocca has preserved the original keep and the main tower. La Rocca, within which lies the Teatro Verdi, it is now the Municipal Palace, the seat of the municipality of Busseto. Notable residents Opera composer Giuseppe Verdi was born in the nearby village of Le Roncole in 1813 and he moved to the town in 1824. Other figures from the world of opera are associated with the town: until his death, retired tenor Carlo Bergonzi owned the hotel I due Foscari, which also hosts the Accademia Verdiana. Bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni grew up there from the age of four after his family moved to Busseto in 1979, where his father owned a car-repair firm and his mother was a teacher.Picard, Anna. \\"People: 418.

These include: =Le Roncole= The nearby village of Le Roncole was Verdi's birthplace on 10 October 1813. The house has been a national monument since 1901.Mordacci 2001 =Casa Barezzi= Close by the main square is the home of Antonio Barezzi, the man who supported his early endeavours. He became both Verdi's patron and his father-in-law. In the upstairs lounge, the young Verdi gave his first public performance in 1830 and continued to frequent the house until the death of his benefactor. The first portrait of Verdi and an oil depicting Antonio Barezzi is on display in the house. Verdi's letters are also on display. The Casa Barezzi is the headquarters of the Friends of Verdi; the organization oversaw the restoration of the building in 1979 and 1998. Since 2001, there has been a permanent exhibition of objects and documents related to Verdi and his relationship to the Barezzi family. =Churches of Santa Maria degli Angeli and San Michele Arcangelo= Both churches are nearby. These are where Verdi played the organ. =Palazzo Orlandi= This is the house which Verdi bought in 1845. He lived there with Giuseppina Strepponi, not yet his wife, from 1849 to 1851. Verdi composed Luisa Miller, Stiffelio and Rigoletto while living there. \\"Parma - Busseto - Palazzo Orlandi\\" on giuseppeverdi.it.

The Warrior started life as the MCV-80, \\"Mechanised Combat Vehicle for the 1980s\\". One of the requirements of the new vehicle was a top speed able to keep up with the projected new MBT, the MBT-80 - later cancelled and replaced by what became the Challenger 1 - which the then-current FV432 could not. The project was begun in 1972. GKN Defence won the production contract in 1984 and the Warrior was accepted for service with the British Army in November 1984. GKN Defence was purchased by BAE Systems, via Alvis plc. A total of 789 FV510 and variants were manufactured for the British Army, and 254 of a modified version (Desert Warrior) were produced for the Kuwaiti Army. Description The Warrior incorporates several design features in keeping with the UK's battlefield experience. In particular, there are no firing ports in the hull, in line with British thinking that the role of the armoured personnel carrier/infantry fighting vehicle (APC/IFV) is to carry troops under protection to the objective and then give firepower support when they have disembarked. The absence of firing ports also allows additional appliqu√© armour to be fitted to the sides of the vehicle, which is invariably applied to Warriors involved in active operations. The cage armour used at one stage was replaced in 2007 by \\"Wrap Two\\" appliqu√© armour. The basic armour provides all-around protection against small arms ball ammunition. FV510 Warrior in desert camouflage, with appliqu√© armour fitted, and infantry section's personal kit and other equipment outside. The crew of a Warrior comprises the driver, seated in the front hull, and the gunner and commander, who are both seated in the turret. The embarked infantry section can number up to seven soldiers, who are seated facing each other in the rear hull compartment. Passenger access is through a single electric ram powered door at the rear of the hull, rather than a drop-down ramp as in the US M113 APC and M2 Bradley IFV. Warrior Section Vehicles are able to carry and support seven fully equipped soldiers together with supplies and weapons, including a number of anti-tank weapons, for a 48-hour battlefield day in nuclear/biological/chemical conditions. A Warrior on Salisbury Plain during Exercise Lion Strike The Warrior is driven by a Perkins-Rolls-Royce V8 Condor engine through a four-speed automatic gearbox. It is capable of a road speed of . The Warrior has the speed and performance to keep up with a Challenger 2 main battle tank over the most difficult terrain. The vehicle is fitted with a two-man GKN Sankey turret, armed with a non-stabilized L21A1 30 mm RARDEN cannon capable of destroying some APCs at a maximum range of , and an L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm Hughes Helicopters coaxial chain gun. It is fitted with two clusters of four defensive grenade launchers (usually used with Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke ‚Äì VIRSS). All Warrior Infantry Section Vehicles are now equipped with Bowman radios, which replaced the earlier Clansman radios, for enhanced communications, command and control. When first introduced, the vehicles were fitted with passive image intensifier night vision sights. These have since been progressively replaced with Thales Optronics Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) sights to upgrade night fighting capabilities, with 8x magnification. As of 2007, 350 vehicles were fitted with BGTI. Combat history * Operation Granby (Gulf War) * Operation Grapple (United Nations duties in Bosnia with the UNPROFOR) * Operation Resolute (NATO IFOR (Implementation Force) Bosnia 1996) * Operation Telic (Iraq from 2003) * Operation Herrick (Afghanistan with ISAF) The protection against small arms, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank mines was shown during the UN operations in Bosnia. Two Warriors were destroyed during the First Gulf War, with nine soldiers killed, in a friendly fire incident when hit by an AGM-65 Maverick launched in error by an American A-10 Thunderbolt II. As of 17 November 2008, 22 soldiers had been killed while travelling in Warrior IFVs in Afghanistan or Iraq. On 7 March 2012, six British soldiers were killed in an explosion that hit a Warrior IFV in Helmand. Variants * FV510 Infantry Section Vehicle. This is the principal version operated by the British Army, as described above. 489 were produced (including 105 as platforms for the mobility of ATGW teams, originally equipped with MILAN and later with Javelin). * FV511 Infantry Command Vehicle. 84 of these were produced. FV512 Mechanised Combat Repair Vehicle * FV512 Mechanised Combat Repair Vehicle. Operated by REME detachments in Armoured Infantry battalions. It is equipped with a 6.5-tonne crane plus power tools and is able to tow a trailer carrying two Warrior power packs or one Challenger power pack. 105 of these were produced. * FV513 Mechanised Recovery Vehicle (Repair). Also operated by REME detachments in Armoured Infantry battalions. It is equipped with a 20-tonne winch and 6.5-tonne crane plus power tools and (like the FV512) is able to tow a trailer carrying two Warrior power packs or one Challenger power pack. 39 of these were produced. * FV514 Mechanised Artillery Observation Vehicle. This is operated by the Royal Artillery as an Artillery Observation Post Vehicle (OPV) and is fitted with mast-mounted Man-packable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR) and Position and Azimuth Determining System (PADS), with Image Intensifying and Infra-Red equipment. The only armament is the 7.62 mm machine gun, as the 30 mm Rarden cannon is replaced by a dummy weapon. This allows space for the targeting and surveillance equipment while still keeping largely the same outward appearance of a standard Warrior in order to avoid becoming a priority target. 52 of these were produced. * FV515 Battery Command Vehicle. This is operated by the Royal Artillery. 19 of these were produced. * Desert Warrior. This was an export version adapted for operations in hostile desert conditions. It was fitted with the Delco turret as used on the LAV-25 wheeled IFV, mounting a stabilised M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain gun with coaxial 7.62 mm chain gun and 2 x Hughes TOW ATGM launchers (one mounted on each side). In 1993, Kuwait purchased 254 Desert Warrior vehicles. * Warrior 2000. This was a new version developed for the Swiss Army. It did not enter production. It featured an all-welded aluminium hull, increased armour, digital fire control system and more powerful engine. It was fitted with the Delco turret, or a Land Systems Hagglunds E30 turret with Alliant Techsystems Bushmaster II Mk 44 30 mm cannon. * Armoured Ambulance. Six Warriors, with armaments removed, were converted to armoured ambulances for use in Afghanistan during Operation Herrick. * VERDI-2 (Vehicle Electronics Research Defence Initiative) was a technology demonstrator built on the hull of an FV510 in 1993. It utilized the CTAi 40mm cannon, in addition to eight Starstreak missiles in two quad launchers, as well as the ADAD system later seen on the Stormer HVM. It did not enter production. Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme FV513 Mechanised Recovery Vehicle (Repair) in a live- fire training exercise, 6 January 1991. Upgrades already fitted to Warriors in British Army service included the Bowman Communications System and Thales Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) night sights. However the British Army determined that a bigger upgrade programme was required to extend its service life to 2040. The Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (WCSP) will involve upgrading 380 Warriors with the Warrior Modular Protection System (WMPS) and Warrior Enhanced Electronic Architecture (WEEA). Within that group, 245 vehicles will also be fitted with a new turret and weapon system under the Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Program (WFLIP). The remainder, which will be designated as Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicles (ABSV), will lack turrets and carry out field repair and recovery roles using a winch and crane attachments. BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin competed for the WCSP contracts. Lockheed Martin's WFLIP upgrade was based on the existing Warrior turret. BAE Systems designed a new turret. In March 2011, it was announced that Lockheed Martin had effectively won the competition to develop both the WFLIP and the FRES turrets. Severe budgetary pressures made it uncertain whether these defence projects were to be delayed or curtailed, but it was announced in October 2011 that the Warrior upgrades would proceed at a cost of ¬£1bn, extending the service life of the Warrior to 2040 and beyond. The scheduled in-service date for upgraded Warriors was 2018. Under the WFLI program, the present turret mounting the RARDEN cannon, which lacks stabilisation and is manually loaded with three-round clips, will be replaced by a turret that will mount a stabilised 40 mm weapon developed by the Anglo- French firm CTA International and firing Cased telescoped ammunition. This weapon will also equip the Ajax armoured vehicle. As of March 2020, Warrior CSP is the \\"demonstration phase\\", demonstrating capability for a range of military missions set by the MoD. A total of ¬£430m has been spent so far. No in-service date has been set, but the demonstration phase is due to finish in 2021. In June 2020 the House of Commons Defence Select Committee described the project as running over three years late and ¬£227 million over budget.

Latvian diplomats who were stationed in embassies and consulates at the moment of the occupation in 1940, refused to recognize the occupation and return to Soviet Latvia. They continued to formally represent the interests of Latvia in countries that did not recognize the Soviet annexation. After the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, the diplomats started reporting to the restored Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Background Latvia was occupied on June 17, 1940, by Red Army troops and officially annexed to the Soviet Union on August 5, 1940 in the form of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. One month before the occupation, on 17 May 1940 the Cabinet of Ministers granted extraordinary powers to KƒÅrlis Zari≈Ü≈°, Latvia‚Äôs Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Mr. Zari≈Ü≈° was authorised to defend Latvia‚Äôs interests, supervise the work of Latvia‚Äôs representations abroad and handle their finances and property. This created a legal basis for the functioning of the diplomatic service in the absence of a legal government in Latvia.\\"ON GUARD FOR LATVIA'S STATEHOOD\\" Latvia's Foreign Service Staff in Exile During the Years of Occupation June 17, 1941 - August 21, 1991 - Official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia The United States never recognized the forcible and illegal annexation of the Baltic States in conformity with the principles of the Stimson Doctrine (US Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles‚Äôs Declaration of July 23, 1940), and more than 50 countries followed this position. The work of the diplomatic service was financed from Latvian gold reserves in foreign banks. Activity During the occupation, Latvian diplomatic missions continued their work in Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Latvian diplomatic service regularly issued official statements regarding the illegality of the Soviet occupation and annexation of Latvia as well as regarding Latvia‚Äôs right to restore its national independence. It was also protecting the interests of Latvian citizens abroad and the Latvian property abroad. In 1947 a joint communication on the occupation of Baltic states to the UN was sent by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian diplomats abroad. The Baltic Appeal to the United Nations (now \\"Baltic Association to the United Nations\\") was formed in 1966. On March 26, 1949, the US State Department issued a circular stating that the Baltic states were still independent nations with their own diplomatic representatives. In 1969 Latvian Counselor to the US Anatols Dinbergs signed on behalf of the Latvian nation among leaders of 73 countries around the world the Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages.Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages at NASA Nevertheless, Latvia was not allowed to establish a government-in-exile in any Western country or sign the Declaration of the United Nations (1942), as Latvian diplomats wished. The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued formal protests against the Baltic diplomatic missions remaining open in Washington DC and elsewhere.Hiden, pp. 63‚Äì64 In Canada the official list of diplomats included the offices of the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that in the early 1960s caused the Soviet Embassy in Canada to refuse to receive the lists distributed by the Canadian Department of External Affairs. Eventually, the UK excluded the Baltic diplomats from the Diplomatic List, but as a compromise Baltic diplomats continued to be accepted as possessing a diplomatic character by His/Her Majesty's Governments.James T. McHugh, James S. Pacy, p.101 The Latvian diplomatic service in exile actively cooperated with organizations of the Latvian diaspora in joint efforts to keep Western countries from formally recognizing Latvia‚Äôs annexation by the USSR. The existence of the exiled diplomatic service was another demonstration of the illegality of the annexation. Transition of mandate after restoration of independence The exiled diplomatic service of Latvia played an important role during the restoration of independence of Latvia in 1988 - 1990 and in ensuring the legal continuity between the newly independent Latvian state and the interwar Latvian Republic. Latvia's parliament officially restored the country‚Äôs full independence on the 21 August 1991 in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt. Wide international recognition of restored independence started after that, and the legations and consulates of the exiled diplomatic service were transferred to the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The male is easily recognized by its bright blue head and back (lighter than the closely related indigo bunting), its conspicuous white wingbars, and its light rusty breast and white belly. The color pattern may suggest the eastern and western bluebirds, but the smaller size (13-15 cm or 5-5.9 inches long), wingbars, and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it. The female is brown, grayer above and warmer underneath, told from the female indigo bunting by two thin and pale wingbars and other plumage details. The song is a high, rapid, strident warble, similar to that of the indigo bunting but longer and with less repetition. Upper figure, male; lower, female Lazuli buntings breed mostly west of the 100th meridian from southern Canada to northern Texas, central New Mexico and Arizona, and southern California. On the Pacific coast their breeding range extends south to extreme northwestern Baja California. They migrate to southeastern Arizona and Mexico. Their habitat is brushy areas and sometimes weedy pastures, generally well-watered, and sometimes in towns. These birds eat mostly seeds and insects. They may feed conspicuously on the ground or in bushes, but singing males are often very elusive in treetops. This bird makes a loose cup nest of grasses and rootlets placed in a bush. It lays three or four pale blue eggs. In the eastern and southern part of its range, it often hybridizes with the indigo bunting.

Biography Lansdale, born in Washington, D.C., graduated as Passed Midshipman from the Naval Academy 18 June 1879. Commissioned ensign 1 June 1881, he served on Asiatic, North Atlantic, and with the Mediterranean and Pacific Squadrons. Promoted to lieutenant 15 May 1893, he became executive officer of Philadelphia upon her recommissioning at San Francisco 9 July 1898. After visiting Honolulu for ceremonies which transferred the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Islands to the United States, Philadelphia, flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Kautz, Commander, Pacific Station, arrived Apia, Samoa, 6 March 1899. An unstable political climate, created by rival Samoan factions and German presence, erupted into open hostility during the month. A combined American and British naval force sought to keep the peace, but natives attacked American and British consulates late in March. A British and American landing party set out from Apia in late March. On 1 April during a mission to drive off the forces under King Mataafa. With Lieutenant Lansdale in command, the landing party was ambushed and forced to retreat after a fierce fight near Vailele. While protecting the evacuation of a mortally wounded machinegunner, Lieutenant Lansdale was seriously wounded, his right leg shattered by an enemy bullet. Aided by two enlisted men, Ensign John R. Monaghan carried him until he dropped from exhaustion. Despite Lansdale's plea, ‚ÄúMonny, you leave me now, I cannot go any further,‚Äù Ensign Monaghan remained beside the fallen lieutenant. With only one rifle between them, they were soon overrun by pursuing Mataafan Samoan forces; both officers died on the spot. Seaman Norman Edsall and another sailor also were killed.

The album features touched-up versions of B-sides and previously unreleased recordings from the band's recording sessions from 1984 to 1993. The album charted at number 9 on the Billboard 200 and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Overview After releasing only five albums over the course of a twelve-year period, Def Leppard used Retro Active to break that habit, provide a treat for diehard fans, and close the door on the \\"Steve Clark\\" era of the band. Many of the tracks had previously been released as single B-sides. According to singer Joe Elliott, the concept behind the album was envisioned after the success of the \\"Two Steps Behind\\" single. The song had originally been demoed solely by Elliott as an electric version in 1989, and was subsequently recorded by the band as an acoustic ballad at the suggestion of guitarist Phil Collen. When the producers of the film Last Action Hero contacted the band in 1993 to provide a new song for the soundtrack, the band were unable to record new material due to touring schedules and instead sent over the multitrack tape of the acoustic version of \\"Two Steps Behind\\", which was given strings by conductor Michael Kamen in April 1993 and included onto the film soundtrack. It would become the band's last Top 20 single in the US, reaching No. 12, and inspired the band to put the album together and re-record the electric version of the song. \\"She's Too Tough\\" and the electric version of \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" were both B-sides included as bonus tracks on Japanese pressings of Adrenalize. Written in 1985, \\"She's Too Tough\\" first appeared on the Helix album Wild in the Streets in 1987. \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", meanwhile, was first written and demoed by guitarist Collen in 1991 and was originally recorded by the Law, a band featuring Paul Rodgers and the Who drummer Kenney Jones, for their self-titled album in 1991. Def Leppard later recorded their own version in April the following year, which they released as a B-side on the \\"Make Love Like a Man\\" single. After the band had recorded the new vocal, bass and drum parts for the electric version of the song, Collen overheard Elliott experimenting with the song on a piano. This led Elliott to record a piano and vocal version of the song, after which Collen, bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen added acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitar and drum parts in June 1993, creating the acoustic version that would be released as a single. Two unfinished songs from the Hysteria recording sessions, \\"Desert Song\\" and \\"Fractured Love\\", were completed exclusively for the album. The album also features several covers, namely Sweet's \\"Action\\" (which charted higher than the original in the UK) and Mick Ronson's \\"Only After Dark\\". The version of \\"Ride into the Sun\\" on the compilation is not the same as that which appeared on The Def Leppard E.P., but rather the 1987 re-recording. It differs slightly from the original B-side from the Hysteria era; the B-side featured a Rick Allen drum solo intro, whereas the version on Retro Active has a piano intro provided by Ian Hunter. Retro Active features a hidden (final) track: a piano/vocal version of \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", which also features an alternate acoustic guitar solo by Collen. This is the first Def Leppard album to feature songs recorded with newly added guitarist Vivian Campbell. The album saw the release of six singles, three of which were released commercially: Two Steps Behind, Miss You In A Heartbeat and Action (all three appeared on the 'Make Love Like A Man' single in one form or another). Specifically released for radio promotion only were: Desert Song, She's Too Tough and From The Inside. Desert Song was the only track released that didn't have a prior release as a b-side. Artwork was produced by the From The Inside radio single which was quite unusual. Album cover The album cover, by Nels Israelson and Hugh Syme, is a photograph of a lady sitting at a dressing table, looking in a mirror. However, if the cover is viewed at arm's length or from a distance, it takes the form of a skull (a type of vanitas art), the woman's head forming the left eye socket, and her reflected head in the mirror forming the right eye socket. The mirror itself forms the shape of the skull and the accessories on the dressing table form the nose, nostrils and teeth. It was inspired by Charles Allan Gilbert's most famous work, All Is Vanity (1892). An alternate version of the album cover exists, only released for promotional use. The only difference is the Def Leppard' logo is represented in the most traditional style seen on 'Pyromania', 'Hysteria' and 'Adrenalize'. The band felt that given Retro Active's sonically darker tone, that it would be best to shelve the bright colours of the logo.

The term \\"universal design\\" was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb ‚Äì now a standard feature of the built environment. Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier- free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example. Color- contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another. There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that \\"kneel\\" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts. Principles The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University expounds the following principles: # Equitable use # Flexibility in use # Simple and intuitive # Perceptible information # Tolerance for error # Low physical effort # Size and space for approach and use Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital. These principles are broader than those of accessible design and barrier-free design. Goals of universal design In 2012, the Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at the University at Buffalo expanded definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed. # Body Fit # Comfort # Awareness # Understanding # Wellness # Social Integration # Personalization # Cultural Appropriateness The first four goals are oriented to human performance: anthropometry, biomechanics, perception, cognition. Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook \\"Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments.\\" Examples * Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs * Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force * Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047 * Wide interior doors (3'0\\"), hallways, and alcoves with 60\\" √ó 60\\" turning space at doors and dead-ends * Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components * Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs * Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations * Components that do not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist * Components that require less than 5 pounds of force to operate * Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches * Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch * Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting * Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays * Visual output redundant with information in auditory output * Contrast controls on visual output * Use of meaningful icons with text labels * Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound * Volume controls on auditory output * Speed controls on auditory output * Choice of language on speech output * Ramp access in swimming pools * Closed captioning on television networks * Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast * Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images * Instruction that presents material both orally and visually * Labels in large print on equipment control buttons * A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions Design standards In 1960, specifications for barrier free design were published. It was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard, A1171.1 was published. It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals. The research started in 1949 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and continues to this day. The principal investigator is Dr. Timothy Nugent (his name is listed in the front of the 1961, 1971, 1980 standard). In 1949 Dr. Nugent also started the National Wheelchair Basketball Association. This ANSI A117.1 standard was adopted by the US federal government General Services Administration under 35 FR 4814 - 3/20/70, 39 FR 23214 - 6/27/74, 43 FR 16478 ABA- 4/19/78, 44 FR 39393 7/6/79, 46 FR 39436 8/3/81, in 1984 for UFAS and then in 1990 for ADA. The archived research documents are at the International Code Council (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. Nugent made presentations around the globe in the late 1950s and 1960s presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design. Another comprehensive publication by the Royal Institute of British Architects published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by Selwyn Goldsmith UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder. Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities. In October 2003, representatives from China, Japan, and South Korea met in Beijing and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. The International Organization for Standardization, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, and the International Electrotechnical Commission have developed: * CEN/CENELEC Guide 6. Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities (Identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71, but free for download) * ISO 21542: 2011 - Construction - Accessibility and Usability of the Built Environment (available in English and French) *ISO 20282-1:2006 Ease of operation of everyday products -- Part 1: Design requirements for context of use and user characteristics - Ease of operation of everyday products -- Part 1: Context of use and user characteristics *ISO/TS 20282-2:2013 Usability of consumer products and products for public use -- Part 2: Summative test method accessed 14 November 2016 \\\\- Usability of consumer products and products for public use‚ÄîPart 2: Summative test method, published 1 August 2013. Design for All The term Design for All (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. \\"Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality\\" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the European Commission, it \\"encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the elderly and people with disabilities, as much as the teenage techno wizard.\\" The origin of Design for All lies in the field of barrier free accessibility for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design. =Background= Design for All has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe.European Commission: Design for All (DfA). Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances. Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user- friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users (\\"stakeholders\\") in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations. =Examples= The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book Dise√±os para todos/Designs for All published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT:Feo, Roberto & Hurtado, Rosario & Optimastudio Dise√±os para Todos/Designs for All Madrid 2008 Downloadable free version of Designs for All * Audiobook * Automatic door * Electric Toothbrush * Flexible drinking straw * Google * Low-floor bus * Q-Drums * Tactile paving * Trolley case (roll along suitcase) * Velcro Other useful items for those with mobility limitations: * Washlet * Wireless remote controlled power sockets * Wireless remote controlled window shades =In information and communication technology (ICT)= Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the Information society. The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone. =European DfA organizational networks= In Europe, people have joined in networks to promote and develop Design for All: *The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN)European Design for All eAccessibility Network was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks. *EIDD - Design for All Europe is a NGO and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries. * EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach. The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym ‚ÄúInfo-Handicap‚Äù) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the European Concept for Accessibility (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents. The \\"Barrier-Free\\" concept ' building modification consists of modifying buildings or facilities so that they can be used by people who are disabled or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: Barrierefreiheit; Finnish: Esteett√∂myys), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as \\"accessibility\\" and \\"handicapped accessible\\" dominate in regular everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a ramp for wheelchairs alongside or in place of steps. In late 1990s any element which could make the use of the environment inconvenient was considered a barrier, for example poor public street lighting. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access. Freeing a building of barriers means: * Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people * Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairments * Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail * Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes Barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Guidelines - a law focusing on all building aspects, products and design that is based on the concept of respecting human rights \\\\- don't make specifications. An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier- free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all of 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.

The Menntask√≥linn √° Akureyri traces its roots to the ancient school in H√≥lar in Hjaltadalur valley, founded in the beginning of J√≥n √ñgmundsson's episcopacy in 1130. Operation of that school was discontinued in 1802 but a campaign to reopen the school of the 'Northland' was soon launched. Success came in 1880 when a 'learned school' was opened at M√∂√∞ruvellir in the valley of H√∂rg√°rdalur. The building in M√∂√∞ruvellir burnt down in 1902 and the school was moved to Akureyri, where it is currently located. Today the Junior College is attended by about 700 pupils every year, and on the national day of Iceland, 17 June, approximately 120 students graduate yearly. The Junior College's headmaster is J√≥n M√°r H√©√∞insson. Tryggvi G√≠slason (born 11 June 1938) was headmaster of Akureyri Junior College from 1973 to 2003. Tryggvi graduated with a mag. art. degree and taught Icelandic at the University of Bergen in Norway. The College is based on tradition. A few of these are: * Singing: A few times each semester, students gather outside the headmaster's office to sing for him. If they sing well enough, he grants the students permission to skip the next class and gather in the auditorium to sing. () * No alcohol: All gatherings in the name of the school are alcohol free. Almost all students respect this and consider it something that distinguishes their school from others in Iceland. * Different school year: As in other schools in Iceland this one has two terms, an autumn term and a spring term; but this school has its autumn exams after Christmas, while most other schools have the exams before Christmas.

It straddles the Little Miami River in Deerfield and Hamilton Townships. It is located about two miles southwest of Hopkinsville, two miles west of Maineville, and two miles northeast of Twenty Mile Stand just off U.S. Route 22/State Route 3, the 3C Highway. (In the 1930s, the State of Ohio erected a new high bridge over the river that bypassed the community.) The community is in the Kings Local School District and is served by the Maineville post office. The settlement was originally called Foster's Crossing. The community was named after the local Foster family. The Little Miami Bike Trail, which runs from Milford to Spring Valley, runs through the community on the eastern shore of the Little Miami River. Arts and culture The Monkey Bar and Grille, also known as the Train Stop Inn, is located on the east side of the Little Miami River and was once a three-story hotel called The Blue Danube. It stood next to the Little Miami Railroad, which is now a bike trail. The hotel was located at Foster's train stop and covered bridge. Train passengers traveled north and south while horse and wagons passed east and west, hence the reason \\"Foster's Crossing\\" got its name. Years later, around 1975, the hotel became a tavern and a local favorite \\"watering hole\\" which featured a cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking chimp named Sam. Fosters Earthworks (private property) is located on a wooded hilltop site on the west side of the river across from the Monkey Bar and Grille.

Their fossils are found chiefly in the northeastern United States, southwestern Ontario, and in Morocco.  Description  Phacops rana fossils Phacops rana can be recognized by its large eyes (which remind some observers of a frog's eyes‚Äîthe specific name rana is a reference to a common frog), its fairly large size (up to 6 inches long), and its habit of rolling up into a ball like a pill bug (\\"volvation\\"). In order to protect themselves from predators, Phacops rana would roll into a ball with its hard exoskeleton on the outside as protection. Many other trilobites possessed the same ability, but Phacops rana nearly perfected it. The slightest amount of sediment would trigger their senses, and Phacops rana would be hidden in a tiny shelter made of its own body. Although this safety feature often helped them to evade predators, occasionally it backfired and the trilobite would be buried under heavy sediment. Their fossils can still be found in balled-up positions 400 million years later.  Fossilisation  Phacops rana is found both in the northeastern U.S. and in Morocco; North America was attached to the African plate during the Devonian. Because of its abundance and popularity with collectors, Phacops rana was designated the Pennsylvania state fossil by the state's General Assembly on December 5, 1988.  Phacopid eyes  Enrolled Phacops rana from an outcrop of the Middle Devonian Mahantango Formation near Milesburg, Pennsylvania, with schizochroal eye visible The most striking feature of the morphology of Phacops rana and its relatives is their eyes. These differed from the eyes of most trilobites in having comparatively few lenses spaced between deep sclera. The lenses themselves were very rounded instead of largely flat. The eyes were mounted on turret-like structures which could swivel, providing the animal with an almost 360-degree field of view. This type of eye is known as the schizochroal eye.

The term has also been used as an elaborate way of referring to common domestic cats of Europe, causing some confusion as the pedigree cats of this breed also should resemble the typical domestic cats of Europe. In WCF a similar breed is known as Celtic Shorthair and was at a time considered the same breed, but this breed has some difference from the Europeans, and the WCF now register true Europeans under this breed name instead of under Celtic Shorthair. The role as the cat breed resembling the original domestic cats of Europe was held until the beginning of the 20th century by the British Shorthair, even though stockier than the majority of common European cats, until 1949 when the European Shorthair was recognized by the F√©d√©ration internationale f√©line (FIFe). The oldest known European Shorthair registered in FIFe was born in 1940, as the origin of the European Shorthair predates the formation of FIFe in 1949. Breed standards describing the European Shorthair as an established breed can be found in different cat books from the 1930s. Origin European Shorthair has its counterparts in Great Britain (British Shorthair) and the U.S. (American Shorthair), though these breeds have been bred for longer. The British Shorthair, however, was crossed with the Persian and selectively bred to become a cobbier cat with a slightly shortened muzzle and thicker coat. It was confusing for Scandinavian breeders that the British Shorthair was also called European Shorthair at that time, even though it looked different. Felinological associations recognized both types of cat as a single breed, meaning they were judged by the same standards during cat shows, until 1982 when FIFE registered the Scandinavian type of European Shorthair as a separate breed with its own standard. Life expectancy Life expectancy depends on whether the cat is outdoors or not. An outdoor cat has a life expectancy of 14 years on average. Temperament The breed has developed from the natural mouse hunters of Europe with the wish to strengthen the most desirable personality traits of the domestic cats. Most European Shorthairs are strong and active, and as a rule they are friendly towards people of all ages. They get on well with other cats and tolerate dogs well. European Shorthairs are intelligent and playful, and most of them are expert at keeping houses and gardens free of all types of rodents. They tend to handle changes and an active home very well, making them suitable for families with children. Physical characteristics A European male cat of three years In terms of appearance the European Shorthair is a very harmonious and supple cat, which should give the overall appearance of medium with no single feature being enlarged or reduced when compared to the original domestic shorthaired cats of Europe. The European Shorthair is a muscular, medium-sized to large cat, with a broad, well-muscled chest. The strong legs are average length and the paws are round. The tail is fairly thick at the base, tapering to a rounded tip. The head is rounded and should be longer than it is wide, making it not as round as the head of the British Shorthair. The ears are medium-sized; the width of the ear corresponds to the height of the ears, which has a slightly rounded tip. They are quite wide-set and upright. The eyes are rounded and may be of any colour. The European Shorthair's dense coat is short, glossy and springy; meaning it should and should lie down again after having been ruffled by a hand going against the hairs. The European Shorthair should only be shorthaired. All natural colours are permitted, such as black, red, blue and cream, with or without tabby, silver or white markings, though the combination of tabby with white and smoke with white is not allowed in FIFe. Pure white is also permitted. The eye colour corresponds to the coat colour and may be yellow, green or orange. Blue or odd-eyed individuals are permitted if the coat colour is white. Breed description * Head: Fairly broad with rounded contours but a bit longer than it is wide. Slightly rounded skull and forehead. Well-developed cheeks, especially in males. Straight, moderately long and broad nose with a gentle curve between the eyes. A stop is not allowed. Rounded, firm chin. * Ears: Medium in size, slightly rounded at the tips and may be tufted. The height of the ears corresponds to the width of the base. * Eyes: Large, round, widely separated, set at a slight slant. Colour must be clear and pure and correspond to that of the coat. * Neck: Moderately long and muscular. * Body: Fairly long, not stout. Stocky, strong, muscular. Broad, well-developed chest. * Members: Strong and sturdy, medium in length and narrowing steadily into firm, round paws. * Paw: Moderately long, strong, solid, tapering evenly to the paws, which are round and firm. * Tail: Moderately long, fairly thick at the base, tapering gradually to a rounded tip. * Coat: Short, dense, close-lying, lustrous hair. Recognised colours depends on organisation. None allow chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, fawn, amber, ticked tabby, or any of the pointed varieties. * Faults: Body too large or too stout or cobby. Strong resemblance to British Shorthair or American Shorthair. Pendulous cheeks. Hanging jowls. Clear stop. Long, woolly fur. Popularity The breed is mostly popular in Scandinavia, as there are still huge populations of similar-looking cats in Europe, and the European Shorthairs are for those appreciating a supple breed which has had a selection for a good temper.

Heinlein collated by his wife Virginia Heinlein from his notes and writings. Background The work is the closest that Heinlein, an ex-naval officer and prominent science fiction writer, came to writing an autobiography. The book contains a wide range of correspondence, notes and memoirs edited by Heinlein's wife Virginia, and was published a year and a half after his death. Contents Grumbles from the Grave provides insight into Heinlein's writing process (and the editorial/publishing process with which he was often at odds). In addition, it contains evidence of his philosophy as applied to his life and personal opinions. Beginning with a short biography of Robert by Virginia, the bulk of the book consists of excerpts of correspondence from the period from 1939 to 1970, from when he began writing science fiction until the onset of his first major illness. There is considerable information provided into how the 13-year gestation of Heinlein's novel Stranger in a Strange Land evolved. Additionally there is the original postlude to Podkayne of Mars and a discussion of cuts made to his novel, Red Planet. Criticisms Frederik Pohl has complained \\"Robert had talked about allowing posthumous publication of his real feelings about a lot of things that he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable to talk about while he was alive, and indicated that some of his private letters would be a source for the book. Then some posthumous book with that title did come out, and it was a great disappointment. Someone ‚Äî it could have been only [Virginia Heinlein] ‚Äî had washed his face and combed his hair and turned whatever it was that Robert might have wanted to say into the equivalent of thank-you notes for a respectable English tea. I know that Robert wrote some much more raunchy letters than any of those, because I myself got one or two. But all the raunch has been edited out. What‚Äôs left is actually rather boring and does a great disservice to the real Heinlein, whose physical person may have been embodied as a conventional hard-right conservative but whose writing was ‚Äî sometimes vulgarly ‚Äî that of a free-thinking iconoclast\\".

The non-modifiable FRS generally comes in the form of executable binaries and is often used by proprietary software companies and authors to showcase their work or to encourage the user to buy full products from them (in the case of shareware, demo or trial versions). Freeware that is not restricted to be obtained from a specific distributor is also FRS. Firmware and microcode In cases of firmware or microcode, it is acceptable for major open-source projects like OpenBSD to include a binary firmware of a device within the distribution, as long as said firmware runs only on the external device in question, and not on the main CPU where the operating system itself is running. However, for such an inclusion to be in place, the binary firmware must be distributed under an adequate licence, like ISC or BSD, and must not require a discriminatory contract to be in place. A lack of such licence is why wireless devices from Intel Corporation do not work out of the box in almost all open-source distributions, whereas Ralink wireless cards work just fine.

Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group is Shona. The Shona people have created many sculptures and carvings which are made with the finest materials available. Art Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewelry and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture in essence has been a fusion of African folklore with European influences. Also, a recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. Among members of the white minority community, theatre has a large following, with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe's urban areas. Though the country's art is admired by those that know of its existence, several Zimbabwean artists have managed to gain a world audience. To name some world-famous Zimbabwean sculptors, we have Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi, and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly African Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists, including New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States. Language Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, \\"Koisan\\" (presumably Tsoa), Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, \\"sign language\\" (Zimbabwean sign languages), Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda, and Xhosa. Much of the population speaks Bantu languages, such as Shona (chishona) (76%) and Ndebele (18%). Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, Feso by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1957. English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas. Education in Zimbabwe is taught in English, Shona and Ndebele. Many rural primary schools teach in the native language until grade three; then, school is taught in English.\\"Zimbabwe Education System\\". www.classbase.com. Retrieved 2015-10-19. Food Like in many African countries, a majority of Zimbabweans depend on staple foods. \\"Mealie meal\\", or cornmeal as it is known in other parts of the world, is used to prepare bota, a porridge made by mixing cornmeal with water, to make a thick paste. This is usually flavored with butter or peanut butter. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast. Cornmeal is also used to make sadza, which is usually eaten for dinner, and by many for lunch too. The process of making sadza is similar to bota, however after the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste until it is firm. This meal is usually served with vegetables (spinach, chou moellier, or spring greens/collard greens), beans, and meat (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with boerewors (a sausage made from beef or pork), chicken, or curdled milk (sour milk), commonly known as \\"lacto\\" (mukaka wakakora or \\"amasi\\"). Rice and chicken with coleslaw salad is often served as the main meal. Graduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat, sheep, or cow, which will be braaied (or barbecued) for the gathered family. Since Zimbabwe was a British colony, they have adopted some English habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, however they will still have 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, which can be leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.

It is made up of a morphologically diverse group of related suborders. The origin of the Phacopida order is uncertain. It comprises three suborders (Phacopina, Calymenina, and Cheirurina) which share a distinctive protaspis (developmental stage lacking segments) type. The Cheirurina and Calymenina retain a rostral plate (an apomorphy) but in virtually all Phacopina the free cheeks are yoked as a single piece. This sort of similarity in development suggests phylogenetic unity. The suborder Calymenina is the most primitive of the Phacopida order and shares some characteristics with the order Ptychopariida, though it is not included in the subclass Librostoma. Reconstruction of the phacopids Phacops and Walliserops Phacopida had 8 to 19 thoracic segments and are distinguishable by the expanded glabella, short or absent preglabellar area, and schizochroal (Phacopina) or holochroal (Cheirurina and Calymenina) eyes. Schizochroal eyes are compound eyes with up to around 700 separate lenses. Each lens has an individual cornea which extended into a rather large sclera. The development of schizochroal eyes in phacopid trilobites is an example of post-displacement paedomorphosis. The eyes of immature holochroal Cambrian trilobites were basically miniature schizochroal eyes. In Phacopida, these were retained, via delayed growth of these immature structures (post-displacement), into the adult form. Phacops rana and Dalmanites limulurus are two of the best-known members of this order. Other known phacopids include Cheirurus, Deiphon, Calymene, Flexicalymene and Ceraurinella.

An attached file with TNEF encoding is most often named winmail.dat or win.dat, and has a MIME type of Application/MS-TNEF. The official (IANA) media type, however, is application/vnd.ms-tnef.  Overview  Some TNEF files contain information used only by Outlook to generate a richly formatted view of the message, such as embedded (OLE) documents or Outlook-specific features such as forms, voting buttons, and meeting requests. Other TNEF files may contain files which have been attached to an e-mail message. Within the Outlook e-mail client, TNEF encoding cannot be explicitly enabled or disabled (except via a registry setting). Selecting RTF as the format for sending an e-mail implicitly enables TNEF encoding, using it instead of the more common and widely compatible MIME standard. When sending plain text or HTML format messages, some versions of Outlook (apparently including Outlook 2000) prefer MIME, but may still use TNEF under some circumstances (for example, if an Outlook feature requires it). TNEF attachments can contain security-sensitive information such as user login name and file paths, from which access controls could possibly be inferred.  Exchange Server  Native-mode Microsoft Exchange 2000 organizations will, in some circumstances, send entire messages as TNEF-encoded raw binary independent of what is advertised by the receiving SMTP server. As documented in Microsoft KBA #323483,Microsoft KBA #323483 this technique is not RFC-compliant because these messages have the following characteristics: * They may include non-ASCII characters outside the 0‚Äì127 US- ASCII range. * The lines in these messages are often too long for transport via SMTP. * They do not follow the CRLF.CRLF message termination semantics as specified in RFC 821. Internal communications between Exchange Servers (2000 and later) over SMTP encode the message in S/TNEF (Summary TNEF) format. The conversion between the format needed by the end client on the Internet is performed on the last Hub Transport server before final delivery, and when the Hub Transport role of an Exchange Server is about to deliver the message to a mailbox role server, the message is converted to MAPI format for storage. S/TNEF differs from TNEF in that it is 8-bit (not 7-bit for TNEF) and does not contain a plain-text portion.

The sound was named by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskj√∂ld for the expedition ship Antarctic which in 1902, under the command of Carl Anton Larsen, was the first vessel to navigate it. Since 2005 cruise ships have been visiting the area. Geography Ice shelf extending from Joinville Island into Antarctic Sound The Antarctic Sound is the stretch of water that separates Trinity Peninsula, the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, from the Joinville Island group which consists of D'Urville Island, Joinville Island, Dundee Island and the smaller Bransfield Island. The northern limit of the sound, where it joins the Bransfield Strait, is the line connecting Cape Dubouzet (63¬∞16'S, 57¬∞03'W) on Trinity Peninsula with Turnbull Point (63¬∞02'S, 56¬∞36'W) on D'Urville Island. The southern limit is the line connecting Cape Scrymgeour on Andersson Island (63¬∞35'S, 56¬∞26'W) with Cape Purvis on Dundee Island (63¬∞35'S, 55¬∞58'W). Close to the north of Andersson Island lies the smaller Jonassen Island, the two being separated by the Yalour Strait which joins the Antarctic Sound to the Erebus and Terror Gulf part of the Weddell Sea. The sound is long and from wide. The Tabarin Peninsula forms the southwestern coast of the Antarctic Sound and contains several bays, the main ones being Hope Bay and Trepassey Bay. History Antarctic, the first vessel to navigate the sound The Antarctic Sound was first navigated by the vessel Antarctic belonging to the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1902, captained by Otto Nordenskj√∂ld. Frequently clogged by pack ice, particularly tabular icebergs broken from the Larsen Ice Shelf, it is deceptive and difficult to traverse, and in the year after its first navigation, the same vessel was trapped and crushed by the ice, the ship's crew spending the winter at Hope Bay. Another vessel trying to navigate the sound en route for Snow Hill Island in 1920, failed to get through and could not even reach Hope Bay, and \\"Operation Tabarin\\" in 1944 was beset by similar problems. Hope Bay was at one time the site of a British base, and there is now a permanently manned Argentinian research station there called Esperanza Base. Fauna Hope Bay has been recognised as an Important Bird Area. Birds that breed here include the gentoo penguin, brown skua, Antarctic tern, Wilson's storm petrel, kelp gull and snowy sheathbill. It also houses one of the largest breeding colonies of Ad√©lie penguin in Antarctica. At Trepassey Bay, gentoo and Ad√©lie penguins also breed, as well as Cape petrels, snow petrels, skuas and kelp gulls. Weddell seals often haul out on the beach and leopard seals hunt offshore.

It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plant is a popular garden subject, with many cultivars available. It is the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).This biennial plant vegetates in the first year after sowing, before flowering and then dying in the second year. It often self-seeds to produce new plants. Description Digitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, long and broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year. The flowering stem develops in the second year, typically tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within. The fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2 mm seeds.

Genetics The four possible phenotypes for Digitalis purpurea The colours of the petals of the Digitalis purpurea are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other.Griffiths AJF, Miller JH, Suzuki DT, et al. An Introduction to Genetic Analysis. 7th edition. New York: W. H. Freeman; 2000. Gene interaction in petal color of foxgloves. The M gene determines the production of a purple pigment, a type of anthocyanin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhancer of the M gene, and leads it to produce a big amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene makes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower. This combination leads to four phenotypes: *M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots; *m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots; *M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower; *M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower. Cultivation  The plant is a popular ornamental, providing height and colour in late spring and early summer. Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side. Numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours. Seeds are frequently sold as a mixture (e.g. Excelsior hybrids, in shades of white, pink and purple). Some strains are easily grown by the novice gardener, while others are more challenging. They may also be purchased as potted plants in the spring. The following selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *Camelot Series: **'Camelot Cream' **'Camelot Lavender' **'Camelot Rose' **'Camelot White' *Dalmatian Series: **'Dalmatian Cr√®me' **'Dalmatian Peach' **'Dalmatian White' *D. √ó mertonensis (the strawberry foxglove) *D. purpurea f. alba *'Martina' *'Pam's Choice' *'The Shirley' (Gloxinioides group) Digitalis purpurea is hardy down to (USDA zones 4‚Äì9).Perennials.com: Digitalis purpurea ‚ÄòDalmatian Purple‚Äô  Toxicity  Due to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested. Extracted from the leaves, this same compound, whose clinical use was pioneered by William Withering, is used as a medication for heart failure. He recognized it \\"reduced dropsy\\", increased urine flow and had a powerful effect on the heart. Unlike the purified pharmacological forms, extracts of this plant did not frequently cause intoxication because they induced nausea and vomiting within minutes of ingestion, preventing the patient from consuming more. The main toxins in Digitalis spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, are known to have steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one. Symptoms of Digitalis poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death. Uses Digoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.

This clause contains the only explicit reference to religion in the original seven articles of the U.S. Constitution. The ban on religious tests contained in this clause protects not only federal officeholders and employees but also the officeholders of \\"State Legislatures, and [...] the several states\\". This clause is cited by advocates of separation of church and state as an example of the \\"original intent\\" of the Framers of the Constitution to avoid any entanglement between church and state, or involving the government in any way as a determiner of religious beliefs or practices. This is significant because this clause represents the words of the original Framers, even prior to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Text Background A variety of Test Acts were instituted in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. Their main purpose was to exclude anyone not a member of the Church of England‚Äîthe official state religion‚Äîfrom holding government office, notably Catholics and \\"nonconforming\\" Protestants. Government officials were required to swear oaths, such as the Oath of Supremacy, that the monarch of England was the head of the Church and that they possessed no other foreign loyalties, such as to the pope. Later acts required officials to disavow transubstantiation and the veneration of saints. Such laws were common throughout Europe, where numerous countries had a state religion. Many colonists of the Thirteen Colonies had left England in part in search of a place where they could practice their own religion. In many cases the colonial governments they set up established an official religion, requiring residents to adhere to the beliefs of the founding sect. With the royal government's religious favoritism fresh in their memory, the Founders sought to prevent the return of the Test Acts by adding this clause to the Constitution. Specifically, Charles Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina‚Äîwhere a Protestant denomination was the established state religion‚Äîintroduced the clause to Article VI, and it passed with little opposition.Drawn from original source: Drawn from original source: \\"The Individual Liberties within the Body of the Constitution: A Symposium: The No Religious Test Clause and the Constitution of Religious Liberty: A Machine That Has Gone of Itself.\\" Case Western Reserve Law Review 37: 674‚Äì747. Dreisbach, Daniel L. 1999. Forced oaths The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision broadly, saying that any required oath to serve anything other than the Constitution is invalid. In the case of Ex parte Garland, the Court overturned a loyalty oath that the government had tried to apply to pardoned Confederate officials. As the officials had already received full presidential pardons (negating an argument based on their potential status as criminals), the Court ruled that forcing officials and judges to swear loyalty oaths was unconstitutional. State law 400pxthumb Earlier in U.S. history, the doctrine of states' rights allowed individual states complete discretion regarding the inclusion of a religious test in their state constitutions. In 1961 such religious tests by the states were deemed to be unconstitutional by the extension of the First Amendment provisions to the states (via the incorporation of the 14th Amendment). In the 1961 case Torcaso v. Watkins, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that such language in state constitutions was in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Citing the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause in Everson v. Board of Education and linking it to Torcaso v. Watkins, Justice Hugo Black stated for the Court: > We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government > can constitutionally force a person \\"to profess a belief or disbelief in any > religion.\\" Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements > which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those > religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those > religions founded on different beliefs. The Supreme Court did not rule on the applicability of Article VI, stating that \\"Because we are reversing the judgment on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to consider appellant's contention that this provision applies to state as well as federal offices.\\" Eight states still do include language in their constitutions either requiring state officeholders to have particular religious beliefs or specifically protecting those who do. However, the requirements are unenforceable because of the 1961 Supreme Court decision. The states are: #Arkansas (Article 19 Section 1) #Maryland (Declaration of Rights, Article 37) #Mississippi (Article 14, Section 265) #North Carolina (Article 6 Section 8) #Pennsylvania (Article 1 Section 4) Specifically protects officeholders with religious belief but is silent on whether those without such beliefs are also protected. The required beliefs include belief in a Supreme Being, and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments. #South Carolina (Article 17 Section 4) #Tennessee (Article 9 Section 2) #Texas (Article 1 Section 4) Some of these same states also specify that the oath of office include the words \\"so help me God\\". In some cases, these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required also of jurors, witnesses in court, notaries public, and state employees. In the 1997 case of Silverman v. Campbell,486 SE.2d 1, 326 S.C. 208 (1997) the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution requiring an oath to God for employment in the public sector violated Article VI of the federal constitution, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore could not be enforced.486 SE.2d 1, 326 S.C. 208 (1997)  References  Category:Article Six of the United States Constitution Category:Clauses of the United States Constitution Category:Religion and politics Category:Freedom of religion in the United States Category:Christianity and law in the 18th century ","title":"No Religious Test Clause"},{"id":"1158277","text":"A crucifrice A crucifer or cross-bearer is, in some Christian churches (particularly the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, Lutherans, and United Methodist Church), a person appointed to carry the church's processional cross, a cross or crucifix with a long staff, during processions at the beginning and end of the service. The term \\"crucifer\\" comes from the Latin crux (cross) and ferre (to bear, carry). It thus literally means \\"cross- bearer\\". Use of the term \\"crucifer\\" is most common in Anglican churches. In the Catholic Church the usual term is \\"cross-bearer\\".Patrick Morrisroe, \\"Cross-Bearer\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1908) In the Latin Catholic Church the function of the crucifer/cross-bearer was generally carried out by a subdeacon until Pope Paul VI decreed in his motu proprio Ministeria quaedam of 15 August 1972 that \\"the major order of subdiaconate no longer exists in the Latin Church\\". In line with that document, the functions previously assigned to the subdeacon are now entrusted to the acolyte and the reader.Pope Paul VI, Ministeria quaedam A seventeenth-century Council of Milan stated that a crucifer should, when possible, be a cleric and that, if a lay person be selected, that \\"the most worthy of the laity should be selected for the office.\\" For more solemn processions, the cleric should be vested in amice, alb, and tunic. On less solemn occasions he may just be vested in surplice. During the procession the staff is held with both hands such that the cross is well above the head. The cross-bearer leads the procession except when there is a thurifer and is accompanied by two servers on the more solemn occasions.

It is an updated version of the German-Singaporean Armbrust design, and operates on the same principles. The development of this weapon began in 2000 and the MATADOR will eventually replace the German-Singaporean Armbrust Light Anti-tank Weapon, which has been in service since the 1980s. The MATADOR was developed jointly by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), in collaboration with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Dynamit Nobel Defence (DND) joint team. Capabilities The MATADOR is among the lightest in its class. The warhead is effective against both vehicle armour and brick walls. The weapon has little backblast, making it safe for operation in confined spaces. The MATADOR is supposed to be capable of defeating the armour of most known armoured personnel carriers and light tanks in the world. The dual-capability warhead, when acting in the delay mode, creates an opening greater than in diameter in a double brick wall, and acts as an anti-personnel weapon against those behind the wall, offering an unconventional means of entry when fighting in built-up areas. The MATADOR's projectile is claimed to be insensitive to wind due to its propulsion system, which results in a highly accurate weapon system. Warhead The warhead can be used in both High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) and High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) modes against armor and walls or other fortifications respectively. Selection is done by extending a \\"probe\\" (most likely a fuse extender) for HEAT mode and leaving the \\"probe\\" retracted for HESH mode. Countermass system Comparing the Armbrust (top) and MATADOR (bottom). Similar to the Armbrust, the countermass counteracts the recoil of the weapon upon firing. The countermass consists of shredded plastic, which is launched out of the rear of the weapon when it is fired. This plastic is rapidly slowed by air resistance, allowing the weapon to be fired safely within an enclosed space. In addition, the positioning of the countermass takes into consideration the centre of gravity of the weapon to ensure good balance for better accuracy. Variants IDF soldier with a MATADOR Further variants of MATADOR have also been developed by Rafael and Dynamit Nobel Defence, designed primarily for anti-structure use by soldiers operating in dense urban environments. ;MATADOR-MP :Multi-purpose weapon with a warhead effective against a wide variety of ground targets, from light armoured vehicles to fortified positions and urban walls. As with the initial MATADOR, this is achieved with a dual-mode fuse, which has been improved on the MATADOR-MP such that it now automatically discriminates between hard and soft targets rather than requiring the operator to manually make the selection. A dedicated targeting device, mounted on its Picatinny rail, incorporates a reflex sight and laser rangefinder to provide a high hit probability. ;MATADOR-WB :Specialised wall-breaching weapon, featuring an Explosively- Formed Ring (EFR) warhead that breaches a man-sized hole, between to across, in typical urban walls. ;MATADOR-AS :Anti-structure weapon with an advanced tandem warhead that can also be set between two modes. The anti-emplacement mode uses an enhanced blast effect to defeat structures and fortifications, while the penetrating/mouse-holing mode defeats light armoured vehicles and creates mouseholes in urban walls. MATADOR-AS has been ordered by the British Army, and is slated for service entry in 2009. Combat history The MATADOR saw its first combat deployment in January 2009, by Israel Defence Forces soldiers during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. MATADOR-AS was used to breach walls in structures, allowing IDF troops to pass through and attack opponents inside.

Part of its significance lies in its very title: parliament was now \\"seen as both institutionally well defined and a proper subject for description and conscious reflection\\".Maddicott 2010, p. 277 However, it also includes elements of fantasy, both in relation to the way it sets out the history of parliaments, and its aspirations for the roles of different groups in parliament.Maddicott 2010, p. 365 Provenance An ancient document which has exercised much debate over its antiquity and authorship, the Modus is no longer seen as a later forgery, despite the doubts of earlier antiquaries, such as John Selden (1584‚Äì1654) and William Prynne (1600‚Äì1669). Thomas Duffus Hardy (1804‚Äì78) was a prominent historian and archivist, whose final position was senior assistant keeper of the Public Record Office. He edited the most complete version of the volume in 1846, and believed it was probably written \\"some time between the years 1294 and 1327\\", at or shortly after Edward I's Model Parliament of 1295.Hardy 1846, p.xvii Writing in 1934, William A Morris reviewed the conflicting views on the date of the Modus that were first offered in the seventeenth century and concluded that it must have been written during the reign of Edward II (1307-27), probably 1321. M. V. Clarke says the book \\"was written in 1322 in order to expound and define the parliamentary theory and practice upheld by moderate men of that time\\".; quoted in Galbraith 1953, p. 84 That view on the date is also supported by W. C. Weber. References within the Modus suggest that the writer had experience of parliament, as well as an understanding of the royal administration. V. H. Galbraith believed that someone who had such experience was the Yorkshireman, William Ayermin (also Airmyn, or Ayreminne) (died 1336).Galbraith 1953, p.90 Ayermin held a number of offices in the church and royal administration, including being Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery from 1316‚Äì24 and almost certainly also clerk of the parliament. and Galbraith 1953 Significance The significance of the Modus lies in its descriptions of the procedures and organisation of Parliament and the growing importance of the Commons. Parliament had developed by the early 14th century to the point where it could promote the transmission of the crown's policies and intentions in a positive manner outwards from the centre, and representation was the best method of doing this; notably, the Commons were more representative than magnates or prelates, who only represented themselves.Maddicott 2010, p. 293 Increasingly, the agreement of the Commons was necessary for the levy of all taxes: peers could give such consent personally, whereas the Commons were proxies for the bulk of the population. During the reign of Richard II, prominent members of the House of Lancaster wished to play up the importance of the Commons, compared to that of the Lords, prelates and magnates, and to legitimate processes in the Commons to depose a king who had lost the support of the people. The Modus was helpful to them in its emphasis on the representative power of the Commons: \\"We must understand that two Knights which come to the Parliament for the Shires and County out of which they come have a greater voice in Parliament to grant, than the greatest Earl in England\\". in Early English Books Online Maddicott offers a concise summary of the document's significance: \\"About the precise functions and powers of the commons the author of the Modus was, so far as we can see, often wrong. But about their general weight and position he was not so far out ... It is not hard to envisage the sort of body which it had in mind playing its part in the deposition of a king\\".Maddicott 2010, p. 366 In a major political crisis in Ireland in 1418‚Äì19, the veteran statesman Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston, was accused of treason, largely on account of his ownership of a copy of the document. He was quickly released and restored to favour, apparently after explaining that he had simply found it among his father's papers and thought it worth keeping. This copy was itself copied onto the patent roll of the Irish Chancery.

She was born in Lodz, Poland to Tobiasz (Tuvyeh) Winter and Majta Laja (Leah) Winter-Kohn. Winter is perhaps best known for her authorship of Trains: A Memoir of a Hidden Childhood during and after World War II, which explores not only her survival of the Holocaust as a 'hidden child' but also the psychological toll of keeping her identity hidden, even to herself, in post-World War II Poland. She studied theater at the Leon Schiller Advanced State School for Theatre in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ before its division into separate theater and film schools. She has directed productions of Antigone, Ondine, and Peer Gynt. Her parents, maternal grandparents Szymon and Shajna Kohn, younger brother J√≥zio (Josef), and other members of her extended family were murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp. She has two children (both boys), Daniel and David. Miriam could be found at various signings. One was at the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. on 8 June 2012. She died of cancer. Life during World War II World War II began when Miriam was six and living in Lodz, Poland. Her family was expelled from Lodz by the Nazis and confined first in the Warsaw Ghetto and then in the Ozarow Ghetto, but Miriam's parents were able to sneak her out. She was first taken into custody by a family friend, Czesia. That was until on the train from O≈ºar√≥w, Czesia found Maryla Dudek, a Catholic Pole, who assumed custody of Miriam but wasn't aware that Miriam was Jewish at the time. In Lw√≥w (Lemberg), Miriam lived in hiding with Maryla until she was detected as Jewish by the other children. This caused them to have to move to Czudek and then to Wola Rzedzi≈Ñska, which is where Miriam lived with a Catholic family. There she was raised Catholic and wanted to be baptized and receive communion, but her priest had apparently suspected her true background and wouldn't baptize her. Instead, her priest devised a scam procedure to make it seem like she met the requirements to not expose her. Despite this, she was still exposed by some of the village people and had to flee to Hucisko, a village where Maryla's sister, Zosia Rumak, lived. After that, she was placed with a couple in the nearby village of Styk√≥w but when it was revealed in church that she hadn't been baptized, she expected repercussions and fled back to Hucisko and lived with Zosia. Later she was moved from Hucisko to Ranizow, and it was there that the area was liberated by the Russian Army in the summer of 1944.  Life after World War II  After liberation, Miriam lived in Lw√≥w with Maryla, at which point her last name was changed to Dudek, and her birth date from June 1933 to September 1937. This made it easier for Miriam to pass as Maryla‚Äôs daughter. When the war was completely over, Miriam lived with Maryla and her husband Rysiu, working in Rysiu‚Äôs bakery and selling his products. She was also able to attend school once again. However, she fled at the age of 15 after months of being mistreated physically and emotionally, and began living in an orphanage in Szczecin. Miriam enrolled in school once again, graduating high school in 1951. In 1963, she married Romek Or≈Çowski and gave birth to their first child, Daniel, in 1964. Miriam and her husband applied for emigration and, in 1969, were able to move to the United States, where they had their second Child, David.

Developed by the Regional Transportation District (RTD), the plan consists of new commuter rail, light rail, and express bus services. Six new light rail, electric commuter rail and diesel commuter rail lines with a combined length of will be constructed under the plan. It expands on previous transportation projects, notably T-REX, and includes 57 new transit stations and stops, 21,000 new parking spaces, of a bus service between Denver and Boulder and the renovation of Denver Union Station as a multi-modal transportation hub. Originally envisioned to cost $4.7 billion and to be completed in 2017, voters in the eight counties that comprise the RTD approved a 0.4 percent sales tax increase in 2004. The 2008 global financial crisis caused a drop in revenues and material costs rose faster than forecast. By 2010, the budget grew to $6.5 billion while projected revenues dropped to $4.1 billion. Another tax increase was not put on the 2010 or 2012 ballot, although the project is not expected to be finished until at least 2044. Alternative funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, have been sought to complete projects as quickly as possible. The first of the six new lines envisioned in the plan, the West Corridor light rail line to Golden, Colorado, opened for revenue service on April 26, 2013. By mid-2014, construction was underway on the five other rail lines. Two commuter rail lines opened on their long-anticipated dates in 2016: the East Rail Line to Denver International Airport and the portion of the Northwest Rail Line to south Westminster. The I-225 Rail Line through Aurora opened on February 24, 2017 and the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge opened on April 26, 2019. In addition, the North Metro Rail Line to Thornton is expected to open in 2020. Denver Union Station underwent $200 million worth of facility improvements to turn it into the hub for new commuter and light rail lines as well as bus service in downtown Denver. The underground 22-bay bus concourse at Union Station opened on May 11, 2014, while the restaurants, bars, and hotel officially opened July 26, 2014. The renovation has spurred development and economic expansion in the surrounding area with developers adding 3,500 residential units and 1.5 million square feet of office space to the immediate neighborhood. FasTracks is estimated to have injected $3 billion into the local economy from 2005 to 2013 and is responsible for creating 12,000 direct full-time jobs since 2005. Progress FasTracks is being funded with federal appropriations, private contributions, and a region-wide sales tax increase. The project was allowed to begin when the sales tax portion of its funding was approved by Denver metro area voters in November 2004. The tax went into effect in January 2005. In 2006, engineering design of the initial segment, the West Rail Line, was begun. By spring of 2006, the environmental impact statements of all other proposed lines were underway. The municipal governments of Denver, Boulder, and Lakewood had launched detailed studies of community redevelopment possibilities around station locations. The cities of Westminster, Thornton, Aurora, Greenwood Village, Englewood, Sheridan, and Arvada are also planning transit oriented development areas around some of their proposed rail stations. Central to the regional nature of the service package is Union Station. Special studies of its redevelopment and adaptation for multiple transport modes were conducted and engineering design work and property development work was underway in 2006. In May 2007, a $1.5 billion budget overrun was reported. Despite service and construction reductions, by January 2010 the budget had grown to $6.5 billion (a $1.8 billion overrun). At the same time, sales tax revenue forecasts for 2017 were projected to come in much less than originally anticipated leaving the project $2.45 billion short. On April 13, 2010, the RTD board of directors decided to postpone asking voters to further increase the current sales tax. If the tax increase fails to be implemented, the full build-out of the FasTracks plan may not take place until 2042. On August 31, 2011, US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the US Department of Transportation had approved a $1 billion grant to the Eagle P3 project, which consists of the East and Gold commuter rail lines, covering half of the $2 billion cost of the construction of the two lines. In March 2012, RTD received an unsolicited proposal to build the I-225 Corridor line from Kiewit Infrastructure Co. After determining the proposal had merit and seeking other bids, RTD selected Kiewit to build the line. In 2013, RTD received a second unsolicited proposal this time to build the North Metro Line. RTD sought bids to build the line out in multiple phases. After receiving four bids, RTD selected the partnership of Graham Contracting Ltd., Balfour Beatty Rail Inc. and Harmon Contractors Inc. (GBBH), the same group that had submitted the unsolicited proposal. On April 26, 2013, the first completed segment of the FasTracks regional transit-expansion plan was opened to the public, the W Line. In November 2014, the first commuter rail cars arrived in Denver from the Hyundai‚ÄìRotem USA plant in Philadelphia, PA. Project details { style=\\"margin:auto;\\"  } =Eagle public-private partnership= The Eagle public‚Äìprivate partnership (P3) combines two commuter rail lines, the East Line to DIA and the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge, plus a section of the Northwest Line up to Westminster, and a maintenance facility into a single contract. Denver Transit Partners, the consortium of companies RTD selected to lead the Eagle P3 project, is responsible for the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the rail lines in the contract. Construction broke ground on the Gold Line on August 26, 2010. In August 2011, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood committed $1 billion in federal money to the Eagle P3 project. In December LaHood approved a $280 million loan to advance construction. As of June 2013, the project is on track to open the rail lines under contract in 2016. East Rail Line (commuter rail) Being constructed as part of the Eagle P3, the East Rail Line is a commuter rail line between downtown Denver, Aurora, and Denver International Airport using electric multiple unit (EMU) commuter trains. To expedite travel time between downtown Denver and Denver International Airport, only six stations will be located on the line. Construction started in August 2010, and the line opened to the public on April 22, 2016. Gold Line (commuter rail) The second full line funded under the Eagle P3, the Gold Line is an commuter rail corridor that will run from Denver Union Station to Wheat Ridge, passing through Adams County and Arvada. As with the East Corridor, the RTD Board of Directors chose EMU commuter trains to run on the Gold Line. Seven new stations‚Äîwith an already existing station at Union‚Äî were built for the line. It opened on April 26, 2019. =I-225 Corridor (light rail)= The I-225 Corridor is light rail line running through Aurora and facilitate a circumferential link between the Southeast Corridor and the East Line. The project will include seven new stations and provide 1,800 new parking spaces. Construction began in the spring of 2012 on a short section of the line as part of a joint contract with CDOT. Following an unsolicited proposal from Kiewit Infrastructure Co. funding was secured for the full line which opened on February 24, 2017. =North Metro Corridor (commuter rail)= The North Metro Corridor is a commuter rail line that runs along an existing railroad right-of-way from Denver to 160th Avenue in Thornton. The line has eight stations on its route. In 2009, RTD paid $117 million to purchase the right- of-way from Union Pacific in preparation for the buildout of the North Metro line. However, with the global recession of 2009, the North Metro Corridor became a victim of financial setbacks and it was feared that the line would not be built until 2044. RTD was able to avoid delaying the construction of the line when it accepted an unsolicited offer in 2013 to build out the full line in two stages. The first phase was completed in 2020. =Northwest Rail Corridor (commuter rail)= The Northwest Rail Corridor is a commuter rail project between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont. The completion of the proposed line, would consist of seven stations. The route would follow an existing railroad right-of-way from BNSF. The only segment of the line that has been completed to date has been up to Westminster Station. The station sits just south west of Federal and 72nd in Westminster. The line runs from Denver's Union Station to south Westminster, with plans for future segments in the distant future. The project was and still is a construction project part of the Eagle P3 project. Future segments are in an unknown phase at the moment and no construction has started on any other segments on the line. The remaining segments are currently predicted for completion by the year 2044. The announcement angered many voters in the cities and suburbs north of Denver who had approved a sales tax increase in 2004 to fund the FasTracks project. The downturn in the economy and significant cost increases and delays associated with building and operating the Northwest Corridor led to the initiation of the year-long \\"Northwest Area Mobility Study\\". This was an effort between northwest area governments and transportation partners that set out to recommend alternatives to the voter approved commuter rail line that could have possibly brought near-term mobility improvements to the northwest area. The study concluded in 2014 and made a number of recommendations that were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors in June 2014. One of the recommendations adopted was an interim express bus service called \\"Flatiron Flyer\\". In summer 2018, the U.S. 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition was gathering support from other members to ask RTD to provide an estimate for at least weekday rush hour commuter rail service along the original corridor to Longmont. =West Corridor (light rail)= Preliminary work on the West Corridor light rail line began on May 16, 2007. During early stages of development, it was decided that the line from the Federal Center to the Jefferson County Government Center would be reduced to a single track to help cut costs. According to RTD, this change would reduce train headways from 15 minutes to 5 and make it easier for the line to run along the side of U.S. 6. Upon the completion of construction the line was designated the \\"W Line\\". The 12.1 mile light rail line was opened to the public on April 26, 2013 and is the first completed segment of the FasTracks regional transit-expansion plan. =US 36 Corridor= This is an long express bus line, branded \\"Flatiron Flyer\\", running along US 36 between Denver and Boulder, Colorado with six stops planned along the route. A joint project between CDOT and RTD, the road was widened by 40 feet in each direction to allow the addition of a high- occupancy vehicle lane instead of the trains voters approved. The project was completed in two phases, with the first phase completed in May 2010. The second phase began construction on July 2012 and opened to the public in 2016. Sections of the road subsequently collapsed in summer 2019. =Extensions (light rail)= There are plans for extensions to a few existing light rail lines; they include a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) extension to the Southwest Corridor, extending the line to the southwest corner of Lucent Boulevard and C-470. A 2.3-mile (3.7 km) extension to the Southeast Corridor into Lone Tree which opened to the public in May 2019; and a 0.8-mile (1.3 km) extension to the Central Corridor to connect the 30th & Downing station with the East Corridor commuter rail line at the intersection of 38th and Blake. Economic growth/development According to RTD (2012),Regional Transportation District of Denver. (2012). 2010 FasTracks Quality of Life Detailed Report. 1-86. when new development occurs near stations, it increases the likelihood that residents and workers will choose transit as their transportation mode. This reduces the growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and auto trips on a constrained roadway system while, at the same time, accommodating new growth. RTD has conducted a Quality of Life (QoL) study for the neighborhoods‚Äô impacted by FasTracks with baseline data collection starting in 2006 and continuing bi-annually to the present. The QoL study tracks a number of economic and community development indicators. Rolling stock RTD Silverliner at Denver Union Station. As of 2015, FasTracks has on order 66 Hyundai Rotem Silverliner V electric multiple unit rail cars operated in a married pair configuration. These cars were initially developed by Rotem for Philadelphia's SEPTA Regional Rail in 2009, with RTD's order coming a year later in 2010. RTD's numbered 4001 through 4066, possess a number of differences from the ones operated by SEPTA, most notably the lack of low platform steps and full-width cabs. All trains operating on the commuter rail lines will be equipped with positive train control. Criticism = Denver Union Station Design = The Regional Transportation District (RTD) and Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) has received significant criticism for the redevelopment of the Denver Union Station. Many public transportation advocates and planning experts maintain that the project precludes impending access of high-speed rail technology and north-south passenger rail routes such as Front Range Rail, is designed to present logistical complications for both rail and bus commuters, lacks integration of bicycle facilities and an intercity bus station, and is being modeled to perform as a stub-end terminal for current and future intercity rail routes. Many citizens and public transportation advocates have also expressed frustration with the high cost associated with the project's design and its direct impact on the agency's ability to complete all rail lines that were a part of the original voter- approved FasTracks project proposal. In 2009 the Colorado Rail Passenger Association, a local rail transportation advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against the Federal Transportation Administration for its acceptance of DUSPA's Environmental Impact Statement, which suspiciously omitted several impactful statements and comments that were contributed by the members of the community. =Eminent domain= The Regional Transportation District have used eminent domain to condemn properties in the path of transportation projects. Several property owners have protested the taking of their properties for FasTracks lines. = Federal Station relocation = The Regional Transportation District proposed relocating the Gold Line Federal Station from the previously-approved east side site to the west side of Federal Boulevard. Some residents opposed the move on the grounds that was only to benefit a developer who owned property near the west side site, and revitalization of the community would be better served by the east side location. RTD supported the move because the east side location was a former waste dump, and that the west side location would be more accessible for the community. On December 15, 2010, RTD announced that the Federal Station would remain on the east side of Federal and not be moved to the west side. The Adams County Commissioners, who had originally requested the change, withdrew their support under pressure from residents of a subdivision near the west site, who opposed the private developer's plan to build higher-density housing and commercial buildings around the new station site. = Quarter-century Northwest Rail Line delay = Originally, the voter-approved plan called for a high-capacity commuter rail line running from Denver Union Station to Longmont, passing through North Denver, Adams County, Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville and Boulder. Back in early 2008, the diesel-powered heavy rail service was expected to start running in late 2014 or early 2015 - roughly ten years after the FasTracks vote - initially with 58 trains a day, ramping up over a decade to 84 trains by 2025.http://www.timescall.com/ci_13136675 The completion of this original plan has been delayed until 2044 due to lower tax revenues and higher costs than expected. As an interim measure, RTD introduced a new express bus system, branded \\"Flatiron Flyer\\", traveling in high-occupancy toll lanes along US 36 between Denver and Boulder. The consolidation of current express service between Denver and Boulder into this one system attracted criticism from Boulder residents, since increased frequencies would be balanced with some service cuts. Additionally, the ITDP classified the system as \\"not bus rapid transit\\", due to the use of lanes shared with private cars along US 36, the lack of street level boarding/alighting and the lack of an off-board fare system. A plan to allow Flatiron Flyer US 36 buses on shoulders during high- traffic periods required the 2016 state legislature to pass such authorization (passed Jan. 13, signed by governor Mar. 9), effective May 1.https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2016/04/rtds-denver- boulder-buses-will-use-shoulders-to.htmlhttp://www.dailycamera.com/boulder- county-news/ci_29830002/flatiron-flyer-buses-okd-drive-u-s-36 See also * Regional Transportation District References External links * *The Transit Alliance - A non-profit coalition promoting expanded rail and bus transit in the Denver Metro region.

It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software. The game was first released on the Atari ST, and was later for the Commodore 64, Macintosh, Amiga, Apple IIGS, PC, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Thomson TO8 and MO6 . The ST version is the only version that includes the full set of alien language sounds. The title tune is a stripped down version of \\"Ethnicolor\\" by Jean-Michel Jarre. Development Captain Blood was developed jointly by Didier Bouchon and Philippe Ulrich, both contributing design and scenario, and Bouchon graphics and programming for the Atari ST version. Bouchon originally designed covers for ERE informatique's Gazoline Software label, but he learned to program an assembler for the Atari ST after Ulrich provided him with one. Bouchon then created fractal-generated realtime graphics that inspired both to do a sci-fi inspired video game.Daniel Ichbiah, La saga des jeux vid√©o. Chapter 5. Vuibert. 2004. After ERE's absorption by Infogrames in summer of 1987 (partly justified by preliminary versions of Captain Blood), Ulrich and Bouchon isolated themselves in the Landes in order to have the game ready for Christmas. Many adaptations for both 16-bit and 8-bit machines were developed in successive months, although they were straight ports of the original Atari ST version in graphics, sound effects or music. Story The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who had picked \\"Captain Blood\\" as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood has successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connection with the human species. Gameplay The objective of the game is to track down and disintegrate five clones (referred to as Duplicates or Numbers depending on the version of the game) of Captain Blood. To find them, the player must speak to various aliens and gain their trust. Communication with aliens occurs via an icon-based interface known as UPCOM. This consists of around 150 icons, each representing a different concept. As each alien race discovered speaks its own language and reacts differently, the player must learn to negotiate using these UPCOM concepts in a style that suits the races. Other unique facets of the gameplay of Captain Blood included changes in the player interface as the game progressed; as time wore on, the character's health deteriorated. This was represented in-game via an increasing amount of shaking of the mouse cursor, making the game more and more difficult to control. Disintegrating a clone would temporarily relieve the symptoms. The player starts the game at the bridge of a biological ship, the Ark. The ship begins in the vicinity of one of four predetermined planets, each inhabited by a single alien. To make contact with an alien, the player launches an OORXX - a biological probe - to the planet's surface. The player must successfully navigate the probe over a fractal landscape, eventually reaching the alien at the end of a valley. The UPCOM interface then appears so that the player may talk to the alien and find out more information‚Äîmost importantly, the coordinates of other inhabited planets. The Ark also has the capability to hyperspace to other planets, scan planets for defences, destroy planets and teleport aliens to an area known as the Fridgitorium, for disintegration or transportation to another planet. An alien can only be teleported to the Ark after it has consented to do so. Reception Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review for its unusual concept, execution, and graphics. Orson Scott Card praised Captain Bloods EGA graphics and science-fiction story, but wrote in Compute! that \\"as a game, this one sucks pond scum\\", citing a poor interface and obscure game play. Info magazine‚ÄîJanuary/February 1989‚Äîgave the game 5 out of 5 stars, remarking: \\"Captain Blood is a marvelously alien experience. The graphics & sound are first rate. The more we played, the more we wanted to continue playing, if only to meet more aliens. There is a fully realized universe here that's easy to become completely immersed in.\\" Captain Blood sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. Legacy Captain Blood was followed by the sequel Commander Blood in 1994 and later by Big Bug Bang in 1997, a French-only release.

In between hands, a player is free to re-buy or add- on so long as their entire stack after the re-buy or add-on does not exceed the maximum buy-in. This rule generally applies to cash or ring games of poker rather than tournament games and is intended to level the stakes by creating a maximum and minimum buy-in as well as rules for adding and removing chips from play when playing with cash. A player also may not take a portion of their money off the table, unless they leave the game and take their entire stack out of play. Table stakes is the rule in most cash poker games because it allows players with vastly different bankrolls a reasonable amount of protection when playing with one another. Contrary to classic Hollywood poker movie scenes, money taken from the wallet during a hand does not play under table stakes. \\"Table stake\\" is related, and is the minimum amount of money a player must put on the table, and thus be able to bet under the table stakes rule, to play a hand. Other uses In business, table stakes are the minimum entry requirement for a market or business arrangement. They can be price, cost model, technology, or other capability that represents a minimum requirement to have a credible competitive starting position in a market or other business arrangement. For example, to be a wireless service provider, the table stakes are the basic features you need to have in order to be in that business to achieve foundation capability‚Äînetwork, handsets, a data service, a mail server, etc. Beyond that, real competitive advantage comes from additional nimbleness and cost or product differentiation.

The lake forms a horseshoe shape at the base of Knockadoon Hill and some rugged elevated countryside. It is one of Ireland's most important archaeological sites. Humans have lived near Lough Gur since about 3000 BC and there are numerous megalithic remains there. Grange stone circle (the largest stone circle in Ireland) and a dolmen are located near the lake. The remains of at least three crannogs are present, and remains of Stone Age houses have been unearthed (the house outlines are known as \\"The Spectacles\\"). A number of ring forts are found in the area, with one hill fort overlooking the lake. Some are Irish national monuments. It is here that the 14th-century lord of Munster and poet Gear√≥id Iarla, votary of the Goddess √Åine, is said to sleep in a cave and emerge at time of Ireland's need to gallop around the lake on his great silver-shod white horse. A visitors' centre is open beside Lough Gur, along with a car park and picnic area. A gradual shore-line is present at the visitor area, with a shallow section of lake reaching up to the maintained lawn. As a result, the area is often used for water sports, though motorised craft are banned on the lake. There is a castle, or tower house (closed to visitors) near the entrance to the carpark. Named Bourchier's Castle after Sir George Bourchier, the son of the second Earl of Bath, it lies at the neck of the peninsula around which the lake washes. There is some other architecture dating from more recent times, with the ruins of an early Christian church by the road leading down to the lake. At the far end of the lake are the ruins of a Norman castle, Black Castle, which is reached by a hill-side walk along the east side of the lake. This is one of the keeps used during the Desmond Rebellions, and is probably the place where the Earl of Desmond secured his authority in 1573 after casting off his English apparel and donning Irish garments on his return to Munster from London. The north end of Lough Gur reaches up to a maintained lawn at the visitor area at the lake.

Having returned home to Rathleigh House near Macroom, Cork, Ireland, the hot-tempered Art became involved in a feud with a protestant landowner and magistrate, Abraham Morris of Hanover Hall, Macroom. When Morris was High Sheriff of County Cork in 1771, he laid charges against Art following Art's alleged attack on Morris and the wounding of his servant on 13 July 1771 at Hanover Hall. In that October, Art was indicted his absence, and Morris offered a 20 guinea reward for his capture.Brennan, 2000 The feud between the two men continued and in 1773, Morris demanded that Art sell him the fine horse that √ì Laoghaire had brought back from his service in the Austro-Hungarian army for ¬£5. The Penal Laws stated that no Catholic might own a horse worth more than ¬£5 and could be forced to sell a more valuable one on demand to any Protestant at this price. Art refused to sell and challenged Morris to a duel, which Morris declined. Morris used, or misused, his position as magistrate to persuade his fellow magistrates to proclaim Art an outlaw, who could then legally be shot on sight. Morris led a contingent of soldiers that tracked √ì Laoghaire down to Carrignanimma on 4 May 1773, and he gave the order to fire on Art. The first shot, which killed Art, was fired by a soldier called Green. Morris and the soldiers were held to be guilty of Art's murder by a coroner's inquest on 17 May, but Morris was acquitted of the murder by Cork magistrates on 6 September 1773. (Under the Penal Laws, no Catholic could be a magistrate, or a lawyer.)https://archive.org/details/a608289300sculuoft Morris was shot in Cork on 7 July by Art's brother Cornelius, who saw Morris at a window of a house in Hammond's Lane where he was lodging and fired three shots, wounding Morris.

He is best known as the ambassador to Japan between 1932-1941, and as a high official in the State Department in Washington between 1944-1945, where he opposed hardliners, sought to avoid war, and sought a soft Japanese surrender in 1945 that enabled a peaceful American occupation of Japan after the war. After numerous minor diplomatic appointments, Grew was the Ambassador to Denmark (1920‚Äì1921) and Ambassador to Switzerland (1921‚Äì1924). In 1924, Grew became the Under Secretary of State, and in this position he oversaw the establishment of the U.S. Foreign Service. Grew was the Ambassador to Turkey (1927‚Äì1932) and the Ambassador to Japan 1932-1941, where he opposed American hardliners and recommended negotiation with Tokyo to avoid war. He was the ambassador in Tokyo at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 8, 1941) as well and was interned until American and Japanese diplomats were formally exchanged in 1942. On return to Washington he became the number two official in the State Department as Under Secretary, and sometimes served as acting Secretary of State. He promoted a soft peace with Japan that would allow the Emperor to maintain his status, which did become policy and which facilitated the Emperor's decision to surrender in 1945. Early life Grew was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in May 1880 to a wealthy Yankee family. He was groomed for public service. At the age of 12 he was sent to Groton School, an elite preparatory school whose purpose was to \\"cultivate manly Christian character\\". Grew was two grades ahead of Franklin D. Roosevelt. During his youth, Grew enjoyed the outdoors, sailing, camping, and hunting during his summers away from school. Grew attended Harvard College, graduating in 1902.Heinrichs, Waldo. American Ambassador: Joseph C. Grew and the Development of the American Diplomatic Tradition, Oxford University Press, 1986. . Career Following graduation, Grew made a tour of the Far East, and nearly died after being stricken with malaria. While recovering in India, he became friends with an American consul there. This inspired him to abandon his plan of following in his father's career as a banker, and he decided to go into diplomatic service. In 1904 he was a clerk at the consulate in Cairo, Egypt, and then rotated through diplomatic missions in Mexico City (1906), St. Petersburg (1907), Berlin (1908), Vienna (1911), and again in Berlin (1912-1917). He became acting chief of the State Department's Division of Western European Affairs during the war (1917-1919), and was the secretary of the American peace commission in Paris (1919-1920).Current Biography Yearbook, 1941, pp 345‚Äì46.Edward M. Bennett, \\"Grew, Joseph Clark (1880-1965)\\" American National Biography (1999) =Ambassador to Denmark and Switzerland = From April 7, 1920, until October 14, 1921, Grew served as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark appointed by President Woodrow Wilson. He was preceded by Norman Hapgood and succeeded by John Dyneley Prince. He replaced Hampson Gary as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland, appointed by President Warren Harding. In 1922, he and Richard Child acted as the American observers at the Conference of Lausanne.Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919 (2002), p. 452 Grew served as Ambassador until March 22, 1924, when Hugh S. Gibson replaced him. =Under Secretary of State (1924‚Äì1927)= From April 16, 1924, until June 30, 1927, Grew served as the Under Secretary of State in Washington under President Calvin Coolidge, taking over from William Phillips. =Ambassador to Turkey= In 1927, Grew was appointed as the American ambassador to Turkey. He served in Ankara for five years from 1927 until 1932. at which point he was offered the opportunity to return to the Far East. =Ambassador to Japan= In 1932, Grew was appointed by President Herbert Hoover to succeed William Cameron Forbes as the Ambassador to Japan, where he took up his posting on June 6. Ambassador and Mrs. Grew had been happy in Turkey, and were hesitant about the move, but decided that Grew would have a unique opportunity to make the difference between peace and war between the United States and Japan. The Grews soon became popular in Japanese society, joining clubs and societies there, and adapting to the culture, even as relations between the two countries deteriorated. One major episode came on 12 December 1937: the USS Panay incident, where the Japanese military bombed and sank the American gunboat Panay while it was anchored in the Yangtze River outside Nanking in China. Three American sailors were killed. Japan and the United States were at peace. The Japanese claimed that they did not see the American flags painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized, and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack outraged Americans and caused U.S. opinion to turn against the Japanese.Douglas Peifer, Choosing War: Presidential Decisions in the Maine, Lusitania, and Panay Incidents (Oxford UP, 2016) online review One of Grew's closest and most influential Japanese friends and allies was Prince Iyesato Tokugawa (1863-1940 - aka Prince Tokugawa Iesato) who was the president of Japan's upper house, the House of Peers. During most of the 1930s, these two men worked together in various creative diplomatic ways to promote goodwill between their nations. The 1937 photo illustration to the right reveals them having tea together, after attending a goodwill event commemorating the Japanese gifting of Cherry Blossom Trees to the U.S. in 1912. On the 25th Anniversary of that Japanese gift, the Garden Club of America now reciprocated by gifting flowering trees to Japan. The biography The Art of Peace by Stan S. Katz highlights the friendship and alliance between these two men. 1937 Tokyo, Ambassador Joseph Grew and Prince Iyesato Tokugawa promote and honor continued goodwill between their nations, the United States and Japan. Historian Jonathan Utley argues before Pearl Harbor Grew took the position that Japan had legitimate economic and security interests in greater East Asia, and he hoped that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull would accommodate these through high-level negotiations. However Roosevelt, Hull, and other top American officials were strongly opposed to Japanese massive intervention in China, and were negotiating agreements to send American warplanes to China, and negotiating with Great Britain and the Netherlands to cut off sales of steel and oil that Japan needed for aggressive warfare. Other historians argue that Grew was putting far too much trust in the power of his moderate friends in the Japanese government.Jonathan G. Utley, Going to War With Japan, 1937-1941 (2005).Stephen Pelz, 1985, p. 610. On January 27, 1941, Grew secretly cabled the State Department with rumors passed on by Peru's Minister to Japan, that \\"Japan military forces planned a surprise mass attack at Pearl Harbor in case of 'trouble' with the United States.\\" Grew's own published account of 1944 said, \\"There is a lot of talk around town [Tokyo] to the effect that the Japanese in case of a break with the United States, are planning to go all out in a surprise mass attack on Pearl Harbor.\\". Grew's report was provided to Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, and Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, but it was discounted by everyone involved in Washington and Hawaii. Grew served as ambassador until December 8, 1941, when the United States and Japan severed diplomatic relations during the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. All Allied diplomats were interned. On April 18, 1942, American B-25 bombers flying from a U.S. carrier made the Doolittle Raid, bombing Tokyo and other cities. Grew witnessed the attack while interned. When he realised the low-flying planes over Tokyo were American (not Japanese planes on maneuvers) he thought they may have flown from the Aleutian Islands, as they appeared too large to be from a carrier. Embassy staff were \\"very happy and proud\\". In accordance with diplomatic treaties, the United States and Japan negotiated the repatriation of their diplomats via neutral territory. In July 1942, Grew and 1,450 other American and foreign citizens went via steamship from Tokyo to Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese East Africa (now Maputo, Mozambique) aboard the Japanese liner Asama Maru and her backup, the Italian liner Conte Verde. In exchange the U.S. sent home the Japanese diplomats along with 1,096 other Japanese citizens.\\"Yank Free from Japan Reports 600 Tokyo Raid Deaths, Army Suicides,\\" The Fresno Bee, July 24, 1942, p. 2. The atomic bomb dilemma Grew wrote in 1942 that while he expected Nazi Germany to collapse as the Kaiser's German Empire had in 1918, he did not expect the Japanese Empire to do so: Grew became a member of a committee, along with the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, and the Secretary of the Navy, James Forrestal, that sought to work out an alternative to the use of the atomic bomb as a weapon, in order to bring about Japan's surrender. Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy drafted a proposed surrender demand for the Committee of Three, which was incorporated into Article 12 of the Potsdam Declaration. The original language of the Proclamation would have increased the chances for Japanese surrender as it allowed the Japanese government to maintain its emperor as a \\"constitutional monarchy\\". President Harry S. Truman, who was influenced by Secretary of State James Byrnes during the trip via warship to Europe for the Potsdam Conference, changed the language of the surrender demand. Grew knew how important the emperor was to the Japanese people and believed that the condition could have led to Japanese surrender without using the atomic bombs. =Under Secretary of State (1944‚Äì1945)= Grew returned to Washington in 1942 and served as a special assistant to Secretary Hull. In 1944 he was promoted to director of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs. From December 1944 to August 1945 he served once again as undersecretary of state. a fierce anti- communist, he opposed cooperation with the Soviets; President Roosevelt wanted closer relationships with Joseph Stalin, but the new President Harry Truman did not. Grew was again appointed as an Under Secretary of State serving from December 20, 1944 until August 15, 1945. He served as the Acting Secretary of State for most of the period from January through August 1945 while the Secretaries of State Edward Stettinius and James F. Byrnes were away at conferences. Among high-level officials in Washington, Grew was the most knowledgeable regarding Japanese issues. Grew was also the author of an influential book about Japan, titled Ten Years in Japan. Grew advocated a soft peace that would be acceptable to the Japanese people, and maintain an honorable status for the Emperor. He successfully opposed treating the Emperor as a war criminal, and thereby prepared the way for a speedy Japanese surrender, and friendly postwar relations during which Japan was closely supervised by American officials.

Encyclopedia of American Biography (1975) pp. 455-456 Forcible return of Soviet POWs By May 1945, the U.S. held a number of Soviet prisoners-of-war (POWs) who had been captured while serving voluntarily or involuntarilyNewland, Samuel, Cossacks in the German Army, 1941‚Äì1945, Routledge Press (1991), , , p. 32 in some capacity in the German Army, mostly as rear area personnel (ammunition bearers, cooks, drivers, sanitation orderlies, or guards). Unlike the German prisoners, who were looking forward to release at war's end, the Soviet prisoners urgently requested asylum in the United States, or at least repatriation to a country not under Soviet occupation, as they knew they would be shot by Joseph Stalin as traitors for being captured (under Soviet law, one only had to surrender to earn the death penalty).Tolstoy, Nikolai, Stalin's Secret War, New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston (1981), Blackwell, Jon, \\"1945: Prisoners' dilemma\\", The Trentonian The question of the Soviet POWs' conduct was difficult to determine, though not their fate if repatriated. Most of the Soviet POWs stated that they had been given a choice by the Germans: volunteer for labor duty with the German army, or be turned over to the Gestapo for execution or service in an arbeitslager (a camp used to work prisoners until they died of starvation or illness). In any case, in Stalin's eyes they were dead men, as they had 1) been captured alive, 2) had been 'contaminated' by contact with those in bourgeois Western nations, and 3) had been found in service with the German army. Notified of their impending transfer to Soviet authorities, a riot at their POW camp erupted; while no one was killed by the guards, some were wounded while other Soviet prisoners hanged themselves; President Truman granted the men a temporary reprieve. Nevertheless, Grew, as Acting Secretary of State, signed an order on July 11, 1945 forcing the repatriation of the Soviet POWs to the Soviet Union. Soviet cooperation, it was believed, would prove necessary to remake the face of postwar Europe. On August 31, 1945, the 153 survivors were officially returned to the Soviet Union; their ultimate fate is unknown. =Other work= Grew's book Sport and Travel in the Far East was a favorite one of Roosevelt's. The introduction to the 1910 Houghton Mifflin printing of the book features the following introduction written by Roosevelt: In 1945, after Grew left the State Department, he wrote two volumes of professional memoirs, published in 1952.

Through her paternal grandfather, she was a great-granddaughter of famed American naval hero Oliver Hazard Perry. Together, Joseph and Alice were the parents of: * Lilla Cabot Grew (1907‚Äì1994), who married Jay Pierrepont Moffat (1896‚Äì1943), the American Ambassador to Canada, in 1927.

The river rises in the Northern Oregon Coast Range in Clatsop County at . Flowing generally north, the river enters the Columbia at John Day Point, east of Tongue Point and about east of Astoria. It passes under U.S. Route 30 near the unincorporated community of John Day (not to be confused with the city of the same name in Grant County). The mouth of the river is about upstream from the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific. The John Day River has only one named tributary, Jack Creek, which enters from the left. The river is named for John Day, a hunter and fur trapper who took part in William Price Hunt's overland expedition for John Jacob Astor in 1811‚Äì12. There's a John Day River in eastern Oregon, a John Day Dam, a city John Day, and John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, which were all named after John Day. John Day Point, a cape located at the mouth of the river and protruding into Cathlamet Bay, takes its name from the river, as did a former railway station in the vicinity. Lewis and Clark, who camped near here in 1805, referred to the river as Kekemarke, their version of a Native American name. Lewis and Clark write about the river in their journals. The river was known as Swan Creek by Charles Wilkes, of the U.S. Exploring Expedition and was documented as such on his illustrated map. There's a railroad swing bridge crossing the mouth of the river. The tracks were used by Lewis and Clark Explorer Train which is no longer operating. The railroad bridge has a clearance of 8 feet. Tidal currents control the river throughout most of its length. Moored houseboats cover some of the shorelines on both sides of the river.

The boat launch is accessed off Oregon Highway 30. The boat launch puts users into the John Day River just before it enters the Columbia River, giving users access to both. The river can be accessed for about 3.5 miles upstream once you leave the boat ramp. John Day County Park Boat Launch  Marsh  An uncommon tidal marsh exists along the John Day River. The Marsh is a little over 24 acres owned by North Coast Land Conservancy. The John Day River Marsh is part of the Columbia Quiet Waters initiative which covers the lower Columbia River swamp.

Now living in Toronto and working as a bike courier, Hinzman faces a court martial and a possible five-year prison sentence if he returns to the United States.

His request to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court was rejected in November 2007. At that time, he filed for a pre-removal risk assessment with the citizenship and immigration department, which determines if a denied refugee applicant would be subject to torture, death or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishmentIn an indirect reference to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the word used by the Toronto Star is \\"prosecution.\\" But, for purposes of clarity and precision, this has been replaced with a quote taken directly from the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, paragraph 97(b), which uses the phrase, \\"a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\\" if returned to their country of origin.

Along with his wife, Nga Nguyen, he began attending meetings of the Religious Society of Friends in January 2002.

Amnesty International notes that Hinzman \\"took reasonable steps to register his conscientious objection through seeking non-combatant status in [August] 2002, an application which was rejected [April 2003].\\" This means that he tried for eight months, unsuccessfully, to be officially and legally referred to as a \\"conscientious objector\\". His unit was deployed to take part in the war in Afghanistan later in 2002. Hinzman fulfilled a non- combat role there while his conscientious objector application was being processed. It was ultimately denied, and he then returned to his regular unit, serving as its armorer. When his unit received orders to join in the Iraq War, Hinzman deserted, crossing the border into Canada with his wife and son. Life in Canada He filed a refugee claim upon his arrival in Canada, in January 2004. He is one of at least 28 soldiers actively seeking refugee status in Canada after deserting the United States military out of opposition to the Iraq conflict. While waiting for various legal decisions to be made on his case, Hinzman and his family continued to live in Toronto, Ontario. Hinzman, along with fellow deserter Brandon Hughey, has become a popular figure in the anti-war movement. He occasionally travels to other Canadian cities to speak on campuses and at peace rallies. Hinzman has also drawn criticism, and during his hearing stated that he has received death threats from American citizens. If and when his legal options are exhausted, Hinzman will then face the prospect of deportation from Canada and extradition to U.S. military custody. If he is ultimately deported, he faces court martial in the US Army. If the Army pursues a general court-martial, he could be sentenced to punishment of up to five years in prison and a dishonorable discharge for the crime of \\"desertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.\\" In a May 12, 2005 Media Briefing, Amnesty International stated: > Amnesty International considers Mr. Jeremy Hinzman to have a genuine > conscientious objection to serving as a combatant in the US forces in Iraq. > Amnesty International further considers that he took reasonable steps to > register his conscientious objection through seeking non-combatant status in > 2002, an application which was rejected. Accordingly, should he be > imprisoned upon his return to the United States, Amnesty International would > consider him to be a prisoner of conscience. Hinzman's experience with the Canadian legal and political systems =Hearing at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada= Hinzman's first hearing was held from December 6 to December 8, 2004 at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada presided over by Coram Brian P. Goodman. It was the first of similar refugee applications. Hinzman's lawyer Jeffry House pointed out a precedent set by federal court Judge Arthur Stone in 1995 who approved refugee status for a deserter from Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Stone wrote, \\"There is a range of military activity which is simply never permissible in that it violates basic international standards. This includes ... non-defensive incursions into foreign territory.\\" The case of Iraq War resisters clearly became more than a legal issue when Canadian government lawyers entered the situation and presented arguments to the Immigration and Refugee Board adjudicator just prior to this precedent-setting hearing. \\"Government lawyers argued at Hinzman's immigration hearing that the entire question of the war's legality was \\"irrelevant.\\"... The federal immigration officer adjudicating the case [(Brian P. Goodman)] agreed. He ruled [November 12, 2004] that Hinzman may not use the legal basis of the Iraq War to justify his ... claim.\\"On March 16, 2005, Brian P. Goodman, Coram at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, wrote the following paragraph 10 of his decision: > After carefully considering written submissions, I ruled on November 12, > 2004, for the reasons set out in my Interlocutory Reasons of that date, that > Mr. Hinzman's allegation that US military action in Iraq is illegal because > it is not authorized by the United Nations (UN) Charter, or UN Resolution is > not relevant to the question of whether it is \\"the type of military action\\" > which \\"is condemned by the international community, as contrary to basic > rules of human conduct,\\" within the meaning of paragraph 171 of the Handbook > on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status4 (the Handbook) of > the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). I > ruled that, consequently, evidence with respect to the legality of the US > embarking on military action in Iraq, would not be admitted into evidence at > the hearing of these claims.\\" See paragraph 10 at this source: In his decision, Goodman referred to paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (the Handbook) of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which states > \\"171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a > sufficient reason for claiming refugee status after desertion or draft- > evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his > government regarding the political justification for a particular military > action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an > individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international > community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for > desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of > the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.\\" Source: Handbook on > Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 > Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees The claim for refugee status was ultimately rejected. The government at the time was the Liberal Party of Canada led by Prime Minister Paul Martin; and the lawyer representing that government's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Judy Sgro, was Janet Chisholm. Reporting on Brian P. Goodman's decision, the BBC stated that the ruling \\"did not come as a surprise ... [Canadian] officials are aware that accusing Washington of persecuting its own citizens would cause an international diplomatic incident\\". =Federal Court Appeal= Justice Anne L. Mactavish presided over the Federal Court case of Hinzman v. Canada, and released her ruling on March 31, 2006 upholding the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board.Hinzman v. Canada Federal Court decision. Accessed 2008-06-18Federal Court - Cour f√©d√©rale (Canada) In her decision, Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility as follows: \\"An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war- time conduct is otherwise proper.\\"Hinzman v. Canada Federal Court decision. Paras (157) and (158). Accessed 2008-06-18 Alex Neve, who taught international human rights and refugee law at Osgoode Hall Law School, expressed concern that Mactavish's decision sets a precedent whereby \\"those at senior levels who have an objection to war may [seek refugee status], and those who deploy who have an objection may not. This runs contrary to other international law rulings.\\" One of those rulings is Nuremberg Principle IV, which reads, \\"The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\\" \\"The main arguments advanced by Hinzman's lawyer, Jeffry House, [were] that the war in Iraq is against international law and that Hinzman ... would have been forced to participate in unlawful acts had he gone.\\" =Supreme Court of Canada= On Nov 15, 2007, a quorum of the Supreme Court of Canada made of Justices Michel Bastarache, Rosalie Abella, and Louise Charron refused an application to have the Court hear the case on appeal, without giving reasons.See Sections 32111 and 32112 here: In an editorial for the Ottawa Citizen, Lawrence Hill accused the courts of a double standard concerning the 1995 decision where the Federal Court of Appeal granted refugee status to a deserter from Iraq. =Political aftermath in 2007 and 2008= \\"In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision, NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow asked the federal standing committee on citizenship and immigration to vote in favour of allowing conscientious objectors who have refused or left American military service in Iraq to be allowed to stay in Canada.\\" On December 6, 2007, after some amendments to Chow's original motion, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration adopted a motion recommending that \\"the government immediately implement a program to allow conscientious objectors and their immediate family members (partners and dependents), who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations and do not have a criminal record, to apply for permanent resident status and remain in Canada; and that the government should immediately cease any removal or deportation actions that may have already commenced against such individuals.\\" On June 3, 2008, the Parliament of Canada passed a motion (137 to 110) which recommended that the government immediately implement a program which would \\"allow conscientious objectors ... to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations ... to ... remain in Canada.\\" The motion gained international attention from the New York Times, Britain's BBC, and the New Zealand press. On July 22, 2008, Officer S.Parr issued a negative decision on the Hinzman application to stay in Canada on \\"Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds.\\" On July 25, 2008, she also issued a distinctly separate negative decision on the Hinzman application to stay in Canada as refugees (in their \\"Pre-Removal Risk Assessment\\") On August 13, 2008, the Canada Border Services Agency ordered Jeremy Hinzman, along with his wife, son, and baby daughter, to leave the country by September 23, 2008. In response to that order, \\"at a press conference ... [Sept 18, 2008], Bob Rae, the Liberal Foreign Affairs Critic joined U.S. Iraq War resister Jeremy Hinzman to make an urgent appeal to the Conservative government to stop the imminent deportation of Hinzman and his family. ...\\" \\"He [also] urged the government to support a motion passed earlier this year by all parties, except the Conservatives, to let [all eligible] conscientious objectors take up permanent residence.\\" =The stay of deportation= On September 22, 2008 Hinzman \\"and his family were granted a last-minute stay of deportation Monday by a Federal Court judge while the court decides whether to hear their appeal. ... The judge's decision will allow the family to remain in Toronto while the court decides whether to review a decision by Citizenship and Immigration officials not to let the Hinzmans remain in Canada on 'Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds'.\\" (This was a distinctly separate legal effort from the refugee application and its accompanying Pre-Removal Risk Assessment.) At the September 22, 2008, hearing, \\"Hinzman's lawyer Alyssa Manning told Justice Richard Mosley that new evidence suggests outspoken critics of the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq face harsher treatment than other deserters. For example, she said, deserter Robin Long was sentenced to 15 months in prison last month after prosecutors made mention of a media interview he had given in Canada before he was deported in July. ... The issue of \\"differential\\" treatment for those who have spoken out against the U.S.-led invasion appeared to trouble Mosley. \\"I don't know how it is an aggravating feature or element to be introduced in sentencing,\\" the judge said. \\"Based on the evidence and submissions before me, I am satisfied that the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not granted pending determination of their leave application,\\" Mosley said in his three- page endorsement.\\" In order to win the stay of deportation, Hinzman's lawyer, Alyssa Manning, had to show that her client would suffer \\"irreparable harm,\\" if returned to the U.S. as noted in Justice Mosley's quote (above). Manning also argued that this legal criteria of \\"irreparable harm\\" is met in another way: The permanent loss of voting privileges in the country of one's residence (which accompanies the felony of desertion in the US) also constitutes \\"irreparable harm,\\" Manning argued. The case for allowing Hinzman to stay in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds On February 10, 2009, Federal Court Justice James Russellhttp://cas-ncr-nter03.cas- satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Russell heard the appeal of the decision in the Hinzman family's \\"Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds\\" application, (not an appeal of their refugee claim). This was an application to allow the Hinzman family to stay in Canada on \\"Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds\\" (\\"H&C;\\"). On April 24, 2009, the judge upheld the negative decision in the Hinzmans' H&C; application. (His judgment was officially issued June 2, 2009.) However, this was appealed to a higher court, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal, on May 25, 2010. On July 6, 2010, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that a Canadian immigration official (S. Parr) decision (July 22, 2008), and also the lower court's upholding of that decision (June 2, 2009), both failed to consider the \\"hardships\\" of Hinzman. The court said the rejection of Hinzman's permanent residence application was \\"significantly flawed\\" because the officer did not take into consideration Hinzman's \\"strong moral and religious beliefs\\" against participation in war. That means officials must take another look at Hinzman's application to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Hinzman's lawyer, Alyssa Manning, said, \\"This officer missed the point and only considered refugee-type questions.\\" Refugee cases typically only consider risk to life or risk of persecution. \\"An H&C; [officer] is supposed to consider humanitarian and compassionate values ‚Äî the questions inherent with a H&C; application,\\" Manning said. \\"Hinzman's beliefs, his whole reasons for being in Canada in the first place, weren't considered by the H&C; officer, and that's what was significantly flawed about [the officer's] decision.\\" Hinzman's case will now go back for another hearing before a different immigration officer. Michelle Robidoux, a spokeswoman with the War Resisters Support Campaign, said the appellate ruling is important for other war resisters in Canada as well. (See full length court decision) Arguments * The March 16, 2005 IRB Decision full text can be found at: Hinzman Decisions Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada It has been widely argued that Hinzman is not a prisoner of conscience because he has not been persecuted for his claimed new-found beliefs. In the United States military, desertion is a crime, specifically a federal offense under Article 85 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, despite his claimed motivation. Hinzman's application for conscientious objector status was denied due to the fact that he was known to have made statements to the effect that he would consider participating in certain types of defensive actions. Conscientious objector status is only granted to those in the US military who object to all warfare, not to military personnel who object to a specific war or conflict. Hinzman enlisted voluntarily in the Army, volunteered for infantry duty, and further volunteered for airborne training, a series of deliberate and conscious decisions on Hinzman's part which would practically guarantee combat duty. These circumstances cause critics to be skeptical as to the sincerity of Hinzman's claims to being a conscientious objector. Such critics have suggested that, if Hinzman were sincere in his beliefs, he would return to the United States voluntarily and accept whatever consequences his actions and beliefs might bring about. Key to this discussion are three questions: 1. Are soldiers legally allowed to change their minds if they encounter new information? 2. Did Hinzman encounter new information? 3. At what point in his service did Hinzman acquire new information? The answer to the last two questions have been answered in Hinzman's sworn testimony (see above links to court cases). The answer to the first question one is \\"yes\\" according to the following international statutes: On March 8, 1995, the UN Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/83 stated that \\"persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service.\\" That position was re-affirmed in 1998, when the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights document called \\"Conscientious objection to military service, United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77\\" officially recognized that \\"persons [already] performing military service may develop conscientious objections.\\" In 1998, the Human Rights Commission reiterates previous statements and added \\"states should ... refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors ... to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service.\\" It also encouraged states \\"to consider granting asylum to those conscientious objectors compelled to leave their country of origin because they fear persecution owing to their refusal to perform military service.\\" In popular culture A live theater production entitled, The Hearing of Jeremy Hinzman was staged in August 2012, in Toronto, as part of the annual Summerworks Theatre Festival. It was written by Josh Bloch & Oonagh Duncan, produced by Foundry Theatre Company, and directed by Richard Greenblatt. According to Toronto's Now Magazine, the drama was \\"Based on the real-life case of an Iraq War deserter who was put on trial in 2004 to determine his status as a refugee in Canada, this example of verbatim theatre debates the legality of the 2003 U.S. invasion, and the rights of individual soldiers to think for themselves.\\" Notes References * Dept. of the Army Pamphlet 27-9, Military Judges Benchbook, Section 3-9-2 * Federal Court to review U.S. military deserter case, CBC News, February 9, 2006 * Manual for Courts-Martial United States (2008 Ed.), Article 85‚ÄîDesertion, p.

Biography  Barreto was born in Rio de Janeiro on March 3, 1959. She spent her childhood in S√£o Paulo, where she lived until she was 13 years old. In the 1970s she moved to Rio Grande do Sul where she completed her formal education, graduating from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in 1985. During the 1990s she lived in the United States, working on a studio at Stanford University. Barreto currently lives in Eldorado do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul with her husband, the Brazilian artist Mauro Fuke and their daughter.  Education  Between 1975 and 1978 Barreto took art and drawing courses at the Ateli√™ Livre da Prefeitura de Porto Alegre. In 1984, she studied painting and drawing with Luiz Paulo Baravelli (1942) and Rubens Gerchman (1942 ‚Äì 2008) respectively. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Design from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in 1985.  Career  In 1985, the same year of her graduation, Barreto the Museu de Arte do Rio Grande do Sul (Margs) in Porto Alegre featured her first solo exhibit and in 1988 her work was featured in the 10¬∫ Sal√£o Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas at the Funda√ß√£o Nacional de Arte (Funarte). During the 1990' - after several pitches to galleries in S√£o Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro - Lia was taken on by the Thomas Cohn Arte Contempor√¢nea gallery in Rio, the same gallery credited with launching the careers of Leda Catunda and Leonilson. The Thomas Cohn gallery featured her first exhibit outside of Porto Alegre. Following her national recognition, between 1993 and 1994 Lia lived as fellow in Stanford University with a grant awarded by the International Fellowship in the Visual Arts. In 1997 she exhibited her work at the 6¬™ Bienal de Havana, at the Biennial of Los Angeles and at the 1¬™ Bienal de Artes Visuais do Mercosul, consolidating her international career. Several galleries have featured solo exhibitions of Lia Menna Barreto's work. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Galeria Fortes Vila√ßa has hosted her [ Projeto 2001 ], Origem do Afeto and assorted other works in the last decade. In Porto Alegre, her work has appeared in the Di√°rio de uma Boneca, the Exerc√≠cios Afetivos (MARGS), the Galeria Iber√™ Camargo and the Galeria Arte e Fato. In Rio de Janeiro, the Thomas Cohn Arte Contempor√¢nea show featured her works in 1990, 1992, and 1995.  Critical Reception  Lia is most famous (or infamous, rather) for her deconstruction of childhood through the transmogrification of dolls and plastic toys, which she began to explore during the 1990s. Katia Kanton, writing in Poliester Magazine, describes her work this way: \\"In her strange formal operations, Lia Menna Barreto defies the sweetened way of looking at the world of children. Her radical vision engenders a relevant social commentary that is involved with and questions the oppression of the everyday experience, full of mutilations and losses and feelings of safety and danger.\\" Also on the subject of Barreto's work with dolls, Paulo Herkenhoff says: \\"In Menna Barreto's work, the experience is that of the unlearning and of the transgression. The crisis, more precisely, is that of the subject itself.\\" References * Katia Kanton. \\"Lia Menna Barreto defies the sweetened way of looking at the world of children.\\" Poliester Magazine, vol 6, n 21, 1997/98 * Waquil, I.

Portobello came into existence as a small suburb south of the city of Dublin in the 18th century, centred on Richmond St. During the following century it was completely developed, transforming an area of private estates and farmland into solid Victorian red-bricked living quarters for the middle classes (on the larger streets), and terraced housing bordering the canal for the working classes. As a fast-expanding suburb during the 19th century Portobello attracted many upwardly-mobile families whose members went on to play important roles in politics, the arts and the sciences. Towards the end of the century came an influx of Jews, refugees from pogroms in Eastern Europe, which gave the name \\"Little Jerusalem\\" to the area. It is in the postal district of Dublin 8. It is in the local government electoral area of Dublin South East Inner City and the D√°il Constituency of Dublin Bay South. History The name Portobello also describes the stretch of the Grand Canal leading from Robert Emmet Bridge (Clanbrassil Street) to the bridge from South Richmond Street to Rathmines. Although usually referred to as Portobello Bridge, the correct name is La Touche Bridge (named after William Digges La Touche (1747‚Äì1803), scion of a prominent Dublin business family and a director of the Grand Canal Company). Like the Portobello Road of London and Portobello, Edinburgh, Dublin's Portobello was named for the capture by Admiral Edward Vernon in 1739 of Portobelo, Col√≥n on Panama's Caribbean Coast, during the conflict between the United Kingdom and Spain known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. =17th century= A century before the naming of the suburb, an eventful battle took place in the neighbourhood ‚Äì the Battle of Rathmines. In the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì1649) incursions were made into the area as far as St. Kevin's church by bands of Confederate soldiers stationed in Wicklow. They made off with cattle, horses and the occasional wealthy merchant.F. Elrington Ball: A History of the County Dublin. 1903. Part II. page 102 After the Irish united with the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, an attempt was made to take Dublin. In the summer of 1649 the Duke of Ormonde, head of the forces of Royalists and Irish soldiers, approached Dublin, where the Parliamentarian army was holed up. For some unaccountable reason he took his army over to Finglas, where he spent a month, which allowed the Roundheads to reinforce and plan their attack. By the time Ormonde's main force moved around to the south of the city, the Roundheads were ready and fighting broke out. Ormonde's army was defeated, many of them killed, and the place where they fell (mainly between Rathmines and Ranelagh) was known for a long time as the Bloody Fields.F. Elrington Ball: A History of the County Dublin. 1903. Part II. page 103 et passim The name of the Bleeding Horse pub in Camden Street reputedly originated at this time from a horse wandering from the scene of the battle to St. Kevin's Port (now Camden Street). The Bleeding Horse pub is reputed to be the second oldest pub in Dublin, allegedly licensed in 1649. Writers such as James Joyce, Oliver St. John Gogarty and John Elwood were familiar with this tavern. =18th century= Portobello was part of the Manor of St. Sepulchre, one of the liberties of Dublin. The courthouse (still standing) and gaol for the use of the manor were located at the corner of Long Lane and New Bride Street. =19th and 20th centuries= The barracks The nearby Portobello Barracks (now Cathal Brugha Barracks) was constructed between 1810 and 1815, and has been in continual use since then. In 1817, William Windham Sadlier successfully flew in a hot air balloon from Portobello Barracks to Holyhead in North Wales. The 1837 Ordnance Survey map showed one building on the western side of Richmond St. (excluding property belonging to the Portobello Hotel), which corresponds to no. 34, which was the Caroline Records shop (closed in 2003).1837 OS map In 1867, at the time of the Fenian Uprising, security was stepped up, and an innocent young resident of Bloomfield Avenue, walking his dog in the vicinity, was accused of breaking and entry, among other things. Admittedly, he had a hard time explaining away the gun and eighteen bullets he had in his pocket, but he was acquitted of any wrongdoing. The barracks was the scene of a sensational murder on 27 December 1873, when the body of Gunner Colin Donaldson was found slumped across the bed of Anne Wyndford Marshall, in the apartment she shared with her husband. He had been poisoned with Hydrogen cyanide, which Mrs. Marshall had purchased in Rathmines a few days previously. The inquest on 8 January 1874 heard that Donaldson and Marshall had had disagreements on several occasions but ended up on good terms. Although the evidence was stacked against her, at her trial on 10 February the jury found Mrs. Marshall not guilty. Portobello Barracks was, up until the 1916 Rising, the home of the 4th Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, which was under the command of John Henry Patterson.The Zion Muleteers of Gallipoli, Jewish Virtual Library The barracks was adopted as General Michael Collins' Military Headquarters after the Irish War of Independence. The barracks hospital became Collins' home when he set up his headquarters, it was from here that he set off to Cork, the day he was killed 22 August 1922. The basin Portobello about 1840.

In 1812 Richmond Basin, Portobello, (later called the \\"City Basin\\"), located between Lennox Street and the canal, was opened as a water reservoir for the south side of the city. From 1860 investigations of the water quality coming from the Basin showed that it was not up to standard ‚Äì in particular, levels of sulphuric acid were relatively high. Public representatives from Rathmines were unwilling to cough up the necessary money for a new water-works, but the will of the majority prevailed, and the new Vartry Reservoir was completed in 1863.Samuel A. Ossory Fitzpatrick: A Historical and Topographical Account of the City 1907 The hotel The hotel at the harbour was opened in 1807 (the architect was James Colbourne). In 1858 it was taken over by a Catholic order of nuns, who used it as an asylum (St. Mary's) for blind girls. A few years later they successfully appealed to the Guardians of the South Dublin Union for some finance (it cost ¬£10 to keep a girl for a year), though the Irish Times in an editorial frowned upon this proselytising by \\"Romanists\\", while they lauded the efforts of the Protestant-run \\"Home for Orphans\\" at 7 South Richmond Street (which advertised frequently for \\"fresh souls to save\\" in the same newspaper). Ten years later the Asylum was sold to a Mr. Isaac Cole, who renovated it and returned it to its original function as a hotel, to accommodate 100 persons. It was popular among officers visiting the nearby Portobello Barracks (who would occasionally pop across South Richmond Street to the Grand Canal Tavern for a drink) and claimed it was the nearest hotel to the Royal Dublin Society grounds. However, it was slow in providing catering facilities ‚Äì in 1871 a Rathmines businessman, in a letter to the Irish Times, lamented the absence of restaurants in the neighbourhood, and enjoined upon Mr. Cole to provide same, preferably a two-course meal for two shillings (the price to include beer and punch). In the 20th century the building became a nursing home. The observatory Thomas Grubb (1800‚Äì1878), a notable optician, developed his first telescope in a small house between Portobello Bridge and Charlemont Bridge and erected a public observatory at No. 1 Upper Charlemont Street. He founded the Grubb Telescope Company. One of his earliest instruments ‚Äì the telescope for Markree Observatory in County Sligo ‚Äì was, for several years, the largest telescope in the world. They provided the telescopes for many observatories worldwide, including Melbourne, Vienna and Aldershot Observatory in 1891. The company was acquired in 1925 by Charles Algernon Parsons and renamed Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd. Development A new cafe and one of the oldest houses in Lennox St., facing Synge St. Most of the area was developed in the latter half of the 19th century, the houses along the South Circular Road being built between 1850 and 1870, although the smaller houses off Lennox Street were built by the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company some time later, from 1885 (just in time, in fact, for the increasing number of Jews looking for houses in the area). This company also built houses on that part of Portobello Basin that was filled in 1883. In 1868, a new street was opened to connect Harold's Cross with Lower Clanbrassil Street. The Lord Mayor, the Aldermen and Frederick Stokes, who had purchased the land and led the project, attended the opening. The street was to be called Kingsland Street, but in fact, that name was never used, and it became Upper Clanbrassil Street. =Transport= From the 1850s, horse-drawn omnibuses provided transport along South Richmond Street from Rathmines to the city centre. On 6 October 1871 work was commenced on the Dublin tram system on Rathmines Road, a few yards from Portobello Bridge. They came into operation the following year, linking Rathgar, via Richmond Street, with College Green. There was just one standard fare within the city limits, which was much cheaper than the old horse-drawn omnibuses. That year also the long-awaited improvements to Portobello Bridge (after the fatal accident of 1861) were carried out, the Tramway Company paying one third of the total cost of ¬£300. A Dublin tramways tram crosses over the Grand Canal. At the time the trams were introduced an impediment to efficient transport along Richmond Street was the curve in the street at Moyer's building works (west corner of Lennox Street, was part of the Portobello College complex until its demolition in 2006). The constant traffic in and out of Moyer's blocked the traffic at this narrow spot. Despite complaints, the curve was never removed, and is there to this day. The former Church of Ireland St. Kevin's church now stands on the location of the old Portobello Gardens, South Circular Road, Portobello The Portobello Gardens Part of Lennox Street, Victoria Street and Florence Street stretching from the canal to the South Circular Road were part of the Kingsland estate, which contained a park with a large pond and fountains, which opened as the Royal Portobello Gardens in 1839. The name survives in Kingsland Park Avenue. From 1858, Mssrs. Kirby and Webb leased the Portobello Gardens. Kirby was a pyrotechnician who lived in Sackville Street. During the summer months, gas and Chinese lamps illuminated the gardens, a band played outdoors, and the public were entertained by acrobats, dancers and \\"a highly trained troupe of performing dogs\\". And of course, fireworks. In June 1850, the celebrated circus owner and performer, Pablo Fanque (a black man, later immortalised in The Beatles song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" written entirely from his circus advertisement) announced that the sponsor of the events at the gardens \\"has the honor to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and the Public that he has entered into an arrangement with Mr. Pablo Fanque for three Grand Equestrian Day fetes, which will take place on the 10th, 12th, and 14th of June in an immense Pavilion which will be erected for the purpose.\\" The same advertisements announced performances by R. W. Pelham, the American minstrel.The Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser, 10 June 1850. A huge crowd attraction at the gardens was the well-known tightrope walker Charles Blondin, who first performed at the gardens in August 1860. The previous year he had caused a sensation by crossing the Niagara Falls on a tightrope. In May, at the Crystal Palace, he had carried across a stove on the rope, then, still suspended on the wire, proceeded to cook omelettes, which he distributed to the audience below. On the evening of 23 August 1860, however, as the crowd packed the gardens, the tightrope broke, which led to the supporting scaffolding collapsing. Blondin was not injured, but two workers who were on the scaffolding fell to their deaths. Although they appeared as witnesses at an initial investigation, Blondin and his manager failed to appear at a further one (they were in the USA) and a warrant was issued for their arrest. However, things must have been ironed out, because August of the following year found the \\"far-famed unambulist performing his arduous and daring exploits\\" at the gardens, followed by \\"Madame Veroni's magic exploits\\". Meanwhile, the proprietor of the gardens, Kirby, the pyrotechnician, was having problems with a pyromaniac, several attempts having been made on his property. In 1862 Kirby was the victim of arson, both the music hall in the gardens and his house in Sackville Street were burned down, resulting in high claims for compensation. Plans for developing the land at the gardens for housing started around this time. Frederick Stokes, J.P., an Englishman, the main developer of Rathmines and Portobello at the time, and Chairman of the Rathmines Township Commissioners, who drained it and let it out in building lots, purchased the land. Kingsland Park The original name of Victoria Street was Kingsland Park, which was developed from 1865 by Frederick Stokes. Some of the houses in this street remained empty for some time after they were built and were frequented by \\"ladies of the night\\", who catered to the nearby Portobello Barracks. As a result, the street acquired a bad reputation and respectable families moved out. Even after the ladies moved on, the bad reputation of the street remained, and thus the name was changed to Victoria Street. For a similar reason, Liverpool Road became Portobello Road and Bloomfield Place/Rosanna Place became Windsor Terrace. Harrington St. RC church (St. Kevin's), built 1871 Emorville Across the road from Portobello Gardens was the Emorville Estate, which was sold and developed from around the mid-1860s by Joseph Kelly, proprietor of the City Saw Mills in Thomas Street. Today Emorville Avenue marks the spot. Before it was broken up Leinster Cricket Club (founded 1852) used it as their grounds, until they moved to their present grounds in Observatory Lane in 1865. Portobello had a cricket team of its own, but the location of its grounds has yet to be discovered. Included in this development was a small DMP police station at the corner of Emor Street and South Circular Road, which closed after the Free State came into being.GRO, Dublin, 1911 Census Street names Several older streets in the neighbourhood (i.e., Richmond, Harrington, Lennox, Heytesbury and Camden) were named after British Viceroys. Newer streets were often named after the estates they were built on. Stamer Street, developed around 1880, was named after Sir William Stamer, Lord Mayor in 1809 and 1819 (a relative of his, Standish O'Grady, was killed in a duel in 1830 by Captain Smith from Portobello Barracks, who received twelve months for manslaughter). Foundlings left at Harrington Street church were usually named after one of the surrounding streets.Harrington Street (St. Kevin's) Church Baptism Registry 1871‚Äì1890 Between 1916 and 1921, Portobello and its eponymously named barracks were the scene of several incidents (see Of historical interest). Kelly's Corner, looking towards Camden Street, in the mid-1950s The main employer locally in the inter-war period and afterwards was Ever-Ready Batteries at Portobello Harbour. The factory is now closed and small businesses and attractive apartments occupy the space. The remainder of Portobello Harbour, located next to the Ever-Ready factory, was drained in 1948 and largely filled in. The Bleeding Horse (it was renamed The Falcon between 1965 and 1985), Camden Street, in 1972 In the 1960s, the Garda Club opened in Harrington Street (it is still used for social occasions) and Synge Street School obtained a new building fronting onto Heytesbury Street. The Bleeding Horse pub came under new management, introduced plastic fittings and changed its name to The Falcon. Starting in the 1980s Kelly's Corner was re-developed. Old Camden Street and Charlotte Street disappeared and the ruined buildings there made way for the Camden Court Hotel. The north side of Harcourt road was developed, Stein's the opticians being the last to go in the first phase, and Gleeson's pub in the second. Old Camden Street (left) and Sth. Richmond Street (right) in 1972 In the 1990s, the east side of Charlemont Street and Grand Parade made way for offices, apartments and the Hilton Hotel. The Falcon was renovated and became again The Bleeding Horse. A few years later the Luas made its appearance on the old Harcourt Street-Bray railway line. Nowadays community groups meet in St. Kevin's Hall, Bloomfield Avenue and Heytesbury Street. A monthly market is held behind the Bernard Shaw pub on Richmond Street. The Grand Canal looking west from Portobello bridge The reclaimed land at Portobello Harbour is now a leisure area and often used for skateboarding. Next to it is the private Lamrin Business School, and just around the corner are various shops, pubs and restaurants, giving the locality a lively and vibrant air. South Richmond Street is part of the \\"Golden Mile\\" of music venues and bars leading into the city centre. The Grand Canal received a much- needed restoration in the mid-1980s and again more recently. The canal is still thriving in a leisurely way and now serves as a picturesque amenity much frequented by the local population, not to mention the Corporation swans. Little Jerusalem Leonard's Corner and Upper Clanbrassil Street, looking towards Robert Emmet Bridge The area was also known as Little Jerusalem because in the first half of the Twentieth century it was at the heart of the Jewish community in Dublin. The first Jews fleeing conditions in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) arrived in the early 1870s and eventually settled off Lower Clanbrassil Street. Over the next few decades as they became more prosperous many moved to the South Circular Road, Longwood Avenue, Bloomfield Avenue (where a Jewish school was opened) and other parts of Portobello. The shopping area of Little Jerusalem stretched along Lower Clanbrassil Street where there were many Jewish shops and businesses, mixed with local Irish, for example Eastman butchers, who carried out the ritual slaughtering until a Jewish slaughterhouse was established in Vincent Street. For a long time local (non-Jewish) children earned their pocket money by lighting fires and doing odd-jobs (the Shabbat goy) for the Jews on their Sabbath. Jews in Dublin Plaque to trade union and synagogue, 52 Camden St. Founder of the well-known family firm, Myer Wigoder was born in Lithuania but had to flee after a pogrom. He started a Hebrew class near Kelly's Corner and a synagogue in Camden Street. His son Harry lived at 32 Charlemont Street and was a well-known soccer-player. Another son, a doctor, married into the family of dentist Harry/Henry Bradlaw (son of Robert Brudno of Smorgon naturalised as Robert Bradlaw), of 4 Harrington St. Robert Bradlaw became a leader of the community and founded a synagogue in St. Kevin's Parade and the cemetery in Dolphin's Barn, where he is buried. Also from Lithuania, Ada Shillman came to Dublin in 1892 and became a midwife. She started a dispensary for Jewish women in Bloomfield Avenue and helped found Saint Ultan's Children's Hospital in Charlemont Street. Her son Bernard became a distinguished Senior Counsel. In the local elections for Dublin Corporation in 1902, the Socialist candidate James Connolly, standing for Wood Quay ward, was the only candidate to distribute his election leaflets in the area in Yiddish. The International Tailors, Machinists and Pressers' Trade Union was founded in November 1908 (and registered in April 1909) by Jewish clothing workers hailing from the South Circular Road area. Its HQ was at 52 Camden Street (located next to the headquarters for Concern Worldwide). Aaron Klein of 14 Warren Street was its first treasurer. A later Secretary was Isaac Baker from Emorville Avenue. The Jewish Museum on Walworth Road The Jewish presence in the area declined following the end of World War II, with a number of Jews emigrating to Israel, and the majority leaving for New York. Though the main Jewish population that remained in Dublin have moved out to Terenure, just five kilometres (three miles) away, a small number still live in the area, but their own shops, schools, and small businesses no longer exist. The Irish Jewish Museum is located on Walworth Road. One of the items in the museum includes a Guinness bottle sold in the area with a customised label printed in Hebrew. The long- standing Kosher bakery, the Bretzel, is still in Lennox Street, under new management. In early 2011 the museum launched an appeal for a ¬£9 million expansion of its Walworth Road premises, which was supported by the Office of Public Works.The Jewish Chronicale, Carl Nelkin During the 1916 Easter Rising, several Jewish women from the community smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin's Jewish quarter, to the then named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the artist Estella Solomons who used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch at the back of her family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time precisely because they were women.\\"Solomons' Rising: The Personal Revolution of an Irish Jewish Woman in 1916\\", tabletmag.com Institutions The main school in the area is Synge Street CBS, which was the setting for the award-winning 2016 film, Sing Street. The movie, directed by John Carney (director), was mostly made in Dublin including in areas around Portobello like the Catholic Church in Harrington Street (St. Kevin's), named after the nearby St. Kevin's medieval church. The school was built next to the Christian Brothers monastery in 1871. On the other side of Synge Street is St. Kevin's Hall, which used to be the meeting place for the Catholic Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. There used to be a Jewish school in Bloomfield Avenue (now Bloomfield House) and synagogues in Walworth Road (established 1917, now the Jewish Museum) and in Adelaide Road but these are all closed now (new facilities have been set up elsewhere). On the Adelaide Road a Presbyterian Church (still functioning) was built in 1841 for a congregation of 800, and in 1863 a smaller chapel for the Irvingites, which later became St. Finian's Lutheran church (also still functioning). The former Methodist Church in Victoria Street The many Muslims now living in the area attend the Dublin Mosque (formerly the Donore Presbyterian Church, built 1884) further along the South Circular Road, and there is also a centre in Harrington Street. The local Church of Ireland church, St. Kevin's (whose construction, in 1883, was financed by a bequest from a Miss Jane Shannon, of Rathgar, architect, Thomas Drew), was closed in the 1970s and tastefully converted to apartments, while the adjacent church buildings became a community centre. The little church at the top of Victoria Street formerly belonged to the Methodist Congregation, called Kingsland Methodist Church, and after closing in the 1950s was used as a women's Employment Exchange. The Methodists also ran the Female Orphanage School in Harrington St., which was founded in 1804 and closed in the mid-20th century. Portobello College was a private institution established in 1989 and located mainly in Portobello House. It was firstly taken over by the Institute of Education (under owner Raymond Kearns) and then in 2009 by the Dublin Business School (owned by Kaplan, Inc, a subsidiary of The Washington Post Company). The students were relocated to the DBS facility in George's St. In 2011, one of India's largest educational institutions, the Rayat Bahra Group, moved into nearby Harbour House, once a part of Portobello College, and set up the Lamrin Business School.Irish Times, 8 June 2011 In 2009, a new national and cultural centre was opened in the Christian Brothers monastery on Synge St. called The Lantern, which is aiming to be a place of hospitality to promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue.The Lantern centre The name \\"lantern\\" was chosen to celebrate the life of Nano Nagle who searched the back lanes of Cork each evening with her lantern seeking those who lacked food and shelter. She inspired Edmund Ignatius Rice to found the Congregation of Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers with her work for the poor and disadvantaged.Opening of the Lantern centre on Edmund Rice website In May 2011, The new Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter opened a Cathal Brugha Barracks Visitors centre to the public commemorating those that fought for the Irish War of Independence.Minister Shatter opens historic visitor centre in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Irish Defence forces, www.military.ie Notable residents The earliest written accounts we have of residents in the area date from the 18th century‚Äîas the city spread southwards houses on the main roads or in select by-roads such as Charlemont Mall were occupied by the better-off citizens. This trend continued in the first half of the 19th century, but with the development of the smaller streets from around 1860 and finally the artisans' dwellings, a mix of classes ended up in the area. By the beginning of the 20th century, the grand houses that had been erected along the Grand Canal had been turned into poverty-stricken tenements, while more exclusive suburbs such as Terenure and Rathgar became the havens of the rich.

Of historical interest =1861: A terrible tragedy at Portobello Bridge= At 9 o'clock on the evening of Saturday, 6 April 1861 near Portobello Bridge, a horse-drawn bus, driven by Patrick Hardy, had just dropped off a passenger and started up the steep incline of the bridge when one of the horses started to rear. The driver tried to turn the horses but both horses became uncontrollable with fear and backed the bus through the wooden rails of the bridge. The bus, horses and six passengers inside the bus, plunged into the dark cold waters of the canal lock, which was about 6 metres (20 feet) deep, with 3 metres (10 feet) of water at the bottom. The conductor was able to jump clear and a passing policeman pulled the driver from the water. Despite the frantic efforts of passers-by, in particular a constable and a soldier from Portobello Barracks who broke their way into the submerged bus, all inside were drowned. One of those killed was the father of the Gunne brothers, who opened the Gaiety Theatre. Two were mothers, each with a little girl, one of them a niece of Daniel O'Connell. The repercussions of this tragedy were felt for a long time in the area. Passengers on horse-drawn vehicles had to alight at Portobello Bridge and walk across the bridge before continuing their journey. According to some accounts, on the night of the accident a brilliant light was seen to rise from the canal water and turn into a human shape. They say the ghost of a lock-keeper, who drowned himself after being sacked for drunkenness, was to blame for the tragedy. =1914: Pork butchers attack= During the evening of 15 August 1914 a series of anti-German attacks took place in the city by pro- Allied or British sympathizers - also known commonly as \\"Redmonites\\" during World War I. One of the most shocking was George Reitz Pork butchers at Leonard's Corner on the South Circular Road, Portobello. The mob was reportedly led by a newly enlisted soldier. The fullest account of the attack on George Reitz's premises appeared in the Irish Worker on 22 August 1914. Under the heading of \\"German Baiting: The Police Cowardice\\" the correspondent described the scene. Having first arrested Reitz himself, the Dublin Metropolitan Police then left his premises unprotected and allowed the mob to proceed unhindered in destroying that shop and robbing its contents. Meanwhile, the DMP themselves stood \\"idly by\\" and laughed away the night as they observed the \\"sport\\".The justification of James Connolly The Irish Citizen Army feared that the Jewish shops adjacent to Reitz's would be the next targets for the mob. =1916: A terse reply= During the Easter Rising in 1916, the Irish Citizen Army sent a group of men to seize a delaying position at Portobello Bridge, to allow fortifications to be constructed in the city centre. They were led by a James Joyce (not the author) who worked in Davy's bar near the bridge‚Äîthe bar was to be used as a military outpost. When his unit burst in, Davy, the bar owner, sacked Joyce, giving him one week's notice. Joyce then told Davy he had five minutes to get out!The 1916 insurrection in the Liberties Indimedia Ireland =1916: Murder of Sheehy- Skeffington= Francis Sheehy-Skeffington Also during the Easter Rising, members of the British 11th East Surrey Regiment at Portobello Bridge arrested the pacifist Francis Sheehy-Skeffington on 25 April because his name was 'on a list', as he returned to his home in Rathmines from touring the city pasting up leaflets calling people to a meeting to form groups to stop looting of property by slum-dwellers. He was taken to Portobello Barracks, where he was held as an enemy sympathiser. Later that evening, he was taken out as a hostage with a raiding party led by Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst of the Royal Irish Rifles, to the home and shop of Alderman James Kelly, at the corner of Camden Street and Harcourt Road (from which the name \\"Kelly's Corner\\" derives). Mistaking the Alderman (a conservative) for a different Alderman Kelly, the soldiers arrested two men who were there, gutter journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick McIntyre, then destroyed the shop with hand grenades. On the way back to Rathmines, Bowen-Colthurst and his party murdered two unarmed civilians, one of them a 17-year-old boy from Mountpleasant Avenue returning from Rathmines church. The former Kelly's tobacconist at Kelly's Corner, where Sheehy-Skeffington was taken The following morning Bowen-Colthurst ‚Äî an Anglo- Irish ultra-loyalist who was a scion of Dripsey Castle in Cork, and a cousin of the writer Elizabeth Bowen, ordered his sergeant to organise a firing squad to shoot dead Sheehy-Skeffington and the two pro-British journalists Dickson (a disabled Scotsman) and McIntyre. The three were shot in the back as they walked towards a wall in the barracks yard, then buried in shallow graves in the same yard. The British authorities tried to hush up the killings, and offered Bowen-Colthurst command of a regiment in Newry. Sir Francis Fletcher Vane, an officer in Portobello Barracks, tried to have Bowen-Colthurst arrested for murder, and was himself then dishonourably discharged from the army (as the Public Records Office nicely put it: \\"this officer was relegated to unemployment owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case in the Sinn F√©in rebellion\\"). Bowen-Colthurst pleaded insanity at a later investigation and was sent to the mental health facility at Holloway (HM Prison), from where he was quietly released 18 months later. He then emigrated to Canada, where he lived for the rest of his life. =1920: Dead and wounded after riot in Richmond Street= On 22 March 1920, an incident, typical of the time, occurred in the area. A large group of British soldiers of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, were returning, singing, to Portobello Barracks after a night out on the town. They started jostling pedestrians in Grafton Street and hissed the Sinn F√©in bank in Harcourt Street. At Kelly's Corner a crowd gathered who attacked them with stones. By the time they reached Lennox Street gunfire had broken out, one soldier being shot in the chest. A running fight along the street developed until armed reinforcements arrived from the barracks. Gunfire broke out between the two sides, and the soldiers forced the crowd back towards Camden Street, firing at them when they did not obey the command to disperse. A van driver and a female domestic were killed, and many injured. =1920: Shooting of Harry Kells= On 15 April 1920 parts of Portobello, including the \\"Jewish quarters\\", were subject to the largest raid ever carried out by British troops in Dublin.New York Times, 16 April 1920 This was due to the shooting on the previous day of Detective Constable Harry Kells, of the DMP G Division, in Camden St. He was rushed to the Meath Hospital where he died. Harry Kells lived at 7 Pleasants St. and had been carrying out identity parades among the many republican inmates in Mountjoy Prison. Two of those sought were Sinn F√©in members Michael and William Kavanagh who lived at 5 Pleasants St., who had previously been \\"fingered\\" by Kells, and it was thought they would seek refuge among friends in the neighbourhood.Kavanagh Family Over 100 people were arrested that day. =1922: The trial of Erskine Childers, Portobello Barracks= In November 1922 Erskine Childers was arrested by Irish Free State troops, he was transferred from a Wicklow Jail to Portobello Barracks in Dublin where he was brutally tortured. On the 17 November he was Court Martialled on a charge of possession of a revolver given to him by Michael Collins, he had since they were both on the same side, prior to the Irish Civil War. He was consequently sentenced to death at Beggars Bush. His execution brought widespread condemnation at home and abroad, it was the result of a draconian emergency act introduced by the Irish Free State government following Michael Collins assassination, the death sentence for anyone caught armed without authorization.Robert Erskine Childers, ExecutedTodayfirstworldwar =1923: Stamer Street Shooting= On the night of 14 November 1923, two Jewish men were shot, one of whom Emmanuel Kahn, 24, of Lennox Street died, at the corner of Stamer St./Lennox St. They were returning home from the Jewish Social Club, which was located at 3 Harrington St. The shooting followed an altercation on Stamer St. with officers of the Irish National Army, who had been on their way by taxi from Griffith Barracks to Beggar's Bush Barracks. Ralph Laffan, the taxi driver that night, was charged with the murder, but fled to Mexico to join his brother Fred, who had also been involved that night. He claimed he was mistaken for his brother and was later found not guilty. The apparently motiveless murders remained a mystery until files released in 2007 pointed to Commandant James Patrick Conroy, who harboured a personal vendetta against Jews, as the main instigator. He resigned from the army shortly after the shooting and emigrated.Andrew Bushe, Sunday Independent, 24 June 2007 =1966: Nelson's head goes missing from a Clanbrassil Street shed= In 1966 a group of students from National College of Art and Design stole the head of lord Nelson's Pillar, which had been blown up by Irish nationalists in March 1966. The head had been stored in a shed off Clanbrassil Street by Dublin City Corporation. The students broke into the shed and put the head in the back of a hatchback and made off with it. The head later appeared in numerous locations most notably the set of a Dubliners concert and also in a London antique shop close to Trafalgar square where the other pillar is located.

Armageddon 2419 A.D. is a science fiction novella by Philip Francis Nowlan that first appeared in the August 1928 issue of the pulp magazine Amazing Stories. A sequel called The Airlords of Han was published in the March 1929 issue of Amazing Stories. Both stories are now in the public domain in the US according to the Project Gutenberg website. In the 1960s, Nowlan's two novellas were combined by editor Donald A. Wollheim into one paperback novel, titled Armageddon 2419 A.D. The characters and setting eventually evolved into Buck Rogers. Overview Nowlan‚Äôs novella tells about the United States in the 25th century, conquered by Hans in 2109 AD and only now beginning to rebel. Sometime after World War I, nearly all the European powers joined forces against the United States. Although the US won the war, both sides were devastated by the conflict. Taking advantage of the chaos that followed, the \\"Russian Soviets\\" (Soviet Union) joined forces with the \\"Mongolians\\" to take over Europe. The US collapsed economically and stagnated while the \\"Mongolians\\" turned against the Russians and defeated them as part of their campaign of world conquest. American efforts to avoid war with the \\"Mongolians\\" failed, and in 2109 AD, the latter attacked the US using fleets of airships armed with disintegrator rays. They attacked from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and down from Canada. After conquering the US and Canada, these \\"Airlords of Han\\" ruled North America as a province of the world empire, from 15 great cities they established across the continent. They ignored the Americans, who were left to fend for themselves in the forests and mountains as the \\"Mongolians'\\" advanced technology prevented the need for slave labor. From time to time, they raid American land \\"to keep the 'wild' Americans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent their becoming a menace to the Han civilization.\\" Living in cooperative gangs and hiding in the forests from the Hans, Americans secretly rebuild their civilization and develop the new technologies \\"inertron\\" and \\"ultron\\". Inertron is a substance with \\"reverse weight\\" (anti-gravitational properties), so that a person carrying an amount of inertron equal to most of his weight (in the form of a ‚Äújumper‚Äù ‚Äì \\"rocket motors encased in inertron blocks and strapped to the back\\") can travel rapidly across country in long leaps. Ultron, in turn, is an \\"absolutely invisible and non-reflective solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity, which has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those pulsations known as light, electricity and heat.\\" The Americans use these technologies, as well as explosive rockets and radio frequencies the enemy cannot detect, in their struggle with the Hans. \\"The Airlords of Han\\" was the cover story for Amazing Stories (March 1929) Plot summary The main character and the narrator in Armageddon 2419 A.D. is Anthony Rogers, who later appears in the various comic strips, radio shows, and film serials that follow as \\"Buck Rogers\\". Rogers recounts the events of the ‚ÄúSecond War of Independence‚Äù that precedes the first victory of Americans over Hans, in which he plays an important role. Born in 1898, he was a veteran of the Great War (World War I) and was by 1927 working for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation. He was investigating reports of unusual phenomena in abandoned coal mines near Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. On December 15, while investigating one of the lower levels of a mine, there was a cave-in. Exposed to radioactive gas, Rogers fell into \\"a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages of katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on physical or mental faculties.\\" Rogers remained in ‚Äúsleep‚Äù for 492 years. He awakens in 2419 and, thinking he has been asleep for just several hours, wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests (what had been Pennsylvania almost five centuries before). He finally notices a wounded boy-like-figure, clad in strange clothes and moving in giant leaps, who appears to be under attack by others. He defends the person, killing one of the attackers and scaring off the rest. It turns out that he is helping a woman, Wilma Deering, who, on ‚Äúair patrol‚Äù, was attacked by an enemy gang, the \\"Bad Bloods\\", which is presumed to have allied themselves with the Hans. Wilma takes Rogers to her camp, where he is to meet the bosses of her gang. He is invited to either stay with their gang or leave and visit other gangs. They hope Rogers‚Äô experience and the knowledge he gained fighting in the First World War may be useful in their struggle with the Hans. Rogers stays with the gang for several days, learns about the community life of Americans in the 25th century, and makes friends with the people, especially with Wilma, with whom he spends a lot of time. He also experiences a Han air raid, during which he manages to destroy one of the enemy ships. Rogers and his friends hurry to the bosses to report the incident and explain the method he has used when shooting the aircraft. As the raid has caused much destruction, there is suspicion that the location of the gang‚Äôs industrial plants may have been revealed to the Hans by rival gangs. They await a fight with the Hans who will likely wish to take revenge for the destruction of their airship. The bosses direct Wilma and Rogers to investigate the wreck. While there, a Han party arrives to investigate as well. Thanks to Rogers‚Äô quick and wise instructions, he and Wilma manage to escape and shoot down some more of the Hans' ships. The day after, Wilma and Anthony get married, and Rogers becomes a member of the gang. In the meantime, knowing Rogers‚Äô technique, the other gangs start the hunt for Han ships. The Hans respond by improving the security of their ships, forcing the Americans to develop new tactics to press their sudden advantage and identify the traitors working with the Han. Anthony develops a plan to get the records of the traitorous transaction, which are kept somewhere in the Han city of Nu- Yok. With the help of other gangs, he creates a team that will go with him. They learn that the traitors are the Sinsings, the gang located not far from Nu-Yok. The Americans appreciate Rogers‚Äô courage and brave deeds and, grateful to him, make him the new boss. He instantly reorganizes the governing structures of the gang by creating new offices and makes plans for the battle with the Sinsings, again using the knowledge he gained in the First World War. The raid on Sinsings turns out to be a great success and gives the Americans the confidence in their ability to overcome the Hans. Predictions of future technology Despite being written prior to World War II, the storyline accurately foreshadowed several notable advancements in technology, and in military theory and practice. These include: *Bazookas *Consumer E-purchasing *Immersive Telepresence *Night vision devices *Optical devices for small arms such as the reflector sight and red dot sight *Paratroopers *Remote piloted surveillance and attack drones *Telecommuting *The shortcomings of an air supremacy war without concomitant ground forces (proven in the Vietnam War) *Wireless phones, including the flip phone Allusions/references from other works/sequels The history leading to the situation which Rogers finds upon waking - the US weakened by a war with Europe and then conquered by overwhelming Han fleets of airships - has some similarities with H.G. Wells' The War in the Air (written in four months in 1907 and serialised and published in 1908, in The Pall Mall Magazine), already a classic at the time when Armageddon was written. In Wells' novel, the United States is attacked by Imperial Germany, New York is destroyed by the Germans, and though the Americans manage to fight off the German attack, they are then overwhelmed by enormous Sino-Japanese air fleets. After Armageddon 2419 A.D. was published, John F. Dille, the head of the National Newspaper Service, which syndicated comics and features, read Nowlan‚Äôs novella and convinced a dubious Nowlan to turn it into a daily comic strip. Dille renamed the character Buck Rogers, possibly after a cowboy hero of the same name, and hired artist Dick Calkins to do the illustrations. It was the first real science fiction comic strip, and one of the first strips to tell a continuous adventure story while also using word balloons, rather than a text box. The story of the comic strip diverges from the novel after the first few strips and never returns to it. While Armageddon 2419 A.D. heavily emphasizes war, military tactics and technology, the comic strip is based on adventures and romantic problems. The book features lethal violence and gore, while the comic strip does not. The entire \\"occupied America\\" theme of the original book was tacitly dropped, and the United States in which the comic strip Buck Rogers lives seems a direct continuation of the present-day one, which had not undergone centuries of Han occupation. Buck Rogers was a huge success, spawning many imitators such as Flash Gordon. Nowlan‚Äôs novella and script introduced the public to science fiction and prepared them for a future that involved space exploration and space/arms races, that later, indeed, was going on between the USA and the Soviet Union. While it sometimes claimed that they introduced the idea of \\"personal flight\\" with the use of devices attached to the body, this idea is based on the fact that a flying man is depicted on the cover of the August 1928 issue of Amazing Stories, which included the first part of Armageddon 2419 A.D. In fact the cover illustrates E.E. Smith's serial The Skylark of Space, which began in the same issue. Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Moon Maid saga has some similarities to Armageddon 2419 A.D., in which American \\"tribes\\" rebel against Moon people who have previously conquered the world. As noted, many of the later appearances of Buck Rogers departed widely from the original circumstances of the Han-dominated America and the hero from the past helping overturn that domination; Rogers in his numerous later incarnations was given various other past careers which did not include the Han. However, in the 1980s the original Armageddon 2419 A.D. was taken up again and authorized sequels to it were written by other authors working from an outline co-written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle and loosely tied-in with their bestseller Lucifer's Hammer (1977). The first sequel begins c. 2476 A.D., when a widowed and cantankerous 86-year-old Anthony Rogers is mysteriously rejuvenated during a resurgence of the presumed-extinct Han, now called the Pr'lan. The novels include: *Mordred by John Eric Holmes (Ace, January 1981, ) *Warrior's Blood by Richard S. McEnroe (Ace, January 1981, ) *Warrior's World by Richard S. McEnroe (Ace, October 1981, ) *Rogers' Rangers by John Silbersack (Ace, August 1983, ) See also * Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future, a 1995 novel by Martin Caidin that reimagines the events of Armageddon 2419 A.D.

The Republic of North Ossetia ‚Äì Alania is a federal subject of Russia (a republic), located in the Caucasus region. Early history Map of territory of medieval Alania (9th-12th century) Ossetian historian Ruslan S. Bzarov. Political map of the Caucasus region in 1060 Ossetian historian B. A. Kaloev. The territory of North Ossetia has been inhabited for thousands of years, being both a very fertile agricultural region and a key trade route through the Caucasus Mountains. The ancestors of the present inhabitants were a people called the Alans,Great Soviet Encyclopedia a warlike nomadic people who spoke an Iranian language. Part of the Alan people eventually settled in the Caucasus around the 7th century AD. By about the 9th century, the kingdom of Alania had arisen and had been converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries. An archbishopric was established in western Alania under the authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and many large churches were constructed (Zelenchuk churches, Shoana Church, Senty Church). Alania became a powerful state in the Caucasus, profiting greatly from the legendary Silk Road to China, which passed through its territory. From the Middle Ages onwards, Alania was beset by external enemies and suffered repeated invasions. The invasions of the Mongols and Tatars in the 13th century decimated the population, who were now known as Ossetians. Islam was introduced in the 17th century through the Kabardians, a Muslim Caucasian people. Incursions by the Khanate of Crimea and the Ottoman Empire eventually pushed Alania/Ossetia into an alliance with Russia in the 18th century. North Ossetia was among the first areas of the northern Caucasus to come under Russian domination, starting in 1774, and the capital, Vladikavkaz, was the first Russian military outpost in the region. By 1806, Ossetia was completely under Russian control. Imperial Russia The arrival of Imperial Russia led to the rapid development of the region, with industries founded and road and rail connections built to overcome Ossetia's isolation. The Georgian Military Road, which is still a crucial transport link across the mountains, was built in 1799 and a railway line was built from Vladikavkaz to Rostov-on-Don in Russia proper. The Ossetians' traditional culture inevitably underwent some russification, but their new connections with Russia and the West helped to boost local culture; the first books in the Ossetian language were printed in the late 18th century. In 1830, a military campaign led by General Ivan Abkhazov brought North Ossetia under tighter control of the Russian Empire. The area became part of the Terskaya Region of Russia in the mid-19th century. Russian Revolution and USSR After the Russian Revolution, North Ossetia became part of the short-lived Soviet Mountain Republic in 1921. It became the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast on July 7, 1924 and was then made the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), within the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, on December 5, 1936. In World War II, North Ossetia saw the high-water mark of the invasion of Russia by Nazi Germany; the Germans attempted to seize Vladikavkaz in November 1942 but were repulsed. During and after the war Stalin undertook massive deportations of whole ethnicities explaining this by anti-Sovietism, separatism and collaboration with Nazi Germany. In particular, this affected Balkars, Chechens, and Ingushs. As of 1944, the part of the Prigorodny District on the right bank of the Terek River had been part of Chechen-Ingush ASSR, but it was granted to North Ossetia in following Joseph Stalin's deportation of the Chechens and Ingush to Central Asia. Although they were eventually allowed to return from the exile, they were generally not allowed to settle in the original territories. Instead, in 1957, three districts of Stavropol Krai were granted to Chechen-Ingush ASSR. A local law passed in 1982 actually prohibited ethnic Ingush from obtaining residency permits in North Ossetia. After the USSR Map of modern North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania North Ossetian SSR finally became the first autonomous republic of the RSFSR to declare national sovereignty, on June 20, 1990 (although it still remains firmly part of Russia). In 1991, North Ossetian SSR was renamed the Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. The dissolution of the Soviet Union posed particular problems for the Ossetian people, which were divided between North Ossetia, which was part of the Russian SFSR, and South Ossetia, part of the Georgian SSR. In December 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Georgia abolished the autonomous Ossetian enclave amid the rising ethnic tensions in the region, and much of the population fled across the border to North Ossetia or Georgia proper. Some 70,000 South Ossetian refugees were resettled in North Ossetia, sparking clashes with the predominantly Ingush population in the Prigorodny District. That led to Ossetian-Ingush conflict. As well as dealing with the effects of the conflict in South Ossetia, North Ossetia has had to deal with refugees and the occasional spillover of fighting from the war in neighboring Chechnya. The bloodiest incident by far was the September 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, in which Muslim separatists of Shamil Basayev seized control of a school. In the firefight between the terrorists and Russian forces that ended the crisis, 335 civilians, the majority of them children, died.

History Car modifying has been popular among youths in the US, especially in Southern California, since the days of hot rods in the 1950s and 1960s. There is significant evidence indicating that import drag racing first started in Southern California in the mid-1960s, with modified Volkswagen Beetles, Ford Populars and Austin A40 Devons: Documentation of quarter-mile passes were published in Hot Rod Magazine as early as August 1965. Puerto Rico also has a history of pioneering import drag racing in the mid-'70s and -'80s, and it is still a popular hobby on the island. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese vehicles, mostly early smaller Hondas (Civic, Prelude), Toyotas (Celica, Corolla, Supra), Nissans (Datsun 510) and Mazdas (RX-2, RX-3) gained popularity in Southern California. To be more precise, within the city of \\"Gardena\\" at a parking lot (location) for then what was called \\"Meiji (Japanese) Market or Meiji Market Plaza\\" along with a line of other authentic Japanese retailers serving the largely Japanese communities of Gardena, Torrance, and Palos Verdes was to become the \\" 1st known and established Weekend late-night meet-up location.\\" The Young Asian-Americans and first generation \\"Issei\\" Japanese street racers from Japan and Okinawa played a particularly important role in the development of the early street racing scene. Many enthusiasts in southern California centered around the City of Gardena also began to modify their compact Japanese cars, following similar trends that originated in Japan, such as the paint schemes, modified exhausts, and engine carburation. As the Import racers and car aesthetics grew in popularity and numbers, so did the competition. Meiji Market's parking lot became very well known outside the original Japanese car crews and this attracted more outsiders to visit, as well as American Car race Crews to appear, which inevitably became somewhat problematic. This local Import Racers scene became a hotbed for pink slip racing and more aggressive tension between race crews. Non-Japanese automobile racers & car clubs started to appear from far outside the Gardena, Torrance, & South Bay communities and in approx. circa 1983-86 Import racers and midnight racers started to meet at another local restaurant called \\"Naugles,\\" which was located on Western Ave & and 186th street. Naugles was the \\"1st obvious step\\" that import racing was now gaining popularity in other Southern California communities. Street Import racing venues and street meet-up locations in nearby cities such as Carson, Ca. and Long Beach, Ca. eventually arose from the original Meiji Market Location, and then came huge drag racing events at Palmdale, California often packed in over 10,000 spectators per day. Racers like Stephan Papadakis, Ed Bergenholtz, Myles Bautista and Eric Sebastian on the West Coast dominated the first import drag racing circuit IDRC (Battle of the Imports) in the mid 1990s. Show car clubs became a huge factor within the import scene: Southern California had Team Macross 7, Team Outkast, Team Kosoku, Northern California had SVP, Sinister Racing, Team Flipspeed in the East Coast (New Jersey, Toronto). In the South, Team Himitsujigen and Team Dangerous (Texas) and Team Hawaii had Midnight Racing and Alpha Project, Guam had teams like Lowered 2 Perfection and Toys R Us, while the East Coast had the still-active Jade Crew. The Japanese racing scene can be seen in the anime series Initial D, which focuses mainly on mountain pass-racing and Wangan Midnight which deals with high-speed expressway racing. Japanese products Another part of the import scene is Japanese products that either explore or detail such racing, often introducing new fans to the scene. These are usually found through DVDs and books. The Japanese domestic market supplies high quality parts and brands for tuning Japanese cars. It is made up of various associations working together to supply products to street racers and tuners. =DVDs= Some of the more well known DVDs about the scene, apart from the anime series mentioned above, include: *Best Motoring *Hot Version *Street Fury *Torque Video Magazine *Video Option (alternatively known as JDM Option) *Drift Tengoku =Anime and manga= Two Japanese anime and manga have been attributed to the growing import scene in some form or another. A common theme in both is that characters that are depicted underdogs with hidden and untapped talent drive what amount to antiquated cars that many would deem either ready for the scrapheap or underpowered compared to much better tuned and modified cars. The anime and manga Initial D stars Takumi Fujiwara as he is introduced to touge (mountain pass racing) after it is found that he has a natural ability to race his father's specially tuned Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno. With his amazing skill he is able to defeat Mazda RX-7s, Nissan Skyline GT-Rs and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions. With this spawned several arcade games, which utilizes cars from the manga, plus other cars associated with touge racing. The cars are set up more to take the tight mountain passes and emphasis is placed more on driver ability rather than speed and power. The series at first gained popularity via fansubs and bootlegs, until Tokyopop translated both the anime and manga. However, some have criticized Tokyopop's translation of the property, with major changes to both the story and the content. After Tokyopop lost the license to Initial D in 2009, Funimation picked up the license to Initial D and re-released the first four seasons of the anime, with new subtitles and dubs more faithful to the original. On the opposite spectrum, Wangan Midnight focuses on the relatively wide Shuto Expressway of Tokyo. Akio Asakura is a high school student who likes to race on the Wangan highway. After being defeated by a doctor (and a racer as well), Tatsuya Shima's Blackbird (a Porsche 964), he accidentally acquires a monstrously powerful Nissan Fairlady Z (S30) known as The Devil Z. All but one of its previous owners were mysteriously killed in traffic accidents involving the Z, but he quickly makes a name for himself on the Wangan. The cars are designed for speed and power, and are based on the exploits of street racers who used the Wangan as their own personal racetrack. The cars often were modified to attain high power (this is reflected in the arcade game: it allows cars to be upgraded to over , at the cost of having virtually no grip) with bodykits and other modifications to make the cars go fast. While not as well known as Initial D, the series gained a cult following after the arcade game Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune was ported to the US by Namco.

Harman (August 16, 1918 ‚Äì January 30, 1997) was an American engineer, futurist, and author associated with the human potential movement. He was convinced that late industrial civilization faced a period of major cultural crisis which called for a profound transformation of human consciousness. Over a career lasting some four decades, he worked to raise public awareness on the subject through his writings and to foster relevant research through the nonprofit research institute SRI International, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), and the World Business Academy (WBA). He served as president of IONS for two decades, and he was a cofounder of the WBA. His many books include volumes coauthored with the futurist Howard Rheingold, who put forward similar views, and the mythologist Joseph Campbell. Early life and education Willis W. Harman was born in Seattle, Washington on August 16, 1918. His father was a hydroelectric engineer and his mother was a music teacher.Cornish, Edward, ed. \\"Futurists and Their Ideas\\". In The study of the future: an introduction to the art and science of understanding and shaping tomorrow's world. Transaction Publishers, 1977, pp. 157‚Äì62. He attended the Western Washington College of Education before moving on to graduate from the University of Washington in 1939 with a B.S. in electrical engineering. After graduation, he worked for General Electric and then joined the Navy as an electrical officer. He was stationed on the USS Maryland (BB-46) but was ashore at his home near Pearl Harbor during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. After the end of World War II, Harman received his M.S. in physics and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1948. Academic career Harman taught for several years at the University of Florida before joining the Stanford faculty in 1952 to teach electrical engineering and physics. In 1966, his faculty line was transferred from the Department of Electrical Engineering to the Department of Engineering-Economic Systems (since absorbed by the Department of Management Science and Engineering) at the behest of founding chair Bill Linvill.https://maps.org/news- letters/v07n3/07337hof.htmlhttps://stanford.app.box.com/s/hbcsb98pxmow3ocxl2ay5wv9a75lics8 In 1954, he attended a summer seminar on ethics, meditation, and the spiritual life that had a transformative effect on both his thinking and his career.Harman, Willis. Untitled chapter in Frederick Franck, Janis Roze, and Richard Connolly, eds., What Does It Mean to Be Human?, pp. 79-80. He later said of this experience that it \\"opened up vast areas I didn't even know were there. It completely changed my concept of what is important in education, and in time led to various activities in the field of humanistic psychology.\\" Harman became convinced that Western culture was facing a spiritual and moral crisis stemming from the ravages of industrialism and its economic logic, which he came to call the \\"World Macroproblem\\".Gibson, Donald. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power, p. 66. As Harman saw it, \\"If you look at the assumptions underlying our economic system ‚Äì especially the ones regarding the prerogatives of ownership ‚Äì and then you look at the goals we humans have about how we want to live our lives, there is no compatibility. The assumptions can never lead to the goals.\\" In his view, this crisis that called for development of both an \\"ecological ethic\\" and a \\"self-realization ethic\\". In short, society needed to transform its institutions to support the personal development of individual human beings within an environment of limited resources. Because Harman considered humans an integral part of the natural world, he saw individual self-realization and environmental sustainability as synergistic rather than contradictory paths forward. Harman also recognized the large (and often problematic) role that unconscious processes play in human culture and foresaw that work was needed to better understand how such processes might be harnessed in positive ways. Harman incorporated his new perspective in a popular Stanford graduate seminar called \\"The Human Potential\\" that covered topics ranging from meditation to psychedelic drugs to parapsychology.Roberts, Thomas B. Psychedelic Horizons, n.p. In 1980, he was appointed a regent of the University of California by Governor Jerry Brown.\\"Willis W. Harman\\". SFGate, February 6, 1997. He served as a regent for ten years. SRI International From 1967 to 1984, Harman held joint appointments as a senior social scientist at SRI International and director of SRI's Educational Policy Research Center. There he initiated a research program focused on solving the problems posed by uncontrolled industrial development. This work led to his 1976 book An Incomplete Guide to the Future, with its vision of a transindustrial society. Unlike many futurists, Harman did not believe that the future was predictable simply by projecting current trends; consequently, a hallmark of his work is his ability to conceive ideas about the future that don't clearly stem from present tendencies. At SRI, Harman recruited Alfred Matthew Hubbard to the Alternative Futures Project, one of the goals of which was to introduce business and thought leaders to LSD. Institute of Noetic Sciences Harman was invited by astronaut Edgar Mitchell and writer/speaker Christopher Hegarty (\\"How to Manage Your Boss\\") to join the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in Sausalito in 1973, the year it was founded. He went on to serve as its president from 1978 until his death in 1997. He described IONS' mission as bringing science and religion back together, though in ways that would require fundamental changes in both.\\"Encouraging a 'Global Mind Change'\\". Yoga Journal, Sept.-Oct. 1989, pp. 64-65. Harman was in charge of \\"Global Mind Change\\", then one of four major IONS programs, and was a prophet of Social Media and the Internet. Besides supporting Harman's 1988 book of the same title, it sponsored citizen tours of the USSR and other activities. World Business Academy In 1987, Harman cofounded the World Business Academy with Rinaldo Brutoco and other businesspeople.Harman, Willis. \\"Why a World Business Academy?\\". World Business Academy website. Originally published 1987. The WBA grew out of his conviction that business would play a critical role in the period of profound social transformation that Harman foresaw. Its goal was to foster smoother change by helping business leaders assume new roles of social responsibility. Family and death In 1941, Harman married Charlene Reamer, who survived him. They had three daughters (Billie, Mary, and Susan) and a son, Dean.\\"Willis W. Harman\\". SFGate, February 6, 1997. Harman died of brain cancer.\\"Willis W.

He was an Indian mathematician and Jain philosopher and scholar. He was also known as a famous orator and an accomplished poet. His most reputed work is the Jain treatise Dhavala.Satkhandagama : Dhavala (Jivasthana) Satparupana-I (Enunciation of Existence-I) An English Translation of Part 1 of the Dhavala Commentary on the Satkhandagama of Acarya Pushpadanta & Bhutabali Dhavala commentary by Acarya Virasena English tr. by Prof. Nandlal Jain, Ed. by Prof. Ashok Jain The late Dr. Hiralal Jain places the completion of this treatise in 816 AD. Virasena was a noted mathematician. He gave the derivation of the volume of a frustum by a sort of infinite procedure. He worked with the concept of ardhaccheda: the number of times a number could be divided by 2; effectively base-2 logarithms. He also worked with logarithms in base 3 (trakacheda) and base 4 (caturthacheda). Virasena gave the approximate formula C = 3d + (16d+16)/113 to relate the circumference of a circle, C, to its diameter, d. For large values of d, this gives the approximation œÄ ‚âà 355/113 = 3.14159292..., which is more accurate than the approximation œÄ ‚âà 3.1416 given by Aryabhata in the Aryabhatiya. Life Virasena was proficient in astrology, grammar, logic, mathematics and prosody. He wrote Dhavala, a commentary on Jain canon Shatakhandagama. He also started the work on Jayadhavalaa which was competed by his disciples. He was among the jewels of Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha.

Born into a wealthy and politically powerful merchant family, he is best known as the Massachusetts official responsible for implementing the provisions of the Stamp Act, for which he was hanged in effigy. He never actually carried out those duties, and was later commissioned as the province's lieutenant governor. Early life Andrew Oliver was born in Boston, capital of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay, on March 28, 1706. His father, Daniel Oliver, was a wealthy and politically active merchant,Bell, p. 515 and his mother, Elizabeth Belcher Oliver, was the sister of Jonathan Belcher, son of another wealthy merchant and governor of the province in the 1730s.Batinski, p. 8 Andrew had two brothers: Daniel Oliver (1704‚Äì1727) and Peter Oliver (1713‚Äì1791). Characterized as \\"sober and pious\\", Andrew was sent to Harvard College, where he graduated in 1724. Oliver then entered the family business, setting up a merchant business with his brother Peter that concentrated on wine and textiles. The business was successful, and the brothers eventually controlled Boston's Long Wharf. On March 20, 1728, Oliver married Mary Fitch, the daughter of Colonel Thomas Fitch. The couple had three children before Mary died in 1732; only one, a son named Andrew, survived to adulthood. After Mary's death Oliver traveled to England, returning to Massachusetts in 1734.Bell, p. 516 On December 19, 1734, he married Mary Sanford of Newport, Rhode Island, the sister-in-law of Thomas Hutchinson. The couple had fourteen children. Politics and the Stamp Act In 1737 Oliver entered politics, winning election as Boston's town auditor. He held many other local offices, and became a leader of the Hutchinson-Oliver faction, which dominated politics in colonial Massachusetts. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1742, and in 1755 was appointed provincial secretary by Acting Governor Spencer Phips. In 1765, Oliver was commissioned to administer the unpopular Stamp Act in Massachusetts. He was privately against the act, but told people he was in favor of it, leading colonists to rise against him. On August 14, he was hanged in effigy from Boston's Liberty Tree in a protest organized by the Loyal Nine, a precursor to the Sons of Liberty. That night his house and offices were ransacked by an angry crowd. On August 17, he was compelled to publicly resign his commission. On December 17, the Sons of Liberty again forced him to publicly swear that he would never act as stamp distributor. Later career Mrs. Andrew Oliver (Mary Sanford) (1713 - 1773) He was commissioned lieutenant governor of the colony when his brother-in-law Thomas Hutchinson became governor in 1771. Letters that he and Hutchinson wrote in the late 1760s during protests surrounding the Townshend Acts were published in 1773, igniting a storm of protest against both men. The business took a serious toll on Oliver's health, which suffered further after his wife died. Oliver died on March 3, 1774, after suffering from an \\"apoplectick fit\\".Bell, p. 518 His death was greeted with glee by the Sons of Liberty, and his burial was marred by acts of protest and violence. Because of the charged political climate few friends and relatives attended.Bell, p. 519 Most of Oliver's family remained Loyal during the American Revolution, and resettled in other parts of the British Empire.

He authored Ga·πáitasƒÅrasanÃÑgraha (Ganita Sara Sangraha) or the Compendium on the gist of Mathematics in 850 CE. He was patronised by the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics.The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the ... by Clifford A. Pickover: page 88 He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems.Algebra: Sets, Symbols, and the Language of Thought by John Tabak: p.43 He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle.Geometry in Ancient and Medieval India by T. A. Sarasvati Amma: page 122 MahƒÅvƒ´ra's eminence spread throughout South India and his books proved inspirational to other mathematicians in Southern India. It was translated into Telugu language by Pavuluri Mallana as Saara Sangraha Ganitamu.Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit by David Pingree: page 388 He discovered algebraic identities like a3 = a (a + b) (a ‚àí b) + b2 (a ‚àí b) + b3. He also found out the formula for nCr as [n (n ‚àí 1) (n ‚àí 2) ... (n ‚àí r + 1)] / [r (r ‚àí 1) (r ‚àí 2) ... 2 * 1]. He devised a formula which approximated the area and perimeters of ellipses and found methods to calculate the square of a number and cube roots of a number. He asserted that the square root of a negative number does not exist. Rules for decomposing fractions MahƒÅvƒ´ra's Ga·πáita-sƒÅra-sa·πÖgraha gave systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions. This follows the use of unit fractions in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period, and the ≈öulba S≈´tras' giving an approximation of equivalent to 1 + \\\\tfrac13 + \\\\tfrac1{3\\\\cdot4} - \\\\tfrac1{3\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot34}. In the Ga·πáita-sƒÅra-sa·πÖgraha (GSS), the second section of the chapter on arithmetic is named kalƒÅ-savar·πáa- vyavahƒÅra (lit. \\"the operation of the reduction of fractions\\"). In this, the bhƒÅgajƒÅti section (verses 55‚Äì98) gives rules for the following: * To express 1 as the sum of n unit fractions (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 75, examples in 76): :: 1 = \\\\frac1{1 \\\\cdot 2} + \\\\frac1{3} + \\\\frac1{3^2} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac1{3^{n-2}} + \\\\frac1{\\\\frac23 \\\\cdot 3^{n-1}} * To express 1 as the sum of an odd number of unit fractions (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 77): :: 1 = \\\\frac1{2\\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1/2} + \\\\frac1{3 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 1/2} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac1{(2n-1) \\\\cdot 2n \\\\cdot 1/2} + \\\\frac1{2n \\\\cdot 1/2} * To express a unit fraction 1/q as the sum of n other fractions with given numerators a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 78, examples in 79): :: \\\\frac1q = \\\\frac{a_1}{q(q+a_1)} + \\\\frac{a_2}{(q+a_1)(q+a_1+a_2)} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac{a_{n-1}}{(q+a_1+\\\\dots+a_{n-2})(q+a_1+\\\\dots+a_{n-1})} + \\\\frac{a_n}{a_n(q+a_1+\\\\dots+a_{n-1})} * To express any fraction p/q as a sum of unit fractions (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 80, examples in 81): : Choose an integer i such that \\\\tfrac{q+i}{p} is an integer r, then write :: \\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac{1}{r} + \\\\frac{i}{r \\\\cdot q} : and repeat the process for the second term, recursively. (Note that if i is always chosen to be the smallest such integer, this is identical to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions.) * To express a unit fraction as the sum of two other unit fractions (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 85, example in 86): :: \\\\frac1{n} = \\\\frac1{p\\\\cdot n} + \\\\frac1{\\\\frac{p\\\\cdot n}{n-1}} where p is to be chosen such that \\\\frac{p\\\\cdot n}{n-1} is an integer (for which p must be a multiple of n-1). :: \\\\frac1{a\\\\cdot b} = \\\\frac1{a(a+b)} + \\\\frac1{b(a+b)} * To express a fraction p/q as the sum of two other fractions with given numerators a and b (GSS kalƒÅsavar·πáa 87, example in 88): :: \\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\frac{ai+b}{p}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{q}{i}} + \\\\frac{b}{\\\\frac{ai+b}{p} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{q}{i} \\\\cdot{i}} where i is to be chosen such that p divides ai + b Some further rules were given in the Ga·πáita-kaumudi of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa in the 14th century.

The Hughes AIM-47 Falcon, originally GAR-9, was a very long-range high-performance air-to-air missile that shared the basic design of the earlier AIM-4 Falcon. It was developed in 1958 along with the new Hughes AN/ASG-18 radar fire-control system intended to arm the Mach 3 XF-108 Rapier interceptor aircraft and, after its cancellation, the YF-12A. It was never used operationally, but was a direct predecessor of the AIM-54 Phoenix. Development =Development for XF-108= In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force developed requirements for a high speed, high performance interceptor aircraft, originally called the LRI-X. In 1957, Hughes won the contract to supply the weapons system for this aircraft. This system consisted of the GAR-X missile and the YX-1 radar and fire control system. The original missile design had a range of 15 to 25 miles (25 to 40 km), and could be equipped with a conventional warhead or a 0.25 kiloton version of the W42 nuclear warhead. When the North American XF-108 Rapier was announced as the winner of the LRI-X contest in April 1958, the Hughes entries were redesignated GAR-9 and AN/ASG-18 on the same day. The F-108 was cancelled in September 1959, but the Air Force decided to continue development of the missile system with both warheads.Sean O'Connor, Hughes GAR-9/AIM-47 Falcon, Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles, 2004 During its development, the capabilities of the new missile grew tremendously. Growing much larger, the missile's range was extended to 100 miles (160 km), using the Aerojet- General XM59 solid-fuel motor. Since this would be beyond the range of effective semi-active radar homing, a new active-radar terminal seeker was added to the missile. This seeker was a powerful system of its own, with no effective maximum range and the resolution to be able to lock onto a target at 63 nm (116 km). Even the seeker was changed at one point, with the addition of a passive infrared homing seeker to improve terminal performance. However, that would have required the missile to grow by , and in diameter by two inches, making it too large for the F-108's weapon bay. The W-42 nuclear version was dropped in 1958 in favor of a 100-pound high-explosive design. Problems with the motor during development led to the brief consideration of using a storable liquid-fuel rocket design, but was replaced instead by the Lockheed XSR13-LP-1 solid rocket. This lowered the top speed from Mach 6 to Mach 4. In this form the GAR-9 started ground firings in August 1961. For air- launch testing at supersonic speeds the Republic XF-103 had originally been proposed as a test platform, but this aircraft was cancelled before reaching the prototype stage. Instead, B-58 Hustler s/n 55-665 was modified to house the AN/ASG-18 radar in a large protruding radome that gave it the nickname \\"Snoopy\\", and in-flight launches started in May 1962. =Development for YF-12= In 1960 Lockheed started development of the Lockheed YF-12 interceptor, as a lower-cost replacement for the F-108. The GAR-9/ASG-18 were moved to this project. The F-12 would have featured four flip-open internal weapons bays on the chines behind the cockpit, one of these filled with electronics. The F-12B bays were too small for the GAR-9, so the GAR-9B was developed with flip-out fins to reduce its diameter. It weighed . Test firings of the GAR-9A from the prototype F-12As resulted in six kills from seven launches, the lone miss due to a missile power failure (there were several non-guiding test launches as well). The missile was renamed AIM-47 in late 1962 as part of the transition to common naming for aerospace vehicles across the U.S. Department of Defense in 1962. The last launch was from a YF-12 flying at Mach 3.2 and an altitude of 74,400 feet (22,677 m) at a QB-47 target drone 500 feet (152 m) off the ground.B. Rich, Skunk Works (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1994), p. 236 In 1966, the F-12 project was cancelled just as the F-108 had been. Another project which expressed an interest in the design was the XB-70 Valkyrie, a bomber which could have carried the AIM-47 for self- defense. This aircraft was also cancelled after Soviet deployment of effective high-altitude surface-to-air missiles made high-altitude attacks on the Soviet Union impractical. In all, Hughes had built 80 pre-production AIM-47 missiles.  Legacy  The AIM-47 was used as a base for the AIM-54 Phoenix (originally the AAM-N-11), intended for the General Dynamics F-111B. This project was also canceled in 1968, but the weapon system finally found a home on the F-14 Tomcat, entering service in the early 1970s. In 1966, the basic airframe was adapted with the seeker from the AGM-45 Shrike and the warhead from the Mk. 81 bomb to create the high-speed AGM-76 Falcon anti-radar missile, although this did not see service.Andreas Parsch, Hughes AGM-76 Falcon, Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles, 2004  See also  * Missile designation  References  External links * AIM-47 Falcon missile launch AIM-047 Category:Abandoned military rocket and missile projects of the United States Category:Military equipment introduced in the 1960s ","title":"AIM-47 Falcon"},{"id":"1158600","text":"Isotype can refer to: * Isotype (biology), a duplicate of the holotype of a species * Isotype (crystallography), a synonym for isomorph * Isotype (immunology), an antibody class according to its Fc region * Isotype (picture language), a method of showing social, technological, biological and historical connections in pictorial form * Isotype (song), 2017 song by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark See also * Isotope (disambiguation) * Isoform ","title":"Isotype"},{"id":"1158609","text":"Elisabet Sahtouris is an evolution biologist, futurist, speaker, author and sustainability consultant to businesses, government agencies and other organizations.

On 7 June 1979 the Indian Space Research Organisation launched Bhaskara I honouring the mathematician.Bhaskara NASA 16 September 2017  Biography  Little is known about BhƒÅskara's life. He was probably an astronomer. cites [K S Shukla 1976; p. xxv-xxx], and Pingree, Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit, volume 4, p. 297. He was born in India in the 7th century. His astronomical education was given by his father. Bhaskara is considered the most important scholar of Aryabhata's astronomical school. He and Brahmagupta are two of the most renowned Indian mathematicians who made considerable contributions to the study of fractions.  Representation of numbers  Bhaskara's probably most important mathematical contribution concerns the representation of numbers in a positional system. The first positional representations had been known to Indian astronomers approximately 500 years prior to this work. However, these numbers, prior to Bhaskara, were written not in figures but in words or allegories and were organized in verses. For instance, the number 1 was given as moon, since it exists only once; the number 2 was represented by wings, twins, or eyes since they always occur in pairs; the number 5 was given by the (5) senses. Similar to our current decimal system, these words were aligned such that each number assigns the factor of the power of ten correspondings to its position, only in reverse order: the higher powers were right from the lower ones. His system is truly positional since the same words representing, can also be used to represent the values 40 or 400.B. van der Waerden: Erwachende Wissenschaft. √Ñgyptische, babylonische und griechische Mathematik. Birk√§user-Verlag Basel Stuttgart 1966 p. 90 Quite remarkably, he often explains a number given in this system, using the formula ankair api (\\"in figures this reads\\"), by repeating it written with the first nine Brahmi numerals, using a small circle for the zero . Contrary to his word system, however, the figures are written in descending values from left to right, exactly as we do it today. Therefore, at least since 629, the decimal system is definitely known to the Indian scientists. Presumably, Bhaskara did not invent it, but he was the first having no compunctions to use the Brahmi numerals in a scientific contribution in Sanskrit.  Further contributions  Bhaskara wrote three astronomical contributions. In 629 he annotated the Aryabhatiya, written in verses, about mathematical astronomy. The comments referred exactly to the 33 verses dealing with mathematics. There he considered variable equations and trigonometric formulae. His work Mahabhaskariya divides into eight chapters about mathematical astronomy. In chapter 7, he gives a remarkable approximation formula for sin x, that is : \\\\sin x \\\\approx \\\\frac{16x (\\\\pi - x)}{5 \\\\pi^2 - 4x (\\\\pi - x)}, \\\\qquad (0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq \\\\pi ) which he assigns to Aryabhata. It reveals a relative error of less than 1.9% (the greatest deviation \\\\frac{16}{5\\\\pi} - 1 \\\\approx 1.859\\\\% at x=0). Moreover, relations between sine and cosine, as well as between the sine of an angle >90¬∞ >180¬∞ or >270¬∞ to the sine of an angle <90¬∞ are given. Parts of Mahabhaskariya were later translated into Arabic. Bhaskara already dealt with the assertion that if p is a prime number, then 1 + (p‚Äì1)! is divisible by p. It was proved later by Al-Haitham, also mentioned by Fibonacci, and is now known as Wilson's theorem. Moreover, Bhaskara stated theorems about the solutions of today so-called Pell equations. For instance, he posed the problem: \\"Tell me, O mathematician, what is that square which multiplied by 8 becomes - together with unity - a square?\\" In modern notation, he asked for the solutions of the Pell equation 8x^2 + 1 = y^2. It has the simple solution x = 1, y = 3, or shortly (x,y) = (1,3), from which further solutions can be constructed, e.g., (x,y) = (6,17).

Patient transport is a service that transfers patients to and from medical facilities in non-emergency situations. In emergency situations, patients are transported by the emergency medical services. Non-emergency patient transport is sometimes run by the same agency. It is typically provided to a patient who needs to be transferred to a facility that can provide a higher or more specialized level of care though emergency services may be summoned if this is urgent. It may also be used to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require this specialized care, such as following successful cardiac catheterization due to a heart attack. Some countries also offer the service to patients who cannot make their own way to or from the hospital.  United States  Patient transport services are provided in the United States to convey patients to hospitals. The vehicles used are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment, and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances. Their purpose is simply to transport patients to, from or between places of treatment. These services are often provided by ambulance services using non-emergency vehicles, but may be subject to tendering processes.  United Kingdom  Patient transport services in the United Kingdom were generally provided by ambulance services after the establishment of the NHS, and originally all emergency ambulance crews began as patient transport drivers. Since the establishment of the NHS internal market in 1990, these services have often been contracted to private providers. The patinet transport service is intended for patients who have a medical need for assisted transport. This is a separate provision from the Hospital Travel Costs scheme, which is means tested, to fund low income patients' journeys to hospital. Clinical commissioning groups often arranged for one CCG to manage the tendering and contracting process for a wide area. Healthwatch England has found a great deal of patient dissatisfaction with services who complain that they are treated as packages to be delivered rather than as people with individual needs. Cornwall Clinical Commissioning Group proposed to restrict this provision for dialysis patients for those who did not have specific medical or financial reasons in 2018 but changed their minds after a campaign led by Kidney Care UK and decided to fund transport for patients requiring dialysis three times a week for a minimum of six weeks, or six times a month for a minimum of three months. After a string of market failures NHS England announced a review into the cost of patient transport services and the way they are commissioned in October 2019.

Life and naval career Mugford commanded the schooner Franklin in the Continental Navy, serving through 1775 in John Manley's squadron off Boston. He captured British ship Hope with a large cargo of military stores and powder, and took his prize into Boston, running under the noses of the British fleet lying in the outer harbor. Franklin was attacked during the night of May 19, 1776 in the company of Lady Washington (a small privateer schooner with a crew of 7 commanded by Joseph Cunningham) by British boarders claiming to be friends from Boston; Captain Mugford was killed in action. The report of General Ward, the overall American commander in Boston, stated: > Captain Mugford was very fiercely attacked by twelve or thirteen boats full > of men, but he and his men exerted themselves with remarkable bravery, beat > off the enemy, sunk several of their boats, and killed a number of their > men; it is supposed they lost sixty or seventy. The intrepid Captain Mugford > fell a little before the enemy left his schooner; he was ran through with a > lance while he was cutting off the hands of the pirates as they attempted to > board him, and it was said that with his own hands he cut off five pairs of > theirs. ... The Lady Washington. ... was attacked by five boats, which were > supposed to contain near or quite a hundred men; but after repeated efforts > to board her they were beaten off by the intrepidity and exertions of the > little company, who gloriously defended the Lady against the brutal > ravishers of liberty. Mugford had captured a British ship and, having delivered her and her cargo to Boston, he enlisted the Lady Washington to ferry him back to his own ship, the Franklin. A dozen or more British boats attempted to intercept him but arrived too late. Instead they tried to board by pretending to be friendly. Mugford warned them to keep their distance and fired his cannons loaded with musket balls when they ignored him. The attackers split into two groups, with the larger attacking the Franklin and the smaller attacking the Lady Washington. According to a report in the Pennsylvania Evening Post, Mugford was killed by a musket ball rather than a lance. General Ward's report is probably more accurate in this respect. Namesake Two United States Navy ships, USS Mugford, have been named for him.

The Upper Paleolithic (or Upper Palaeolithic, Late Stone Age) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Very broadly, it dates to between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago (the beginning of the Holocene), according to some theories coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity in early modern humans, until the advent of the Neolithic Revolution and agriculture. Anatomically modern humans (i.e. Homo sapiens) are believed to have emerged in Africa around 300.000 years ago, although these lifestyles changed very little from that of archaic humans of the Middle Paleolithic, until about 50,000 years ago, when there was a marked increase in the diversity of artefacts. This period coincides with the expansion of modern humans from Africa throughout Asia and Eurasia, which contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals. The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity.Gilman, Antonio. 1996. Explaining the Upper Palaeolithic Revolution. pp. 220‚Äì39 (Chap. 8) in Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: A Reader. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell The peopling of Australia most likely took place before c. 60 ka. Europe was peopled after c. 45 ka. Anatomically modern humans are known to have expanded northward into Siberia as far as the 58th parallel by about 45 ka (Ust'-Ishim man). The Upper Paleolithic is divided by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), during about 25 to 15 ka. The peopling of the Americas occurred during this time, with East and Central Asia populations reaching the Bering land bridge after about 35 ka, and expanding into the Americas by about 15 ka. In Western Eurasia, the Paleolithic eases into the so-called Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic from the end of the LGM, beginning 15 ka. The Holocene glacial retreat begins 11.7 ka (10th millennium BC), falling well into the Old World Epipaleolithic, and marking the beginning of the earliest forms of farming in the Fertile Crescent. Lifestyle and technology European early modern human, or Cro-Magnon. Mus√©e de Pr√©histoire des gorges du Verdon Both Homo erectus and Neanderthals used the same crude stone tools. Archaeologist Richard G. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the stone tool kit of archaic hominids as impossible to categorize. He argues that almost everywhere, whether Asia, Africa or Europe, before 50,000 years ago all the stone tools are much alike and unsophisticated. Ahmarian Culture, Nahal Boqer, Israel, 47,000-40,000 BP. Israel Museum. Firstly among the artefacts of Africa, archeologists found they could differentiate and classify those of less than 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools. These new stone-tool types have been described as being distinctly differentiated from each other; each tool had a specific purpose. The early modern humans who expanded into Europe, commonly referred to as the Cro-Magnons, left many sophisticated stone tools, carved and engraved pieces on bone, ivory and antler, cave paintings and Venus figurines.\\"'Modern' Behavior Began 40,000 Years Ago In Africa\\", Science Daily, July 1998 The Neanderthals continued to use Mousterian stone tool technology and possibly Chatelperronian technology. These tools disappeared from the archeological record at around the same time the Neanderthals themselves disappeared from the fossil record, about 40,000 cal BP. Stone core for making fine blades, Boqer Tachtit, Negev, Israel, circa 40,000 BP. Settlements were often located in narrow valley bottoms, possibly associated with hunting of passing herds of animals. Some of them may have been occupied year round, though more commonly they appear to have been used seasonally; people moved between the sites to exploit different food sources at different times of the year. Hunting was important, and caribou/wild reindeer \\"may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting.\\"\\"In North America and Eurasia the species has long been an important resource‚Äîin many areas the most important resource‚Äîfor peoples' inhabiting the northern boreal forest and tundra regions. Known human dependence on caribou/wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the Middle Pleistocene (Banfield 1961:170; Kurt√©n 1968:170) and continuing to the present....The caribou/wild reindeer is thus an animal that has been a major resource for humans throughout a tremendous geographic area and across a time span of tens of thousands of years.\\" Ernest S. Burch, Jr. \\"The Caribou/Wild Reindeer as a Human Resource\\", American Antiquity, Vol. 37, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 339‚Äì368. Technological advances included significant developments in flint tool manufacturing, with industries based on fine blades rather than simpler and shorter flakes. Burins and racloirs were used to work bone, antler and hides. Advanced darts and harpoons also appear in this period, along with the fish hook, the oil lamp, rope, and the eyed needle. Fishing of pelagic fish species and navigating the open ocean is evidenced by sites from Timor and Buka (Solomon islands). The changes in human behavior have been attributed to changes in climate, encompassing a number of global temperature drops. These led to a worsening of the already bitter cold of the last glacial period (popularly but incorrectly called the last ice age). Such changes may have reduced the supply of usable timber and forced people to look at other materials. In addition, flint becomes brittle at low temperatures and may not have functioned as a tool. Some scholars argue that the appearance of complex or abstract language made these behavior changes possible. The complexity of the new human capabilities hints that humans were less capable of planning or foresight before 40,000 years, while the emergence of cooperative and coherent communication marked a new era of cultural development.\\"No Last Word on Language Origins\\" , Bellarmine University Changes in climate and geography The Upper Paleolithic covered the second half of the Last glacial period from 50,000 to 10,000 before present, until the warming of the Holocene. Ice core data from Antarctica and Greenland. The climate of the period in Europe saw dramatic changes, and included the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest phase of the last glacial period, which lasted from about 26.5 to 19 kya, being coldest at the end, before a relatively rapid warming (all dates vary somewhat for different areas, and in different studies). During the Maximum, most of Northern Europe was covered by an ice-sheet, forcing human populations into the areas known as Last Glacial Maximum refugia, including modern Italy and the Balkans, parts of the Iberian Peninsula and areas around the Black Sea. This period saw cultures such as the Solutrean in France and Spain. Human life may have continued on top of the ice sheet, but we know next to nothing about it, and very little about the human life that preceded the European glaciers. In the early part of the period, up to about 30 kya, the Mousterian Pluvial made northern Africa, including the Sahara, well-watered and with lower temperatures than today; after the end of the Pluvial the Sahara became arid. thumbupright=1.25leftEuropean Last Glacial Maximum refuges, 20,000 BP. The Last Glacial Maximum was followed by the Aller√∏d oscillation, a warm and moist global interstadial that occurred around 13.5 to 13.8 kya. Then there was a very rapid onset, perhaps within as little as a decade, of the cold and dry Younger Dryas climate period, giving sub-arctic conditions to much of northern Europe. The Preboreal rise in temperatures also began sharply around 10.3 kya, and by its end around 9.0 kya had brought temperatures nearly to present day levels, although the climate was wetter. This period saw the Upper Paleolithic give way to the start of the following Mesolithic cultural period. As the glaciers receded sea levels rose; the English Channel, Irish Sea and North Sea were land at this time, and the Black Sea a fresh-water lake. In particular the Atlantic coastline was initially far out to sea in modern terms in most areas, though the Mediterranean coastline has retreated far less, except in the north of the Adriatic and the Aegean. The rise in sea levels continued until at least 7.5 kya (5500 BC), so evidence of human activity along Europe's coasts in the Upper Paleolithic is mostly lost, though some traces have been recovered by fishing boats and marine archaeology, especially from Doggerland, the lost area beneath the North Sea.

In the alchemical context, takwin refers to the creation of synthetic life in the laboratory, up to and including human life. Whether Jabir meant this goal to be interpreted literally is unknown. Jabir states in his Book of Stones (4:12) that \\"The purpose is to baffle and lead into error everyone except those whom God loves and provides for!\\" The Book of Stones was deliberately written in a highly esoteric code, so that only those who had been initiated into his alchemical school could understand them.

He was also an astrologer. Parameshvara was a proponent of observational astronomy in medieval India and he himself had made a series of eclipse observations to verify the accuracy of the computational methods then in use. Based on his eclipse observations, Parameshvara proposed several corrections to the astronomical parameters which had been in use since the times of Aryabhata. The computational scheme based on the revised set of parameters has come to be known as the Drgganita or Drig system. Parameshvara was also a prolific writer on matters relating to astronomy. At least 25 manuscripts have been identified as being authored by Parameshvara. Biographical details Parameshvara was a Hindu of Bhrgugotra following the Ashvalayanasutra of the Rgveda. Parameshvara's family name (Illam) was Vatasseri and his family resided in the village of Alathiyur (Sanskritised as Asvatthagrama) in Tirur, Kerala. Alathiyur is situated on the northern bank of the river Nila (river Bharathappuzha) at its mouth in Kerala. He was a grandson of a disciple of Govinda Bhattathiri (1237‚Äì1295 CE), a legendary figure in the astrological traditions of Kerala. Parameshvara studied under teachers Rudra and Narayana, and also under Sangamagrama Madhava (c. 1350 ‚Äì c. 1425) the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. Damodara, another prominent member of the Kerala school, was his son and also his pupil. Parameshvara was also a teacher of Nilakantha Somayaji (1444‚Äì1544) the author of the celebrated Tantrasamgraha. Work Parameshvara wrote commentaries on many mathematical and astronomical works such as those by Bhaskara I and Aryabhata. He made a series of eclipse observations over a 55-year period. Constantly attempted to compare these with the theoretically computed positions of the planets. He revised planetary parameters based on his observations. One of Parameshvara's more significant contributions was his mean value type formula for the inverse interpolation of the sine.Radha Charan Gupta [1979] \\"A mean-value-type formula for inverse interpolation of the sine\\", Ganita 30 (1‚Äì2): 78‚Äî82. He was the first mathematician to give the radius of circle with an inscribed quadrilateral.Radha Charan Gupta [1977] \\"Parameshvara's rule for the circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral\\", Historia Mathematica 4: 67‚Äì74 The expression is sometimes attributed to Lhuilier [1782], 350 years later. With the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral being a, b, c, and d, the radius R of the circumscribed circle is: : R = \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac{(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)}{(- a + b + c + d)(a - b + c + d)(a + b - c + d)(a + b + c - d)}}.

With over 8,000 locations in all states except Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington, it was the second largest retailer of its type in the United States until it was acquired by Dollar Tree in 2015 and its headquarters operations were moved from Matthews, a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina, to Chesapeake, a suburb of Norfolk, Virginia. In June 2014, activist investor and major shareholder Carl Icahn demanded that Family Dollar be immediately put up for sale. On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that it would buy Family Dollar for $8.5 billion. The sale delivered a windfall to the company's biggest shareholder Carl Icahn, who acquired his 9.4 percent stake in June 2014. On January 22, 2015, Family Dollar shareholders approved the Dollar Tree bid. On March 6, 2019, the retailer announced that it will close up to 400 stores nationwide due to heavy pressure from an activist investor. History Family Dollar was founded in 1959 by Leon Levine, a 21-year-old entrepreneur. In November of that year, the company's first store was opened, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1961, their first store in South Carolina opened, followed by stores in Georgia and Virginia, which were opened in 1962 and 1965, respectively. During the 1960s, the store company was largely a southern United States operation. By 1969, there were fifty stores in Charlotte alone. The 1970s were growing years for the store chain. In 1970, Family Dollar's stock went public for the first time, at $14.50 per share. In 1971, the chain's 100th store opened, followed by their 200th in 1974 and their 300th in 1978. Also in 1974, a distribution center was opened in Matthews, North Carolina. In 1979, Family Dollar stock began trading at the New York Stock Exchange. In 1981, the chain's 400th store was opened, followed by a 500th store in 1982 and a 700th in 1983. The 1980s saw expansion at a wider scale for the company, and by 1989, 1,500 stores were operating. The 1990s saw the pace of expansion slow down compared to the 1980s, with 1,000 stores opened. The company opened distribution centers in West Memphis, Arkansas; Front Royal, Virginia and Duncan, Oklahoma. Since 2000, the pace of growth increased significantly, with the addition of about 3,500 new stores, and new distribution centers opening in Morehead, Kentucky; Maquoketa, Iowa; Odessa, Texas; Marianna, Florida; and Rome, New York. In 2001, Family Dollar joined the S&P; 500 stock market index. In 2002, the company joined the Fortune 500 list of largest publicly held companies. When Leon Levine retired in 2003, his son Howard R. Levine succeeded him as Chairman and CEO, keeping this multibillion-dollar company in the family. In March 2005, Family Dollar restated the company's fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004 earnings per share downward by 2 cents to 3 cents a year, to correct lease- accounting issues. As of August 2011, there were 7,000 stores in 44 states. According to their website in 2005, Family Dollar opened 500 new stores, 350 more in 2006, and an additional 300 in 2007. According to the Company's 2013 Corporate Profile in 2010, Family Dollar opened 200 new stores, 300 more in 2011, 475 in 2012, and an additional 500 in 2013. On October 3, 2012, Family Dollar said they will open 500 stores in 2013. The next day, Family Dollar partnered with Healthways. Family Dollar operates 11 distribution centers - the latest of which opened in St. George, Utah on October 16, 2013. The dress code for employees is a red polo shirt. Employees who choose to wear jackets while working can wear any color they please. Many employees who have light pink jackets wear them while working. Selling pressure In March 2011, Family Dollar rejected a takeover offer by Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management reportedly between $55 and $60 a share. On June 6, 2014, activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed that his firm, Icahn Enterprises, held a 9.4% stake in Family Dollar. On June 19, 2014, Icahn demanded in an open letter that Family Dollar be put up for sale immediately. Goldman Sachs and other analysts had identified a number of potential buyers. Interior of a Family Dollar in Gillette, Wyoming As of June 19, 2014, 22% of Family Dollar's shares were controlled by activist investors. =Acquisition= On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that it would acquire Family Dollar for $74.50 per share, a deal valuing Family Dollar at $8.5 billion, and that Dollar Tree would also assume $1 billion in debt currently owed by Family Dollar, for a total of $9.5 billion. Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said that Family Dollar CEO Howard R. Levine will remain with the company following the merger and will be appointed to Dollar Tree's board of directors. Dollar General entered the bidding, shortly thereafter, surpassing Dollar Tree's offer on August 18, 2014, $78.50 a share compared to Dollar Tree's offer of $74.50 a share. The enterprise value of the Dollar General bid was $9.7 billion compared to that of Dollar Tree of $9.2 billion, while the quantum return to shareholders was varying as the stock and cash deal valuation was subjected to fluctuations of price of the competing bidders stock. On August 20, 2014, Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. Days after, Dollar General CEO Rick Dreiling sent a letter to the Family Dollar board of directors claiming that Levine rejected merger requests to protect his job. Levine, in a statement, said the Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General since the start of the year, and that was the reason it was not accepting the Dollar General bid. On January 22, 2015, Family Dollar shareholders approved the Dollar Tree bid. Several stores were required to be sold as a condition of the sale. Sycamore Partners acquired the stores in 2014 under the corporate name Dollar Express. The stores continued to operate under the Family Dollar name. In 2017, Dollar General acquired Dollar Express and converted the stores. As a result of Family Dollar's sale to Dollar Tree, some Family Dollar stores have opened in the same plaza, and at times even next door to Dollar Tree locations.

He was trained by Madana S≈´ri, and was teacher to Malayendu S≈´ri. Jainism had a strong influence on mathematics particularly in the last couple of centuries BC. By the time of Mahendra Suri, however, Jainism had lost support as a national religion and was much less vigorous. He is famed as the first person to write a Sanskrit treatise on the astrolabe. Works Mahendra Suri's fame rests on the work YantrarƒÅja, which introduced the astrolabe to the Indian astronomer. Mahendra S≈´ri was patronized by the Tughlak ruler of Delhi, Fir≈´z ShƒÅh (r. 1351‚Äì1388), who evinced keen interest in astronomy. Fir≈´z ShƒÅh had earlier caused the B·πõhatsa·πÉhitƒÅ of VarƒÅhamihira to be translated into Persian. At the sultan's instance, Mahendra S≈´ri studied the astrolabe and introduced it to the Sanskrit audience in 1370 in his YantrarƒÅja. Its circulation was largely, if not wholly, confined to astronomers who worked within the Islamic and Ptolemaic traditions.The YantrarƒÅja is best described as an astrolabe user's manual. It explains how this king (rƒÅja) of instruments (yantra) is to be constructed and commissioned for purposes of observation. The saumya yantra (northern instrument) projected from the South Pole and the yƒÅmya yantra (southern instrument) projected from the North Pole are discussed separately, followed by a description of the pha·πáƒ´ndra yantra (the serpentine instrument), which combines both. A detailed discussion on the application of the astrolabe is found in Malayendu S≈´ri's commentary on the YantrarƒÅja. This commentary is also interesting because it provided, for the first time to the Indian astronomers, tables for ready reference, which helped simplify calculations. The commentator gave latitudes of 75 cities. Malayendu made a list of latitudes for 32 stars, which were identified as relevant for purposes of calculations in India.Pingree, David. (1981).

In August 2002, Jacobs left the magazine and was replaced by senior editor Allison Arieff. After Arieff, Sam Grawe held the position from 2006 to 2011, followed by Amanda Dameron from 2011 to 2017. William Hanley became the editor-in-chief in 2019. In January 2020, it was announced that Zach Klein would be taking over as Dwell's CEO. In summer 2016, the brand relaunched its digital destination as a community publishing platform, where users can create and share their own design content. In late 2016, the brand announced Modern by Dwell Magazine, a collection of over 200 products for Target. Designed by Dwell co-creative directors of product design Chris Deam and Nick Dine, the collection includes both furniture and decor pieces and will launch on December 27, 2016.

In popular culture The Tumblr blog ‚ÄúUnhappy Hipsters,‚Äù which launched in 2010, pairs photos from Dwell with humorous captions that mock the ascetic lifestyle suggested by some of the photos. The blog achieved significant popularity at the time, and its creators wrote a spinoff book in 2011, It‚Äôs Lonely in the Modern World. The magazine was mentioned in the 2012 episode ‚ÄúTallahassee‚Äù of The Office. In her memoir M Train, Patti Smith mentions leaving her copy of Dwell in a public restroom. On December 9, 2012, Dwell appeared in The Simpsons episode ‚ÄúThe Day the Earth Stood Cool,‚Äù in which Springfield undergoes a modern architectural renaissance with the arrival of a cool couple who move in next door to Homer, Marge, and company after finding the house has ‚ÄúNeutra bones.‚Äù In season 1, episode 4 of You're The Worst, Sam Dresden (played by Brandon Mychal Smith) refers to ‚ÄúBlack Dwell.‚Äù  Dwell Home Design Invitational  In January 2003, Dwell magazine invited 16 architects to participate in the Dwell Home Design Invitational, an international competition to design a modern prefab home for $200,000. The competition was conceived by Allison Arieff, after she published a book on prefab homes in 2002, titled \\"Prefab.\\" After reading Arieff's book, an entrepreneur in North Carolina, Nathan Wieler, contacted Arieff to inquire about how he and his fianc√©e, Ingrid Tung, could purchase a modern prefab home. Arieff's conversation with Wieler about a lack of affordable modern houses available inspired her to launch the competition. The site for the Dwell Home was a 12-acre plot of land that Wieler and Tung owned in Pittsboro, North Carolina, near Chapel Hill. The participating architects were: Anderson Anderson in WA and CA; Anshen + Allen in CA; Michael Bell in NY; Central Office of Architecture in CA; Claesson Koivisto Rune in Sweden; Collins + Turner Architects in Australia; Jones Partners: Architecture in CA; Adam Kalkin in NJ; Konyk Architecture in NY; Marmol + Radziner in CA; William Massie and NY; Resolution: 4 Architecture in NY; Ralph Rapson & Toby Rapson in MN; Rocio Romero in MO; Jennifer Siegal in CA; and su11 architecture+design in NY. In May 2003, the architects submitted their proposals. Then, Wieler and Tung came to Dwell's office in San Francisco to meet with Arieff and a panel of advisors to select the winning design. Judging was based on aesthetics, adherence to the budget of $200,000, construction viability, and potential for mass production. Soon after at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) in New York City, Dwell announced that Resolution: 4 Architecture (RES4) won the competition. Resolution: 4 Architecture's proposal, entitled \\"Modern Modular,\\" used prefabricated modules that were affordably built in a factory, shipped to the site, and craned onto a concrete foundation, which housed the mechanical systems. RES4's concept was that prefabricated modules could be configured in countless ways for unlimited design possibilities, though their proposal also included a home designed specifically to the clients, Wieler and Tung, and to the site. Architecturally, the 2,260-square- foot Dwell Home, composed of seven modules, reads as two intersecting bars, with the open-plan communal areas in the lower level bar and the private spaces in the second story. RES4's design used many windows and sliding glass doors for daylighting and views, and a roof deck includes an outdoor fireplace. Materials such as cedar siding, bamboo flooring, and aluminum-clad windows demonstrated the potential for customization with prefabricated construction. Carolina Building Solutions (CBS) was the factory selected to build the Dwell Home. Resolution: 4 Architecture's plan for the Dwell Home was designed within the limitations of the highway department regulations for shipping, but CBS still spent several months on engineering the Dwell Home, working within CBS's manufacturing procedures without changing RES4's original design. CBS began constructing the modules on April 6, 2004 and finished on April 13, 2004. It took only five days to build the framing and install insulation, sheathing, rough plumbing, rough electrical, nearly all of the Sheetrock, windows and trim, weatherproofing, cabinetry and stairs. On April 21, 2004, the modules were shipped from the CBS factory in Salisbury, NC to the site. By April 23, 2004, all the modules were set on the foundation. On July 10, 2004, the Dwell Home Open House expected to received about 500 visitors, but received nearly 2,500 visitors, coming from as far as Michigan, California, and Oregon. Initial construction cost estimates for the Dwell Home were about $87 per square foot, but the final cost in 2004 came in at about $110. The cost for the modules was $100,289.

Robert Lingat, The Classical Law of India, (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt Ltd, 1993), p. 20 The Baudhayana s≈´tras consist of six texts: # the , probably in 19 (questions), # the in 20 (chapters), # the in 4 , # the Grihyasutra in 4 , # the in 4 and # the in 3 .Sacred Books of the East, vol.14 ‚Äì Introduction to Baudhayana The ''''' is noted for containing several early mathematical results, including an approximation of the square root of 2 and the statement of the Pythagorean theorem. BaudhƒÅyana Shrautas≈´tra His shrauta s≈´tras related to performing Vedic sacrifices has followers in some SmƒÅrta brƒÅhma·πáas (Iyers) and some Iyengars of Tamil Nadu, Yajurvedis or Namboothiris of Kerala, Gurukkal Brahmins (Aadi Saivas), among others. The followers of this s≈´tra follow a different method and do 24 Tila-tarpa·πáa, as Lord Krishna had done tarpa·πáa on the day before amƒÅvƒÅsyƒÅ; they call themselves BaudhƒÅyana Amavasya. BaudhƒÅyana Dharmas≈´tra The Dharmas≈´tra of BaudhƒÅyana like that of Apastamba also forms a part of the larger Kalpasutra. Likewise, it is composed of pra≈õnas which literally means 'questions' or books. The structure of this Dharmas≈´tra is not very clear because it came down in an incomplete manner. Moreover, the text has undergone alterations in the form of additions and explanations over a period of time. The pra≈õnas consist of the Srautasutra and other ritual treatises, the Sulvasutra which deals with vedic geometry, and the Grhyasutra which deals with domestic rituals.Patrick Olivelle, Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), p. 127 There are no commentaries on this Dharmas≈´tra with the exception of GovindasvƒÅmin's Vivara·πáa. The date of the commentary is uncertain but according to Olivelle it is not very ancient. Also the commentary is inferior in comparison to that of Haradatta on ƒÄpastamba and Gautama.Patrick Olivelle, Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), p. xxxi This Dharmas≈´tra is divided into four books. Olivelle states that Book One and the first sixteen chapters of Book Two are the 'Proto-Baudhayana' even though this section has undergone alteration. Scholars like B√ºhler and Kane agree that the last two books of the Dharmas≈´tra are later additions. Chapter 17 and 18 in Book Two lays emphasis on various types of ascetics and acetic practices. The first book is primarily devoted to the student and deals in topics related to studentship. It also refers to social classes, the role of the king, marriage, and suspension of Vedic recitation. Book two refers to penances, inheritance, women, householder, orders of life, ancestral offerings. Book three refers to holy householders, forest hermit and penances. Book four primarily refers to the yogic practices and penances along with offenses regarding marriage.Patrick Olivelle, Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, (Oxford World Classics, 1999), pp. 128‚Äì131 BaudhƒÅyana Sulbas≈´tra =Pythagorean theorem= The BaudhƒÅyana Sulba S≈´tra states the rule referred to today in most of the world as the Pythagorean Theorem. The rule was known to a number of ancient civilizations, including also the Greek and the Chinese, and was recorded in Mesopotamia as far back as 1800 BCE. For the most part, the Sulbas≈´tra-s do not contain proofs of the rules which they describe. The rule stated in the BaudhƒÅyana Sulba S≈´tra is: > ‡§¶‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§ò‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•Å: ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ç ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡§ó‡•ç ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á > ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§¶‡•Å‡§≠‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§§‡§ø ‡•• > > dƒ´rghachatursrasyƒÅk·π£a·πáayƒÅ rajju·∏• pƒÅr≈õvamƒÅnƒ´, tiryagmƒÅnƒ´, > cha yatp·πõthagbh≈´te kurutastadubhayƒÅ·πÖ karoti. > :A rope stretched along the length of the diagonal produces an area which > the vertical and horizontal sides make together.Subhash Kak, Pythagorean > Triples and Cryptographic Coding, > https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+kak/0/1/0/all/0/1?skip=25&query;_id=a7b95a2782affe4b The diagonal and sides referred to are those of a rectangle, and the areas are those of the squares having these line segments as their sides. Since the diagonal of a rectangle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by two adjacent sides, the statement is seen to be equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem. BaudhƒÅyana also provides a statement using a rope measure of the reduced form of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle: :The cord which is stretched across a square produces an area double the size of the original square. =Circling the square= Another problem tackled by BaudhƒÅyana is that of finding a circle whose area is the same as that of a square (the reverse of squaring the circle). His s≈´tra i.58 gives this construction: :Draw half its diagonal about the centre towards the East‚ÄìWest line; then describe a circle together with a third part of that which lies outside the square. Explanation: *Draw the half-diagonal of the square, which is larger than the half-side by x = {a \\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{2}- {a \\\\over 2}. *Then draw a circle with radius {a \\\\over 2} + {x \\\\over 3}, or {a \\\\over 2} + {a \\\\over 6}(\\\\sqrt{2}-1), which equals {a \\\\over 6}(2 + \\\\sqrt{2}). * Now (2+\\\\sqrt{2})^2 \\\\approx 11.66 \\\\approx {36.6\\\\over \\\\pi}, so the area {\\\\pi}r^2 \\\\approx \\\\pi \\\\times {a^2 \\\\over 6^2} \\\\times {36.6\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\approx a^2. =Square root of 2= BaudhƒÅyana i.61-2 (elaborated in ƒÄpastamba Sulbas≈´tra i.6) gives the length of the diagonal of a square in terms of its sides, which is equivalent to a formula for the square root of 2: :samasya dvikara·πáƒ´. pramƒÅ·πáa·πÉ t·πõtƒ´yena vardhayet tac caturthenƒÅtmacatustri·πÉ≈õonena savi≈õe·π£a·∏• : The diagonal [lit. \\"doubler\\"] of a square. The measure is to be increased by a third and by a fourth decreased by the 34th. That is its diagonal approximately. That is, :\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3 \\\\cdot 4} - \\\\frac{1}{3 \\\\cdot4 \\\\cdot 34} = \\\\frac{577}{408} \\\\approx 1.414216, which is correct to five decimals.O'Connor, \\"Baudhayana\\". Other theorems include: diagonals of rectangle bisect each other, diagonals of rhombus bisect at right angles, area of a square formed by joining the middle points of a square is half of original, the midpoints of a rectangle joined forms a rhombus whose area is half the rectangle, etc. Note the emphasis on rectangles and squares; this arises from the need to specify yaj√±a bh≈´mikƒÅs‚Äîi.e. the altar on which a rituals were conducted, including fire offerings (yaj√±a). This is an aspect of Vaastu Shastras and Shilpa Shastras. These theorems are derived from those texts.

Landscape: Ellen Biddle Shipman, from 1922. David Hanlon, gardener. Fitzhugh and his wife, Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh (1747‚Äì1805), built Chatham Manor on property across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg, Virginia and completed it in 1771 after three years of construction. It still stands today as the National Park Service Headquarters for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. The Fitzhughs lived a lavish life there that included experimental farming and horse racing. After the Revolutionary War, as the economy floundered, Fitzhugh sold Chatham Manor and 1,288 acres (5.2 km2) to Churchill Jones for $20,000. About 1799, William Fitzhugh bought the house at 607 Oronoco Street, Alexandria, Virginia, which has become known as \\"The Boyhood Home of Robert E. Lee.\\" The house ad been built in 1795 by John Potts, Jr. After William Fitzhugh's death, it then passed to William Henry Fitzhugh, his only son, and was rented to the Lee family. Fitzhugh had built another mansion, Ravensworth, in 1796, where North Springfield, Virginia, is now located. It was his country home, with the Alexandria one being his townhouse. Ravensworth stood until about 1925, when it burned under mysterious circumstances.http://braddockheritage.org/content/vault/Stuntz_Mayo_c092fa2e92.pdf William Fitzhugh and George Washington visited each other frequently until Washington's death in 1799.

When that assembly was dissolved by Virginia colonial governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, Fitzhugh continued to serve King George County, Virginia in ad hoc conventions held in Williamsburg and Richmond. He was also a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Safety in 1774-75. During the American Revolutionary War he was a commissioner of two arms and munitions factories. He served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1776 to 1777.

Biography Oppian states that he is from 'the city of Hermes' and the 'city at the promontory of Sarpedon'.Halieutica 3.9, 3.205-209 This has been supplemented by information from the biographies attached to medieval manuscripts, which state that his birthplace was Caesarea (now known as Anazarbus) or Corycus in Cilicia.,Mair, A.W. 1928. Oppian, Colluthus, Tryphiodorus., Loeb Classical Liberary, Cambridge (MA), xiii-xv. or Corycus according to the Suda. All these cities were in the Roman province of Cilicia. He composed a didactic poem in Greek hexameter on fishing (, Halieutik√°). It is about 3500 lines and bears a dedication to Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus, placing it to the time of their joint rule (176-180 AD). A later didactic poem on hunting, the Cynegetica (, Kynƒìgetik√°), was also attributed to Oppian. For that reason, its anonymous poet is generally referred to as Pseudo-Oppian or Oppian of Apamea.The most comprehensive study that proves that the Cynegetica is not by Oppian is Mart√≠nez, S. and Silva, T. 2003. 'Opiano, ¬øun poeta o dos?', L'Antiquit√© Classique 72, 219-230 Furthermore, a didactic poem on bird catching, Ixeutica (, Ixeutik√°), which now only survives in a prose paraphrase, was also attributed to Oppian in the manuscript tradition. The Ixeutica is now thought to describe a work composed by the Dionysus whom the Suda mention as the author of a treatise on rocks (, Lithiak√°). A likely explanation for the attribution of all these works to Oppian is that the three didactic poems on hunting, fishing, and fowling were at some point circulated as a complementary trio.Keydell, R. 1937. Oppianos (2), in: von Pauly, A.F. et al. (eds), Paulys Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. Stuttgart, vol. 18, 703-708, p.703-704; James, A.W. 1970. Studies in the Language of Oppian of Cilicia, Amsterdam, p. 2 According to the anonymous biographies attached to the Byzantine manuscripts of the Halieutica, Oppian's father, having incurred the displeasure of a colleague of Marcus Aurelius named Lucius Verus by neglecting to pay his respects to him when he visited Rome, was banished to Malta. Oppian, who had accompanied his father into exile, returned after the death of Verus and presented his poems to Marcus Aurelius, who was so pleased with them that he gave the author a piece of gold for each line, took him into favor, and pardoned his father. Oppian subsequently returned to his native country but died of the plague shortly afterwards at the early age of thirty. His contemporaries erected a statue in his honor, with an inscription which is still extant, containing a lament for his premature death and a eulogy of his precocious genius. The Halieutica The Halieutica consists of five books, which can be divided into two parts: books 1-2 describe the behaviour of fish and other marine animals, books 3-5 contain various fishing techniques. The content of the Halieutica is not sufficient to serve as a practical guide for fishing. Instead, the humans and animals described in the work often seem to provide examples of good and bad behaviour. The fish in the Halieutica are depicted in an anthropomorphic fashion, as their behaviour is generally motivated by emotions such as hate, love, greed, jealousy and friendship. The fish are also very frequently the subject of Homeric similes. In many cases, Oppian reverses the Homeric technique: where Homer compares epic heroes with animals, the actions of animals in the Halieutica are often compared to all types of human behaviour.See for instance Kneebone, E. 2008. \\"'Œ§ŒüŒ£Œ£' ŒïŒîŒëŒóŒù: The Poetics of Knowledge in Oppian's Halieutica\\", Ramus 37.1-2, 32-59; Bartley, A.N. 2003.

Untersuchungen zur Typologie des antiken Lehrgedichts. M√ºnchen, p. 137-153 The content of the Halieutica is as follows: * Book 1: after the introduction and dedication of the work to Marcus Aurelius, the first half of the work contains a catalogue of marine animal species, sorted by their habitat (Hal. 1.80-445). The second half describes their reproductive behaviour (Hal. 1.446-797). * Book 2: this book describes the 'battles' of fish, how predators catch their prey and techniques that fish use to avoid capture by other fish. * Book 3: the book starts with a description of the preparations for fishing (Hal. 3.29-91). It then describes how fish escape fishermen (Hal. 3.92-168). The main portion of the book contains various techniques to capture fish through their gluttony (Hal. 3.169-528), followed by a list of fish that can be caught due to their aggression and ends with tuna fishing (Hal. 3.529-648). * Book 4: the main theme of this book is fishing through manipulating the love and lust of fish (Hal. 4.1-449). The remainder of the book describes, among other things, frightening fish (Hal. 4.502-634) and fishing with poison (Hal. 4.647-693). * Book 5: in many ways grand finale of the Halieutica, as it teaches you how to catch the largest animals of the sea, including whales, sharks, and dolphins. The work is concluded by a section on the fatal outcome of sponge diving.

The term Middle Stone Age is used as an equivalent or a synonym for the Middle Paleolithic in African archeology. The Middle Paleolithic broadly spanned from 300,000 to 30,000 years ago. There are considerable dating differences between regions. The Middle Paleolithic was succeeded by the Upper Paleolithic subdivision which first began between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago. Pettit and White date the Early Middle Paleolithic in Great Britain to about 325,000 to 180,000 years ago (late Marine Isotope Stage 9 to late Marine Isotope Stage 7), and the Late Middle Paleolithic as about 60,000 to 35,000 years ago. According to the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans, anatomically modern humans began migrating out of Africa during the Middle Stone Age/Middle Paleolithic around 125,000 years ago and began to replace earlier pre-existent Homo species such as the Neanderthals and Homo erectus. Origin of behavioral modernity The earliest evidence of behavioral modernity first appears during the Middle Paleolithic; undisputed evidence of behavioral modernity, however, only becomes common during the following Upper Paleolithic period. Middle Paleolithic burials at sites such as Krapina in Croatia (dated to 130,000 BP) and the Qafzeh and Es Skhul caves in Israel ( 100,000 BP) have led some anthropologists and archeologists (such as Philip Lieberman) to believe that Middle Paleolithic cultures may have possessed a developing religious ideology which included concepts such as an afterlife; other scholars suggest the bodies were buried for secular reasons. According to recent archeological findings from Homo heidelbergensis sites in the Atapuerca Mountains, the practice of intentional burial may have begun much earlier during the late Lower Paleolithic, but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community. Cut-marks on Neandertal bones from various sites - such as Combe Grenal and the Moula rock shelter in France - may imply that Neanderthals, like some contemporary human cultures, may have practiced excarnation for presumably religious reasons (see Neanderthal behavior ¬ß Cannibalism or ritual defleshing?). The earliest undisputed evidence of artistic expression during the Paleolithic period comes from Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos Cave in the form of bracelets, beads, art rock, ochre used as body paint and perhaps in ritual, though earlier examples of artistic expression such as the Venus of Tan-Tan and the patterns found on elephant bones from Bilzingsleben in Thuringia may have been produced by Acheulean tool-users such as Homo erectus prior to the start of the Middle Paleolithic period.\\"Human Evolution\\", Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. Microsoft Corporation. Contributed by Richard B. Potts. Archived 2009-11-01. Activities such as catching large fish and hunting large game animals with specialized tools indicate increased group-wide cooperation and more elaborate social organization. In addition to developing advanced cultural traits, humans also first began to take part in long- distance trade between groups for rare commodities (such as ochre (which was often used for religious purposes such as ritual; )) and raw materials during the Middle Paleolithic as early as 120,000 years ago. Inter-group trade may have appeared during the Middle Paleolithic because trade between bands would have helped ensure their survival by allowing them to exchange resources and commodities such as raw materials during times of relative scarcity (i.e., famine or drought). Social stratification Evidence from archeology and comparative ethnography indicates that Middle Paleolithic people lived in small, egalitarian band societies similar to those of Upper Paleolithic societies and some modern hunter-gatherers such as the «ÉKung and Mbuti peoples., p. 198 Both Neandertal and modern human societies took care of the elderly members of their societies during the Middle Paleolithic. Christopher Boehm (1999) has hypothesized that egalitarianism may have arisen in Middle Paleolithic societies because of a need to distribute resources such as food and meat equally to avoid famine and ensure a stable food supply., p. 192 Typically, it has been assumed that women gathered plants and firewood and men hunted and scavenged dead animals through the Paleolithic. However, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that this sex-based division of labor (presumably) did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic in Middle Paleolithic societies (modern humans before 40,000 or 50,000 BCE and Neandertals) and evolved relatively recently in human prehistory. The sexual division of labor may have evolved to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently and thus may have allowed Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens to out-compete the Neandertals in Europe. Nutrition Although gathering and hunting comprised most of the food supply during the Middle Paleolithic, people began to supplement their diet with seafood and began smoking and drying meat to preserve and store it. For instance the Middle Stone Age inhabitants of the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago,\\"Human Evolution,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 Contributed by Richard B. Potts. and Neandertals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neandertal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens sites at Pinnacle Point, in Africa. Anthropologists such as Tim D. White suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, based on the large amount of ‚Äúbutchered human\\" bones found in Neandertal and other Middle Paleolithic sites. Cannibalism in the Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages. However it is also possible that Middle Paleolithic cannibalism occurred for religious reasons which would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the Upper Paleolithic. Nonetheless it remains possible that Middle Paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of excarnation or predation by carnivores such as saber- toothed cats, lions and hyenas. Technology This is a drawing of a replica of an Acheulean hand-axe found during the Lower Paleolithic period. The raw material this tool is made of in this drawing is black obsidian and is even worked on both sides. Around 200,000 BP Middle Paleolithic Stone tool manufacturing spawned a tool-making technique known as the prepared-core technique, that was more elaborate than previous Acheulean techniques.\\"Human Evolution,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. Microsoft Corporation. Contributed by Richard B. Potts. Archived 2009-11-01. Wallace and Shea split the core artifacts into two different types: formal cores and expedient cores. Formal cores are designed to extract the maximum amount from the raw material while expedient cores are more based on function need. This method increased efficiency by permitting the creation of more controlled and consistent flakes. This method allowed Middle Paleolithic humans correspondingly to create stone-tipped spears, which were the earliest composite tools, by hafting sharp, pointy stone flakes onto wooden shafts. Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals who possessed a Middle Paleolithic level of technology appear to have hunted large game just as well as Upper Paleolithic modern humans and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons. Nonetheless Neanderthal usage of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely (or perhaps never) and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with m√™l√©e weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons. An ongoing controversy about the nature of Middle Paleolithic tools is whether there were a series of functionally specific and preconceived tool forms or whether there was a simple continuum of tool morphology that reflect the extent of edge maintenance, as Harold L. Dibble has suggested. The use of fire became widespread for the first time in human prehistory during the Middle Paleolithic and humans began to cook their food c. 250,000 years ago. Some scientists have hypothesized that hominids began cooking food to defrost frozen meat which would help ensure their survival in cold regions. Robert K. Wayne, a molecular biologist, has controversially claimed, based on a comparison of canine DNA, that dogs may have been first domesticated during the Middle Paleolithic around or even before 100,000 BCE.

He is the Rhythm Guitarist, keyboardist and co-vocalist for the band Busted and the lead singer and the Rhythm guitarist for the band Son of Dork. He is also co-founder of Pop Punk bands Busted and Son of Dork as well as a solo electronic project, Future Boy. From 2013-2015 he was a member of McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly. Personal life Bourne was born in Rochford, Essex to Peter and Maria Bourne and moved to Southend-on-Sea at age ten months. He has a sister named Melissa and two brothers named Nick and Chris. Bourne attended the independent fee-paying Thorpe Hall School in Southend-on-Sea. Bourne plays electric guitar, piano, drums and bass guitar. Bourne claims that he is still good friends with Matt Willis and on good terms with Charlie Simpson and have since reformed, releasing two new albums. He also has a good relationship with the band members of McFly. Bourne owns an American skating and apparel company called SicPuppy, named after a band he was once a member of. Bourne paid over ¬£16,000 for his own record company, Sicpuppy Records, which, in 2007, gave unsigned UK bands a chance to play on the Sic Tour 2007 in Shepherd's Bush Empire. The event was hosted by David Gest and Matt Willis. Bourne attended Morgan Academy of Performing Arts, based in Essex. Music career =Busted= At the age of 17, Bourne dropped out of the South East Essex college course in Music Technology to pursue his music career. He met Matt Willis at a gig and they started writing songs together at Bourne's house in Southend. Willis and Bourne placed an ad for a third band member in NME magazine. They held auditions and after listening to a few songs the two had written together, Charlie Simpson joined the band. After signing to Universal in 2002, Busted released their first single, \\"What I Go To School For\\", from their self-titled debut album in September that year, which quickly became No. 3 in the UK charts. \\"Year 3000\\" soon followed and became a hit as well reaching No. 2 in the charts, their third single \\"You Said No\\" was a No. 1 hit. By the end of the band's career, they had managed eight top 10 singles and four number ones ‚Äì \\"You Said No\\", \\"Crashed the Wedding\\", \\"Who's David?\\" and \\"Thunderbirds Are Go\\". Despite their success, Busted split on 14 January 2005 after just three years, following Simpson's decision to leave the band to concentrate on his side project Fightstar. In October 2015, rumours spread in various British tabloids that Busted were reuniting once again. The following month, images emerged showing a silhouetted band with a caption suggesting a Busted press conference. On 10 November 2015 Busted announced their return as a band, featuring Simpson again. They also announced a 2016 nationwide tour, Pigs Can Fly Tour 2016. Their third album, Night Driver, was released on 25 November 2016. Their fourth studio album and subsequent tour took place in 2019, Half Way There has also been a hit for the band. =Son of Dork= After Busted split in January 2005, Bourne formed a new pop rock band named Son of Dork. They released their first single, \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\" in November 2005 followed by their debut album, Welcome to Loserville, two weeks later. Although a split was never officially announced, Dave Williams, Chris Leonard and Steve Rushton all left to pursue other projects leaving Bourne and Danny Hall the only members. With that, the second album was cancelled. A reunion of sorts happened on occasion as Bourne turned their debut album into Loserville: The Musical. Danny Hall and James Bourne both performed \\"Holly... I'm The One\\" together at the Oliver Awards. =Future Boy= Following the split of Son of Dork, Bourne pursued a musical career as a solo artist under the name Future Boy inspired by his favourite movie Back to the Future. In June 2009, Bourne announced that he had begun recording his debut solo album; \\"not a rock album. It is 100% electronic.\\" Volume 1 was produced and mixed by Tommy Henriksen and Bourne at Henriksen's Anarchy Studio's in Nashville and Los Angeles. Side A of Volume 1 was released on 3 May 2010; the album was released via his official website and not a record label. Side B would be released on 3 June. Side B featured a further five songs, including a ballad with his then girlfriend Gabriela Arciero. As part of Valentine's Day, Future Boy posted a new track on Facebook called \\"Dangerous\\"; the song didn't make the final cut for Volume 1. Although Volume 2 was officially announced in February 2011 for a 3 May 2012 release as a Facebook video game Space Travellers, the album has yet to surface due to technical difficulties and other commitments. =Solo projects= Alongside his alter ego act Future Boy, Bourne revealed on Kali FM that he would be releasing a solo EP and aired some songs on the radio show. The EP is set to be released in the summer. Songs including \\"Gone\\" & \\"One of A Kind\\", were played on air. Bourne revealed it would in fact be a solo album and will include the track \\"Beautiful Girls are the Loneliest\\". In 2012, Bourne did his debut solo acoustic tour across the Uk. Dates included London, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Islingon and Birmingham, with Matt Willis and wife, Emma Willis, as well as family members coming to support him. His set consisted of a mixture of songs from Busted, Future Boy and Son of Dork. He went on to do a brief tour in Spain. On 31 December 2019, Bourne announced a new solo project but reassured Busted fans that the band was not splitting-up, tweeting \\"After twenty amazing years making music, I am stepping into 2020 on a brand new solo adventure. Busted will always be my band. But, I‚Äôve dreamed for years about releasing my own album so here we go.\\" =McBusted= In 2013, Bourne supported for McFly, which was later referred to by the newly formed McBusted as the starting point for ideas of McFly and Busted joining together as a contribution to the McFly tour, which then later sparked ideas of their own McBusted tour. The McBusted tour was a success and the tour was extended from 11 dates to 36 dates. McBusted released their self-titled debut album on 1 December 2014, with a large portion of the tracks written/co-written by Bourne. Some tracks on the album were from some of Bourne's previous musical projects like \\"What Happened To Your Band\\" that was originally written for Son of Dork and \\"Beautiful Girls Are The Loneliest\\" which was intended for his solo project. McBusted went on a 21 date tour in 2015 and performed songs from their new album as well as previous McFly and Busted hits. =Other projects= In February 2009, Bourne formed the band Call Me When I'm 18 with Ollie Kinski. The band was meant as a successor to Busted and Son of Dork. The pair released four songs to the public including a cover of the previously unreleased Son of Dork song \\"Go Home Monday\\". The others were \\"Dumbstruck\\", \\"Break It\\" and \\"Gone\\". They disbanded in 2011 and Bourne instead decided to continue with his solo project. In early 2013, Bourne formed a band with his brother Chris Bourne called The Bourne Insanity. They released their first single \\"Mohawk\\" on 16 April, unsigned and written solely by Chris. In late 2013, Bourne announced via Twitter that he had posted \\"secret\\" music under a different name on iTunes. The band was later revealed to be \\"88\\", which was Bourne and fellow musician Eric Bazilian. 88 released their first single, \\"Angels Walk Beside You\\", on 5 December 2013, and on 8 February 2014 they released their second single \\"Miss the Girl\\". Songwriting Bourne performing in 2016 Bourne wrote the majority of Busted's two albums with Matt Willis, Charlie Simpson and Tom Fletcher (McFly). Busted's style of music can also be identified in songs with his next band Son of Dork's poppier tracks. Bourne has co-writing credits on the first four McFly albums - Room on the 3rd Floor, Wonderland, Motion in the Ocean and Radio:Active, contributing to the majority of the tracks on the former. He takes a lot of writing credits for artists such as Melanie C for whom he wrote \\"Immune\\" for her fourth studio album This Time. Other artists include MC Lars, with whom he wrote the song \\"Twenty-three\\" on the This Gigantic Robot Kills album, and Pat Monahan, with whom he co-wrote \\"Great Escape\\" on the album Last of Seven. Bourne has recently been writing with his girlfriend's band The Lunabelles and JC Chasez as well as unknown artists as a part of Metrophonic. He has also helped write songs for the British drama Britannia High. He also wrote Eoghan Quigg's debut solo single \\"28,000 Friends\\", which was originally performed by Bourne at The Living Room, New York on 11 October 2007. He also co-wrote The Saturdays song, \\"Forever Is Over\\", which was released on 2 October and reached number two in the charts. In November 2009, Bourne collaborated with Leon G. Thomas III to write the song \\"Please Don't Change Your Mind\\". Bourne's music often includes references to films. For example, Busted's song \\"Year 3000\\" contains several references to Back to the Future as well as Son of Dork's song \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\" containing the lyrics \\"Wake up to 'I Got You Babe', Like the guy from Groundhog Day\\". In 2014, Bourne was writing songs for supergroup McBusted, The Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer. This includes the song Daylight by 5 Seconds of Summer which was cowritten with his brother Chris Bourne. Musical theatre =Loserville: The Musical= In February 2009, Youth Music Theatre UK commissioned Bourne, along with his friend Elliot Davis, to write a musical based on the Son of Dork album Welcome to Loserville, Loserville: The Musical. The tickets for the 20 August premiere went up for sale on 7 May. The slogan used for the musical is \\"I guess it really pays to be a slacker...\\", and is centred around 17-year-old Michael Dork, who is called a nerd, geek and slacker by others. Bourne tweeted that the musical would be hitting London's West End in 2011; however, it eventually opened on 1 October 2012 at the Garrick Theatre. From 18 June 2012 to 14 July 2012 the musical ran in Leeds at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. The show opened at the Garrick Theatre on 17 October 2012, following previews from 1 October officially beginning its tour on the West End. The production was originally set to run until 2 March 2013, but closed early on 5 January 2013. The production included past Son of Dork band member Danny Hall on drums and singer Lil' Chris. =Out There: The Musical= In 2011, Youth Music Theatre once again commissioned Bourne and Davis to write a new, original musical called Out There. First presented as a workshop presentation in a small theatre west of London, the musical is set in the fictional town of Hope, Texas, and follows the story of Logan Carter, who is on the run from his home town near Detroit after committing a minor felony. Hope is a dead-end, one- horse town (even the horse has died) and its inhabitants are searching for ways to rescue the town from obscurity and financial ruin. Meanwhile, a few miles away in the desert, an old man is building something weird in his outhouse. In July 2012, the original Youth Music Theatre cast and crew reunited to put on several performances at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London, with new songs added. Prior to this, a funding page was set up to allow them to perform and although they didn't reach their $15,000 goal they still went ahead with the shows. The musical is available to have amateur and professional performances in schools and the stage through the Josef Weinbeger LTD. =Murder at the Gates= In 2013, Bourne announced another musical he had been working on, Murder at the Gates. This time, the musical sees Bourne working with Spring Awakening writer Steven Sater, who has penned with book & lyrics for this musical whereas Bourne worked solely on the music score. The musical had a trial run performance of three shows in New York under NYU in September 2013 using NYU students. Murder at the Gates is set in a posh gated community in a manor where a costume birthday party is being held for a murder mystery play but the play becomes her life.

The Liberator was never issued to American or other Allied troops, and there are few documented instances of the weapon being used for its intended purpose; though the intended recipients, irregulars and resistance fighters, rarely kept detailed records due to the inherent risks if the records were captured by the enemy. Few FP-45 pistols were distributed as intended, and most were destroyed by Allied forces after the war. Project history The concept was suggested by a Polish military attach√© in March 1942. The project was assigned to the US Army Joint Psychological Warfare Committee and was designed for the United States Army two months later by George Hyde of the Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation in Dayton, Ohio. Production was undertaken by General Motors Guide Lamp Division to avoid conflicting priorities with Inland Division production of the M1 carbine. The army designated the weapon the Flare Projector Caliber .45 hence the designation FP-45. This was done to disguise the fact that a pistol was being mass- produced. The original engineering drawings labeled the barrel as \\"tube\\", the trigger as \\"yoke\\", the firing pin as \\"control rod\\", and the trigger guard as \\"spanner\\". The Guide Lamp Division plant in Anderson, Indiana assembled a million of these guns. The Liberator project took about six months from conception to the end of production with about 11 weeks of actual manufacturing time, done by 300 workers. Design The operating instructions distributed with the FP-45 The FP-45 was a crude, single-shot pistol designed to be cheaply and quickly mass-produced. It had just 23 largely stamped and turned steel parts that were cheap and easy to manufacture. It fired the .45 ACP pistol cartridge from an unrifled barrel. Due to this limitation, it was intended for short range use, . Its maximum effective range was only about . At longer range, the bullet would begin to tumble and stray off course. The original delivered cost for the FP-45 was $2.10/unit, lending it the nickname \\"Woolworth pistol\\". Five extra rounds of ammunition could be stored in the pistol grip. Wartime use The Liberator was shipped in a cardboard box with 10 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition, a wooden dowel to remove the empty cartridge case, and an instruction sheet in comic strip form showing how to load and fire the weapon. The Liberator was a crude and clumsy weapon, never intended for front line service. It was originally intended as an insurgency weapon to be mass dropped behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory. A resistance fighter was to recover the gun, sneak up on an Axis occupier, kill or incapacitate him, and retrieve his weapons. It was manufactured under the \\"FP\\" prefix and referred to in official documentation as a \\"Flare pistol\\". The pistol was valued as much for its psychological warfare effect as its actual field performance. It was believed that if vast quantities of these handguns could be delivered into Axis-occupied territory, it would have a devastating effect on the morale of occupying troops. The plan was to drop it in such great quantities that occupying forces could never capture or recover all of them. It was hoped that the thought of thousands of these unrecovered weapons potentially in the hands of the citizens of occupied countries would have a deleterious effect on enemy morale.Wolfgang Michel: Die Liberator Pistole FP-45: Partisanenwaffe und Instrument der psychologischen Kriegsf√ºhrung. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff never saw the practicality in mass dropping the Liberator over occupied Europe, and authorized distribution of fewer than 25,000 of the half million FP-45 pistols shipped to Great Britain for the French resistance. Generals Joseph Stilwell and Douglas MacArthur were similarly unenthusiastic about the other half of the pistols scheduled for shipment to the Pacific. The Army then turned 450,000 Liberators over to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which preferred to supply Resistance fighters in both theatres with more effective weapons whenever possible. French use of the FP-45 remains undocumented, however a first hand account of an assassination with an FP-45 exists from German military policeman Niklaus Lange. He claimed that there were thousands in circulation in occupied France. The OSS did distribute a few to Greek resistance forces in 1944. Most of the pistols shipped to Britain were undistributed, and later dumped at sea or melted for scrap metal. One hundred thousand FP-45 pistols were shipped to China in 1943, but the number actually distributed remains unknown. A few were distributed to the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary, and resistance fighters.

Its wingspan was similar to that of a modern Boeing 747, and was not exceeded until the 64.6 metre wingspan Douglas XB-19 heavy bomber prototype first flew in 1941.  Overview  The ANT-20 was designed by Andrei Tupolev, using German engineer Hugo Junkers' original all-metal aircraft design techniques from 1918. It was constructed between 4 July 1933 and 3 April 1934, and was one of two aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maksim Gorki and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers aviation firm's design philosophy of corrugated sheet metal for many of the airframe's key components, especially the corrugated sheet metal skinning of the airframe. It was intended for Stalinist propaganda purposes and was equipped with a powerful radio set known as the \\"Voice from the sky\\" (\\"–ì–æ–ª–æ—Å —Å –Ω–µ–±–∞\\", Golos s neba), printing machinery, a library, radio broadcasting equipment, a photographic laboratory and a film projector with sound for showing films in flight. In a first in aviation the aircraft was equipped with a ladder which would fold on itself to become part of the floor. The aircraft was the first to use both direct current and alternating current. The aircraft could be dismantled and transported by rail if needed. The aircraft set several carrying-capacity world records and is also the subject of a 1934 painting by Vasily Kuptsov, which is now in the collection of the Russian Museum at Saint Petersburg.  1935 Maksim Gorky crash  Vasily Kuptsov, Maksim Gorky ANT-20 (1934), Russian Museum, St. Petersburg On 18 May 1935, the Maksim Gorky (pilots ‚Äì I. V. Mikheyev and I. S. Zhurov) and three more aircraft (a Tupolev ANT-14, R-5 and I-5) took off for a demonstration flight over Moscow. The main purpose of the other three aircraft flying so close was to make evident the difference in size. The accompanying I-5 fighter piloted by Nikolai Blagin had performed two loop manoeuvres around the Maksim Gorky. On the third loop, they collided. The Maksim Gorky crashed into a low-rise residential neighbourhood west of present-day Sokol metro station. Forty-five people were killed in the crash, including the fighter pilot as well as both crew members and the 33 passengers on the Maksim Gorky, and an additional nine people on the ground.  ANT-20bis  Aeroflot's ANT-20bis A replacement aircraft, designated ANT-20bis had begun production the following year and first flew in 1938. It was largely identical in design but with six more-powerful Mikulin AM-34FRNV engines. In December 1940, the aircraft was re-engined with two slightly more powerful Mikulin AM-35 engines in the inner positions (numbers three and four). This aircraft, designated PS-124 and registered CCCP-L760, served with Aeroflot on transport routes in Russia and Uzbekistan. On 14 December 1942, it crashed after the pilot allowed a passenger to take his seat momentarily and the passenger apparently disengaged the automatic pilot, sending the airplane into a nosedive from an altitude of , killing all 36 on board.

Antisense RNA (asRNA), also referred to as antisense transcript, natural antisense transcript (NAT) or antisense oligonucleotide, is a single stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding messenger RNA (mRNA) with which it hybridizes, and thereby blocks its translation into protein. asRNAs (which occur naturally) have been found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense transcripts can be classified into short (<200 nucleotides) and long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression. asRNAs may also be produced synthetically and have found wide spread use as research tools for gene knockdown. They may also have therapeutic applications.  Discovery and history in drug development  Some of the earliest asRNAs were discovered while investigating functional proteins. An example was micF asRNA. While characterizing the outer membrane porin in E.coli, some of the promoter clones observed were capable of repressing the expression of other membrane porin such as . The region responsible for this repression function was found to be a 300 base-pair locus upstream of the promoter. This 300 base-pair region is 70% homologous in sequence with the 5' end of the mRNA and thus the transcript of this 300 base pair locus was complementary to the mRNA. Later on, this transcript, denoted micF, was found to be an asRNA of and capable of downregulating the expression of under stress by forming a duplex with the mRNA. This induces the degradation of the mRNA. Unlike micF RNA being discovered by accident, the majority of asRNAs were discovered by genome wide searches for small regulatory RNAs and by transcriptome analysis. Conventionally, the first step involves computational predictions based on some known characteristics of asRNAs. During computational searches, the encoding regions are excluded. The regions that are predicted to have conserved RNA structures and act as orphan promoters and Rho independent terminators are preferenced during analysis. Because computational searches focuses on the intergenic region, the asRNAs that are transcribed from the opposite strand of an encoding gene are likely to be missed using this method. To detect asRNA transcribed from the encoding region, oligonucleotide microarrays can be used. In this method, one or both strands of encoding genes can be used as probes. In addition to computational searches and microarrays, some asRNAs were discovered by sequencing cDNA clones as well as mapping promoter elements. Although many findings from the approaches mentioned above gave rise to a lot of possible asRNAs, only few were proven to be actual asRNAs via further functional tests. To minimize the number of false positive results, new approaches from recent years have been focusing on strand- specific transcription, chromatin binding noncoding RNAs and single cell studies. The idea of asRNAs as drug targets started in 1978 when Zamecnik and Stephenson found an antisense oligonucleotide to the viral RNA of Rous scarcoma virus that was capable of inhibiting viral replication and protein synthesis. Since then, much effort has been devoted to developing asRNAs as drug candidates. In 1998, the first asRNA drug, fomivirsen, was approved by FDA. Fomivirsen, a 21 base-pair oligonucleotide, was developed to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS. It works by targeting the transcribed mRNA of the virus and consequently inhibiting replication of cytomegalovirus. Despite fomivirsen was discontinued in 2004 due to the loss of the market, it served as a successful and inspiring example of using asRNAs as drug targets or drug candidates. Another example of using an asRNA as a therapeutic agent is mipomersen, which was approved by FDA in 2013. Mipomersen was developed to manage the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), which is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition. Because of the high level of total cholesterol (650‚Äì1000 mg/dL) and LDL receptor (above 600 mg/dL) in HoFH, patients with HoFH has a high risk for coronary heart disease. Because the protein apo-B-100 has been found to be required to produce very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL, mipomersen complements with the mRNA of apo-B-100 and target it for RNAse H dependent degradation. Ultimately, mipomersen is able to reduce the level of LDL.  Examples across species  The initial asRNAs discovered were in prokaryotes including plasmids, bacteriophage and bacteria. For example, in plasmid ColE1, the asRNA termed RNA I plays an important role in determining the plasmid copy number by controlling replication. The replication of ColE1 relies on the transcription of a primer RNA named RNA II. Once RNA II is transcribed, it hybridizes to its DNA template and later cleaved by RNase H. In the presence of the asRNA RNA I, RNA I and RNA II forms a duplex which introduces a conformational change of RNA II. Consequently, RNA II cannot hybridize with its DNA template which results in a low copy number of ColE1. In bacteriophage P22, the asRNA sar helps regulate between lytic and lysogenic cycle by control the expression of Ant. Besides being expressed in prokaryotes, asRNAs were also discovered in plants. The most well described example of asRNA regulation in plants is on Flowering Locus C (FLC) gene. FLC gene in Arabidopsis thaliana encodes for a transcription factor that prevent expression of a range of genes that induce floral transition. In cold environment, the asRNA of FLC gene, denoted COOLAIR, is expressed and inhibits the expression of FLC via chromatin modification which consequently allows for flowering. In mammalian cells, a typical example of asRNA regulation is X chromosome inactivation. Xist, an asRNA, can recruit polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which results in heterochromatinization of the X chromosome.  Classification  Antisense RNAs can be classified in different ways. In terms of regulatory mechanisms, some author group asRNAs into RNA-DNA interactions, RNA-RNA interactions either in nucleus or cytoplasm and RNA-protein interactions (epigenetic). Antisense RNAs can be categorized by the type of the promoters that initiate expression of asRNAs: independent promoters, shared bidirectional promoters or cryptic promoters. In terms of length, although asRNA in general is classified under lncRNAs, there are short asRNAs with length of less than 200 base pairs. Because the regulatory mechanism of asRNAs are found to be species specific, asRNAs can also be classified by species. One of the common ways of classifying asRNAs is by where the asRNAs are transcribe relatively to their target genes: cis-acting and trans-acting. = Cis-acting = Cis-acting asRNAs are transcribed from the opposite strand of the target gene at the target gene locus. They often show high degree or complete complementarity with the target gene. If the cis-acting asRNA regulates gene expression by targeting mRNA, it can only target individual mRNA. Upon interactions with the targeting mRNAs, cis-acting asRNAs can either block ribosome binding or recruit RNAase to degrade the targeting mRNAs. Consequently, the function of these cis-acting asRNAs is to repress translation of the targeting mRNAs. Besides cis-acting asRNAs that target mRNAs, there are cis-acting epigenetic silencers and activators. In terms of epigenetic modification, cis-acting refers to the nature of these asRNAs that regulate epigenetic changes around the loci where they are transcribed. Instead of targeting individual mRNAs, these cis-acting epigenetic regulators can recruit chromatin modifying enzymes which can exert effects on both the transcription loci and the neighboring genes. = Trans-acting = Trans-acting asRNAs are transcribed from loci that are distal from the targeting genes. In contrast to cis-acting asRNAs, they display low degree of complementarity with the target gene but can be longer than cis-acting asRNAs. They can also target multiple loci. Because of these properties of trans-acting asRNAs, they form less stable complexes with their targeting transcripts and sometimes require aids from RNA chaperone protein such as Hfq to exert their functions. Due to the complexity of the trans- acting asRNAs, they are currently considered as less druggable targets. = Function = 'Epigenetic regulation:' a) AsRNAs can induce DNA methylation by recruiting a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). b) AsRNAs can induce histone methylation by recruiting of a histone methyltransferase (HMT). 'Co- transcriptional regulation:' c) AsRNAs can cause RNA polymerase (Pol) collision and stop the transcription. d) AsRNAs can preference translation of a specific splice variant (mRNA V1) by blocking the other splice variant (mRNA V2). 'Post-transcriptional regulation:' e) AsRNA-mRNA duplex can either block ribosome from binding to the mRNA or recruit RNase H to degrade the mRNA. By this mechanism, asRNAs directly inhibit translation of the mRNAs.  Epigenetic regulation  Many examples of asRNAs show the inhibitory effect on transcription initiation via epigenetic modifications. = DNA methylation = DNA methylation can result in long term downregulation of specific genes. Repression of functional proteins via asRNA induced DNA methylation has been found in several human disease. In a class of alpha- thalassemia, a type of blood disorder that has reduced level of hemoglobin leading to insufficient oxygen in the tissues, hemoglobin alpha1 gene (HBA1) is downregulated by an abnormal transcript of putative RNA-binding protein Luc7-like (LUC71) that serves as an asRNA to HBA1 and induces methylation of HBA1's promoter. Another example is silencing of a tumor suppressor gene p15INK4b, also called CDKN2B, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The asRNA that is responsible for this silencing effect is antisense non-coding RNA in the INK locus (ANRIL), which is expressed in the same locus that encodes for p15INK4b. = Histone modification = In eukaryotic cells, DNA is tightly packed by histones. Modification on histones can change interactions with DNA which can further induce changes in gene expression. The biological consequences of histone methylation are context dependent. In general, histone methylation leads to gene repression but gene activation can also be achieved. Evidence has shown histone methylation can be induced by asRNAs. For instance, ANRIL, in addition to the ability to induce DNA methylation, can also repress the neighboring gene of CDKN2B, CDKN2A, by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which leads to histone methylation (H3K27me). Another classic example is X chromosome inactivation by XIST. ANRIL induced epigenetic modification is an example of cis acting epigenetic regulation. In addition, Antisense RNA-induced chromatin modification can be both trans-acting. For example, in mammals, the asRNA HOTAIR is transcribed from homeobox C (HOXC) locus but it recruits PRC2 to HOXD which deposits H3K27 and silences HOXD. HOTAIR is highly expressed in primary breast tumors.  Co-transcriptional regulation  Epigenetic regulations such as DNA methylation and histone methylation can repress gene expression by inhibiting initiation of transcription. Sometimes, however, gene repression can be achieved by prematurely terminating or slowing down transcription process. AsRNAs can be involved in this level of gene regulation. For example, in bacterial or eukaryotic cells where complex RNA polymerases are present, bidirectional transcription at the same locus can lead to polymerase collision and results in the termination of transcription. Even when polymerase collision is unlikely during weak transcription, polymerase pausing can also occur which blocks elongation and leads to gene repression. One of the examples is repression of IME4 gene by its asRNA RME2. Another way of affecting transcription co-transcriptionally is by blocking splicing. One classic example in human is zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene (ZEB2) which encodes E-cadherin, a transcriptional repressor. Efficient translation of ZEB2 mRNA requires the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in intron of the mRNA at the 5' end. With the asRNA of ZEB2 being expressed, it can mask the splicing site and maintain the IRES in the mRNA which results in an efficient synthesis of E-cadherin. Lastly, depending on the level of asRNA expression, different isoforms of the sense transcript can be produced. Therefore, asRNA dependent regulation is not limited to on/off mechanism; rather, it presents a fine tone control system.  Post- transcriptional regulation  The direct post transcriptional modulation by asRNAs is refers to mRNAs being targeted by asRNAs directly; thus, the translation is affected. Some characteristics of this type of asRNAs are described in the cis- and trans- acting asRNAs. This mechanism is relatively fast because both the targeting mRNA and its asRNA need to be present simultaneously in the same cell. As described in the cis-acting asRNAs, the mRNA-asRNA pairing can result in blockage of ribosome entry and RNase H dependent degradation. Overall, mRNA-targeting asRNAs can either activate or inhibit translation of the sense mRNAs with inhibitory effect being the most abundant. = Therapeutic potential = As a regulatory element, asRNAs bear many advantages to be considered as a drug target. First of all, asRNAs regulate gene expression at multiple levels including transcription, post- transcription and epigenetic modification. Secondly, the cis-acting asRNAs are sequence specific and exhibits high degree of complementarity with the targeting genes. Thirdly, the expression level of asRNAs is very small compared to that of the targeting mRNAs; therefore, only small amount of asRNAs is required to produce an effect. In terms of drug targets, this represents a huge advantage because only a low dosage is required for effectiveness. Recent years the idea of targeting asRNAs to increase gene expression in a locus specific manner has been drawing much attention. Due to the nature of drug development, it is always easier to have drugs functioning as downregulators or inhibitors. However, there is a need in developing drugs that can activate or upregulate gene expression such as tumor suppressor genes, neuroprotective growth factors and genes that are found silenced in certain Mendelian disorders. Currently, the approach to restore deficient gene expression or protein function include enzyme replacement therapies, microRNA therapies and delivery of functional cDNA. However, each bears some drawbacks. For example, the synthesized protein used in the enzyme replacement therapies often cannot mimic the whole function of the endogenous protein. In addition, enzyme replacement therapies are life-long commitment and carry a large financial burden for the patient. Because of the locus specific nature of asRNAs and evidences of changes in asRNA expression in many diseases, there have been attempts to design single stranded oligonucleotides, referred as antagoNATs, to inhibit asRNAs and ultimately to increase specific gene expression. Despite the promises of asRNAs as drug targets or drug candidates, there are some challenges remained to be addressed.Weiss, B. (ed.): Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides and Antisense RNA : Novel Pharmacological and Therapeutic Agents, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1997. First of all, asRNAs and antagoNATs can be easily degraded by RNase or other degrading enzymes. To prevent degradation of the therapeutic oliogoneucleotides, chemical modification is usually required. The most common chemical modification on the oligonucleotides is adding a phosphorothioate linkage to the backbones. However, the phosphrothioate modification can be proinflammatory. Adverse effects including fever, chills or nausea have been observed after local injection of phosphrothioate modified oligonucleotides. Secondly, off target toxicity also represents a big problem. Despite the locus-specific nature of the endogenous asRNAs, only 10‚Äì50% synthesized oligonucleotides showed expected targeting effect. One possible reason for this problem is the high requirement on the structure of the asRNAs to be recognized by the target sequence and RNase H. A single mismatch can result in distortion in the secondary structure and lead to off target effects. Lastly, artificial asRNAs have been shown to have limited intracellular uptake. Although neurons and glia have been shown to have the ability to freely uptake naked antisense oligonucleotides, a traceable carriers such as virus and lipid vesicles would still be ideal to control and monitor the intracellular concentration and metabolism.

The proposition also makes it a misdemeanor for public officials to fail to report violations of U.S. immigration law by applicants for those public benefits and permits private lawsuits by any resident to enforce its provisions related to public benefits. The requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote was later ruled invalid in federal court. Authors of the ballot measure, the \\"Protect Arizona Now\\" committee, claimed that the provision of state identification and public benefits to individuals without adequately verifying their immigration status gave rise to opportunities for voter fraud and imposed economic hardship on the state. Opponents of the ballot measure asserted that it was anti-immigrant and reminiscent of California's 1994 Proposition 187, as well as disputed the existence of voter fraud and argued that immigrants were important contributors to the state's economy. Proponents Two separate, rival groups supported Proposition 200. The first group was the proposition's sponsor, the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) committee, led by Kathy McKee and supported at the national level by the Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population- Environment Balance (PEB). The second group was the Yes on 200 committee, led by Rusty Childress, a Phoenix-area car dealer, and supported at the national level by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). There was a split within PAN, which McKee described as an \\"attempted hijacking of a local effort by greedy, out-of-state interests\\"; this split highlighted an ongoing feud within the immigration reduction movement between FAIR and the other two groups dating back to at least 2003, with CCN and PEB issuing frequent statements accusing FAIR (as well as NumbersUSA) of being \\"reform lite\\" and \\"undermining real immigration reform.\\" PAN was formed by McKee and Childress, who became its chair and treasurer, respectively. The PAN National Advisory Board was chaired by Dr. Virginia Abernethy, and included Dr. David Pimentel and Marvin Gregory. Childress later joined a separate effort, Yes On 200, organized by FAIR. During the signature gathering campaign, McKee accused Childress of withholding funds and petitions from PAN and fired him. Childress sued McKee over custody of PAN's signatures and funds, but the court ruled in favor of McKee. Childress and the two most prominent supporters of the initiative within the Arizona state legislature, Russell Pearce and Randy Graf, then formed a separate organization, Yes On 200, which was funded almost entirely by out-of-state interests. When FAIR began an independent signature gathering campaign to collect the remaining signatures needed to put the initiative on the ballot, McKee accused FAIR of attempting a hostile takeover of PAN. When McKee named Abernethy, an avowed \\"ethnic separatist,\\" as the chair of PAN's national advisory board, FAIR responded by issuing a press release calling for both McKee and Abernethy to resign from PAN and saying that Abernethy's views were \\"repugnant, divisive and do not represent the views of the vast majority of Arizonans who support Proposition 200.\\" Abernethy's appointment drew harsh criticism from an anti-bigotry group based in Chicago, which noted her \\"leadership roles in other extremist organizations,\\" such as The Occidental Quarterly and the Council of Conservative Citizens.Migrant Foe Tied to Racism, East Valley Tribune (Tempe, AZ), August 16, 2004 (updated October 6, 2011) Campaign On July 5, 2004, Protect Arizona NOW's Chairman, Kathy McKee, pursuant to Arizona law, submitted 190,887 signatures to the Arizona Secretary of State's office, surprising critics, who had believed organizers would not be able to garner enough signatures before the deadline. A counter-organization, the Statue of Liberty Coalition, was formed to block Proposition 200, claiming the initiative was racist and would violate Latino civil rights. Opposition to Proposition 200 was bipartisan, including Senator John McCain (R), Senator Jon Kyl (R), Governor Janet Napolitano (D), the Arizona Republican Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the AFL-CIO.About.com Guide: Protect Arizona Now, Judy Hedding, August 23, 2004 Tamar Jacoby, a writer on immigration-related issues in articles for The Wall Street JournalJacoby, Tamar. \\"Flawed proposition\\".

Federally funded entitlements like food stamps and subsidized school lunches are examples of public benefits to which, given the Attorney General's finding, the new law would not apply. PAN interpreted the proposition to apply the welfare portion of the initiative to the nearly 60 programs contained in Arizona Revised Statutes Title 46, \\"Welfare.\\" Despite withstanding three pre-election and two post-election lawsuits, at least one lawsuit related to Proposition 200 is still pending. \\"Yes on 200\\" filed a post-election lawsuit, initially dismissed in the lower court but currently on appeal, saying that the Attorney General overstepped his bounds when he narrowed the definition of \\"public benefits.\\" On December 23, 2004, the federal appeals court in Tucson, Arizona removed an earlier restraining order that had kept the state from implementing the law. The entire law, with one exception, is in effect, using the definition of \\"public benefits\\" promulgated by the Governor and Attorney General. State, county, and city workers may be fined up to $700 for each instance in which they provide such benefits to persons who cannot produce evidence of citizenship. Kathy McKee has since started a new group, Protect America NOW, to support similar initiatives in other states. Voter registration and identification at the polls Proposition 200 required, among other things, proof of citizenship to register to vote and voter identification at the polling place. No major elections took place after its adoption before November 7, 2006, and the actual implementation of these two provisions of the proposition remained unclear. Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these requirements upon voters, arguing that such a law could be used to discriminate against ethnic groups, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment. On October 5, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit temporarily suspended these requirements, a little over a month before the election.AZ Secretary of State - Press Release: Sec. of State Brewer Expresses Concern and Alarm over Court Decision However, the ruling was stayed fifteen days later by the U.S. Supreme Court.AZ Secretary of State - Press Release: Sec. of State Brewer Gets ID at Polls Reinstated Purcell v.

It spans the time from around 3 million years ago when the first evidence for stone tool production and use by hominins appears in the current archaeological record, until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the Oldowan (\\"mode 1\\") and Acheulean (\\"mode 2\\") lithics industries. In African archaeology, the time period roughly corresponds to the Early Stone Age, the earliest finds dating back to 3.3 million years ago, with Lomekwian stone tool technology, spanning Mode 1 stone tool technology, which begins roughly 2.6 million years ago and ends between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago, with Mode 2 technology. The Middle Paleolithic followed the Lower Paleolithic and recorded the appearance of the more advanced prepared-core tool-making technologies such as the Mousterian. Whether the earliest control of fire by hominins dates to the Lower or to the Middle Paleolithic remains an open question. Gelasian The Lower Paleolithic began with the appearance of the first stone tools in the world. Formerly associated with the emergence of Homo habilis, some 2.8 million years ago, this date has been pushed back significantly by finds of the early 2000s, the Oldowan or Mode 1 horizon, long considered the oldest type of lithic industry, is now considered to have developed from about 2.6 million years ago, with the beginning Gelasian (Lower Pleistocene), possibly first used by australopithecine forbears of the genus Homo (such as Australopithecus garhi). Still older tools discovered at the single site of Lomekwi 3 in Kenya, announced in 2015, dated to as early as 3.3 million years ago. As such, they would predate the Pleistocene (the Gelasian), and fall into the late Pliocene (the Piacenzian). The early members of the genus Homo produced primitive tools, summarized under the Oldowan industry, which remained dominant for nearly a million years, from about 2.5 to 1.7 million years ago. Homo habilis is assumed to have lived primarily on scavenging, using tools to cleave meat off carrion or to break bones to extract the marrow. The move from the mostly frugivorous or omnivorous diet of hominin Australopithecus to the carnivorous scavenging lifestyle of early Homo has been explained by the climate changes in East Africa associated with the Quaternary glaciation. Decreasing oceanic evaporation produced a drier climate and the expansion of the savannah at the expense of forests. Reduced availability of fruits stimulated some proto-australopithecines to search out new food sources found in the drier savannah ecology. Derek Bickerton (2009) has designated to this period the move from simple animal communication systems found in all great apes to the earliest form of symbolic communication systems capable of displacement (referring to items not currently within sensory perception) and motivated by the need to \\"recruit\\" group members for scavenging large carcasses.Derek Bickerton, Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans, New York: Hill and Wang 2009. Homo erectus appeared by about 1.8 million years ago, via the transitional variety Homo ergaster.  Calabrian  Homo erectus moved from scavenging to hunting, developing the hunting-gathering lifestyle that would remain dominant throughout the Paleolithic into the Mesolithic. The unlocking of the new niche of hunting-gathering subsistence drove a number of further behavioral and physiological changes leading to the appearance of Homo heidelbergensis by some 600,000 years ago. Homo erectus migrated out of Africa and dispersed throughout Eurasia. Stone tools in Malaysia have been dated to be 1.83 million years old. The Peking Man fossil, discovered in 1929, is roughly 700,000 years old. In Europe, the Olduwan tradition (known in Europe as Abbevillian) split into two parallel traditions, the Clactonian, a flake tradition, and the Acheulean, a hand-axe tradition. The Levallois technique for knapping flint developed during this time. The carrier species from Africa to Europe was undoubtedly Homo erectus. This type of human is more clearly linked to the flake tradition, which spread across southern Europe through the Balkans to appear relatively densely in southeast Asia. Many Mousterian finds in the Middle Paleolithic have been knapped using a Levallois technique, suggesting that Neanderthals evolved from Homo erectus (or, perhaps, Homo heidelbergensis; see below). Monte Poggiolo, near Forl√¨, Italy, is the location of an Acheulian littoral handaxe industry dating from 1.8 to 1.1 million years ago. Middle Pleistocene The appearance of Homo heidelbergensis about 600,000 years ago heralds a number of other new varieties, such as Homo rhodesiensis and Homo cepranensis about 400,000 years ago. Homo heidelbergensis is a candidate for first developing an early form of symbolic language. Whether control of fire and earliest burials date to this period or only appear during the Middle Paleolithic is an open question. Also, in Europe, a type of human appeared that was intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, sometimes summarized under archaic Homo sapiens, typified by such fossils as those found at Swanscombe, Steinheim, Tautavel, and Vertesszollos (Homo palaeohungaricus). The hand-axe tradition originates in the same period. The intermediate may have been Homo heidelbergensis, held responsible for the manufacture of improved Mode 2 Acheulean tool types, in Africa, after 600,000 years ago. Flakes and axes coexisted in Europe, sometimes at the same site. The axe tradition, however, spread to a different range in the east. It appears in Arabia and India, but more importantly, it does not appear in southeast Asia. Transition to the Middle Paleolithic From about 300,000 years ago, technology, social structures and behaviour appear to grow more complex, with prepared-core technique lithics, earliest instances of burial and changes to hunting-gathering patterns of subsistence. Homo sapiens first appear about 300,000 years ago, as evidenced by fossils found at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco.

It was first performed on September 9, 1668, in the theatre of the Palais- Royal in Paris.Garreau 1984, p. 417; see also this entry at c√©sar. The play The play was first produced when Moli√®re's company was under the protection of Louis XIV. It was loosely based on the Latin comedy Aulularia by Plautus, from which many incidents and scraps of dialogue are borrowed, as well as from contemporary Italian farces.The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization, vol. 7. London: Historical Publishing Company 1906, pp.215-217Theatre history site The miser of the title is called Harpagon, a name adapted from the Latin harpago, meaning a hook or grappling iron. He is obsessed with the wealth he has amassed and always ready to save expenses. Now a widower, he has a son, Cl√©ante, and a daughter, √âlise. Although he is over sixty, he is attempting to arrange a marriage between himself and an attractive young woman, Mariane. She and Cl√©ante are already devoted to each other, however, and the son attempts to procure a loan to help her and her sick mother, who are impoverished. √âlise, Harpagon's daughter, is the beloved of Val√®re, but her father hopes to marry her to a wealthy man of his choosing, Seigneur Anselme. Meanwhile, Val√®re has taken a job as steward in Harpagon's household so as to be close to √âlise. The complications are only resolved at the end by the rather conventional discovery that some of the principal characters are long lost relatives. Satire and farce blend in the fast-moving plot, as when the miser's hoard is stolen. Asked by the police magistrate whom he suspects, Harpagon replies, ‚ÄúEverybody! I wish you to take into custody the whole town and suburbs‚Äù (5.1) and indicates the theatre audience while doing so. The play also makes fun of certain theatrical conventions, such as the spoken aside addressed to the audience, hitherto ignored by the characters onstage. The characters of L'Avare, however, generally demand to know who exactly is being spoken to.Cummings study guides Roles and original actors Harpagon and La Fl√®che in a German production of The Miser, 1810 ; Harpagon: Moli√®re : The tyrannical father of Cl√©ante and √âlise Harpagon is a sexagenarian bourgeois miser whose love for his cash box exceeds that of his children. He builds his wealth by lending at usurious rate while pinching every penny at home, refusing to replace the worn-out clothes of the servants he abuses. The sexagenarian is suitor of the young Mariane, whom Cl√©ante also wishes to marry. ; Cl√©ante: Du Croisy : Harpagon's profligate son, Cl√©ante is also in love with Mariane. Intending to run away with her, he attempts to procure an illegal loan to provide Mariane and her ill mother with money, only to discover the lender is his own father. There is mutual resentment between the two over not only money but over love when Harpagon tricks his son into revealing his love for Mariane. ; √âlise: Mlle de Brie : The daughter of Harpagon, √âlise owes her life to Val√®re, who saved her from drowning just before the beginning of the play. She opposes her father's plans to wed her to the elderly Anselme, who has agreed to take her without a dowry. ; Val√®re: La Grange : Val√®re has saved √âlise from drowning and has come into the employ of Harpagon with intentions to win her. Harpagon mistrusts him and suspects him of wanting to rob him. At the end it is revealed he is of noble Napolitan blood, the brother of Mariane, and the son of Anselme who is really Don Thomas D'Alburcy. ; La Fl√®che: Louis B√©jart : A servant in Harpagon's household, La Fl√®che helps Cl√©ante arrange a clandestine loan through Master Simon. In a dramatic turn he digs up and steals Harpagon's cash box. Master Jacques repeatedly relights a candle behind Harpagon's back. ; Master Jacques: Andr√© Hubert : Master Jacques is cook and coachman to Harpagon. ; Anselme: Mr de Brie : An elderly gentleman and suitor to √âlise, Anselme is a wandering Napolitan noble who believes his wife and children drowned sixteen years earlier. At the climax it is discovered that Val√®re and Mariane are his children and his real name is Don Thomas D'Alburcy. ; Mariane: Armande B√©jart-Moli√®re : The young woman whom Harpagon intends to wed is also the woman his son Cl√©ante intends to run away with. She is revealed at the end to be the sister of Val√®re and daughter of Anselme, who is really Don Thomas D'Alburcy of Naples. ; Master Simon: La Thorilli√®re? : A dishonest character, Master Simon tries to arrange a usurious loan between Cl√©ante and his father. ; Frosine: Madeleine B√©jart : Frosine is an elderly woman who acts as a go- between to ensure the marriage of Harpagon and Mariane; she convinces Harpagon that Mariane's frugality will outweigh her lack of dowry, and that Mariane loves bespectacled old men. Harpagon's servants with minor roles include Brindavoine, La Merluche, and Mistress Claude, a cleaning woman with no lines. In the last act appears a Magistrate who investigates the theft of the cash- box with his Clerk, who has no spoken part. Synopsis ; Act I : La Fleche is waiting for his master in Harpagon's house. Valere explains to the audience how he has assumed the role of a servant to be closer to Elise. They met when he rescued her from drowning and they fell in love. Harpagon enters, angry with La Fleche for hanging around. He suspects him of stealing something from him. La Fleche is angry at being suspected and points out that Harpagon is so careful with his money that it would be impossible to steal it. Harpagon confides in the audience expressing anxiety about the large sum of money he has buried in the garden. As Cleante and Elise enter he is again fearful that they might have heard what he is saying about the hidden money. When they approach Harpagon thinks that they are plotting to steal from him. They are actually trying to work out how to broach the subject of marriage with him since they have both found people they want to marry. Harpagon also wants to discuss marriage with them and he mentions a young girl called Mariane. Harpagon wants to know what Cleante thinks of her. Cleante is shocked and rushes off the stage. Meanwhile, Harpagon says that Elise has to marry Seigneur Anselme. Harpagon asks Valere for his opinion on the matter. Valere is trying to suck up and agrees with Harpagon's idea. Valere reassures Elise that somehow they will sort things out later. ; Act II : Cleante expresses his frustration that he and his father are rivals in love with the same woman but plans to keep his own sentiments secret while he tries to secure funds to help Mariane and her mother. Cleante has dispatched La Fleche to meet with a money- lender. Maitre Simon has acted as an intermediary between La Fleche and the money-lender until the deal is done so as to protect his identity. La Fleche explains that there are some conditions attached to the loan. Cleante is ready to accept them whatever they are, so long as he can get money to give to his beloved. When La Fleche refers to them as 'several small conditions' it is rather an understatement. Cleante is resentful but feels trapped by his desire for the money. Meanwhile, Maitre Simon enters with Harpagon discussing a young man who wants to borrow from Harpagon. Harpagon is displeased that Cleante is trying to borrow money from someone else. Cleante, dismissed by his father, expresses disgust and leaves. ; Act III : The scene begins with Harpagon calling his household together to issue instructions in preparation for Mariane's arrival for dinner. When it is Master Jacques's turn, he wants to know whether he is being consulted as coachman or cook. Master Jacques insists that he can only produce excellent food if given money. Harpagon wants his carriage cleaning and horses getting ready. Marianne enters. She is shocked at how unattractive Harpagon is when they first meet and then even more shocked to be introduced to Harpagon's son, who is no other than the man with whom she is herself in love. Cleante begins complimenting her which makes Harpagon very agitated because to him, Cleante's words sound insulting and offensive. Cleante pays her compliments on his father's behalf and tells her of an expensive array of delicacies and drinks he has arranged. He then insists they takes as a present, the diamond ring on his father's hand. He is so angry with Cleante for wasting his money. Elise arrives, is introduced to Mariane, announcing that someone has brought Harpagon some money. Harpagon quickly exits while Cleante and Elise escort Mariane on a tour of the garden. ; Act IV : Harpagon sees Cleante kissing Mariane's hand and suspects that something is happening between them. Harpagon wants Cleante to tell him his feelings about Mariane. Cleante expresses a lack of interest in her. Harpagon tricks Cleante into confessing his true feelings by suggesting he is having second thought about taking her as his wife, and would have given her to Cleante if he thought that Cleante had any feelings for her. Through further questioning, he establishes that Cleante does feel for her and has visited her a few times. Harpagon is angered when Cleante refuses to stop loving Mariane. Master Jacques is called to judge which of them is right and wrong. On stage, he moves between Cleante and Harpagon, listening to their complaints about each other and taking back to each, the version of the response by the other party that he knows each wants to hear. As Master Jacques leaves, he brings the two men together physically on stage to show their new found accord and then leaves them to a new argument. As they make up, they promise respect and tolerance to one another and say thank you to one another for allowing the other to marry Mariane. It then becomes clear as to what has happened, and the conversation returns to the former state of anger. Harpagon tells Cleante to leave and threatens to disinherit him. La Fleche enters excitedly. He has managed to steal Harpagon's money box. ; Act V : In this scene Seigneur Anselme enters. He does not want to force Elise into an unhappy marriage. Master Jacques accuses Valere of stealing Harpagon's gold. When Valere comes in he believes the crime to which Harpagon desires him to confess is the crime of stealing the love of his daughter. When Valere says that he won't deny it and he has no regrets, he refers to loving Elise but Harpagon thinks he's admitting the theft of the money. Harpagon is puzzled. He is furious with Elise for falling for Valere, especially since he believes him to be a thief. Elise tries to justify this love as Valere saved her life, but Harpagon is not interested. Valere reveals that he is the son of a man of high rank, Dom Thomas d'Alburcy from Naples. Anselme says that this cannot be true as the whole family died in a shipwreck. Valere reveals that when the ship went down, he was saved and he recently discovered his father had also survived. On his search for his father he had met, saved, and fallen for Elise and had decided the best way to be near her was to assume the role of servant. Mariane claims him as her long-lost brother. She also survived the wreck with her mother and eventually came to France. Anselme then reveals he is their father. Harpagon's first reaction is to hold Anselme responsible for the theft of his money. He shows no other emotion than greed. Harpagon is wary of letting them marry because of the cost of a wedding. However, Anselme generously offers to pay for everything. Harpagon is more bothered to find out who took his money. Cleante returns to Harpagon and negotiates with him for the right to marry Mariane in return for getting his money back. Sources Aside from the example of contemporary misers, Moli√®re drew from a number of ancient and contemporary sources for elements in his The Miser. The character of Harpagon draws from the Latin play Aulularia by Plautus in which the miser Euclio incessantly changes the hiding place of his pot of gold out of fear of having it stolen, and the miser's fourth-act monologue exaggerating the loss of his pot was the basis for Harpagon's. Also from Aulularia Moli√®re appropriated the love affair between √âlise and Val√®re, Harpagon's inspection of the hands of La Fl√®che, and Val√®re's avowals of love for √âlise that Harpagon takes as his confession to theft. La Belle Plaideuse (1655) of Fran√ßois le M√©tel de Boisrobert furnished Moli√®re with the father-as-usurer, and the scene in which a lender lends the borrower 15,000 francs, of which 3,000 is in goods; several of these items appear in the list in The Miser. Jean Donneau de Vis√©'s la M√®re coquette (1665) gave Moli√®re a father and son in love with the same young woman. Theatrical adaptations Moli√®re, Charles-Antoine Coypel, 1730 Very soon after the play's first production in 1668, versions began to appear elsewhere in Europe. A German translation, ', appeared in Frankfurt in 1670. In England Thomas Shadwell adapted Moli√®re's work under the title \\"The Miser\\" in 1672 and added eight new characters.Albert S. Borgman, Thomas Shadwell, his life and comedies, New York 1969, pp.141-7 An even more popular version based on both Plautus and Moli√®re was produced by Henry Fielding in 1732.Available on Google Books In Italian commedia dell'arte there was already a tradition of depicting misers as the Pantaleone figure, who was represented as a rich and avaricious Venetian merchant.The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre,Pantaloon entry, p.374 However, Moli√®re's play was eventually adapted to opera. Giovanni Bertati's libretto based on the play was set by Pasquale Anfossi as L'avaro in 1775 and in 1776 it was set again by Gennaro Astarita. Giuseppe Palomba also wrote a libretto based on the work which was set by Giacomo Cordella in 1814. In Russia, too, Vasily Pashkevich based his 18th century comic opera The Miser on Moli√®re's play. Another musical adaptation in Arabic was pioneered by the Lebanese Marun al-Naqqash (1817‚Äì55) as al-Bakhil. This was performed in Beirut in 1847.M.M.Badawi, ‚ÄúArabic drama: early developments‚Äù in Modern Arabic Literature, Cambridge 1992, pp.331-2 Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, the founding father of Serbian theatre, based his Tvrdica (The Miser, 1837) on Moli√®re's play. In this work, the Harpagon figure is represented as a small town Greek merchant.McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama, 1984 One reason for so many versions must be the acknowledged fact that Moli√®re's humour does not translate well and requires more or less free adaptation to succeed.Encyclopedia of Literary Translation Into English, Chicago 2000, p.956ff The history of De Vrek, Taco de Beer's 1863 translation into Dutch provides another notable example. In 1878 he adapted this to Dutch contemporary life and an edition of that version found its way to Indonesia. There it was further adapted into Malay as Si Bachil and given a contemporary Indonesian background. In 1941 this production in turn served as basis for Tamar Djaja's novel of the same title, by which time the story had become all but unrecognisable.Eva Tsoi Hung Hung, Judy Wakabayashi, Asian Translation Traditions, pp.242-3 The earliest American production of a play titled The Miser was of Fielding's version in the years following 1766.George O. Seilhamer, History of the American Theatre Volume 1, New York 1969, p.164 A Broadway production of a translation of Moli√®re's play ran for only three nights at the Experimental Theatre in 1936Internet Broadway Database and there have been several revivals since in one version or another. An audio recording of the 1969 Lincoln Center production was released by Caedmon Records (TRS 338. To date this is the only known English recording of the play and there is no translator listed in the album liner notes. An Australian musical theatre adaptation with the name Mistress Money premiered in Sydney in 1960. It had book and lyrics by Eleanor Witcombe and John McKellar and music by Dot Mendoza. More recently in Britain, John Coutts' English-Scots version of The Miser was performed in 2009 under the title The Auld Skinflint.Scots language site In 2012 the play was made into a Bollywood musical titled Kanjoos The Miser by Hardeep Singh Kohli and Jatinder Verma and toured the UK.The Stage website Film, television and audio adaptations * In 1969, Caedmon Records released a recording of The Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center's production of The Miser (TRS 338) directed on stage by Carl Weber and featuring Robert Symonds as Harpagon, Blythe Danner as Elise, David Birney as Cleante and Lili Darvas as Frosine.

A reef aquarium requires appropriately intense lighting, turbulent water movement, and more stable water chemistry than fish-only marine aquaria, and careful consideration is given to which reef animals are appropriate and compatible with each other. Components Reef aquariums consist of a number of components, in addition to the livestock, including: Display tank: The primary tank in which the livestock are kept and shown. Stand: A stand allows for placement of the display tank at eye level and provides space for storage of the accessory components. Sump: An accessory tank in which mechanical equipment is kept. A remote sump allows for a clutter-free display tank. Refugium: An accessory tank dedicated to the cultivation of beneficial macroalgae and microflora/fauna. The refugium and sump are often housed in a single tank with a system of dividers to separate the compartments. Lighting: Several lighting options are available for the reef-keeper and are tailored to the types of coral kept. Canopy: The canopy houses the light fixtures and provides access to the tank for feeding and maintenance. Filtration and water movement: A variety of filtration and water movement strategies are employed in reef aquaria. Bulky equipment is often relegated to the sump. =Display tank= right A \\"reef ready\\" or simply \\"drilled\\" tank is often used. This style of tank has holes drilled into the rear pane allowing water to drain into the sump or refugium. These drains are usually housed in an internal overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass which encloses a drain standpipe and a water return line (See fig 1, a). The surface water pours over the overflow, down the standpipe (See fig 1, b), through PVC piping, into the sump. After transiting the sump, water is pushed by a return water pump through the second hole and into the aquarium (See fig 1, c). Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums employ an external \\"hang-on\\" overflow that feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump (See fig 1 d). The tanks are usually constructed from either glass or acrylic. Acrylic has the advantage of optical clarity, lightness, and ease of drilling. Drawbacks include a tendency to scratch easily, bowing, and often limited access from above due to top bracing. Glass aquariums are heavier but harder to scratch. Other materials such as epoxy-coated plywood have been used by industrious DIYers, but these materials are typically reserved for the construction of larger tanks. =Filtration= The primary biological filtration for reef aquariums usually comes from the use of live rock which come from various tropical zones around existing reefs, or more recently aquacultured rock from Florida. Some reefkeepers also use what is called deep sand beds (DSB).Toonen, Robert, Ph.D. and Wee, Christopher. \\"An Experimental Comparison of Sandbed and Plenum-Based Systems. Part 1: Controlled lab dosing experiments.\\" Advanced Aquarist 4.2 (2005) These are often employed to augment the biological filtration by aiding in the reduction of nitrate, a waste product in an incomplete nitrogen cycle. Deep sand bed opponents may prefer a \\"bare bottom\\" or \\"suspended reef\\" which allows for easier removal of nitrate-generating accumulated detritus. This biological filtration is usually supplemented by protein skimmers. Protein skimmers use the foam fractionation process wherein air is introduced into a water stream creating microbubbles. Organic waste adheres to the surface of these microbubbles and is removed as it overflows at the reactor surface into a removable cup. This group of elements used in conjunction is characteristic of the Berlin Method, named for the city in which it was first devised. In recent years the Berlin Method is often supplemented with a refugium. A refugium provides many benefits, which include nitrate reduction, as well as providing a natural food source. It typically houses two main species of macroalgae, including Caulerpa prolifera or chaetomorphae or both (because these two strains are known not to spore but grow by rooting to propagate). Macroalgae is used for two reasons: to remove from the water excess nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate, and iron, and to support beneficial microflora and fauna (zooplankton). Small invertebrates (copepods and amphipods) are provided a space free of predation to grow and, when returned to the display tank, serve as food for corals and fish. Conventional combined mechanical/biological filtration used in fish only systems is avoided because those filters trap detritus and produce nitrates which may stunt or even kill many delicate corals. Chemical filtration in the form of activated carbon is used when needed to remove discoloration of the water, or to remove dissolved matter (organic or otherwise) to help purify the water in the reef system. =Water movement= An example of a closed loop water circulation systemWater movement is important in the reef aquarium with different types of coral requiring different flow rates. At present, many hobbyists advocate a water turnover rate of 10x: 10 x aquarium capacity in gallons = required flow in gallons per hour ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†this is mathematically equivalent to a complete aquarium water turnover every 6 minutes. This is a general rule with many exceptions. Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little flow to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble coral, elegance coral, cup coral, torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of flow, and small polyp stony corals such as Acropora, Montipora, Porites, and Pocillopora require high, turbulent, conditions, which imitates breaking waves in shallow water near the tip of the reef. The directions which water pumps are pointed within an aquarium will have a large effect on flow speeds. Many corals will gradually move themselves to a different area of the tank if the water movement in its current area is not satisfactory. > \\"Since flow speed is the critical measure for determining the rate of gas > exchange, turnover does little to convey how fast a coral will respire and > photosynthesize.\\"Adams, Jake. \\"Water Flow is More Important for Corals Than > Light, Part V.\\" Advanced Aquarist V.6.1 (2007). > http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2007/1/aafeature/view?searchterm=flow Reef ready tanks obtain at least a portion of the required water motion from the pump that returns water from the sump. This flow usually is augmented by other strategies. A popular strategy is placement within the display tank of multiple powerheads. Powerheads are simply small submersible water pumps that produce a laminar or narrow, unidirectional water stream. If the presence of the powerhead in the tank does not fit with the aesthetics of the display, small holes may be drilled in an overflow of a tank and the bulk of the powerhead can be hidden, leaving only the small funnel spout visible in the tank. The pumps may be alternately switched on and off using a wave timer and aimed at one another or at the aquarium glass to create turbulent flow in the tank. Drawbacks to the use of these powerheads include their capacity to clutter the display tank, propensity for excess heat production, and the laminar quality of water flow often produced. Another method is the closed loop in which water is pulled from the main tank into a pump which returns the water back into the aquarium via one or more returns to create water turbulence. Newer submersible propeller pumps are gaining popularity and are able to generate large volumes of turbulent water flow without the intensely directed laminar force of a power head. Propeller pumps are more energy- efficient than powerheads, but require a higher initial investment. Another recent method is the gyre tank. A gyre tank encourages a maximum amount of water momentum through a divider in the center of the aquarium. The divider leaves an open, unobstructed space which provides a region with little friction against water movement. Building water momentum using a gyre is an efficient method to increase flow, thus benefiting coral respiration and photosynthesis. Water flow is important to bring food to corals, since no coral fully relies on photosynthesis for food. Gas exchange occurs as water flows over a coral, bringing oxygen and removing gases and shedding material. Water flow assists in reducing the risk of thermal shock and damage by reducing the coral's surface temperature. The surface temperature of a coral living near the water's surface can be significantly higher than the surrounding water due to infrared radiation. =Lighting= With the advent of newer and better technologies, increasing intensities and a growing spectrum, there are many options to consider. Many, if not most aquarium corals contain within their tissue the symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. It is these zooxanthellae that require light to perform photosynthesis and in turn produce simple sugars that the corals utilize for food. The challenge for the hobbyist is to provide enough light to allow photosynthesis to maintain a thriving population of zooxanthellae in a coral tissue. Though this may seem simple enough but in reality can prove to be a very complex task. Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little light to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble coral, elegance coral, cup coral, torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of light, and small polyp stony corals such as Acropora, Montipora, Porites, and Pocillopora require high intensity lighting. Of the various types, most popular aquarium lighting comes from metal halide lamps, very high output or VHO, compact fluorescent and T5 high output lighting systems. Although they were once widely used, many reef tank aquarists have abandoned T12 and T8 fluorescent lamps due to their poor intensity, and mercury vapor due to its production of a limited light spectrum. Recent advances in lighting technology have also made available a completely new technology for aquarium lighting: light emitting diodes (LEDs). Although LEDs themselves are not new, the technology has only recently been adapted to produce systems with qualities that allow them to be considered viable alternatives to gas- and filament-based aquarium lighting systems. The newness of the technology does cause them to be relatively expensive, but these systems bring several advantages over traditional lighting. Although their initial cost is much higher, they tend to be economical in the long run because they consume less power and have far longer lifespans than other systems. Also, because LED systems are made of hundreds of very small bulbs, a microcomputer can control their output to simulate daybreak and sunset. Some systems also have the ability to simulate moonlight and the phases of the moon, as well as vary the color temperature of the light produced. Moreover, some manufacturers produce LED lighting systems in single bright and double bright intensities for sustaining coral life in marine aquariums. The choices for aquarium lighting are made complicated by variables such as color temperature, (measured in kelvins), color rendering index (CRI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and lumens. Power output available to the hobbyist can range from a meager 9 W fluorescent lamp to a blinding 1000 W metal halide lamp. Lighting systems also vary in the light output produced by each bulb type‚Äîlisted in order of weakest to strongest they would be: T8/12 or normal output lamps, compact fluorescent and T5 high output, VHO, and metal halide lamps. To further complicate matters, there are several types of ballasts available: electric ballast, magnetic ballast, and pulse start ballast. =Heating and cooling= Reef tanks are usually kept at a temperature between 25 and 28 ¬∞C (75-82 ¬∞F). Radical temperature shifts should be avoided as these can be particularly harmful to reef invertebrates and fish. Depending on the location of the tank and the conditions therein (i.e. heat/air conditioning), one may install a heater and/or a chiller for the tank. Heaters are relatively inexpensive and readily available at any local fish store. Aquarists frequently use the sump to hide unsightly equipment such as heaters. Chillers, on the other hand, are expensive and are more difficult to locate. For many aquarists, installing surface fans and running home air conditioning suffice in place of a chiller. Fans cool the tank via evaporative cooling and require more frequent top-off of the aquarium water. =Water chemistry= Stony corals, which are defined by their calcareous calcium carbonate skeletons (CaCO3), are the focus of many advanced reef keepers. These corals require additional attention to water chemistry, especially maintenance of stable and optimal calcium, carbonate, and pH levels. These parameters may be tracked and adjusted with test kits and frequent manual dosing of calcium and pH buffer additives requiring no additional equipment. Alternatively, automated methods employing small dedicated computers with electronic water quality monitoring capabilities are often used to control water chemistry parameters via several components including calcium reactors and kalkwasser reactors. Calcium reactors are canisters filled with crushed coral skeletons. Carbon dioxide is injected into the canister acidifying the water and dissolving the coral skeletons. The acidified and CaCO3 rich solution is then pumped into the sump. The excess CO2 then diffuses out of the water and into the air leaving behind the CaCO3. Kalkwasser is an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. The kalk reactor stirs and dispenses the solution into the sump where the Ca(OH)2 combines with dissolved CO2 to produce CaCO3. These components must be controlled by a computer to prevent dangerous changes in pH due to the acidic calcium reactor effluent or alkaline kalkwasser effluent. Optimal water parameters are: *Salinity: 1.022‚Äì1.025 sg or 30‚Äì34 parts per thousand *Temperature: 24-27 ¬∞C (76‚Äì80 ¬∞F) *Ammonia (NH3): 0 ppm (parts per million) *Nitrite (NO2‚àí): 0 ppm *Nitrate (NO3‚àí): 0‚Äì10 ppm *Phosphate (PO43‚àí): 0‚Äì0.06 ppm *pH: 8.2‚Äì8.6 *Calcium (Ca2+): 400‚Äì450 ppm *Alkalinity: 7‚Äì12 dKH Trace elements can become depleted by marine livestock and filtration, and can be replenished during a water change. =Safety= Large volumes of electrically conductive salt water, complex plumbing, and numerous electrical appliances housed in close proximity certainly pose a significant risk of damage to both person and property and require close attention to safety. All equipment should be used according to manufacturer instructions. Electrical equipment should be placed above water level whenever possible, and drip loops should always be used. Circuit limits should never be exceeded and all appliances should be plugged into ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets. These can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively easy to install. Plug in GFCI power strips are also readily available. Home monitoring equipment with water sensors can also be adapted for the home aquarist and used to alert the owner of power outages or water overflows. This equipment can allow for timely intervention in a potential disaster and provides an added sense of security for frequent travelers. Nano reefs 14 litre (3 gallon) nano reef containing small and large polyped stony corals, as well as various soft coralsA nano reef is a type of marine aquarium that is typically less than 140 litres (30 Imperial gallons / 37 US gallons). The exact limit that distinguishes a nano reef from a regular reef is somewhat ill-defined. Some claim that anything less than 180 litres (40 Imperial gallons / 48 US gallons) would qualify. But 140 litres (30 Imperial gallons / 37 US gallons) seems to be the generally accepted limit. Nano reefs have become quite popular in recent years among fish keeping hobbyists, primarily because of their smaller size, maintainability, and the possibility of lower costs. The burgeoning interest in this niche of marine aquarium science has fostered several notable contributions ranging from specific consumer products such as specialized aquarium filters, compact high intensity lighting systems and smaller circulation pumps. Such equipment allows the aquarist to maintain an environment wherein many marine organisms are capable of thriving. The first reference to these small reef aquariums was made in 1989 by Albert J. Thiel in his book Small Reef Aquarium Basics. Nano reefs are very commonly sold as complete kits which contain the tank, stand, power compact T5, T8, PL lamps or metal halide lighting, protein skimmer, UV steriliser, 3 or more stage filtration, a heater and a water pump or powerhead. However, many nano reefkeepers decide to upgrade their aquariums with better quality equipment such as a more powerful protein skimmer or lighting. =Pico reefs= Another term gaining popularity is pico reef, which is used to refer to the smallest of nano reef aquariums. Most online forum polls set the range of approximately 10 litres (2.5 gallons) and below as pico reefs.These tiny tanks require even more diligence with regard to water changes and attention to water chemistry because the small water volume provides little room for error. Care must be exercised when stocking these tiny tanks because too many inhabitants can easily overload the tank's ability to process wastes effectively. For the smallest of pico reefs, even the presence of a single fish is discouraged. Pico reefs often consist of live rock, hardy corals, and small invertebrates such as hermit crabs and marine snails. The keeping of pico reef aquariums has tested the extent of allelopathy, the chemical and physical means by which corals compete for space. Before the advent of these concentrated environments, it was thought to be impossible for corals of even a few mixed genera to occupy such a small shared water volume.The history of pico reef biology. =Challenges associated with small reef aquariums= Due to the small water volume, fluctuations of water quality occur more easily, and so nano reef aquariums require extra attention to water quality compared to aquariums of larger water volumes. Many experienced reef aquarists recommend testing the water twice weekly, with water changes at least every week. In particular, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, salinity, alkalinity, calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored closely. When it comes to nano reefs, even minute changes in water conditions such as mild temperature fluctuations can be problematic, whereas the greater water volume of larger aquariums provides a more stable and flexible environment. Nano reefs also require extra care in the selection of occupants. There are two major factors to be considered: biological load, i.e., the ability of the tank to process the wastes produced by the occupants, and species compatibility. These issues, though present in larger tanks, are magnified in the nano tank. Species considered reef safe and able to coexist in larger tanks may not do well in a nano tank because of their close physical proximity. For this reason, smaller species of fish, such as gobies and clownfish, are popular choices because of their relatively small size and ability to coexist peacefully with other tank inhabitants. =Filtration in nano reefs= Many nano reef aquarists prefer their displays to be as natural-looking as possible, and therefore choose to use as few mechanical filtration methods as possible. A primary filtration method in nano reefs is live rock and live sand, which are pieces of rock and sand that have broken from the coral reef and are populated with beneficial bacteria and other organisms that aid in breaking down organic wastes produced by larger organisms in the nano reef. Other nano reef aquarists use devices such as protein skimmers to remove excess waste from the aquarium, before it has a chance to be broken down to nitrate. Removing the excess wastes mechanically can reduce the frequency of water changes needed to keep nitrate levels low. Delaying the action of the mechanical filters, such as by means of a day-night timer, can allow invertebrates to filter-feed naturally. A refugium may also be used to export nutrients, when packed with macroalgae such as Chaetomorpha, and live rock. Deep sand bed filters are another filtration method. Recently there have been several \\"natural\\" methods of processing waste in the aquarium and specifically small environments as nano-reefs. The research on the encouragement of the development of different types of sponges and micro- organisms to process the pollutants in the aquarium, a matter that has been gaining popularity in the aquarium community.

He was the fourth among Kannada writers to be honored with the Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honor conferred in India. He was popularly referred to as Maasti Kannadada Aasti which means \\"Maasti, Kannada's Treasure\\". He is most renowned for his short stories. He wrote under the pen name Srinivasa. He was honoured with the title Rajasevasakta by then Maharaja of Mysore Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadeyar. Early life and education Maasti was born in 1891 at Hungenahalli in Kolar district of Karnataka in a Tamil language speaking Sri Vaishnavaite family. He spent his early childhood in Maasti village. He obtained a master's degree in English literature (Arts) in 1914 from Madras University. After joining the Indian Civil Service (Known as the Mysore Civil Service in the days of the Maharaja of Mysore), he held various positions of responsibility in different parts of Karnataka, rising to the rank of District Commissioner. After 26 years of service, he resigned in 1943, as a protest when he did not get the post equivalent to a Minister, which he felt that he deserved, and a junior was promoted ahead of him. He wrote some pieces in English and then switched to writing in the Kannada language. He often used the pen name Srinivasa. Masti Venkatesh Iyengar Works He published his first work, Rangana Maduve in 1910. His last work was Maatugara Ramanna, from 1985. Kelavu Sanna Kategalu (Some Short Stories) was his first notable work in modern Kannada literature. Maasti also crafted a number poems on various philosophic, aesthetic and social themes. He composed and translated several important plays and was the editor of the monthly journal Jivana (Life) from 1944 to 1965. A prolific writer, he wrote more than 123 books in Kannada and 17 in English, over the course of seventy years. He won the Jnanpith Award in 1983 for his novel Chikavira Rajendra. The story was about the last Rajah of Kodagu. He died on his 95th birthday in 1986. Since 1993, an award in his name, the \\"Masti Venkatesha Iyengar Award\\" is presented to well-known writers from Karnataka. His house is located in Basavanagudi area in Bangalore. His house, located in Maasti village, Maluru Taluk (Kolar District) has been converted into a library and maintained by the Government of Karnataka.

It is most commonly used in commercial applications like municipal water treatment facilities and public aquariums. Smaller protein skimmers are also used for filtration of home saltwater aquariums. Function Protein skimming removes certain organic compounds, including proteins and amino acids found in food particles, by using the polarity of the protein itself. Due to their intrinsic charge, water-borne proteins are either repelled or attracted by the air/water interface and these molecules can be described as hydrophobic (such as fats or oils) or hydrophilic (such as salt, sugar, ammonia, most amino acids, and most inorganic compounds). However, some larger organic molecules can have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. These molecules are called amphipathic or amphiphilic. Commercial protein skimmers work by generating a large air/water interface, specifically by injecting large numbers of bubbles into the water column. In general, the smaller the bubbles the more effective the protein skimming is because the surface area of small bubbles occupying the same volume is much greater than the same volume of larger bubbles.P. R. Escobal: Aquatic Systems Engineering: Devices and How They Function, Dimension Engineering Press, 2000, Large numbers of small bubbles present an enormous air/water interface for hydrophobic organic molecules and amphipathic organic molecules to collect on the bubble surface (the air/water interface). Water movement hastens diffusion of organic molecules, which effectively brings more organic molecules to the air/water interface and lets the organic molecules accumulate on the surface of the air bubbles. This process continues until the interface is saturated, unless the bubble is removed from the water or it bursts, in which case the accumulated molecules release back into the water column. However, it is important to note that further exposure of a saturated air bubble to organic molecules may continue to result in changes as compounds that bind more strongly may replace those molecules with a weaker binding that have already accumulated on the interface. Although some aquarists believe that increasing the contact time (or dwell time as it is sometimes called) is always good, it is incorrect to claim that it is always better to increase the contact time between bubbles and the aquarium water.Holmes-Farley, Randy, What is Skimming?, Reefkeeping, August 2006, http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2006-08/rhf/index.php As the bubbles increase near the top of the protein skimmer water column, they become denser and the water begins to drain and create the foam that will carry the organic molecules to the skimmate collection cup or to a separate skimmate waste collector and the organic molecules, and any inorganic molecules that may have become bound to the organic molecules, will be exported from the water system. In addition to the proteins removed by skimming, there are a number of other organic and inorganic molecules that are typically removed. These include a variety of fats, fatty acids, carbohydrates, metals such as copper, and trace elements such as iodine. Particulates, phytoplankton, bacteria, and detritus are also removed; this is desired by some aquarists, and is often enhanced by placement of the skimmer before other forms of filtration, lessening the burden on the filtration system as a whole. There is at least one published study that provides a detailed list of the export products removed by the skimmer.Shimak, Ronald L, Ph. D., \\"Down the Drain, Exports From Reef Aquaria, Reefkeeping, Dec. 2002, http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2002-12/rs/feature/index.php Aquarists who keep filter-feeding invertebrates, however, sometimes prefer to keep these particulates in the water to serve as natural food. Protein skimmers are used to harvest algae and phytoplankton gently enough to maintain viability for culturing or commercial sale as live cultures. Alternative forms of water filtration have recently come into use, including the algae scrubber, which leaves food particles in the water for corals and small fish to consume, but removes the noxious compounds including ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate that protein skimmers do not remove. Design All skimmers have key features in common: water flows through a chamber and is brought into contact with a column of fine bubbles. The bubbles collect proteins and other substances and carry them to the top of the device where the foam, but not the water, collects in a cup. Here the foam condenses to a liquid, which can be easily removed from the system. The material that collects in the cup can range from pale greenish-yellow, watery liquid to a thick black tar. Alpha 170, designed by Klaus Jensen Consider this summary of optimal protein skimmer design by Randy Holmes-Farley:Holmes-Farley, Randy, What is Skimming?, Reefkeeping, August 2006, http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2006-08/rhf/index.php > For a skimmer to function maximally, the following things must take place: > 1\\\\. A large amount of air/water interface must be generated. > 2\\\\. Organic molecules must be allowed to collect at the air/water > interface. > 3\\\\. The bubbles forming this air/water interface must come together to form > a foam. > 4\\\\. The water in the foam must partially drain without the bubbles popping > prematurely. > 5\\\\. The drained foam must be separated from the bulk water and discarded. > Also under considerable recent attention has been the general shape of a skimmer as well. In particular, much attention has been given to the introduction of cone shaped skimmer units. Originally designed by Klaus Jensen in 2004, the concept was founded on the principle that a conical body allows the foam to accumulate more steadily through a gently sloping transition. This reduces the overall turbulence, resulting in more efficient skimming. While research into the specific benefits of the design are still being measured, early reviews of many conical skimmers have been positive overall.http://proteinskimmerinfo.com/vertex-royal-exclusiv-alpha- cone-250-protein-skimmer-review/ Cylindrical-shaped protein skimmers are also common.The Best Protein Skimmer For Your Fish Tank, Fishcareguide, August 2017, https://fishcareguide.com/the-best-protein-skimmer-for-your-fish-tank/ Overall, protein skimmers can be classed in two ways depending on whether they operate by co-current flow or counter-current flow. In a co-current flow system, air is introduced at the bottom of the chamber and is in contact with the water as it rises upwards towards the collection chamber. In a counter- current system, air is forced into the system under pressure and moves against the flow of the water for a while before it rises up towards the collection cup. Because the air bubbles may be in contact with the water for a longer period in a counter-current flow system, protein skimmers of this type are considered by some to be more effective at removing organic wastes.Escobal 2000 =Co-current flow systems= Air stone The original method of protein skimming, running pressurized air through a diffuser to produce large quantities of micro bubbles, remains a viable, effective, and economic choice, although newer technologies may require lower maintenance. The air stone is most often an oblong, partially hollowed block of wood, most often of the genus Tilia. The most popular wooden air-stones for skimmers are made from limewood (Tilia europaea or European limewood) although basswood (Tilia americana or American Linden), works as well, may be cheaper and is often more readily available. The wooden blocks are drilled, tapped, fitted with an air fitting, and connected by air tubing to one or more air pumps delivering at least 1 cfm. The wooden air stone is placed at the bottom of a tall column of water. The tank water is pumped into the column, allowed to pass by the rising bubbles, and back into the tank. To get enough contact time with the bubble, these units can be many feet in height. Air stone protein skimmers may be constructed as a DIY project from pvc pipes and fittings at low cost and with varying degrees of complexity . While this method has been around for many years, many regard it as inefficient for larger systems or systems with large bio-loads. Venturi The premise behind these skimmers is that a venturi pump, or aspirator, can be used to introduce the bubbles into the water stream. The tank water is pumped through the venturi, in which fine bubbles are introduced, then enters the skimmer body. This method was popular due to its compact size and high efficiency but venturi designs are now more likely to be included in other skimmer designs rather than as a simple venturi design. =Counter-current flow systems= Aspirating: pin-wheel/adrian- wheel, needle-wheel, mesh-wheel This basic concept is more correctly known as an aspirating skimmer, since some skimmer designs using an aspirator do not use a \\"Pin-Wheel\\"/\\"Adrian-Wheel\\" or \\"Needle-Wheel\\". \\"Pin-Wheel\\"/\\"Adrian-Wheel\\" describes the look of an impeller that consists of a disk with pins mounted perpendicular (90¬∞) to the disc and parallel to the rotor. \\"Needle-Wheel\\" describes the look of an impeller that consists of a series of pins projecting out perpendicular to the rotor from a central axis. \\"Mesh-Wheel\\" describes the look of an impeller that consists of a mesh material attached to a plate or central axis on the rotor. The purpose of these modified impellers is to chop or shred the air that is introduced via a venturi apparatus or external air pump into very fine bubbles. The Mesh-Wheel design is fairly new and, while providing excellent results in the short term because of its ability to draw in more air and create finer bubbles with its thin cutting surfaces, it is still being developed and will likely continue to evolve over a few more years. This style of protein skimmer has become very popular and is believed to be the most popular type of skimmer used with residential reef aquariums today. It has been particularly successful in smaller aquariums due to its usually compact size, ease of set up and use, and quiet operation. Since the pump is pushing a mixture of air and water, the power required to turn the rotor can be decreased and may result in a lower power requirement for that pump vs. the same pump with a different impeller when it is only pumping water. Downdraft The Downdraft skimmer is both a proprietary skimmer design and a style of protein skimmer that injects water under high pressure into tubes that have a foam or bubble generating mechanism and carry the air/water mixture down into the skimmer and into a separate chamber. The proprietary design is protected in the United States with patents and commercial skimmer products in the US are limited to that single company. Their design uses one or more tubes with plastic media such as bio balls inside to mix water under high pressure and air in the body of the skimmer resulting in foam that collects protein waste in a collection cup. This was one of the earlier high performance protein skimmer designs and large models were produced that saw success in large and public aquariums. Beckett skimmer The Beckett skimmer has some similarities to the downdraft skimmer but introduced a foam nozzle to produce the flow of air bubbles. The name Beckett comes from the patented foam nozzle developed and sold by the Beckett Corporation (United States), although similar foam nozzle designs are sold by other companies outside the United States (e.g. Sicce (Italy)). Instead of using the plastic media that is found in downdraft skimmer designs, the Beckett skimmer uses design concepts from previous generations of skimmers, specifically the downdraft skimmer and the venturi skimmer (the Beckett 1408 Foam Nozzle is a modified 4 port venturi) to produce a hybrid that is capable of using powerful pressure rated water pumps and quickly processing large amounts of aquarium water in a short period of time. Commercial Beckett skimmers come in single Beckett, dual Beckett, and quad Beckett designs. Well engineered Beckett skimmers are quiet and reliable but the powerful pumps used in larger Beckett skimmer designs can take up additional space, introduce additional noise, and use more electricity than less powerful pumps. Unlike the Downdraft and Spray Induction skimmers, Beckett skimmer designs are produced by a number of companies in the United States and elsewhere and are not known to be restricted by patents. Spray induction This method is related to the downdraft, but uses a pump to power a spray nozzle, fixed a few inches above the water level. The spray action entraps and shreds the air in the base of the unit, which then rises to the collection chamber. In the United States, one company has patented the spray induction technology and the commercial product offerings are limited to that single company. =Recirculating skimmer designs= A recent trend is to change the method by which the skimmer is fed 'dirty' water from the aquarium as a means to recirculate water within the skimmer multiple times before it is returned to the sump or the aquarium. Aspirating pump skimmers are the most popular type of skimmer to use recirculating designs although other types of skimmers, such as Beckett skimmers, are also available in recirculating versions. While there is a popular belief among some aquarist that this recirculation increases the dwell or contact time of the generated air bubbles within the skimmer there is no authoritative evidence that this is true. Each time water is recirculated within the skimmer any air bubbles in that water sample are destroyed and new bubbles are generated by the recirculating pump venturi apparatus so the air- water contact time begins again for these newly created bubbles. In non- recirculating skimmer designs, a skimmer has one inlet supplied by a pump that pulls water in from the aquarium and injects it with air into the skimmer and releasing the foam or air/water mix into the reaction chamber. With a recirculating design, the one inlet is usually driven by a separate feed pump, or in some cases may be gravity fed, to receive the dirty water to process, while the pump providing the foam or air/water mix into the reaction chamber is set up separately in a closed loop on the side of the skimmer. The recirculating pump pulls water out of the skimmer and injects air to generate the foam or air/water mix before returning it to the skimmer reaction chamber‚Äîthus 'recirculating' it. The feed pump in a recirculating design typically injects a smaller amount of dirty water than co/counter-current designs. The separate feed pump allows easy control of the rate of water exchange through the skimmer and for many aquarists this is one of the important attractions of recirculating skimmer designs. Because the pump configuration of these skimmers is similar to that of aspirating pump skimmers, the power consumption advantages are also similar.

She was enslaved and owned by Samuel Parris of Danvers, Massachusetts. Although her origins are debated, research has suggested that she was a South American native and sailed from Barbados to New England with Samuel Parris. Little is known regarding Tituba's life prior to her enslavement. She became a pivotal figure in the witch trials when she confessed to witchcraft while also making claims that both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne participated in said witchcraft. She was imprisoned and later released by Samuel Conklin, but little to nothing is known about Tituba's life following her subsequent release. Early life and accusations against her Tituba's husband was John Indian, an Indigenous man whose origins are unknown, but he may have been from Central or South America. Tituba may have been originally been from Barbados. The often unreliable records of the enslaved persons origins makes this information difficult to verify. There are historians such as Samuel Drake who suggest that Tituba was African.Tituba, Reluctant Witch by Elaine Breslaw p. xxi It is possible that she was born in Barbados.Tituba, Reluctant Witch by Elaine Breslaw p. 3 ‚Äì 20 Her husband went on to become one of the accusers in the Witch Trials. They appear documented together in Samuel Parris's church record book. Tituba was the first person to be accused by Elizabeth Parris and Abigail Williams of witchcraft. It has been theorized that Tituba told the girls tales of voodoo and witchcraft prior to the accusations. She was also the first to confess to witchcraft in Salem Village in March 1692. Initially denying her involvement in witchcraft, Tituba later confessed to making a \\"witchcake\\", due to being beaten by Samuel Parris with the intention of getting a confession. When questioned later, she added that she knew about occult techniques from her mistress in Barbados, who taught her how to ward herself from evil powers and how to reveal the cause of witchcraft. Since such knowledge was not meant for harm, Tituba again asserted to Parris she was not a witch, but admitted she had participated in an occult ritual when she made the witchcake in an attempt to help Elizabeth Parris.Breslaw, Elaine G. Tituba, Reluctant Witch of Salem: Devilish Indians and Puritan Fantasies. New York: New York University Press, 1996, pp. 107, 170, et al. Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne were sent to jail in Boston to await trial and punishment on March 7, 1692. Despite these confessions, there is no proof that she did the things to which she confessed. Other women and men from surrounding villages were accused of witchcraft and arrested at the Salem witchcraft trials. Not only did Tituba accuse others in her confession, but she talked about black dogs, hogs, a yellow bird, red and black rats, cats, a fox and a wolf. Tituba talked about riding sticks to different places. She confessed that Sarah Osborne possessed a creature with the head of a woman, two legs, and wings. Since it mixed various perspectives on witchcraft, Tituba's confession confused listeners, and its similarities to certain stock tropes of demonology caused some Salem Village residents to believe that Satan was among them. After the trials, Tituba remained in jail because Samuel Parris refused to pay her jail fees. In April of 1693, Tituba was sold to an unknown person for the price of her jail fees. In an interview with Robert Calef for his collection of papers on the trials, titled More Wonders of the Invisible World: Being an Account of the Tryals of Several Witches, Lately Executed in New-England, Tituba confirmed that Parris had beaten a confession out of her and then coached her in what to say and how to say when first questioned. Fiction Tituba, as portrayed in the 19th century by artist Alfred Fredericks in W.C. Bryant's A Popular History of the United States The majority of fictional pieces that artistically or historically depict Tituba's life portray her as an \\"other\\" or an \\"outgroup\\" by Puritan society, due to her racial and socioeconomic status as a South American Native Indigenous and an indentured servant woman. Although it is not explicitly discussed in all of the movies, plays and books, that account for Tituba's conviction, it is quite possible that the \\"fear of strangers\\" in combination with the Western European traditional belief and understanding of witchcraft, made Tituba a prime target for witchcraft conviction. With reference to the historical understanding of Tituba and why she was convicted, it has been argued that the pre-existing ideas about \\"out groups\\" and stereotypical ideas of foreign cultures combined with fictional portrayals of witchcraft and sorcery works, has created a case where history and fiction shape each other. Essentially, the fictional works have assisted in the idea of what the Salem Witch Trials were like and what events lead to the convictions, trials and confessions, but without factoring in racial, political, religious and economic influences of the time, the portrayals of Tituba in media remain, for the most part, fictional. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, in his 1868 play entitled Giles Corey of the Salem Farms, describes Tituba as \\"the daughter of a man all black and fierce‚Ä¶He was an Obi man, and taught [her] magic.\\" Obeah (also spelled Obi) is a specifically African and Afro-American system of magic.\\"Hansen, Chadwick. \\"The Metamorphosis of Tituba, or Why American Intellectuals Can't Tell a Native Witch from a Negro\\", The New England Quarterly 47 (March 1974), pp. 3‚Äì12. Tituba is featured prominently in the 1953 play The Crucible by Arthur Miller. The image of Tituba as the instigator of witchcraft at Salem was reinforced by the opening scene of The Crucible, which owes much to Marion L. Starkey's historical work The Devil in Massachusetts (1949). In Miller's play, Tituba is said to have come from Barbados, where she was taught how to conjure up spirits, and had allegedly dabbled in sorcery, witchcraft, and Satanism. The play suggests that Abigail Williams and the other girls tried to use Tituba's knowledge when dancing in the woods before the trials began; it was, in fact, their being caught that led to those events. With the original intention of covering up their own sinful deeds, Tituba was the one to be accused by Abigail, who had in fact drunk from a magic cup Tituba made to kill John Proctor's wife, Elizabeth, and to bewitch him into loving her. She and the other girls claimed to have seen Tituba \\"with the Devil\\". It is ironic that the belief that Tituba led these girls astray has persisted in popular lore, fiction and non fiction alike. The charge, which is seen by some as having barely disguised racist undertones, is based on the imagination of authors like Starkey, who mirrors Salem's accusers when she asserts that \\"I have invented the scenes with Tituba .... but they are what I really believe happened.\\" Tituba is also the main character in the 1956 book Tituba of Salem Village by Ann Petry. Written for children 10 and up, it portrays Tituba as a black West Indian woman who tells stories about life in Barbados to the village girls. These stories are mingled with existing superstitions and half- remembered pagan beliefs on the part of Puritans (for instance, it is a white neighbor who makes the witch cake, rather than Tituba herself), and the witchcraft hysteria is partly attributed to a sort of cabin fever during a particularly bitter winter. Tituba is the subject of the award-winning novel I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem (1986) by Maryse Cond√©, a novel version of Tituba's life which creates a biography for her, beginning and ending in Barbados, and including supernatural elements. Tituba appears in the novel Calligraphy of the Witch (2007) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba as an Arawak Native American Indigenous from Guyana fluent in several languages, and the only person in the Boston area who understands Spanish. She is a friend and English tutor to the indentured servant Concepci√≥n Benavidez who is accused of witchcraft in the Boston area because of her Mexican and Catholic culture. Tituba is also featured as a main character played by Ashley Madekwe on WGN's television series Salem (2013). In American Horror Story: Coven (2013‚Äì2014), young African-American witch Queenie states that she is a descendant of Tituba. Later in the series, Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau and Supreme witch Fiona Goode have an in-depth discussion of Tituba's history and legacy. They suggest her magic came from her Arawak ancestry. Tituba appears in role in mobile game Fate/Grand Order's \\"Heretical Salem\\" storyline, though in the game she is the slave of a character named Randolph Carter rather than Samuel Parris. She is sentenced to death by the English witch-hunter Matthew Hopkins and executed by hanging. Later it is revealed that the Tituba encountered by the player is not the historical version, but the reincarnated spirit of the biblical Queen of Sheba, summoned and bound to the role in a form of magically-enabled reenactment of the Salem witch trials.

In addition to those three, a large Chumash village was located just north of Arroyo Conejo Open Space by Wildwood Regional Park. Other nearby villages include Lalimanux (Lalimanuc or Lalimanuh) at the base of the Conejo Grade by westernmost Newbury Park, as well as Kay…®w…®≈° or Kayiwish (Kawyis) (CA-Ven-243) also by the Conejo Grade. This region contains numerous pictographs.Maxwell, Thomas J. (1982). The Temescals of Arroyo Conejo. California Lutheran College. Page 93. Library of Congress Catalog Number 82-072788. Newbury Park contains many ancient burial sites, most near the Santa Monica Mountains in the southern portion of the community. Many burial items have been discovered in the area, most notably by Rancho Sierra Vista in southern Newbury Park. Satwiwa, which is Chumash for \\"the bluffs\\", was the name of a nearby village by the Big Sycamore Canyon. The canyon was a popular trading route for the Chumash- and Tongva people, connecting the Conejo Valley to Mugu Lagoon through the Santa Monica Mountains.Straus, Naomi (2004). Let's Go California 10th Edition. Macmillan. p. 474, .

These are known as CA-Ven-65, CA-Ven-261, and CA-Ven-260 near the Fieldhouse in Newbury Park.

Library of Congress Catalog Number 82-072788. Replica of a Chumash house ('ap) at the Tri-Village Complex at Stagecoach Inn. The Venture√±o Chumash initially settled in the west end of the Santa Monica Mountains because of the abundant food supply. Roots, berries, seeds, bulbs, acorns and walnuts were plentiful in the region, and a variety of wildlife including birds, deer and squirrels made for good hunting. Shellfish and fish were transported from the nearby Mugu Lagoon across the Santa Monicas. Here they also discovered an abundance of jackrabbits and other rabbit species, which were hunted widely for fur and meat. At one point, the Chumash here gathered a group of 27 men and killed hundreds of rabbits during a rabbit round-up, which was a significant event of late summers in the Conejo Valley.Maxwell, Thomas J. (1982). The Temescals of Arroyo Conejo. California Lutheran College. Pages 78. Library of Congress Catalog Number 82-072788. Along with Rancho Sierra Vista, various Chumash artifacts from these older settlements, along with petroglyphs, have been found along the Arroyo Conejo, particularly in the Santa Monica Mountains.Ciolek-Torrello, Richard (2006).

The Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center and the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park have displays built around some of these finds, as does the Chumash Indian Museum in Thousand Oaks. In partnership with Friends of Satwiwa, the National Park Service began talks of establishing the current Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center and Natural Area in 1978. Boney Mountain in southern Newbury Park is now a sacred site for the Chumash, and nearby Satwiwa is frequently used by the Chumash Barbare√±o-Venture√±o Band of Mission Indians for private events such as traditional dances and sacred ceremonies.Kennedy, Frances H.

Russell Dean & Company, pg. 121; Newbury Park is named after its founder, Egbert Starr Newbury, who owned thousands of acres of land in the Conejo Valley and later became the first postmaster. E.S. Newbury, Howard Mills, and John Edwards were among the first to buy former Rancho El Conejo land in the early 1870s. El Rancho Conejo was an area which today encompasses most of the Conejo Valley and was named for its many rabbits. Its name derives from a Spanish land grant in California, encouraged by the Spanish- and Mexican governments.Pryor, Alton (2014). The Mexican Land Grants of California. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. . Newbury and his wife Fannie moved to California from Michigan of health reasons in 1871. He later became the first postmaster in the Conejo Valley in 1875. The post office was near their house which was located at the current location of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. E.S. Newbury purchased 2,200 acres of land in 1874, which stretched from today's old town Thousand Oaks and into Hidden Valley in southern Newbury Park.Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne (2010). Conejo Valley (Images of America). Arcadia Publishing, pg. 13; Newbury Park is named for its founder, Egbert Starr Newbury.Begun, Ruthanne and Miriam Sprankling (2004).

North American Book Dist LLC, pg. 350; Conejo Hotel at Timberville, 1880s. In the 1870s, Egbert S. Newbury and his wife Fannie moved full-time to their ranch in Conejo Valley which they named \\"Newbury Park\\" because the land looked so much like a park community.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 7. .Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 40. . It consisted of his house, barn, and a guest house for visitors to \\"enjoy the healthful climate\\", according to E.S. Newbury. The area was remote and only five families lived in the Conejo Valley at the time, all on large ranch lands. The ranches were miles apart and there were no grocery stores, medical facilities, schools, or churches in the valley.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 37. . Newbury had acres of wheat and owned thousands of sheep. The weather had a great impact on his health, and he wrote to his sister Kittie in Michigan on November 23, 1874: ¬´take wings and come to Conejo and enjoy our warm bright days all winter‚Ä¶ be outdoors instead of confined indoors‚Ä¶ I am out all the time and our drives now are just lovely with the country all turning green. The birds stay around our house in flocks all the time‚Ä¶ Our roads to the ranch are splendid and they lie through beautiful canyons and large groves of live and white oak and sycamore, then into an open valley with slopes and surrounding hills covered with evergreen oaks‚Ä¶¬ª.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pp. 38‚Äì39; Timber School in the 1890s, Newbury Park's first school. Sign near Newbury Park Post Office, 1909. As a result of the increasing interest in the developing Conejo Valley, Newbury functioned as a public relations representative for the Conejo Valley. On December 25, 1875, E.S. Newbury wrote in the largest newspaper in Ventura County at the time, the Ventura Signal, the following words about Newbury Park: ¬´Next to Ojai and Santa Ana ranchos, the Conejo mountain valley has the best reputation as a health resort. It is well fifteen miles from Port Hueneme. The soil is immensely fertile, producing large crops of wheat and other grain‚Ä¶¬ª.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pg. 42; Before Newbury Park existed, the Grand Union Hotel provided a stopover for travelers that dates back to 1876.Schroeder, Anne (2000). Branches on the Conejo: Leaving the Soil After Five Generations. Russell Dean & Company. Page 25. . The hotel was operated as a health- and pleasure resort,Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pg. 46; and provided a rest stop for stagecoach passengers and a gathering place for residents in Newbury Park.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications, pg. 26; The Conejo Valley pioneers were living in rugged individualism, where travelers had to make their journey over the Conejo Grade or Norwegian Grade to reach Camarillo where they could buy groceries. Newbury Park was an older settlement than Thousand Oaks, where people had settled wedged between Borchard lands on the south and Friedrich land on the north. The residents of the Conejo Valley had to travel to Oxnard for high school, burials or for marriages.Schroeder, Anne (2000). Branches on the Conejo: Leaving the Soil After Five Generations. Russell Dean & Company, pp. 85-86; Painting of the Newbury home, 1870s. The tent held Conejo Valley's first Post Office.O'Brien, Tricia (2017). Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village (Images of America). Arcadia Publishing. Page 9. . As inhabitants of the valley had to travel to San Buenaventura (Ventura, CA) to get their mail, E.S. Newbury took the initiative to establish a local post office and applied to Washington, D.C. On July 16, 1875, the Newbury Park Post Office was established with E.S. Newbury as its first postmaster.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pg 41; The Conejo School District was established in March 1877. At the time, the population was 126 in the Conejo Valley.Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pg. 48; E.S. Newbury and other residents of the Conejo Valley were unprepared for the 1876‚Äì78 drought. There were only six inches of rain in 30 months. The drought devastated Newbury Park and the valley. With no rain, the crops died and natural grasses as well, which were food for the ranchers' sheep. Egbert went bankrupt and decided to move with his family in 1877, and rode with his wagon and family back to Michigan where he ultimately settled in Detroit. On September 28, 1878, the land Egbert once called \\"Newbury Park\\" was sold at a sheriff's sale. The post office remained its original name,Begun, Ruthanne (2006). The Newburys of Newbury Park. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pp. 49‚Äì50; despite having moved from its original destination, which is why Newbury Park has its name today. =Modern history= Casa Conejo is the oldest planned development in town. It is an unincorporated county island which is part of Newbury Park, but not Thousand Oaks. Newbury Park was a more established and older community than Thousand Oaks at the beginning of the 20th century.Schroeder, Anne (2000). Branches on the Conejo: Leaving the Soil After Five Generations. Russell Dean & Company, pg. 86; In the early 20th century, Newbury Park had a few ranches and stores, wedged between Borchard lands to the south and Friedrich land on the north. During the 1940s, Ventu Park behind Newbury Park's main street became a 500-acre real estate development. Lots sold to movie stars and others seeking a rustic retreat. One of the male members of the New York Rothschilds built a large home by Ventu Park and lived in relative seclusion here in the 1940s. Prior to the 1960s, Newbury Park was never incorporated as its own city or municipality, it was unincorporated areas of Ventura County with little development. During the 1950s there were speculations persisting that Ventura County officials refused to allow Newbury Park to expand because of a feud with the would-be developers. Between 1950 and 1970, the Conejo Valley experienced a population boom, and increased its population from 3,000 to 30,000.McCormack, Don (2000). Santa Barbara and Ventura 2001. Mccormacks Guides, pg. 116; Twin Ponds in Dos Vientos. Newbury Park as seen from atop Angel Vista (1,603 ft), reached from the Rosewood Trail. Many Newbury Park residents did not want to be part of Thousand Oaks, and many residents fought to stop the incorporation in fear of losing the Newbury Park identity. Newbury Park had made failed attempts at creating its own municipality in the early 1960s, not only to create its own city, but to also remain independent of Thousand Oaks. A 1963 attempt at a cityhood election failed when the Janss's Rancho Conejo Industrial Park and the Talley Corporation refused to join the efforts. Activist Reba Hays Jeffries of the Stagecoach Inn had a different explanation for interviewers when addressing why efforts at an independent municipality failed. She claimed the cityhood supporters were required to collect signatures from owners who represented 29% of the land area in Newbury Park. As the efforts collected signatures from 29% of registered voters, and not Newbury Park landowners, the petition never appeared on the ballot.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications, pg. 54; Reba M.H. Jeffries was one of several opponents to the idea of annexation when it was first proposed in 1967. Jeffries feared for the identity of Newbury Park and was quoted in an interview saying: \\"It's a shame that the Thousand Oaks personality is overpowering to the extent that Newbury Park is losing its large ranches and freedom.\\" Jeffries was also opposed to the proposition to demolish the Stagecoach Inn in 1964, and fought to keep the Newbury Park Post Office in town.Begun, Miriam and Ruthanne Sprankling (2009). Ladies of The Conejo. Conejo Valley Historical Society, pp. 93‚Äì94; Amgen Tour of California has returned to Newbury Park five times. The City of Thousand Oaks was formally established on September 29, 1964, and throughout the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, most Newbury Park land was annexed by the City of Thousand Oaks. The annexed area was formerly controlled by Ventura County, but as of 2016, all but Casa Conejo and Ventu Park is within Thousand Oaks city limits. Together with Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park was part of a master planned community by the Janss Investment Company. Newbury Park has had an increasing population due to the presence of biotechnology firms and technology corporations, such as Amgen (world headquarters) and Baxter, and other high- technology corporations.Hauf, Tim (2001). Ventura County: A Photographic Perspective. Tim Hauf Photography, pg. 48; . President George W. Bush visited the Newbury Park High School and the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center in 2003.Spada, James (2004). The Bush Family: Four Generations of History in Photographs. Macmillan, pg. 218; Housing alt= The community contains two major new residential areas, Rancho Conejo Village (built on the site of the former Rancho Conejo Airport, where portions of the film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World were filmed) and Dos Vientos Ranch. The first planned community in Newbury Park was Casa Conejo, located in a roughly square-shaped unincorporated area. Geography alt= Newbury Park can be described as a town, community,Strong, Kathy (2011). Southern California Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places. Rowman & Littlefield. Page 42. . or section mostly within the Thousand Oaks city limits in addition to rural areas west of Thousand Oaks. Newbury Park is bordered by Lynn Road in the east and the Conejo Grade on the west. It borders the Santa Monica Mountains in the south, while Hill Canyon and the ridges of Conejo Canyons Open Space make up its northernmost area. It has an average elevation of above sea level, and is situated from the Pacific Ocean. Newbury Park is west of Los Angeles. It is situated in the southeastern corner of Ventura County, between the Santa Monica Mountains to the south, and protected nature areas such as Wildwood Regional Park to the north. Thousand Oaks proper is to the east and the city of Camarillo is down the Conejo Grade to the west. Newbury Park is made up of ZIP code 91320; however, certain post office boxes by Newbury Road use ZIP code 91319. Compared to eastern part of Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park remains a significantly more rural community which includes for equestrian areas. The recreational areas accessible from U.S. Highway 101 include the Los Padres and Angeles National Forests. Being located less than six miles from the Los Angeles County line, Newbury Park is in the northwestern part of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Newbury Park is both a benefactor and a victim of the modern-day freeway development. It is a planned community, which originally solely functioned as a bedroom community. In recent times, however, Newbury Park has attracted numerous high-tech industries, keeping many of its former commuters home. Newbury Park has three freeway exits on U.S. Route 101 (the Ventura Freeway). It can also be reached by crossing through the Santa Monica Mountains from the coast. The main road (Potrero Road) through Hidden Valley leads into Newbury Park. There are numerous trailheads including one into the Santa Monica Mountains that leads to the coast. There are also trailheads to Wildwood Regional Park with trails to other portions of Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. The unincorporated county islands of Casa Conejo, Ventu Park and Kelley Estates are within Newbury Park. Street sign colors vary from unincorporated areas and areas incorporated into Thousand Oaks. alt= =Climate= While the Conejo Valley is generally cooler than the San Fernando and Simi Valleys, the temperature remains temperate year-long in Newbury Park. The region has a mild, year-round Mediterranean climate or Dry- Summer Subtropical zone climate, with warm, sunny, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Vegetation is typical of Mediterranean environments, with chaparral and grasses on the hillsides and numerous western valley oaks. Its elevation ranges from about (excluding hills). The area has slightly cooler temperatures than the surrounding areas, as it receives cooler air from the ocean through various hill and mountain passes. Annual rainfall averages about ten inches in Newbury Park, while the humidity averages 52 percent. The temperature ranges from 55 to 77 degrees, and tends to be cooler than in neighboring Thousand Oaks. There are typically at least a few days per year with lows below freezing, occasionally falling into the upper 20s. On February 21, 2019, snow fell on the peak of Boney Mountain. Snow falls on the mountain approximately once every 10 years, previously occurring on December 17, 2008. =Cityscape= Newbury Park and Amgen seen from Wildwood Regional Park. The physiography consists of prominent knolls, open vistas, surrounding mountains, and native oak woodland. It is characterized by its many rolling green hills. Businesses are centered on both sides of Ventura Freeway, which bisects the community. A number of businesses can for instance be found on Newbury Road, which is named after Egbert Starr Newbury, the founder of Newbury Park.Begun, Miriam and Ruthanne Sprankling (2009). Ladies of The Conejo. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 133. . The industrial area is centered around Rancho Conejo in northern Newbury Park, where corporations such as Amgen, Anthem Blue Cross, DesignworksUSA and Shire (formerly Baxalta) are located. Hotels in Newbury Park include Palm Garden Hotel, La Quinta Inn & Suites, Courtyard by Marriott, and Hampton Inn & Suites. The prominent 2,880 ft. Boney Mountain dominates the Newbury Park horizon from almost any angle. Newbury Park is bounded by Malibu Coast AVA in the south, home of wineries such as SIP Malibu Grapes, Cornell Winery, and Malibu Family Wines. =Natural hazards= Thomas Fire behind Conejo Mountain, seen from Newbury Park on Dec. 6, 2017. Some of the natural hazards include wildfires, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, landslides and erosion. The Conejo Valley is relatively often the victim of earthquakes, including the major 1994 Northridge earthquake.Bolin, Robert and Lois Stanford (2006). The Northridge Earthquake: Vulnerability and Disaster. Routledge. Page 154. . Along with most of Southern California, droughts are prevalent. The major drought of 1876‚Äì1878, with only six inches of rain in thirty months, devastated Newbury Park and forced its founder, Egbert Starr Newbury, to leave the area. Two large fires have seriously threatened Newbury Park in recent years. The Springs Fire started just west of Newbury Park, right off the U.S. 101 freeway, on May 2, 2013. It burned large portions of many of the hills and mountains surrounding the town, but no structures were lost in Newbury Park due to aggressive firefighting efforts. This fire was extinguished four days later, thanks to an unusual rainstorm falling in the area.https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/special- reports/outdoors/2018/05/02/springs-fire-blackened-bare-hillsides-drought- california-wildfire-mugu-wildflowers-santa-monica/546906002/ The Hill Fire and Woolsey Fire were separate fires which began within 23 minutes of one another on November 8, 2018. Both threatened many homes in Newbury Park, and while the Hill Fire was contained fairly quickly, the Woolsey fire rapidly got worse and destroyed large areas of southern California. Most of Newbury Park was evacuated for 2‚Äì3 days during these fires. Local schools were closed for 2 weeks, for the purpose of repair of smoke damage. No structures in Newbury Park were lost, partially due to aggressive firefighting, and also due to previous burn from the 2013 Springs Fire stopping the spread in that direction.https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/11/09/brush-fire-newbury-park- santa-rosa/https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2019/01/28/investigator- finds-power-lines-likely-fault-newbury-park-fire/2575497002/ These fires started just 15 hours after the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, thus making it the most difficult day in the city's history.https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2018/11/09/ventura-hill- woolsey-fire-california-thousand-oaks-shooting/1942036002/ Newbury Park was also affected by the massive Thomas Fire of December 2017, and a smoke advisory was issued by the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. Subsequently, all public schools were closed on December 6, 2017. An additional 3-acre brush fire, nicknamed the Runner Fire, broke out behind the headquarters of Amgen and Shire (Baxalta) on December 5. Both Amgen and nearby Sage Publishing decided to evacuate their employees due to thick smoke. The fire had a potential of reaching Hill Canyon due to the warm Santa Ana winds, but was contained before causing major damage or injuries. =Geology= Newbury Park is the westernmost community in the Conejo Valley, which is located in southern Ventura County. It is a broad, wide, and high-lying incline, with an average elevation of 900 feet above sea level. It is bordered by the steep ridge-lines of the Santa Monica Mountains to the south and southeast, Conejo Mountains to the west and north (including the Conejo Grade in westernmost Newbury Park), and the Simi Hills to the northeast. While the Oxnard Plain and the community of Camarillo are immediately to the west, the Santa Rosa Valley is beyond the Conejo Mountains or through Hill Canyon to the north. Beyond the Santa Monica's to the south is the Pacific Ocean, while the San Fernando Valley is beyond the valley's eastern ridges. The physiography is characterized by open vistas, high peaks, creeks and creek-beds, prominent knolls, and native oak woodlands. Along with the Santa Rosa-, Tierra Rejada- and Simi Valleys, the Conejo Valley is also drained by tributaries of the Calleguas Creek. Its principal tributary, Arroyo Conejo, flows through Newbury Park in a southwesterly direction before discharging into the Pacific Ocean by the Mugu Lagoon.Edwards, Ronald D. (1970). Soil survey, Ventura area, California. U.S. Soil Conservation Service, pg. 142. View of Conejo Mountain (center), Camarillo (left) and Newbury Park (right). =Wildlife= Adjacent to Mountain lion habitat in the Santa Monica Mountains to the south and Wildwood Regional Park to the north, lions are relatively frequently observed in Newbury Park. Being surrounded by open-space wilderness areas and wildlife corridors to both the south and north, the town is home to an abundance of wildlife. Compared to neighboring City of Thousand Oaks, which consists of nearly 50% developed area, Newbury Park remains a significantly more rural community than its counterpart to the east. Approximately 928 of the 63,000 acres compromising the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is located within Newbury Park. It is recognized as the largest urban national park in the United States and is a California wildlife preserve.Brubaker, Jill (1991). Wildlife California. Chronicle Junior Nature Series. Page 3. . Rancho Sierra Vista in southern Newbury Park is one of the primary park units and functions as a crucial Southern California wildlife-corridor.Butcher, Russel D. (1999). Guide to National Parks: Pacific Region. Globe Pequot. Page 91. . Wildlife in the southern edge of town is therefore incredibly abundant, and includes animals such as black bears, eagles, porcupines, deer, prairie wolves, rabbits, falcons, bobcats, foxes, hawks, and more.Riedel, Monique Del (2009). Best Easy Day Hikes Ventura. Falcon Guides. Page 49. .Brubaker, Jill (1991). Wildlife California. Chronicle Books. Pages 2‚Äì3. . The National Park Service estimates a population of 10‚Äì15 Mountain lions inhabiting the Santa Monica Mountains as of 2015, in addition to mountain lions living permanently in Wildwood Regional Park which borders the town to the north.Maxwell, Thomas J. (2000). Hiking In Wildwood Regional Park: Natural History, Folklore, and Trail Guide. California Lutheran University (CLU). Page 138. As a result of bordering numerous wilderness areas, there are few dangers presented for the mountain lion, which is consequentially not a threatened species in the area.Riedel, Allen (2011). Best Easy Day Hikes Conejo Valley. Falcon Guides. Page 3. . Because of their large habitat and few dangers, lions are relatively often creating a hazard in suburban areas of Newbury Park. The mountain lion is not the only mammal threatening both inhabitants and their pets, but outdoor dogs and cats are often prey for an increasing number of coyotes, bobcats, and owls. An increasing number of snake species in suburban areas have also recently been recorded and poses a threat to people and pets as well. Other animals posing potential danger includes venomous spiders and scorpions, most notably the Stripe-tailed scorpion.Bachleda, F. Lynne (2002). Dangerous Wildlife in California & Nevada: A Guide to Safe Encounters At Home and in the Wild. Menasha Ridge Press. Pages 118‚Äì123. . Tarantulas, scorpions and the potentially lethal Black Widow Spider all make their habitat in Wildwood Regional Park.Maxwell, Thomas J. (2000). Hiking In Wildwood Regional Park: Natural History, Folklore, and Trail Guide. California Lutheran University (CLU). Pages 153‚Äì154. Mammals more frequently encountered than the Mountain lion include the Valley coyote, Bobcat, Mule deer, Gray fox, Desert cottontail, Virginia opossum, California raccoon, Long-tailed weasel, American badger and the Striped skunk. Other species of mammals include the Ring-tailed cat, Spotted skunk, Botta's pocket gopher, Brush rabbit, Broad-footed mole, California vole, Ornate shrew, and three species of squirrel: the California ground squirrel, Western gray squirrel, and Fox squirrel. Mice and rats include the California pocket mouse, House mouse, Western harvest mouse, Deer Mouse, Agile kangaroo rat, Pack rat, Dusky-footed woodrat, and the Brown- and Black rat. There are eleven recorded species of bats. Amphibians include the Blackbelly salamander, Ensatina, Western skink, and numerous toad- and frog species: California toad, American bullfrog, California treefrog and Pacific treefrog. The Western pond turtle is an endemic species to the Arroyo Conejo and other creeks. Newbury Park is home to an abundance of reptiles, including lizards such as the Western fence lizard, Coast horned lizard, Common side- blotched lizard, Southern alligator lizard, Teiidae and the California legless lizard. There are eleven species of snake recorded in the Greater Thousand Oaks Area: Southern Pacific rattlesnake, Ring-necked snake, Western yellowbelly racer, California whipsnake, Coachwhip, Gopher snake, California kingsnake, Two-striped garter snake, Western Black-headed Snake, Lyre snake, and Night snake. Thousand Oaks proper is home to 171 recorded species of birds, including seventeen raptors such as the Barn owl, Cooper's hawk, American kestrel, Prairie falcon, Red-shouldered hawk, Golden eagle, Great horned owl, White-tailed kite, California vulture, Northern harrier, Sharp- shinned hawk, Ferruginous hawk, Merlin and Screech owl. Commonly encountered bird species include the House sparrow, House finch, Brewer's blackbird, Common raven, California towhee, Acorn woodpecker, California quail, and the Red-tailed hawk. Demographics According to the U.S. Census 2010, 76.81% of the population identify as White, 10.72% Asian-American, 1.88% African- American, 0.09% Native-American, and 6.78% claim 'other'. 19.18% of the people in Newbury Park claim Hispanic ethnicity or heritage. As of 2005, only the community of Newbury Park, not including Thousand Oaks, had a median household income of $83,615. For Thousand Oaks as a whole according to the 2005 US Census Bureau, the median household income was $108,120, while median family income was $110,885. According to Money Magazine, median family income as of 2006 was up to $119,207, which is substantially higher than both the California median income and U.S. median household income of $64,585. The median house value is $678,400. Economy Amgen is headquartered in Newbury Park and is the world's largest biotechnology firm. Agriculture was the only industry present in Newbury Park for many decades, and dominated the economy until the 1950s.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications. Page 111. . Today, most of the community is part of the City of Thousand Oaks, whose economy is based on a small range of businesses, with biotechnology, electronics, automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, healthcare, and financing occupying most of Thousand Oaks' employment sector. After the incorporation of large parts of Newbury Park, the City of Thousand Oaks helped revitalize sections of Newbury Park through the former Redevelopment Agency.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications. Page 159. . The global headquarters of biotechnology firm Amgen, DesignworksUSA, as well as the industrial design and styling department of BMW are located in the community, as are offices for Anthem Blue Cross, Sage Publications, and Skyworks Solutions. Amgen has its headquarters in Newbury Park, and is the world's largest biotech company as well as the largest employer in the Conejo Valley.Baker, Pam (2002). Thousand Oaks Westlake Village: A Contemporary Portrait. Community Communications, Inc. Page 37. . Founded in 1980, Amgen now employs nearly 7,000, and has attracted hundreds of scientists to the Newbury Park area. Focused on the cutting edge of molecular biology and biochemistry, its goal is to provide a healthcare business based on recombinant DNA technology.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications. Pages 128‚Äì129. . Besides Amgen, other major employers include Shire (formerly Baxalta), Baxter Bio Science, Wellpoint Blue Cross, Skyworks Solutions Inc., and many more. Hewlett-Packard was previously located here.Chalquist, Craig (2008). Deep California: Images and Ironies of Cross and Sword on El Camino Real. Craig Chalquist. Page 279. .Allen, Patricia A. (1978). Janss: A Brief History. Janss Recognition Committee. Page 18. Particularly during and after the 1960s, the area started to attract large corporations, biotechnology firms, and other high-technology industries. As a result of the steadily increasing number of high-technology industries in the area, Newbury Park has been dubbed \\"the next Silicon Valley\\". =Industry= DesignworksUSA is headquartered in Rancho Conejo, and recognized as one of the ten best consultancies in the world.Jacobus, John L. (2013). The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild: An Illustrated History. McFarland. Page 180. . Northern Newbury Park, which had been land owned by the Janss Corporation since 1916, was zoned industrial and an industrial park started to appear here in 1954. A number of industries soon followed Talley Corporation's 1954 move to Rancho Conejo, including Packard Bell, Westland Plastics and Technology Institute Corporation in 1960. Westinghouse Corporation moved to Rancho Conejo Industrial Park in 1961, while Northrop Ventura and North American Science Center moved here in 1963. Capitol Records opened its mail order center for all record club memberships in 1968, while Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was planning to build a $30 million movie studio here in the late 1960s.Needham, Beth (1990).

The character is known for his \\"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\\" catchphrase. Alpha 5 has been physically portrayed by multiple actors: Romy J. Sharf, Sandi Sellner and Donene Kistler in the TV series, and Peta-Maree Rixon in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. Richard Steven Horvitz voiced Alpha 5 for the character's appearances in most Power Ranger franchise media, starting from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television series until Power Rangers Turbo, which marked the character's final appearance in the Power Rangers TV series. In the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character voiced by Bill Hader. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the Power Rangers franchise. Character overview Alpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the Power Rangers in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers' technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents. He is best known for his signature catchphrase, \\"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\\", usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited. Alpha 5's original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of International Business Times as a \\"vintage robot look\\"; his head is shaped like a golden flying saucer, adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking. Another one of the character's visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers' lightning bolt symbol on his chest. The character is depicted as naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers wanting to spend time with them. Creation and development Richard Horvitz, credited as \\"Richard Wood\\" for the Power Rangers series, developed Alpha‚Äôs catchphrase when the series was in development. Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5's future successor, Alpha 7, in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode Forever Red. Romy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series as well as the Alpha‚Äôs Magical Christmas holiday special. Sandi Sellner took over the role for 19 episodes when the Power Rangers gained ninja-themed powers in season 3. Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5's appearances in the series. Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5's successor, Alpha 6, for Power Rangers Turbo and Power Rangers In Space. Appearances =In Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers= Alpha 5 debuted in the first episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed Green Ranger to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a force field, but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \\"Singing Squash\\" to undo a spell placed on Kimberly and Billy. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash. In the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In The Wannabe Ranger, he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self- destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers to do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and Goldar, but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in The Wedding, he was ambushed by Finster and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal. In the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the Andromeda constellation by King Lexian, the grandfather of the Masked Rider. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode. =In Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers= Alpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by Rito and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion. =In Power Rangers Zeo= Alpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the Power Chamber. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the Power Rangers Zeo) as they battled the Machine Empire. A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears. =In Power Rangers Turbo= When Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in Shift Into Turbo), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in Passing of the Torch, in which Tommy, Adam, Kat, and Tanya retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the Power Rangers series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \\"The Robot Ranger\\". Reception Alpha 5 is noted as a \\"beloved\\" and \\"lovable\\" comic relief character of the Power Rangers franchise by various sources. Joe Anderton from Digital Spy opined that while Alpha 5 looked like he was \\"made out of whatever props they could find\\", to him the character's \\"goofy little walk and head tilt made him feel human and relatable, as if those blinking red lights were eyes\\". Jessica Lachenal from The Mary Sue thought Alpha 5's appearance, which resembled a Geordi La Forge- style visor which light up whenever he speaks, was \\"adorable\\" and \\"endearing\\". In other media =Movies= Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie  Peta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. Like the film's other character costumes, the Alpha 5 suit Rixon donned was specifically designed for the movie. Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie In Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, Alpha gains a new, streamlined body. His plating appears to be more reflective, and his lightning bolt was now an arrow pointing straight down. Power Rangers (2017 film) Power Rangers. In the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character portrayed by Bill Hader. Hader acted out Alpha 5's movements in a motion-capture suit, and provides the voiced dialogue for the character in the recording booth. To promote the film, Lionsgate launched a \\"chat bot\\" app, which features a completely personalized, spontaneous chat with Alpha 5. The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction. The film's iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio- mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design's red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor. Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, he has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers. Alpha 5's drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it \\"weird\\", \\"horrifying\\", or \\"nightmarish\\". The Los Angeles Times and International Business Times both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5's redesign. Phillip Martinez dissented and thought that the redesign, though jarring, matched the visual language of the film's Power Rangers iteration. The decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists. Jacob Stolworthy from The Independent considered the casting to be \\"odd\\". Joshua Rivera from GQ Magazine expressed his concerns about the film's creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5's \\"classic high-pitched fretting\\", Alpha 6's \\"weirdly nasal Long Island stylings\\", or if he would approach the role as the \\"latest Stefon joint\\". Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for The New York Times, commented that \\"Hader's dialed-down take\\" of the character \\"reflects the movie's tempered refinement of the original\\". =Alpha's Magical Christmas= Alpha 5 is the main character of Alpha's Magical Christmas, a direct-to-video musical Christmas special produced during Season 2 of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The Rangers are away at the North Pole assisting Santa Claus in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon's presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a Christmas tree to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as \\"Good King Wenceslas\\", \\"Deck the Halls\\", \\"Here We Come A-Caroling\\", \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Silent Night\\". After the children leave via the \\"magical portal\\", Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" to end the special. =Comics= Alpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic series, published by Boom! Studios. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film. Promotion and merchandise Like many Power Rangers series characters, various merchandise has been made of Alpha 5 since the inception of the franchise.

Founded in 1907 by Frederick William Plaxton, it became a subsidiary of Alexander Dennis in May 2007. Since 2019, the maker is currently owned by Canadian bus manufacturer New Flyer. History G-Line Holidays Plaxton Elite bodied Volvo B9R in June 2011 =Beginnings= The business was founded as a joinery workshop, and expanded into building contracting. As a building contractor, Plaxtons built a number of notable buildings in Scarborough. Soon after World War I Plaxtons diversified and began to build charabanc bodies on Ford Model T chassis. Of more importance at the time was the construction of automobile bodywork. This included bodywork for Rolls- Royce, Sunbeam and Daimler, but principally for Crossley car chassis. This activity continued through the 1920s, but the depression of 1929-1933 created difficulties for manufacture of luxury automobiles. As a result, the manufacture of charabanc, and later coach bodies became more important through the late 1920s and early 1930s. Customers during this time tended to be local to the Scarborough area, Scarborough being a popular seaside resort. =Coaches of the 1930s= By 1936 the company felt justified in constructing a large new manufacturing facility in Seamer Road, Scarborough. This allowed increased production, and Plaxtons became popular with many independent operators throughout Northern England. Many of these operators purchased their vehicles through independent dealers, rather than directly from the factory. In this regard, Plaxton's sales were through Lancashire Motor Traders Ltd of Manchester and Arlington Motor Co Ltd of London. The company became known as FW Plaxton & Son by 1937, as the founder's son, also named Frederick William joined the company at the age of 18. FW Plaxton junior was to be known as Eric to avoid confusion with his father. Plaxtons built a number of different coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally from the bottom of the front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the \\"bullnose\\" radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal. On the outbreak of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory was turned into a munitions factory under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some adjacent land was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later. =1950s= Production restarted at the end of 1945, and in 1951 the business was registered for the first time as a private company, Plaxtons (Scarborough) Limited.Companies House extract company no 435086 Henlys Group plc formerly Plaxton Group plc formerly Plaxton plc formerly Plaxtons (Scarborough) Limited Two new models were exhibited at the 1950 Commercial Motor Show, with names instead of model codes for the first time. The Envoy was for traditional front-engined chassis, and featured a full-front cab with a vee-pattern windscreen, and aluminium trim across the lower part of the radiator grill extending around squared-off front corners to the wheel arches.Image of ONW 2, a Plaxton Envoy on a Foden PVFE chassis. The Crusader, which could be built on the traditional front-engined chassis or the new underfloor-engined chassis, had a more upright front profile, with curved glass panels at the windscreen corners, and in most cases an enlarged side window with sloping pillars between this and the entrance.Image of NMA 1, a Plaxton Crusader on a Leyland Royal Tiger chassis. With the front-engined chassis, the Crusader employed the Envoy's front trim. Both the Envoy and Crusader were produced to the new maximum dimensions of by , and many examples were originally fitted with rear wheel spats. The Envoy was short-lived, perhaps partly because of the obsolescence of most of the chassis types for which it was intended, while the Crusader was rapidly overtaken by a further new underfloor-engined model ‚Äì the Venturer. The Venturer combined the front of the Crusader with more restrained and conservative styling,Image of EFV 736, a Plaxton Venturer on a Leyland Royal Tiger chassis. and proved so popular that it was not long before a version was produced for front-engined chassis (mostly lightweight Bedfords and Commers) with a rather more raked frontal appearance. By the time the Mark II version appeared at the 1952 show, the Venturer was Plaxton's standard model. The Venturer II had a common front profile for all models, together with a standard dash panel featuring a four- part radiator grille with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps.Image of HCX 213, a Plaxton Venturer II on a Bedford SB chassis. A rear-end revision marked the launch of the Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced for underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical front profile, and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer ‚Äì front engined,Image of HB 8582, a Plaxton Venturer III on a Commer Avenger III chassis. underfloor-engined with a centre entranceImage of 2620 U, a Plaxton Venturer III on an AEC Regal IV chassis. and underfloor-engined with a front entrance.Image of SVO 44, a Plaxton Venturer III on an AEC Reliance chassis. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years. The Consort was first shown at the 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a development of the Venturer, but in place of the previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than the bottom, with the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed brightwork, and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line.Image of WPT 136, a Plaxton Consort on an AEC Reliance chassis. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer ‚Äì but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle - while the trim lines so recently squared up were softened once again.Image of 222 BMB, a Plaxton Consort II on a Bedford SB chassis. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark for many years to come. In 1957 the founder of the company, FW Plaxton Senior, died, and was succeeded as Chairman by his son Frederick Junior, though known as Eric. In 1958, Plaxtons were approached by Sheffield United Tours (SUT) with a requirement for a new crisper design of coach body. The result was the first Panorama body. The main feature of the Panorama design was the large, fixed rectangular side windows. A vertical front from the contemporary Consort II design was used, with the door ahead of the front axle. The 1958 Panorama was entered into the British and the Nice coach rallies, winning top awards at both events. The first six Panoramas, designated \\"Panorama Pioneer\\" by SUT, were built on AEC Reliance chassis and seated 36 passengers.Image of 3285 WB, a Plaxton Panorama on an AEC Reliance chassis. The production version of the Panorama, with 41 seats as standard, was introduced at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show, as an addition to the existing range, available in one form only ‚Äì on underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. In common with the new Consort III and IV, it had a new silver-effect dished oval grill with a chrome flash through the middle, and a curved windscreen with a central division. The original Panorama's short window immediately behind the entrance door was removed and encapsulated into the first bay, and the difference in level between the waistline and the rear window was accommodated by a stylish \\"kick- up\\" at the rear.Image of 129 DPT, a Plaxton Panorama on an AEC Reliance chassis. The design then received minor modifications over the next two years. Consort IV variants with the entrance further back, together with the smaller Consort III, were able to use a windscreen with even greater curvature,Image of 5421 CR, a Plaxton Consort III on a Bedford J4 chassis. but it was the Panorama which was the trend-setter, becoming a strong influence on the development of British coach styling for years to come. =1960s and 1970s= Preserved Embassy bodied Bedford VAS in August 2010 Plaxton became a public company in January 1961. For the 1961 coaching season the Consort IV evolved into the Embassy, the main change being that the windows now tapered inwards towards the roof rather than being vertical. At the same time a new version of the Panorama was created, using the same shell as the Embassy but with fewer window pillars. The new Panorama boasted a completely new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill at the bottom of the front panel, and for the first time double headlights.Image of WRP 999, a Plaxton Panorama on a Leyland Leopard L2 chassis. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position.Image of SHL 917, a Plaxton Embassy on an AEC Reliance chassis. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis - particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and wrap-around windscreen of the Consort IV.Image of 6876 SM, a Plaxton Embassy on a Bedford SB chassis. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece curved glass window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, and the lights were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top rather like the rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.Rear view of ETC 760B, a Plaxton Embassy II on Bedford VAS chassis. versions of both models were introduced, on Leyland Leopard and AEC Reliance chassis, as soon as legislation allowed, and were wide. The first 36-foot coach in Britain was a Panorama delivered to SUT in 1961. However, while the extra length gave a real boost to the Panorama's appearance ‚Äì with the falling roofline making the vehicle look even longer than it actually wasImage of 299 BRP, a Plaxton Panorama on a Leyland Leopard PSU3 chassis. ‚Äì the extension of the Embassy by two additional window bays was less satisfactory.Image of 62 BUA, a Plaxton Embassy on a Leyland Leopard PSU3 chassis. So much so that when a \\"multi-windowed\\" Embassy II, in the livery of Bloomfields Coaches of London, appeared on the newly introduced Bedford VAL 36-foot chassis at the 1962 Commercial Motor Show, the reaction was so negative than no more of this type were built.Townsin 1982, p. 108. Alongside the Bloomfields VAL on the Plaxton stand was a further revised Panorama. This was an altogether much larger looking vehicle than before, with deeper windows all round, the waistline curvature radically reduced to a point where it was almost straight, a new rear window interchangeable with the windscreen, and a reduction in the number of window pillars on 36-foot versions.Image of AWA 346B, a Plaxton Panorama on an AEC Reliance chassis. Because of the adverse reaction to the \\"multi-windowed\\" Embassy, from 1963 all 36-foot Plaxton coach bodies used the new Panorama shell, with windows of large size whether fixed or opening, although, as previously, the Panorama name was restricted to underfloor-engined coaches with fixed glazing and entrance ahead of the front axle. Of the non-Panoramas, by far the most popular model was the new production body on the Bedford VAL chassis, which retained the large oval grill because of the front-mounted radiator, and was simply named Val.Image of BMX 296A, a Plaxton Val on a Bedford VAL chassis. The Embassy name was now being used for what were effectively two separate models. For underfloor- engined chassis there was a 36-foot body using the Panorama shell (built mainly for the Wallace Arnold Group),Image of 109 EUA, a Plaxton Embassy on a Leyland Leopard PSU3 chassis. and for and shorter front-engined chassis the original short-windowed body was updated with a pronounced reverse-rake peak over the windscreen as the Embassy II.Image of 172 DUG, a Plaxton Embassy II on a Bedford SB chassis. For the 1964 season the latter was substantially redesigned as the Embassy III, catching up in several respects with the development of the Panorama, but introducing a new near-rectangular grill which signalled the beginning of the end for the familiar Plaxton oval.Image of JFT 258, a Plaxton Embassy III on a Bedford SB chassis. 1965 Plaxton Panorama on a Bedford VAL chassis The Plaxton coach range which appeared at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first window bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and gave the impression of size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9\\" circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type. For the first time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, including Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first window bay harmonised with the twin steering axles below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.Image of FDT 901C, a Plaxton Panorama on a Bedford SB chassis. In addition to the Panoramas, a more basic series of models was offered, with windows of similar size, but with simpler trim and top sliding vent windows instead of forced air vents. Initially these were built on Bedford and Ford chassis only and named variously as Val, Vam (on the new Bedford VAM chassis) or Embassy IV.Image of EHL 466D, a Plaxton Vam on a Bedford VAM chassis. However, when the Panorama was renamed Panorama I for the 1967 season, the less expensive \\"bread and butter\\" models became available on all chassis types as the Panorama II. The Panorama I in particular sold extremely well. The Panorama cab was used in 1967 on a government commission of seven Bedford SB3 chassis mobile cinema units. With the height of these units being nearly the roof of the cab opens up into a very unusual looking perspex dome extension, somewhat altering the usual sleek lines of Plaxton's Panorama. One of the seven units still remains in preservation, having been restored as a vintage mobile cinema. Plaxton Panorama cab on a Bedford SB3 chassis mobile cinema unit Preserved Plaxton Panorama Elite bodied AEC Reliance in June 2013 Magical Mystery Tour Plaxton Panorama Elite II bodied Bedford VAL in Liverpool in 2004 Malta bus Plaxton Supreme bodied Bedford in March 2010 Barton Transport Plaxton Supreme III bodied Leyland Leopard in Ilkeston in 1993 Plaxton Supreme IV bodied Mercedes-Benz O303 in 1978 Plaxton launched a new design - the Panorama Elite - at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show in London. This essentially set the basic design of British coaches for the next 14 years. The design was stylish, with long sleek lines and gentle curve in the vertical plane. The windows were gasket glazed and the glass gently curved in the vertical plane to suit the body curve. The rear again used the large soup plate lights of the Panorama I, and the front grill was also from the Panorama I. The Panorama II was still available until 1970 with a large batch built for Midland Red. The interior of The new Panorama Elite was to the usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches in front of the driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as the final version of the Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design. The first major update of the Panorama Elite was unveiled at the 1970 Commercial Motor Show in London. The changes though relatively subtle were very relevant to a product that had so far enjoyed wide acclaim and sale. The Panorama Elite II range built on the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up although it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximise on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range. The Panorama Elite III was the last in the Elite series. Improvements continued to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear emergency door and subtle changes to the front grill. The rear emergency door was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The rear lights abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the back to the front just behind the front door. All three marques of the Elite range were available with bus grant specification front doors and interiors, although this option was late for Panorama Elite and only a few built. It was however a very popular option for the Mark II and Mark III. To complement this destination blinds were also available in both the front grille and on the roof or front dome for front radiator chassis. This became known as \\"the Bristol Dome\\" due to the popularity of orders from the National Bus Company for coaches on Bristol RELH and REMH chassis. The major competitor for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel design and built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had many of the design cues of the Panorama Elite and that could be because the managing director at that time was an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years. By the time the final version of the Panorama Elite III was built around 6,000 of the Elite series bodies had been produced. Development of a new coach range to supersede the Panorama Elite commenced in 1974 and was to be called Panorama Supreme, however the Panorama part was dropped in favour of simple Supreme.New Plaxton in production Commercial Motor 4 July 1975 This series of bodies was to have a long development process as both the factory and work force wasn't equipped for all-steel production at this stage. At first the Supreme was designed to replace the ageing Panorama IV that was produced on the Bedford VAS and SB chassis for up to 41 passengers. The design for that coach went back to the Embassy body developed in the early 1960s. It had been re-vamped in the early 1970s and given an upright front and rear like the Elite III. Being front engined it had a centre door and still retained the Panorama I‚Äìstyle square cornered flat glass windows. The Supreme was to herald (nearly) all steel construction. Wood fillets still held the panels in place and in some areas wood was sandwiched in \\"U\\" shaped steel. It would be 1978 before true all-steel construction was achieved. Some early Mark III Supremes were all-metal. The body number of the all-metal versions had the final letters AM standing for \\"all-metal\\". Many of the AM bodies were exported to the Netherlands and Denmark, a fact supported by the 1977 Supreme brochure and the 1982 centenary book Plaxtons The Great British Coachbuilders. There was to be six marques of Supreme (Seven including Mini Supreme). Development was protracted as the builder was careful not to compromise their market leading position. Supreme I was a 29-seat coach on a Bedford VAS chassis with a standard Plaxton in-swing door located behind the front axle. Supreme II was on the 35 seat Bristol LHS chassis powered by a Leyland 400 series engine. The door located forward of the front axle in the usual place. Supreme III was the first full size coach although there seemed to be some development confusion and the actual marque of the initial standard length coaches is not clear however most of the late P and earlier R-reg bodies seemed to be the Mark III. There were no identifying numbers added to the badging. As styling development commenced it was realised that to design another coach to match the success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by using the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with over-riders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite. The interior had been updated with a new dashboard and a driver's locker, non-reflective laminates and a re-designed front cabinet. The lift up roof vents and light clusters containing the speakers were almost like those of the final Panorama Elite III. Some very early Supremes had wood interior domes like Panorama Elite however this was changed from wood surrounding the clock to having ABS mouldings in black. The ceiling was of laminate that was bordered by chrome trim. The racks though went through several important stages before the final design that would see Supreme through to the series. Rack design on Panorama Elite, II and III contained window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate was used as trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection on each side of the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks used flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light. The Supreme Mark IV was introduced to the market at the International Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in 1978. The main update was that construction was now all steel, frontal design was completely different from the past 14 years. The headlights were now rectangular and mounted above each other with side lights and indicators in the same cluster. The grill was not so prominent and various options were available as a package. So now the range consisted of Supreme IV, Supreme IV Express and Supreme IV GT. The GT option ushered in a distinctive grill design with a smart dual chrome flash, tinted windows and better sound system and soft trim to the ceiling to name a few \\"standard\\" extras. Supreme V had a completely different rear design showing the styling of the next range that was probably under development. Tall heavily featured light clusters that were tinted to look dark were fitted vertically between the boot lid. The rear window was a one piece design. The seat backs were no longer visible from outside the coach. The rear nearside had been tidied by removing the smaller windows. The improvements were also copied onto the high floor Viewmaster model with the exception of the shallow rear window. The Supreme was also manufactured as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design was different from the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi- integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements. Final Supreme offering was the Supreme VI. This model was the least successful Supreme being an option for one season alongside the Supreme V. The panoramic windows had been replaced by a higher window line that was better suited to the long distance market. Around 100 were built. The actual idea of the high window design was possibly in reaction to the Duple Dominant III that had shallow trapezoidal windows like an Austin Princess headlight of the mid-1970s. The Supreme series like the Panorama I and Panorama Elite were simply a success from the outset winning many orders from small, national, and some international operators. It entered most fleets in large multiples. The export market was addressed with left hand drive versions, some modified for the Dutch market and at least one was built on Deutz chassis. The dynamic approach of Plaxtons relationship with their customers requirements was a huge factor in the success of the Supreme. =The Paramount era= Plaxton Paramount I bodied DAF MB200 in Chester in July 2007 Preserved Badgerline Plaxton Paramount I bodied Leyland Leopard in May 2011 Woods of Leicester Plaxton Paramount II bodied Volvo B10M in Chester By the end of the 1970s, the British coach scene was dominated by two similar vehicles - the Plaxton Supreme and the Duple Dominant. In the early 1980s coach services over 30 miles were deregulated by the Transport Act 1980 and there was an increasing attempt by some operators to compete with the railways and airlines for express and intercity travel. As a result, there was a move away from light- weight chassis by Bedford and Ford to heavier-duty chassis from Leyland and Volvo, and an emphasis on improved comfort and amenities. There was also a growing interest from operators in imports from Europe due to their stylish eye-catching designs that attracted passengers. In particular, designs from Neoplan and Van Hool received much attention. In response, Plaxton returned to Ogle Design to create a new look for their coach products. The result was the Plaxton Paramount, which appeared at the 1982 British Motor Show. The Paramount was a squarer design than the Supreme, with cleaner lines, a flatter roof line and a distinctive \\"feature window\\" just behind the front wheelarch. The use of the \\"feature window\\" was a return to a trump card played by the Ogle-inspired Panorama/Panorama I first seen in 1964. From there the waistline sloped down to meet the deeper windscreen. Initially there were two versions, the Paramount 3200 (available in 8, 10, 11 and 12-metre lengths) and the high- floor Paramount 3500 (available in 11 and 12 metre lengths) to replace the successful Viewmaster. Around 30% of Mark I Paramounts were the 3500 high- floor option, a greater proportion than had been anticipated. The rear of both versions were similar to Supreme V and VI but all else was new. In 1984 the design was adapted to produce the Paramount 4000 double-decker coach, initially built on Neoplan underframes. The design later appeared on chassis by Volvo, Scania and DAF. The Paramount II launched for the 1985 season brought a tidier frontal appearance. (See the picture with the Paramount 4000) Gone was the black plastic moulding below the windscreen and the \\"hole\\" like appearance of the centre of the grille between the lights. The rectangular headlights were retained within a bright silver like surround. Other modifications included deeper parcel racks that were capable of supporting air conditioning. A tweed like material was used to cover the interior skirt and a large part of the racks. A \\"low driver\\" option was available for the 3200. This was useful for touring however the driver lost the commanding view of the road ahead. The driver sat low in the body so the passengers have a better view ahead. The windscreen from the 3500 was used on this version of the 3200, the headlights being lower to the road than usual. 1986 saw the final and most elegant version of Paramount, the Mark III. According to brochures it was even stronger than the Paramount II. The sloping front window was gone and in its place a stepped front window that formed the first bay. In the glass Plaxton's \\"castle\\" logo was etched, the rear window contained a blind like decal at the base with a castle badge in the centre. The dashboard consisted of a moulded cabinet, ceasing the use of wood and formica of earlier versions of Plaxton coaches since the Panorama's. In the centre of the black finished cabinet was a large castle logo. Airline-style locker doors were now available on the parcel racks to further give a sleek appearance like a 747. In 1989 Plaxton responded to a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its contractors by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express' specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo etched into the fibre glass rear moulding. This period of coach design seemed to introduce the windowless rear as a design feature for most coaches. =Henlys and a new beginning= First Bristol Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Bath in October 2010 First London Plaxton President bodied Dennis Trident 2 at Upton Park station in July 2008 Southern Vectis Plaxton Premiere bodied Volvo B10M on the Isle of Wight in August 2011 JPT Bus Company Plaxton Centro bodied MAN 18.240 in Manchester in July 2008 The mid-1980s brought difficult times for Plaxton. A decline in orders due to the economic climate was compounded by management and production problems. The seasonal nature of coach production made recruiting difficult. In March 1987, Plaxton was taken over by Kirkby Bus & Coach, who were Plaxton's largest dealer. Kirkby soon invested in modernising the Scarborough factory and addressed some industrial relations problems. Kirkby also marketed the Hungarian Ikarus buses in the United Kingdom. In 1989, Plaxtons bought Henlys, a company that included 34 motor dealers and Coleman Milne, makers of hearses and limousines.Plaxton in Henlys Group mega deal Commercial Motor 8 June 1989 The name of the company was changed to Plaxton Group plc. In July 1989, Plaxton bought the manufacturing rights for the coach products of its main domestic competitor, Duple for ¬£4 million.Plaxton/Duple new creation Commercial Motor 28 September 1989 This included the jigs for the Duple 320 and the Duple 425 integral. Duple Services Ltd., the spares and repair business, was also purchased. The 320 was re-worked by Plaxtons at Scarborough later in 1989 and 25 were built and sold as the Plaxton 321. Many components from the Paramount were used both internally and externally. Identifying traits being the squared up wheel arches and Paramount side mouldings. The 321 was around ¬£6,000 cheaper than a comparable Paramount 3200 III and was only available from the Kirkby dealership. A Plaxton version of the higher floor Duple 340 was considered but none were built. A modified version of the Duple 425 integral design was introduced in 1991 and was briefly built in France by Carrosserie Lorraine as the Plaxton 425. Carrosserie Lorraine was a subsidiary of Iveco assembling Iveco 315 and 370 coaches for the French domestic market, but it was purchased by Plaxton in 1989 subject to a 3 year deal with Iveco to continue that arrangement. Sales of the Iveco-Lorraine had never been high (totalling only around 660 between 1981 and 1992) and Plaxton's efforts to expand the business by offering Lorraine coaches in the UK market were frustrated by the early 1990s recession. One batch of ten Iveco 315 Lorraine midicoaches was sold in the UK in 1990-92, and only twelve Plaxton 425 integrals were built at the French plant in 1991-92. The Carrosserie Lorraine factory closed in March 1992 when the three-year deal with Iveco expired.Plaxton shuts in France Commercial Motor 19 March 1992 The Dennis Dart, released in 1989, had been a runaway success, so in 1991 the Plaxton Pointer midibus was announced, this was quite a utilitarian, square body. This was followed by the Plaxton Verde, which Plaxton hoped would match the success of its smaller sister, but it failed to capture the market quite as much as the Pointer, and it was clear that the bus industry wasn't buying 12m single- deckers in as large numbers any more.Plaxton launches Verde Commercial Motor 21 March 1991 Later that year new coach bodies, the Plaxton Premiere and Plaxton Excalibur, were launched. In May 1992, after a management shake-up, the company was renamed Henlys Group. Henlys pursued a strategy of diversification and expansion through the 1990s. The established bus bodybuilder Northern Counties was bought in 1995 for ¬£10 million. The UK bus and coach manufacturing business, trading under the Plaxton brand, continued to produce a range of bus and coach bodywork. It also owned one of the largest UK coach dealers, Kirkby, and provided after-sales services to coach and bus operators. In August 2000, Henlys entered a joint venture with Mayflower Corporation, owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands.Mayflower and Henlys burst past rivalry to merge UK bus building The Independent 2 August 2000 The joint venture, known as TransBus International, included only the United Kingdom bus manufacturing operations of both companies, including Plaxton and Northern Counties. Henlys held a 30% stake in the joint venture, which employed 3,300 employees at seven locations. The traditional brands of Alexander, Dennis and Plaxton were replaced by TransBus International. =Independent again= On 31 March 2004, TransBus International was put into administration.Update: re Administration Mayflower Corporation 22 April 2004 On 17 May 2004, the Plaxton business was sold in a management buyout and resumed trading as Plaxton Limited.Companies House extract company no 5101150 Plaxton LimitedMBO heralds TransBus deal by end of this week The Scotsman 17 May 2004 Plaxton employed almost 300 people at its main coach plant in Scarborough and a further 59 at its facility in Anston, which builds small buses and coaches such as the Beaver and Cheetah. In May 2005, Plaxton announced its return to the service bus market, launching the Centro, a low- floor single-deck vehicle initially to be offered on VDL SB120 chassis, in 10.7 m length, with the first bus completed in February 2006. The Centro is now available on the VDL SB180, VDL SB200, MAN 14.220 and Volvo B7RLE chassis, with 10.2 m and 12 m lengths also offered. The company also revealed the Primo, a 28-seat low-floor minibus, in September 2005. This 7.9 m long vehicle is powered by the Cummins ISBe Euro III engine, mounted transversely at the rear. The Primo frame is assembled in Hungary by Enterprise Bus, effectively a conventional chassis in most respects but one which extends up to cantrail level, before being shipped to Scarborough for completion. =Purchase by Alexander Dennis= In May 2007, Plaxton was purchased by Alexander Dennis, effectively recreating the TransBus International business.Plaxton bought by ADL Bus & Coach Professional 14 May 2007Alexander Dennis buys Plaxton Herald Scotland 15 May 2007 But as of late 2008, the Centro bodywork remained in production alongside Alexander Dennis's Enviro200 Dart and Enviro300. In 2008, the new Plaxton Elite was launched at Birmingham Euro Bus Expo and by 2011 had delivered 100 Elites. Originally based on the Volvo B12B chassis, it was later developed to suit the Volvo B9R and B13R chassis.
