The FCI is primarily used to support asset management initiatives of federal, state, and local government facilities organizations. This would also include universities, housing and transportation authorities, and primary and secondary school systems. Mathematically the FCI is represented as Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement Deficiencies of the Facility(-ies) FCI = - Current Replacement Value of the Facility(-ies) The FCI as a tool was first published in 1991 by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). History Applied Management Engineering (AME) was approached by a research group working on a project that was sponsored by NACUBO. The group asked for a written description of the facility condition assessment process, and related data analysis. The resulting written process and analysis served as the basis for the book. Two of the AME employees that contributed were William H. (Bill) Thomas and the late Emmett Richardson. Both had previously worked for the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), which is the U.S. Navy's facilities engineering Systems Command. Thomas and Richardson had calculated the FCI for budget preparation and used the ratio to allocate operations and maintenance money across naval activities and installations. The FCI was a strictly informal tool that Thomas and Richardson used while working for the Navy. It was developed and adopted as an industry benchmark by AME. Application To calculate an FCI, a facility manager or third party assessment professional needs to quantify the cost of maintenance, repair and replacement deficiencies. This is typically the outcome of a Facility Condition Assessment. The current replacement value is defined as what monetary value the organization places on the facility. An accurate FCI is dependent on the cost estimates developed for the facility deficiencies and current replacement value. The FCI is a relative indicator of condition, and should be tracked over time to maximize its benefit. It is advantageous to define condition ratings based on ranges of the FCI. Managing the Facilities Portfolio provided a set of ratings: good (under 0.05), fair (0.05 to 0.10), and poor (over 0.10) based on evaluating data from various clients at the time of the publication. Today, many organizations are determining an appropriate FCI range for these ratings based upon their mission and strategic goals. The Higher Education Facilities Officers, APPA, use the FCI as part of their Strategic Assessment Model, and as a key Facilities Performance Indicator. Recommendation #6 in the National Research Council publication entitled \\"Stewardship of Federal Facilities states that performance indicators should be used to evaulate the effectiveness of facilities maintenance and repair programs. The American Public Works Association publication, Special Report #62, describes the use and value of facility condition rating systems in Chapter 3.6. Within the US Federal Government, the \\"condition index\\" (CI) is a general measure of the constructed asset's condition at a specific point in time.Federal Real Property Council Within the US Federal Government, CI is calculated using the same formula of the ratio of Repair Needs to Plant Replacement Value (PRV) but results are presented as a percentage where higher values mean better conditions. \\"Repair Needs\\" is the amount necessary to ensure that a constructed asset (i.e. building or structure) is restored to a condition substantially equivalent to the originally intended and designed capacity, efficiency, or capability. \\"Plant Replacement Value\\" (or \\"Functional Replacement Value\\") is the cost of replacing an existing building or structure at today's standards. The FCI can be used in the development and usage of Building Information Modeling for existing buildings. It is anticipated that future BIM will adhere to the format set forth by the Construction Specifications Institute.

The NDRF is a guide to promote effective recovery, particularly for those incidents that are large- scale or catastrophic. Similar to how the NRF is the overarching interagency response coordination structure for both Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) and non-Stafford Act incidents, the NDRF will provide the overarching inter-agency coordination structure for the recovery phase for Stafford Act incidents, and elements of the framework may also be used for significant non-Stafford Act incidents. The NDRF defines core recovery principles, roles and responsibilities of recovery coordinators and other stakeholders, a coordinating structure that facilitates communication and collaboration among all stakeholders, guidance for pre- and post-disaster recovery planning, and the overall process by which communities can capitalize on opportunities to rebuild stronger, smarter, and safer. History In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the United States Government passed federal legislation that mandated the creation of a national-level disaster recovery strategy. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) took the lead in developing the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF), releasing the first edition in September 2011 and the second edition in June 2016. The NDRF has been updated to include guidance for effective recovery by defining the roles, responsibilities, coordination, and planning among Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial jurisdictions. FEMA is one of the first government agencies in the world to develop a disaster recovery framework. The NDRF served as key reference document for the World Bank, UNDP, and EU in issuing the Guide to Developing Disaster Recovery Frameworks. The NDRF creates four new concepts: Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator (FDRC) As the level of response activities declines and recovery activities accelerate, the Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator (FDRC) will engage with the Recovery Support Function (RSF) agencies to organize and coordinate Federal recovery assistance. During this early recovery phase, the FDRC and the RSF coordinators are working closely with Emergency Support Function (ESF) leads to share information about impacts, assistance provided and working relationships at all levels. State or Tribal Disaster Recovery Coordinators (SDRC or TDRC) The role of the LDRMs, SDRCs and TDRCs is to organize, coordinate and advance the recovery at the local, State or Tribal level. The experience and skill sets of these individuals should include a strong basis in community development and good knowledge of the community's demographics. While these positions will often interact with the emergency management community, it is not necessary that these individuals be emergency management professionals. Their primary role is to manage and coordinate the redevelopment and building of community. In addition, the individuals occupying the positions should be able to represent and speak on behalf of their respective chief executives (e.g., mayor, governor, Tribal leader). The LDRMs and TDRCs serve as the jurisdiction's primary point of contact (POC) with the SDRC. Local Disaster Recovery Managers (LDRM) The NDRF strongly recommends that State governors as well as local government and Tribal leaders prepare as part of their disaster recovery plans to appoint Local Disaster Recovery Managers (LDRMs) and State/Tribal Disaster Recovery Coordinators (SDRCs/TDRCs) to lead disaster recovery activities for the jurisdiction. The role of the LDRMs, SDRCs and TDRCs is to organize, coordinate and advance the recovery at the local, State or Tribal level.

During the initial stage of sprinting, the runners have their upper body tilted forward in order to direct ground reaction forces more horizontally. As they reach their maximum velocity, the torso straightens out into an upright position. The goal of sprinting is to reach and maintain high top speeds to cover a set distance in the shortest possible time. A lot of research has been invested in quantifying the biological factors and mathematics that govern sprinting. In order to achieve these high velocities, it has been found that sprinters have to apply a large amount of force onto the ground to achieve the desired acceleration, rather than taking more rapid steps. Quantifying sprinting mechanics and governing equations Human legs during walking have been mechanically simplified in previous studies to a set of inverted pendulums, while distance running (characterized as a bouncing gait) has modeled the legs as springs. Until recently, it had been long believed that faster sprinting speeds are promoted solely by physiological features that increase stride length and frequency; while these factors do contribute to sprinting velocities, it has also been found that the runner's ability to produce ground forces is also very important. Weyand et al. (2000) Weyand, Peter G., Deborah B. Sternlight, Matthew J. Bellizzi, and Seth Wright. \\"Faster Top Running Speeds Are Achieved with Greater Ground Forces Not More Rapid Leg Movements.\\" Journal of Applied Physiology 89 (2000): 1991-999. came up with the following equation for determining sprint velocity: :V=f_\\\\text{step} F_\\\\text{avg}/W_\\\\text{b} L_\\\\text{c}, where V is the sprint velocity (m/s), f_\\\\text{step}the step frequency (1/s), F_\\\\text{avg} the average force applied to the ground (N), W_\\\\text{b} the body weight (N), and L_\\\\text{c} the contact length (m). In short, sprint velocity is reliant on three main factors: step frequency (how many steps you can take per second), average vertical force applied to the ground, and contact length (distance your center of mass translates over the course of one contact period). The formula was tested by having subjects run on a force treadmill (which is a treadmill that contains a force plate to measure ground reaction forces (GRF)). Figure 1 shows approximately what the force plate readout looks like for the duration of three steps. While this equation has proved to be fairly accurate, the study was limited in the sense that data was collected by a force plate that only measured vertical GRF rather than horizontal GRF. This led some people to the false pretense that simply exerting a greater vertical (perpendicular) force to the ground would lead to greater acceleration, which is far from correct (See Morin studies below). In 2005, Hunter et al.Hunter, JP. \\"Relationships between Ground Reaction Force Impulse and Kinematics of Sprint-running Acceleration.\\" Journal of Biomechanics 21 (2005): 31-43. conducted a study that determined relationships between sprint velocity and relative impulses in which gait and ground reaction force data was collected and analyzed. It was found that during accelerated runs, a typical support phase is characterized by a breaking phase followed by a propulsive phase (-FH followed by + FH). A common trend in the fastest subjects tested was that there was only a moderate to low amount of vertical force and a large amount of horizontal forces produced. Post study, it was hypothesized by the author that braking forces are necessary to store elastic energy in muscle and tendon tissue. This study loosely confirmed the importance of horizontal as well as vertical GRF during the acceleration phase of sprinting. Unfortunately, since data were collected at the 16-m mark, it was insufficient to draw definite conclusions regarding the entire acceleration phase. Morin et al. (2011) Morin, Jean-Beno√Æt, Pascal Edouard, and Pierre Samozino. \\"Technical Ability of Force Application as a Determinant Factor of Sprint Performance.\\" Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 43.9 (2011): 1680-688. performed a study to investigate the importance of ground reaction forces by having sprinters run on a force treadmill that measured both horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces. Belt velocity was measured for each step and calculations were performed to find the ‚Äúindex of force application technique‚Äù, which determines how well subjects are able to apply force in the horizontal direction. The second half of the test involved subjects performing a 100-m sprint on a man-made track using radar to measure the forward speed of runners to create velocity-time curves. The main result of this study showed that the force application technique (rather than simply the total amount of force applied) is the key determinant factor in predicting a sprinter's velocity. This has yet to be integrated into the governing equation of sprinting. Kinetics The kinetics of running describes the motion of a runner using the effects of forces acting on or out of the body. The majority of contributing factors to internal forces comes from leg muscle activation and arm swing. Leg Muscle Activation The muscles responsible for accelerating the runner forward are required to contract with increasing speed to accommodate the increasing velocity of the body. During the acceleration phase of sprinting, the contractile component of muscles is the main component responsible for the power output. Once a steady state velocity has been reached and the sprinter is upright, a sizable fraction of the power comes from the mechanical energy stored in the ‚Äòseries elastic elements‚Äô during stretching of the contractile muscles that is released immediately after the positive work phase.Cavagna, Giovanni A., L. Komarek, and Stefania Mazzoleni. \\"The Mechanics of Sprint Running.\\" The Journal of Physiology 217 (1971): 709-21. As the velocity of the runner increases, inertia and air resistance effects become the limiting factors on the sprinter's top speed. It was previously believed that there was an intramuscular viscous force that increased proportionally to the velocity of muscle contraction that opposed the contractile force; this theory has since been disproved.Furusawa, K., A. V. Hill, and J. L. Parkinson. \\"The Dynamics of \\"Sprint\\" Running.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 102.713 (1927): 29-42. In a study conducted in year 2004, the gait patterns of distance runners, sprinters, and non-runners was measured using video recording. Each group ran a 60-meter run at 5.81 m/s (to represent distance running) and at maximal running speed. The study showed that non-sprinters ran with an inefficient gait for the maximal speed trial while all groups ran with energetically efficient gaits for the distance trial. This indicates that the development of an economical distance running form is a natural process while sprinting is a learned technique that requires practice.Bushnell, Tyler Dwight. A Biomechanical Analysis of Sprinters vs. Distance Runners at Equal and Maximal Speeds. Thesis. Brigham Young University. Dept. of Exercise Sciences, 2004. Arm Swing Contrary to the findings of Mann et al. (1981),Mann, Ralph V. \\"A Kinetic Analysis of Sprinting.\\" Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 13.5 (1981): 325-28. arm swing plays a vital role in both stabilizing the torso and vertical propulsion. Regarding torso stabilization, arm swing serves to counterbalance the rotational momentum created by leg swing, as suggested by Hinrichs et al. (1987).Hinrichs, R. N. \\"Upper Extremity Function in Running. II: Angular Momentum Considerations.\\" International Journal of Sport Biomechanics 3 (1987): 242-63. In short, the athlete would have a hard time controlling the rotation of their trunk without arm swing. The same study also suggested that, as opposed to popular belief, the horizontal force production capabilities of the arms are limited due to the backward swing that follows the forward swing, so the two components cancel each other out. This is not to suggest, however, that arm swing does not contribute to propulsion at all during sprinting; in fact, it can contribute up to 10% of the total vertical propulsive forces that a sprinter can apply to the ground. The reason for this is that, unlike the forward-backward motion, both arms are synchronized in their upward-downward movement. As a result, there is no cancellation of forces. Efficient sprinters have an arm swing that originates from the shoulder and has a flexion and extension action that is of the same magnitude of the flexion and extension occurring at the ipsilateral shoulder and hip. Energetics Di Prampero et al.Di Prampero, PE, S. Fusi, JB Morin, A. Belli, and G. Antonutto. \\"Sprint Running: a New Energetic Approach.\\" Journal of Experimental Biology 208.14 (2005): 2809-816. mathematically quantifies the cost of the acceleration phase (first 30 m) sprint running through experimental testing. The subjects sprinted repeatedly on a track while radar determined their velocity. Additionally, it has been found in previous literature Di Prampero, P. E., S. Fusi, and G. Antonutto. \\"Of Sprint Running or Running Uphill?\\" The Journal of Physiology 543 (2002): 198. that the energetics of sprinting on flat terrain is analogous to uphill running at a constant speed. The mathematical derivation process is loosely followed below: In the initial phase of sprint running, the total acceleration acting on the body (g') is the vectoral sum of the forward acceleration and earth's acceleration due to gravity: : g'=((a_\\\\text{f}^2+g^2))^{0.5} The ‚ÄúEquivalent slope‚Äù (ES) when sprinting on flat ground is: :\\\\text{ES} = \\\\tan\\\\left(90-\\\\arctan\\\\left(g+a_\\\\text{f}\\\\right)\\\\right) The ‚ÄúEquivalent normalized body mass‚Äù (EM) is then found to be: :\\\\text{EM}=\\\\frac{g'}{g}=\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{a_\\\\text{f}^2}{g^2} +1\\\\right)\\\\right]^{0.5} Following the data collection, the cost of sprinting (C_\\\\text{sr}) was found to be: :C_\\\\text{sr}=((155.4\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^5-(30.4\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^4-(43.3\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^3+(46.3\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^2+19.5\\\\,\\\\text{ES} + 3.6)\\\\,\\\\text{EM} The above equation does not take wind resistance into account, so considering the cost of running against wind resistance (C_\\\\text{aer}), which is known to be: :C_\\\\text{aer}=k' v^2 We combine the two equations to arrive at: :C_\\\\text{sr}=((155.4\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^5-(30.4\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^4-(43.3\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^3+(46.3\\\\,\\\\text{ES})^2+19.5\\\\,\\\\text{ES} + 3.6)\\\\,\\\\text{EM} +k' v^2 Where g' is the acceleration of the runner's body, a_\\\\text{f} the forward acceleration, g the acceleration of gravity, k' a proportionality constant and v the velocity. Fatigue effects Fatigue is a prominent factor in sprinting, and it is already widely known that it hinders maximal power output in muscles, but it also affects the acceleration of runners in the ways listed below.  Submaximal muscle coordination  A study on muscle coordination Billaut, F., F. Basset, and G. Falgairette. \\"Muscle Coordination Changes during Intermittent Cycling Sprints.\\" Neuroscience Letters 380.3 (2005): 265-69. in which subjects performed repeated 6-second cycling sprints, or intermittent sprints of short duration (ISSD) showed a correlation between decrease in maximal power output and changes in motor coordination. In this case, motor coordination refers to the ability to coordinate muscle movements in order to optimize a physical action, so submaximal coordination indicates that the muscles are no longer activating in sync with one another. The results of the study showed that a delay between the vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Since there was a decrease in power during ISSD occurring in tandem with changes in VL-BF coordination, it is indicated that changes in inter-muscle coordination is one of the contributing factors for the reduced power output resulting from fatigue. This was done using bicycle sprinting, but the principles carry over to sprinting from a runner's perspective.  Hindrance of effective force application techniques  Morin et al.Morin, Jean-Benoit, Pierre Samozino, Pascal Edouard, and Katja Tomazin. \\"Effect of Fatigue on Force Production and Force Application Technique during Repeated Sprints.\\" Journal of Biomechanics 44.15 (2011): 2719-723. explored the effects of fatigue on force production and force application techniques in a study where sprinters performed four sets of five 6 second sprints using the same treadmill setup as previously mentioned. Data was collected on their ability to produce ground reaction forces as well as their ability to coordinate the ratio of ground forces (horizontal to vertical) to allow for greater horizontal acceleration. The immediate results showed a significant decrease in performance with each sprint and a sharper decrease in rate of performance depreciation with each subsequent data set. In conclusion, it was obvious that both the total force production capability and technical ability to apply ground forces were greatly affected. Injury Prevention Running gait (biomechanics) is very important for not only efficiency but also for injury prevention. Approximately between 25 and 65% of all runners experience running related injuries each year.Peter Cavanagh, PhD. Biomechanics of Distance Running. Chapter 2, Human Kinetics, 1990 Abnormal running mechanics are often cited as the cause of injuries. However, few suggest altering a person's running pattern in order to reduce the risk of injury. Wearable technology companies like I Measure U are creating solutions using biomechanics data to analyse the gait of a runner in real time and provide feedback on how to change the running technique to reduce injury risk.Wearable tech - Mark Finch, I Measure U NZ Herald References Category:Biomechanics Category:Sprint (running) ","title":"Biomechanics of sprint running"},{"id":"33989928","text":"George Gardiner (1608/1615 - c. 1677), sometimes spelled Gardner, was an early inhabitant of Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and one of the original settlers of Aquidneck Island. He held some minor offices within the colony in the early 1640s, shortly after which he began a common-law marriage with Herodias (Long) Hicks, who came to live with him after separating from her first husband. This relationship lasted for nearly 20 years, after which Herodias petitioned the court to have Gardiner leave her alone, and she left Newport to go west of the Narragansett Bay and live with John Porter, a land-rich settler who was one of the original purchasers of the Pettaquamscutt lands (later South Kingstown, Rhode Island). Gardiner apparently had seven children with Herodias, and after her departure, five more with subsequent wife Lydia Ballou. His family produced a large number of descendants. A grandson, John Gardner served as Deputy Governor of the Rhode Island colony.  Life  George Gardiner was one of the earliest settlers of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and first appears in the public record in 1638, when he was admitted as an inhabitant of Portsmouth, on Aquidneck Island. A genealogy published in 1937 identified him with the George Gardner, baptized in 1599/1600 at Great Greenford, Middlesex, England, son of Michael and Margaret (Browne) Gardiner. They further identify George with the groom in a 1630 marriage at St. James, Clerkenwell, London to Sara Slaughter. However, prominent genealogist G. Andrews Moriarty demonstrated that evidence for this identification was lacking, and that the identification was unlikely. Moriarty's strongest evidence against this arrangement is that Gardiner would have sired five children while between the age of 67 and 74, which, though possible, is highly improbable, and that \\"no critical genealogist can accept the identification\\" unless supporting evidence were to be found. He gives a birth date in the range of 1608 to 1615 as being far more likely for the New England George Gardiner, and concludes that there is no evidence for an earlier marriage of this man, nor to assign his oldest children to a spouse other than Herodias (Long) Hicks. Gardiner followed William Coddington to Newport in 1639, but his name was not on the list of the nine men who signed an agreement to establish the new government there. He was a Newport freeman in December 1639 and a land owner there the following year when he had 58 acres recorded. He was named as Constable and Senior Sergeant in 1642, and was an Ensign two years later. At about this time he commenced a relationship with Herodias (Long) Hicks, a woman who has been generally referred to as his common-law wife. John Hicks, the previous husband of Herodias, was in the process of obtaining a divorce from her in Rhode Island in December 1643, when he sent a letter from Flushing, New Netherland to Rhode Island magistrate John Coggeshall. Hicks also eventually obtained a divorce from her in New Netherland, charging her with adultery. During the next two decades Gardiner and Herodias had many children, and in the mid-1650s Herodias became a Quaker convert. In May 1658, Herodias, \\"with her babe at her breast\\" (her daughter Rebecca) traveled from Newport to her former residence in Weymouth in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to deliver her religious testimony, accompanied by her friend Mary Stanton. The women had made a very difficult journey through a wilderness of more than 60 miles, made all the more perilous by the fact that Massachusetts had banished any known Quakers living within the colony, and had forbidden others from entering as missionaries. Upon her arrival in the Bay Colony, Herodias was taken before Governor John Endicott, who sentenced the two women to be whipped with ten lashes from a threefold knotted whip of cords. Following the whipping, Herodias spent 14 days in jail. In August 1662, Gardiner and Robert Stanton, also of Newport, purchased a large tract of land in the \\"Narragansett country,\\" just west of the Pettaquamscutt Purchase. A few years later, after living together for nearly 20 years, a rift developed between Gardiner and Herodias, and in May 1665 he appeared before the General Assembly upon the petition of Herodias, who \\"now desired...that the estate and labor he had of mine, he may allow it me, and house upon my land I may enjoy without molestation and that he may allow me my child to bring up, with maintenance for her, and that he be restrained from troubling me more.\\" By this time she had already left Gardiner, and was living in Pettaquamscutt (later South Kingstown) with John Porter. Gardiner soon thereafter married Lydia Ballou, who was his wife in June 1668 when he was made one of the overseers of the will of his father-in-law, Robert Ballou. While Gardiner apparently remained in Newport, his children by Herodias went with their mother. He died about 1677, but was certainly dead by 14 June 1678 when his widow married William Hawkins. According to a Providence record, Gardiner left a will in Newport, but it was lost as were most Newport records following the British occupation of the city during the American Revolutionary War.  Family and descendants Gardiner had seven children by Herodias, and an additional five children with his subsequent wife Lydia. Following Gardiner's separation from Herodias, his children by her went with her to the Narragansett country and received many parcels of land from her last husband John Porter, who had substantial land holdings. Their descendants were numerous in North Kingstown and South Kingstown. George's children by his second wife, Lydia Ballou, remained in Newport. His grandson John Gardner, the son of Joseph, served as Deputy Governor of the colony for eight years between 1754 and 1764.

Takeda will withdraw the Omontys U.S. New Drug Application (NDA) Two randomized controlled trials published in 2013 found that the effectiveness of peginesatide was not inferior to epoetin for patients receiving dialysis (the EMERALD study), or to darbepoetin for patients with chronic kidney disease who were not receiving dialysis (the PEARL study). However, the safety endpoint of cardiovascular events and death was worse for peginesatide than for darbepoetin in the PEARL study. Medical uses The FDA approved the use of peginesatide for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease in adult patients on dialysis. Chemistry and mechanism of action Peginesatide is a synthetic peptide, attached to polyethylene glycol (\\"PEGylated\\"). It mimics the structure of erythropoietin, the human glycoprotein which promotes red blood cell development. Related drugs The erythropoietin analogs currently used to treat anemia in the United States are epoetin alfa (sold under the names Procrit and Epogen) and darbepoetin alfa (which is a more glycosylated form of epoetin, sold under the name Aranesp). There are similar biologic agents, such as Mircera (a monoPEGylated erythropoietin-beta), sold by Roche in Europe, Chugai in Japan, and VFMCRP in the United States.

Lucy is an American linguist and psychologist who has been studying the relations between language and cognition, and especially the hypothesis of linguistic relativity, since 1979. He is the William Benton Professor in the Department of Comparative Human Development and the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago. He has worked extensively with the Yucatec Maya language, specializing in the system of noun classification. Research John Lucy is a modern proponent of the linguistic relativity hypothesis. He has argued for a weak version of this hypothesis as a result of his comparative studies between the grammars of English and Mayan Yucatec.Velasco Maillo, Honorio. 'Linguistic Relativity.' In Hablar y Pensar, Tareas Culturales. Temas de Antropolog√≠a Ling√º√≠stica y Cognitiva, Madrid, 2003, pp 259‚Äì353 One of the experiments that he has carried out goes as follows: He showed a series of objects to native speakers of each language, showing them a single object in first place and two different objects afterwards. Participants then had to choose which of the latter two they found was the most similar to the first one. Lucy noticed that native speakers of English would usually choose an object according to its shape, whereas Yucatec speakers would take into account what matter the object was made of. Thus, if for example, they were shown a cardboard box, English speakers would usually choose a box-like object as the most similar one, whereas Yucatec speakers would prefer to choose any object made of cardboard, regardless of its shape. Lucy attributed these results to the presence of nominal classifiers in Mayan Yucatec: every time the noun is preceded by a numeral, these nominal classifiers are placed between the numeral and the noun, and their function is to specify what the shape of the noun is like. Therefore, the noun, when not accompanied by a classifier, is seen by Yucatec speakers as a shapeless entity, as opposed to English speakers, who understand the object as something already shaped.Lucy, John.

Club career Early career Born in Gallipoli, in the Province of Lecce, Apulia, Gabrieli started his career at local side U.S. Lecce. Gabrieli joined Poggibonsi on loan in July 2008 in order to gain first team experience. That season the club also signed young keepers Gaetano Lattanzi and Valerio Mollo. Gabrieli fought off competition from his teammates to win a starting place in the team, and played all 34 league matches of the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In July 2009 he joined Cosenza on loan along with Giuseppe Caccavallo. He was the understudy of Andrea Pinzan until Pinzan was exchanged with Giancarlo Petrocco. At first Gabrieli was a backup to Petrocco, but he replaced Petrocco in round 24 (21 February), and was promoted to the club's first choice keeper. Gabrieli also replaced Petrocco in round 21 (24 January). Gabrieli left for Paganese in August 2010, rejoining Lecce team-mates Gianmarco Ingrosso and Vittorio Triarico. He was the club's first choice keeper until the arrival of Paolo Ginestra in December. In January 2011 he was signed by Barletta, as the team's first choice keeper ahead of Giuseppe Di Masi and the injured Andrea Tesoniero. Return to Lecce On 1 July 2011, Gabrieli returned to Lecce, wearing the number one jersey. However, he was the understudy to J√∫lio S√©rgio and Massimiliano Benassi after Antonio Rosati was sold. He made his first start on 21 December 2011, in a 4‚Äì1 home loss to Internazionale. Before the match, coach Serse Cosmi had lost both first choice keepers and also called up Luigi Turbacci from the Primavera youth team, who was used as a backup on the bench. He remained with Lecce for the 2012‚Äì13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season after the club's relegation from Serie A in 2011‚Äì12 and subsequent expulsion from the Serie B for their part in the Calcio Scommesse scandal. Casale On 31 January 2013 he left for Casale. Prato On 26 March 2014, he was signed by Prato. Gallipoli Martina On 25 July 2015 Gabrieli was signed by Martina. International career Italy U-19 side Gabrieli was a backup goalkeeper for the Italy U-19 side in 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship elite qualification, behind Edoardo Pazzagli. Gabrieli also played once, the third and last match of that stage. Coach Francesco Rocca picked two keepers born in 1989, instead of picking from the pool of players born in 1988, the age limit of that season. Gabrieli was the starting keeper in 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification, ahead of Vincenzo Fiorillo. However, Gabrieli was not selected by Rocca to the elite round, who picked Fiorillo and Carlo Pinsoglio instead. Italy U-20 side Since Rocca was appointed as the coach of the Italy U-20 team in 2008, he selected Gabrieli to the team at the start of 2008‚Äì09 season. However, Gabrieli failed to make a debut. Instead Gabrieli received call-up from Italy national under-20 football C team but once again failed to make his debut with the side. He was only able to play for U-20 C team (or known as \\"U-20 Lega Pro\\") in the 2009 Lega Pro Quadrangular Tournament, a tournament competed by the three U-21 representative teams from the three groups of Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, as well as the \\"U-20 Lega Pro\\" team.

Paul Grottkau (1846‚Äì1898) was a German-American socialist political activist and newspaper publisher. Grottkau is best remembered as an editor alongside Haymarket affair victim August Spies of the Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung, one of the leading American radical newspapers of the decade of the 1880s. Later moving to Milwaukee, Grottkau became one of the leading luminaries of the socialist movement in Wisconsin. Biography Early years Paul Grottkau was born and raised in 1846 in Berlin, Prussia (now part of Germany), the son of a relatively prosperous noble family.Harmut Keil, \\"The German Immigrant Working Class of Chicago, 1875-90: Workers, Labor Leaders, and the Labor Movement,\\" in Dirk Hoerder (ed.), American Labor and Immigration History, 1877-1920s: Recent European Research. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983; pg. 165. Grottkau was trained as an architect.\\"Paul Grottkau, 1846-1898,\\" Dictionary of Wisconsin History, Wisconsin Historical Society, www.wisconsinhistory.org/ Part of this training process involved Grottkau's learning the crafts of stonemasonry and building, activities which brought him into contract with members of the working class and first introduced him to socialist ideas. Grottkau was initially highly influenced by the electorally-oriented ideas of Ferdinand Lassalle. By 1871 Grottkau was already a member of the General German Workingmen's Association and worked as an organizer for the burgeoning social democratic movement. He also served as editor of the official organ of the Bricklayers Union, Grundstein, and as editor of the radical Berliner Freie Presse.Harmut Keil, \\"A Profile of Editors of the German-American Radical Press, 1850-1910,\\" in Elliott Shore, Ken Fones-Wolf, and James P. Danky (eds.), The German-American Radical Press: The Shaping of a Left Political Culture, 1850-1940. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992; pp. 20-21. This political activism placed Grottkau in the sights of the German police. Faced with arrest by the authorities under the Anti-Socialist Laws, Grottkau emigrated to the United States of America in 1878. A talented writer and orator, Grottkau found his way to the German √©migr√© community in Chicago, where he immediately landed a job on the staff of the Social Democratic Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung (Chicago Workers' News). Chicago years August Spies, Grottkau's editorial colleague on the staff of the Chicagoer Arbeiter- Zeitung and one of the \\"Haymarket Martyrs\\" of 1886. It was not long before Grottkau was made editor of the daily Arbeiter-Zeitung, working closely alongside managing editor August Spies, a man later killed in a retaliatory execution in the aftermath of the May 1886 Haymarket bombing. Together with Spies and the American-born Albert Parsons, Grottkau emerged as one of the leaders of the radical movement in Chicago during the tumultuous end of the 1870s and first years of the 1880s.Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1903; pg. 235. During this interval the socialist movement of Chicago, centered around branches of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), began to turn towards the ideas of armed insurrection and anarchism. Membership in the SLP plummeted, hitting a low water mark of just 1500 members in 1883, while the number of semi- independent anarchist \\"groups\\" multiplied and their membership rolls proliferated.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 238. Grottkau, like many others, was briefly swept up in this tide, and the Arbeiter-Zeitung was made a leading voice of American anarchism. In the view of historian Howard H. Quint the reason for Grottkau's willingness to cast his lot with the so-called Social Revolutionaries (i.e. the Anarchists) in the early 1880s was related not to his affinity for their paramilitary auxiliary, units of the Lehr und Wehr Verein (Educational and Defensive Society), but rather due to a desire to change the personnel and tepid policy of the SLP, exemplified by the group's National Secretary, Philip Van Patten.Howard H. Quint, The Forging of American Socialism: Origins of the Modern Movement: The Impact of Socialism on American Thought and Action, 1886-1901. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1953; pg. 19. While the meddling of Van Patten and the Detroit-based National Executive Committee of the SLP may have been Grottkau's primary objection, he nevertheless went all the way with the anarchist wing for a time, going so far as to himself briefly join the Lehr und Wehr Verein.Frederic Heath, Socialism in America, (a.k.a. Social Democracy Red Book.) Terre Haute: Debs Publishing Co., 1900; pg. 35. Grottkau ultimately broke with Spies, Parsons, and the Social Revolutionaries following the 1883 Pittsburgh Convention of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, which formally rejected socialist collectivism in favor of communist anarchism.Gary M. Fink (ed.), \\"Paul Grottkau,\\" in Biographical Dictionary of the American Left. Revised Edition. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 268-269. In the aftermath the Socialist Revolutionaries went over to full-fledged anarchism, while the more moderate and electorally oriented elements such as Grottkau returned to the ranks of the SLP.Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pp. 21-22. This new fissure was made eminently clear on the evening of May 24, 1884, when Grottkau appeared before a Chicago audience to debate the \\"Communist\\" position against Johann Most, a leading voice of the Anarchist movement.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 241. Morris Hillquit, one of the earliest historians of American socialism, recalled the affair: > It was a well-matched contest, the opponents being equally well-versed in > the subject of discussion and both being fluent speakers and ready debaters. > The discussion was very thoroughgoing and dealt with almost every phase of > the subject. It was reported stenographically, published in book form, and > widely circulated.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pp. > 241-242. Another pioneer historian of American socialism, Frederic Heath, recalls the Most-Grottkau debate as pivotal in Grottkau's own personal story. According to his account: > Grottkau was now thoroughly enlisted against the Anarchists, realizing that > they were inimical to the true interests of the proletarian movement. He > fought valiantly for his view of the matter and wrote and spoke ardently, > but the ground he had himself prepared was against him. He had a notable > debate with Most in which he had decidedly the best of the argument and > achieved an intellectual and argumentative victory; but not so thought the > crowd, which was still filled with his previous teachings. A few weeks later > he was forced to retire from the Arbeiter-Zeitung and to turn over the > editorial pen to August Spies, the former business manager, a man more to > Most's liking.Heath, Social Democracy Red Book, pg. 37. Milwaukee years Forced out of his editorial position in Chicago, Grottkau left the city to establish a paper of his own in Milwaukee, Wisconsin ‚Äî the Milwaukee'r Arbeiter-Zeitung (Milwaukee Workers' News), issued three times a week.Marvin Wachman, History of the Social-Democratic Party of Milwaukee, 1897-1910. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1945; pg. 10. The paper commenced publication in 1886.Shore, Fones-Wolf, and Danky (eds.), The German-American Radical Press, pg. 215. Gov. Jeremiah Rusk, who called out the National Guard on Milwaukee strikers early in May 1886. Grottkau would be imprisoned in the aftermath. Grottkau became one of the leaders of the militant Milwaukee Central Labor Union, a group which, together with the Knights of Labor, coordinated a march in that city on May Day 1886 as a means of agitating for establishment of the 8-hour day. About 16,000 people participated in the May Day festivities, with several thousand marching in support of the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor.Henry E. Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History: The Story of the State. Milwaukee: Sentinel Co., 1898; pg. 303. This gathering and march proceeded without incident, but the groundwork seems to have been laid for further activity. On Monday, May 3, 1886, a general strike was called on Milwaukee's breweries, with as many as 1,000 men marching on Falk's Brewery in an effort to close the facility. Masses of brewery workers joined the protest and by that evening some 14,000 brewery workers were out on strike. That same afternoon several hundred Polish workers went to the railroad shops located in the Menomonee Valley to appeal to the 1400 railway shopmen working there to join the general strike.Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History, pg. 304. Most refused to quit work and law enforcement authorities were called upon to break up the group of strike agitators. The Polish strike leaders proceeded to the Reliance Iron Works, where fire hoses were turned on them, with the effect that \\"the catapult power of the stream shot some of the men clear across the street.\\" About 20 policemen appeared on the scene and began clubbing the wet strikers with their hickory nightsticks.Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History, pg. 305. Governor Jeremiah Rusk was notified by telegraph and several units of the National Guard were dispatched to Milwaukee from their station in Madison, arriving on the scene the next morning. At about 7 am, some 600 or 700 men, armed with clubs, assembled and began to march on the steel rolling mills located in the Bay View area of the city. The protest degenerated into violence, with the so-called \\"reign of terror\\" recalled by one contemporary adherent of law and order: > Idle workmen paraded the streets; men willing to work were urged to join the > demonstration and in many cases compelled to do so; crowds armed with paving > blocks, billets, and other improvised weapons of the street overturned > hucksters' stands, invaded manufacturing establishments, and even attacked > them. As the riotous proceedings grew to large proportions and the city > seemed about to be stretched at the mercy of a mob, a deadly fire from the > rifles of state militiamen was poured into a crowd of Polish workmen and > ended the lawlessness which had threatened to grow beyond control.Legler, > Leading Events of Wisconsin History,pg. 301. The same historian noted that despite the firing of shots, \\"not one person was wounded in the volley,\\" noting: > Many of the mob, as they saw the rifles aimed, threw themselves flat upon > the ground, others sought shelter behind woodpiles and telegraph posts and > fences. Notwithstanding, it seemed providential that the ground was not > strewn with dead and dying. Many buildings in range of the rifles were > perforated with bullets ...Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History, pp. > 306-307. Rolling Mills of the Milwaukee Iron Company at Bay View, objective of strikers involved in the May 1886 Bay View Massacre, a disturbance for which Grottkau was imprisoned. In the afternoon of Wednesday, May 5, 1886, strikers again assembled to march on the company town of Bay View.Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History, pg. 307. This time, new orders had been issued to the members of the National Guard by Governor Rusk ‚Äî that, in the event of the repeat of mob tactics, the guardsmen should this time shoot to kill. Guardsmen blocked the road. When the approaching strikers were 1000 yards away, commanding officer Major George P. Traeumer gave the command to fire and a hail of bullets was unleashed on the crowd.Legler, Leading Events of Wisconsin History, pg. 308. The number wounded will never be known, having been carried away by the fleeing crowd, but eight people died in what is today remembered as the Bay View Massacre. Included among these was an old man who had been feeding chickens in his yard and a young schoolboy. In the aftermath Paul Grottkau was arrested, ostensibly as the perpetrator of the strike, and sentenced to one year in prison. Grottkau served only six weeks of this sentence before being released, during which time he ran a campaign in an effort to become the next Mayor of Milwaukee. Grottkau would continue to edit the Milwaukee'r Arbeiter-Zeitung until 1888, briefly moving back to Chicago following the publication's sale to again work on the paper's Chicago namesake. Later years Grottkau moved to San Francisco, California in 1889. There he became editor of the California Arbeiterzeitung, a short-lived publication. In 1890 Grottkau was named as a traveling organizer by the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor, assigned the task of touring the country on behalf of the Federation's campaign for the 8-hour day. In January 1893 Grottkau's old newspaper, the Arbeiter-Zeitung, was sold to a young Jewish schoolteacher of Austrian birth, Victor L. Berger, who relaunched the publication as the Wisconsin Vorw√§rts ('Wisconsin Forward').Sally M. Miller, Victor Berger and the Promise of Constructive Socialism, 1910-1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1973; pg. 32. This would be the first of several publication's in Berger's portfolio, which would ultimately prove to be the stepping-stone to the socialist publisher's election to United States Congress in the fall of 1910. During his final year of life Grottkau joined the Social Democracy of America, a political forerunner of the Socialist Party of America.\\"Labor Leader's Death: Paul Grottkau Expires at St. Joseph's Hospital,\\" Milwaukee News, June 4, 1898, unspecified page.

Death and legacy In the spring of 1898, Grottkau made a speaking tour on behalf of the Social Democracy, visiting the cities of Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit. During this trip Grottkau contracted pneumonia, which led to his hospitalization at St. Joseph's Hospital in Milwaukee on May 30. Grottkau's condition continued to deteriorate and he succumbed to the effects of the illness in the evening of June 3, 1898. A funeral was held in Milwaukee on June 5, 1898, which was addressed by Victor L. Berger in German as well as by other prominent Milwaukee labor and political leaders.

Designed by HUSS Park Attractions, the ride first opened on April 12, 2003, as the largest Frisbee ride of its kind in the world. The record-setting ride is able to swing 50 passengers up to reaching a height of above ground. History Throughout the 1990s, roller coaster popularity soared as the number of roller coasters in the United States increased from roughly 165 to over 200 by the end of the decade. As the U.S. economy slowed in 2001, however, many parks began to turn to more cost-effective thrill rides. HUSS Park Attractions (previously known as Huss Maschinenfabrik) spent most of its existence since the late 1970s creating small and mid-size flat rides for traveling carnivals and small amusement parks. As the company evolved taking on more challenging projects, they quickly discovered a growing market for unique flat ride designs that were affordable and could be easily marketed. The rides grew in size and accommodated larger capacities over time attracting major amusement parks around the world. Paramount's Kings Island decided to test the waters in 2002 with a Giant Top Spin ride manufactured by HUSS that would open as the largest in the world and the first to be completely enclosed. Originally known as Tomb Raider: The Ride, PKI viewed the attraction as a complete success and worked with HUSS to open another flat ride the following year in Kings Island's Action Zone. This time, HUSS went with a concept that would create a significant visual impact on the spectator. Their Frisbee design was first introduced in 1994 and quickly evolved into a model that could swing 40 passengers up to 90 degrees at off the ground. For its debut at Kings Island, HUSS created its first Giant Frisbee version that increased the capacity to 50 passengers, extended the pendulum arm to , and increased the angle to 120 degrees. Riders could now be lifted to a height of off the ground reaching speeds up to and experiencing a positive g-force of up to 4.5 g. Ride experience The beginning of the line queue is positioned close to one side of the attraction, so that when the ride is in motion, the circular gondola appears to just miss the overhead canvas that protects from falling objects. As a result, a strong breeze is felt by guests waiting in line. Riders are later arranged into two groups of 25 before entering the final section of the line queue. The restraints that secure riders are over the shoulder. The ride begins with a hissing sound of air, and the metal platform separates into eight pie-shaped wedges as it retracts away from the gondola. Into the first swing, the gondola immediately begins rotating slowly as each consecutive swing intensifies. The rotation allows riders' experience to change throughout the entire ride, and at each swing's peak, a brief floating sensation can be felt. Within thirty seconds, the pendulum reaches its maximum arc of 240 degrees. As the ride cycle nears the end, the pendulum slows to a stop nearly as fast as it accelerated in the beginning. Within a few swings, the gondola moves into a controlled stop as the loading platform lifts back into place.

He was the author of many novels, short stories, dramas, screenplays, essays and radio dramas, translated into at least nine languages, including Russian, Chinese and Esperanto.  Life and career  Jo≈æa Horvat (right) and Franjo Tuƒëman in February 1945 Horvat was born in Kotoriba, Meƒëimurje, northern Croatia, at the time in Zala County in Hungary. During World War II he fought in Yugoslav Partisans, which later inspired the novel Maƒçak pod ≈°ljemom (Tomcat under a Helmet, 1962) which had a somewhat ironical view of the partisan movement, adapted both into a feature film and a miniseries. The screenplay Ciguli Miguli (1952), critical of bureaucracy, briefly brought him into disfavour with the Communist party authorities, on which occasion he turned to sailing. In mid-1960s Horvat and his family sailed the world in the sailing yacht Besa, and his travel journal Besa‚Äìbrodski dnevnik (Besa‚ÄìShip's Log, 1973) became a best-seller. The second trip around the world was marked by tragedy: Horvat‚Äôs older son, who stayed back, died in a traffic accident in 1973, and his younger son drowned in Venezuela in 1975. After a period of deep crisis Horvat published two acclaimed novels inspired by these events, Operacija \\"Stonoga\\" (Operation \\"Centipede\\", 1982), about a search for a lost island in the Atlantic, and Waitapu (1984), about a Pacific Islander boy who decides to sail across a taboo line. His last work is a memoir titled Svjedok prolaznosti (A Witness to Impermanence, 2005). Horvat attended the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb and served as a secretary of Matica hrvatska.

Fuente attended the University of Oklahoma before transferring to Murray State University after his redshirt sophomore season. He played quarterback for both schools. Fuente played a single season with the Oklahoma Wranglers of the Arena Football League. Fuente has coached quarterbacks as an assistant or head coach including three time Pro Bowler Andy Dalton, first round draft pick Paxton Lynch, and arena football quarterback Jerod Evans. Early life Fuente was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Justin married his wife Jenny in 2005 and they have 3 daughters. Playing career High school Fuente attended Union High School in Tulsa, where he threw for 6,104 yards and 65 touchdowns. In 1994, his senior season he led the state in both passing yards (2,934) and touchdown passes (32). Statewide recognition followed, with the Tulsa World naming him \\"Player of the Year\\" and The Oklahoman \\"All-State Offensive Player of the Year.\\". Several schools recruited Fuente, including Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Tulsa and Texas A&M;, but he ultimately signed with Oklahoma under coach Howard Schnellenberger in February 1995. College Fuente redshirted at Oklahoma for the 1995 season behind Eric Moore at quarterback. Following the season, Schnellenberger resigned as head coach and John Blake replaced him. Entering the 1996 season, Fuente backed up Moore. However, after Oklahoma opened the season with a loss to TCU, Blake named Fuente the starting quarterback. Fuente started the next eight games and compiled a 3‚Äì5 record before losing his starting position to Moore following the victory over Oklahoma State. For the year, Fuente completed 91 of 196 passes for 1,271 yards with ten interceptions and eight touchdowns.

The warm waters of the Pacific allowed the system continue to rapidly strengthen, becoming a Category 2 typhoon on August 18. At 8:00 that evening, Typhoon Fred strengthened to a Category 3 typhoon with winds of over (equivalent to a U.S major hurricane). By midnight of August 19, Fred reached Category 4 intensity (winds greater than on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Typhoon Fred reached its maximum intensity of and a minimum central pressure of . Weather reconnaissance flights conducted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicated that Super Typhoon Fred was in great size ‚àí across. By the morning of August 20, as Super Typhoon Fred swiftly bore down Taipei, Taiwan, it was clear that the tropical cyclone was following former scenario. Warnings were issued in Taiwan. However, it turned away and headed for China. It made landfall in China, on August 21, as a strong category 2 typhoon with winds of . The storm caused significant damage and over 1,000 deaths. Super Typhoon Fred dissipated on August 22.  Preparations and impact  In Taiwan, authorities issued evacuation warnings for low-lying areas and flash flood alerts were issued for mountainous communities. However, it turned away and headed straight towards China. The storm made landfall in Zhejiang, on August 21, as a strong category 2 typhoon. High winds and flooding destroyed many buildings. Flooding killed many people. However, the rain relieved severe droughts in China. Damage to farmland, buildings, power lines and roads, and thousands of factory closures, leaves Zhejiang facing an estimated economic loss of $1 billion (1994 USD). Typhoon Fred killed more than 700 people in China's eastern Zhejiang Province and caused damage estimated at $1.16 billion (1994 USD). In total, Fred killed more than 1,000 people in the province.

The attacks, which took place during the October 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, targeted the websites of the National Election Commission (NEC) and then-mayoral candidate Park Won-soon. Investigators assert that the attacks were carried out in hopes of suppressing young voters, to the benefit of the Grand National Party. An aide of Grand National Party legislator Choi Gu-sik was found responsible for the attacks. The attacks The attacks consisted of two separate denial-of-service attacks against independent National Election Commission and mayoral candidate Park Won-soon, carried out with the help of a botnet of 200 infected computers. The attacks were conducted during the morning, when citizens--particularly young voters looking to vote before work--would have been expected to look up polling station locations. It has been theorized that the attacks were conducted in the belief that they may reduce voter turnout, to the benefit of the Grand National Party's candidate Na Kyung-won. Police stated that the attack against the NEC lasted about two hours, specifically impacting the part of the website with information on polling locations; Park Won-soon's website was attacked twice that day. The National Police Agency later revealed that an aide to Grand National Part lawmaker Choi Gu-sik, referred to in the media by only their surname \\"Gong,\\" was responsible for the two attacks. The National Police Agency later arrested Gong and four other associates. Some researchers, however, have questioned the official narrative. Doubts have been raised as to whether Gong had the technical expertise or resources to pull off the attack. Others have pointed out that under a DDoS attack, it would be unusual for parts of a website to be offline while other are online, suggesting perhaps a technical failure instead. These events caused a collective panic amongst GNP members as they often denounce the online activities of South Korean progressives. Political impact The exposure of his role in the attacks led to Choi Gu-sik officially resigning his position as a lawmaker, along with several other members of the GNP. In the wake of the scandal, reformists in the conservative Grand National Party put pressure on core members of the party who were closely affiliated with the Lee Myung-bak government; this in turn led to Park Geun-hye being brought back into the spotlight to reorganize the GNP. Social impact More than 30 university student associations made a joint statement calling for a thorough investigation of the attacks.

Concerned about the high rates of automobile insurance, Pennsylvania enacted mandatory personal injury protection (PIP) insurance coverage in the attempt to reduce the number of lawsuits resulting from automobile accidents.Pennsylvania Insurance Department - auto insurance guide PIP insurance covers the medical bills of drivers involved in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. The idea behind the creation of PIP insurance was that it would reduce the number of ‚Äòpain and suffering‚Äô or ‚Äòloss‚Äô lawsuits, thereby reducing insurance company payouts and ultimately reducing insurance premiums. Individuals who now purchase insurance in Pennsylvania are classified as either ‚Äúlimited tort‚Äù or ‚Äúfull tort.‚Äù Tort is a legal term meaning ‚Äúcivil wrongdoing ‚Äì in civil law, a wrongful act for which damages can be sought by the injured party.‚Äù In Pennsylvania, insurance companies offer full tort coverage which gives covered individuals the ability to sue in court for all damages, and limited tort coverage which ‚Äúlimits‚Äù the ability to sue for pain and suffering. Both full tort and limited tort coverage only apply in situations where the driver or passengers have been injured in an accident that is not the driver's fault. The victim then has the option of bringing charges against the at-fault driver to sue in court for unpaid medical bills, property damage, loss of income, pain, and suffering. Limited tort coverage is less expensive, so it is appealing to consumers as a way to save on their insurance premiums. This option will save approximately 15% in premiums annually. However, by choosing limited tort, consumers give up the ability to sue for ‚Äúpain and suffering‚Äù unless the injuries suffered are considered a \\"serious injury\\" as that term is defined in the standard automobile insurance policy in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, consumers likely will not read these lengthy policies before electing \\"limited tort\\" or \\"full tort\\" and consequently, they could be misled by the terms in the election. In particular, \\"serious injury\\" is defined as \\"death, significant deformity or impairment of body function.\\" As a result, most consumers who elect \\"limited tort\\" believing it is reasonable to only make a claim for \\"pain and suffering\\" if their injury is serious, do not realize that most insurance companies do not consider even permanent injuries to be \\"serious injuries\\" if the consumer is not dead, disfigured or crippled. For example, insurance carriers will deny claim for \\"pain and suffering\\" where the injured victim has suffered a herniated disc or even broken bones.

Merola is a member of the Democratic Party and the current mayor of Bologna. Early life Virginio Merola was born on 14 February 1955 in Santa Maria Capua Vetere in the Province of Caserta in Campania. After a short period in Curti, his family migrated to Bologna, when he was five years old. He attended the classical lyceum Marco Minghetti and than he studied at the University of Bologna, where he graduated in philosophy. Political career During 1970s Merola became a member of the Italian Communist Party, of which Bologna was a solid stronghold. When the PCI was transformed into a social democratic party, the Democratic Party of the Left, Merola joined it. He had been President of Savena district for the PDS from 1995 to 2004, when he was appointed city planning by mayor Sergio Cofferati, a former trade union leader. In 2007 Virginio Merola was one of the founders of the Democratic Party. In 2008 he was candidated to the centre-left primary to become Mayor in 2009 municipal election. The contest was won by University professor and Vice President of Emilia Romagna Flavio Delbono and Merola arrived third with 21.4% of votes. In 2010 Delbono resigned as mayor after the so-called Cinziagate, when the Mayor was being investigated for embezzlement, fraud and aggravated abuse of office following allegations made by his former lover. Delbono's natural heir as mayor was considered Maurizio Cevenini, a famous local politician who has been a long-time member of the city council; but Cevenini suffered an ischemia on October 2010 and renounced to run as new mayor. After Cevenini's withdrawal Merola run again in the primary election against Amelia Frascaroli, a member of Left Ecology Freedom, and Benedetto Zacchiroli, an LGBT activist member of the PD, and won with 58.4% of votes. In 2011 election he led a centre-left coalition against Manes Bernardini, member of the right-wing regionalist Lega Nord, who led the centre-right coalition. Merola won the election in the first round with 50.47% of votes; he is the latest of a long line of left-wing mayors of Bologna. In September 2014 Merola transcribed, along with other centre-left mayor like Ignazio Marino and Giuliano Pisapia, in the civil register the foreign marriages of same-sex couples, which was opposed by Catholic institutions. After the establishment of metropolitan cities, administrative divisions that included a large core city and the smaller surrounding towns that are closely related to it with regard to economic activities and essential public services, on 1 January 2015 Merola became also Metropolitan Mayor of Bologna. In 2016 he run once again as leader of a centre-left coalition against Lucia Borgonzoni, member of Lega Nord, and Massimo Bugani, the candidate of the Five Star Movement. Merola became the most voted candidate in the first round, but gained only 39.5% of votes and did not succeed in being elected in the first round. On 19 June, he won the second round with 54.64% of votes and remained mayor.

With 41 deaths and 42 injured, it was the largest train disaster in Dutch railway history until 1962 when the Harmelen train disaster occurred. The 102 train from Amersfoort to Amsterdam derailed near the railway bridge over the Merwedekanaal near Weesp and dropped off the bank. Various wooden carriages were splintered, causing many casualties in them. Composition The train was composed of two parts; the front carriages came from Zwolle and the rear ones from Enschede. In Hilversum another carriage was hooked on, making a total of 11 carriages, which were pulled by the locomotive HSM 520. The departure time was 9:46 from Amersfoort and 10:10 from Hilversum. According to the schedule the train should have arrived in Amsterdam at 10:40. The disaster While ascending the slope of Weesp station towards the bridge over the Merwedekanaal the dike subsided over a length of 95 metres. This was caused by extensive rain in the preceding time and the poor state of repair of the railway dike. At the moment of the subsidance the locomotive was already on the bridge and thus entangled in the ironworks of the bridge construction. The locomotive and tender flipped to the right. The tender lay on the bridgehead, a luggage wagon next to it came to a standstill against the bridgehead. The following three carriages slid off the slope and shoved into each other. The wooden upperside was largely splintered, causing the most casualties. The third carriage was also engulfed by the luggage carriage on the rear and a postal carriage, which because of the speed partially ended up next to the forward carriages. The carriage behind the postal carriage ended up skewed down from the slope, but was barely damaged. The rear carriages of the train derailed but remained on the tracks. Emergency aid The disaster happened at 10:25. Two minutes before a train from Amsterdam to Hilversum passed. The station chief of Weesp station sounded the alarm at 10:45. A surgeon who happened to be on the train took care of first aid, soon assisted by two doctors rushed in from Weesp. Four nuns also gave aid, as well as soldiers who happened to be in the neighbourhood. There were no victims among the train crew, who also helped shortly after the disaster. At 11:40 the first aid train arrived from Naarden-Bussum followed by accident carriages and carriages for transporting injured from Amsterdam. After that a Red Cross train arrived. At 12:40 the first injured and non-injured passengers were able to leave for Amsterdam. About 2 1/2 hours after the disaster the first injured arrived on an aid train at Muiderpoort station in Amsterdam and were transferred to the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis hospital. Two ships which were sailing on the Merwedekanaal were stopped and they transported injured to the Binnengasthuis in Amsterdam. At 13:30 a tug left with two ships and 36 injured for Amsterdam; half an hour later a ship carrying 32 corpses followed, which arrived at the Wilhelmina Gasthuis at 16:00. Rerouting of train traffic The trains between Amsterdam and Amersfoort were temporarily rerouted through Breukelen and Utrecht. For commuter traffic there were several trains from Naarden-Bussum through Hilversum and Utrecht to Amsterdam. Six days after the disaster, rail traffic resumed over one track with a maximum speed of 5 km/h. After the bridge and dike were repaired both tracks were fully available again on 2 December. Investigation The day after the disaster an investigative commission was instituted under the chairmanship of minister Lely. The investigation concluded that the embankment had been soaked by a prolonged period of rainfall. This was aggravated by the structure of the dike which featured impenetrable layers that the water could not escape through. Also the percolation water from the Merwedekanaal seeped through the loam dikes. The ground water level in the railway dike had therefore risen above ground level. As a result of the passing of the train the embankment vibrated and the more or less liquified dike collapsed and was shoved aside. The disaster instigated the founding of the Laboratorium voor Grondmechanica at the Technische Hogeschool in Delft. Later train accident near Weesp On 19 June, 1953, two passenger trains collided near Weesp, causing at least 2 deaths.

The small restaurant was a celebrity hot spot which received attention for its food as well as an in house radio talk show and lecture series. It closed in November 2000. History The architects for the original restaurant were Michael Rotondi and Thom Mayne. Architectural renovations of the building at 72 Market Street began in 1983, and the restaurant opened its doors for business in August 1984. The concept for 72 Market Street originated in Bill and Moore's desire for a casual fine dining eatery in the beachside neighborhood where they both lived. 72 Market Street received critical praise for Leonard Schwartz's fare of traditional American ‚Äúcomfort food‚Äù. A cookbook detailing its recipes, which included portraits of its celebrity patrons and their involvement in the restaurant, was released in 1998. A lectures series began in 1985, which featured guests including Spalding Gray, Bill Irwin, Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, John Hammond Jr., and sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay. 72 Market Street also partnered with The Paris Review to host an afternoon of readings by authors and poets whose work had been published in their literary review; it including readings by E. L. Doctorow, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Richard Ford, Tess Gallagher, and Raymond Carver. In the late 1980s a live radio program (‚ÄúLive from 72‚Äù) featuring musical entertainment was broadcast live from the restaurant on Sunday evenings on KCRW. Performers on the radio show included Dudley Moore and David Crosby. and featured a trio helmed by house pianist Rafael Nazario. In a 2017 post on a Venice Beach community forum. Tony Bill was cited as saying that the restaurant will open in its original place following the closing of Nikkis. The same location has a release date of March.

Built c. 1750 and supposedly moved to this location in 1765, it is Freeport's oldest surviving building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and is part of the Harraseeket Historic District. The property is owned by the University of Southern Maine. Description and history The Greenfield Pote House is located on Wolfe's Neck, a peninsula across the tidal Harraseeket River from the central parts of Freeport. It is set on the east side of Wolfe's Neck Road, just south of its junction with Burnett Road, and north of Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof that slopes down to the first floor in the rear, giving it a saltbox profile. Its foundation is unmortared fieldstone. It is finished in split cedar shingles, many of which are likely still original. The house was built about 1750 on Falmouth Neck, the peninsula that is now the city of Portland, but was then known as Falmouth. From 1760 it was owned by Captain Greenfield Pote, a ship's captain. After complaints were filed by Falmouth residents that he set sail on the Sabbath, Pote decided to move. In 1765 the house was loaded onto a flatboat, and sailed about down Casco Bay to this area, where it was then moved on rollers to its present location. The interior of the house has had little alteration beyond the introduction of electricity. About 1970 it came into the hands of the Smith family, who were dedicated to its preservation, and who donated the land that became Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park. The barn was restored in 2017‚Äì2018.\\"Wolfe‚Äôs Neck Farm Pote Barn Restoration\\" - HouseandBarnes.com Pote Cemetery The Pote Cemetery is named after Captain Greenfield Pote and is located on private property across the street from the house.

However, as a woman she was not permitted to practice as an attorney; therefore she emigrated to New York, where she taught at a law school she established for women. Emilie Kempin-Spyri was the niece of the author Johanna Spyri.  Life  She matriculated at the University of Z√ºrich in 1883 as the first Swiss woman in the legal faculty. In 1887, she was graduated as the first female Doctor of Law in Europe.Ulrich Kl√∂ti: Rede anl√§sslich der Ehrung durch die Fraum√ºnsterzunft , Z√ºrich 2004. However, she was denied an attorney's charter due to lack of active citizenship. Her proposal before the Bundesgericht (Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland) for a re-interpretation of Article 4 of the Federal Constitution that the concept \\"Swiss citizen\\" could also include women, was rejected as \\"ebenso neu als k√ºhn\\" (just as novel as audacious).BGE 13 I, S. 1 ff., 4 After she was also rejected as a lecturer at the University of Z√ºrich, she emigrated to New York for a brief period, where she established the first women's law college. Due to the homesickness of her husband, Walter Kempin, who was never able to acclimate to New York, the family returned to Switzerland. In 1891 she made a renewed application for acceptance as a lecturer at the University of Z√ºrich. Although the university senate again declined the application, she received the Venia Legendi (the right to lecture) from the education department as an exception. To be sure, she was not able to keep her head above water financially with this occupation. Throughout her life, Kempin-Spyri fought for her admission as an attorney, and was finally broken down by this unsuccessful struggle. Impoverished, she died in Basel in 1901 of uterine cancer. Thanks to Emilie Kempin-Spyri, a new attorney's statute was introduced in Z√ºrich canton in 1898 that allowed women to practice law, in spite of lacking active citizenship. This ruling was first adopted nationwide in 1923. Anna Mackenroth was the first Swiss woman to become an attorney.  Memorials  On April 19, 2004, The Z√ºrich Women's Guild Gesellschaft zu Fraum√ºnster honored Emilie Kempin-Spyri as a Z√ºrich citizen who, in spite of outstanding merit, has fallen into oblivion; the occasion took place under the patronage of the University of Z√ºrich.Ehrung durch die Gesellschaft zu Fraum√ºnster (2004) , Website der Universit√§t Z√ºrich, retrieved 28 June 2009Brigitte Bl√∂chlinger: Postume Ehrung von Emilie Kempin-Spyri , 7 April 2004 The plaque that was unveiled at that time was replaced on May 28, 2009 by a definitive plaque in the foyer of the Bibliothek des Rechtswissenschaftlichen Instituts.Marita Fuchs: Ehrentafel f√ºr die erste Dozentin der Universit√§t Z√ºrich In a ceremony on January 22, 2008, a monument in the form of an oversized chaise longue created by Pipilotti Rist was unveiled in the atrium of the University of Z√ºrich; with this, Kempin-Spyris's role was acknowledged as the first female university lecturer at the University of Z√ºrich, and as a pioneer in equal rights for women.Denkmal von Pipilotti Rist zu Ehren von Emilie Kempin-Spyri (2008) , Website der Universit√§t Z√ºrich, retrieved 28 June 2009NZZ Eine Chaiselongue als Erinnerungsort Emily Kempin-Spyris's life was literarily portrayed in Eveline Hasler's book Die Wachsfl√ºgelfrau.

(c. 1595 ‚Äì c. 1650), was a member of the aristocracy in Ireland who became a Franciscan friar. He served as a teacher and lecturer both locally and on the Continent. He was the Minister Provincial of Ireland during the Irish Confederate Wars, due to which position he communicated on Irish affairs with Franciscans on the European mainland, such as the historian, Friar Luke Wadding. He became involved in the conflict, opposing the excommunications issued by the papal nuncio in 1648. He last appears in documents dated July 1649. Biography Barnewall was the son of Robert Barnewall, 7th Baron Trimlestown (died 1639), and a brother of Matthias Barnewall, 8th Baron Trimlestown (died 1667). His mother was Genet Talbot, daughter of Thomas Talbot of Dardistown Castle, County Meath. The family was a significant member of the Old English gentry in The Pale of County Meath, having come over from England with King Henry II. One ancestor, John Barnewall, 3rd Baron Trimlestown (died 1538), was Lord Chancellor of Ireland. John Barnewall went to the Continent and entered the Franciscan Order, going on to receive minor orders and then the subdiaconate at Mechelin, in the then- Spanish Netherlands, in December 1617. No documentation survives, but presumably he received further Holy Orders during the following months. He defended his theses in Scotist theology at Louvain in 1620, and again in 1627. He is believed to have taught as a lecturer in Germany in 1637, as well as subsequently at Prague, and at Slane in County Meath upon his return to Ireland. Among his students was the historian, Friar Peter Walsh. A contemporary stated that Barnewall taught philosophy and theology at Louvain for eight years prior to his election as Minister Provincial of Ireland at Quin, County Clare, on 15 August 1638. A letter he wrote to Wadding, dated 1 November 1642, confirms that he was still Minister Provincial at that date. In 1648 he opposed the excommunications issued by papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, of the members of the Supreme Council of the Confederation of Kilkenny. In July 1649 he was at Kilkenny, where he joined by the Franciscan guardians of his province in their condemnation of Friar Redmond Caron, who had been appointed Visitor to Ireland by Friar Pierre Marchant, who was a Definitor General of the Order, at the suggestion of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. There are no further known documentary references to Barnewall after this date.

The lobster louse was first reported in 1826 by Audoin & Milne-Edwards. N. astaci has been found on lobsters inhabiting locations including Scotland, Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel and as far south as France and Portugal. The louse possesses a narrow suctorial mouthpart to feed on host haemolymph. Internally, In its adult form, Nicothoe is barely mobile and most likely remains in the same position for most of its life. The parasite occurs in groups, particularly near the base of the gills, and study has gone into its effects on the lobsters, which are considerably important, commercially. Not much is known about its life cycle, since there are significant gaps in knowledge of certain stages of its growth. Description Female The adult female consists of three parts, the cephalothorax, a thorax bearing two large lateral expansions or wings, and the abdomen which is responsible for carrying two oval egg-sacs. The female Nicothoe astaci abdomen tip measures , and each wing measures long. The eggs sacs that are located in the abdomen measure up to in length. The head is fused to the first two segments, three other segments are visible dorsoventrally by three rings and are important in the formation of the wings. The wings interact with the posterior edge and the sixth thoracic segment which is fused to the first abdominal segment. The adult female has a complete set of segments and limbs, and is considered to be a modification of, rather than a degeneration from its usual copepod form. Male The female Nicothoe astaci is the only individual to be definitely recognised, described and figured by scientists. Some female specimens have been studied and placed under the category of a male but have been traced to not be in the species. However, many wingless specimens have been found and observed in the lab to be analyzed. Specimens having full complement segments were described to be sexually mature males. Males and females at the larval stage either develop wings or stay wingless. The males mature without wings and the females become sexually mature with wings. Furthermore, several specimens have been studied in various stages of development and have been found to contain testes in the thorax and genital segment. The development of males occurs as cyclopids during the gap in the life history between cyclopid and last copepod stages. Male Nicothoe astaci do not settle on the lobster while females are present on the lobster during their final stage. Life cycle Nicothoe larvae are released from the egg-sacs into surrounding water. These are cyclopid larvae. The morphology of a first-stage larva includes full mouthparts, two pairs and rudimentary third pair of legs, and a sucking mouth tube. The cephalothorax is as long as the rest of the body and some legs are free. There is a gap in knowledge of the life cycle of this parasite. It is unknown if this species requires any intermediate hosts; the earliest stage of Nicothoe seen on lobster gills was a last-stage copepodid. This last stage resembles the adult except for the absence of wings and egg-sacs. Growth continues, with a whole succession of juvenile stages, at which wings and gonads develop. Once the wings have reached a length of , eggs are forced out of the gonads into egg-sacs and it is at which the organism becomes an adult. The series of changes in the reproductive system of the juvenile and adult Nicothoe are divided into six stages: *Immature ‚Äì No development of ovaries are externally visible in juvenile; adult ovaries are empty or with few residual eggs. *Egg-sacs contain spherical eggs. *Developing ‚Äì Ovaries become externally visible as granular with no definite oocytes visible. Larvae are in egg-sacs. *Half-full ‚Äì Ovaries are darker with oocytes externally visible. Young oocytes and dividing oogonia can be seen. Larvae in egg-sacs are showing signs of segmentation. *Full ‚Äì Ovaries are large and full with plots of oognia and oocytes (few are young). Larvae are showing rudimentary limbs. *Ripe ‚Äì Ovaries appear dense. Eggs are closely packed together and showing signs of maturation. Egg-sacs are full of cyclopid larvae with mouthparts and swimming legs. Fertilization by sperm occurs before the eggs enter the egg-sacs and the development into embryos happens once the egg-sacs are full of eggs. At this point, the ovaries have already begun forming new eggs. *Spawning ‚Äì Old egg- sacs are lost and larvae is released. New egg-sacs are being formed and the cycle is repeated. Feeding mechanism The feeding mechanism of the female Nicothoe astaci has been studied extensively. The parasite feeds upon the haemolymph (blood) of the lobster by attaching to the gill filament using its circular ('oral disc') mouthparts and limbs. Recent cryo-scanning electron microscopy has revealed structural adaptations that facilitate attachment of these parasites to the gill filaments of their lobster host. It is thought that sharp mandibles pierce the wall of the gill filament before the suctorial oral disc attaches to the gill, which in conjunction with an observed peristaltic mechanism of the stomach, ensures a ‚Äòvacuum seal‚Äô to the host, extracting haemolymph to be ingested. The aperture of the feeding channel, through which host haemolymph is drawn, is only approximately 5 micrometers in diameter.  Host response  The effect of Nicothoe astaci upon the host European lobster has only recently been studied. Internally, lobsters respond to the parasite by encapsulating haemocytes in an attempt to partition off damaged gill areas, and Wootton et al. (2011) hypothesized that this response may impair gill respiratory function. Various haemolymph factors can provide a general health indicator of crustaceans. For example, haemolymph levels of hyperglycaemic hormone, proteins, haemocyanin levels, nitrogenous wastes (including ammonia, urea and ureic acid) and glucose change in response to environmental stressors such as temperature, salinity and hypoxia, as well as to physiological stressors such as moult stage and exogenous stressors such as temperature, handling, disease and parasitization. The data suggest that lobsters with gills damaged by the feeding activities of N. astaci respond by producing higher levels of haemocyanin, which is both a key defence response and may compensate for their decreased respiratory functioning (i.e. to bolster the oxygen transport capability of haemolymph). Lobster moults The most important moulting season of the lobster in Scottish waters occurs between May and August. Male lobster cast their exoskeleton every year while female cast their exoskeleton every other year. It is important for Nicothoe astaci to enter the gills while the exoskeleton is soft right after the moult. Any further hardening of the exoskeleton prevents female Nicothoe astaci from attaching to the gills. If the gills are soft, the parasite is able to pierce its mandibles on the gills to attach. This enables the female to feed on the host's blood which leads to the formation and growth of their wings.

Coffee furanone is less odorous than furfuryl mercaptan, which with an odor threshold of 0.005 ppb was the first high impact aroma chemical, but has a very pleasant sweet caramel character, with some nuttiness.Leo M. L. Nollet, Terri Boylston, \\"Handbook of meat, poultry and seafood quality\\" page 137-138 (2007)  Synthesis  Coffee furnone was synthesized in 1963 by Wynberg via acid-catalyzed ring closure of Œ≤-alkoxy diazoketones. Coffee furanone has also been prepared via the condensation of ethyl lactate and methyl acrylate in DMSO solution and (under phase transfer conditions) in ionic liquids. A related lactic acid synthesis was described as having the advantages of a simple process, high conversion rate, low pollution, and low cost.Cunzhao Cheng \\"Synthesis method of natural flavoring 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-3-one\\", Zhuanli Shenging Gonkai Shuomingshu, CN Patent 2009:1544311 (2009) This compound has also been prepared in acceptable yield via oxidative hydroxylation of the 2-acetylbutyrolactone. Further approaches to the synthesis of coffee furanone involved the hydrolysis of the corresponding dithioketals and the oxidation of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran employing lithium hypochlorite in the presence of ruthenium catalysts.  Applications  The synthetic version of this natural flavorant and odorant is used in a variety of food and beverage applications, including coffee, nuts, cocoa, brandy, meat sauces and as a general food flavorant at a typical dosage (about 5-20 ppm), similar to the natural concentration (30 ppm) of coffee furanone in roasted coffee.

The weapon was designed with extreme short-range stopping power in mind for FSB urban combat units. According to the Russian press, the first batch of ShAK-12 battle rifles were delivered to the FSB in late 2011. Overview The ShAK-12 is a dedicated \\"Close/Urban combat\\" weapon for high-risk law enforcement operations, which must combine high stopping power with limited penetration and a short 'dangerous range', to avoid collateral damage to innocent bystanders or hostages. To achieve these goals, the designers of the ShAK-12 developed special large-calibre ammunition, loaded with a variety of bullets. The ammunition used for the ShAK-12 is the 12.7√ó55mm straight-walled, rimless brass case based on .338 Lapua Magnum, originally developed by the same organization that developed the silenced VKS sniper rifle.12,7—Ö55 –°–¶-130 Standard loading for the ShAK-12 is a lightweight, subsonic ammunition with an aluminium core, exposed at the front and hollowed at the rear and partially enclosed into a bi-metal jacket. The cartridge has a bullet weight of 48.14-76.08 grams and a muzzle velocity of 290‚Äì315 metres per second. It has several loadings; light, heavy and a duplex load with two light bullets. This new Russian cartridge bears certain conceptual similarities to a family of big-bore cartridges developed in the US for the AR-15 platform, such as .458 SOCOM, .499 LWR or .50 Beowulf, although the Russian cartridge uses a longer case and generally a heavier bullet load. Its US counterparts are usually loaded with bullets weighing 19 grams and up.  Design  The ShAK-12 features a bullpup layout, with a stamped steel receiver and a polymer housing/stock. It has a short recoil operated system, which means after it fires the round, the barrel slides backwards ands eject the spent shell casing. It is unknown what kind of locking system it uses, however it most likely uses a 2 or 3 lug rotating bolt. Firing controls include two separate levers; a fire mode selector (Semi/Auto) at the rear and an ambidextrous safety (Safe/Fire) above the pistol grip. There are several configurations of the basic rifle. The first one features an integral carrying handle with a built-in rear diopter sight and a folding front sight. A length of Picatinny rail is installed on the carrying handle to accept various optical sights. Another version that was observed on some photos features a \\"flat top\\" configuration with a Picatinny rail running on top of the receiver, as well as front and rear sights installed on folding bases. Other variations have a Picatinny rail below the fore end or a 40mm underbarrel grenade launcher. Muzzle devices include a muzzle brake or a quickly-detachable suppressor. The equipment of the Russian law enforcement with the advanced ShAK-12 battle rifles is underway.https://sputniknews.com/military/201812131070638043-russia-weapons- super-gun-defence/ Ammunition *12,7x55mm –õ–µ–≥–∫–∞—è –ü—É–ª—è (Legkaya Pulya (LP) > \\"Light Bullet\\") [Bullet Weight: 7 grams (108 grains)] Light supersonic saboted lead bullet with an aluminum core. *12,7x55mm –¢—è–∂–µ–ª–∞—è –ü—É–ª—è (Tyazhelaya Pulya (TP) > \\"Heavy Bullet\\") [Bullet Weight: 33 gram (509 grains)] Heavy subsonic lead bullet. *12,7x55mm –î–≤—É—Ö–ø—É–ª—å–Ω—ã–π (Dvukhpul'niy (DP) > \\"Double-Bulleted\\", \\"Duplex Bullet\\") [Bullet Weight: 17 grams (262 grains) each] Two bullets loaded inline. *12,7x55mm –ë—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–±–æ–π–Ω–∞—è –ü—É–ª—è (Broneboynaya Pulya (BP) > \\"Armor- Piercing Bullet\\") [Bullet Weight: 18 grams (277 grains)] Lead bullet with an armor-piercing core.

Anzald√∫a. The letter was drafted in 1979 and was published in Anzald√∫a‚Äôs feminist anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981). Writing this essay in the format of a letter, Anzaldua urges the reader to ‚Äúwrite from the body‚Äù and she connects her body to other bodies, creating a community of embodied people. This essay is addressed to women of color as she shows sympathy, encouragement, and words of wisdom towards them. The essay addresses women of color and encourages these women to make their personal, embodied experiences visible in the text. The reader must also allow the text to enter herself, if the reader chooses to enter the text.  Impact  The essay encourages women of color to write and theorize about their lives, and allowing women to think about their race, sex, gender, class realities and histories, and reclaiming their right to write. She also wants women to reclaim themselves since mainstream society has made women of color the ‚Äòother‚Äô, and writing takes on that task that which society alienated them from. Anzald√∫a even says in her speech that writing keeps her spirit alive and revolt, and writing compensates for what the real world of her time deprives her from. She states that writing allows her to accept who she is and reclaiming that for herself. Writing introduces at power that when women of color write, it gives them power, and a woman with power is feared. And when women come together and share their writing with one another, a community is created. This community dispels all loneliness and sense of powerlessness, but Anzald√∫a explains that it, ‚Äú‚Ä¶propels [her] to leap into a timeless, spaceless no place where [she] can forget [herself] and feel [she‚Äôs] the universe. This is power‚Äù. She closes her essay saying to ignore the rules and the ways of society and to allow the voice that lies within yourself to come out and sell it. Anzald√∫a‚Äôs speech received responses from people of different sexualities, rape survivors, and people of color. Her speech opened up the eyes of African American and Latina professors who suffered from self-doubt and self-hate caused by racism and sexism. Anzald√∫a‚Äôs style of writing and speech was used to describe Linda Kerber‚Äôs keynote address to the American Studies Association. Kerber addressed the rise of a new disciplinary identity which was founded upon the paradigm of diversity. Her work became the path for those who needed the guidance.

Castle Semple Collegiate Church is located in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is situated near the eastern end of Castle Semple Loch, within Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park, and west of Howwood on the B787, then on to the B776. The late Gothic church is under the protection of Historic Environment Scotland as a Scheduled monument. History John Sempill, 1st Lord Sempill founded the collegiate church near Castle Semple, in circa 1504. It had a provost, six chaplains or prebendaries, two boys, and a sacristan. James IV of Scotland visited John's house at Eliotston and the collegiate church on 26 July 1505. The king gave an offering of 14 shillings in the \\"New College.\\"Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.3 (1901), p.xviii, 62 A stone in the outer wall bears the letters R. L. S., and the arms of Sempill and Montgomerie. The church is in length; in width; and in height. Its walls are covered with ivy. The roof was removed in the 1800s, and the ivy has penetrated into the interior. In ancient times, there appears to have been a village at this place, and a chapel in its neighbourhood dedicated to St. Bride. Design and architecture Interior view, Castle Semple Collegiate Church. The building is a simple oblong, terminating toward the east in a three-sided apse, and having a square tower projecting from the centre of the west wall. The forms of the double windows indicate that they are very late survivals of Gothic architecture. The other windows in the side walls are altered, but they do not present any features like those of the apse. Over the door to the chancel are two coats of arms with the letters R. L. S. and A. M. S., one shield bearing the Sempill arms and the other those of Montgomerie. The square tower at the west end is extremely simple. The tower and most of the side walls are of about the date of the original foundation, while the east apse has been added in the 16th century, to receive the monument of John, Lord Sempill, who died at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. A few remains of the original squareheaded windows in the side walls are still traceable. The interior was divided by two solid walls into three compartments, so as to form separate private burial places. In the eastern compartment, there is a large monument to Lord Sempill. A monumental slab in the central compartment is erected in memory of Gabriel Sempel, who died in 1587. References * This article includes text incorporated from A.

It is clear in the vast majority of species that as running speed increases the energetic cost of running increases.Margaria, R., Cerretelli, P., Aghemo, P., Sassi, G., 1963. Energy cost of running. J. Appl. Physiol. 18, 367‚Äì370.Menier and Pugh, 1968 D.R. Menier and L.G.C.E. Pugh, The relation of oxygen intake and velocity of walking and running in competition walkers. J. Physiol.

Katch and V.L. Katch, Exercise Physiology: Energy, Nutrition, and Human Performance, (fifth ed.), Lippincott, Williams and Wilkens, New York (2001). It also has long been known that between and within species variability exists in the energy cost of running a given speed. This variability has led to the study of biomechanical or physiological factors that may be predictive of the energy cost to run both between and within species. In humans there is evidence that the cost to run at a given speed may be predictive of endurance performance. As a result, it has become common to examine the factors that influence the energy cost of running in an attempt to predict or improve running performance. There are many factors that may affect the energy cost of running, including age, training, stride rate and frequency, shoe weight, wind resistance, and even air density.Daniels, J., Daniels, N., 1992. Running economy of elite male and elite female runners. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 24, 483‚Äì489. Quantifying and expressing running energetics The energetic cost of running can be quantified through the measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2). during running at a given submaximal speed. During aerobic activities (like submaximal running), VO2 provides an indirect estimate of energy expenditure. As a result, an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption is representative of an increase in energy expenditure. VO2 is often measured in absolute terms (ex. Liters/min), but in weight bearing activities, such as running, body mass can have a profound influence on energy expenditure. As a result, it is common to express energy expenditure as the rate of oxygen consumption in relation to body mass (ex. ml/kg/min). Though some recent data may suggest otherwise,Steudel-Numbers, K., Wall- Scheffler, C., 2009. Optimal running speed and the evolution of hominin hunting strategies. Journal of Human Evolution. 56, 355‚Äì360. it is traditionally well accepted that a strong linear relationship exists between the rate of oxygen consumption and running speed (see figure 1), with energy expenditure increasing with increasing running speed. It is important that the measurement of energy expenditure through oxygen consumption is obtained at submaximal intensities. As running speed is increased to very high relative intensities, VO2 measures become a less reliable measure of energy expenditure. This is due to an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism to provide the energy to run at these fast speeds. There are many ways to express the energy cost of running. It is common to express the energetic cost of running as the energy cost to travel a given distance. This measure is often referred to as the cost of transport (COT). COT can be expressed in many ways. Two common methods of expressing COT are as oxygen consumed over a given distance (ex. ml/kg/km) or caloric energy expenditure over a given distance (ex. kcal/kg/km). Comparative Running Energetics: Scaling of energetic cost of running Over the years, many factors have been examined in order to explain variation in running energy expenditure across species. Some of these factors were examined well over a century ago when Zuntz discovered in 1897 that the energetic cost of animals of similar mass to run a given distance was independent of limb number. In other words, there is no difference in the energetic cost to run a given distance as a quadruped or as a biped provided the animals are similar in body weight.Zuntz, N. (1897). Uber den Stoffverbrauch des Hundes bei Muskelarbeit. Arch. ges. Physiol. 68, 191‚Äì211. Since Zuntz, a large amount of evidence has suggested that the COT decreases in direct proportion to body weight, with larger animals exhibiting a lower COT than smaller animals.Roberts, T., Kram, R., Weyand, P., Taylor, CR., 1998. Energetics of bipedal running. I. Metabolic cost of generating force.J Exp Biol 201, 2745-2751. More recently, it has been proposed that an accurate prediction of the energy cost of running at a given speed can be made from the time available to generate force to support body weight.Kram, R., Taylor, CR., 1990. Economy of running: a new perspective. Nature. 346, 265 ‚Äì 267 This theory suggests that smaller animals must take shorter, quicker steps to travel a given distance than larger animals. As a result, they have shorter foot ground contact times and less time to produce force on the ground. Due to this decreased amount of time to produce force, smaller animals must rely more heavily on metabolically costly fast muscle fibers to produce force to run at a given speed. Conversely, larger animals take slower and longer steps, contributing to an increase in the amount of time the foot is in contact with the ground during running. This longer contact time allows larger animals a greater amount of time to produce force. As a result, larger animals do not recruit as many metabolically costly fast muscle fibers in order to run a given speed. All of these factors result in a greater COT in smaller animals in comparison to larger animals. There is some evidence that differences in COT across speed exist between species. It has been observed that quadrupeds exhibit optimal speeds within gaits.Hoyt, D., Taylor, C. Gait and the energetics of locomotion in horses. Nature. 292, 239-240. Meaning that there are speeds at which the energetic cost to run a given distance is minimized. In humans, it is commonly thought that the COT remains constant across all submaximal running speeds, though a recent study has challenged this assumption. If this is true, the energetic cost of running a mile fast or slow in humans is the same, and no optimal speed of running exists for humans. Between humans there is a great deal of individual variability observed in energy expenditure during running at a given submaximal speed. A multitude of factors have been shown to exert an influence on the cost of human running. As a result, the apparent variability in the cost of human running may be a result of a variety of factors (see Running Economy/Introduction section). Some have suggested that sex may have an influence on the cost of running. Though there is some evidence that sex can influence the energetic cost of human running, especially among elite distance runners,Chapman R., Layman A., Wilhite, D., McKenzie, J., Tanner, D., Stager, J. Ground contact time as an indicator of metabolic cost in elite distance runners. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., 2011. differences in the energetic cost of running on the basis of sex are largely unclear.Davies, C., Thompson, M. Aerobic performance of female marathon and male ultramarathon athletes. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 41:233-245, 1979.Hagan, R., Strathman, L., Gettman, L. Oxygen uptake and energy expenditure during horizontal treadmill running. J Appl. Physiol. 49:571-575, 1980. Running economy The energy cost of running between individuals is extremely variable, even when normalized for body mass. This suggests that a variety of other factors must influence the energy cost of running. The apparent individual variability of energy expenditure during running spurred the development of the concept of economy. Economy is defined as the energy expended to meet the aerobic demands of a given submaximal activity. A measure of running economy should allow for comparison of the energy cost of running between individuals or groups of individuals. If an individual expends less energy to perform a given task (in the case of running, to run a given speed) they are considered more economical. Measures of economy There are many ways to compare economy between individuals. It is common to compare the energy expended to run at a given fixed speed, usually by measuring oxygen consumed while running at a fixed speed (ml/kg/min).Fletcher, J., Esau, S., MacIntosh, B., 2009. Economy of Running: beyond the measurement of oxygen uptake. J Appl Physiol 107:1918-1922. This method does provide a comparison of economy at this given speed, but may often not provide an adequate representation of economy as a predictor of performance. This is especially true when comparing well-trained runners to untrained or lesser-trained individuals. In these cases comparing energy expenditure (as oxygen consumption) at a fixed speed often does not provide a comparison of energy expenditure at race pace. Because oxygen consumption increases with speed, it is difficult to get a precise depiction of economy from measuring oxygen consumption at a single speed. As a result, it is common to measure oxygen consumption across a wide range of speeds within individuals in order to get a more accurate assessment of economy. It is also common to measure the cost of transport (COT), or the energetic cost to travel a given distance, in order to make comparisons of economy between individuals. Because this value is thought to remain constant across speed, the measurement of the COT at any single fixed submaximal speed is thought to provide an adequate representation of an individual's economy. This would allow for comparisons of economy to be made between untrained individuals running at their preferred submaximal speed (for example, 161 m/min, ~6 mph) to well-trained runners running at their preferred submaximal speed (for example, 268‚Äì320 m/min, ~10-12 mph). For this reason, it is common to use the COT in order to compare running economy between groups of different training and performance levels. Factors influencing running economy There are many factors that may influence running economy. One factor that has consistently been observed to influence the energy expenditure (and thus economy) during running, is training status. Well-trained runners are often found to be significantly more economical than untrained individuals. Also, performance level has been observed to influence the energy expenditure of running at a given speed, even within groups of trained runners. For example, elite runners are often more economical than sub-elite or average runners.Morgan, D et al., 1995.Variation in the aerobic demand among trained and untrained subjects. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. Vol. 27, No. 3, 404-409. This suggests that running economy, or the energy cost of running at a given submaximal speed, may be a valid predictor of performance especially within homogeneous groups of trained runners. There is also evidence that intense endurance training can improve economy within an individual.Jones, A., 2006. The physiology of the world record holder for the women‚Äôs marathon.

Early life Edgar Amos Love was born September 10, 1891, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. His father, the Rev. Julius C. Love, was a widely respected minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church. His mother, Susie Love (n√©e Carr), was also a licensed minister and the first woman to graduate from Morgan College. Due to the pastoral obligations of his father, Edgar spent portions of his childhood in parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. He was one of seven children. Education Love graduated from the Academy of Morgan College (Baltimore) in 1909 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Howard University in 1913. In 1916 Love attained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from the Howard Divinity School, after which he matriculated to the Boston University School of Theology, obtaining his Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1918. Founding of Omega Psi Phi On November 17, 1911, Love and two other Howard students, Oscar James Cooper and Frank Coleman, established the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. They enlisted the guidance of Ernest Everett Just to assist them in their endeavor. Omega Psi Phi Fraternity was the first black fraternity founded on a black campus. The young men selected Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift as their Cardinal Principles. Love was a charter member for Howard's Alpha Chapter on December 15, 1911 and served two non-consecutive terms as Grand Basileus (President). Career During World War I, Love spent fourteen months overseas, serving as a chaplain in the United States Army. Upon honorable discharge he became a professor at Morgan College for two years, devoting additional time as the school‚Äôs athletic director. It is in this time that Love met and married Virginia L. Ross on June 16, 1923. Their union would produce one son, Jon E. Love. After leaving Morgan, Love upheld the tradition of his parents and embarked on a career as a Methodist minister. He guided various congregations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland; the most prominent being John Wesley Church in Baltimore. In 1933 Love was tapped as District Superintendent of the Washington Conference of the Methodist Church. This, along with his appointment to lead the Methodist Department of Negro Work in 1940, proved to be a stepping stone to his election on June 22, 1952 as Bishop of the segregated Central Conference (Baltimore area) of the Methodist Church. Bishop Love presided in this capacity for twelve years. He emerged from retirement from November, 1966 through June, 1967 to serve as Bishop of the Atlantic Coast Area, which at the time spanned churches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. Civic Life and Professional Affiliations All the while maintaining his leadership in the Methodist church, Bishop Love was as a trustee for numerous black colleges and universities, including his beloved Morgan. He also served on the Maryland Inter-Racial Commission under Gov. Albert C. Ritchie. In addition to his life membership in the NAACP, Bishop Love belonged to a variety of professional societies, including the Prince Hall Free Masons (having been a founding member of Corinthian Lodge #18 in Washington, D.C.), Sigma Pi Phi, the Benevolent and Improved Benevolent Protective Order of Elks of the World, Frontiers Clubs of America, and the American Legion.

Western restaurants began to appear in China during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era which was when Chinese people began to experiment putting tomatoes into their dishes. This was particularly prominent around Shanghai which was the most cosmopolitan Chinese city at the time. In the 1920s and 1930s, stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs was sold at restaurants. It was around the 1940s that records of the home-cooked style stir-fried tomato and scrambled egg dish emerged. Preparation Cooking the dish Scramble eggs (usually into large curds) and set aside. Stir fry wedged tomatoes til tender and put the eggs back into the heat together with the tomatoes. Stir till both eggs and tomatoes are done.

Its headwaters are located on the western slopes of the Tehachapi Mountains, and it flows northwest into the southern San Joaquin Valley. History Arroyo de Tej√≥n (Tejon Creek), the canyon and stream, along with the pass through it and over the Tehachapi Mountains, were named with Tej√≥n (Spanish: badger) after a dead badger was found at the canyon's mouth by Lt. Francisco Ruiz in 1806. The Spanish military expedition led by Ruiz was exploring inland routes to the San Joaquin Valley and 'upper' settled Alta California, via the deserts from colonial New Spain (present day Mexico). Along the creek and south of it the land grant Rancho Tej√≥n was established in 1843. Lieutenant Robert Stockton Williamson of the Pacific Railroad Survey Expedition surveyed the area in 1853, setting up his Depot Camp along the creek, on the land of the Rancho Tej√≥n. The Sebastian Indian Reservation (Tejon Indian Reservation), the first Indian reservation in California, was established along Tejon Creek in 1853. It existed for 9 years, until the treaty was revoked by the U.S. government in 1864. The Tejon Passes =Old Tejon Pass= The ancient native trail now known as Old Tejon Pass was \\"discovered\\" in 1772 by Spanish explorer Pedro Fages,Smith, Jedediah S., [Harrison G. Rogers], and George R. Brooks (ed.). The Southwest Expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His Personal Account of the Journey to California, 1826‚Äì1827. Lincoln and London, University of Nebraska Press, [1977] 1989, p134-5. and used in 1776 by padre Francisco Garces, traveling east of the Anza Colonizing Expedition's main route. It is to the northeast of the present day Tejon Pass, in the Tehachapi Mountains, at the top of the divide between Tejon Creek Canyon in the San Joaquin Valley and Cottonwood Creek Canyon in the Antelope Valley of the western Mojave Desert. In 1806, Lt. Francisco Ruiz named it Tej√≥n Pass while on an expedition into the San Joaquin Valley. Ruiz also named Tejon Canyon and Tejon Creek, all after the dead badger (tej√≥n) he had found at the canyon mouth. Later the El Camino Viejo, a Spanish and Mexican inland route from the Pueblo de Los Angeles northward, crossed the western Antelope Valley from Elizabeth Lake to Cottonwood Creek, and then crossed the Tehachapi Mountains at Old Tejon Pass, following Tejon Creek down into the San Joaquin Valley. Gold Rush 49ers, and early emigrants and teamsters followed this route. The Five Joaquins Gang used the route over the pass to drive their droves of stolen and wild horses southward to Sonora.Frank F. Latta, Joaquin Murrieta and His Horse Gangs, Bear State Books. Santa Cruz, California. 1980. xv,685 pages. Illustrated with numerous photos. Index. Photographic front end-papers. It was described in 1853, by an Army Topographic Engineer, Lieutenant Robert Stockton Williamson as \\"one of the worst roads he ever saw.\\" In an oak grove along the middle reach of the creek, on Rancho El Tejon, was the site of the Depot Camp of Williamson's Pacific Railroad expedition while it surveyed the passes into the San Joaquin Valley as possible routes for the railroad. Harrison Irving Scott, The Ridge Route: the Long Road to Preservation; California HISTORIAN, www.californiahistorian.com website, accessed November 14, 2011 , \\"The name Tejon formerly belonged to another pass 15 miles further east. Lieutenant Robert Stockton Williamson of the Pacific Railroad Survey Expedition surveyed the area in 1853. His party crossed the Tehachapis by \\"one of the worst roads he ever saw.\\" Hearing of a better road further west, he scouted it and found it would be far more practicable for wagons if the bulk of the traffic henceforth went that way. The name Tejon was transferred west to Fort Tejon Pass, present day Tejon Pass. =Fort Tejon Pass ‚Äî Tejon Pass= Williamson much preferred as a wagon route the lower and easier Grapevine Canyon to the west that led to a pass between the Tehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains. Following this discovery and the construction of Fort Tejon, wagon traffic soon changed to the easier Grapevine route named Fort Tejon Pass. The new Stockton - Los Angeles Road used it, and the Old Tejon Pass route was gradually abandoned. The name Tejon Pass was transferred west following the closure of Fort Tejon, when \\"Fort\\" was dropped from the Fort Tejon Pass name. The (Old) Tejon Pass eventually was so unused that it lost its name altogether on maps.  Sinks of Tejon Station In 1858, the Butterfield Overland Mail 1st Division established the Sinks of Tejon Station at the mouth of Tejon Creek, west of Comanche Point. There at the Sinks of Tejon, the creek's waters sank into the ground of the San Joaquin Valley here during the dry season, instead of reaching Kern Lake. The Butterfield Overland Mail (1857-1861) stagecoaches' next stations were: Kern River Slough Station located to the northeast; and Fort Tejon Station located to the southwest.

These structures may receive synaptic input, and can develop into dendritic spines. Dendritic filopodia are generally less-well studied than dendritic spines because their transient nature makes them difficult to detect with traditional microscopy techniques. Sample preparation can also destroy dendritic filopodia. However, it has been determined that filopodia on dendritic shafts are distinct from other types of filopodia (even those found in dendritic growth cones) and may react to stimuli in different ways.Portera-Cailliau C, Pan DT, Yuste, R. 2003. Activity-Regulated Dynamic Behavior of Early Dendritic Protrusions: Evidence for Different Types of Dendritic Filopodia. J. Neurosci. 23(18):7129-7141 Structure Dendritic filopodia are thin and hairlike. They are defined as having a length that is at least twice the width, and they do not display the bulbous head found on dendritic spines. Filopodia are devoid of most cellular organelles, and are composed primarily of actin cytoskeletal elements. Synaptic contacts may occur along the length of the filopodia, not only at the end.Fiala JC, Feinberg M, Popov V, Harris KM. 1998. Synaptogenesis via dendritic filopodia in developing hippocampal area CA1. J. Neurosci. 18(21):8900-11. Role in Synaptic Transmission Dendritic filopodia may be the site of synapses in certain regions of the nervous system. In some neuronal cell types, such as in rat retinal ganglion cells, dendritic spines are not present, suggesting that in these cases, synaptogenesis occurs primarily on dendritic shafts or on filopodia themselves. Filopodia may synapse with neighboring axons both along the length of the filopodium and at the tip. Synaptic activity on dendritic filopodia may alter their morphology, or induce their transformation into dendritic spines (see transformation into spines.) Role in Development In the early stages of neural development, dendritic shafts are overwhelmingly populated by dendritic filopodia. Gradually, the number of filopodia begin to decline concordant with a rise in spine number.Takahashi H, Sekino Y, Tanaka S, Mizui T, Kishi S, Shirao T. 2003. Drebrin-dependent actin clustering in dendritic filopodia governs synaptic targeting of postsynaptic density-95 and dendritic spine morphogenesis. J. Neurosci. 2003 Jul 23;23(16):6586-95. Eventually, spines become the dominant structure on dendritic shafts with only a few filopodia present. Filopodia seem to grow in response to localized pulses of glutamate, suggesting that they may play a role in directing dendritic branching. Transformation into Spines Dendritic filopodia can be readily observed transforming into dendritic spines. It has been proposed that filopodia may represent the precursors to dendritic spines and that their transience and motility may allow for selection of synaptic partners. Selection of synaptic partners may be dependent on detected synaptic activity in the vicinity of the filopodium. Localized glutamate signaling in the area of dendritic filopodia causes an increase in filopodial length, whereas blocking glutamate receptors reduces numbers of dendritic filopodia. Therefore, dendritic filopodia may be used by post-synaptic cells to detect passing axons. After contact between dendritic filopodium and a neighboring axon has been established, the filopodium retracts and the head begins to swell, taking on a more spine-like morphology. At this stage, the synapse is considered to be matured, and is perceived as more stable. Although dendritic filopodia have been observed becoming dendritic spines, the process through which this occurs is unknown. Studies have reported that filopodia may undergo more than one stage of development before becoming spines, and that clustering of certain proteins such as Drebrin may be used to identify the maturity of filopodia. Mature spines contain enrichments of PSD95 protein at their spine heads, and PSD95 is often used as an indicator of spine maturity. However, dendritic filopodia can take on spine-like morphologies even without post-synaptic density proteins, pointing to actin remodeling as the primary process responsible for the development of spines from filopodia. Cytoskeletal analyses of spines versus filopodia have found that a spine-like morphology is associated with higher numbers of branched actin filaments. Therefore, proteins that interact with the arp2/3 complex as well as F-actin are under investigation for involvement in this process. Because filopodia are also sensitive to local concentrations of glutamate, proteins that interact with NMDA receptors in dendritic filopodia are also candidates for regulation of this process. Role in Synaptic Plasticity Studies have shown that on mature dendritic stretches, NMDAR-mediated synaptic activity can spur the outgrowth of new filopodia, which can later develop into mature spine synapses.Cohen-Cory, Susana. 2002. The Developing Synapse: Construction and Modulation of Synaptic Structures and Circuits. Science 298 770-776. This finding represents a possible role for dendritic filopodia in synaptic plasticity because filopodia may serve as precursors to mature synapses even in mature neurons. Role in Disease Although dendritic filopodia do not play a clear role in any particular disease, abnormally high numbers of filopodia have been found in the brains of patients with Autism spectrum disorders. This high-filopodia, low-spine phenotype may be due to failure of the filopodia to mature properly into spines. Mutations in the gene SHANK3 have been shown to elicit similar phenotypes to those seen in the brains of patients with these disorders.Durand CM, Perroy J, Loll F, Perrais D, Fagni L, Bourgeron T, Montcouquiol M, and Sans N. 2011.

First scientifically collected in the early 1800s in Ecuador, it is found in neighboring parts of Peru as well. Its iridescent stem scales help to differentiate it from other related ferns. Description The leaves range from 30 to 50 cm in length, and vary from generally linear to egg-shaped, coming to a point at the tip. The leaf blade is cut into pinnae; the lower and basal pinnae are sometimes cut again into pinnules in the specimens wider at the base. The stalk of the leaf, below the blade (the stipe) may have a few short soft hairs and/or scales on the upper side, or be completely hairless. The stem passing through the leaf blade (the rachis) always has such hairs and/or scales on the upper side, but these do not usually extend to the rest of the rachis. When they occur, the hairs often branch into a star-like shape. The stem scales are iridescent, a distinctive feature of the species. The pinnae, which are alternate on the rachis, range in shape from oblong-falcate (somewhat sickle-shaped) to long-triangular. They are asymmetrical at the base, being attached directly (without petioles) to the rachis near one corner of the pinna. The upper surfaces of the pinnae are hairless; the false indusia occur along one edge. They are folded over the upper side of the leaf and are not divided. Taxonomy Adiantum alarconianum was originally described as A. incisum by Carl Presl in publishing the collection of Thadd√§us Haenke in 1825. However, the name A. incisum had already been used in 1775 to describe a fern collected by Peter Forssk√•l. Presl's ferns were later held to be synonymous with A. alarconianum, the type specimen for which was collected in 1836 and published in 1846 by Charles Gaudichaud. Distribution and habitat Adiantum incisum Presl was described as occurring in Guayas Province, near Guayaquil, and in Mexico, but the latter reference is now held to be an error. The type specimen of A. alarconianum was also collected near Guayaquil. It has been collected in a number of locations in western Ecuador and in the Gal√°pagos Islands, and in the nearby Tumbes Province of Peru. Peruvian specimens were collected in woods.

Modern map surveying in Thailand began in 1875 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) with the establishment of a Mapping Division under the direction of British expatriate Henry Alabaster to lay out the map for telegraphic activities linking Bangkok to Phra Tabong (Battambang) and also to map around the Thai Gulf.Svasti, Pichaya \\"Mapping Siam's History\\" Bangkok Post 26 Sep 2013 Prince Damrong (then known as Phra Ong Chao Ditsawarakuman) conceived the idea of forming a Survey Department. King Rama V granted the establishment of the Thai Survey School in 1882, with initial recruits coming from the Royal Guards. A royal decree issued September 3, 1885, separated the surveyors from the royal bodyguard and created the Royal Survey Department. The department then engaged in cadastral survey, which is the survey of specific land parcels to define ownership for land registration, and for equitable taxation. Land title deeds are issued using the Torrens title system, though it was not until the year 1901 that the first‚Äìfruits of this survey were obtained.

This is an example of flange-bearing frogs in use on North American freight rail lines. A flange- bearing frog, often abbreviated FBF, is a type of frog in which the flange of the wheel on a railway vehicle supports the weight of the vehicle. In conventional practice, the tread of the wheel rests on the head of the rail and bears the weight of the vehicle, while the flange is used to keep the vehicle in the gauge of the track. Modern flange-bearing frogs for use in freight railroad applications are a relatively recent development as a means to reduce maintenance costs associated with turnouts and diamonds, where rails must cross one another. Design Flange-bearing frog (bottom, center) used in street railway trackage in Liberec, Czech Republic. Note the polishing in the flangeway indicating contact with the wheel flange. Flange-bearing frogs have been used by street railways for more than 200 years as a means of reducing noise pollution in populated urban settings.Barkan, Dr. Christopher. CEE 408 - Railway Transportation Engineering, Class Notes. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2011. Print. In 1995, Robert Willow filed a patent in the United States adapting this concept for use in mainline freight and passenger service. The patent describes the technology as, \\"designed to support a railroad wheel to roll through the frog on its flange rather than requiring its tread to jump across a flangeway gap.\\" Ramps are placed on either side of the frog to gradually transition the wheel load from the tread (known as tread-bearing loading mode) to the flange (known as flange-bearing loading mode) and to lift the wheel so that the tread is completely clear of the rail.Willow, R. (1996). U.S. Patent No. 5,531,409. Washington, DC: U.S. Advantages over conventional frogs Conventional frogs require a gap of around in the running surface of the rail to allow adequate clearance for the flange of a railroad wheel. When a wheel in tread-bearing mode encounters this gap at high speed, it generates high dynamic loading (particularly impact loading) on the edge of the rail at the gap.Judge, Tom. \\"A flange-bearing frog concept for heavy rail freight operations - rail crossings track - Vehicle Track Systems Newsletter\\" Railway Age. June 1995. Print, web. The repeated application of this impact leads to significant metal fatigue and eventual failure of the frog components, which translate directly to increased maintenance costs, train delays to allow for repairs, and an overall reduced lifespan for the frog and the track structure.Armstrong, M. (2010, May 14). Overview of Flange-Bearing Frogs. Presentation given at semiweekly William W. Hay Railroad Engineering Seminar, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL. Because the flange rides on a continuous surface in a fully flange-bearing mode, the impact loads generated by the flangeway gap of conventional frogs are eliminated. This reduces maintenance and extends the life of the frog, which leads to an operational cost savings that exceeds the increase in initial costs, when compared to conventional frogs. As previously mentioned, flange- bearing frogs are quieter than conventional frogs‚Äîagain, because of the reduced impact loads‚Äîwhich provides a potential benefit when implemented near residential areas. Types of flange-bearing applications Several types of flange-bearing frogs have been developed for specific applications on North American railroads. These frogs may be flange-bearing in one or both legs of the frog, and may by used either as part of a turnout or as part of a diamond. Lift or jump frog Lift frogs are used in turnouts where the through (straight) route is heavily used, and the diverging (curved) route is only used on occasion and at low speed. The frog is tread-bearing, with a normal rail surface, on the through route, and is flange-bearing on the diverging route. The name is derived from the wheel on the diverging rail being lifted over the through rail. No guard rail is required on the through route, but is critical on the diverging route to keep rail vehicles in gauge. Common applications are set-out tracks or lightly used industry tracks (both of which are special types of sidings diverging from high-speed, high-tonnage mainlines.) Combination tread- and flange-bearing frog Combination tread- and flange-bearing frogs are used in turnouts and are designed to account for various stages of wheel wear (in which the tread of the wheel will wear thin, effectively increasing the flange height): *When the frog is new, all wheels will cross the frog in a fully flange-bearing mode, with no contact between tread and frog. *As the frog is used, the flangeway will abrade against the wheel flanges and deepen. In this case, new wheels (those with shorter flanges) will make contact between tread and frog, creating a combination tread- and flange-bearing loading on the frog. Meanwhile, worn wheels (those with taller flanges) will continue to impart a fully flange- bearing loading onto the frog. *As the frog continues to be used, the flangeway will deepen further until new wheels will cross the frog in a fully tread-bearing mode, while worn wheels will cross the frog in a combination tread- and flange-bearing mode. It is worth noting that as the tread-bearing loading environments begin to manifest themselves, the same impact loads which cause trouble with conventional frogs will return. They are almost exclusively found in rail yards, where rail vehicles operate at or below , due to the reduction of guidance keeping the vehicles in the gauge through the turnout. One-way low-speed diamonds One-way low-speed diamond frogs are used in diamond crossings, often referred to as OWLS diamonds. These types of frogs are analogous to lift frogs in turnouts: the higher-trafficked line crosses the diamond on a normal rail surface in tread-bearing mode, and the lower- trafficked line crosses over the higher-trafficked line in flange-bearing mode. Because there is no flangeway gap to cross on the higher-trafficked line, vehicles using this line can cross the diamonds at the maximum speed allowed by the track design. Because the lower-trafficked line is in a situation where gauge restraint is reduced and because it has to cross over the flangeway gap for the higher-trafficked line, vehicles using this line are limited to speeds at or below . OWLS diamonds are commonly used where a rail line with very little traffic operating at low speed crosses a rail line with considerably more traffic operating at higher speeds.Clark, D., O'Connor, T., and Davis, D. (2008). Update on the Use of Flange-Bearing Technology in Special Trackwork. Annual Conference of American Railway Engineers and Maintenance-of-Way Association. Retrieved November 17, 2011, from http://www.arema.org/files/library/2008_Conference_Proceedings/Update_on_the_Use_of_Flange_Bearing_Technology_in_Special_Trackwork_2008.pdf Full flange-bearing diamonds Full flange-bearing diamond frogs are also used in diamond crossings. These frogs are flange-bearing for both lines through the diamond. Because both lines are flange-bearing, there is no need to elevate the flanges of vehicles using one line, as there is in the case of OWLS diamond frogs, which allows for greater gauge restraint. Consequently, vehicles can cross these frogs at the maximum speed allowed by the track design; regardless of which line on which they cross the diamond. Though there are very few of these in use today, full flange-bearing diamonds can be found where two high-speed or high-tonnage main lines must cross one another at- grade. Regulatory landscape In an effort to regulate the depth of flangeways in a crossing frog, the US Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) created rules which, by definition, prohibited the use of flange-bearing frogs on track with speed limits greater than .Track Safety Standards Compliance Manual. Federal Railroad Administration, 2009. Print, Web. Track Safety Standards Compliance Manual Because of this, an FRA waiver is required to install full flange-bearing diamonds. Subsequent to installation, an extensive battery of inspections of both the diamond itself, and rail vehicles which cross the diamond, to ensure that safety is not compromised by the installation of such a diamond.Cerny, Louis. \\"New Federal Railroad Administration waiver allows unlimited number of flange-bearing frog crossing diamonds to be installed.\\" Railway Track and Structures. January 12, 2011. Print, web. This may change in the future, as FBF becomes a proven technology, but currently the rigorous inspections are a deterrent for widespread installation of full flange-bearing diamonds. Implementation * BNSF Railway had installed more than 100 lift frogs across their system, with plans to install many more. *In September 2009, BNSF installed three combination tread- and flange-bearing frogs in their Lafayette, Louisiana yard. Since installation, the frogs have worn as described above, and there is evidence that some wheels already cross the frog in a combination tread- and flange- bearing mode. * BNSF had installed 22 OWLS diamonds on its system; CSX had installed 13. *In 2006, CSX installed a full flange-bearing diamond at Shelby, Ohio, the first application of this technology on a North American freight railroad. In 2008, BNSF Railway installed two such diamonds at Moorhead, Minnesota. Both installations are under FRA-mandated inspection, as described above. Results Though tests are still ongoing, results in both controlled environments and revenue service are promising. The Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado, has installed an OWLS diamond on their property, where they perform research for various railroad entities. Their results show that dynamic loads from a train crossing an OWLS diamond are half the loads from the same train crossing a conventional diamond at half the speed it crossed the OWLS diamond.Davis, D. (2009). Low-Impact Special Trackwork Research at Transportation Technology Center, Inc.. Presentation given at the annual conference of the Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC. The inspections of both track and vehicles by BNSF and CSX at their full flange- bearing diamonds have shown no unexpected wear, and suggest that such diamonds could be implemented on a larger scale.

Life and career Maria Koleva was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and studied chemical engineering in the United States and Germany before emigrating to France in 1971. There she studied cinema in Vincennes and began work as a film-maker. Her 1982 four-hour film-book L'√©tat de bonheur... permanent won the Grand Prize at the Belfort Festival and is recognized as representative of the political-shown-through-the-personal film-making style of the period. Her 1974 film La f√™te aujourd'hui, la f√™te demain featured the English rock band The Who performing in Paris in 1972. She also made five films on Antoine Vitez featuring the French director conducting workshop sessions. In 1989 Koleva conducted a 45-day hunger strike to bring attention to the fact that independent film-makers were unable to obtain distribution on French TV.

He was the ancestor of many of the Joyce families of County Kerry, County Limerick, and County Cork, including that of the author James Joyce, Patrick Weston Joyce and Robert Dwyer Joyce. Biography Seoighe came from Connemara in County Galway, and relocated to County Kerry by about 1680 to work for William FitzMaurice, 20th Baron Kerry. His move may have been facilitated by the O'Malley family of Mayo, who had connections with the FitzMaurice family. An alternative tradition of the Joyces near Fermoy indicates that Seoighe came from the Kylemore-Ballynakill area near Letterfrack, and moved to Kerry along with his brother. Seoighe became household steward for William FitzMaurice, who lived at Lixnaw, on the Brick river, south-west of Listowel. He appears to have been hired by FitzMaurice on the basis of being a stonemason and builder. Seoige oversaw the transformation of Lixnaw Old Court and its associated buildings, and was given land to settle in the area.

Description Compass consists of mirror-polished stainless steel tubes and four different blocks of Wisconsin granite. The sculpture measures 12'h. x 10'w. x 3'd. and was installed and signed by Hudson in 2005. This abstract/geometric sculpture connects four Wisconsin granite blocks with stainless steel tubes to form the shape of a circle or \\"compass\\" (one block at north, east, south, and west points). The sculpture includes Wausau Ruby Red, Glacial Rose, Amberg Silver Grey and Mellen Black Gabbro granite. The sculpture sits along the bike-path at the edge of the cliff above Brady St. Bridge, overlooking Lincoln Boulevard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Historical information Location history Compass was commissioned through a national competition of the County of Milwaukee for the new Pedestrian Brady Street Bridge. It is one part of the commission; Hudson also created Sentinels nestled within the circle of the ramp descending from the bridge. A poem written by Hudson's mother, poet Jean Barlow Hudson is engraved at the base of the sculpture. Hudson claims the poem was a premonition for this sculpture, although it was written \\"in the 40s before I was born.\\" The poem reads as follows: \\"Inner time is limitless ‚Äì from past lives I can no longer remember, only feel. Time flows, and around me a continuum moves and swirls, engulfing me, and moves majestically beyond my inner sight or imagination. This time is immense, a celestial sphere yet it does not forget me, does not neglect me. It embraces me. I am part of its verity. It is a part of mine. My life flows. It flows.\\" Compass is also based on a local Lakota Sioux Native-American story of discovering the four points of a compass. In the story, a bird leads the narrator to four boulders, symbolizing different directions. Hudson includes a depiction of this bird in his northern stone; he uses the copper cutout bird from the Mound City Hopewell Indians of Ohio as a guide. The stainless steel tubes were polished to a mirror-like quality for multiple different reasons: \\"to incorporate the color and atmosphere of the environment into the work, reflect the movement of passers-by, and to make the stones float, like my Father did with my Mother in their floating ring trick back in the 40s in Wyoming when he was a professional magician named Bendu.\\" In addition to these references, Hudson also incorporates the Chinese jade disc \\"bi\\" or \\"pi\\" ‚Äì the symbol for unity, peace, wholeness and heaven. Acquisition The Milwaukee Percent for Art Program commissioned both Sentinels and Compass for the Brady Street Pedestrian Bridge. The sculpture was administered by the Milwaukee County Department of Parks, Recreation, and Culture through a national competition in 2005. Artist Jon Barlow Hudson was born in Montana in 1945 and has spent much of his life traveling the United States as well as overseas. His father was a hydro-geologist, writer, professional magician, builder, and a violinist. Hudson's mother was a weaver, writer, teacher, and public activist (she would become Yellow Springs, Ohio's first female mayor in later years). When Jon was six years old, their family traveled to Saudi Arabia, and through the foreign traveling, Hudson was able to explore many great historical-sculptural sites. He worked at several apprenticeships and gained knowledge from life experience, but also attained his Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees from the California Institute of the Arts. Hudson prefers to work with stone, steel (painted or raw/polished), glass, light, water, and other natural materials. Jon Barlow creates large and small scale public and private sculptures, installations, and corporate sculptures. Hudson has displayed sculptures in over 23 different countries and enjoys working with the space to either reflect or transform the surroundings, according to the criteria for each site-specific sculpture.

Doug Dagger (born Douglas Scott Kane, October 17, 1967, New York City, United States) is an American vocalist. He is the lead singer for the Los Angeles punk rock band The Generators, which formed in 1997, and was lead singer for Schleprock and other punk bands. Life and early career Kane was born into an entertainment family; his mother was a nightclub showgirl and his father was an entertainment manager. Kane is also the grandson of 1930s Vaudeville musician Buster Shaver. Kane Moved to South Pasadena, California in 1978, and by 1981 he was involved in the early Los Angeles punk scene. By 1983, at the age of 15, Kane was singing in his first punk band, Doug & The Slugz. By 1984, the band changed their name to The Risk. By the mid 1980s, Kane‚Äôs music career took a back seat to drug abuse and numerous jail cell visits. At the age of 17, he had become a founding member of a notorious Los Angeles punk/skinhead gang. Kane eventually became homeless and joined a violent San Gabriel Valley Mexican gang. In 1986, Kane had started dealing drugs at the East Los Angeles Housing Project. During his teens and early twenties, Kane had numerous jobs such as a warehouse worker, dishwasher, carpenter and grave digger. Professional career In the summer of 1988, Kane started sing for the Alhambra, California-based punk band Schleprock. By 1990, the band released their first EP, ‚ÄúDo It All‚Äù on Nemesis Records, alongside labelmates The Offspring. Over the next decade, Kane and Schleprock released six more EPs: Looking Back (1992), Gotta Get Out (1993), Spring (1993), Migraine (1994), Something Like That (1994) and Out Of Spite (1995). They also released two full-length albums: Hide & Seek (1993) and Propeller (1994). They signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1996, and released their last full-length album Americas Dirty Little Secret Over a stretch of eight years, the band support such bands as Green Day, NOFX, Blink 182, Primus, Bad Religion, The Specials and Face to Face. Schleprock disbanded in February 1997, and within six months, Kane formed his new band The Generators. In 1998, the band released its first full-length album, Welcome To The End, on Triple X Records. The Generators have since released 7 more full-length albums: Burning Ambition (2000), Tyranny (2001), Excess, Betrayal and Our Dearly Departed (2003), Winter Of Discontent (2005), Great Divide (2007), Between The Devil & The Deep Blue Sea (2009) and Last Of The Pariahs (2011) (along with many other splits and EPs). The Generators have developed a rich popularity in Europe and recently signed with Randale Records for the release of their 9th studio album. The Generators have also contributed music for the Los Angeles Lakers, California Angels, Corono and The Grammy Awards foundation. Kane still resides in Los Angeles, and owns and operates a clothing/uniform business in between touring and making records.

Due to the ever existing power imbalance between mechanical power supply and electric power demand the rotational frequency of the rotating masses in all synchronous generators in the grid either speed up (excess power supply) or slow down (excess power demand). This enables the grid operator to rebalance the system in order to stop the speed change, resulting in a relatively small variation in AC frequency ideally within the allowable frequency range of that system. i.e. A 50 Hz system may allow a ¬±0.5 Hz deviation in the frequency of the AC voltage The grid frequency is the combined result of the detailed motions of all individual synchronous rotors in the grid, which are modeled by a general equation of motion called the Swing Equation.  Simulating power balancing with wind power  When the grid frequency is too high or too low, active power flow through the high-voltage direct current link will be ramped down or up.

Overview The album presents a fusion of jazz with rock, African, Indian, and Arabic music. Reception The Allmusic review by Steve Huey awarded the album 4¬Ω stars stating \\"Brown Rice is the most accessible entry point into Cherry's borderless ideal, jelling into a personal, unique, and seamless vision that's at once primitive and futuristic in the best possible senses of both words. While Cherry would record a great deal of fine work in the years to come, he would never quite reach this level of wild invention again\\". Brian Morton and Richard Cook, writing for The Penguin Guide to Jazz, called Brown Rice \\"a lost classic of the era and probably the best place to sample the trumpeter as both soloist ‚Äì he blows some stunningly beautiful solos here ‚Äì and as the shamanic creator of a unique, unearthly sound that makes dull nonsense of most fusion work of the period.‚Ä¶ Exceptional and recommended.\\" Previous editions of The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a four-star rating, of a possible four. Carl Braurer, writing for Cadence, suggested that the title track and \\"Degi-Degi\\" were the least successful tracks on the album, and would have benefited from shorter running times. However, Braurer felt that overall, \\"this [album] is Cherry at his finest.\\" The All Music Guide to Jazz, which reprinted Braurer's review, marked the album as a landmark recording.

It is a benthopelagic, subtropical, marine fish that can reach up to in length. In the countries near the Mediterranean and Black Seas, it makes up a significant portion of fish catch, 54% of fish caught in the latter. Despite overfishing in the 1980s, catch numbers have leveled out and it is listed as least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Mediterranean horse mackerel was first described in 1868 by Austrian ichthyologist, zoologist, and herpetologist Franz Steindachner, who gave it the name Caranx trachurus mediterraneus. It was also described two other times, by Y. G. Aleev in 1956 and J. Dardignac and A. Vincent. Its generic name comes from the Greek roots trachys meaning \\"rough\\" and oura meaning \\"tail\\". Description The Mediterranean horse mackerel has an elongated, compressed body (up to in length, common length ) with a large head and projected lower jaw. The nostrils are small and close- set and the eyes are protected by a well-developed adipose eyelid. Its upper jaw, or maxilla, is also large and wide. Its body is a dusky color, blue to grey to black in color dorsally and on top of the head, while the lower two- thirds of the body is white to silver in color. Its caudal fin is yellow and it has a distinct black mark just posterior to the operculum. It has 36-41 gillrakers and the anal fin is preceded by two separate spines. Distribution and habitat Map of the Black Sea region The Mediterranean horse mackerel is found in subtropical waters throughout the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Biscay to Mauritania, as well as the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the southwestern Sea of Azov. Its latitudinal range extends from 49¬∞N to 28¬∞N and its longitudinal range extends from 13¬∞W to 43¬∞E. The subspecies T. m. mediterraneus is found in the Mediterranean Sea, while the T. m. ponticus subspecies, also called the Black Sea scad, is native to the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the Sea of Azov. T. m. ponticus is found in the territorial waters of every country bordering the Black Sea: Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Subspecies populations are not isolated and some limited migration between seas occurs. Hybrid offspring have been found in the wild. Its typical depth range is , though it can be found as deep as . It lives near the ocean floor, though it sometimes schools near the surface. Biology and ecology A marine species that prefers brackish water and subtropical temperatures, the Mediterranean horse mackerel is oceandromous, that is it migrates within its native bodies of water. It feeds primarily on sardines, anchovies, and small crustaceans. It shoals with other members of its genus, such as T. trachurus and T. picturatus. Like other mackerels, the Mediterranean horse mackerel's reproduction is oviparous. Its reproductive cycle is divided into three distinct stages, the prereproductive, reproductive, and postreproductive. The prereproductive stages occurs from January to April and the postreproductive stage occurs from September to December. During these periods, the gonads are much smaller than the reproductive stage. Mating occurs in the summer from May to August, during which testes and ovaries grow significantly in size. The ovaries become a dark orange color and eggs are visible on the surface. Embryonic development occurs in 24‚Äì26 hours. Eggs are pelagic and in length. Sexual maturity is reached at 2 years of age and around in length for both males and females. It is parasitized by the monogeneans Gastrocotyle trachuri, Pseudaxine trachuri, and Cemocotyle trachuri. Human interaction Commercial capture of Mediterranean horse mackerel in tonnes from 1950 to 2009 Mediterranean horse mackerel are an important economic resource in the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean horse mackerel is an important resource in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea region. It makes up 54% of catches in the Black Sea and 39% in the Sea of Marmara. In the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, it only totals 3-4% of annual catches. Fixed nets and seines are common methods used to catch Mediterranean horse mackerel. Along with T. trachurus, it is one of two Trachurus species in the Mediterranean. Because it forms dense schools and lives in shallower waters, the Mediterranean horse mackerel is the more commonly caught species. Along with Engraulis encrasicolus, it makes up 59% of seafood production in Turkey. Despite being regularly caught in mixed-species fisheries, the Mediterranean horse mackerel is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its wide range buffers it from steep population declines, and none has been observed in recent years, with catches leveling out in the past decade. Overfishing in the 1980s led to a steep decline in catches in the Black and Marmara Seas, but has since become stable. Some conservation measures are in place in certain European countries. Minimum catch lengths are in the EU, in Ukraine, in Romania and Bulgaria, and in Turkey.

Overview Unlike the Krazy Kat films of the Winkler and Columbia period, animator Isidore Klein attempted to create Lil' Ainjil in the milieu of George Herriman's comic strips. However, the film was not well received by critics, prompting the series to revert to their current setting.Maltin 210‚Äì11. Plot Offissa Pupp and Mrs. Kwakk Wakk are walking down the road, talking about one's own livelihood. On the way, they find Krazy sticking his head inside a small theater box. On the other side of the box, Ignatz the mouse is tossing bricks at Krazy's head but the cat appears to be enjoying it. The suspicious Offissa Pupp goes around and eventually notices the reality before arresting Ignatz. Offissa Pupp imprisons Ignatz and walks away in celebration. Despite Ignatz's malicious treatment, Krazy feels sorry and decides to break the rodent out of the slammer. The na√Øve cat offers Ignatz a pie which conceals carpentry tools. Ignatz uses the tools to demolish the prison to the ground. But in doing so, another criminal is released. That other criminal runs into the open and begins harassing the Mrs. Kwakk Wakk. Offissa Pupp struggles to intervene. For some reason,Ignatz decides to help out the Offissa Pupp by taking a machine gun and firing it at the criminal. The criminal is taken down, and Mrs. Kwakk Wakk is safe. Though he escaped prison, Ignatz, nonetheless, receives a handshake from the Offissa Pupp for the assistance. As they go their separate ways, Ignatz sees Krazy joyously dancing around. He finds a square rock and throws it at Krazy, knocking the cat unconscious. Offissa Pupp, who isn't too faraway, saw the deed, and chases Ignatz into the horizon.

They provide housing, legal aid, and protection to couples seeking their aid who are being persecuted by family and society for wanting to marry based solely on mutual attraction and love. Overview In India, most marriages are arranged by parents, with potential marriage partners vetted on the basis of caste, complexion, horoscope, etc.,‚Äîthe matter of love is rarely considered. Falling in love carries a strong social stigma in India. Love across the barriers of caste, religion and economic class can be problematic, resulting in violence and occasionally honor killing. The police have been known to refuse protection to such couples, sometimes even siding with parents and arresting the male lovers on false charges of rape. The Love Commandos consists of journalists, businessmen, lawyers and human rights activists. They provide protection to lovers from religious hardliners. They also run secret shelters for eloped couples, where they may stay until they gain financial independence. They also help willing couples to get married and register their marriage with the civil authorities. The group was originally called the Peace Commandos, who worked to protect lovers from religious extremist groups during occasions like Valentine's Day. Later, they decided to rename the group, and concentrate on protecting lovers and on the issue of honor killing. In 2010, Love Commando was formed after a man was arrested on statutory rape charges. Even though the woman went on record that she was an adult and the relationship was consensual, the police decided to attest the father's statement that she was a minor. Harsh Malhotra, a travel agent, founded the group. He was assaulted himself when he went to his future wife's family and later they had to elope. He is now an interior designer and the chief coordinator of the group. Sanjay Sachdeva is one of the co-founders and now runs the organization as its chairman. The organization completed its 500 days of formation in November 2011. It has more than 20,00000 members across India. It receives an average of 300 calls everyday on its 24-hours helpline 09313784375 and 09313550006 Whatsapp 09311050004. They have 450 plus shelters across India. Their cost of operations in the Delhi unit alone is about per month. Sachdeva was interviewed on the 5th episode of Aamir Khan's television show Satyamev Jayate. After his appearance on the show, the organization began getting more calls than before. However, Hakim Abdul, who appeared in the same episode with his wife, was murdered five months later in November 2012 in Bulandshahr village in western Uttar Pradesh. The Love Commandos continued to protect his widow and infant daughter. In April 2014, Bj√∂rn Borg launched the website Unitethelovers.com to collect funds for the organisation. In the same year, photographer Max Pinckers featured Love Commandos and eloped couples in his photobook, Will They Sing Like Raindrops or Leave Me Thirsty. The book won the Photographic Museum of Humanity grant. In 2014, a girl, whose father was a liquor baron in Agra, eloped with a man and sought shelter with the Love Commandos in nearby New Delhi. The girl's father used his influence to ask Agra police to search for the girl. Agra police allegedly managed to find the girl's location in a suburban area in New Delhi by using her cellphone signal. They began combing area while being armed. Delhi police had to intervene and stop the search.

Special Screening of Miriam Lyons directed film 'The Love Commandos' was held at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, Hyderabad on March 24, 2017 for Indian Police Service probationers, which is a landmark for the Non Profit Organisation.

These include the causes of debt increases, the impact of tax cuts, specific events such as the United States fiscal cliff, the effectiveness of stimulus, and the impact of the Great Recession, among others. The article explains how to analyze the U.S. budget as well as the competing economic schools of thought that support the budgetary positions of the major parties. Overview CBO: U.S. Federal spending and revenue components for fiscal year 2019. Major expenditure categories are healthcare, Social Security, and defense; income and payroll taxes are the primary revenue sources. Many of the debates about the United States federal budget center on competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of both private and public enterprise, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future generations, who may also have to bear additional interest and taxation burdens.Peter G. Peterson Foundation ‚Äì Citizen's Guide 2010 Political realities make major budgetary deals difficult to achieve. While Republicans argue conceptually for tax cuts for the wealthy and reductions in Medicare and Social Security, they are hesitant to actually vote to reduce the benefits from these popular programs. Democrats on the other hand argue conceptually for tax increases on the wealthy and a stronger social safety net. The so-called budgetary \\"grand bargain\\" of tax hikes on the rich and removal of some popular tax deductions in exchange for reductions to Medicare and Social Security spending is therefore elusive. Debates following the 2008‚Äì2009 recession and resulting slow economic growth and high unemployment centered on the prioritization of job creation and economic stimulus versus the need to address significant budget deficits.Paul Krugman. The Hijacked Crisis. NYT. August 11, 2011President Obama ‚Äì Weekly Address. November 10, 2012 Concerns regarding the economic impact of significant deficit reductions forecast for 2013 (dubbed the \\"fiscal cliff\\") were addressed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which included: a) the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for only the top 1% of income earners; b) the end of the Obama payroll tax cuts; and c) a sequester (cap) on spending for the military and other discretionary categories of spending. The deficit faded as a major issue for the remainder of President Obama's tenure, as the deficit returned to its historical average relative to GDP by 2014 as the economy recovered. President Donald Trump has proposed policies including significant tax cuts and increased spending on defense and infrastructure. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Moody's Analytics reported in 2016 that enacting these policies would dramatically increase the annual budget deficits and national debt over the 2017‚Äì2026 periods, relative to the current policy baseline, which already includes a sizable debt increase.Fiscal Fact Check: How Do Donald Trump's Campaign Proposals So Far Add Up?, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (February 13, 2016). Analyzing the budget Measured as % GDP, both revenue and outlays (spending) significantly diverged from their historical average due to the Great Recession, then returned to those averages by 2014 as the economy recovered. Table compares US federal spending and revenue in 2017 vs. 2016 using CBO historical data.CBO Historical Data June 2017 Before analyzing the budget debates, some background on the key terms used and sources of information may be helpful. The definitive analysis of the federal budget is performed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which is the non-partisan organization charged with evaluating the budgetary and economic impact of legislation for the U.S. Congress. The CBO provides reports on specific legislation, as well as overall analyses of the budget and economy. For example, the annual \\"CBO Budget and Economic Outlook\\" covers recent historical information as well as revenue, expense, deficit, and debt projections for a ten-year forecast period. It also includes economic projections, as budgetary results are related to economic results. The CBO provides a \\"current law baseline\\" which assumes current laws are executed as written (e.g., tax cuts expire at the date legislated), as well as \\"current policy baselines\\" which assume current policies continue indefinitely. It also provides historical information in supplemental tables. Since the federal budget and economic variables are so large (trillions of dollars), CBO also measures many key variables relative to the GDP, a measure of the size of the economy. CBO uses an array of graphics to help explain their analyses, several examples of which are included in this article. CBO evaluates each fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 to September 30. For example, the CBO and Treasury Departments reported that: * Federal spending increased significantly from $3.0 trillion in FY2008 to $3.5 trillion in FY2009, the last fiscal year budgeted by President Bush, which overlapped with President Obama's first year in office. This increase was primarily due to the Great Recession, which significantly increased automatic stabilizer spending (e.g., unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) which are made to eligible parties, without any legislative action.CBO ‚Äì The Effects of Automatic Stabilizers on the Federal Budget as of 2013. Retrieved October 12, 2016 Spending then roughly stabilized at that dollar level for the remainder of his two terms. During 2015, the U.S. federal government spent $3.7 trillion, around the historical average relative to the size of the economy at 20.7% GDP. Projecting 2008 federal spending forward at the historical 5% rate, by 2015 it was $500 billion below trend. * Revenue fell from $2.5 trillion in FY 2008 to $2.1 trillion in 2009, roughly $400 billion or 20%, as economic activity slowed due to the Great Recession. Measured as a % GDP, revenue in 2009 was the lowest in 50 years at 14.6% GDP. Revenue then began to recover as the economy did, returning to the historical average of 17.4% GDP by 2014. * The budget deficit reached 10.8% GDP in 2009 in the depths of the recession, before steadily recovering to 2.5% GDP by 2015, below the historical average (1970‚Äì2015) of 2.8% GDP. * The national debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. Roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6‚Äì8 trillion adjusting for the extension of the Bush tax cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the Bush tax cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1‚Äì2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like the Social Security Trust Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP by 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era, mainly due to the economic impact of the Great Recession and the extension of the Bush tax cuts. The CBO also provides a long term forecast (30 years) as part of their \\"CBO Long-Term Budget Outlook\\" annual report. Over the longer-term, the U.S. faces budgetary challenges primarily related to an aging population, along with healthcare costs growing faster than inflation, which are increasing the spending relative to GDP for mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Under current law, future deficits driven primarily by these programs are expected to drive larger amounts of debt and interest payments, particularly as interest rates return to more normal levels from the unusually low levels during the aftermath of the Great Recession. For example, Social Security spending relative to GDP is expected to rise from 4.9% GDP in 2016 to 6.2% GDP by over the 2027‚Äì2036 period; for Medicare, these figures are 3.8% GDP and 5.5% GDP, respectively. Without changes that increase revenues or reduce the rate of spending increases relative to GDP or both, U.S. debt held by the public will rise beyond the 100% GDP level by 2030, a level last seen in the aftermath of World War 2. Cause of increases in deficits and debt 2001‚Äì2011 Cause of change between CBO's 2001 projection of a $5.6 trillion surplus between 2002‚Äì2012 and the $6.1 trillion debt increase that actually occurred. CBO cause of change analysis Both economic conditions and policy decisions significantly worsened the debt outlook since 2001, when large budget surpluses were forecast for the following decade by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In June 2012, CBO summarized the cause of change between its January 2001 estimate of a $5.6 trillion cumulative surplus between 2002 and 2011 and the actual $6.1 trillion cumulative deficit that occurred, an unfavorable \\"turnaround\\" or debt increase of $11.7 trillion. Tax cuts and slower-than-expected growth reduced revenues by $6.1 trillion and spending was $5.6 trillion higher. Of this total, the CBO attributes 72% to legislated tax cuts and spending increases and 27% to economic and technical factors. Of the latter, 56% occurred from 2009 to 2011.Bruce Barlett. The Fiscal Legacy of George W. Bush. June 12, 2012. NYTCBO ‚Äì Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since 2001 According to CBO, the difference between the projected and actual debt in 2011 can be largely attributed to: * $3.5 trillion ‚Äì Economic changes (including lower than expected tax revenues and higher safety net spending due to recession) * $1.6 trillion ‚Äì Bush Tax Cuts (EGTRRA and JGTRRA), primarily tax cuts but also some smaller spending increases * $1.5 trillion ‚Äì Increased defense and non-defense discretionary spending * $1.4 trillion ‚Äì Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq * $1.4 trillion ‚Äì Incremental interest due to higher debt balances * $0.9 trillion ‚Äì Obama stimulus and tax cuts (ARRA and Tax Act of 2010) Similar analyses were reported by the Pew Center in November 2011Pew Center ‚Äì 10 Essential Fiscal Charts .

May 2011 Economist Paul Krugman wrote in May 2011: \\"What happened to the budget surplus the federal government had in 2000? The answer is, three main things. First, there were the Bush tax cuts, which added roughly $2 trillion to the national debt over the last decade. Second, there were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which added an additional $1.1 trillion or so. And third was the Great Recession, which led both to a collapse in revenue and to a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net programs.\\"Krugman, Paul. The Unwisdom of Elites. The New York Times. May 9, 2011. A Bloomberg analysis in May 2011 attributed $2.0 trillion of the $9.3 trillion of public debt (20%) to additional military and intelligence spending since September 2001, plus another $45 billion annually in interest.Bloomberg. Bin Laden Exacts Multitrillion-Dollar Toll on U.S. Taxpayer. May 12, 2011 What deficit trajectory did President Obama \\"inherit\\"? Comparison of CBO 2009 deficit forecasts versus actual results 2009‚Äì2016. The Republicans were quick to blame President Obama for the large debt increases during his tenure. But was he really to blame? The Great Recession had caused federal government revenues to fall to their lowest level relative to the size of the economy in 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) from 2008 to 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures (including automatic stabilizers such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (which took effect without legislative action; benefits are paid to eligible recipients) ranged between $350‚Äì420 billion annually from 2009‚Äì2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the Republican Congress, which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration. One incident illustrates the nature and tensions of the debate. The U.S. added $1.0 trillion to the national debt in fiscal year (FY) 2008, which ended September 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected two weeks prior to Obama taking office in January 2009 that the deficit in FY2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of the Bush tax cuts as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if the Bush tax cuts were extended at all income levels. Adjusting other assumptions in the CBO baseline could have raised that debt level even higher. In response to Republican criticism, President Obama claimed that \\"The fact of the matter is that when we came into office, the deficit was $1.3 trillion [for FY 2009]...[with] $8 trillion worth of debt [projected] over the next decade,\\" a claim which Politifact rated as \\"Mostly True.\\" President Obama had pledged not to raise taxes except on high income taxpayers, so his debt figure included the extension of the Bush tax cuts for most taxpayers. These facts did not stop Republicans from blaming the President for the ensuing debts during his administration. One study summarized in the New York Times estimated that President Bush's policies added $5.07 trillion to the debt between 2002‚Äì2009, while President Obama's policies would add an estimated $1.44 trillion to the debt between 2009‚Äì2017.How the Deficit Got this Big.

The impact of these changes was referred to as the \\"fiscal cliff.\\"Recession Possible if Impasse Persists, Budget Office Says. NYT, May 23, 2012 The CBO estimated in May 2012 that without legislative changes this would: * Reduce the projected 2013 deficit from $1,037 billion to $641 billion, a 38% reduction; * Reduce real GDP growth in 2013 from 1.7% to -0.5%, with a high probability of recession during the first half of the year, followed by 2.3% growth in the second half; * Increase the unemployment rate from 8.0% to 9.1%; and * Support relatively higher growth over the long-run, due to lower deficits and debt.CBO ‚Äì Economic Effects of Reducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Occur in 2013‚ÄìMay 2012Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ‚Äì Misguided Fiscal Cliff Fears Pose Challenges to Productive Budget Negotiations. June 4, 2012 The CBO estimated that letting existing laws take effect beyond 2012 would significantly reduce future budget deficits. For example, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 (initially extended by Obama from 2010 to 2012) were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. Other deficit reducers per the CBO included: allowing the automatic spending cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to take effect, allowing payroll tax cuts in 2011 and 2012 to expire, allowing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to affect more taxpayers, and reducing Medicare reimbursements to doctors. These and other current laws, if allowed to take effect, were expected to reduce the projected 2021 deficit from an estimated 4.7% GDP to 1.2% GDP.CBO ‚Äì Long Term Budget Outlook Graphics. August 2012] Total deficit reduction could be as high as $7.1 trillion over a decade if current law was enforced and not overridden by new legislation.Ezra Klein. Double Dip, or Just One Big Economic Dive?. Washington Post. August 5, 2011 The now infamous phrase was coined by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in February 2012, during one of his required appearances before Congress on the state of the U.S. economy. He described ... \\"a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases\\" on Jan. 1, 2013. The fiscal cliff was mostly avoided by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which included: a) the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for only the top 1% of income earners; b) the end of the Obama payroll tax cuts; and c) a sequester (cap) on spending for the military and other discretionary categories of spending. Compared against a baseline where the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire for all levels of income, it significantly increased future deficits. Compared against the prior year, it significantly reduced the deficit and avoided some future cost increases. Budgetary impact of the Affordable Care Act (\\"Obamacare\\") CBO estimated in June 2015 that repeal of ACA would increase the deficit between $137 and $353 billion over the 2016‚Äì2025 period, depending on the impact of macroeconomic feedback effects. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was evaluated multiple times by the Congressional Budget Office, which scored it as a moderate deficit reducer, as it included tax hikes primarily on high income taxpayers (over $200,000, roughly the top 5% of earners) and reductions in future Medicare cost increases, offsetting subsidy costs. The CBO also reported in June 2015 that: \\"Including the budgetary effects of macroeconomic feedback, repealing the ACA would increase federal budget deficits by $137 billion over the 2016‚Äì2025 period.\\" CBO also estimated that excluding the effects of macroeconomic feedback, repeal of the ACA would increase the deficit by $353 billion over that same period. Economic impact on the budget deficit Linkage of economy and budget A booming economy tends to improve the budget deficit, as high levels of activity and employment generate higher tax revenues, while safety net expenditures (e.g., automatic stabilizers such as unemployment, food stamps, and disability) are reduced. Further, since GDP is higher, budgetary measures relative to GDP are lower. On the other hand, a slumping economy (recession) works in the opposite direction, as lower economic activity and higher unemployment reduce tax revenues, and higher automatic stabilizer spending occurs. The effects of the Great Recession were discussed in the background section. So a key to understanding the connection between the economy and the budget is employment. This is one reason why politicians focus on job creation as a primary responsibility. John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1937: \\"The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury.\\" In other words, the government should act to stabilize economic conditions, reducing the budget deficit when the economy is booming (or maintaining a surplus) and increasing the deficit (or reducing the surplus) when the economy is in recession. The only fiscal years since 1970 when the U.S. had a budget surplus were 1998‚Äì2001, a combination of the booming 1990's economy and Clinton's higher tax rates. Economic stimulus (increasing the deficit) is done by lowering taxes or increasing spending, while the opposite is done for economic austerity. Economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson wrote in July 2011: \\"Like many economists, I believe that the immediate crisis facing the United States economy is the jobs deficit, not the budget deficit. The magnitude of the jobs crisis is clearly illustrated by the jobs gap ‚Äì currently around 12.3 million jobs. That is how many jobs the economy must add to return to its peak employment level before the 2008‚Äì9 recession and to absorb the 125,000 people who enter the labor force each month. At the current pace of recovery, the gap will be not closed until 2020 or later.\\" She explained further that job growth between 2000 and 2007 was only half what it had been in the preceding three decades, pointing to several studies by other economists indicating globalization and technology change had highly negative effects on certain sectors of the U.S. workforce and overall wage levels.NYT- Economix-Laura D'Andrea Tyson-Jobs Deficit, Investment Deficit, Budget Deficit. July 29, 2011] Government budget balance as a sectoral component Sectoral financial balances in U.S. economy 1990‚Äì2012. By definition, the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the U.S. capital surplus and private sector surplus have driven a government budget deficit. Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S. economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. In the U.S., a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business investment. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local. For example, the government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S. July 19, 2012 Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, writing: \\"The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.\\" Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: \\"This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-The Problem-December 2011 President Trump's proposals The CBO forecast in April 2018 that under current policy, the sum of annual federal budget deficits (debt increases) would be $13.7 trillion over the 2018-2027 time period. This is $4.3 trillion higher (46%) than the CBO January 2017 baseline of $9.4 trillion. The change is mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. CBO current law baseline as of January 2017, showing forecast of deficit and debt by year. This is the baseline prior to any changes by President Trump. It is the financial position he \\"inherits\\" from President Obama. Prior to his election, President Donald Trump proposed policies including significant income tax cuts and increased spending on defense and infrastructure. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) and Moody's Analytics reported in 2016 that enacting these policies would dramatically increase the annual budget deficits and national debt over the 2017-2026 periods, relative to the current policy baseline, which already includes a sizable debt increase. For example, the CRFB estimated that: * Revenues would fall $5.8 trillion over 10 years relative to the current policy baseline, due to significant income tax cuts. Roughly 50% of federal income taxes are paid by the top 1% highest income taxpayers; those with lower incomes pay payroll taxes. So this type of tax cut primarily benefits the wealthy. * Spending would be reduced by $1.2 trillion over 10 years, offset by $700 billion in additional interest expense, for a net reduction of $0.5 trillion. * The deficit would increase by $5.3 trillion over 10 years. * Debt held by the public would rise to 105% GDP by 2026, versus 86% GDP under the current policy baseline. It was approximately 76% in 2016. The CBO will \\"score\\" any major budgetary legislation proposed by Trump during his tenure. What deficit trajectory did President Trump \\"inherit\\"? In January 2017, the Congressional Budget Office reported its baseline budget projections for the 2017‚Äì2027 time periods, based on laws in place as of the end of the Obama administration. CBO forecasted that the sum of the annual budget deficits (i.e., debt additions) would be $9.4 trillion from 2018-2027. These increases would primarily be driven by an aging population, which impacts the costs of Social Security and Medicare, along with interest on the debt. CBO also estimated that if policies in place as of the end of the Obama administration continued over the following decade, real GDP would grow at approximately 2% per year, the unemployment rate would remain around 5%, inflation would remain around 2%, and interest rates would rise moderately. President Trump's economic policies can also be measured against this baseline. How have President Trump's policies impacted the federal budget? Deficits can be analyzed by comparing actual figures across years, or actual figures vs. CBO baseline forecasts before and after major legislation is passed, to evaluate the effect of that legislation. Fiscal year 2018 (FY 2018) ran from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. It was the first fiscal year budgeted by President Trump. The Treasury department reported on October 15, 2018 that the budget deficit rose from $666 billion in FY2017 to $779 billion in FY2018, an increase of $113 billion or 17.0%. Tax receipts increased 0.4%, while outlays increased 3.2%. Tax revenues typically rise in a growing economy; they grow more slowly under a CBO baseline with the tax cuts than without. The 2018 deficit was an estimated 3.9% of GDP, up from 3.5% GDP in 2017. During January 2017, just prior to President Trump's inauguration, CBO forecast that the FY 2018 budget deficit would be $487 billion if laws in place at that time remained in place. The $782 billion actual result represents a $295 billion or 61% increase versus that forecast. This difference was mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which took effect in 2018, and other spending legislation. For the 2018-2027 period, CBO forecast in January 2017 that continuing Obama policies would add $9.4 trillion to the debt (i.e., sum of annual deficits for those years). However, the April 2018 CBO forecast was increased to $13.7 trillion following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other spending legislation, an increase of $4.3 trillion or 46%. This \\"current policy\\" forecast assumes the Trump tax cuts for individuals would be extended beyond their scheduled expiration date. The New York Times reported in August 2019 that: \\"The increasing levels of red ink stem from a steep falloff in federal revenue after Mr. Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts, which lowered individual and corporate tax rates, resulting in far fewer tax dollars flowing to the Treasury Department. Tax revenues for 2018 and 2019 have fallen more than $430 billion short of what the budget office predicted they would be in June 2017, before the tax law was approved that December.\\" Debates about the public debt What is the appropriate measure of public debt? Economists also debate the definition of public debt and the right measures to use in determining the debt burden carried by a country and its citizens. Common measures include: * Debt held by the public: Obligations of government to holders of marketable government securities, such as Treasury bonds. * Intra-governmental debt: Obligations of government to particular legal entities, such as the Social Security Trust Fund. * Gross or national debt: The sum of debt held by the public plus the intra-governmental debt. Both the debt held by the public in dollars and as ratio relative to the size of the economy (GDP) are common measures. The CBO reports these amounts since fiscal year 1967 in the \\"Historical Budget Data\\" accompanying their \\"Budget and Economic Outlook\\" report, published annually in January. * Debt held by the public grew in dollars an average of 12% per year from 2008 through 2016, rising from $5.8 trillion in 2008 to $14.2 trillion in 2016. * Debt held by the public rose rapidly from 39.3% in 2008 to 70.4% by 2012, then slowly grew to 77.0% by 2016. The Treasury Department provides data on the national debt at points in time through its \\"Treasury Direct\\" website. It publishes a monthly \\"Debt position and activity report\\" which includes the debt held by the public, the intra-governmental debt, and national debt (\\"Total public debt outstanding\\"). As of December 31, 2016, these amounts were: * Debt held by the public: $14.43 trillion. * Intra-governmental debt: $5.54 trillion. * National debt: $19.97 trillion. * Relative to a nominal GDP figure of $18.9 trillion for Q4 2016, national debt was approximately 106% GDP. Paul Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart testified to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform that gross debt is the appropriate measure. Certain members of the Commission are focusing on gross debt. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.Horney, James R. (May 27, 2010). \\"Recommendation that president‚Äôs fiscal commission focus on gross debt is misguided\\". Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [website]. Retrieved February 9, 2011. Intragovernmental debt There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6 trillion in February 2011. A significant portion of the intragovernmental debt is the $2.6 trillion Social Security Trust Fund.United States Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (April 30, 2010). \\"Monthly statement of public debt of the United States\\".

By contrast, > intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such > effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays > interest on) to itself. If the U.S. continues to run \\"on budget\\" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in \\"debt held by the public\\" replacing \\"intragovernmental debt\\" to the extent of the Social Security Trust Fund during the period the Trust Fund is liquidated, which is expected to occur between 2015 and the mid-2030s. This replacement of intragovernmental debt with debt held by the public would not occur if: a) The U.S. runs on-budget surpluses sufficient to offset \\"off-budget\\" deficits in the Social Security program; or b) Social Security is reformed to maintain an off-budget surplus.WSJ-A Short Primer on the National Debt-John Steele Gordon- August 2011 Is there a \\"danger level\\" of debt?

Debates about tax policy Democrats and Republicans mean very different things when they talk about tax reform. Democrats argue for the wealthy to pay more via higher income tax rates, while Republicans focus on lowering income tax rates. While both parties discuss reducing tax expenditures (i.e., exemptions and deductions), Republicans focus on preserving lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends, while Democrats prefer educational credits and capping deductions. Political realities make it unlikely that more than $150 billion per year in individual tax expenditures could be eliminated. One area with more common ground is corporate tax rates, where both parties have generally agreed that lower rates and fewer tax expenditures would align the U.S. more directly with foreign competition.Washington Post-Greg Ip-Five Myths About Tax Reform-December 14, 2012 How much tax revenue could be raised by taxing the rich more? There is a significant amount of revenue that could be raised by increasing income and wealth taxes on the richest (e.g., top 1%) of Americans, who earned roughly $600,000 or more in 2017:Washington Post-Jeff Stein-Ocasio-Cortez wants higher taxes on very rich Americans. Here's how much money that could raise-January 5, 2018 *The Washington Post reported on separate studies by two economists that concluded increasing the top marginal tax rate for the top 1% of income earners from the 2018 37% rate to a 70% rate could increase revenue by up to $3 trillion over 10 years in total. This estimate may be high because the wealthy might find methods of evading some of these increased taxes (e.g., shifting more wealth to tax-free municipal bonds). Increasing the rate to 57% instead could raise $1.7 trillion over a decade in total, while increasing it to 83% could raise $3.8 trillion over a decade in total. *The CBO estimated raising taxes on the two highest income tax brackets by just 1 percentage point (e.g., from 37% to 38%) would net about $120 billion over 10 years. This would apply to everyone who earns more than $200,000 annually. *The CBO estimated that a 0.1% financial transactions tax rate would raise $780 billion over 10 years in total. *The CBO estimated that returning the corporate tax rate to 35% (it was lowered to 21% in 2018 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) could raise an additional $1 trillion total over 10 years. *The CBO estimated that for the 2014-2023 period there would be nearly $12 trillion total in tax expenditures (e.g., deductions, exclusions, and preferential rates), approximately 17% of which ($2 trillion or $200 billion/year on average) would apply to just the top 1% of income earners. One of the largest tax expenditure for this group (roughly half) is the preferential (lower) rate charged for capital gains and dividends.CBO-The Distribution of Major Tax Expenditures in the Individual Tax System-May 29, 2013 In 2018, economist Paul Krugman summarized studies by other economists that concluded the optimal marginal tax rate would be in the 73% or higher range, in terms of revenue maximization. This is due to a combination of factors, including the rich tend to save more of each marginal dollar rather than spend it; taxing away some of this money and transferring it to lower income persons who spend it boosts economic growth and income.NYT-Paul Krugman-The Economics of Soaking the Rich-January 5, 2019 Budgetary impact of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts Congressional Research Service-Impact of Extension of the Bush Tax Cuts A variety of tax cuts were enacted under President Bush between 2001‚Äì2003 (commonly referred to as the \\"Bush tax cuts\\"), through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). Most of these tax cuts were scheduled to expire December 31, 2010. They were extended until 2013 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 and then allowed to expire for approximately the top 1% of taxpayers only as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. So what were the budgetary implications of the Bush tax cuts? * The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected two weeks prior to Obama taking office in January 2009 that the deficit in FY2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of the Bush tax cuts as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if the Bush tax cuts were extended at all income levels. Adjusting other assumptions in the CBO baseline could have raised that debt level even higher. So by this estimate, these tax cuts represented about $3 trillion in less revenue and more interest (i.e., more debt) over a decade. * In August 2010, CBO estimated that extending the tax cuts for the 2011‚Äì2020 time period would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt: $2.65 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $0.66 trillion for interest and debt service costs.Congressional Budget Office ‚Äì The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2010-Table 1.7 on Page 24 The non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts estimated in May 2010 that extending some or all of the Bush tax cuts would have the following impact under these scenarios: * Making the tax cuts permanent for all taxpayers, regardless of income, would increase the national debt $3.1 trillion over the next 10 years. * Limiting the extension to individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000 would increase the debt about $2.3 trillion in the next decade. * Extending the tax cuts for all taxpayers for only two years would cost $558 billion over the next 10 years.Pew Charitable Trusts ‚Äì Decision Time: The Fiscal Effects of Extending the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts. May 2010 The non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) has reported the 10-year revenue loss from extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts beyond 2010 at $2.9 trillion, with an additional $606 billion in debt service costs (interest), for a combined total of $3.5 trillion. CRS cited CBO estimates that extending the cuts permanently, including the repeal of the estate tax, would add 2% of GDP to the annual deficit.Congressional Research Service-Thomas Hungerford-October 27, 2010 For scale, the historical average deficit as % GDP was approximately 2.8% from 1966 to 2015, so this represented a nearly doubling of the deficit. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote in 2010: \\"The 75-year Social Security shortfall is about the same size as the cost, over that period, of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of Americans (those with incomes above $250,000 a year). Members of Congress cannot simultaneously claim that the tax cuts for people at the top are affordable while the Social Security shortfall constitutes a dire fiscal threat.\\"CBPP ‚Äì What the 2010 Trustees' Report Shows About Social Security August 2010 Can reducing income tax rates increase government revenue?

Comparison of U.S. federal revenues for two CBO forecasts, one from January 2017 (based on laws at the end of the Obama Administration) and the other from April 2018, which reflects Trump's policy changes. Key insights include: 1) Tax cuts reduce revenue collections relative to a baseline without them; 2) Tax revenues rise each year under both forecasts as the economy grows; and 3) The gap is larger initially, indicating larger stimulus effects in the earlier years.CBO-Budget and Economic Outlook-April 9, 2018 =CBO, CRS and Treasury Department studies= The Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that tax cuts do not pay for themselves; they increase the deficit relative to a policy baseline without the tax cut. For example, CBO estimated in June 2012 that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 (EGTRRA and JGTRRA) added about $1.6 trillion to the debt between 2001 and 2011, excluding interest.CBO- Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001 In August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that extending the tax cuts for the 2011-2020 time period would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, comprising $2.65 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $0.66 trillion for interest and debt service costs. A 2006 Treasury Department study estimated that the Bush tax cuts reduced revenue by approximately 1.5% GDP on average for each of the first four years after their implementation, an approximately 6% annual reduction in revenue relative to a baseline without those tax cuts. The study also indicated the Kennedy tax cuts of 1962 and Reagan tax cuts of 1981 reduced revenue. The study did not extend the analysis beyond the first four years of implementation.Department of the Treasury-OTA Working Paper 81. September 2006] The non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that: \\"The reduction in the top tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.\\"Forbes-Non Partisan CRS Tax Report Debunks Core Conservative Economic Theory-GOP Suppresses Study. November 2, 2012 =Supply side arguments= In theory, the government collects no revenue at either zero or 100% tax rates. So there is some intermediate point at which government revenue is maximized. Lowering tax rates from 100% to this hypothetical rate that maximizes revenue would theoretically raise revenue, while continuing to lower tax rates below this rate would lower revenues. This concept underlies the Laffer Curve, an element of supply-side economics. Since the 1970s, some \\"supply side\\" economists have contended that lowering marginal tax rates could stimulate economic growth to such a degree that tax revenues could rise, other factors being held constant. However, economic models and econometric analysis have found weak support for the \\"supply side\\" theory. The Treasury Department reported in 2006 that tax cuts in 1962, 1981, 2001, and 2003 all reduced revenue relative to a policy baseline without those tax cuts. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) summarized a variety of studies done by economists across the political spectrum that indicated tax cuts do not pay for themselves and increase deficits.CBPP ‚Äì Will the Tax Cuts Eventually Pay for Themselves? March 2003] Studies by the CBO and the U.S. Treasury also indicated that tax cuts do not pay for themselves.CBO StudyMankiw Study Washington Post 2007Washington Post 2006 In 2003, 450 economists, including ten Nobel Prize laureate, signed the Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts, sent to President Bush stating that \\"these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook... will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well as investments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research... [and] generate further inequalities in after-tax income.\\" Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2007: \\"Supply side doctrine, which claimed without evidence that tax cuts would pay for themselves, never got any traction in the world of professional economic research, even among conservatives.\\" The Washington Post summarized a variety of tax studies in 2007 done by both liberal and conservative economists, indicating that both income and capital gains tax cuts do not pay for themselves. Economist Nouriel Roubini wrote in October 2010 that the Republican Party was \\"trapped in a belief in voodoo economics, the economic equivalent of creationism\\" while the Democratic administration was unwilling to improve the tax system via a carbon tax or value-added tax.Financial Times- Nouriel Roubini-A Presidency Headed for a Fiscal Trainwreck-October 2010 Warren Buffett wrote in 2003: \\"When you listen to tax-cut rhetoric, remember that giving one class of taxpayer a 'break' requires ‚Äì now or down the line ‚Äì that an equivalent burden be imposed on other parties. In other words, if I get a break, someone else pays. Government can't deliver a free lunch to the country as a whole.\\"Warren Buffett-Washington Post-Dividend Voodoo-May 2003 Former Comptroller General of the United States David Walker stated during January 2009: \\"You can't have guns, butter and tax cuts.

However, after peaking in 2000, income tax revenues did not regain this peak again until 2006. After a plateau in 2007 and 2008, revenues fell markedly in 2009 and 2010 due to a financial crisis and recession. Income tax revenues in 2010 remained below their 2000 peak. Relative to GDP, income tax revenues declined during most of the 1980s (from 9.0% GDP in 1980 to 8.3% GDP in 1989), rose during most of the 1990s (from 8.1% GDP in 1990 to 9.6% GDP in 1999) then declined in the 2000s (from 10.2% GDP in 2000 to 6.5% GDP in 2009).CBO Historical Tables-1970 to 2010 The extent to which economic activity and tax policy interact to drive these trends is debated by experts. While marginal income tax rates were lowered in the early 1980s, dollar revenue increased throughout the period, although revenue relative to GDP declined. Marginal tax rates were raised during the 1990s, and both revenue dollars and revenue relative to GDP increased. Marginal rates were lowered again in the early 2000s, and both revenue and revenue relative to GDP generally declined. Can increasing tax receipts alone address the budget deficit? Estimated Funding Gaps in Medicare and Social Security. Expert panels across the political spectrum have argued for a combination of revenue increases and expense reductions to reduce the budget deficit and future debt increases. However, the nature and balance of these measures varies considerably.PGPF- Solutions Summit-May 2011 Economist Bruce Bartlett wrote in 2009 that without benefit cuts in Medicare and Social Security, federal taxes would have to increase by 8.1% of GDP now and forever to cover estimated program shortfalls, while avoiding debt increases.Forbes-Bruce Bartlett-The 81% Tax Increase-May 2009 The 30-year historical average federal tax receipts are 18.4% of GDP, so this would represent a substantial increase in tax receipts as a share of GDP relative to historical levels in the United States. However, such an increase would still leave tax revenues relative to GDP substantially lower than other developed nations like France and Germany (see: List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP). CBO estimated in August 2011 that if the Bush tax cuts and other tax cuts enacted or extended during 2009 and 2010 were allowed to expire, the budget deficit would be reduced by 2.0-3.0% GDP each year from 2013-2021.CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011-Summary Figure 1 Do tax hikes \\"kill jobs\\"? Prominent Republican Congressmen argued during President Obama's tenure that raising taxes would \\"kill\\" jobs.TPM Muckracker Website-June 23, 2011 This was a common Republican talking point heard often from 2011-2013, as debates around the United States fiscal cliff and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts continued. But is it true? What about in the short-run versus the long-run? * Short-run: Economic theory indicates that raising taxes such that the budget deficit is reduced slows the economy in the short-run, other things equal. In other words, a higher budget deficit is consistent with more economic stimulus and job creation, while a lower budget deficit means less economic stimulus and job creation. For example, the CBO forecast the economic results for 2013 under low- and high- deficit scenarios related to the United States fiscal cliff. Under the lower deficit scenario, economic growth was slower and the unemployment rate higher in 2013. This assumed the expiration of the Bush tax cuts at all income levels for 2013, as well as the payroll tax cuts enacted by President Obama. This would appear to support the Republican talking point, at least in the short- run. * Long-run: CBO also reported that higher debt levels due to extending the tax cuts could hurt economic growth and employment in the long-run: \\"Moreover, if the fiscal tightening was removed [tax cuts extended] and the policies that are currently in effect were kept in place indefinitely, a continued surge in federal debt during the rest of this decade and beyond would raise the risk of a fiscal crisis (in which the government would lose the ability to borrow money at affordable interest rates) and would eventually reduce the nation's output [and therefore employment] and income below what would occur if the fiscal tightening was allowed to take place as currently set by law.\\" So in summary, economic theory indicates tax hikes may slow job creation in the short-run, but boost it in the long-run through lower debt levels. However, this \\"other things equal\\" condition is rarely met in the real world, where many economic factors are moving simultaneously. For example, economic growth and job creation was higher during the Clinton administration (which raised income taxes) than under Reagan's (which cut income taxes). Likewise, the rate of job creation was greater under the Obama administration (which raised income taxes) than during the G. W. Bush administration (which cut income taxes). In other words, historical evidence indicates income tax hikes were consistent with periods of higher job growth in the short-run, despite the prevailing economic theory, as the \\"other things equal\\" condition may not have been met. Can the U.S. outgrow the problem? GAO Comparative Increase in Spend vs. GDP. There is debate regarding whether tax cuts, less intrusive regulation, and productivity improvements could feasibly generate sufficient economic growth to offset the deficit and debt challenges facing the country. According to David Stockman, OMB Director under President Reagan, post-1980 Republican ideology embraces the idea that the \\"economy will outgrow the deficit if plied with enough tax cuts.\\"NY Times-David Stockman-Four Defamations of the Apocalypse-August 2010 Former President George W. Bush exemplified this ideology when he wrote in 2007: \\"...it is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues.\\"Washington Post-A Heckuva Claim-January 2007 However, multiple studies by economists across the political spectrum and several government organizations argue that tax cuts increase deficits and debt.CBO-Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a Ten Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates- December 2005 The GAO estimated in 2008 that double-digit GDP growth would be required for the following 75 years to outgrow the projected increases in deficits and debt; GDP growth averaged 3.2% during the 1990s. Because mandatory spending growth rates will far exceed any reasonable growth rate in GDP and the tax base, the GAO concluded that the U.S. cannot grow its way out of the problem.GAO U.S. Fiscal Briefing 1/08 Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in April 2010: \\"Unfortunately, we cannot grow our way out of this problem.

You know what's happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.\\" From 2002 to 2011, the nine US states with the highest income taxes grew their economy 8.2%, all states with an income tax grew 6.3%, and the nine states without an income tax grew 5.2%. A more specific, frequently debated, proposal supported by prominent Democrats is to significantly increase the taxes of the top 1 percent of income earners to generate additional revenue. According to the Tax Foundation, the so-called \\"super-rich\\" accumulated more than 20 percent of the nation's total adjusted gross income in 2008 and paid 36 percent of the total income tax. Republican opponents fear that any type of large tax hike, even to the wealthy, would decrease both job creation and investment, slowing the economy even further. In an op-ed in The New York Times in August 2011, Buffett wrote in support of such a tax hike on the richest Americans, stating that the federal government should \\"stop coddling the super-rich\\" to help decrease the deficit. In response, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan challenged Buffett, and any other rich people who wanted higher taxes, to voluntarily donate the money to the IRS instead. =Corporate taxes= Federal income tax revenues have declined relative to corporate profits. effective corporate tax rate, 1947-2011 A number of US corporations claim that even the current 35 percent corporate income tax rate causes them to shift several of their operations, including their research and manufacturing facilities, overseas. For example, Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer, stated in 2009 that higher taxes \\"...makes U.S. jobs more expensive. [Microsoft is] better off taking lots of people and moving them out of the U.S. as opposed to keeping them inside the U.S.\\" Microsoft reported an overall effective tax rate of 26 percent in its 2008 annual report: \\"Our effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates\\" the report said. U.S. tax rules let companies defer paying corporate rates as high as 35 percent on most types of foreign profits as long as that money remains invested overseas. President Obama says he wants to end such incentives to keep foreign profits tax-deferred so that companies would invest them in the U.S. In comparing corporate taxes, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among OECD countries behind Japan and Germany. However, the U.S. ranked 27th lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%.CBO-Corporate Income Tax Rates International Comparison- November 2005 U.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during the third quarter of 2012, at an annualized $1.75 trillion.FRED Database- Corporate Profits After Tax-Retrieved December 13, 2012 U.S. federal corporate income tax revenues have declined relative to profits, falling from approximately 27% in 2000 to 17% in 2012.FRED Database-Corporate Profits and Federal Income tax revenues-Retrieved May 25, 2013 =U.S. taxes relative to foreign countries= Total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. in comparison to the OECD and the EU 15. Comparison of tax rates around the world is difficult and somewhat subjective. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national units (states, counties and municipalities) and the types of services rendered through those taxes are also different. One way to measure the overall tax burden is by looking at it as a percentage of the overall economy in terms of GDP. The Tax Policy Center wrote: \\"U.S. taxes are low relative to those in other developed countries. In 2006 U.S. taxes at all levels of government claimed 28 percent of GDP, compared with an average of 36 percent of GDP for the 30 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\\"Tax Policy Center Briefing Book-Retrieved 31 December 2009 Economist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: \\"The U.S. government doesn't take in much tax revenue ‚Äì at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies ‚Äì and it also doesn't spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare.\\" A comparison of taxation on individuals amongst OECD countries shows that the U.S. tax burden is just slightly below the average tax for middle income earners.International Comparison of Taxes by Australian Treasury Comparison of National Spending Per Citizen for the 20 Largest Economies. Deficit spending can distort the true total effective taxation. One way to mitigate this distortion is to evaluate spending levels. This approach shows the level of services a country is willing to accept versus what they are willing to pay. In 2010, the Federal government of the US spent an average of $11,041 per citizen (per capita). This compares to the 2010 World average spending of $2376 per citizen and an average of $16,110 per citizen for the World's 20 largest economies (in terms of GDP). Of the 20 largest economies, only six spent less per citizen: South Korea ($4557), Brazil ($2813), Russia ($2458), China ($1010), and India ($226). Of the 13 that spent more, Norway and Sweden top the list with per citizen spending of $40908 and $26760 respectively.CIA World Factbook, population data from 2010, Spending and GDP data from 2011 In comparing corporate taxes, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among OECD countries behind Japan and Germany. However, the U.S. ranked 27th lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%.Corporate Income Tax Rates: International Comparisons Bruce Bartlett wrote in May 2011: \\"...one almost never hears that total revenues are at their lowest level in two or three generations as a share of G.D.P. or that corporate tax revenues as a share of G.D.P. are the lowest among all major countries. One hears only that the statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is high compared with other countries, which is true but not necessarily relevant. The economic importance of statutory tax rates is blown far out of proportion by Republicans looking for ways to make taxes look high when they are quite low.\\"NYT-Bruce Bartlett-Are Taxes in the U.S. High or Low?-May 2011 =Can tax rate cuts be paid for by reducing deductions and exemptions?= CBO charts describing amount and distribution of top 10 tax expenditures (i.e., exemptions, deductions, and preferential rates) Tax expenditures (i.e., exclusions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits) cause revenues to be much lower than they would otherwise be for any given tax rate structure. The benefits from tax expenditures, such as income exclusions for healthcare insurance premiums paid for by employers and tax deductions for mortgage interest, are distributed unevenly across the income spectrum. They are often what the Congress offers to special interests in exchange for their support. According to a report from the CBO that analyzed the 2013 data: * The top 10 tax expenditures totaled $900 billion. This is a proxy for how much they reduced revenues or increased the annual budget deficit. * Tax expenditures tend to benefit those at the top and bottom of the income distribution, but less so in the middle. * The top 20% of income earners received approximately 50% of the benefit from them; the top 1% received 17% of the benefits. * The largest single tax expenditure was the exclusion from income of employer sponsored health insurance ($250 billion). * Preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividends were $160 billion; the top 1% received 68% of the benefit or $109 billion from lower income tax rates on these types of income. Understanding how each tax expenditure is distributed across the income spectrum can inform policy choices. The Congressional Research Service reported that even though there is more than $1 trillion per year in tax expenditures, it is unlikely that more than $150 billion/year could be cut due to political support for various deductions and exemptions. For example, according to the Tax Policy Center, the home mortgage deduction accounted for $75 billion in foregone revenue in 2011 but over 33 million households (roughly one-third) benefited from it.

By this measure, spending has increased about 1% GDP more than revenues have declined. Using the historical (1971‚Äì2008) average spending of 20.6% GDP and revenues of 18.2%, the spending increase of 3.2% GDP is smaller than the revenue decline of 3.3% GDP. In other words, the \\"spending problem\\" and \\"revenue problem\\" are comparable in size.CBO Historical Tables ‚Äì January 2011 Recessions typically cause spending to rise on social safety net programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, while tax revenues decline due to unemployment and reduced economic activity.NYT-Recession is Culprit in High U.S. Debt.

FY 2012 revenue of 15.7% GDP was 1.9% below 2008 levels, while FY 2012 spending of 22.7% GDP was 1.9% GDP above 2008 levels, indicating the revenue and spending \\"problems\\" were of comparable size.CBO Monthly Budget Review for September 2012-October 5, 2012 Nonetheless, federal spending, which peaked under the Reagan administration, has subsequently been in decline as a share of national income. The argument has therefore been made the deficit exists as a result of declining income rather than excessive spending.http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2013/0313friedman.html =Long-term= In the long-run, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to increase dramatically relative to GDP, while other categories of spending are expected to remain relatively constant. The Congressional Budget Office expects Medicare and Medicaid to rise from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. So in the long-run, spending on these programs is the key issue, far outweighing any revenue consideration.CBO Long- Term Budget Outlook-June 2010 Economist Paul Krugman has made the argument that any serious attempt to tackle long-run deficit problems can be summed up in \\"seven words: health care, health care, health care, revenue.\\"Krugman, Paul.

In other cases, earmarks refer to directions in appropriation committee reports, which are not law. Various organizations have estimated the total number and amount of earmarks. An estimated 16,000 earmarks containing nearly $48 billion in spending were inserted into larger, often unrelated bills during 2005. While the number of earmarks has grown in the past decade, the total amount of earmarked funds is approximately 1-2 percent of federal spending.Harvard Briefing Paper Fraud, waste and abuse The Office of Management and Budget estimated that the federal government made $98 billion in \\"improper payments\\" during FY2009, an increase of 38% vs. the $72 billion the prior year. This increase was due in part to effects of the financial crisis and improved methods of detection. The total included $54 billion for healthcare-related programs, 9.4% of the $573 billion spent on those programs. The government pledged to do more to combat this problem, including better analysis, auditing, and incentives.OMB Blog-Improper Payments-November 2009 During July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, citing approximately $110 billion in unauthorized payments of all types.Whitehouse-Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act Former GAO Director David Walker said in 2008: \\"Some people think that we can solve our financial problems by stopping fraud, waste and abuse or by canceling the Bush tax cuts or by ending the war in Iraq.

Movie Byte Sized-YouTube Excerpt ‚Äì Quote About 26 Minutes In Stimulus packages CBO estimates of the impact of the stimulus on GDP Fiscal stimulus can be characterized as investment, spending or tax cuts. For example, if the funds are used to create a physical asset that generates future cash flows (e.g., a power plant or toll road), the stimulus could be characterized as investment. Extending unemployment benefits are examples of government spending. Tax cuts may or may not be spent. There is significant debate among economists regarding which type of stimulus has the highest \\"multiplier\\" (i.e., increase in economic activity per dollar of stimulus). Fiscal stimulus is enacted by laws passed by Congress, which is distinct from monetary policy conducted by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, which involves interest rates and the money supply. Recent specific stimulus laws included the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The former was primarily tax cuts, while the latter included a blend of tax cuts, investment and spending. The CBO initially estimated that ARRA would increase the federal budget deficit by $185 billion during 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, by $134 billion in 2011, for a total of $787 billion over the 2009-2019 period.CBO-Budgetary Impact of ARRA The total was later revised to $825 billion.CBO-Estimated Impact of ARRA-August 2011 There is significant debate on whether fiscal stimulus is actually effective in creating jobs and boosting the economy, with critics claiming that all it does is increase the deficit unnecessarily. CBO estimated in August 2011 that ARRA had significant positive effects on GDP and employment. For example, during 2010 the incremental effect on GDP ranged between 1.1 and 4.6 percentage points, the unemployment rate was lowered between 0.7 and 2.0 percentage points, additional employed persons ranged from 1.3 million to 3.6 million, and the number of full-time equivalent jobs added ranged from 1.8 million to 5.2 million. Even after the Act spending stops in 2011, CBO estimated it will increase the number of people employed in 2012 by between 0.4 million and 1.1 million. Beyond discrete stimulus packages, federal spending tends to increase during recessions due to \\"automatic stabilizers\\" such as unemployment compensation and nutrition programs. For example, during May 2010 CBO estimated that \\"automatic stabilizers added the equivalent of 1.9% of potential GDP to the [2009] deficit, an amount substantially greater than the 0.3% added in 2008. According to CBO's baseline projections, the contribution of automatic stabilizers to the budget deficit will be roughly 2.3% of potential GDP in 2010 and 2.5% of potential GDP in 2011.\\"CBO-The Effect of Automatic Stabilizers on the Federal Budget-May 2010 Other debate topics Analyzing debt changes across Presidential terms Comparison of annual federal deficits (CBO 10-year forecast from prior to inauguration vs. the actual amount), during the Obama and G.W. Bush presidencies. Bush added far more to the debt relative to the CBO 2001 forecast than Obama added relative to the CBO 2009 forecast. Analyzing the impact of a President on budget deficits and debt is challenging. Presidents inherit a \\"deficit trajectory\\" from their predecessors. In January each year, CBO publishes its \\"Budget and Economic Outlook\\" report which forecasts the deficit and debt changes over the following decade, among other variables. This is referred to as the \\"current law baseline\\" which is based on laws in effect at that point time and expected economic conditions. This can be used as a baseline for comparison of actual performance thereafter, bearing in mind economic conditions can change significantly relative to the assumptions made in the initial forecast. Comparing against the initial baseline allows the impact of policies to be isolated. For example, in January 2001 (when President G.W. Bush was inaugurated) CBO forecast that for fiscal years (FY) 2001-2008 the U.S. would have budget surpluses totaling $3.7 trillion, assuming strong economic conditions would continue.CBO ‚Äì Budget & Economic Outlook 2002‚Äì2011. January 2001] The actual sum of annual deficits (debt) during that period was $1.8 trillion, a $5.5 trillion turn for the worse. This was due to a combination of increased defense spending in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Bush tax cuts, and a recession in 2001, offset somewhat by incremental revenue due to a significant housing bubble that built during the period. The major deficit increase in fiscal year 2009 (the last year budgeted by President Bush) reflected the Great Recession. Recall that fiscal year 2009 ran from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Although that fiscal year overlaps with President Obama's tenure, it could still arguably be included with President Bush's performance. In other words, this analysis could reasonably be conducted for fiscal years 2002-2009 for President Bush, as those are the years he budgeted, which would significantly worsen his performance as the deficit increase in 2009 was $1.4 trillion. In January 2009 (when President Barack Obama was inaugurated), CBO forecast a $3.7 trillion in total deficit increases (debt) during the FY2009 to 2016 period. However, the actual deficits totaled $7.3 trillion, a $3.6 trillion turn for the worse.CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2017‚Äì2027 June 2017 Baseline. Retrieved December 20, 2017 This difference was mainly driven by the Great Recession being worse than initially anticipated. Another major driver was resolution of the fiscal cliff. President Obama initially extended the expiration of the Bush tax cuts from 2010 to 2013 to avoid slowing the recovery, then allowed them to expire for the top 1% of income earners in 2013, preserving roughly 80% of the dollar value of the tax cut thereafter. The CBO baseline had assumed their expiration in 2010, so the extension and then partial expiration all added to the deficit relative to the 2009 baseline forecast. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the main stimulus bill during the Obama era, was roughly $800 billion of this increase as well. For comparisons across longer periods of time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is a more effective comparison than comparing raw dollars. Since the country is aging, more recent Presidents are likely to run higher deficits relative to GDP due to higher healthcare and Social Security costs. For example, the current law baseline for President Trump as of January 2017 includes a $10.7 trillion debt increase over the 2018‚Äì2027 period, significantly larger than either of his predecessors, with deficits averaging around 5% GDP instead of the historical 3% GDP. This is before consideration of his tax plan, which is represents a $1.5 trillion increase in debt relative to the baseline. Further, comparing dollars across administrations ignores the economic conditions expected at the time. President's Bush and Trump inherited excellent economic conditions, while President Obama did not. 2010 Budget Proposal 2010 Budget: Projected Deficits and Debt Increases President Barack Obama proposed his 2010 budget during February, 2009. He has indicated that health care, clean energy, education, and infrastructure will be priorities. The proposed increases in the national debt exceed $900 billion each year from 2010‚Äì2019, following the Bush administration's outgoing budget which allowed for a $1.4 trillion increase in the national debt for FY 2009.Federal Budget Summary Tables Tax cuts will expire for the wealthiest taxpayers to increase revenues, returning marginal rates to the Clinton levels. Further, the base Department of Defense budget increases slightly through 2014 (Table S-7), from $534 to $575 billion, although supplemental appropriations for the Iraq War are expected to be reduced. In addition, estimates of revenue are based on GDP growth assumptions that exceed the Blue Chip Economists' consensus forecast considerably through 2012 (Table S-8).2010 Budget Washington Post-Montgomery-Battle Lines Quickly Set Over Planned Policy Shifts State finances The U.S. federal government may be required to assist state governments further, as many U.S. states are facing budget shortfalls due to the 2008‚Äì2010 recession. The sharp decline in home prices has affected property tax revenue, while the decline in economic activity and consumer spending has led to a falloff in revenues from state sales taxes and income taxes. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the 2010 and 2011 state shortfalls will total $375 billion.CBPP ‚Äì Recession Continues to Batter State Budgets.

February 23, 2011 GAO estimates that (absent policy changes) state and local governments will face budget gaps that rise from 1% of GDP in 2010 to around 2% by 2020, 2.5% by 2030, and 3.5% by 2040.Rockefeller Institute ‚Äì Boyd Presentation. November 2009] Further, many states have underfunded pensions, meaning the state has not contributed the amount estimated to be necessary to pay future obligations to retired workers. The Pew Center on the States reported in February 2010 that states have underfunded their pensions by nearly $1 trillion as of 2008, representing the gap between the $2.35 trillion states had set aside to pay for employees' retirement benefits and the $3.35 trillion price tag of those promises.Pew Center on the States ‚Äì The Trillion Dollar Gap . February 2010] Whether a U.S. state can declare bankruptcy, enabling it to re-negotiate its obligations to bondholders, pensioners, and public employee unions is a matter of legal and political debate. Journalist Matt Miller explained some of these issues in February 2011: \\"The AG [State Attorney General] might put a plan forward and agree to conditions. However, the AG has no say over the legislature. And only a legislature can raise taxes. In some cases, it would require a state constitutional amendment to reduce pensions. Add to this a federal judge who would oversee the process...and a state has sovereign immunity, which means the governor or legislature may simply refuse to go along with anything the judge rules or reject the reorganization plan itself.\\" Entitlement trust funds Both Social Security and Medicare are funded by payroll tax revenues dedicated to those programs. Program tax revenues historically have exceeded payouts, resulting in program surpluses and the building of trust fund balances. The trust funds earn interest. Both Social Security and Medicare each have two component trust funds. As of FY2008, Social Security had a combined $2.4 trillion trust fund balance and Medicare's was $380 billion. If during an individual year program payouts exceed the sum of tax income and interest earned during that year (i.e., an annual program deficit), the trust fund for the program is drawn down to the extent of the shortfall. Legally, the mandatory nature of these programs compels the government to fund them to the extent of tax income plus any remaining trust fund balances, borrowing as needed. Once the trust funds are eliminated through expected future deficits, technically these programs can only draw on payroll taxes during the current year. In effect, they are \\"pay as you go\\" programs, with additional legal claims to the extent of their remaining trust fund balances.Social Security Trustees Report ‚Äì 2009 Summary Credit rating downgrade In April 2011, rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P;) issued a \\"negative\\" outlook on the U.S. \\"AAA\\" (highest quality) debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there is a one in three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. According to S&P;, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a \\"stable\\" outlook. Losing the AAA rating would likely mean higher interest rates and the sale of treasury bonds by entities required to hold AAA securities.MSNBC ‚Äì S&P; Issues Negative Outlook. April 19, 2011 On August 5, 2011, representatives from S&P; announced the company's decision to give a first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to \\"AA+\\", with a negative outlook. S&P; wrote: \\"The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics...the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy-making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011.\\" See also * Political debates about United States military bands * United States debt ceiling * United States fiscal cliff * Fiscal sustainability References External links * CBO Budget & Economic Outlook 2017-2027 * CBO Long-Term Budget Outlook-June 2012 * The Hamilton Project-A Dozen Economic Facts About Tax Reform-May 2012 * GAO-U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing-January 2008 * Commonwealth Club of California-Dr. Yaron Brook and Dr. David Callahan: Is Capitalism Moral?

It also includes the daisy flowering plant Rhanterium. The park has guarded shelters for tourists who frequent the area (guards are stationed throughout the park). Research also takes place in the park, since the site is home to a number of prehistoric artifacts which are studied to learn about the different stages of human history from the Holocene up to World War II. The park covers nearly the entire Grand Erg Oriental within Tunisia. In the western portion, there are 'gigantic boulders' which were formed through weathering of plutonic rocks. Fauna The park is home to a variety of wildlife including the fennec fox, horned viper, cobra, jackal, and the barbary sheep, which are endemic to the region.

Government agencies including the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),and the U.S. Treasury Department have reported that the federal government is facing a series of important long-run financing challenges, mainly driven by an aging population, rising healthcare costs per person, and rising interest payments on the national debt. CBO reported in July 2014 that the continuation of present tax and spending policies for the long-run (into the 2030s) results in a budget trajectory that causes debt to grow faster than GDP, which is \\"unsustainable.\\" Further, CBO reported that high levels of debt relative to GDP may pose significant risks to economic growth and the ability of lawmakers to respond to crises. These risks can be addressed by higher taxes, reduced spending, or combination of both.CBO Long-Term Budget Outlook. July 15, 2014 The U.S. reported budget surpluses in only four years between 1970-2020, during fiscal years 1998-2001, the last four years budgeted by President Bill Clinton. The Clinton surpluses were due to a combination of a booming economy, higher taxes on the rich implemented in 1993, defense spending restraint, and capital gains tax revenues due to a stock market bubble. CBO estimated in April 2018 that the national debt would increase between $11.6 trillion and $13.6 trillion over the 2018-2027 period. These estimates are significantly higher than the January 2017 estimate of $9.4 trillion or the June 2017 estimate of $10.1 trillion, which represented the initial budget scenarios inherited by President Trump. The difference is driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. These amounts are on top of the $21 trillion national debt as of April 2018. Debt held by the public, a subset of the overall debt, is expected to rise from 77% GDP in 2017 to over 100% GDP by 2028. The 2017 debt to GDP level ranked 43rd highest out of 207 countries.CIA World Factbook-Debt to GDP- Retrieved May 17, 2018 CBO periodically updates an extensive listing of budget deficit reduction options.CBO-Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2019-2028-December 13, 2018 CBO estimated that the U.S. will have a post-WW2 record budget deficit of nearly $4 trillion in fiscal year 2020 (17.9% GDP), due to measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Understanding key terms CBO: U.S. Federal spending and revenue components for fiscal year 2019. Major expenditure categories are healthcare, Social Security, and defense; income and payroll taxes are the primary revenue sources. CBO: Revenue and Expense as % GDP. Since 1970, the U.S. had budget surpluses only from 1998-2001, years budgeted by President Clinton. Deficits are projected to grow as a % GDP as the country ages and healthcare cost rise faster than the economy. U.S. federal budget deficits and surpluses 1967-2016 historical and 2017-2027 forecast. Deficits as a share of GDP are expected to rise as spending for Social Security, Medicare, and interest on the federal debt rise faster than revenue. A budget deficit refers to expenditures that exceed tax collections during a given period and require borrowing to fund the difference. The U.S. federal government has run annual deficits in 36 of the past 40 fiscal years, with surpluses from 1998‚Äì2001. Debt represents the accumulation of deficits over time. Debt held by the public, a partial measure of the U.S. national debt representing securities held by investors, rose in dollar terms each year except during the 1998‚Äì2001 surplus period. Total national debt rose in dollar terms each year from 1972‚Äì2014.U.S. Treasury Direct ‚Äì Historical Debt Outstanding. Retrieved October 2014 The budget deficit and debt challenge can be described using various measures:CBO ‚Äì An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022. August 22, 2012 * Dollars: The 2014 deficit was approximately $486 billion, with tax revenues of $3.0 trillion and spending or outlays of $3.5 trillion. CBO projected in February 2013 that the debt held by the public will rise from $11.3 trillion in 2012 to $18.9 trillion in 2022 under its \\"baseline scenario,\\" an increase of $7.6 trillion over 10 years. The total national debt will rise from $16 trillion in 2012 to $25 trillion by 2022, an increase of $9 trillion.CBO Budget and Economic Outlook. February 2013 * Deficit as percentage of the size of the economy (GDP): The historical average annual deficit pre-2008 was about 3% GDP, with 18% GDP average tax revenues and 21% GDP average expenditures. However, in 2009 the deficit rose to 10% GDP due to a combination of economic conditions and policy choices. It then fell as a % of GDP for five consecutive years back to 2.8% GDP in 2014. With GDP of $16.8 trillion in 2013, 1% GDP represents approximately $170 billion. * Debt as a percentage of GDP: Debt held by the public ranged between 23% GDP and 50% GDP during the 1971‚Äì2007 period, then rose significantly in the wake of the financial crisis and recession, ending FY2014 at about 75% GDP. As of September 30, 2014 debt held by the public was approximately $12.8 trillion. Intra-governmental debt, such as the Social Security trust fund, was at $5.0 trillion, giving a combined public debt or national debt of $17.8 trillion or about 105% GDP.Treasury Direct ‚Äì Monthly Statement of the Public Debt ‚Äì January 2013 The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue rising if the U.S. continues current policies. * Unfunded liabilities: This is an actuarial concept used to measure the value in today's dollars of a difference between tax revenue and expenditures for particular programs. This concept is described further below in the sections on Social Security and Medicare. CBO projections Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline scenario comparisons: June 2017 (essentially the deficit trajectory that President Trump inherited from President Obama), April 2018 (which reflects Trump's tax cuts and spending bills), and April 2018 alternate scenario (which assumes extension of the Trump tax cuts, among other current policy extensions). CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2018-2028-April 9, 2018 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a key official source of budget historical information and projections of future revenues, expenses, deficits, and debt under various scenarios. Overview John Maynard Keynes wrote that: \\"The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury.\\" In other words, when the economy is doing well (a boom), that is the time to raise taxes and cut spending (austerity, to reduce deficits), while the reverse is applicable when the economy is in recession (a slump), at which time lowering taxes and raising spending (stimulus, to increase deficits) is the proper remedy.NYT- Paul Krugman-Keynes Was Right-December 29, 2011 CBO reported in January 2017: \\"To avoid the negative consequences of high and rising federal debt and to put debt on a sustainable path, lawmakers will have to make significant changes to tax and spending policies‚Äîincreasing revenues more than they would under current law, reducing spending for large benefit programs below the projected amounts, or adopting some combination of those approaches.\\"CBO Budget & Economic Outlook 2017-2027-January 24, 2017 CBO reported in November 2013 that addressing the long-term debt challenge would require reducing future budget deficits. Lawmakers would need to increase revenues further relative to the size of the economy, decrease spending on Social Security or major health care programs relative to current law, cut other federal spending to even lower levels by historical standards, or adopt a combination of these approaches.CBO ‚Äì Options for Reducing the Deficit. November 2013 CBO reported that: \\"The amount of deficit reduction that would be needed would depend on lawmakers‚Äô objectives for federal debt. For example: * Decreasing that debt in 2038 to just below 70% GDP‚Äîslightly less than what it is now but still quite high by historical standards‚Äîcould be achieved if deficits were reduced by $2 trillion (excluding interest costs) during the next decade, and the reduction in the deficit as a percentage of output in 2023 was maintained in later years. * Lowering the debt in 25 years to about 30% GDP‚Äîwhich would be a little below the average over the past 40 years‚Äîcould be achieved by reducing deficits by $4 trillion (excluding interest costs) during the next decade and maintaining that reduction in subsequent years. * Achieving savings of $2 trillion or more during the 2014‚Äì2023 period would require significant increases in taxes, significant cuts in federal benefits or services, or both.\\" CBO baseline projections In January 2017, the Congressional Budget Office reported its baseline budget projections for the 2017‚Äì2027 time periods, based on laws in place as of the end of the Obama administration. CBO forecasted that \\"debt held by the public\\" would increase from $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $24.9 trillion by 2027, an increase of $10.7 trillion. These increases are primarily driven by an aging population, which impacts the costs of Social Security and Medicare, along with interest on the debt. As President Trump introduces his budgetary policies, the impact can be measured against this baseline. CBO also estimated that if policies in place as of the end of the Obama administration continued over the following decade, real GDP would grow at approximately 2% per year, the unemployment rate would remain around 5%, inflation would remain around 2%, and interest rates would rise moderately. President Trump's economic policies can also be measured against this baseline. Budget deficit in FY2017 Fiscal year 2017 (FY2017) ran from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017; President Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, so he began office in the fourth month of the fiscal year, which was budgeted by President Obama. In FY2017, the actual budget deficit was $666 billion, $80 billion more than FY2016. FY2017 revenues were up $48 billion (1%) vs. FY2016, while spending was up $128 billion (3%). The deficit was $107 billion more than the CBO January 2017 baseline forecast of $559 billion. The deficit increased to 3.5% GDP, up from 3.2% GDP in 2016 and 2.4% GDP in 2015. Budget deficit in FY2018 Fiscal year 2018 (FY 2018) ran from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. It was the first fiscal year budgeted by President Trump. The budget deficit increased from $665 billion in 2017 to $779 billion in 2018, an increase of $114 billion or 17%. The budget deficit increased from 3.5% GDP in 2017 to 3.9% GDP in 2018. Compared to the budget deficit of $487 billion forecast for 2018 by CBO just prior to Trump's inauguration, the actual budget deficit was up $292 billion or 60%. This was mainly due to a revenue shortfall of about $275 billion relative to forecast, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.CBO Budget Projections and Historical Tables- Retrieved August 5, 2019 Ten year forecasts 2018‚Äì2028 The CBO estimated the impact of Trump's tax cuts and separate spending legislation over the 2018‚Äì2028 period in their annual \\"Budget & Economic Outlook\\", released in April 2018: * CBO forecasts a stronger economy over the 2018‚Äì2019 periods than do many outside economists, blunting some of the deficit impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. * Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP, a key measure of economic growth, is expected to increase 3.3% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2019, versus 2.6% in 2017. It is projected to average 1.7% from 2020‚Äì2026 and 1.8% in 2027‚Äì2028. Over 2017‚Äì2027, real GDP is expected to grow 2.0% on average under the April 2018 baseline, versus 1.9% under the June 2017 baseline. * The non- farm employment level would be about 1.1 million higher on average over the 2018‚Äì2028 period, about 0.7% level higher than the June 2017 baseline. * The budget deficit in fiscal 2018 (which runs from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018, the first year budgeted by President Trump) is forecast to be $804 billion, an increase of $139 billion (21%) from the $665 billion in 2017 and up $242 billion (39%) over the previous baseline forecast (June 2017) of $580 billion for 2018. The June 2017 forecast was essentially the budget trajectory inherited from President Obama; it was prepared prior to the Tax Act and other spending increases under President Trump. * For the 2018‚Äì2027 period, CBO projects the sum of the annual deficits (i.e., debt increase) to be $11.7 trillion, an increase of $1.6 trillion (16%) over the previous baseline (June 2017) forecast of $10.1 trillion. * The $1.6 trillion debt increase includes three main elements: 1) $1.7 trillion less in revenues due to the tax cuts; 2) $1.0 trillion more in spending; and 3) Partially offsetting incremental revenue of $1.1 trillion due to higher economic growth than previously forecast. The $1.6 trillion figure is approximately $12,700 per family or $4,900 per person total. * Debt held by the public is expected to rise from 78% of GDP ($16 trillion) at the end of 2018 to 96% GDP ($29 trillion) by 2028. That would be the highest level since the end of World War Two. * CBO estimated under an alternative scenario (in which policies in place as of April 2018 are maintained beyond scheduled initiation or expiration) that deficits would be considerably higher, rising by $13.7 trillion over the 2018‚Äì2027 period, an increase of $3.6 trillion (36%) over the June 2017 baseline forecast. Maintaining current policies for example would include extending the individual Trump tax cuts past their scheduled expiration in 2025, among other changes. The $3.6 trillion figure is approximately $28,500 per household or $11,000 per person total. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated that the legislation passed by the Donald Trump Administration would add significantly to the national debt over the 2018‚Äì2028 window, relative to a baseline without that legislation: * Debt held by the public in 2028 would increase from $27.0 trillion to $29.4 trillion, an increase of $2.4 trillion. * Debt held by the public as a percent of GDP in 2028 would increase from 93% GDP to 101% GDP. * Deficits would begin to exceed $1 trillion each year starting with 2019, reaching $1.7 trillion by 2028. * Deficits would rise from 3.5% GDP in 2017 to 5.3% GDP in 2019 and 5.7% GDP by 2028. * Under an alternate scenario where the Trump tax cuts for individuals are extended (among other assumptions), the debt would reach $33.0 trillion or 113% GDP in 2028. Long-term CBO projected in July 2014 that: * \\"The gap between federal spending and revenues would widen after 2015 under the assumptions of the extended baseline...By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5% GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt held by the public would reach 106% of GDP, more than in any year except 1946‚Äîeven without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt.\\" * \\"Beyond the next 25 years, the pressures caused by rising budget deficits and debt would become even greater unless laws governing taxes and spending were changed. With deficits as big as the ones that CBO projects, federal debt would be growing faster than GDP, a path that would ultimately be unsustainable.\\" Risks There are several risks associated with high and rising debt levels. However, when an economy is growing slowly and unemployment is elevated, there is risk that a budget deficit is too small. When the private sector is unable to grow the economy sufficiently, government spending can make up for the shortfall, although this increases the deficit and debt in the short-run. Many economists have argued, as Keynes did, that the time for fiscal austerity is during the economic boom, not the bust.CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS ‚Äì Larry Summers Interview Transcript.

July 2011 High debt levels The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to high and rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication: * A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur; * If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged; * Rising interest costs would force reductions in important government programs; * Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and * An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010). \\"Federal debt and the risk of a fiscal crisis\\". Congressional Budget Office: Macroeconomic Analysis Division. Retrieved February 2, 2011. Risks to economic growth from reducing deficits Reducing the budget deficit by tax increases or spending cuts may slow economic growth. One example was the United States fiscal cliff which referred to a series of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect at the end of 2012. The risks arose primarily from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and implementation of the Budget Control Act of 2011. CBO projected that economic growth would have slowed considerably in 2013 if the tax hikes and spending cuts had gone into effect, with the 2013 GDP growth rate dropping from +1.7% to -0.5% (causing a mild recession) and higher unemployment. Most of the tax increases were avoided by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, although the spending cuts from the Budget Control Act (also referred to as \\"the sequester\\") were not addressed. Loss of credit rating A lowered credit rating can result in investors demanding higher interest rates or more difficulty raising funds in global financial markets. On August 5, 2011, S&P; made the decision to give a first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to a \\"AA+\\" rating, with a negative outlook. S&P; stated that \\"[w]e lowered our long-term rating on the U.S. because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process.\\" However, despite the lowered credit rating by S&P;, other agencies did not follow suit and the U.S. has been able to borrow at record low interest rates through November 2012.FRED Database ‚Äì 10 Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate. Retrieved November 20, 2012 Fiscal crisis and inflation There is a risk that some investors may someday decide that the deficit or debt is out of control and refuse to invest in U.S. Treasury bonds. This would likely mean that the Federal Reserve would have to purchase them, increasing inflation due to money creation. However, in 2012 both interest rates and inflation were extremely low, indicating this risk was very unlikely to be realized in the short-run. In traditional economic models, inflation becomes more of a risk when the economy is closer to its capacity, because consumers are demanding more goods and services relative to supply, bidding up prices. There is significant slack in the economy since the 2008 crisis began, making inflation unlikely. Further, if the economy strongly picked up and inflation became a risk, the deficit would likely fall due to higher tax revenue and lower safety net costs, lowering the risk of a fiscal crisis.Neil Irwin & Joe Scarborough. \\"Paul Krugman and the economist-pundit divide on debt and deficits\\". Washington Post. January 31, 2013 General strategies for deficit reduction Discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue increases over nine- year intervals Strategies for addressing the deficit problem may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. These policy decisions may be evaluated in the context of a framework:CBO ‚Äì Choices for Deficit Reduction. November 2012 * Promote economic growth and employment: A fast- growing economy offers the win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie to divide, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. * Make equitable trade-offs: Many budget choices have win-lose outcomes, reflecting how government revenues are divided, with some benefiting and others incurring costs. For example, taking away benefits from those in or near retirement may be considered inequitable, while phasing out retirement benefits for younger workers may be considered less so. * Keep short- and long-term issues in perspective: Healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are the primary long-term deficit drivers. Unemployment and various tax and spending policy choices are the primary short-term deficit drivers. Measures to encourage economic growth today can be implemented along with other measures to reduce future deficits.Alice M. Rivlin Congressional Testimony. January 2009 * Limit or avoid future spending increases: Policy choices may focus on preventing future increases via freezes or reducing annual rates of increase. Annual growth rates since 2001 in the top three expenditure categories (Healthcare, Social Security, and Defense) are far above the economic growth rate. In the long-run, expenditures related to healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are projected to grow faster than the economy overall as the population matures.Charlie Rose Show Senators Bayh, Gregg and Roger Altman. February 1, 2010 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Right Target: Stabilize the Federal Debt. January 2010 * Invest productively: Some spending can be categorized as investments that lower future deficits. For example, if infrastructure, education or R&D; investments could make U.S. workers and products more competitive or generate a revenue stream, these could reduce future deficits. Examples might include installing windows that reduce energy costs, toll roads and bridges, or power plants. * Avoid uncertainty and unnecessary regulation: Complex legislation may create uncertainty regarding future costs of doing business, which affects investment decisions made by businesses and households.U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Another Pivot Back to Jobs. Retrieved September 2011 * Implement budget process reforms: Budget rules could be implemented that require new legislation or programs to be funded by either cutting other spending or raising taxes (i.e., \\"Pay as you go\\" or PAYGO rules.)GAO ‚Äì U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing. David Walker. January 2008 Historically, government spending increased year-over-year in nominal (i.e., unadjusted for inflation) terms from 1971 to 2009. However, by limiting the rate of growth in discretionary spending (defense and non-defense) while growing revenues, the budget was balanced from 1998‚Äì2001. From 1990 to 1999, discretionary spending grew by a total of 14%, while revenues grew 77%. In contrast, from 2000‚Äì2009, discretionary spending grew by a total of 101% while revenues grew only 4% (see graphic at right).CBO Historical Tables 1971‚Äì2010 Though a balanced budget is ideal, allowing down payment on debt and more flexibility within government budgeting, limiting deficits to within 1% to 2% of GDP is sufficient to stabilize the debt. Revenue proposals Waterfall chart shows cause of change from deficit in 1994 to surplus in 2001, measured as a % GDP. Income tax revenues rose as a % GDP, while defense spending and interest fell relative to GDP. Democrats and Republicans mean very different things when they talk about tax reform. Democrats argue for the wealthy to pay more via higher income tax rates, while Republicans focus on lowering income tax rates. While both parties discuss reducing tax expenditures (i.e., exemptions and deductions), Republicans focus on preserving lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends, while Democrats prefer educational credits and capping deductions. Political realities make it unlikely that more than $150 billion per year in individual tax expenditures could be eliminated. One area with more common ground is corporate tax rates, where both parties have generally agreed that lower rates and fewer tax expenditures would align the U.S. more directly with foreign competition.Greg Ip. \\"Five Myths About Tax Reform\\". Washington Post. December 14, 2012 Historical perspective Federal tax revenue averaged 17.8% GDP from 1980 to 2007, prior to the Great Recession. From 2008-2018, it averaged 16.4% GDP, due to a combination of a recovering economy, the partial extension of the Bush Tax Cuts (Obama extended roughly 80% of the dollar value) and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act under President Trump. For scale, 1% GDP represented about $200 billion in 2018, so this 1.4% GDP gap is about $280 billion less tax revenue collected per year relative to the pre- crisis average. Since 1969, the highest level of federal tax receipts was 20% GDP during 2000, and the lowest level was 14.6% GDP in 2009-2010 due to the Great Recession. The budget deficit in 2018 was about $800 billion, while the sum of annual deficits for the 2018-2027 period was estimated at $13.0 trillion, assuming the continuation of policies in place in 2018.CBO-Budget & Economic Outlook 2019-2029-January 28, 2019 Income tax revenue CBO estimated in 2018 that increasing individual income tax rates by just 1 percentage point as of January 1, 2019 for some or all tax brackets could bring in $123 billion to $905 billion over the 2019-2028 period: *All tax brackets: $905 billion. *Four highest brackets: $223 billion. *Two highest brackets: $123 billion. Raising these rates by more than 1 percentage point would bring in more revenue, but not necessarily in a straight-line calculation. =Actions during Obama Administration= President Obama faced a difficult challenge in 2010, when the Bush tax cuts were initially scheduled to expire. Due to the ongoing Great Recession, he extended those cuts through 2013. During July 2012, he proposed allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for individual taxpayers earning over $200,000 and couples earning over $250,000, which represents the top 2% of income earners. Reverting to Clinton-era tax rates for these taxpayers would mean increases in the top rates to 36% and 39.6% from 33% and 35%. This would raise approximately $850 billion in revenue over a decade. It would also mean raising the tax rate on investment income, which is highly concentrated among the wealthy, to 20% from 15%.NYT Editorial Board. The Need to Agree to Agree. July 2012 Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at all income levels would have a significant deficit reduction effect. In August 2010, CBO estimated that extending the tax cuts for the 2011‚Äì2020 time period would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt: $2.7 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $0.7 trillion for interest and debt service costs.CBO ‚Äì The Budget and Economic Outlook.

Table 1.7 on p. 24 The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 resulted in the expiration of the lower Bush income tax rates for individual taxpayers earning over $400,000 and couples earning over $450,000.

In effect, this extended the Bush tax cuts for roughly 80% of their dollar value.CBO ‚Äì Budget and Economic Outlook ‚Äì 2013 to 2023 By 2015, the budget deficit was 2.4%, below the 1980-2007 historical average of 2.5% GDP.

Stop Coddling the Super Rich. August 2011 This became known as the Buffett Rule. Many high income taxpayers face lower effective tax rates because a significant portion of their income is derived from capital, which is taxed at a lower level than labor. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 217,000 households would be subject to the Buffett rule, with the average tax burden increasing $190,000, a total of approximately $41 billion per year.NPR ‚Äì What Would the Buffett Rule Mean for the Economy? April 11, 2012 Payroll tax revenue and Social Security The Social Security program faces a 75-year average annual shortfall of 1.4% GDP, which is about $280 billion in 2018 dollars. The CBO publishes a report every few years (Social Security Policy Options) which estimates various ways to close that funding gap. Without changes to the law, benefits will be cut by about 25% in 2034, as outlays to beneficiaries will be limited to the payroll tax collections. Until that time, the Social Security Trust Fund provides the legal authority to force the federal government to borrow to cover the shortfall, but the Trust Fund is reduced to the extent this occurs. The many revenue alternatives CBO reported for closing the funding gap and reducing the budget deficit included: *Removing the cap on the payroll tax ($128,700 for 2018) without increasing benefits covers 1.0% GDP of the gap, about 70%. *Raising payroll tax contributions by one percentage point now would cover 0.3% of the gap, about 21%. Alternatively, raising payroll tax contributions by two percentage points over 10 years would cover 0.6% of the gap, about 43%.CBO-Social Security Policy Options-December 2015 Corporate income tax revenue Corporate federal income tax revenues have declined relative to corporate profits. Republicans have argued for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, from a 35% rate to 25%, which would reduce tax revenues by $1 trillion over ten years.Bloomberg ‚Äì Cap of $25,000 on Deductions Would Cover 32% of Tax Cuts The corporate income tax rate of 35% is one of the highest compared to other countries.

November 2005 Corporate tax revenues fell from around $300 billion in 2017 to $200 billion in 2018, a $100 billion or 33% reduction, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, along with other changes. Corporate tax revenues fell from 1.5% GDP in 2017 to 1.0% GDP in 2018, relative to the 1980-2007 average of 1.8%. CBO reported in 2018 that increasing the corporate tax rate by 1 percentage point would increase revenue collections by $100 billion total for the 2019-2028 period. Tax expenditures CBO charts describing amount and distribution of top 10 tax expenditures (i.e., exemptions, deductions, and preferential rates) The term \\"tax expenditures\\" refers to income exemptions or deductions that reduce the tax collections that would be made applying a particular tax rate alone. CBO estimated that in fiscal year 2019, the more than 200 tax expenditures will total more than $1.6 trillion annually, nearly twice the size of the budget deficit. Major tax expenditures include: the exclusion from taxable income for employment-based health insurance; exclusion from taxable income for net pension contributions and earnings (e.g., 401k plans); preferential (lower) rates on capital gains and dividends; deferral of profits earned abroad by certain corporations; and deductions for state and local taxes. The top 1% of income earners received about 20% of the benefit of tax expenditures in 2013 (about $320 billion if projected to 2019), while the next 19% received just over 30% (about $500 billion).CBO Blog-Tax Expenditures-March 17, 2017 Republicans have proposed reducing tax expenditures (i.e., deductions and exemptions) rather than increasing income tax rates. One proposal relates to limiting the amount of income tax deductions that can be claimed. For example, 2012 Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney proposed capping itemized deductions at $25,000, which would add $1.3 trillion to tax revenues over 10 years. Economist Mark Zandi wrote in July 2011 that tax expenditures should be considered a form of government spending. Mark Zandi. \\"How to Cut the Deficit, and What Happens if We Don't\\". Washington Post. July 14, 2011 The Congressional Research Service reported that even though there is more than $1 trillion per year in tax expenditures, it is unlikely that more than $150 billion/year could be cut due to political support for various deductions and exemptions. For example, according to the Tax Policy Center, the home mortgage interest deduction accounted for $75 billion in foregone revenue in 2011 but over 33 million households (roughly one-third) benefited from it. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated in April 2013 that approximately 77% of the benefits from the home mortgage deduction go to those earning over $100,000 per year.CBPP ‚Äì Mortgage Interest Deduction Is Ripe for Reform. April 2013 Value-added tax (VAT) Many nations, but not the US, use a national value-added tax or VAT, which is similar conceptually to a national sales tax. Many economists have advocated for a VAT. For example, William Gale and Benjamin Harris proposed a 5 percent VAT, with a $450 per adult and $200 per child annual refund (which is equivalent to the spending of a family making $26,000). They estimated this would raise about $160 billion a year, or 1 percent of GDP. CBO estimated that a 5 percentage point VAT would collect between $1.9 trillion and $2.9 trillion over the 2019-2028 period, depending on the base of activity to which the tax was applied. Such a tax would be regressive, as it would impact lower income persons relatively more. Wealth tax U.S. household and non-profit net worth was estimated at $108.6 trillion as of Q1 2019. This includes the value of real estate and financial assets, less liabilities.FRED-Household and Nonprofit organizations net worth level-July 21, 2019 The top 1% owned an estimated 40% of this net worth in 2016 (versus 25-30% in the 1980s) or around $40 trillion in 2018.Gabriel Zucman-Global Wealth Inequality-NBER Working Paper 25462-January 2019 Senator Elizabeth Warren supports an \\"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\\" on the 75,000 richest families in the U.S. (those with incomes greater that $50 million) that would result in an estimated $250 billion per year in federal revenue.Leonhardt, David, \\"Capitalism Needs Elizabeth Warren,\\" The New York Times, March 17, 2019 Financial transactions tax More than $1 trillion in stock and bond value is traded daily in U.S. financial markets. CBO estimated in 2018 that a 0.1% tax on the value of securities traded would bring in an estimated $777 billion total over the 2019-2028 period. Spending or outlay proposals Fiscal Year 2012 U.S. Federal Spending ‚Äì Cash or Budget Basis. U.S. spending per person from 1989 to 2013. The \\"Nominal\\" line indicates the actual amount spent per person during that year, while the \\"Real\\" (inflation adjusted) line represents 2013 dollars. Historical perspective Federal spending (outlays) averaged 20.2% GDP from 1980 to 2007, prior to the Great Recession. From 2008-2018, it averaged 21.5% GDP, with automatic stabilizers (e.g., unemployment insurance, food stamps, and disability) rising with unemployment following the Great Recession. For scale, 1% GDP represented about $200 billion in 2018, so this 1.3% GDP gap is about $260 billion more spending per year on average post- crisis. Spending was held flat each year at around $3.5 trillion from 2009-2014, bringing it back down to the pre-crisis historical average by 2014. Since 1969, the highest level of federal outlays was 24.4% GDP in 2009, while the lowest was 17.7% GDP in 2000-2001. Outlays in 2018 were 20.3% GDP or $4.1 trillion. Expenditures are classified as mandatory, with payments required by specific laws to those who qualify, or discretionary, with payment amounts renewed annually as part of the budget process. Defense spending The military budget of the United States during FY 2018 was approximately $622 billion in expenses for the Department of Defense (DoD) or 3.1% GDP. Defense spending has been falling relative to GDP over the past few decades, from 5.6% GDP in the 1980s, to 3.9% in the 1990s, and 3.7% in the 2000s. CBO has reported numerous options for reducing defense spending, many of which deal with canceling development and production of various defense programs: *Reducing the Department of Defense budget by 10% relative to the amount planned for 2022 would save $517 billion total for the 2019-2028 period, while reducing it 5% would save $248 billion. *Limit growth in the Department of Defense Operations & Maintenance appropriation to the rate of inflation would save $81 billion over the 2019-2028 period, while freezing appropriations for five years and then doing so would save $195 billion. *Reducing funding for naval ship construction to historical levels would save $50 billion over the 2019-2028 period. *Deferring development of B-21 bomber would save $32 billion over 10 years. Non-defense discretionary spending Discretionary spending funds the Cabinet Departments and other government agencies. This spending was approximately $566 billion in 2011 or about 4% GDP. This spending has generally ranged between 3.75% GDP and 5.25% GDP since 1971. The spending sequester in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) essentially freezes non- defense discretionary spending in current dollar terms for the 2013‚Äì2022 period, limiting growth to approximately 1.5% per year (about the rate of inflation) versus approximately 6% over the past decade. CBO estimated spending under the sequester from 2012 to 2021 would be $5.4 trillion, versus $5.9 trillion estimated prior to passage of the BCA, an avoidance of about $500 billion in additional spending over a decade. Mandatory programs Historical and projected US Federal Government revenues and spending from 2018 GAO financial report Several government agencies provide budget and debt data and analysis. These include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the U.S. Treasury Department. These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing a series of critical long-term financing challenges. This is because expenditures related to mandatory or \\"entitlement\\" programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are growing considerably faster than the economy overall, as the population grows older. These agencies have indicated that under current law, sometime between 2030 and 2040, mandatory spending (primarily Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt) will exceed tax revenue. In other words, all \\"discretionary\\" spending (e.g., defense, homeland security, law enforcement, education, etc.) will require borrowing and related deficit spending. These agencies have used such language as \\"unsustainable\\" and \\"trainwreck\\" to describe such a future.Congress of the United States, Government Accountability Office (February 13, 2009). \\"The federal government's financial health: a citizen's guide to the 2008 financial report of the United States government\\", pp. 7‚Äì8. United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) [website]. Retrieved February 1, 2011. CBO wrote in November 2012: \\"The aging of the baby-boom generation portends a significant and sustained increase in coming years in the share of the population that will receive benefits from Social Security and Medicare and long-term care services financed through Medicaid. Moreover, per capita spending on health care is likely to continue to grow faster than per capita spending on other goods and services for many years. Without significant changes in the laws governing Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, those factors will boost federal outlays as a percentage of GDP well above the average of the past four decades ‚Äì a conclusion that applies under any plausible assumptions about future trends in demographics, economic conditions, and health care costs.\\" =Medicare= The Medicare Trustees reduced their 2015 long-term forecast for Medicare costs as % GDP, mainly due to a lower rate of healthcare cost increases. CBO reported that the primary long-term deficit and debt risk is driven by healthcare costs. For example, CBO projects that Social Security spending will rise from 5.0% GDP in 2012 to 5.4% GDP in 2022 and 6.2% GDP in 2037 and stabilize around that level.

The estimated annual shortfall averages 3.2% GDP. Over the infinite horizon, these numbers were $56.3 trillion and 3.8% GDP.Medicare Trustees Report. 2012 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as \\"Obamacare,\\" includes cuts of $716 billion in Medicare over a decade, mainly reductions to projected future increases. These cuts would be paid by suppliers of Medicare services such as hospitals, not patients. Proposals to reduce Medicare costs align with proposals to reduce healthcare costs more generally. Many healthcare reform proposals were made during the Obama administration. Topics included obesity, defensive medicine or tort reform, rationing, a shortage of doctors and nurses, intervention vs. hospice, fraud, and use of imaging technology. The Medicare Trustees provide an annual report of the program's finances. The forecasts from 2009 and 2015 differ materially, mainly due to changes in the projected rate of healthcare cost increases, which have moderated considerably. Rather than rising to nearly 12% GDP over the forecast period (through 2080) as forecast in 2009, the 2015 forecast has Medicare costs rising to 6% GDP, comparable to the Social Security program.2015 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medicare Insurance Trust Funds Retrieved July 28, 2015 The long-term budget situation has considerably improved in the 2015 forecast versus the 2009 forecast per the Trustees Report.Paul Krugman.

Abbreviations are explained in the chart page. Source: CBO Report-July 2010. Social Security is facing a long-run shortfall of approximately 1% GDP per year or $155 billion/year in 2012 dollars. Key reform proposals include:CBO-Social Security Policy Options-July 2010 * Removing the cap on the payroll tax. Income over a threshold ($110,100 in 2012) is not subject to the payroll tax, nor are additional benefits paid to those with income above this level. Removing the cap would fund the entire 75-year shortfall. * Raising the retirement age gradually. Raising the full-benefit retirement age to 70 would fund half the 75-year shortfall. * Reducing cost of living adjustments (COLA), which are annual payout increases to keep pace with wages. Reducing each year's COLA by 0.5% versus the current formula would fund half the shortfall over 75 years. * Means testing for wealthier retirees, beyond taxation of benefits which is already arguably a form of means testing. * Raising the payroll tax rate. Raising the rate by one percentage point would cover half the shortfall for 75 years. Raising the rate by two percentage points gradually over 20 years would cover the entire shortfall. One way to measure mandatory program risks is in terms of unfunded liabilities, the amount that would have to be set aside today such that principal and interest would cover program shortfalls (spending over tax revenue dedicated to the program). These are measured over a 75-year period and infinite horizon by the program's Trustees: * The present value of unfunded obligations under Social Security was approximately $8.6 trillion over a 75-year forecast period (2012‚Äì2086). The estimated annual shortfall averages 2.5% of the payroll tax base or 0.9% of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the economy). Measured over the infinite horizon, these figures are $20.5 trillion, 3.9% and 1.3%, respectively.Social Security Trustees Report 2012-Table IV.B6 =Raising eligibility ages for Social Security and Medicare= CBO estimated in January 2012 that raising the full retirement age for Social Security from 67 to 70 would reduce outlays by about 13%. Raising the early retirement age from 62 to 64 has little impact, as those who wait longer to begin receiving benefits get a higher amount. Over the long-term, CBO estimates raising the Social Security retirement age increases the size of the workforce and the size of the economy marginally. Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 would reduce Medicare costs by 5%.CBO ‚Äì Raising the Ages of Eligibility for Social Security and Medicare. January 2012] Raising the retirement ages in one or both programs brings forth a host of questions around fairness, as some professions are harder to sustain for elderly (e.g., manual labor) and the poor do not have as long a life expectancy as the rich.NYT-Paul Krugman-Life, Death and Deficits-November 2012 Interest expense Components of interest on the debt. Budgeted net interest on the public debt was approximately $245 billion in FY2012 (7% of spending). During FY2012, the government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. This accrued interest is added to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore the national debt each year and will be paid to Social Security recipients in the future. However, since it is a non-cash expense it is excluded from the budget deficit calculation. Net interest costs paid on the public debt declined from $203 billion in 2011 to $187 billion in 2012 because of lower interest rates. Should these rates return to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically. During 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to purchase about $45 billion of U.S. treasury securities per month in addition to the $40 billion in mortgage debt it‚Äôs purchasing, effectively absorbing about 90 percent of net new dollar-denominated fixed-income assets. This reduces the supply of bonds available for sale to investors, raising bond prices and lowering interest rates, which helps boost the U.S. economy. During 2012, global demand for U.S. debt was strong and interest rates were near record lows.Bloomberg-Treasury Scarcity to Grow as Fed Buys 90% of New Bonds- November 2012 Public debt owned by foreigners has increased to approximately 50% of the total or approximately $3.4 trillion.United States Department of the Treasury and Federal Reserve Board (January 18, 2011) \\"Major foreign holders of Treasury securities\\" U.S. Department of the Treasury [website]. Retrieved January 22, 2011. As a result, nearly 50% of the interest payments are now leaving the country, which is different from past years when interest was paid to U.S. citizens holding the public debt. Interest expenses are projected to grow dramatically as the U.S. debt increases and interest rates rise from very low levels in 2009 to more typical historical levels. CBO estimates that nearly half of the debt increases over the 2009‚Äì2019 period will be due to interest.Sahadi, Jeanne (December 20, 2009). \\"$4.8 trillion- interest on U.S. debt\\". CNNMoney.com.

Economic proposals In addition to policies regarding revenue and spending, policies that encourage economic growth are the third major way to reduce deficits. Economic growth offers the \\"win-win\\" scenario of higher employment, which increases tax revenue while reducing safety net expenditures for such things as unemployment compensation and food stamps. Other deficit proposals related to spending or revenue tend to take money or benefits from one constituency and give it to others, a \\"win-lose\\" scenario. Democrats typically advocate Keynesian economics, which involves additional government spending during an economic downturn. Republicans typically advocate Supply- side economics, which involves tax cuts and deregulation to encourage the private sector to increase its spending and investment. Economic growth and job creation are affected by globalization, technology change or automation, international competition, education levels, demographics, trade policy, and other factors. Cyclical unemployment is due to variation in the economic cycle and is responsive to stimulus measures, while structural unemployment is unrelated to the economic cycle and is unresponsive to stimulus measures. For example, a general reduction in employment across multiple industries would likely be cyclical, while a skills or geographic mismatch for available jobs would be structural issue. Conservative organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have advocated growth and employment strategies based on a reduction in government regulations; empowering state education systems; teacher pay for performance strategies; training programs better focused on available jobs; creation of a private and public infrastructure bank to finance investments; tax rate reductions for corporations; free trade agreements; and reducing labor union power.U.S. Chamber of Commerce Inflation or negative real interest rates Contrary to popular belief, reducing the debt burden (i.e., lowering the ratio of debt relative to GDP) is almost always accomplished without running budget surpluses. The U.S. has only run surpluses in four of the past 40 years (1998‚Äì2001) but had several periods where the debt to GDP ratio was lowered. This was accomplished by growing GDP (in real terms and via inflation) relatively faster than the increase in debt. Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt.Saint Louis Federal Reserve (2012) \\"5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security, Constant Maturity\\" FRED Economic Data chart from government debt auctions (the x-axis at y=0 represents the inflation rate over the life of the security) Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk.David Wessel (August 8, 2012) \\"When Interest Rates Turn Upside Down\\" Wall Street Journal (full text ) Lawrence Summers, Matthew Yglesias and other economists state that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves creditworthiness.Lawrence Summers (June 3, 2012) \\"Breaking the negative feedback loop\\" ReutersMatthew Yglesias (May 30, 2012) \\"Why Are We Collecting Taxes?\\" Slate In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.Carmen M. Reinhart and M. Belen Sbrancia (March 2011) \\"The Liquidation of Government Debt\\" National Bureau of Economic Research working paper No. 16893William H. Gross (May 2, 2011) \\"The Caine Mutiny (Part 2)\\" PIMCO Investment Outlook Between 1946 and 1974, the US debt-to-GDP ration fell from 121% to 32% even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits.\\"Why the U.S. Government Never, Ever Has to Pay Back All Its Debt\\" The Atlantic, February 1, 2013 Balancing economic growth with deficit reduction Actions can be taken now to encourage economic growth while implementing measures that reduce future deficits. Ben Bernanke wrote in September 2011: \\"...the two goals ‚Äì achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery ‚Äì are not incompatible. Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives.\\"Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The U.S. Economic Outlook- September 2011 Stimulus vs. austerity Comparison of actual U.S. Federal Spending 2008‚Äì2015 versus a trend line based on the 5% average annual increase from 1990‚Äì2008. There is significant debate regarding whether lowering the deficit (i.e., fiscal austerity) is the proper economic policy course when unemployment is elevated and economic growth is slow. Economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson wrote in July 2011: \\"Like many economists, I believe that the immediate crisis facing the United States economy is the jobs deficit, not the budget deficit. The magnitude of the jobs crisis is clearly illustrated by the jobs gap ‚Äì currently around 12.3 million jobs. That is how many jobs the economy must add to return to its peak employment level before the 2008‚Äì09 recession and to absorb the 125,000 people who enter the labor force each month. At the current pace of recovery, the gap will be not closed until 2020 or later.\\" She explained further that job growth between 2000 and 2007 was only half what it had been in the preceding three decades, pointing to several studies by other economists indicating globalization and technology change had highly negative effects on certain sectors of the U.S. workforce and overall wage levels. Economic policies that stimulate demand (e.g., higher government spending or tax cuts) generally increase employment but raise the deficit as well. Strategies that involve short-term stimulus with longer-term austerity are not mutually exclusive. Steps can be taken in the present that will reduce future spending, such as \\"bending the curve\\" on pensions by reducing cost of living adjustments or raising the retirement age for younger members of the population, while at the same time creating short-term spending or tax cut programs to stimulate the economy to create jobs. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011: \\"For the advanced economies, there is an unmistakable need to restore fiscal sustainability through credible consolidation plans. At the same time we know that slamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth and jobs. That may sound contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling the issues that will bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space in the near term for policies that support growth and jobs.\\"The Financial Times-Christine Lagarde Op Ed-Don't Let Fiscal Brakes Stall Global Recovery-August 2011 Paul Krugman wrote in August 2011: \\"What would a real response to our problems involve? First of all, it would involve more, not less, government spending for the time being ‚Äì with mass unemployment and incredibly low borrowing costs, we should be rebuilding our schools, our roads, our water systems and more. It would involve aggressive moves to reduce household debt via mortgage forgiveness and refinancing. And it would involve an all-out effort by the Federal Reserve to get the economy moving, with the deliberate goal of generating higher inflation to help alleviate debt problems.\\"NYT-Krugman-The Hijacked Crisis-August 2011 Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers mentioned the importance of economic growth and job creation as critical to addressing the deficit issue during July 2011. The President's 2012 budget forecasts annual real GDP growth averaging 3.2% from 2011‚Äì2021 (3.7% from 2011‚Äì2016 and 2.6% from 2017‚Äì2021.)OMB-President's 2012 Budget-Table S-13 The change in real GDP was -0.3% in 2008, -3.5% in 2009 and +3.0% in 2010. During 2011, real GDP increased at an annual rate of +0.4% during the first quarter and +1.0% during the second quarter.Bureau of Economic Analysis-Q2 GDP Press Release Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke testified in February 2013 that the Federal government should replace the sequester with smaller spending cuts today and larger cuts in the future, due to concerns the sequester would slow the economy.NYT-Binyamin Appelbaum-Austerity Kills Government Jobs as Cuts to Budgets Loom-February 26, 2013 He reminded lawmakers of the CBO's guidance that recent austerity measures were projected to reduce economic growth by up to 1.5 percentage points in 2013 (relative to what it would have been otherwise), of which 0.6 percentage points related to the sequester. Bernanke stated that the long-run fiscal issues mainly related to an aging population and healthcare costs. He wrote: \\"To address both the near- and longer-term [fiscal] issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, front-loaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near- term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget.\\" Job creation sectors Economist Michael Spence said in August 2011 that over the 1990‚Äì2008 period, job creation was almost entirely in the \\"non-tradable\\" sector, which produces goods and services that must be consumed domestically, like healthcare, and few jobs created in the \\"tradable\\" sector which produces goods that can be sold internationally, like manufacturing. He falsely claimed that job creation in both sectors is necessary and that various factors, such as the housing bubble, hid the lack of job creation in the tradable sector. He stated: \\"We‚Äôre going to have to try to fix the ineffective parts of our educational system...We‚Äôre under-investing in things like infrastructure...we‚Äôve just been living on consumption and we need to live a little bit more on investment, including public-sector investment.\\" He also advocated tax policy changes to encourage hiring of U.S. workers.McKinsey Quarterly-Michael Spence-August 2011 Income inequality Economist Robert Reich wrote in September 2011 that political policies have resulted in relatively stagnant U.S. wages for the middle class since 1979 and record income inequality. Despite more women entering the workforce to provide a second family incomes, U.S. consumption became increasingly debt-financed and unsustainable. He advocated higher taxation on the wealthy, stronger safety nets, strengthening labor unions (which represented less than 8% of the private labor force), Medicare for all, raising the average wages in trading partner countries, and a focus on education.NYT-Robert Reich-The Limping Middle Class-September 2011 Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2012 that moving money from the bottom to the top of the income spectrum through income inequality lowers consumption, and therefore economic growth and job creation. Higher-income individuals consume a smaller proportion of their income than do lower-income individuals; those at the top save 15‚Äì25% of their income, while those at the bottom spend all of their income.Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 85). Norton. Kindle Edition. See also: Karen E. Dynan, Jonathan Skinner, and Stephen P. Zeldes, \\"Do the Rich Save More?,\\" Journal of Political Economy 112, no. 2 (2004): 397‚Äì444. This can reduce the tax revenue the government collects, raising the deficit relative to an economy with more income equality.NYT-Joseph Stiglitz- Inequality is holding back the recovery-January 2013 Reducing fractional reserve lending The International Monetary Fund published a working paper entitled The Chicago Plan Revisited suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank reserve requirements, converting from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (October 21, 2012) \\"IMF's epic plan to conjure away debt and dethrone bankers\\" The TelegraphJaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof (August 2012) \\"The Chicago Plan Revisited\\" International Monetary Fund working paper WP/12/202 Economists at the Paris School of Economics have commented on the plan, stating that it is already the status quo for coinage currency,\\"Debt-Deflation versus the Liquidity Trap: the Dilemma of Nonconventional Monetary Policy\\" CNRS, CES, Paris School of Economics, ESCP-Europe, October 23, 2012 and a Norges Bank economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the finance industry as part of the real economy.\\"Credit and debt in Economic Theory: Which Way forward?\\" ‚ÄúEconomics of Credit and Debt workshop, November 2012 A Centre for Economic Policy Research paper agrees with the conclusion that, \\"no real liability is created by new fiat money creation, and therefore public debt does not rise as a result.\\"\\"The economic crisis: How to stimulate economies without increasing public debt\\" , Centre for Economic Policy Research, August 2012 Specific deficit reduction proposals National Research Council During January 2010, the National Research Council and the National Academy of Public Administration reported a series of strategies to address the problem. They included four scenarios designed to prevent the public debt to GDP ratio from exceeding 60%: Allowing laws already on the books to take effect Three CBO deficit scenarios related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) and the Fiscal Cliff. The blue line (August 2012 baseline) was the \\"current law\\" baseline, with tax increases and spending cuts that would take effect if laws were not changed. The grey line (March 2012 alternative baseline) was the \\"current policy\\" baseline, which represented the avoidance of the tax increases and spending cuts. The orange line (February 2013 baseline) was the post-ATRA result. Discretionary spending for the 2012‚Äì2020 periods, as projected in the CBO's Budget and Economic Outlook publications from January 2010 and February 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (which includes the sequester) is the primary difference. As of November 2014, there was no major legislation scheduled to expire or take effect projected by CBO to have a material net impact on the budget deficit. However, an unusual situation developed in early 2013, referred to as the fiscal cliff, in which the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were scheduled to expire (causing income tax revenues to rise significantly) and spending cuts due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (also known as \\"the sequester\\") were scheduled to begin taking effect. CBO estimated allowing those laws to take effect would have dramatically reduced the deficit over a decade, but also would have slowed the economy and increased unemployment at a time when the economy was recovering from the subprime mortgage crisis. Specifically, allowing laws on the books in 2011 to take effect would have reduced future debts by up to $7.1 trillion over a decade: * $3.3T from letting temporary income and estate tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003, 2009, and 2010 (some of which were known as the Bush tax cuts to expire on schedule at the end of 2012; * $1.2T from implementing the sequester (spending freezes / reductions) in the Budget Control Act of 2011); * $0.8T other temporary tax cut expirations (the ‚Äúextenders‚Äù that Congress has regularly extended on a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù basis) expire on schedule; * $0.3T from letting cuts in Medicare physician reimbursements scheduled under current law (required under the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula enacted in 1997, but which have been postponed since 2003) take effect (i.e., no longer applying the Doc fix); * $0.7T from letting the temporary increase in the exemption amount under the Alternative Minimum Tax expire, thereby returning the exemption to the level in effect in 2001; * $0.9T in lower interest payments on the debt as a result of the deficit reduction achieved from not extending these current policies.Washington Post-EJ Dionne-Why Doing Nothing Yields $7.1 trillion in deficit cuts-November 16, 2011 CBO reported in November 2012: \\"Under the current-law assumptions embodied in CBO‚Äôs baseline projections, the budget deficit would shrink markedly ‚Äì from nearly $1.1 trillion in fiscal year 2012 to about $200 billion in 2022 ‚Äì and debt would decline to 58 percent of GDP in 2022. However, those projections depend heavily on the significant increases in taxes and decreases in spending that are scheduled to take effect at the beginning of January [2013].\\" The fiscal cliff was partially resolved by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 or ATRA, which extended the Bush tax cuts for the bottom 99% of income earners, resulting in considerably less deficit reduction than if they had been allowed to expire at all income levels according to CBO. Further, the sequester was delayed for two months but contributed to moderately lower defense and non-defense discretionary spending in 2013 and beyond versus the 2011 law baseline. Raising income tax rates for the bottom 99% of income earners to their pre-2001 levels would require entirely new legislation. The sequester was implemented, so reversing its impact would also require new legislation. CBO budget options reports CBO publishes a report annually (\\"Options for Reducing the Deficit\\") with an extensive list of policy options and their impact on the deficit. CBO reported in November 2013 that addressing the long-term debt challenge would require reducing future budget deficits. Lawmakers would need to increase revenues further relative to the size of the economy, decrease spending on Social Security or major health care programs relative to current law, cut other federal spending to even lower levels by historical standards, or adopt a combination of these approaches. Republican proposals CBO ‚Äì Federal Spending as %GDP Under Alternative Scenarios and Ryan's Path Rep.

Rep. Ryan provided a response to the CBPP's analysis. The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by Paul Ryan, released a budget resolution in April 2011, titled The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise. The Path focuses on tax reform (lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or loopholes); spending cuts and controls; and redesign of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. It does not propose significant changes to Social Security. The CBO did an analysis of the resolution (a less rigorous evaluation than full scoring of legislation), estimating that the Path would balance the budget by 2030 and reduce the level of debt held by the public to 10% GDP by 2050, vs. 62% in 2010. The Path assumes revenue collection of 19% GDP after 2022, up from the current 15% GDP and closer to the historical average of 18.3% GDP. A grouping of spending categories called \\"Other Mandatory and Defense and Non- Defense Discretionary spending\\" would be reduced from 12% GDP in 2010 to 3.5% by 2050.CBO-Long-Term Analysis of a Budget Proposal by Chairman Ryan-April 5 2011 Economist Paul Krugman called it \\"ridiculous and heartless\\" due to a combination of income tax rate reductions (which he argued mainly benefit the wealthy) and large spending cuts that would affect the poor and middle classes.Paul Krugman-Ludicrous and Cruel-April 7, 2011Paul Krugman-Ryan and Taxes-April 8, 2011 The Republican Party website includes an alternative budget proposal provided to the President in January 2010.

The Commission \\"shall propose recommendations designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. This result is projected to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at an acceptable level once the economy recovers.\\" Unfortunately the Commission was unable to garner the required supermajority of its members in support of its proposals, and disbanded without issuing an official report to Congress.Debt Plan Lacks Supermajority International Business Times, 3 December 2010 The final, failed draft report, which received 11 of the required 14 votes for approval, was released to the public in December 2010. The Commission released a draft of its proposals on November 10, 2010. It included various tax and spend adjustments to bring long-run government tax revenue and spending into line at approximately 21% of GDP. For fiscal year 2009, tax revenues were approximately 15% of GDP and spending was 24% of GDP. The Co-chairs summary of the plan states that it: * Achieves nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020 via 50+ specific ways to cut outdated programs and strengthen competitiveness by making Washington cut and invest, not borrow and spend. * Reduces the deficit to 2.2% of GDP by 2015, exceeding President‚Äôs goal of primary balance (about 3% of GDP). * Reduces tax rates, abolishes the alternative minimum tax, and cuts backdoor spending (e.g., mortgage interest deductions) in the tax code. * Stabilizes debt by 2014 and reduces debt to 60% of GDP by 2024 and 40% by 2037. * Ensures lasting Social Security solvency, prevents projected 22% cuts in 2037, reduces elderly poverty, and distributes burden fairly.Nation Commission-Co-Chairs Report Draft-November 10, 2010 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities evaluated the draft plan, praising that it \\"puts everything on the table\\" but criticizing that it \\"lacks an appropriate balance between program cuts and revenue increases.\\"CBPP-Bowles Simpson Plan Evaluation-November 16, 2010 President Obama's proposals =Budgets and April 2011 proposal= President Obama outlined his strategy for reducing future deficits in April 2011 and explained why this debate is important: \\"...as the Baby Boomers start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to rise, the situation will get even worse.

Every other national priority ‚Äì education, transportation, even our national security ‚Äì will have to be paid for with borrowed money.\\" He warned that interest payments may reach $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade. He outlined core principles of his proposal, which includes investments in key areas while reducing future expenditures. \\"I will not sacrifice the core investments that we need to grow and create jobs. We will invest in medical research. We will invest in clean energy technology. We will invest in new roads and airports and broadband access. We will invest in education.

April 13, 2011 President Obama's actual 2012 budget proposal was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 0‚Äì97 votes.Zero Democrats vote to proceed on Obama budget, fails 0‚Äì97 =September 2011 proposal= President Obama announced a 10-year (2012‚Äì2021) plan in September 2011 called: \\"Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President‚Äôs Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction.\\" The plan included tax increases on the wealthy, along with cuts in future spending on defense and Medicare. Social Security was excluded from the plan. The plan included $3,670 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years, offset by $447 billion in deficit increases (spending and tax cuts) for the proposed American Jobs Act, for a net deficit reduction of $3,222 billion. If the recently passed Budget Control Act of 2011 is included, this adds another $1,180 billion in deficit reduction for a total of $4,403 billion. Plan estimates indicate that if all these measures were implemented, the deficit in 2021 would be 2.3% GDP or $565 billion. Key categories of savings over the 10 years included in the $3,670 billion are: * Mandatory program savings $257B; * Health savings $320B; * Reduction in military spending related to the wars $1,084B; * Tax increases and reform of $1,573B; and * Interest cost avoidance $436B.OMB-President Obama-Living within our Means and Investing in Our Future-September 2011-Table S-1 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities supported the proposal, stating: \\"President Obama proposed a balanced and well-designed package today that would boost economic growth and jobs in the short run while stabilizing federal debt as a share of the economy after 2013. By keeping federal debt held by the public from growing as a share of the economy, the President's proposal would meet the definition of a 'sustainable budget' that economists often use.\\" CBPP-Statement on President Obama's Fiscal Package-September 19, 2011 Congressional Progressive Caucus \\"The People's Budget\\" The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) consists of 75 members of the House of Representatives and one senator. It proposed \\"The People's Budget\\" in April 2011, which includes the following recommendations, which it claims would balance the budget by 2021 while maintaining debt as a % GDP under 65%: * Reversing most of the Bush tax cuts; * Reinstating historical marginal income tax rates of approximately 45% on income earners over $1 million and 49% for earners over $1 billion. * Taxing capital gains and qualified dividends as ordinary income; * Raising the income tax cap ($106,800) on the Social Security payroll tax; * Restoring the estate tax; * Reducing tax subsidies for corporations, particularly in the oil and gas industries; * Ending overseas contingency defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; * Reducing defense spending overall and reducing the U.S. global defense footprint; * Investing in a jobs program; and * Implementing a public option to reduce healthcare costs.CPC ‚Äì The People's Budget.

April 2011 The Economist also discussed it.Economist-The Courageous Progressive Caucus Budget-April 2011 Economist Paul Krugman wrote in April 2011: \\"It‚Äôs worth pointing out that if you want to balance the budget in 10 years, you pretty much must do it largely by cutting defense and raising taxes; you can‚Äôt make huge cuts in the rest of the budget without inflicting extreme pain on millions of Americans.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-The Progressive Budget Alternative-April 2011 Private \\"think-tank\\" proposals The Peter G. Peterson Foundation solicited proposals from six organizations, which included the American Enterprise Institute, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Center for American Progress, the Economic Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network. These proposals were reviewed by a former CBO director and the Tax Policy Institute to provide a common scoring mechanism. The recommendations of each group were reported in May 2011.PGPF- Solutions Summit-May 2011 The Bipartisan Policy Center sponsored a Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by Pete V. Domenici and Alice M. Rivlin. This panel created a report called \\"Restoring America's Future,\\" which was published in November 2010. The plan claimed to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at 60%, with up to $6 trillion in debt reduction over the 2011‚Äì2020 period. Specific plan elements included: * Freeze defense spending for 5 years, after which defense spending would be held to the rate of GDP growth; * Freeze non-defense discretionary spending for 4 years, after which it would be capped at the rate of GDP growth; * Reduce the current six income tax rates to just two (15% and 27%). It would reduce the corporate tax rate to 27% from 35% today. The panel would also eliminate most tax expenditures (roughly $1 trillion per year), with the exception of the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. * Implement a national sales tax or value-added tax (VAT), starting at 3% in 2012 and rising to 6.5% by 2013. * Reform Social Security, by raising the cap on the payroll tax, reducing the annual cost of living adjustment, and reducing benefits for those who retire early.Bipartisan Policy Center ‚Äì Domenici‚ÄìRivlin Debt Reduction Task ForceCNN-Jeanne Sahadi-New Deficit Plan Would Cut $6 trillion-November 2010 Commentary CBO perspective The CBO reported in September 2011 that: \\"Given the aging of the population and rising costs for health care, attaining a sustainable federal budget will require the United States to deviate from the policies of the past 40 years in at least one of the following ways: * Raise federal revenues significantly above their average share of GDP; * Make major changes to the sorts of benefits provided for Americans when they become older; or * Substantially reduce the role of the rest of the federal government relative to the size of the economy.\\"CBO CBO-Presentation to Macroeconomic Advisers- September 2011 During testimony before the Congressional Joint Deficit Reduction Committee in September 2011, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf counseled members of Congress to make decisions about the role of the federal government, then make policy choices to obtain the revenue necessary to fund those roles, to put the U.S. on a sustainable fiscal path.CBO-Confronting the Nation's Fiscal Policy Challenges-September 2011 General strategies In January 2008, then GAO Director David Walker presented a strategy for addressing what he called the federal budget \\"burning platform\\" and \\"unsustainable fiscal policy.\\" This included improved financial reporting to better capture the obligations of the government; public education; improved budgetary and legislative processes, such as \\"pay as you go\\" rules; the restructure of entitlement programs and tax policy; and creation of a bi- partisan fiscal reform commission. He pointed to four types of \\"deficits\\" that make up the problem: budget, trade, savings and leadership. 2010 Budget: Projected Deficits and Debt Increases Then OMB Director Peter Orszag stated in a November 2009 interview: \\"It's very popular to complain about the deficit, but then many of the specific steps that you could take to address it are unpopular. And that is the fundamental challenge that we are facing, and that we need help both from the American public and Congress in addressing.\\" He characterized the budget problem in two parts: a short- to medium-term problem related to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, which has reduced tax revenues significantly and involved large stimulus spending; and a long-term problem primarily driven by increasing healthcare costs per person. He argued that the U.S. cannot return to a sustainable long-term fiscal path by either tax increases or cuts to non-healthcare cost categories alone; the U.S. must confront the rising healthcare costs driving expenditures in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Charlie Rose Show-Peter Orszag Interview-November 3, 2009 Fareed Zakaria said in February 2010: \\"But, in one sense, Washington is delivering to the American people exactly what they seem to want. In poll after poll, we find that the public is generally opposed to any new taxes, but we also discover that the public will immediately punish anyone who proposes spending cuts in any middle class program which are the ones where the money is in the federal budget. Now, there is only one way to square this circle short of magic, and that is to borrow money, and that is what we have done for decades now at the local, state and federal level...So, the next time you accuse Washington of being irresponsible, save some of that blame for yourself and your friends.\\"Zakaria GPS-February 21, 2010 Andrew Sullivan said in March 2010: \\"...the biggest problem in this country is...they're big babies. I mean, people keep saying they don't want any tax increases, but they don't want to have their Medicare cut, they don't want to have their Medicaid [cut] or they don't want to have their Social Security touched an inch. Well, it's about time someone tells them, you can't have it, baby...You have to make a choice. And I fear that‚Äîand I always thought, you see, that that was the Conservative position. The Conservative is the Grinch who says no. And, in some ways, I think this in the long run, looking back in history, was Reagan's greatest bad legacy, which is he tried to tell people you can have it all. We can't have it all.\\"Zakaria GPS-April 4, 2010 Harvard historian Niall Ferguson stated in a November 2009 interview: \\"The United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path. And we know that path ends in one of two ways; you either default on that debt, or you depreciate it away. You inflate it away with your currency effectively.\\" He said the most likely case is that the U.S. would default on its entitlement obligations for Social Security and Medicare first, by reducing the obligations through entitlement reform. He also warned about the risk that foreign investors would demand a higher interest rate to purchase U.S. debt, damaging U.S. growth prospects.Charlie Rose Interview with Niall Ferguson-November 3, 2009 In May 2011, the Wells Fargo Economics Group wrote that: \\"The failure to control spending will result in some combination of higher inflation, higher interest rates, a weaker dollar, weaker economic growth and, hence, a lower standard of living in the United States...\\"Wells Fargo Economics-Raise the Roof: A Perspective on Federal Spending-May 16, 2011 Thomas Friedman wrote in September 2011: \\"But as long as every solution that is hard is off the table, then our slow national decline will remain on the table.\\"Thomas Friedman-NYT-The Whole Truth and Nothing But-September 2011 U.S. media Major American journalists typically assume that cutting the federal deficit is generally the correct policy, according to Ezra Klein. According to Klein, there is an elite consensus on this issue, and the usual journalistic ideal of objectivity in reporting, presenting dispassionately both sides of a major issue of public policy, is not applied to deficit reduction.Washington Post, 20 Feb. 2013 \\"The Problem with Alan Simpson\\" Healthcare cost control Economist Paul Krugman has recommended a series of policy and economic actions to address the budget deficit. He wrote in February 2011: \\"What would a serious approach to our fiscal problems involve? I can summarize it in seven words: health care, health care, health care, revenue...Long-run projections suggest that spending on the major entitlement programs will rise sharply over the decades ahead, but the great bulk of that rise will come from the health insurance programs, not Social Security. So anyone who is really serious about the budget should be focusing mainly on health care...[by] getting behind specific actions to rein in costs.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-Willie Sutton Wept-February 2011 Taxation and spending reforms Economist Nouriel Roubini wrote in May 2010: \\"There are only two solutions to the sovereign debt crisis ‚Äî raise taxes or cut spending ‚Äî but the political gridlock may prevent either from happening...In the US, the average tax burden as a share of GDP is much lower than in other advanced economies. The right adjustment for the US would be to phase in revenue increases gradually over time so that you don't kill the recovery while controlling the growth of government spending.\\"Gulfnews-Nouriel Roubini-U.S. Faces Inflation or Default- May 2010 David Leonhardt wrote in The New York Times in March 2010: \\"For now, political leaders in both parties are still in denial about what the solution will entail. To be fair, so is much of the public. What needs to happen? Spending will need to be cut, and taxes will need to rise. They won‚Äôt need to rise just on households making more than $250,000, as Mr. Obama has suggested. They will probably need to rise on your household, however much you make...A solution that relied only on spending cuts would dismantle some bedrock parts of modern American society...A solution that relied only on taxes would muzzle economic growth.\\"Leonhardt-NYT-The Perils of Pay Less, Get More-March 16, 2010 Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in January 2007: \\"The longer we wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are going to be. I think the right time to start was about 10 years ago.\\"NBC News-Bernanke Warns of Vicious Cycle in Deficits-January 18, 2007 Bernanke wrote in April 2010: \\"Thus, the reality is that the Congress, the Administration, and the American people will have to choose among making modifications to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, restraining federal spending on everything else, accepting higher taxes, or some combination thereof.\\"Ben Bernanke-Speech before the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-April 2010 Journalist Steven Pearlstein advocated in May 2010 a comprehensive series of budgetary reforms. These included: Spending caps on Medicare and Medicaid; gradually raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare; limiting discretionary spending increases to the rate of inflation; and imposing a value-added tax.Washington Post-Steven Pearlstein-Solving the Deficit Problem Requires an Open Mind, Common Sense and Courage-May 2010 Journalist Robert J. Samuelson also recommended a ten-point deficit reduction plan.Washington Post-Robert J. Samuelson-Ten Ways to Fix the Budget-August 2011 Public opinion polls According to a December 2012 Pew Research Center poll, only a few of the frequently discussed deficit reduction ideas have majority support: * 69% support raising the tax rate on income over $250,000. * 54% support limiting deductions taxpayers can claim. * 52% support raising the tax on investment income. * 51% support reducing Medicare payments to high-income seniors. * 51% support reducing Social Security payments to high-income seniors. Fewer than 50% support raising the retirement age for Social Security or Medicare, reducing military defense spending, limiting the mortgage interest deduction, or reducing federal funding for low income persons, education and infrastructure.Pew Center. Only a handful of proposals for reducing the deficit get majority support. December 20, 2015 According to a CBS News/New York Times poll in July 2009, 56% of people were opposed to paying more taxes to reduce the deficit and 53% were also opposed to cutting spending. According to a Pew Research poll in June 2009, there was no single category of spending that a majority of Americans favored cutting. Only cuts in foreign aid (less than 1% of the budget), polled higher than 33%. Economist Bruce Bartlett wrote in December 2009: \\"Nevertheless, I can't really blame members of Congress for lacking the courage or responsibility to get the budget under some semblance of control. All the evidence suggests that they are just doing what voters want them to do, which is nothing.\\"Bartlett-Forbes- Not Another Budget Commission!-December 2010 A Bloomberg/Selzer national poll conducted in December 2009 indicated that more than two-thirds of Americans favored tax increases on the rich (individuals making over $500,000) to help solve the deficit problem. Further, an across-the-board 5% cut in all federal discretionary spending would be supported by 57%; this category is about 30% of federal spending. Only 26% favored tax increases on the middle class and only 23% favored reducing the growth rate in entitlements, such as Social Security.Americans want government to spend for jobs, send bill to rich A Rasmussen Reports survey in February 2010 showed that only 35% of voters correctly believe that the majority of federal spending goes to just defense, Social Security and Medicare. Forty-four percent (44%) say it‚Äôs not true, and 20% are not sure. Rassmussen Reports-February 2010 A January 2010 Rasmussen report showed that overall, 57% would like to see a cut in government spending, 23% favor a freeze, and 12% say the government should increase spending. Republicans and unaffiliated voters overwhelmingly favor spending cuts. Democrats are evenly divided between spending cuts and a spending freeze.Rassmussen Reports-January 28, 2010 According to a Pew Research poll in March 2010, 31% of Republicans would be willing to decrease military spending to bring down the deficit. A majority of Democrats (55%) and 46% of Independents say they would accept cuts in military spending to reduce the deficit.Pew Research-Deficit Concerns Rise, but Solutions are Elusive-March 2010 A National Journal poll in February 2012 reported: \\"When asked to identify the biggest reason the federal government faces large deficits for the coming years, just 3 percent of those surveyed said it was because of 'too much government spending on programs for the elderly'; only 14 percent said the principal reason was 'too much government spending on programs for poor people.' Those explanations were dwarfed by the 24 percent who attributed the deficits primarily to excessive defense spending, and the 46 percent plurality who said their principal cause was that 'wealthy Americans don‚Äôt pay enough in taxes.' While minorities were more likely than whites to pin the blame on the wealthy avoiding taxes, even 43 percent of whites agreed.\\"National Journal- Americans Split on Concern for Very Poor-February 2012 A September 2012 survey by The Economist found those earning over $100,000 annually were twice as likely to name the budget deficit as the most important issue in deciding how they would vote than middle- or lower-income respondents. Among the general public, about 40% say unemployment is the most important issue while 25% say that the budget deficit is.Cha, J.M.

The wingspan is 23‚Äì32 mm. The forewing ground color is variable, but generally with white maculations on a background of reddish brown and often heavily shaded with gray. The hindwings vary from light brown to light gray brown. There are two to three generations per year. The larvae feed on Pinus chiapensis, Pinus douglasiana, Pinus lawsonii, Pinus leiophylla, Pinus maximartinezii, Pinus maximinoi, Pinus michoacana and Pinus oocarpa. They feed inside the conelets and cones. Feeding causes clumps of resin mixed with frass to accumulate on the cone surface. The larval gallery is irregular and goes through the cone axis, seeds and scales. Sometimes the larvae feed on seeds, construct a more or less spiral gallery and do not bore the axis. The larvae have also been recorded feeding in the cankers caused by Cronartium conigenum. Here, they make irregular galleries, pushing out frass that accumulates with silk and resin on the surface of the canker.

N.p., August 16, 2000. Web. Nov 28, 2011. Biography Keeler was born and raised in the flatlands of Oklahoma. He was born into a household of Professors. His father was an English professor at Oklahoma State University where he wrote poems and essays. His mother was a professor of Child Development and Family Relations at Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater. His brother is a professor of economics at University of California Berkeley. At a very young age he was inspired by his family to sing, paint and write, which he believes is the reason he still loves these things today. Entertaining others was something that he derived joy from, which he did often as a child. To him, entertaining others meant to be funny and that's what he did. He would make a joke and get laughs from them which may be the reason why he is a modern day humorist in his writings. He grew up fishing with his father and has fond memories of fishing Long Lake, Minn. and has loved the sport of fishing his entire life. As a kid he wanted to grow up and be a fisherman. He considers fishing more than just a sport, but a way of life. Fishing to him is not about the fish you catch, but the fact that fishing itself is so beautiful and needs to be fun. He loves the mountains and fishing, so when he was teaching in Louisiana and saw a job opening as an English professor at Montana State University, he was eager to jump on the boat. In 1975 he was hired as a temporary Professor of English at MSU where he met his wife, Judy Keeler. After two years, his job was under academic review and this caused him hardship. The reasoning for his close loss of his job was that he was not publishing his works in professional journals. After hiring a lawyer, he got to keep his job at MSU. It was hard for him to make a living on an English professor's paycheck, so during the summer, he would buck bales for some extra money. This inspired him to write satirical songs and poems about the hay fields, which either made the people he worked with in the fields angry or laugh. For a while he was writing poems every day. Some days Keeler can be found writing hysterical poems; while on others, he can be caught painting. Keeler's focus is never on just one thing; he applies his talents equally. His love of writing has gained him honors and awards. In 1998 he received the Charles and Nora L. Wiley Award. This award is given to a faculty member of MSU for their research and creativity.Alexander, Sarah. \\"Keeler delivers MSU Distinguished Professor lecture April 17.\\" Montana State University.

In 1989 district officials told the Houston Chronicle that the reports did not reflect the true pregnancy rate among HISD students. In 1989 Kay On- Going had 158 students. Around 1996, while HISD police officers were assigned to all other HISD middle and high schools, no officers were assigned to Kay On-Going.Houston Independent School District Chapter 12: Safety And Security.\\" Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.

Funds from the 2002 HISD Bond were used to give the campus a $1 million renovation, which included renovated restrooms, a new roof, and additional repairs, to the Kay On-Going building. The renovation was completed shortly before June 2006. In 2006 it had 160 students.Radcliffe, Jennifer. \\"HISD offers plan to save school for pregnant teens.\\" Houston Chronicle.

In the 2005-2006 school year HISD was required to provide free tutoring to low income students at Kay On-Going because, for three consecutive years, Kay On-Going did not meet state academic targets, which were set by the No Child Left Behind federal act. During the school year, 2,912 students at Kay On-Going, Lee High School, and Marshall Middle School qualified for the tutoring. The tutoring, which covered the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS), began on February 4, 2006. On the three campuses, 74 students, 3% of the eligible students, enrolled in the tutoring program. Mercedes Alejandro of the group Parents for Public Schools accused HISD of not effectively communicating that the tutoring was available to the communities at the schools.Radcliffe, Jennifer. \\"Few HISD students sign up for tutors.\\" Houston Chronicle.

The school had around 30 unused classrooms, and HISD administrators argued that the Texas Medical Center location would be of use to pregnant students. Jennifer Radcliffe of the Houston Chronicle said that the proposed plan yielded a \\"mixed\\" reaction in DeBakey parents and students. Some signed a petition asking the district not to merge Kay On-Going into DeBakey. Ultimately HISD did not go forward with the plan. Instead it moved into Kay On-Going into the Carter Career Center in the Fifth Ward. The district also stopped considering Kay On-Going a separate institution; instead test scores of the girls were included with their zoned schools. The change would mean HISD would be no longer required to uphold the free tutoring requirement. The chief of staff for the Houston Federation of Teachers, Helen Wheatley, criticized the decision to dissolve Kay On-Going.

Like many other parasites, the life cycle of S. phrynosoma is complicated and it involves two hosts ‚Äì a lizard (e.g.: the desert horned lizard Phrynosoma platyrhinos or the Texas horned lizard Phrynosoma cornutum) and an ant. The interesting aspect of the life cycle of S. phrynosoma is that the parasitic worm adjusts its life cycle to that of both the ant and the lizard. During the middle of the mating season of the desert horned lizard Phrynosoma platyrhinos, the female worm is already filled with the greatest number of eggs it can contain in itself. At the same time, the number of the ants actively hunting for food reach peak abundance. Also, this is the time when the ant colonies are busy with developing ant larvae. S. phrynosoma takes advantage of these active periods of the two hosts' life cycle and spread their offspring successfully.  Life cycle  The fully developed S. phrynosoma lives inside the stomach of P. platyrhinos and mating occurs there as well. Once filled with mature eggs, the female travels to the lizard's cloaca (butt). Another unique aspect of the life cycle of S. phrynosoma is that it does not just lay eggs that are cast out of the lizard and left alone exposed to other elements. S. phrynosoma cares so much about their offspring that the female devotes herself for the safety of the eggs by casting her body filled with eggs out of the lizard through its feces. Once outside the host, the female worm dies with the eggs inside her. This also helps her eggs reach the next host ‚Äì the ant. The ant finds the dead body filled with eggs and use it to feed its brood of growing larvae. Then the larvae of S. phrynosoma infects the ant larvae, which results in pre-infected worker ant upon maturation. Then the pre-infected worker ants emerge from the colony and are consumed by P. platyrhinos that just came out of hibernation.

It encouraged all of its students to take the test. In 2008 its immigrant students came from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Many students recruited relatives and school-aged coworkers by word of mouth. During that year it had a $1.57 million operating budget. The budget amounted to $6,856 per student. Scarborough High School had a per student cost of $5,442, with 890 students attending the school. By 2015 a day school program was established at Liberty High. In 2016 the Tax day floods caused the campus to have minor issues. Liberty High moved to the campus of Sharpstown International School in Sharpstown, \\\\- despite the \\"former\\" designation, it remained the campus of Sharpstown International due to the effect of Hurricane Harvey on the former campus in 2017. The move is temporary and HISD will later determine the permanent location. Several Liberty students had their own residences flood during Harvey. Demographics the school had about 400 students, with about 28 native languages represented and with virtually all having low English fluency. The student body, almost completely those of recent immigrants, was made up of a majority of those of Central American origin and with others from the continents of Africa and Asia, including those from the Middle East region. The majority lived in Gulfton and Sharpstown in southwest Houston with some from north Houston and southeast Houston. As of September 2015 the school had about 450 students. All of the students were immigrants, and refugees made up about 10% of the student body. In September 2007 the school had almost 200 students. 18 of those students were age 22 through 26. By 2007 Texas state law had changed, funding students up to age 25 (as of September 1 of the school year) to study for a traditional high school diploma; previously the state only paid for students up to age 21 (as of September 1 of the school year), and HISD paid for the education of some students older than 21.

Its former U.S. 59 campus, a leased property, previously served as a restaurant; the restaurant's bar was re-purposed as a cafeteria serving line. Jacob Carpenter of the Houston Chronicle stated that the classrooms were \\"nondescript\\". The center of the lot had a group of trees and picnic tables, while a volleyball net was in its periphery. Andrew Kragie of the Houston Chronicle wrote \\"Other than a front-door sticker telling visitors to register with the front desk, the building's exterior gives little sign that a school operates here.\\" School culture The school has a debate team and participate in school sports activities. At the US 59 campus students used the school's parking lot for pickup soccer. When the school was established, officials believed that the students would be unable to participate in extracurricular programs due to being busy with out-of-school employment and care for family members, but they established extracurricular programs upon discovering student interest.

Premises  The Kalpaka Blvd. 4 was built in 1874 for the mayor of Riga Ludwig Wilhelm Kerkoviuss (1931-1904). The building was constructed by the first Latvian architect Janis Baumanis (1834‚Äì1891). J. Baumanis is the author of almost the third part of all buildings built in Boulevards in the centre of Riga. The first organizations to occupy the building were the City art gallery and Art promotional association back in 1879. It is known that in year 1925 an illegal automobile workshop was located at Kalpaka Blvd. 4. In 1934 different lectures and sessions of the Latvian cancer contain association were organized by Museum of hygiene. Also in the thirties the Health promotion office was located in the building. In 1936 the third floor of the building was rented out to student corporation ‚ÄúImeria‚Äù. The Library moved in 1941 when a decision to transfer the Central library of the Library of the University of Latvia from its previous location in the university‚Äôs main building in Raina Blvd 19 was made. However Library was forced to leave the building in 1942 by the ruling political power. In 1957 the Library retrieved the premises in Kalpaka Blvd. 4 and the Central library of the University of Latvia has been located in Kalpaka Blvd. 4 since then. The libraries of the 11 faculties are located in the buildings of the faculties.Latvijas UniversitƒÅtes Bibliotƒìka laikmetu grie≈æos / sast. MƒÅrƒ´te Saviƒça ; bibliogr. red.

Central library  The Central library of the Library of University of Latvia is multidisciplinary information resources collection, that contains broad collection of publications from Latvia, Scientific Papers from University of Latvia, dissertations from University of Latvia since the early days of the university until nowadays, continued publications in all scientific disciplines, periodicals, fiction etc.  Branch libraries  * Library of Biology * Library of Chemical Sciences * Library of Economics * Library of Education and Psychology * Library of Geography and Earth Sciences * Library of History and Philosophy Sciences * Library of Medicine * Library of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics * Library of the Faculty of Social Sciences * Library of the Humanities * Multidisciplinary Library: Computer Science, Law and Theology  Collection  Collection comprises over 2 million units and is continually expanded. The Library offers books, periodicals, audiovisual materials, unpublished documents, electronic publications and other resources in various fields of science in Latvian and foreign languages. The Library has both open and closed stock facilities with all of the materials available to every user of the Library. There is a wide range of rich and qualitative electronic resources available. Those include e-books, e-journals, databases of reference, juridical information, dissertations and other kind of e-resources. Library provides access to more than 40 subscribed databases with over 100 000 e-resources in different fields of science available at the premises. Faculty and students of the University may access the resources remotely.  Special collections  The Library is proud of several collections of Rare Editions and Manuscripts that include fragments of medieval manuscripts, manuscripts of prominent figures of Latvian culture, reproductions and books from the 13th century up until our day. The Library has received several collections donated by outstanding world scientists: Embriks Strands, Ernests Felsbergs, Pƒìteris ≈†mits, Helmut Winter, Samuels Knohs and others.  Local databases  Access to aggregate information of the results of academic and research activities at the University of Latvia is available via bibliographic databases created at the Library: University of Latvia research publications and history; University of Latvia graduation thesis and a database of dissertations elaborated and defended at the University. Resources may be accessed via the union catalogue online and the card catalogue located at the Central Library.

This is accomplished by the secretion of signaling molecules which trigger a response in nearby bacteria at high enough concentrations. Once the molecule hits a certain concentration it triggers the transcription of certain genes such as virulence factors. It has been discovered that bacteria can not only interact via quorum sensing with members of their own species but that there is a kind of universal molecule that allows them to gather information about other species as well. This universal molecule is called autoinducer 2 or AI-2. AI-2 was first discovered in the light producing system of the bacteria Vibrio harveyi. The pathway that induces Vibrio harveyi luminescence is controlled by two parallel pathways. The first pathway uses a typical AI-1 homoserine lactone signaling molecule. However the bacteria were also found to recognize a second auto inducer AI-2. Scientist also found that V. harveyi luminescence could be induced by 75 other bacterial species AI-2 molecules. This discovery led to the proposal of AI-2 as a universal form of communication between bacteria species. In addition to information about cell densities AI-2 can provide information on the growth phase and prosperity of cells in a population. It has a greater ability to store information than other quorum sensing molecules because its production is tied to cell growth. The production of AI-2 peaks in late log phase for many bacteria. The structure of AI-2 was discovered recently to be a fused 2-member ring with boron bridging the gap between the diesters. The enzyme LuxS is responsible for AI-2 synthesis. The gene encoding for LuxS has been detected in 35 of the 89 bacterial genomes sequenced and in all of the bacteria the gene had little variation. In every bacterium found so far that produces the AI-2 signaling molecule the LuxS gene was also found. There are three enzymes that make DPD (4,5-dihydroxy 2,3 pentanedione) which is the substrate LuxS uses to make AI-2. The pathway for synthesizing AI-2 was found to be identical in V. harveyi, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, V. cholerae, and Enterococcus faecalis providing further evidence that this molecule may be a universal signal among bacteria. Shigella flexneri use AI-2 to mediate virulence. The major virulence factor in Shigella is the plasmid vir B. The AI-2 signaling pathway was shown to be responsible for the observed peak of vir B. Although it was determined that AI-2 is not crucial for virulence that it does increase the expression of the plasmid. AI-2 also regulates the virulence of Enteroinvasive and Enterohemoragic E.coli. It is likely the high concentrations of AI-2 produced by normal gut flora effect the production of AI-2 in Shigella and its subsequent virulence. AI-2 is required for the biofilm formation in P. ginivalis and S. gordonii. S. gordonii is a major cause of dental plaque and its adherence is essential for many other pathogenic bacteria to also adhere to teeth. P. ginivalis causes periodontal disease. If neither bacteria possess a functional copy of the LuxS gene they cannot form a biofilm. However, if either one of the bacteria has the LuxS gene they can form biofilms suggesting again this molecule is used for communication between unrelated species. Other bacterial uses for AI-2 *Clostridium perfringens ‚Äì regulates toxin production *P. luminescence ‚Äì controls the timing of antibiotics *Vibrio cholerae ‚Äì used in the pathogenic cascade Since the LuxS enzyme is not present in eukaryotes it is a good potential target for antibiotics. Also AI-2 signaling seems to control many virulence factors in bacteria so blocking this signal could lead to new ways to control bacterial infections such as cholera. Since the AI-2 molecule seems to be involved in the virulence cascade if we could block the uptake of AI-2 then we could potentially stop the virulence cascade. Fungi also communicate with one another. Quorum-sensing molecules (QSMs) from fungi include farnesol, tyrosol, phenylethanol, and tryptophol. QSMs have been studied in Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, Aspergillus niger, A. nidulans, and Fusarium graminearum. QSMs can include morphogenesis, germination, apotopsis, pathogenicity, and biofilm structures.

Established in 1957, the station's broadcast license is held by Beverly Broadcasting Company, LLC. The station broadcasts a soft adult contemporary format and is known as \\"Alive 96.9, Cleveland's Lite Rock\\", named for its FM translator, W246DG 96.9 FM, which has its transmitter in Cleveland, Tennessee. FM translator In addition to the AM frequency of 1280 kHz, WALI programming is relayed to an FM translator. The FM frequency also provides the listener with high fidelity sound and the ability to listen on the FM band. The FM signal is used as the frequency on the station logo and branding. However, the translator does not cover Dayton. History Early days This station began regular broadcast operations on December 6, 1957 as WDNT, with 1,000 watts of power on a frequency of 1280 kilohertz as a \\"daytimer\\", restricted to broadcasting between sunrise and sunset to limit skywave interference with other stations on the same frequency. WDNT was the first radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to serve Dayton. Launched under the ownership of Norman A. Thomas with the broadcast license held by the Dayton Broadcasting Company, the station's original personnel included general manager Jack S. Pullin, chief engineer Eddie Lane, news director Bill Watts, farm director E.L. Tipps, and women's issues director Lois Massengill. WDNT was an affiliate of the Keystone Network. The station maintained this affiliation through the 1970s and broadcast a full service country music format to Dayton, Tennessee, and surrounding Rhea County. On July 1, 1976, WDNT added FM sister station \\"WNFM\\" (104.9 FM) which aired a middle of the road music format. The FM station is now separately owned and licensed as \\"WALV-FM\\" (105.1 FM). 1980s WDNT owner Norman A. Thomas died in April 1980 at the age of 79. Norman A. Thomas Jr., acting as executor of his father's estate, notified the FCC of the involuntary transfer of control of the license holder from father to son. The FCC approved the transfer on June 6, 1980. In September 1982, WDNT Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to sell the station to Eaton P. Govan III. The FCC approved the deal on November 3, 1982, but formal consummation of the transaction was delayed until May 8, 1986. Govan's turn as station owner was short-lived as in November 1986 he agreed to sell WDNT to the partnership of George R. Johnson and George Lewis Wyatt, doing business as Dayton Broadcasting Company. The FCC approved the sale on December 30, 1986 and the transaction was formally consummated on January 8, 1987. 1990s In December 1990, George Lewis Wyatt transferred his interest in Dayton Broadcasting Company to partner George R. Johnson, leaving Johnson as the sole license holder for WDNT. The FCC approved the transfer on January 8, 1991, and the deal was formally consummated on February 25, 1991. George R. Johnson, doing business as Dayton Broadcasting Company, contracted to sell WDNT and its assets to Walter E. Hooper III in October 1993. After lengthy deliberation, the FCC approved the sale on September 20, 1994, and the transaction was formally consummated on February 7, 1995. 2000s In March 2002, station owner Walter E. Hooper III reached an agreement to sell WDNT to Chattanooga-based Brewer Broadcasting through its J.L. Brewer Broadcasting of Cleveland, LLC, subsidiary. The FCC approved the sale on May 20, 2002, and the formal consummation of the deal took place on July 1, 2002. Because the land where the station's broadcast tower was located was sold to another party in a separate transaction, the station applied to the FCC for a construction permit to relocate their transmitter to a new location nearby in November 2002. The FCC granted the permit on February 19, 2003, with a scheduled expiration date of February 19, 2006. Construction and testing were completed in December 2003 so the station applied for a new broadcast license to cover these changes. The FCC issued the new license on October 17, 2004. After nearly 50 years of continuous operation as \\"WDNT\\", the new owners had the station's call sign changed to \\"WALV\\" on February 2, 2006, as part of a complicated call sign shuffle among Brewer Broadcasting radio stations. The change was very short-lived as the station was reassigned the \\"WDNT\\" call sign by the FCC on February 26, 2006. In December 2007, Brewer Broadcasting agreed to sell WDNT to Whitfield Communications through a subsidiary known as East Tennessee Radio Group III, L.P. The sale was part of a four station deal valued at $1,865,000 for the stations' broadcast licenses plus an additional $835,000 for the real estate including studio buildings, station offices, and the WDNT transmitter tower location for a total price of $2.7 million. The three sister stations in the deal were WBAC (1340 AM, Cleveland, Tennessee); WXQK (970 AM, Spring City, Tennessee); and WAYA (93.9 FM, Spring City, Tennessee). The FCC approved the group sale on January 31, 2008, and the deal was formally consummated on May 30, 2008. At the time of the sale, all three of the AM stations were simulcasting a news/talk radio format from studios in Cleveland, Tennessee. Programming included a local morning show plus syndicated conservative talk hosts including Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. The only time during the week that the stations did not share a program stream was on Sunday mornings when each broadcast a different local church service. While the sale was pending, Whitfield Communications began operating the station group under a local marketing agreement on December 1, 2007. On January 12, 2008, WDNT and its sister stations became part-time affiliates of the Fox Sports Radio network, airing sports programming from midnight to 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. to midnight each weekday plus additional programming on Saturday and Sunday. Sale to Beverly Broadcasting In November 2009, Whitfield Communications spun off the two Rhea County-based AM stations (WDNT and WXQK) to Beverly Broadcasting Company, LLC, for just $27,000. (This is only 1% of the $2.7 million price the four- station group and real estate combo had fetched less than two years earlier.) Beverly Broadcasting Company is owned by the husband-and-wife team of Mike and Sue Beverly, then based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The FCC approved the sale on December 31, 2009, and the deal was formally consummated on January 14, 2010. However, while the Beverlys acquired the radio stations, they did not acquire the land on which the WDNT transmitter and broadcast antenna were located as those were sold to a third party. For this reason, WDNT went dark on November 13, 2009, while the search for a new transmitter site was underway. On December 30, 2009, the FCC granted the station special temporary authority to remain silent until June 28, 2010. WDNT returned to the air with an oldies music format on June 6, 2010, with a temporary facility at the original WDNT broadcast tower site. In June 2011, the station applied to the FCC for a new construction permit for a permanent tower site nearby. The FCC granted the permit on November 16, 2011, with a scheduled expiration date on November 16, 2014. For most of the 2010s, WRHA broadcast an oldies music format similar to, but not always in simulcast with, sister station WDNT (970 AM, Spring City, Tennessee). While the stations were mostly locally programmed and operated, in August 2011 both stations began airing the syndicated radio program The Donny Osmond Show for five hours each weekday. In addition to music programming, WRHA and WDNT would broadcast Rhea County High School football games each fall. Alive 97 On June 17, 2019, WDNT swapped call signs with sister station WRHA. 1280 AM retained the WRHA call letters until changing to WALI on September 25, 2019. Beverly relaunched the station as \\"Alive 97\\" in October 2019. The station promotes itself as \\"Cleveland's Lite Rock\\" and is seeking to court listeners in that city, where the translator is located. The station is branded as \\"Continuous Lite Rock from the 1980s, '90s and more all day, plus Love Songs At Night\\". The name of the station is an homage to WALV-FM, which was formerly located in Cleveland and known as \\"Alive 105\\" at the time.

She has always offered publishing rights for translations of all of her books by herself, without the use of services of literary agents. Biography She came from a family of Don Cossacks. Polina Zherebtsova, Moscow 2011 Polina's father was a lawyer, who died when Polina was a child. Her mother, Elena, worked as a senior goods manager at a large company. She devoted her spare time to her daughter's education. Polina grew in a family that equally revered books like the Torah, the Bible and the Koran. Since childhood, she had studied religion, history, and philosophy. Polina Zherebtsova was born in 1985 in Grozny and lived there for almost twenty years. She considers herself a cosmopolitan as she has multi-national ancestry. Polina's father died when she was very young. Polina's maternal grandfather Zherebtsov Anatoly Pavlovich, with whom she had formed a friendship, worked in Grozny for more than 25 years as a TV journalist-cameraman. Polina's maternal grandmother was a professional artist. Paternal grandfather was an actor and musician. Polina's paternal grandmother was a professional actress. In 1994, Polina started keeping a diary in which she recorded what was happening around her. Her diaries cover her childhood, adolescence and youth that witnessed three Chechen wars. School, first love, quarrels with parents, what is familiar to any teenager, side by side in the life of Polina with the bombing, starvation, devastation and poverty. On October 21, 1999 she was wounded by shrapnel during a missile attack on Grozny Central Market. Since 2002, she has begun to work as a journalist. In 2003‚Äì2004, she studied at the School of Correspondents. In 2004, Chechen diary was completed when the author was 19 years old.

In 2013, she has received a political asylum in Finland. In 2014, \\"Ant in a Glass Jar\\" was published. First Chechen War The first military campaign started in 1994. At the beginning of the war, Zherebtsova's grandfather, Anatoly, was killed by shells from airplanes. Zherebtsova made the first serious entries in her diary at this time. She kept the diary to herself, and wrote about humorous and sad moments in the life of her neighbors and friends. Because of the name of her grandfather's stepfather, Zherebtsov, Polina was subjected to repeated insults at school. Second Chechen War Diary of Polina Zherebtsova In 1999 a new round of war in Grozny began in the North Caucasus, when Polina was 14 years old, which she describes in her diary. While helping her mother trade in the central market in Grozny after high school, Polina was wounded in her leg on October 21, 1999 when the marketplace was shelled, as described in a preliminary report \\"The indiscriminate use of force by federal troops during the armed conflict in Chechnya in September‚ÄìOctober 1999\\". Due to injury and illness Polina and her mother didn't have time to escape from the war. She faced hunger and eviction along with other neighbors in the \\"cleansing\\", as described in pages of the diary. Her main goal was to make people understand the need to avoid war, especially in the same country. The diary also says that before the conflict began in 1994 in the Republic, the relationship between Russian and Chechen peoples was relatively friendly. In February 2000, five months after her injury, 14-year-old Polina was operated on by surgeons of the 9th Moscow hospital, removing the biggest piece of shrapnel of the 16 pieces. She had to change schools five times in the city, as all were destroyed in turn during the war in Chechnya. In 2002, 17-year-old Polina entered ChPGI (Chechen State Pedagogical Institute). In 2004 she graduated from the school of reporters with honors. Since 2003, she had worked as a staff member for the newspaper. In 2005, Polina moved to Stavropol. In Stavropol she transferred to the North Caucasus State Technical University, where she obtained her diploma for General Psychology in 2010. In 2006, Polina was the winner of the international literary contest named after Janusz Korczak in two categories. In the same year, she wrote a letter to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, asking for help with the publication of her diaries. Staff members of Solzhenitsyn's foundation helped Polina move to Moscow, but failed to publish the diaries. Polina continues to publish in the Moscow magazine Banner, the magazine Big City, and the newspaper Free Word. In 2011, Polina published the book The Diary of Polina Zherebtsova, which is about Chechnya. LiveLib.ru LiveLib has included the book \\"Ant in a glass jar.

Publishers highly valued the diary, however, for a long time, one after another, they refused to print it, being \\"loyal to the government of modern Russia.-\\" Alissa de Carbonne, \\"Reuters\\", United Kingdom. Polina Zherebtsova was 14 when the bombs started raining down. They hit the market where she worked with her mother, the streets she walked down daily, until Grozny was reduced to rubble, a hometown no longer recognisable. From the start, Zherebtsova wrote about it, an act of catharsis as much as a document on the second Chechnya war. She filled dozens of diaries in a messy, scribbled cursive, sometimes embellished with doodles ‚Äì bomb blasts that look like flowers, blocks of flats seen from a distance. Miriam Elder, journalist, correspondent of The Guardian The girl born in 1985 in the Soviet Union, sees herself not Russian or Chechen, but a citizen of the world. Her homeland is on the pages of books, written in Russian. But in war-torn Grozny, the word \\"Russian\\" is a stigma. Russians are \\"guilty\\" of everything around, although they themselves are a suffering party. Because of the Russian name girl is beaten by peers at school in each of the five schools that she had a chance to study in. Over the years, Polina learned to fight to defend her dignity. In the book, a lot of the episodes show that courage and perseverance inspire respect, but cowards do not survive. Enemies are always challenging and eyeing for how the victim will behave: break or hold out. In Russia, where the mother and daughter Zherebtsova get at the end of the book, they are considered \\"Chechen women\\", and they are again disenfranchised outcasts. Polina has repeatedly reiterated that she is a person of the world as her lineage intertwined many bloodlines. The concept of \\"personality\\" for her means more than \\"a representative of some nation\\", and ‚Äúcultural identity‚Äù more than ‚Äúnational.\\" Alice Orlova, Miloserdie.ru These sheets from children's notebook are valuable: as evidence of surprising strength of the terrible events of the previous days, as the story of a person that existed inside a history textbook, as a document depicting the ruthless picture by a ruthless eye of a child, as a miraculously survived note of a contemporary. But it is also an extremely talented and thoughtful narration, in which are intertwined stories of growing up, love and death. You can say that this is: \\"a document of the era\\", \\"adventure novel\\",\\"war prose\\", a \\"drama of growing up\\", \\"a love saga\\" ... But all these definitions are not accurate, these pages are about: the value of individual human life above any geopolitical considerations, national differences and global concepts, and the love and the will to live is stronger than a call of blood and explosions of shells. Philip Dzyadko, editor of \\"Big City\\" magazine. The case of the war diaries is exceptional because among confusion in the news, reticence, and many conflicting assessments, just observations of ordinary people, who by the will of fate have become hostages of the war, can give an accurate picture of what is happening. One example of such literature now is the Chechen diary of Polina, the issue of which was a notable event. The book is a real diary that Grozny's resident Polina Zherebtsova kept as a teenager in 1999‚Äì2002, at the height of the second Chechen war. Some fragments of the diary were published earlier (in particular, for those Polina won a literary prize in Jerusalem named after Janusz Korczak in 2006), but to publish the entire book she managed not at once since no publishing house take the responsibility to publish \\"the truth about Chechnya\\". Lydia Chesed, a critic. ‚ÄúLocation ‚Äì the war.‚Äù, magazines.russ.ru This book can be quoted from any place and in any order. And everything will be an endless terror. Perhaps you can rashly decide that reading is the only way to get people to reject war forever. Polina kept Chechen diaries from 1994 to 2004: 10 years of fire, death, hunger, cold, diseases, humiliations, lies, betrayals, sadism ‚Äì all, that together is denoted by four letters: \\"hell.\\" Igor Zotov, www.kultpro.ru Chechen diaries of Polina Zherebtsova are real documents of the era, without any quotes and winks, without the embarrassment for the lack of soft language, which is fully justified by the events that served as material for the diaries. The real document of the era, which also has real artistic value. So it is definitely worth reading. Elena Makeyenko, Siburbia.ru, ‚ÄúDiary as a way to survive‚Äù Diary of Polina Zherebtsova is valuable by the fact that it upsets the balance of the roles and calls for the voices of other characters: girls, women, old women, waiting for the death from young, strong Russian men in military uniforms. Polina called them \\"Germans\\" or \\"white\\" because how can she, born at the turn of the Soviet Union and growing up with the Soviet films, name enemies any different? Russians as \\"Germans\\", shooting in poor or old women or cackling over the girl who skedaddle from them on all fours ‚Äì these paintings are not so easy to accept even for the most liberal and unblinkered consciousness, but it makes the effort of every reader to open \\"Diary\\" even more valuable. Elena Rybakova, the correspondent of \\"Moscow News\\" I read the diaries of Polina Zherebtsova in small portions, they simply cannot be read in bulk. And I am thinking about the following ... It was also very difficult for us to live in the mid-nineties. Well, or so it seemed to us ... Then one side demanded an immediate end to the war and the recognition of independence, while other side ‚Äì fighting to the bitter end. But what about those who have been there, in Chechnya, between the carpet bombing and sweeps from one side and stoned fanatics on the other ‚Äì those were rarely remembered by both sides. People were expendable. Let's not call it the flowering of freedoms and human rights. Yes, we were beginning to travel abroad, to discover the world, to read a free press, to earn money. And beside us, in our country, people lived like that. Do you think this all could pass without consequences? For free? It seems that today a little more is talked about those who are now surviving and dying in the Donbass. A little more. But this will repeat itself over and over, I'm afraid, as long as we as a society, as a nation, as a country do not learn a simple truth: the defenceless people come first and foremost. Andrew S Desnitsky, Russian Bible scholar, translator, essayist and writer. Doctor of Philology. Polina Zherebtsova with her moral stance is much more convincing as a symbol of resistance to the fascist regime than Khodorkovsky and Navalny.

The Skeleton Canyon shootout was a gunfight on August 12, 1896, between members of the High Five Gang and a posse of American lawmen. Following a failed robbery on August 1 of the bank in Nogales, Arizona, the High Fives headed east and split up. The gang's leader, Black Jack Christian, and George Musgrave got away. Three others, including Bob Christian, were engaged by the posse at the entrance of Skeleton Canyon. This gorge in the Peloncillo Mountains had historically been used by smugglers, bandits, and legitimate travelers between the United States and Mexico. The outlaws fought off their pursuers, killing Frank Robson, and escaped into New Mexico Territory. Pursuit continued through the month, as Black Jack and Musgrave surfaced in other areas, as did the other three. Other men joined the posse, and the United States Marshal of New Mexico Territory acquired aid from United States Army forces already in the area for the Apache Campaign in the Peloncillos. The pursuers did not catch up with the bandits for many months.

After working as cowboys in Arizona, on July 20, 1896, the High Fives held up a general store in Separ, New Mexico. They made off with around $200 and some merchandise, trading some of their loot to local ranchers for food and lodging. By August 1, 1896, the High Fives were holed up on the Babocomari grant, in the San Pedro Valley north of Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Together with Ed Roberts, a wealthy rancher and associate of Musgrave, they planned to rob the International Bank of Nogales in Arizona, located near the international border. Roberts was to arrange to withdraw $10,000 in specie and bills, purportedly to pay the unpopular tariff for importing some Mexican cattle. But, Roberts intended to have the High Fives steal the money. A map of Nogales, Arizona, in May of 1898.

On August 6, the clerks in the bank prepared the cash and coins for Robert's large withdrawal, scheduled to take place at 1:00 pm. The bank's president, John Dessart, had the money taken out of the vault and stacked on the counter in preparation. Sometime after 12:00 pm, the High Fives entered town, riding next to the railroad down Morley Avenue and toward the bank. At lunchtime, it was quiet. Black Jack, George Musgrave, and Bob Hayes dismounted and went inside, while Bob Christian and Code Young remained outside to watch the horses. Another source says that Three Fingered Jack was the fifth man in the robbery, rather than Code Young. Inside the bank, the cashier, Major Fred Herrera, sat behind the counter while John Dessart stood at a desk working on balances. Hayes covered the cashier, Black Jack watched Dessart, and Musgrave moved behind the counter with a sack for the loot. Herrera handed stacks of cash over the counter to Dessart, who filled the bag. Musgrave walked to the rear to check it out. Through a double door, he saw four men meeting in the bank's parlor; Morgan R. Wise, a consular agent; W.L. Campbell of Calabasas, Robert Ekey, a Santa Cruz County rancher; and Judge Ed Williams, Ekey's attorney. About then, Major A.O. Brummel entered the bank to join the meeting; Musgrave seized him and moved him toward the back, but this activity distracted Black Jack, and Dessart ran out the front door. Black Jack struck and wounded Dessart in the head with his rifle, but the president reached the exterior, running and calling to Herry Lewis on the street, to telephone the police. Black Jack threatened Lewis with his pistol and prevented him from calling anyone. Distracted, Musgrave and Hayes lost control of the men in the parlor, and the five escaped out the back door of the bank. Major Fred Herrera got his pistol from under the counter and fired it at Hayes. Running through the front door, Hayes bumped into Black Jack. Herrera also shot at Musgrave, hitting him in the knee as he ran out the back. The bandit passed through the hardware store to join his gang in front. As they mounted up, Frank King, a deputy customs inspector, opened fire from across the street, wounding both Musgrave's and Black Jack's horses. Black Jack pulled Musgrave up behind him, and the High Fives took off on four horses, with Musgrave's riderless horse trailing closely. As they passed the Montezuma Hotel, a Treasury Department inspector named Ben E. Hambleton grabbed a rifle and mounted a horse to pursue. Passing the Nogales Electric, Light, Ice and Water Company building, the gang was fired on by two employees. At the end of town, they were fired on by two other Nogales residents. The \\"bullet marks scarred much of downtown Nogales,\\" but the only fatalities were animals: a horse hit by Black Jack and a mule by Major Herrera. Diego Ramirez of Nogales said that the High Fives made off with $40,000; however, Johnny Clarke, the son of a posse member who pursued the outlaws to Skeleton Canyon, said that \\"it was never known if they got away with the money or not.\\" According to the Tanners, the gang did not gain $40,000, or even the $10,000 that was arranged. The newspapers of both Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico reported that \\"not a cent was lost.\\" Just outside town, the outlaws rode east up Beck Canyon, where they split up. Black Jack and Musgrave went to Ed Robert's ranch, located on the upper San Pedro River. Bob Christian, Bob Hayes and Code Young crossed the border into Sonora, near the San Antonio Pass in the Patagonia Mountains. They were pursued by a posse from Nogales, led by Customs Collector Samuel F. Webb, but the lawmen eventually abandoned the pursuit several days later on August 8. From the border town of Lochiel, the posse had traveled fifteen miles into Sonora, but finally had to turn back because they lacked fresh mounts. Posse pursuit and shootout When news of the robbery reached Tucson, Pima County Sheriff Robert N. Leatherwood went to Bisbee, closer to the border, and organized another posse. It included deputies Broderick and Doyle, Deputy US Marshal Al Ezekiels, two customs inspectors, Samuel Webb and Miller; the noted Wells Fargo agent Jeff Milton, and Billy Stiles, then a lawmen but a future bandit. From Bisbee, the posse followed the High Fives' trail to where they split. At the border, Ezekiels went south with a few men, while Leatherwood followed Black Jack's trail with the main posse. While in Mexico, Ezekiels' posse cooperated with the Gendarmer√≠a Fiscal, commanded by General Juan Fenochio. They caught up with Bob Christian, Bob Hayes and Code Young at a place called La Cuerva, but the three got away and back over the border to the US. On the morning of August 11, Sheriff Fly, and deputies Bill Hildreth, Burt Alvord and Will Johnson left Bisbee and headed east across the San Simon Valley to join up with Leatherwood. By that time, Ezekiels' posse had returned from Mexico and was also riding to rejoin Leatherwood. When Ezekiels and his men were near Mulberry Wash in San Simon Valley, Jeff Milton sighted the three bandits and wanted to engage them, but Ezekiels refused to go any further toward Mexico. Milton later recalled: > We saw these fellows and we saw them coming out of the mulberry pasture. I > says Damned if they ain't them, and the fellow in charge [Ezekiels] of them > others they couldn't go. He says 'We'll run them out of the country.' And I > says' that is what we want to do.' But he just quit. That was on the south > end of the Chiricahuas.(sic) After they abandoned the chase, Ezekiels' posse camped overnight in Leslie Canyon, located on the ranch of Si Bryant near the remains of Fort Rucker. On the next morning, Milton, Stiles, a man named Randolph, and Felix Mayhew left Ezekiels; they rode north through Dos Cabezas Canyon to board a train heading to Tucson. There they would get fresh horses and rejoin the pursuit. But, the first phase of pursuit ended the same day, when Leatherwood and his forces reached Skeleton Canyon. Milton later said: \\"I never run on to Black Jack and I'm glad I didn't. I might have got hurt. (sic)\\" Skeleton Canyon is a rugged pass leading through the Peloncillos, which connects the San Simon Valley of Arizona with the Animas Valley of New Mexico. It was a well-known haven for outlaws, who used it as a fortress on more than one occasion. At about 12:00 pm on August 12, Leatherwood's posse was riding across the valley, along Skeleton Creek, when they spotted a lone bandit ahead of them. Deputy Doyle went after the man, but, as he was riding up a steep hill, he fell off his horse, injured his knee, and broke his weapon. Unable to continue, Doyle left the posse to go to Deming. Leatherwood, Fly, Alvord, Hildreth, Johnson, and Inspector Frank Robson stayed on the trail. At about 4:00 pm, Leatherwood and his men were near the entrance of Skeleton Canyon when suddenly \\"shots exploded from the underbrush seventy-five feet in front of the advancing lawmen.\\" Riding near the front, Robson was hit twice in the first volley, both in the head, as Leatherwood and the others jumped off their horses. Robson fell dead instantly as the remaining possemen returned the fire, killing one of the bandits' horses. Under fire, Leatherwood retreated while his horse and those of Alvord and Robson ran off toward the High Fives. One of the outlaws seized Leatherwood's horse, but it was later reported to have been shot and killed during the fight. The High Fives directed their fire at Deputy Hildreth, who was slightly wounded in the neck, and they shot and killed his horse. Jeff Milton later recalled an account he was told of the gunfight: > Bill Hildreth got in behind a tree and they [the High Fives] were shooting > and the bullets would knock the bark off on one side and then the other. And > old Bob [Leatherwood] told me himself, said, 'Milton, did I run? I had one > of these old long barrel rifles and I used it for a jumping stick,' when > they got to shooting at him. Old Bill was the only one left then and was > smoking them [the High Fives]. Do you know, I can't understand how a man can > shoot at a fellow six or seven times and don't kill him. I don't understand. > When old Bill got a chance to run-they [the High Fives] were shooting both > sides of the tree-he got out. He remembered this fellow [Robson] and went > back and got him. Walter C. Hovey, a confidant of the gang, later said that Hildreth had tried to join the gang, which is why they retaliated by trying to kill him when he showed up with the posse. Bisbee Orb commented: \\"Hildreth was acting as a guide for the officers having been driving cattle in that county for years and knows all the water holes and places in the vicinity. The robbers knowing this and being acquainted with Hildreth desired to get rid of him.\\" The gunfight lasted until sundown and by the time it ended, the bandits had reached Robson's body. They stole his rifle, revolver, and watch before mounting up to escape into the Animas Valley. After realizing the High Fives had departed, the posse buried Robson in an unmarked grave and retreated. Aftermath Will \\"Black Jack\\" Christian (1871-1897) The day after the Skeleton Canyon shootout, sheriffs Fly and Leatherwood telegraphed Tombstone: \\"They got two of our horses, we two of theirs. Think we wounded two, not certain, as they were concealed.\\" There is no evidence that any of the three bandits were wounded. On August 14, Burt Alvord returned to Tombstone; he said none of the posse could even see the outlaws during the fighting. He explained they had buried Robson because the terrain was rough, the posse lost three of their horses, and they didn't have a wagon to transport the body. That same day, John Horton Slaughter, the former Cochise County sheriff; Bert Cogswell, William King, and two Mexican men, joined Leatherwood's posse, somewhere around Mulberry Ranch in western San Simon Valley, where they were resting their horses. Immediately after the shootout, gang members Bob Christian, Hayes and Young rode to the Gray Ranch, near Victoria, New Mexico, and robbed the place for supplies. On the following night, the three bandits were spotted in the mountains near the Diamond A Ranch by Tom Horn, the chief of the United States Army Apache Scouts. Since he was riding alone, searching for renegade Apache, he took no action other than reporting the sighting when he returned to Fort Grant on August 28. Meanwhile, Black Jack and Musgrave, who had avoided Skeleton Canyon, were hiding somewhere in San Simon Valley. On the night of the shootout, the two raided a horse ranch belonging to the San Simon Cattle Company. Black Jack robbed the ranch hands, forced them to serve dinner, and took two fresh horses to use. Black Jack and Musgrave showed up at the Mulberry Ranch on August 18, four days after Leatherwood and his posse rested there. They robbed the place and demanded dinner. Some time later, Black Jack and Musgrave came across Robert Hill and Will Pomeroy. Hill was Frank Robson's brother-in-law and was heading to Skeleton Canyon to exhume Robson's body for reburial in Mesa. Saying they were not involved in the skirmish, Black Jack and Musgrave told Hill they liked Robson and expressed sympathy for his widow, offering \\"financial assistance\\". After that, the two outlaws headed for the Mexican border town of La Morita. Another posse tracked them there, but the trail eventually turned back into Arizona and was lost. Although the High Fives had been seen outside the Peloncillo Mountains, Edward L. Hall, the United States Marshal of New Mexico Territory, sent his chief deputy and brother-in-law, Horace W. Loomis, into the area in order to join Leatherwood's posse. On August 24, Loomis telegraphed Hall, saying that the \\"robbers were encamped behind breast-works of a formidable nature and had stood off the deputies [Leatherwoods posse] so successfully that a considerable force of men would be necessary to dislodge them.\\" In response to Loomis' message, Hall telegraphed the Justice Department and requested help from the 7th Cavalry soldiers at Fort Bayard, New Mexico. Engaged in the Apache Campaign to clear the Peloncillos of renegades, the army was willing to assist the roving posses in their hunt for the five bandits. It took months before they had success.

Geography The pass is located in Kern County, California, to the northeast of the current Tejon Pass. It runs at the top of a divide between a point about east of the Rancho Tejon boundary in Tejon Creek Canyon, and Cottonwood Creek Canyon north of the Antelope Valley. It lies at an elevation of , and sits between two peaks of (to the west) and (to the east). History  Old Trails  The ancient native trail which utilized what is now known as the Old Tejon Pass was found and explored in 1772 by Spanish explorer Pedro Fages.Smith, Jedediah S., [Harrison G. Rogers], and George R. Brooks (ed.). The Southwest Expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His Personal Account of the Journey to California, 1826‚Äì1827. Lincoln and London, University of Nebraska Press, [1977] 1989, p134-5. The pass was used in 1776 by missionary explorer, padre Francisco Garc√©s. In 1806, Lt. Francisco Ruiz named it Tejon Pass while on an expedition into the San Joaquin Valley. Ruiz also named Tejon Canyon and Tejon Creek, all referencing the dead badger (or tej√≥n) he had found at the canyon mouth. In early 1827, the first overland American exploratory journey to California, led by Jedediah Smith, used the pass to move northwest from Antelope Valley into San Joaquin Valley, led by Native American guides familiar with the pass. Rancho El Tej√≥n, a large 1843 Mexican land grant in the Tehachapi Mountains, was headquartered below the pass along Tejon Creek. Eventually, a road running straight north (from Elizabeth Lake), across westernmost Antelope Valley, and then over this Tejon Pass evolved. This route to the pass diverted from the El Camino Viejo at Elisabeth Lake, and from 1849 to before 1854 it was the main road connecting the southern part of the state to the trail along the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley to the goldfields to the north. Where Rolls the Kern: a History of Kern County, California; Herbert G. Comfort; Enterprise Press; Moorpark, Ca; 1934; (#255); Chapter IV, \\"The Founding of Fort Tejon; pp. 21-52. \\"Before 1854, the' main line of travel into the valley was straight North from Elizabeth Lake across Antelope Valley, entering the San Joaquin by way of the original Tejon Pass, at the head of Tejon Creek, above the present headquarters of Tejon Rancho. The establishment of the Fort Diverted this general travel to the West almost 29 miles to the present Tejon Pass, then known as Fort Tejon Pass. As the Tejon Creek Pass was abandoned, the name Tejon Pass came to be used solely for the pass leading into Canada de las Uvas.\\" New route established In 1853, the road which used the Old Tejon Pass was surveyed by Robert Stockton Williamson of the U.S. Army for suitability as a rail-bed for the planned transcontinental railroad into California. It was found wanting. The commander of the expedition particularly found the wagon road over the pass to be \\"one of the worst\\" he had ever seen.The Ridge Route: the Long Road to Preservation ; Harrison Irving Scott; California Historian website; www.californiahistorian.com; accessed Nov. 14, 2011. \\"...The name [of today's] Tejon formerly belonged to another pass 15 miles further east. Lieutenant Robert Stockton Williamson of the Pacific Railroad surveyed the area in 1853. His party crossed the Tehachapis by \\"one of the worst roads I ever saw.\\" He much preferred the Grapevine Canyon route, a much better road further west. Williamson scouted it and found it would be far more suitable for rail lines and wagons if the bulk of the traffic henceforth went that way. The name \\"Tejon\\" was transferred west to the \\"Fort Tejon Pass,\\" an integral part of the Stockton ‚Äì Los Angeles Road, which was established through Grapevine Canyon. From then on, the old pass was used less and less; and eventually lost its designation on official maps. Afterward, Fort Tejon was abandoned, and the \\"Fort\\" was eventually dropped from the pass' name, becoming simply, the Tejon Pass as it is known today. References External links * history-map.com.

Administratively the islands depend from the Dawei District of the Taninthayi Division. No tourism is allowed on any of the islands. Geography This 70 km long island chain is located on average around 15 km from the shore.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 India & Bay of Bengal Enroute By National Geospatial- intelligence Agency The total combined area of dry land on the Moscos Islands is 49.19 km2. The islands are uninhabited, but fishermen from nearby coastal locations stay in temporary settlements on certain islands during the dry season. Traditionally these people have been engaging in fishing, timber felling and collection of sea turtle eggs, swiftlet nests and forest products.Moscos Islands Wildlife Sanctuary Ecology Generally all islands are covered in thick forest and they rise steeply from rocky shores. The small steep rocky islets are important as nesting places for the edible-nest swiftlets (Aerodramus fuciphagus). The beaches are breeding grounds for different species of sea turtles. In 1924, during colonial times, the whole archipelago was declared a game preserve and in 1927 a wildlife sanctuary; even then local people went to the islands to collect large numbers of turtle eggs. Presently the whole island group is a protected area, the Moscos Islands Wildlife Sanctuary. Officially there is a limit to the number of eggs and swiftlet nests that are allowed to be collected.Ramsar - Burma Islands There are four distinct groups or clusters of islands in the chain: *North Moscos **Heinze Islands , a group of four islands and one islet named after the Heinze River, the mouth of which is located about 25 km to the NNE. Heinze Bok, the largest island is 3.2 km long and 1.4 km wide. Its highest point is 312 m. **Bok Ye-gan group Bok Ye-gan, round and 2 km in diameter, is the only relatively large island. Its highest point is 359 m. The rest of the cluster are six scattered little islets *Middle Moscos (Maungmagan Islands) Two larger islands and two islets. Sabyat Island is the northernmost; its highest point is 119 m. The largest island, North Island, is 6.8 km long and 3.3 km wide. Its highest point is 312 m. *South Moscos (Launglon Bok Islands) , 6 km long Aek Bok and 10 km long Auk Bok, the main two islands, are aligned in a north- south direction. Hngettaik Kyun is a much smaller 1.5 km long island in between. Auk Bok is the largest island in the Moscos Archipelago.

(1614‚Äì1683) was a Swedish courtier and diplomat. He was a follower of Comenius and proposed a pansophic city, \\"Sophopolis\\". Early life He was the son of Johan Skytte Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon and Maria N√§f (Neaf) and brother of Vendela Skytte. He matriculated at the University of Uppsala, aged 10. In 1629, he, with Schering Rosenhane, accompanied Sir James Spens to court in London, where he was knighted by Charles I of England.Marjory Harper, Emigrant Homecomings: the return movement of emigrants, 1600-2000 (2005), p. 63; Google Books.

Dickson, The Tessera of Antilia: utopian brotherhoods & secret societies in the early seventeenth century (1998), pp. 220‚Äì1; Google Books. In 1631, he visited the Tsardom of Russia.Hans-Joachim Torke, Holm Sundhaussen, Ricarda Vulpius, Russische und ukrainische Geschichte vom 16.-18. Jahrhundert (2001), p. 239; Google Books. After that, he had two periods of study with Gerardus Vossius, to 1634.Dirk van Miert, Humanism in an Age of Science: the Amsterdam Athenaeum in the golden age, 1632-1704 (2009), p. 126 note 49; Google Books. Courtier and diplomat Skytte was appointed chamberlain to Christina, Queen of Sweden in 1633. In 1634‚Äì5, he was attached to Axel Oxenstierna in Magdeburg, on a mission to Cardinal Richelieu in Paris, and in southern Italy., Herbert Jaumann, Handbuch Gelehrtenkultur der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit (2004), p. 613; Google Books. In 1651, he visited Comenius in Hungary; in that year, he was implicated by Arnold Johan Messenius in his confession before his execution.Trevor Henry Aston, Crisis in Europe, 1560-1660: essays from Past and Present (1965), p. 197 note 5; Google Books. In 1651‚Äì2, he travelled from Vienna to Istanbul.

This was an unofficial journey.Colin Imber, Keiko Kiyotaki, Frontiers of Ottoman Studies: state, province, and the West (2005), p. 51; Google Books. While there, he stayed for half a year in the house of a Turk, whose son Yusuf later was a Christian convert under the name of Richard Christophilus in England, as Skytte later testified.Nabil I. Matar, Islam in Britain, 1558-1685 (1998), p. 147; Google Books. In 1655, he became governor of Estonia as the Second Northern War broke out. In 1656, he urged Charles X Gustav of Sweden to make a defensive alliance with Russia, advice that was taken.Michael Roberts, From Oxenstierna to Charles XII: Four Studies (2003), p. 137; Google Books. Projector On a 1659 journey to London as ambassador, he launched a project for Sophopolis; it was taken up by the Hartlib Circle. Skytte was one of the supporters of John Dury in his ecumenical projects; he was also able to meet in London with Robert Boyle, and was introduced to the Gresham College group of virtuosi. His own project was for a residential college.Edward H. Thompson (translator), Christianopolis by Johann Valentin Andreae (1999), p. 302; Google Books. Boyle had already had such a plan, costed at something over ¬£1000, in a letter from John Evelyn in September 1659; Skytte's concept was on a similar scale.Michael Cyril William Hunter, Establishing the New Science: the experience of the early Royal Society (1989), p. 157; Google Books. While nothing came of the plan, one of the precursors of the Royal Society of the English Restoration, Skytte had backing at the time, from Hartlib and his associate John Beale, and Boyle.Allison Coudert, Richard Henry Popkin, Gordon M. Weiner, Leibniz, Mysticism, and Religion (1998), p. 87‚Äì8; Google Books. Hartlib gave a very circumstantial account of the position of the group of virtuosi, meeting regularly both at Gresham College and in William Ball's chambers in the Middle Temple, in a letter of 17 December 1660 to John Worthington; at this point he had not yet met with Skytte to discuss Antilia, a generic name used for pansophic projects.Chetham Society, Remains, Historical & Literary, connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester, vol. 13 (1847), pp. 245‚Äì52; archive.org. Skytte had approached Charles II of England for a grant to support his scheme, but the evolution of the thinking of the virtuosi bypassed his plan, and Hartlib.Richard Foster Jones, Ancients and Moderns: a study of the rise of the scientific movement in seventeenth-century England (1982), pp. 172‚Äì3; Google Books. In 1666, Skytte quarrelled with the Swedish court, and he travelled to see Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. With the help of the physician Nicholas Bonnet, he presented to the Elector a plan for a Brandenburg University, which would have a \\"universal\\" quality.Helmar Schramm, Ludger Schwarte, Jan Lazardzig, Collection, Laboratory, Theater: scenes of knowledge in the 17th century (2005), p. 188; Google Books.

Overambitious, it did not succeed.Ethel Seaton, Literary Relations of England and Scandinavia in the Seventeenth Century (1935), p. 176; Google Books. In 1669, Skytte was at the court of Hanau, where he clashed with Johann Joachim Becher; he acted as patron there for Daniel Neuberger the younger (1621-1680), a sculptor in wax.Pamela H. Smith, The Business of Alchemy: Science and Culture in the Holy Roman Empire, p. 145; Google Books.

Works On his way to Berlin in 1667, Skytte met Gottfried Leibniz, who retained an interest in his ideas and, thirty years later, tried to collect his papers with Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld; Leibniz mentioned Skytte and Georg Stiernhielm in correspondence with Hiob Ludolf in 1687 as aspiring to a harmony of many languages,John T.

Leibniz also commented on the ostracism Skytte had suffered at this period. It is believed that Skytte had an unpublished scheme for a universal language; he worked quite closely with Stiernhielm, and they used the polyglot thesaurus of Hieronymus Megiser.John P. Considine, Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: lexicography and the making of heritage (2008), p. 245 and p. 293; Google Books. Skytte's manuscript Sol praecipuarum linguarum subsolarium, which Leibniz did not track down, remained unpublished. It passed to Johan Ihre and then to the University of Uppsala.

Sylvain Auroux, Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften: Ein internationales Handbuch zur Entwicklung der Sprachforschung von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Gegenwart (2001), p. 1150; Google Books. Skytte and Stiernhielm, Rudbeck and Urban Hj√§rne have been classed as \\"early Swedish illuminists\\" because of their shared interests in a broad area including aspects of alchemy and hermeticism.

The transport code reform has been seen as ground breaking in Europe, heavily deregulating existing transport legalization and on the other hand laying grounds for future transport models such as Mobility as a Service. The legal project will be implemented in three stages, with new road traffic legalization already presented to the parliament in August 2016. Berner has been proposed several means for Finland to meet its environmental and climate commitments set under the UN's Paris Agreement. Berner has stated that Finland would halve the amount of fossil fuel used in transport by 2030. In addition to promote more environmentally friendly propulsion means, such as biofuels and electrical vehicles, Berner has spoken for reducing the total mileage required by the society to produce its services. As a part of the key project and reforms defined in the Finnish Strategic Government Programme, Berner is working on a general deregulation and reduced administrative load in Finland. Another of the key effort Berner is handling calls for growth through digital services, e.g. digitalization, big data and robotization. Berner has also laid several initiatives in these fields, calling for Finland to drive leadership in the development and utilization of new technologies, including 5G networks, autonomous transport and IoT-based solutions.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building. Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word Malkin. Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage. Toponymy The name Malkin has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches were said to be able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house. Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants. Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower, or Mocking Tower. Association with witches On Good Friday, 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history. The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the alleged Pendle witches. On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible. She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft. Both were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women. Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's \\"mentally sub-normal\\" brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches. Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York. Location The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain. It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials. The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the \\"melancholy associations\\" of the place. The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former royal forest that covered a considerable area south and east of Pendle Hill, extending almost to the towns of Burnley, Colne and Padiham. Stansfield Tower, alt=Prominent structure on a hill One contender is in the civil parish of Blacko, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm; since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building. In The Lancashire Witch-Craze, Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn. Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign. The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole. It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the manor of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, described as being \\"in the north of Colne\\", but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial. In 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill. Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version. Another possible location is somewhere near the village of Newchurch in Pendle. Douglas claims there is \\"persuasive\\" evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, Barley and Roughlee. Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood. Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found. A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to Lower Black Moss reservoir near Barley.

Multilocus allozyme genotype data show that Microphallus turgidus is a single outbred species with high levels of gene flow among South Island populations. Microphallus turgidus is commonly found in the abdominal muscles of grass shrimp.  Life cycle  Microphallus turgidus exclusively uses the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum as the first intermediate host, a shrimp as the secondary intermediate host, and the final hosts are typically waterfowl. Embryonated Microphallus turgidus eggs are ingested from sediment and hatch in the snail's gut, penetrate the intestine, and migrate to the gonads and digestive gland. Following successful establishment, the parasite then undergoes asexual reproduction, replacing much of the host's reproductive tissue and digestive gland, which results in complete sterilization of the snail. The first visible parasite developmental stages (blastocercariae) are detectable after approximately 75 days post- exposure and metacercariae are common by 90 days post-exposure at 16 ¬∞C in the lab. The life cycle continues through a secondary intermediate host, such as the glass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, and is completed when the shrimp infected by the metacercariae are consumed by waterfowl or mammals.  Host  Microphallus turgidus are more common in wild animals that live in salt marshes and are considered as definite host. The first intermediate host is the hydrobiid snail, on its immature form called a cercaria, it develops into snail. The most common is the second intermediate hosts, grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio. Metacercariae of the parasite usually encyst in grass shrimp abdominal muscle, and though adult P. pugio average only 2.9 cm in length, a shrimp can be infected with more than 100 parasites.  Symptoms / effects  Numerous reports of changes in the host behavior after the parasitic infection influenced the host-parasite survival, host predation, and parasite transmission. Parasite induced behavior changes include hyperactivity, sluggishness, fatigue, disorientation, altered habitat selection, and reduced predator avoidance. In fact, it is rare are to find a locality where the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio is not infected. At certain shrimp collection sites, near all specimens of P. pugio are infected, some with more than 100 parasites. The intensity of infection varies from one locality to another and may be due, at least partially, to geographic differences in salinity. Heavily infected shrimp are more likely to be eaten by a predator than uninfected shrimp, have lower swimming stamina, and spend more time swimming and less time motionless in the presence of a predator. Thus, M. turgidus may increase the predation of P. pugio in the wild.

He was the third and youngest son of trader Pushpa Sundar Tuladhar and his wife Dhan Maya. Early life Sagar received primary education at a neighbourhood school conducted at the home of teacher Jagat Lal Master. He was married to Lani Devi Bania of Itum Bahal on 12 January 1942. In 1943, he left for Lhasa, Tibet to join his ancestral business house Ghorasyar. Page 81. Career While in Lhasa, he was stirred by the activism in Nepal against the suppression of Nepal Bhasa and imprisonment of writers by the Rana regime. Page 10. He thought of doing something for his mother tongue, and started writing a grammar of the language that would be useful to students. In 1949, he returned to Kathmandu where he completed the manuscript. The grammar, entitled Subodh Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran, was published in 1952. In 1951, Thaunkanhe, the first Nepal Bhasa monthly magazine to be published from Nepal, began publication with Sagar as the deputy editor. Page 81. In a bid to promote publishing in Nepal Bhasa, Sagar formed a partnership with two like-minded former Tibetan traders, Purna Kaji Tamrakar and Ratna Man Singh Tuladhar, and in 1952 established Nepal Press at his home at 11/122 Asan Tyouda Tol, Kathmandu. Their equipment consisted of second-hand Vicobold letterpress machines imported from Kolkata. Sagar was also active in a number of associations. He was a member of Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching), a Buddhist organization founded in 1944 in Sarnath, India by exiled Nepalese monks and dedicated to promoting Theravada Buddhism.

This topic is based on neuroscience and computational neuroscience.Rouat J, Loiselle S, Pichevar R (2007) Towards neurocomputational speech and sound processing. In: Sytylianou Y, Faundez-Zanuy M, Esposito A. Progress in Nonlinear Speech Processing (Springer, Berlin) pp. 58-77. ACMDL  Overview  Neurocomputational models of speech processing are complex. They comprise at least a cognitive part, a motor part and a sensory part. The cognitive or linguistic part of a neurocomputational model of speech processing comprises the neural activation or generation of a phonemic representation on the side of speech production (e.g. neurocomputational and extended version of the Levelt model developed by Ardi Roelofs: WEAVER++WEAVER++ as well as the neural activation or generation of an intention or meaning on the side of speech perception or speech comprehension. The motor part of a neurocomputational model of speech processing starts with a phonemic representation of a speech item, activates a motor plan and ends with the articulation of that particular speech item (see also: articulatory phonetics). The sensory part of a neurocomputational model of speech processing starts with an acoustic signal of a speech item (acoustic speech signal), generates an auditory representation for that signal and activates a phonemic representations for that speech item.  Neurocomputational speech processing topics  Neurocomputational speech processing is speech processing by artificial neural networks. Neural maps, mappings and pathways as described below, are model structures, i.e. important structures within artificial neural networks.  Neural maps  Fig. 1: 2D neuronal map with a local activation pattern. magenta: neuron with highest degree of activation; blue: neurons with no activation An artificial neural network can be separated in three types of neural maps, also called \\"layers\\": # input maps (in the case of speech processing: primary auditory map within the auditory cortex, primary somatosensory map within the somatosensory cortex), # output maps (primary motor map within the primary motor cortex), and # higher level cortical maps (also called \\"hidden layers\\"). The term \\"neural map\\" is favoured here over the term \\"neural layer\\", because a cortial neural map should be modeled as a 2D-map of interconnected neurons (e.g. like a self-organizing map; see also Fig. 1). Thus, each \\"model neuron\\" or \\"artificial neuron\\" within this 2D-map is physiologically represented by a cortical column since the cerebral cortex anatomically exhibits a layered structure.  Neural representations (neural states)  A neural representation within an artificial neural network is a temporarily activated (neural) state within a specific neural map. Each neural state is represented by a specific neural activation pattern. This activation pattern changes during speech processing (e.g. from syllable to syllable). Fig. 2: 2D neuronal map with a distributed activation pattern. Example: \\"neural spectrogram\\" (This auditory neural representation is speculative; see ACT model, below) In the ACT model (see below), it is assumed that an auditory state can be represented by a \\"neural spectrogram\\" (see Fig. 2) within an auditory state map. This auditory state map is assumed to be located in the auditory association cortex (see cerebral cortex). A somatosensory state can be divided in a tactile and proprioceptive state and can be represented by a specific neural activation pattern within the somatosensory state map. This state map is assumed to be located in the somatosensory association cortex (see cerebral cortex, somatosensory system, somatosensory cortex). A motor plan state can be assumed for representing a motor plan, i.e. the planning of speech articulation for a specific syllable or for a longer speech item (e.g. word, short phrase). This state map is assumed to be located in the premotor cortex, while the instantaneous (or lower level) activation of each speech articulator occurs within the primary motor cortex (see motor cortex). The neural representations occurring in the sensory and motor maps (as introduced above) are distributed representations (Hinton et al. 1968Hinton GE, McClelland JL, Rumelhart DE (1968) Distributed representations. In: Rumelhart DE, McClelland JL (eds.). Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition. Volume 1: Foundations (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA)): Each neuron within the sensory or motor map is more or less activated, leading to a specific activation pattern. The neural representation for speech units occurring in the speech sound map (see below: DIVA model) is a punctual or local representation. Each speech item or speech unit is represented here by a specific neuron (model cell, see below).  Neural mappings (synaptic projections)  Fig. 3: Neural mapping between phonetic map (local activation pattern for a specific phonetic state), motor plan state map (distributed activation pattern) and auditory state map (distributed activation pattern) as part of the ACT model. Only neural connections with the winner neuron within the phonetic map are shown A neural mapping connects two cortical neural maps. Neural mappings (in contrast to neural pathways) store training information by adjusting their neural link weights (see artificial neuron, artificial neural networks). Neural mappings are capable of generating or activating a distributed representation (see above) of a sensory or motor state within a sensory or motor map from a punctual or local activation within the other map (see for example the synaptic projection from speech sound map to motor map, to auditory target region map, or to somatosensory target region map in the DIVA model, explained below; or see for example the neural mapping from phonetic map to auditory state map and motor plan state map in the ACT model, explained below and Fig. 3). Neural mapping between two neural maps are compact or dense: Each neuron of one neural map is interconnected with (nearly) each neuron of the other neural map (many-to-many-connection, see artificial neural networks). Because of this density criterion for neural mappings, neural maps which are interconnected by a neural mapping are not far apart from each other.  Neural pathways  In contrast to neural mappings neural pathways can connect neural maps which are far apart (e.g. in different cortical lobes, see cerebral cortex). From the functional or modeling viewpoint, neural pathways mainly forward information without processing this information. A neural pathway in comparison to a neural mapping need much less neural connections. A neural pathway can be modelled by using a one-to-one connection of the neurons of both neural maps (see topographic mapping and see somatotopic arrangement). Example: In the case of two neural maps, each comprising 1,000 model neurons, a neural mapping needs up to 1,000,000 neural connections (many-to-many-connection), while only 1,000 connections are needed in the case of a neural pathway connection. Furthermore, the link weights of the connections within a neural mapping are adjusted during training, while the neural connections in the case of a neural pathway need not to be trained (each connection is maximal exhibitory).  DIVA model  The leading approach in neurocomputational modeling of speech production is the DIVA model developed by Frank H. Guenther and his group at Boston University.DIVA model: a model of speech production, focussing on feedback control processes, developed by Frank H. Guenther and his group at Boston University, MA, USA. The term \\"DIVA\\" refers to \\"Directions Into Velocities of Articulators\\"Guenther, F.H., Ghosh, S.S., and Tourville, J.A. (2006) pdf .

Hulstijn (eds.), Speech Motor Control in Normal and Disordered Speech (pp. 29‚Äì49). Oxford: Oxford University Press The model accounts for a wide range of phonetic and neuroimaging data but - like each neurocomputational model - remains speculative to some extent.  Structure of the model  Fig. 4: Organization of the DIVA model; This figure is an adaptation following Guenther et al. 2006 The organization or structure of the DIVA model is shown in Fig. 4. = Speech sound map: the phonemic representation as a starting point = The speech sound map - assumed to be located in the inferior and posterior portion of Broca's area (left frontal operculum) - represents (phonologically specified) language-specific speech units (sounds, syllables, words, short phrases). Each speech unit (mainly syllables; e.g. the syllable and word \\"palm\\" /pam/, the syllables /pa/, /ta/, /ka/, ...) is represented by a specific model cell within the speech sound map (i.e. punctual neural representations, see above). Each model cell (see artificial neuron) corresponds to a small population of neurons which are located at close range and which fire together. = Feedforward control: activating motor representations = Each neuron (model cell, artificial neuron) within the speech sound map can be activated and subsequently activates a forward motor command towards the motor map, called articulatory velocity and position map. The activated neural representation on the level of that motor map determines the articulation of a speech unit, i.e. controls all articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) during the time interval for producing that speech unit. Forward control also involves subcortical structures like the cerebellum, not modelled in detail here. A speech unit represents an amount of speech items which can be assigned to the same phonemic category. Thus, each speech unit is represented by one specific neuron within the speech sound map, while the realization of a speech unit may exhibit some articulatory and acoustic variability. This phonetic variability is the motivation to define sensory target regions in the DIVA model (see Guenther et al. 1998Guenther, F.H., Hampson, M., and Johnson, D. (1998) A theoretical investigation of reference frames for the planning of speech movements. Psychological Review 105: 611-633). = Articulatory model: generating somatosensory and auditory feedback information = The activation pattern within the motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In order not to overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer is used in order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item. In terms of artificial intelligence the articulatory model can be called plant (i.e. the system, which is controlled by the brain); it represents a part of the embodiement of the neuronal speech processing system. The articulatory model generates sensory output which is the basis for generating feedback information for the DIVA model (see below: feedback control). = Feedback control: sensory target regions, state maps, and error maps = On the one hand the articulatory model generates sensory information, i.e. an auditory state for each speech unit which is neurally represented within the auditory state map (distributed representation), and a somatosensory state for each speech unit which is neurally represented within the somatosensory state map (distributed representation as well). The auditory state map is assumed to be located in the superior temporal cortex while the somatosensory state map is assumed to be located in the inferior parietal cortex. On the other hand, the speech sound map, if activated for a specific speech unit (single neuron activation; punctual activation), activates sensory information by synaptic projections between speech sound map and auditory target region map and between speech sound map and somatosensory target region map. Auditory and somatosensory target regions are assumed to be located in higher-order auditory cortical regions and in higher-order somatosensory cortical regions respectively. These target region sensory activation patterns - which exist for each speech unit - are learned during speech acquisition (by imitation training; see below: learning). Consequently, two types of sensory information are available if a speech unit is activated at the level of the speech sound map: (i) learned sensory target regions (i.e. intended sensory state for a speech unit) and (ii) sensory state activation patterns resulting from a possibly imperfect execution (articulation) of a specific speech unit (i.e. current sensory state, reflecting the current production and articulation of that particular speech unit). Both types of sensory information is projected to sensory error maps, i.e. to an auditory error map which is assumed to be located in the superior temporal cortex (like the auditory state map) and to a somatosensosry error map which is assumed to be located in the inferior parietal cortex (like the somatosensory state map) (see Fig. 4). If the current sensory state deviates from the intended sensory state, both error maps are generating feedback commands which are projected towards the motor map and which are capable to correct the motor activation pattern and subsequently the articulation of a speech unit under production. Thus, in total, the activation pattern of the motor map is not only influenced by a specific feedforward command learned for a speech unit (and generated by the synaptic projection from the speech sound map) but also by a feedback command generated at the level of the sensory error maps (see Fig. 4).  Learning (modeling speech acquisition)  While the structure of a neuroscientific model of speech processing (given in Fig. 4 for the DIVA model) is mainly determined by evolutionary processes, the (language-specific) knowledge as well as the (language-specific) speaking skills are learned and trained during speech acquisition. In the case of the DIVA model it is assumed that the newborn has not available an already structured (language-specific) speech sound map; i.e. no neuron within the speech sound map is related to any speech unit. Rather the organization of the speech sound map as well as the tuning of the projections to the motor map and to the sensory target region maps is learned or trained during speech acquisition. Two important phases of early speech acquisition are modeled in the DIVA approach: Learning by babbling and by imitation. = Babbling = During babbling the synaptic projections between sensory error maps and motor map are tuned. This training is done by generating an amount of semi-random feedforward commands, i.e. the DIVA model \\"babbles\\". Each of these babbling commands leads to the production of an \\"articulatory item\\", also labeled as \\"pre-linguistic (i.e. non language- specific) speech item\\" (i.e. the articulatory model generates an articulatory movement pattern on the basis of the babbling motor command). Subsequently, an acoustic signal is generated. On the basis of the articulatory and acoustic signal, a specific auditory and somatosensory state pattern is activated at the level of the sensory state maps (see Fig. 4) for each (pre-linguistic) speech item. At this point the DIVA model has available the sensory and associated motor activation pattern for different speech items, which enables the model to tune the synaptic projections between sensory error maps and motor map. Thus, during babbling the DIVA model learns feedback commands (i.e. how to produce a proper (feedback) motor command for a specific sensory input). = Imitation = During imitation the DIVA model organizes its speech sound map and tunes the synaptic projections between speech sound map and motor map - i.e. tuning of forward motor commands - as well as the synaptic projections between speech sound map and sensory target regions (see Fig. 4). Imitation training is done by exposing the model to an amount of acoustic speech signals representing realizations of language-specific speech units (e.g. isolated speech sounds, syllables, words, short phrases). The tuning of the synaptic projections between speech sound map and auditory target region map is accomplished by assigning one neuron of the speech sound map to the phonemic representation of that speech item and by associating it with the auditory representation of that speech item, which is activated at the auditory target region map. Auditory regions (i.e. a specification of the auditory variability of a speech unit) occur, because one specific speech unit (i.e. one specific phonemic representation) can be realized by several (slightly) different acoustic (auditory) realizations (for the difference between speech item and speech unit see above: feedforward control) . The tuning of the synaptic projections between speech sound map and motor map (i.e. tuning of forward motor commands) is accomplished with the aid of feedback commands, since the projections between sensory error maps and motor map were already tuned during babbling training (see above). Thus the DIVA model tries to \\"imitate\\" an auditory speech item by attempting to find a proper feedforward motor command. Subsequently, the model compares the resulting sensory output (current sensory state following the articulation of that attempt) with the already learned auditory target region (intended sensory state) for that speech item. Then the model updates the current feedforward motor command by the current feedback motor command generated from the auditory error map of the auditory feedback system. This process may be repeated several times (several attempts). The DIVA model is capable of producing the speech item with a decreasing auditory difference between current and intended auditory state from attempt to attempt. During imitation the DIVA model is also capable of tuning the synaptic projections from speech sound map to somatosensory target region map, since each new imitation attempt produces a new articulation of the speech item and thus produces a somatosensory state pattern which is associated with the phonemic representation of that speech item.  Perturbation experiments  = Real-time perturbation of F1: the influence of auditory feedback = While auditory feedback is most important during speech acquisition, it may be activated less if the model has learned a proper feedforward motor command for each speech unit. But it has been shown that auditory feedback needs to be strongly coactivated in the case of auditory perturbation (e.g. shifting a formant frequency, Tourville et al. 2005).Tourville J, Guenther F, Ghosh S, Reilly K, Bohland J, Nieto-Castanon A (2005) Effects of acoustic and articulatory perturbation on cortical activity during speech production. Poster, 11th annual meeting of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping (Toronto, Canada) This is comparable to the strong influence of visual feedback on reaching movements during visual perturbation (e.g. shifting the location of objects by viewing through a prism). = Unexpected blocking of the jaw: the influence of somatosensory feedback = In a comparable way to auditory feedback, also somatosensory feedback can be strongly coactivated during speech production, e.g. in the case of unexpected blocking of the jaw (Tourville et al. 2005).  ACT model  A further approach in neurocomputational modeling of speech processing is the ACT model developed by Bernd J. Kr√∂ger and his groupACT model: A model of speech production, perception, and acquisition, developed by Bernd J. Kr√∂ger and his group at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The term \\"ACT\\" refers to the term \\"ACTion\\" at RWTH Aachen University, Germany (Kr√∂ger et al. 2014,BJ Kr√∂ger, J Kannampuzha, E Kaufmann (2014) pdf Associative learning and self-organization as basic principles for simulating speech acquisition, speech production, and speech perception. EPJ Nonlinear Biomedical Physics 2 (1), 1-28 Kr√∂ger et al. 2009,Kr√∂ger BJ, Kannampuzha J, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2009) pdf Towards a neurocomputational model of speech production and perception. Speech Communication 51: 793-809 Kr√∂ger et al. 2011Kr√∂ger BJ, Birkholz P, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Towards an articulation-based developmental robotics approach for word processing in face-to-face communication. PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics 2: 82-93. DOI). The ACT model is in accord with the DIVA model in large parts. The ACT model focuses on the \\"action repository\\" (i.e. repository for sensorimotor speaking skills, comparable to the mental syllablary, see Levelt and Wheeldon 1994Levelt, W.J.M., Wheeldon, L. (1994) Do speakers have access to a mental syllabary? Cognition 50, 239‚Äì269), which is not spelled out in detail in the DIVA model. Moreover, the ACT model explicitly introduces a level of motor plans, i.e. a high-level motor description for the production of speech items (see motor goals, motor cortex). The ACT model - like any neurocomputational model - remains speculative to some extent.  Structure  Fig. 5: Organization of the ACT model The organization or structure of the ACT model is given in Fig. 5. For speech production, the ACT model starts with the activation of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In the case of a frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs at the level of the phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2011Kr√∂ger BJ, Miller N, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C. (2011) Defective neural motor speech mappings as a source for apraxia of speech: Evidence from a quantitative neural model of speech processing. In: Lowit A, Kent R (eds.) Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders. (Plural Publishing, San Diego, CA) pp. 325-346). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal. Articulatory and acoustic feedback signals are used for generating somatosensory and auditory feedback information via the sensory preprocessing modules, which is forwarded towards the auditory and somatosensory map. At the level of the sensory-phonetic processing modules, auditory and somatosensory information is stored in short-term memory and the external sensory signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the sensory feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained sensory signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). Auditory and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) sensory signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model). The light green area in Fig. 5 indicates those neural maps and processing modules, which process a syllable as a whole unit (specific processing time window around 100 ms and more). This processing comprises the phonetic map and the directly connected sensory state maps within the sensory-phonetic processing modules and the directly connected motor plan state map, while the primary motor map as well as the (primary) auditory and (primary) somatosensory map process smaller time windows (around 10 ms in the ACT model). Fig. 6: Hypothetical location of brain regions for neural maps of the ACT model The hypothetical cortical location of neural maps within the ACT model is shown in Fig. 6. The hypothetical locations of primary motor and primary sensory maps are given in magenta, the hypothetical locations of motor plan state map and sensory state maps (within sensory- phonetic processing module, comparable to the error maps in DIVA) are given in orange, and the hypothetical locations for the mirrored phonetic map is given in red. Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above). The two mirrored locations of the phonetic map are connected via a neural pathway (see above), leading to a (simple) one-to-one mirroring of the current activation pattern for both realizations of the phonetic map. This neural pathway between the two locations of the phonetic map is assumed to be a part of the fasciculus arcuatus (AF, see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). For speech perception, the model starts with an external acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an external speaker). This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, and leads to an activation pattern for each syllable or word on the level of the auditory- phonetic processing module (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007Hickok G, Poeppel D (2007) Towards a functional neuroanatomy of speech perception. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 4, 131‚Äì138) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus may lead to a coactivation of motor representations for that speech item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.). = Action repository = self-organizing phonetic map. Each of the three link weight representations refers to the same section within the phonetic map and thus refers to the same 10√ó10 neurons The phonetic map together with the motor plan state map, sensory state maps (occurring within the sensory-phonetic processing modules), and phonemic (state) map form the action repository. The phonetic map is implemented in ACT as a self-organizing neural map and different speech items are represented by different neurons within this map (punctual or local representation, see above: neural representations). The phonetic map exhibits three major characteristics: * More than one phonetic realization may occur within the phonetic map for one phonemic state (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7: e.g. the syllable /de:m/ is represented by three neurons within the phonetic map) * Phonetotopy: The phonetic map exhibits an ordering of speech items with respect to different phonetic features (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7. Three examples: (i) the syllables /p@/, /t@/, and /k@/ occur in an upward ordering at the left side within the phonetic map; (ii) syllable-initial plosives occur in the upper left part of the phonetic map while syllable initial fricatives occur in the lower right half; (iii) CV syllables and CVC syllables as well occur in different areas of the phonetic map.). * The phonetic map is hypermodal or multimodal: The activation of a phonetic item at the level of the phonetic map coactivates (i) a phonemic state (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7), (ii) a motor plan state (see motor plan link weights in Fig. 7), (iii) an auditory state (see auditory link weights in Fig. 7), and (iv) a somatosensory state (not shown in Fig. 7). All these states are learned or trained during speech acquisition by tuning the synaptic link weights between each neuron within the phonetic map, representing a particular phonetic state and all neurons within the associated motor plan and sensory state maps (see also Fig. 3). The phonetic map implements the action- perception-link within the ACT model (see also Fig. 5 and Fig. 6: the dual neural representation of the phonetic map in the frontal lobe and at the intersection of temporal lobe and parietal lobe). = Motor plans = A motor plan is a high level motor description for the production and articulation of a speech items (see motor goals, motor skills, articulatory phonetics, articulatory phonology). In our neurocomputational model ACT a motor plan is quantified as a vocal tract action score. Vocal tract action scores quantitatively determine the number of vocal tract actions (also called articulatory gestures), which need to be activated in order to produce a speech item, their degree of realization and duration, and the temporal organization of all vocal tract actions building up a speech item (for a detailed description of vocal tract actions scores see e.g. Kr√∂ger & Birkholz 2007).Kr√∂ger BJ, Birkholz P (2007) A gesture-based concept for speech movement control in articulatory speech synthesis. In: Esposito A, Faundez-Zanuy M, Keller E, Marinaro M (eds.) Verbal and Nonverbal Communication Behaviours, LNAI 4775 (Springer Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg) pp. 174-189 The detailed realization of each vocal tract action (articulatory gesture) depends on the temporal organization of all vocal tract actions building up a speech item and especially on their temporal overlap. Thus the detailed realization of each vocal tract action within an speech item is specified below the motor plan level in our neurocomputational model ACT (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2011).Kr√∂ger BJ, Birkholz P, Kannampuzha J, Eckers C, Kaufmann E, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Neurobiological interpretation of a quantitative target approximation model for speech actions. In: Kr√∂ger BJ, Birkholz P (eds.) Studientexte zur Sprachkommunikation: Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung 2011 (TUDpress, Dresden, Germany), pp. 184-194  Integrating sensorimotor and cognitive aspects: the coupling of action repository and mental lexicon  A severe problem of phonetic or sensorimotor models of speech processing (like DIVA or ACT) is that the development of the phonemic map during speech acquisition is not modeled. A possible solution of this problem could be a direct coupling of action repository and mental lexicon without explicitly introducing a phonemic map at the beginning of speech acquisition (even at the beginning of imitation training; see Kr√∂ger et al. 2011 PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics).  Experiments: speech acquisition  A very important issue for all neuroscientific or neurocomputational approaches is to separate structure and knowledge. While the structure of the model (i.e. of the human neuronal network, which is needed for processing speech) is mainly determined by evolutionary processes, the knowledge is gathered mainly during speech acquisition by processes of learning. Different learning experiments were carried out with the model ACT in order to learn (i) a five-vowel system /i, e, a, o, u/ (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2009), (ii) a small consonant system (voiced plosives /b, d, g/ in combination with all five vowels acquired earlier as CV syllables (ibid.), (iii) a small model language comprising the five-vowel system, voiced and unvoiced plosives /b, d, g, p, t, k/, nasals /m, n/ and the lateral /l/ and three syllable types (V, CV, and CCV) (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2011)Kr√∂ger BJ, Miller N, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C. (2011) Defective neural motor speech mappings as a source for apraxia of speech: Evidence from a quantitative neural model of speech processing. In: Lowit A, Kent R (eds.) Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders. (Plural Publishing, San Diego, CA) pp. 325-346 and (iv) the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German for a 6-year-old child (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2011).Kr√∂ger BJ, Birkholz P, Kannampuzha J, Kaufmann E, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2011) Towards the acquisition of a sensorimotor vocal tract action repository within a neural model of speech processing. In: Esposito A, Vinciarelli A, Vicsi K, Pelachaud C, Nijholt A (eds.) Analysis of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication and Enactment: The Processing Issues. LNCS 6800 (Springer, Berlin), pp. 287-293 In all cases, an ordering of phonetic items with respect to different phonetic features can be observed.  Experiments: speech perception  Despite the fact that the ACT model in its earlier versions was designed as a pure speech production model (including speech acquisition), the model is capable of exhibiting important basic phenomena of speech perception, i.e. categorical perception and the McGurk effect. In the case of categorical perception, the model is able to exhibit that categorical perception is stronger in the case of plosives than in the case of vowels (see Kr√∂ger et al. 2009). Furthermore, the model ACT was able to exhibit the McGurk effect, if a specific mechanism of inhibition of neurons of the level of the phonetic map was implemented (see Kr√∂ger and Kannampuzha 2008).Kr√∂ger BJ, Kannampuzha J (2008) A neurofunctional model of speech production including aspects of auditory and audio-visual speech perception.

Gayakwad is an Indian Paralympic swimmer from Bangalore. At the 2014 Asian Games, he broke P.T. Usha's record for most number of medals by an Indian at any multi-discipline event by winning 6 medals. Coming from a modest financial background, he has over 30 international and 40 national medals to his credit, one of them being the bronze medal at the 2010 Asian Para Games. He is the first Indian swimmer to qualify for the Paralympics and competed in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Early years Sharath was born in Bangalore, India in 1991 with a deformed left hand. He attended the Little Flower Public School in Bangalore, where his parents were initially apprehensive of sending him to mandatory swimming classes because of his disability. However, he eventually took up swimming classes at the age of 9 along with the rest of the class. Soon after that, he was to be seen participating in various swimming events for the disabled. In 2003, trainer John Christopher spotted him swimming at a school event, and ended up training Sharath for 7 years. Christopher explains that Sharath was the first paralympic swimmer he had coached, and that Sharath had to work a lot on maintaining equilibrium, because of his deformity. He attended Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College for high school studies, where he was given a fee concession and given encouragement for training. Career 2008 Sharath Gayakwad has represented India at various national and international swimming events. He won four Gold, two Silver and two Bronze at the IWAS World Games, 2008. 2010 He won a Bronze medal clocking one minute and 20.90 seconds at the 2010 Asian Para Games, Guangzhou, China. The performance also enabled Sharath to qualify for the Paralympics scheduled to be held in London in 2012. He was ranked No. 13 in the world in his category in 100m Breaststroke event in this year. 2012 He is the first Indian swimmer to achieve the qualifying time for London Paralympics, 2012.

It was called Lindau Stadt (town) until 15 May 1936. It is the largest railway station in Lindau and its only long-distance traffic stop. In the urban area there is also Lindau-Aeschach station and Lindau-Reutin freight yard. Formerly there were also Lindau-Siebertsdorf (called Lindau-Zech until 15 May 1936), Lindau Langenweg, Lindau Strandbad, Schoenau, Oberreitnau and Rehlings. Location Lindau Hauptbahnhof is a railway terminus and lies on the island of Lindau in the immediate vicinity of Lindau harbour. The current station building, which is protected as a monument, was built between 1913 and 1921 in the Art Nouveau style. The station is about 500 metres long and is connected by a four-track line running over an embankment to the mainland. The embankment and the parallel Seebr√ºcke road bridge, which is about 500 metres to the east, form the perimeter of the so-called Kleinen See (small lake), which lies between the suburb of Aeschach and the island. On the west side of the station there is a small marshalling yard and the former depot. Meanwhile, some workshops in the rear are still used for vehicle maintenance. The railway lines separate the districts of Hauptinsel (main island) from the Hinteren Insel (rear island). However, a pedestrian bridge and the Thiersch road bridge run above the tracks. As part of the Lindau 21 project, it is proposed that the terminal station be replaced by a through station on the mainland at Lindau-Reutin to simplify operations.  History  Lindau is the terminus of the Allg√§u Railway, running from Munich via Kempten. Its southeastern section from Oberstaufen to Lindau was completed on 1 September 1853. From 1869 to 1939 there was a ferry port for the carriage of freight wagons to Romanshorn and from 1873 to 1899 to Konstanz. In 1899, the Bodenseeg√ºrtel Railway was opened from Radolfzell via Friedrichshafen. The Vorarlberg Railway runs from Lindau via Bregenz, Dornbirn and Feldkirch to Bludenz and is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). As a result, Lindau is also a border station. Formerly the √ñBB had its own ticket office in Lindau station; this was replaced by ticket machines, which still exist. The route to Bludenz was electrified on 14 December 1954 and is still the only electrified line to Lindau. In Lindau station, tracks 1 to 3 are electrified. Even Swiss Federal Railways electric locomotives are scheduled to run to Lindau.  Operations  The departure board in 2005  Long-distance passenger services  EuroCity line 88 (DB-designation) provides regular connections from Munich via Lindau to Zurich. In addition, a single pair of Intercity services run on German line 32 from M√ºnster via Lindau to Innsbruck. EuroCity and Intercity trains change traction between electric and diesel locomotives in Lindau. Formerly, Express trains of the √ñBB ran from Lindau, including direct links to Vienna. Today Austrian long-distance trains mostly start in nearby Bregenz. Since December 2010, a daily service operated with Railjet rollingstock has run from Lindau. Initially it runs as a Regional-Express service to Bregenz with a stop in Lochau-H√∂rbranz. It runs as a Railjet service from Bregenz to Vienna.  Regional services  Regional services are operated from Lindau station by three companies in three different directions. DB Regio Allg√§u-Schwaben runs towards Bavaria, DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee runs towards Baden- Wurttemberg and √ñBB runs towards Austria. Interregio-Express (IRE) trains run every two hours to and from Friedrichshafen bound for Ulm or Stuttgart. These are supplemented by hourly Regionalbahn (RB) services which operate to and from Friedrichshafen. Circulating to and from Hergatz among others are Arriva- L√§nderbahn-Express (ALEX, now operated by Netinera) services to and from Munich and the Allg√§u-Franken-Express (a Regional-Express) to and from Nuremberg. Additionally a Regionalbahn service operates to and from Augsburg as well as individual Regional-Express services to and from Ulm via Kempten. The √ñBB operates Regional (R) and Regional-Express (REX) services to Bludenz or St. Margrethen in Switzerland.  City buses  Bus routes 1 and 2 of Stadtbus Lindau operate from the station forecourt to all part of the city of Lindau.

Michelin Tourist Guide Germany (1st ed.) Clermont-Ferrand: Michelin, p. 468. . () is an architectural style that is especially characteristic of spas and seaside resorts on the German Baltic coast. The style evolved since the foundation of Heiligendamm in 1793, and flourished especially around the year 1870, when resorts were connected to big cities via railway lines. Until today, many buildings on the German coasts are built in the style or feature distinct elements of resort architecture. Single free-standing mansions featuring resort architecture are called B√§dervilla (plural B√§dervillen), translating as Resort Mansion or Spa Villa.Binz: Pforten der B√§dervillen stehen offen The architecture of inland health spas in Central Europe (i.e. those away from the coast), in Thuringia, the Czech Republic or Switzerland for instance, is generally referred to as spa architecture (Kurarchitektur).  History  The architectural style of resort architecture was initially developed since the foundation of Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg in 1793, the first continental European seaside resort, as a style mixture that should appeal to the upper class, like the aristocracy and businessmen of Europe. The style especially received a boost with the railway lines connecting the then booming seaside resorts of Germany to European metropolitan areas in the late 19th and early 20th century. It can be a variation of several styles with new elements, including historicism and Art Nouveau, for instance. It is often characterised by two to four storey buildings whose fa√ßades are often decorated with balconies, gables and verandas. In larger villas there are occasionally central avants-corps. Arched or rectangular windows predominate, occasionally flanked by half-columns or blind pilasters. Triangular gables and occasionally also curved gables or small turrets close off the ends of the attics. What is special about this form of architecture is its basic composition in classical styles that are very freely combined and which may be mixed with art nouveau ornamentation, for instance on the capitals. The most common colour is white, which is why the health spas are occasionally described as \\"white pearls\\". As a result, the rare examples in colour, for example, painted in Bordeaux red, olive green, beige or blue, set amongst their white counterparts, are very striking. Overall the buildings appear rather delicate and are often built of wood with a core of stone. Among the best-known examples today are those found on the Baltic coast on the island of R√ºgen, for instance in Sellin, Binz or G√∂hren. Heiligendamm near Bad Doberan is the oldest German seaside spa; numerous buildings from the early spa era can be found there. Entire ensembles in white with occasionally coloured buildings are found in the parish of Heringsdorf on the island of Usedom. As well as in K√ºhlungsborn. One of the oldest buildings featuring the resort style was built by Georg Bernhard von B√ºlow in 1845 in Heringsdorf, Villa Achterkerke. One of the art-historically most important buildings (due to its glass mosaic), is the Villa Oechsler in Heringsdorf, built in 1883 by Antonio Salviati. The Wolgaster Holzbau company was internationally known for their chalet-inspired resort architecture wooden mansions. They were the first in the world to build prefabricated houses in the 19th century, in places such as Ahlbeck, Bansin, Binz and Heringsdorf.

It is in length and has a drainage area of .  Geography  Under the Japan Rivers Act of 1906 the Y≈çr≈ç is designated as a Class 1 River. The Kurobe originates in Katori and Asahi in Chiba Prefecture. The river flows through Katori before it empties into the Tone River at a sluice gate in the T≈çwada District of T≈çnosh≈ç, Chiba. The Kurobegawa Reservoir was built to protect the river from salinity and flooding. The Kurobe provides drinking water and water for agricultural purposes along the length of the river.

Tributaries of the Kurobe  *Kiyomizu River *Kobori River *Tama River *Takenuma River  Environmental conditions   Pollution conditions  The Kurobe River sits on relatively low-lying land, so the current of the river is slow, and water pollution is a problem. The cultivation of river plant species has been considered as a remedy to water pollution on the Kurobe. Grass carp are found along the length of the river, and cause extensive damage to existing reed species.ÂçÉËëâÁúå ÈªíÈÉ®Â∑ù  Fish species  Numerous species of fish are found in the Kurobe River, including: *Common carp *Silver carp *Carassius carp *Black bass *Japanese eel In 2010 a significant fish kill of large-bodied fish occurred in the Kurobe.

Illuminated lanterns on the Kurobe River  History   Edo period  Kurobe was an active center of inland shipping. Tokugawa Ieyasu diverted the course of the Tone River to the east in 1654 to prevent flooding in Edo and exploit trade between agricultural areas along the Tone River, Ch≈çshi and the Kuj≈´kuri coast and the capitol Edo, now modern-day Tokyo. The Kurobe thus became a main trade route between the Tone and Edo in the Ed period. Numerous riverboats primarily transported rice through the region at this time. Merchants came to occupy both banks of the Kurobe, small piers were built along the length of the river to load goods from the surrounding villages of the Tone River region. Flatboats became the common mode of transport on the Kurobe.  Meiji period  At the beginning of the Meiji period the brewing industry grew in importance in the Tone River region. Merchants in the Kurobe River area prospered as alcoholic beverages and soy sauce were transported along the Kurobe, as were products from the sericulture industry. The scenery of Kurobe was compared in this period to that in Venice because of the extensive use of flatboats. Paddle steamers were introduced also to the river during the Meiji period as the technology became available in Japan.È¶ôÂèñ„ÅÆÂ∑ù  20th century  The advent of the railroad brought an end to inland shipping in the Tone River region. Merchants gradually transferred their businesses to areas in proximity to railroad stations. The Kurobe was especially affected by destruction as a result of a typhoon in 1941, and shipping along the river came to an abrupt end. Katori renaissance The Kurobe River became a popular recreation area as shipping along the river ended in the 20th century. It remains a popular area for canoeing, rowing, and regatta. The first water skiing competition was held in 1987,È¶ôÂèñ„ÅÆÂ∑ù and the Katori City Regatta is held annually in July. Sport fishing is also popular on the Kurobe, and cuisine in local restaurants feature fish from the river. A black bass fishing tournament is held annually.

Organ and tissue transplantation treat a variety of medical problems, ranging from end organ failure to cosmetic surgery. One of the greatest limitations to organ transplantation derives from organ rejection caused by antibodies of the transplant recipient reacting to donor antigens on cell surfaces within the donor organ.Colaco, M., & Atala, A. (2014). The Future of Transplant Biology and Surgery. Interdisciplinary Medicine. Because of unfavorable immune responses, transplant patients suffer a lifetime taking immunosuppressing medication. Stephen F. Badylak pioneered the process of decellularization at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. This process creates a natural biomaterial to act as a scaffold for cell growth, differentiation and tissue development. By recellularizing an ECM scaffold with a patient‚Äôs own cells, the adverse immune response is eliminated. Nowadays, commercially available ECM scaffolds are available for a wide variety of tissue engineering. Using peracetic acid to decellularize ECM scaffolds have been found to be false and only disinfects the tissue. With a wide variety of decellularization-inducing treatments available, combinations of physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments are carefully monitored to ensure that the ECM scaffold maintains the structural and chemical integrity of the original tissue. Scientists can use the acquired ECM scaffold to reproduce a functional organ by introducing progenitor cells, or adult stem cells (ASCs), and allowing them to differentiate within the scaffold to develop into the desired tissue. The produced organ or tissue can be transplanted into a patient. In contrast to cell surface antibodies, the biochemical components of the ECM are conserved between hosts, so the risk of a hostile immune response is minimized. Proper conservation of ECM fibers, growth factors, and other proteins is imperative to the progenitor cells differentiating into the proper adult cells. The success of decellularization varies based on the components and density of the applied tissue and its origin. The applications to the decellularizing method of producing a biomaterial scaffold for tissue regeneration are present in cardiac, dermal, pulmonary, renal, and other types of tissues. Complete organ reconstruction is still in the early levels of development.  Process overview  Researchers are able to take the tissue from a donor or cadaver, lyse and kill the cells within the tissue without damaging the extracellular components, and finish with a product that is the natural ECM scaffold that has the same physical and biochemical functions of the natural tissue. After acquiring the ECM scaffold, scientists can recellularize the tissue with potent stem or progenitor cells that will differentiate into the original type of tissue. By removing the cells from a donor tissue, the immunogenic antibodies from the donor will be removed. The progenitor cells can be taken from the host, therefore they will not have an adverse response to the tissue. This process of decellularizing tissues and organs is still being developed, but the exact process of taking a tissue from a donor and removing all the cellular components is considered to be the decellularization process. The steps to go from a decellularized ECM scaffold to a functional organ is under the umbrella of recellularization. Because of the diverse applications of tissue in the human body, decellularization techniques have to be tailored to the specific tissue being exercised on. The researched methods of decellularization include physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments. Though some methods are more commonly used, the exact combination of treatments is variable based on the tissue‚Äôs origin and what it is needed for. As far as introducing the different liquidized chemicals and enzymes to an organ or tissue, perfusion and immersion decellularization techniques have been used. Perfusion decellularization is applicable when an extensive vasculature system is present in the organ or tissue. It is crucial for the ECM scaffold to be decellularized at all levels, and evenly throughout the structure. Because of this requirement, vascularized tissues can have chemicals and enzymes perfused through the present arteries, veins, and capillaries. Under this mechanism and proper physiological conditions, treatments can diffuse equally to all of the cells within the organ. The treatments can be removed through the veins at the end of the process. Cardiac and pulmonary decellularization often uses this process of decellularization to introduce the treatments because of their heavily vascularized networks. Immersion decellularization is accomplished through the submersion of a tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. This process is more easily accomplished than perfusion, but is limited to thin tissues with a limited vascular system.  Physical treatments  The most common physical methods used to lyse, kill, and remove cells from the matrix of a tissue through the use of temperature, force and pressure, and electrical disruption. Temperature methods are often used in a rapid freeze-thaw mechanism. By quickly freezing a tissue, microscopic ice crystals form around the plasma membrane and the cell is lysed. After lysing the cells, the tissue can be further exposed to liquidized chemicals that degrade and wash out the undesirable components. Temperature methods conserve the physical structure of the ECM scaffold, but are best handled by thick, strong tissues. Direct force of pressure to a tissue will guarantee disruption of the ECM structure, so pressure is commonly used. Pressure decellularization involves the controlled use of hydrostatic pressure applied to a tissue or organ. This is done best at high temperatures to avoid unmonitored ice crystal formation that could damage the scaffold. Electrical disruption of the plasma membrane is another option to lyse the cells housed in a tissue or organ. By exposing a tissue to electrical pulses, micropores are formed at the plasma membrane. The cells eventually turn to death after their homeostatic electrical balance is ruined through the applied stimulus. This electrical process is documented as Non- thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) and is limited to small tissues and the limited possibilities of inducing an electric current in vivo.  Chemical treatments  The proper combination of chemicals is selected for decellularization depending on the thickness, extracellular matrix composition, and intended use of the tissue or organ. For example, enzymes would not be used on a collagenous tissue because they disrupt the connective tissue fibers. However, when collagen is not present in a high concentration or needed in the tissue, enzymes can be a viable option for decellularization. The chemicals used to kill and remove the cells include acids, alkaline treatments, ionic detergents, non-ionic detergents, and zwitterionic detergents. The ionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), is commonly used because of its high efficacy for lysing cells without significant damage to the ECM. Detergents act effectively to lyse the cell membrane and expose the contents to further degradation. After SDS lyses the cell membrane, endonucleases and exonucleases degrade the genetic contents, while other components of the cell are solubilized and washed out of the matrix. SDS is commonly used even though it has a tendency to slightly disrupt the ECM structure. Alkaline and acid treatments can be effective companions with an SDS treatment due to their ability to degrade nucleic acids and solubilize cytoplasmic inclusions. The most well known non-ionic detergent is Triton X-100, which is popular because of its ability to disrupt the interactions between lipids and between lipids and proteins. Triton X-100 does not disrupt protein-protein interactions, which is beneficial to keeping the ECM intact. EDTA is a chelating agent that binds calcium, which is a necessary component for proteins to interact with one another. By making calcium unavailable, EDTA prevents the integral proteins between cells from binding to one another. EDTA is often used with trypsin, an enzyme that acts as a protease to cleave the already existing bonds between integral proteins of neighboring cells within a tissue. Together, the EDTA-Trypsin combination make a good team for decellularizing tissues.  Enzymatic treatments  Enzymes used in decellularization treatments are used to break the bonds and interactions between nucleic acids, interacting cells through neighboring proteins, and other cellular components. Lipases, thermolysin, galactosidase, nucleases, and trypsin have all been used in the removal of cells. After a cell is lysed with a detergent, acid, physical pressure, etc., endonucleases and exonucleases can begin the degradation of the genetic material. Endonucleases cleave DNA and RNA in the middle of sequences. Benzoase, an endonuclease, produces multiple small nuclear fragments that can be further degraded and removed from the ECM scaffold. Exonucleases act at the end of DNA sequences to cleave the phosphodiester bonds and further degrade the nucleic acid sequences. Enzymes such as trypsin act as proteases that cleave the interactions between proteins. Although trypsin can have adverse effects of collagen and elastin fibers of the ECM, using it in a time-sensitive manner controls any potential damage it could cause on the extracellular fibers. Dispase is used to prevent undesired aggregation of cells, which is beneficial in promoting their separating from the ECM scaffold. Experimentation has shown dispase to be most effective on the surface of a thin tissue, such as a lung in pulmonary tissue regeneration. To successfully remove deep cells of a tissue with dispase, mechanical agitation is often included in the process. Collagenase is only used when the ECM scaffold product does not require an intact collagen structure. Lipases are commonly used when decellularized skin grafts are needed. Lipase acids function in decellularizing dermal tissues through delipidation and cleaving the interactions between heavily lipidized cells. The enzyme, Œ±-galactosidase is a relevant treatment when removing the Gal epitope antigen from cell surfaces.  Applications  Decellularized-Matrix- from-Tumorigenic-Human-Mesenchymal-Stem-Cells-Promotes-Neovascularization- pone.0021888.s001 A natural ECM scaffold provides the necessary physical and biochemical environment to facilitate the growth and specialization of potent progenitor and stem cells. Acellular matrices have been isolated in vitro and in vivo in a number of different tissues and organs. The most applicable success from decellularized tissues has come from symmetrical tissues that have less specialization, such as bone and dermal grafts; however, research and success is ongoing at the organ level. Acellular dermal matrices have been successful in a number of different applications. For example, skin grafts are used in cosmetic surgery and burn care. The decellularized skin graft provides mechanical support to the damaged area while supporting the development of host-derived connective tissue. Cardiac tissue has clinical success in developing human valves from natural ECM matrices. A technique known as the Ross procedure uses an acellular heart valve to replace a defective valve, allowing native cells to repopulate a newly functioning valve. Decellularized allografts have been critical in bone grafts that function in bone reconstruction and replacing of deformed bones in patients. The limits to myocardial tissue engineering come from the ability to immediately perfuse and seed and implemented heart into a patient. Though the ECM scaffold maintains the protein and growth factors of the natural tissue, the molecular level specialization has not yet been harnessed by researchers using decellularized heart scaffolds. Better success at using a whole organ from decellularization techniques has been found in pulmonary research. Scientists have been able to regenerate whole lungs in vitro from rat lungs using perfusion- decellularization. By seeding the matrix with fetal rat lung cells, a functioning lung was produced. The in vitro-produced lung was successfully implemented into a rat, which attests to the possibilities of translating an in vitro produced organ into a patient. Other success for decellularization has been found in small intestinal submucosa (SIS), renal, hepatic, and pancreatic engineering. Because it is a thin material, the SIS matrix can be decellularized through immersing the tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. Renal tissue engineering is still developing, but cadaveric kidney matrices have been able to support development of potent fetal kidney cells. Pancreatic engineering is a testament to the molecular specificity of organs. Scientists have not yet been able to produce an entirely functioning pancreas, but they have had success in producing an organ that functions at specific segments. For example, diabetes in rats was shown to decrease by seeding a pancreatic matrix at specific sites. The future applications of decellularized tissue matrix is still being discovered and is considered one of the most hopeful areas in regenerative research.

With the partition of India in 1947, while the main part of the route lay in Pakistan, later Bangladesh, the two ends of the route lying in India were detached. (For more details see Howrah‚ÄìNew Jalpaiguri line). However, the route continued to be operational till the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Thereafter, the route has been closed. The rest of the line has been in use in the respective countries. Gauge changes The Silguri‚ÄìHaldibari line has gone through two successive gauge changes. As most other railway tracks in the area were metre gauge, the line was converted from broad gauge to metre gauge in 1949. Then in the nineteen sixties when broad gauge was introduced in the area, the line was converted back to broad gauge and connected to the new station at New Jalpaiguri. Haldibari‚ÄìChilahati There are proposals to reoperationalise the Haldibari-Chilahati section. Bangladesh Railway will have to construct 7.5 kilometres of new rail tracks from Chilahati to reach the border while the Indian authorities have to set up 4.5 kilometres of tracks from its border to Haldibari railway station. In the Joint Statement issued on the occasion of the visit of the Prime Minister of India to Bangladesh, on 7 September 2011, it was stated: \\" Bangladesh Prime Minister expressed her appreciation to the Indian Prime Minister for amendment of the MoU between the Bangladesh and Indian Railways allowing Rohanpur-Singabad as an additional route for both bulk and container cargo for Nepalese rail transit traffic. Bangladesh side also appreciated the assistance from India for the movement of fertilizers from Bangladesh to Nepal by rail route. They also agreed to re-establish rail connections between Chilahati-Haldibari and Kulaura-Mahishashan in the spirit of encouraging revival of old linkages and transport routes between the two countries.\\" Bangladesh started export of fertilizer to Nepal utilizing the Rahanpur-Singhabad transit point in November 2011.

Marshall started Exhall Grange, Britain's first school to cater specifically for partially sighted children in 1951, becoming the third and was its head master from 1953 until he retired in 1981, making him to date the longest-serving person to hold that position. He also founded The Partially Sighted Society. Career Having taught at Stockingford County School in Nuneaton, in 1951 Marshall was one of the founders of Exhall Grange School, a boarding school based near Coventry, and the first purpose-built school for partially sighted children to be opened in the United Kingdom. He served as Deputy Headmaster from 1951 to 1953, then became Headmaster in 1953, a job he held until his retirement in 1981. He was the first of two headteachers of the school to have been Deputy Head before becoming the actual, when the preceder left; the other being the current Head, Christine Marshall. During his time at the school Marshall earned a national and international reputation as a campaigner for people with visual impairment, and a leading expert on the education of partially sighted children. His work includes developing prototype models of equipment, notably low vision aids, to help children with limited vision to read printed text, which were subsequently adopted by manufacturers. He was also regarded as a leading expert on matters relating to visual disability and eye conditions, publishing three books and over 40 pamphlets relating to the subject, explaining them in simple terms after identifying a need for parents with visually impaired children to have access to more information about their eye condition. Marshall served as Chairman of the College of Teachers of the Blind, and Executive Officer of the Disabled Living Foundation. He was also a member of the Government Committee of Inquiry into the Education of the Visually Handicapped, and a committee member of the International Conference for Education. He was an adviser on teaching visually impaired students in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, and presented several papers on the subject. In 1975 he attended the Pan Pacific Rehabilitation Conference in Singapore. He also founded The Partially Sighted Society (PSS) after encouraging parents to seek help and advice for their children on matters relating to visual aids, and education and career opportunities. The PSS provides help, information and advice for anyone with limited vision. During the 1950s and 1960s Marshall invited artists to work with children from Exhall Grange to encourage them to develop an appreciation of art, and several sculptures were commissioned by him. In 2009 a sculpture created for the school by Barbara Hepworth in 1964 sold at auction for ¬£37,200. George Marshall was awarded the OBE in the 1977 New Year Honours. Following his retirement in 1981 George Marshall became involved with Warwickshire Association for the Blind, and as part of his work for them held regular workshops that enabled the Association's clientele to learn about the visual aids which were available to them. He also Chaired their Appeals Committee which was raising funds for the construction of a new resource centre in Warwick, and was appointed the organisation's Vice Chairman in 1983. Death and legacy George Marshall died on 4 October 1984 as a result of an ongoing chest complaint. In 1999 former students at Exhall Grange paid for the construction of a permanent memorial at the school dedicated to Marshall. He was also honoured by Warwickshire Association for the Blind, who named their resource centre The George Marshall Centre in recognition of his progressive approach in helping blind and partially sighted people. The organisation was based at the Centre until 2009 when it moved to new premises. Warwickshire Association for the Blind also awards a George Marshall Trophy, an annual prize presented to an individual or organisation that has made a significant contribution towards helping visually impaired people.

The storm also brought prolonged gales and rough seas to the rest of the British Isles, as well as parts of Scandinavia. On 8 December, winds reached up to at elevated areas, with sustained wind speeds of up to reported across populous areas. The winds uprooted trees and resulted in the closure of many roads, bridges, schools and businesses. Overall, the storm was the worst to affect Scotland in 10 years, though a stronger storm occurred less than a month afterwards, on 3 January 2012. Although the follow-up storm was more intense, the winter of 2011‚Äì12 is usually remembered for Bawbag among Scots.  Naming  Another image of Cyclone Friedhelm striking the British Isles The Free University of Berlin names low-pressure systems affecting Europe and gave the name Friedhelm to this storm. In Scotland, the storm was dubbed Hurricane Bawbag, the term bawbag being a Scots vulgar word for ‚Äúscrotum‚Äù, which is also used as an insult or as a jocular term of endearment. The name sparked a trending topic on Twitter, which became one of the top trending hashtags worldwide. Stirling Council also used the Twitter tag. Rob Gibson, the Convener of the Scottish Parliamentary Environment Committee, was the first politician to use the term on national television.  Meteorological history  Churned up sea off the west coast of Scotland as photographed from the FAAM research aircraft at about above sea level. At 00:00 UTC on 8 December 2011, the Met Office noted a strong mid-latitude cyclone along the polar front to the west of Scotland. The polar front supported multiple cold fronts moving southeastward through the Atlantic toward mainland Europe, as well as an eastward-moving warm front approaching Great Britain. In conjunction with strong high pressure to the south, an extremely tight pressure gradient developed along the deep low and produced a large area of high winds. Because of the high temperature gradient between the warm and cold air masses, the cyclone underwent a phase of explosive deepening. By 08:00 UTC, the low had attained a minimum barometric pressure of , bringing gale-force winds to much of western Great Britain. The minimum pressure further dipped to around 12:00 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of at least observed at the surface. An overall pressure drop of was observed over just 24 hours, which combined with the extreme winds earned it the label \\"weather bomb\\" by meteorologists. A FAAM research aircraft had intercepted the storm on several occasions as part of the DIAMET research project, providing valuable data on its wind profile, temperature and humidity. By 9 December, the low had crossed Great Britain and moved into the North Sea toward western Scandinavia. The weakening occluded portion of the low‚Äîlocated along its centre‚Äîproduced south-southeasterly gale-force winds across the peninsula. Further north, a large area of heavy snowfall and rough winds developed, while the heaviest rains occurred to the south of the centre. It passed through Sweden with hurricane-force gusts, though its winds and rainfall weakened significantly as it moved over Finland on 10 December.  Preparations and warnings  On 7 December, the Met Office issued a red weather warning‚Äîits highest warning‚Äîfor the Central Belt of Scotland. This was the first time the Met Office had ever issued a red alert for wind for the United Kingdom. They informed the public to take action and urged them to listen to police warnings. By 08:00 UTC on 8 December, all schools in the west of Scotland had been closed, while remaining schools in the east were told to close at lunchtime but there were a lot of schools in West Lothian which decided to stay open all day, following advice from the Scottish Government. In addition, many tertiary centres of education, such as Edinburgh University, Glasgow University who were taking exams on that day, Glasgow Caledonian University and University of the West of Scotland halted their operations as a safety precaution. Also closed were public museums, galleries, sports centres, and many council buildings and libraries. The Police in Scotland advised the public not to travel, and the Tay, Forth, Skye and Erskine bridges were closed to all traffic. Officials feared widespread structural damage to roofs and weak buildings, resulting in the closure of several tourist attractions in central Scotland, including Edinburgh Castle and Princes Street Gardens.  Effects  The storm brought gales to much of the British Isles and large parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula, causing widespread power outages and traffic disruptions. The highest winds occurred in Scotland, where hurricane- force winds battered coastal structures and uprooted trees. Additionally, heavy rainfall flooded some locations in England, Wales and Sweden. Despite the severity of its winds, the storm left no deaths in its wake. The storm was classified Hurricane-force 12 on the Beaufort scale.  Scotland  Ashton area in Gourock, Inverclyde The cyclone brought hurricane-force winds to large portions of Scotland through much of 8 December. The summit of Cairn Gorm recorded a gust speed of , though sustained winds at the surface averaged and in populous areas. The high winds generated large waves along coastlines and blew trees and debris into power lines. About 150,000 Scottish households lost power, 70,000 of which still had not had their electricity returned by nightfall. Two hospitals, The Belford and Victoria Hospital, suffered power and telephone service cuts. The storm disrupted many of Scotland's public transport services, ScotRail operated a reduced timetable across all parts of the country as a result, and routes from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, Perth and Dundee were suspended. Sixty-four passengers on a train running on the West Highland Line were stranded, near Crianlarich, after the line was forced to close In some areas buses ran in place of trains due to line problems. Glasgow Airport cancelled 37 flights, and Edinburgh Airport 21 flights. Ferry services in the Western Isles were also affected, with the majority being cancelled. Bus operators in the Central Belt withdrew double-decker buses from operation after the Scottish Government advised all high sided vehicles not to travel and a number of buses were blown over. In the North Sea, the Petrojarl Banff, a floating production storage and offloading vessel carrying of oil, and the Apollo Spirit, which has on board, lost tension in some of their anchors as they were battered by the hurricane-force winds. The Apollo Spirit lost tension in one of its eight anchors, while five of the ten anchors supporting the Banff went slack. Strathclyde Police reported that they received calls for 500 weather-related incidents during the course of the day. In Campbeltown, Falkirk and Stirling a number of streets were closed after slates and chimneys fell from roofs. High winds toppled a school bus travelling along the A737 near Dalry, North Ayrshire. A wind turbine near Ardrossan burst into flames in the high winds. Additionally, many Christmas lights in Aberdeen were blown down. In Glasgow, the winds caused the River Clyde to burst its banks and overflow.  Ireland  The low produced near hurricane-force gusts across the island of Ireland, with the highest winds reported along Northern Ireland coastal areas. The worst of the storm occurred in County Donegal, where gusts neared . In Dublin, the winds uprooted trees, knocked over bins and blew debris through streets. Some homes lost power during the storm, but the cuts did not cause significant disruption. Rivers rose in the winds and many burst their banks, causing light flooding across minor roads. A few buildings sustained minor wind damage to their roofs. A bridge connecting the Fanad Peninsula to Carrigart was closed to vehicles. Rail and ferry operators suspended their services, leaving passengers stranded.  England and Wales  The storm had a significant impact on parts of the North of England. There was flooding in Cumbria near Windermere, which left some cars adrift in water. High winds prompted the cancellation of train services as far south as Newcastle. In North Yorkshire heavy rain and snow melt combined to cause widespread flooding in Swaledale leading to closure of several roads and the partial collapse of the bridge over the River Swale at Grinton. A search and rescue helicopter from RAF Kinloss was scrambled to rescue those caught in the flooding. Storm conditions and heavy rain hit Wales, while hurricane-force winds were confined to the northern regions. Aberdaron, on the tip of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula, recorded a gust of , which was the highest for the country. In Swansea, winds of up to were reported. Flood alerts were also issued for several rivers in Wales due to the high rainfall. Scandinavia The Swedish Meteorological Institute issued a class two warning. In Gothenburg, roads and some cellars were submerged, and the √Ñlvsborg Bridge and G√∂tatunneln were closed due to high winds. The winds damaged structures and left over 14,000 customers without power. Aftermath Over 70,000 Scottish customers remained without electricity on 9 December, and by 10 December that number had dropped to 2,000. Several schools were shut for a second day, including all schools in Orkney, Caithness and the north coast of Sutherland in the Highlands, while some schools were closed in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Shetland, Stirling and the Western Isles.

Data at rest is subject to threats from hackers and other malicious threats. To prevent this data from being accessed, modified or stolen, organizations will often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. The security options used for this type of data are commonly referred to as data at rest protection (DARP). Figure 1: The 3 states of data. Data at rest is used as a complement to the terms data in use and data in transit which together define the three states of digital data (see Figure 1).  Alternative definition  There is some disagreement as to the boundary between data at rest and data in use. Data at rest generally refers to data stored in persistent storage (disk, tape) while data in use generally refers to data being processed by a computer central processing unit (CPU) or in random access memory (RAM, also referred to as main memory or simply memory). Definitions include: > \\"...all data in computer storage while excluding data that is traversing a > network or temporarily residing in computer memory to be read or updated.\\" Figure 2: Data at Rest vs Data in Use. > \\"...all data in storage but excludes any data that frequently traverses the > network or that which resides in temporary memory. Data at rest includes but > is not limited to archived data, data which is not accessed or changed > frequently, files stored on hard drives, USB thumb drives, files stored on > backup tape and disks, and also files stored off-site or on a storage area > network (SAN).\\" Data in use has also been taken to mean ‚Äúactive data‚Äù in the context of being in a database or being manipulated by an application. For example, some enterprise encryption gateway solutions for the cloud claim to encrypt data at rest, data in transit and data in use. While it is generally accepted that archive data (i.e. which never changes), regardless of its storage medium, is data at rest and active data subject to constant or frequent change is data in use. ‚ÄúInactive data‚Äù could be taken to mean data which may change, but infrequently. The imprecise nature of terms such as ‚Äúconstant‚Äù and ‚Äúfrequent‚Äù means that some stored data cannot be comprehensively defined as either data at rest or in use. These definitions could be taken to assume that Data at Rest is a superset of data in use; however, data in use, subject to frequent change, has distinct processing requirements from data at rest, whether completely static or subject to occasional change. The division of data at rest into the sub-categories \\"static\\" and \\"inconstant\\" addresses this distinction (see Figure 2)..  Concerns about data at rest  Because of its nature data at rest is of increasing concern to businesses, government agencies and other institutions. Mobile devices are often subject to specific security protocols to protect data at rest from unauthorised access when lost or stolenhttp://www.gordon.army.mil/nec/documents/BBP%20Data%20at%20Rest.pdf and there is an increasing recognition that database management systems and file servers should also be considered as at risk; the longer data is left unused in storage, the more likely it might be retrieved by unauthorized individuals outside the network.  Encryption  Data encryption, which prevents data visibility in the event of its unauthorized access or theft, is commonly used to protect data in motion and increasingly promoted for protecting data at rest. The encryption of data at rest should only include strong encryption methods such as AES or RSA. Encrypted data should remain encrypted when access controls such as usernames and password fail. Increasing encryption on multiple levels is recommended. Cryptography can be implemented on the database housing the data and on the physical storage where the databases are stored. Data encryption keys should be updated on a regular basis. Encryption keys should be stored separately from the data. Encryption also enables crypto-shredding at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle. Periodic auditing of sensitive data should be part of policy and should occur on scheduled occurrences. Finally, only store the minimum possible amount of sensitive data.  Tokenization  Tokenization is a non-mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non- sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens, which have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. This process does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. Tokens require significantly less computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally encrypted data. This is achieved by keeping specific data fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Lower processing and storage requirements makes tokenization an ideal method of securing data at rest in systems that manage large volumes of data.  Federation  A further method of preventing unwanted access to data at rest is the use of data federation especially when data is distributed globally (e.g. in off-shore archives). An example of this would be a European organisation which stores its archived data off-site in the USA. Under the terms of the USA PATRIOT Act the American authorities can demand access to all data physically stored within its boundaries, even if it includes personal information on European citizens with no connections to the USA. Data encryption alone cannot be used to prevent this as the authorities have the right to demand decrypted information. A data federation policy which retained personal citizen information with no foreign connections within its country of origin (separate from information which is either not personal or is relevant to off-shore authorities) is one option to address this concern.

Playing career Tessier was selected by the Colorado Avalanche in the 4th round (110th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to turning professional, Tessier played major junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League primarily with the Quebec Remparts before he was traded in his final year to the Moncton Wildcats. Despite not being tendered with a contract by the Avalanche, Tessier turned professional and was invited to the New York Rangers training camp on September 8, 2010. While impressing during the pre- season Tessier was sent to AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack and was later signed to a one-year AHL contract. In his first professional season in 2010‚Äì11, Tessier finished second among rookies in posting 10 goals and 28 points. On July 6, 2011, Tessier was re-signed by the Connecticut Whale for a second season. Tessier repeated his rookie performance with the Whale in 2011‚Äì12, scoring 30 points in 75 games. In the 2012 Calder cup playoffs, Tessier finished with 5 points, to place third among the team. On September 17, 2012, Tessier was re-signed to his third consecutive one-year contract with the Whale. Despite a slow start to the 2012‚Äì13 season, Tessier still produced 11 goals and 13 assists from primarily a depth role in 71 games. As the longest tenured Whale player, Tessier initially agreed to return to the renamed Wolf Pack for a fourth successive season. On July 15, 2013, Tessier was granted a release from his contract and signed a one-year deal with Swedish club, R√∂gle BK of the HockeyAllsvenskan. Tessier was attracted by Sporting director Anders Carlsson, who drafted him whilst apart of the Colorado Avalanche scouting department in 2008. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Tessier quickly established himself amongst R√∂gle's top offensive players. In 52 games, Tessier scored 42 points to lead the club and finish 6th in overall HockeyAllsvenskan points. With ambition to play at a higher level, Tessier left R√∂gle and signed a one-year contract with newly promoted Finnish Liiga club, Vaasan Sport, on April 30, 2014. Tessier played five scoreless games with Sport, before opting to return to the Allsvenskan with Karlskrona HK for the remainder of the season. On July 14, 2015, Tessier signed a one-year contract in a return to newly promoted R√∂gle BK of the SHL. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, Tessier was reduced to a limited role in 10 games with R√∂gle before he mutually agreed to leave the club and sign with IF Bj√∂rkl√∂ven of the Allsvenskan for the remainder of the season on December 30, 2015. As a free agent in the off-season, Tessier moved to Austria, agreeing to an optional two-year deal with the Vienna Capitals of the EBEL on July 13, 2016.

Parasites and Health. Centers for Disease Control. December 2011. http://dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/Coenurosis.htm Hatching of the T. serialis usually occurs only if the eggs have been exposed to gastric secretions proceeded by intestinal secretions. The oncospheres hatch in the intestine, invade the intestinal wall, and are carried in the blood throughout the tissues. Within the tissues, the larvae (also called metacestodes) develop into cysticerci or coenuri, which are larvae that group within cysts. The infection with the metacestode larval form (coenurus) of T. serialis is called Coenurosis. When humans ingest these eggs from definitive host remains, the eggs develop into coenuri. This coenuri can occur in humans within their muscles, brain, eye, or subcutaneous connective tissue though humans are neither the definitive of intermediate hosts of the T. serialis. The symptoms are variable, and depend on the location and number of larvae. Epsiprantel, praziquantel, fenbendazole and surgical removalJohnstone, C. Parasites and Parasitic Diseases of Domestic Animals. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Web. 2000. () (6 December 2011). are used to combat coenuri infection but discretion should be used when treating this evoloving cestode of medical importance. Morphology The eggs of T. serialis are spherical and are 32 to 38 Œºm in diameter. The larvae form bladders called Coenurus metacestode that can grow to be as large as 10 cm in the intermediate hosts. The larvae are white and can mature to 40mm while the adult can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. Taenia serialis is morphologically very similar to Taenia multiceps; however, they infect different areas of the body. T. serialis infects the subcutaneous tissue and T. multiceps will commonly infect the eyes and brain. Life Cycle The eggs are expelled in feces of the dog and ingested by the intermediate rabbit host. In the rabbit or other accidental intermediate host the eggs hatch within the intestines then invade the intestinal wall and move into the bloodstream. The larva circulates in the blood to the central nervous system, muscles, or soft tissue where they can form a coenurus metacestode, which is the intermediate stage of the parasite. A coenurus is a fluid-filled cyst with one or more scoleces surrounded by a fibrous capsule. These normally form after 3 months and are a 10 cm wide lesion.Veterinary Ophthalomology http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1463-5224.2002.00230.x/full These painless nodules present in the skin or subcutaneous tissue are a sign of infection and are used to diagnose a host with the parasite. Once the Coenurus metacestode has been consumed by the fox or dog, it completes its metamorphosis into an adult tapeworm. In the canid, the worm attaches to the intestine and feeds of the food that the host ingests. There the worm matures and can become as long as 5 meters. The adult cestode produces eggs which are spread into the environment by the feces of the definitive host. This life cycle is also very similar to T. pisiformis a canine and rabbit infecting parasite; however, T. pisiformis infected the body cavity of the rabbit and T. serialis infects muscle and subcutaneous tissue. Treatment Treating the lesions can be done with surgery or medicine. Oral praziquantel can be used to kill coenuri; however, the dead parasite will cause a large inflammatory response in the host. The inflammation can be managed with the use of corticosteroids. In many cases surgical removal of the coenurus is a safer option with leakage of fluid from the cyst during surgery being unlikely to cause a new cyst and surgical excision is often curative. Geographic distribution T. serialis has been found in a number of locations including North America, South America, Europe and Africa.

Biography  George Kiraz was born in Bethlehem to a Syriac Orthodox merchant family which traces its roots back to Elazƒ±ƒü in Anatolia. He learned Syriac at Monastery of Saint Mark, Jerusalem. In 1983 he emigrated with his family to the United States where they settled in Los Angeles. He holds numerous degrees including a B.Sc. degree in Engineering from California State University in 1990, a master's degree in Syriac Studies from University of Oxford in 1991, a master's degree in computer speech and language processing, and a Ph.D. degree in computational linguistics from University of Cambridge in 1992 and 1996 respectively. In 1986 he designed the first computer fonts for Syriac and established a one-person company in Los Angeles named Alaph Beth Computer Systems for their distribution. He developed the proposal for encoding Syriac in Unicode (with Paul Nelson and Sargon Hasso) and designed the Unicode compliant Meltho fonts which enable Syriac computing on modern computers. His fonts are by far the most popular Computer Syriac fonts used in modern days. He has been involved in Syriac related projects such as the co-founding of Gorgias Press, a publishing house dedicated to Syriac studies and other subjects in the humanities, and directing the institute of Beth Mardutho, which seeks to promote Syriac heritage and language. Between 1996 and 2000 he worked at Bell Labs as a member of technical staff in the Language Modeling Group. Between 2000 and 2001 he was instrumental in opening an office for Nuance Communications on Wall Street, New York. His research interests include finite-state technology, computational morphology and phonology, and Syriac studies. He coined the term Garshunography to refer to the writing on one language in the script of another. He is married to Christine Kiraz. They live with their three children in Piscataway, New Jersey.  Bibliography  Kiraz has published a number of books concerning Syriac languages, and co-authored many others: *The Syriac primer: reading, writing, vocabulary & grammar: with exercises and cassette activities, 1988. *Computer-Generated Concordance to the Syriac New Testament, six volumes, 1993. *Lexical tools to the Syriac New Testament, 1994. *Anton Kiraz's archive on the Dead Sea scrolls, 2005. *The new Syriac primer: an introduction to the Syriac language with a CD, 2007. *Comparative Edition of the Syriac Gospels: Aligning the Old Syriac (Sinaiticus, Curetonianus), Peshitta and Harklean Versions, 2003. *The acts of Saint George and the story of his father: from the Syriac and Garshuni versions, 2009. *Introduction to Syriac Spirantization, Rukk√¢k√¢ and Qu≈°≈°√¢y√¢ (Losser, The Netherlands: Bar Hebraeus Verlag, 1995) *Computational Nonlinear Morphology, with Emphasis on Semitic Languages (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2002) *Syriac Alphabet for Children: Serto Edition (Piscataway, N.J.: Gorgias Press, 2004) *(With Sebastian P.

It was also revealed that the DLC that was on the Vita version would be free at launch. The PlayStation 3 version also adds two new modes, \\"Slot Mode\\" and \\"Minna no Short Course.\\" Slot Mode gives players certain advantages that are won via slots. Minna no Short Course puts players on courses that consists exclusively of short holes. The game brought two courses back from previous games such as Mt. Sakura C.C. and Northern Fox C.C. Reception The Vita version received \\"generally favourable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics praised the game, with PlayStation LifeStyle calling it \\"an outstanding game, bursting with fun, and enjoyable by gamers of all demographics\\" in its review. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer said, \\"Everybody's Golf will never stand centre stage in the Vita's launch line-up.

Description The large shell is elongate-oval and vitreous. Its length measures 5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, smooth, deeply obhquely immersed in the first post-nuclear turn, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The six whorls of the teleoconch are strongly rounded, decidedly contracted at the sutures and strongly shouldered at the summit. The first is marked by four slender spiral cords and numerous exceedingly fine axial threads. The next three have twenty strong, rounded, axial ribs, which terminate at the posterior edge of the fourth keel, leaving this smooth. On the body whorl the ribs are decidedly enfeebled, being replaced by numerous axial threads. The spiral sculpture consists of four strong cords between the sutures, the three which cross the ribs form strong nodules at their junction with them, while the supraperipheral one is smooth. The sutures are strongly impressed and slightly channeled. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded. They are marked by eight spiral keels, which grow successively weaker from the periphery to the umbilical region, the last three being very fine. The spaces separating the cords equal to them,are crossed by numerous slender, axial threads. The aperture is irregularly ovate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is strong, rendered decidedly sinuous by the axial ribs. The columella is short, decidedly twisted, strongly curved and reflected. It is reinforced by the base and provided with a deep-seated fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.

It was created by Steve Fawkner and was developed by Strategic Studies Group (SSG). Gameplay Warlords featured eight different clans battling for the control of the mythical land of Illuria: Sirians, Storm Giants, Grey Dwarves, Orcs of Kor, Elvallie, Horse Lords, Selentines, and Lord Bane. Each clan could either be controlled by the computer or by a human player, allowing up to eight participants taking turns in hot seat play. Gameplay consisted of moving units, attacking opponent units or cities, adjusting production in cities, and moving hero units to explore ruins, temples, libraries, and to discover allies, relics, and other items. The goal of the game was to conquer the land of Illuria by capturing or razing at least two thirds of the cities in the land. Reception Reviewers cited the basic sound and average graphics of the game, compensated by simple user interface and \\"high dollar-to-play value\\". Computer Gaming World favorably cited the sophisticated computer opponents, and concluded that the game \\"has everything to offer the strategy gamer who has a taste for a bit of the fantasy genre\\", especially those who enjoyed Empire or Reach for the Stars. The magazine named the game and Command HQ as its 1991 Wargames of the Year. In a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five, stating that it was \\"eminently playable\\". Warlords was named the 67th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The editors called it \\"one of the most revolutionary multi-player experiences of the Nineties.\\" Reviews *Amiga Action - May, 1991 *ASM (Aktueller Software Markt) - Mar, 1991 *CU Amiga - May, 1991 *Computer Gaming World - Apr, 1991 References External links *Warlords at MobyGames *Warlords at Hall Of Light *Review in Compute!

Willers was born in London but settled in Ireland. He spent most of his later life in Carrigower and for over 40 years in Rathdrum, both in County Wicklow. In 1992, Willers was the co-founder and chairman of the Guinness International Cartoon Festival, which ran for three years in Rathdrum. He was a winner of the Jacobs Award for his work for television. Writing in the Irish Independent, Tom Mathews recalls, \\"Nobody who encountered Terry in full flight in his persona as Rathdrum's cartoon ambassador to the world is likely to forget him... Terry must have had three hands because despite having a cigarette in one and a glass in the other, he was always drawing on any surface that held still ‚Äî even the walls of his beloved Cartoon Inn at Rathdrum village where so many of his exhuberand productions are still displayed.\\" Mathews describes Willers as \\"a stylish and dapper dresser\\" who was never seen without a shirt and tie and \\"the sort of pastel blazer favoured by the gameshow host that he so resembled\\". Writing in the Irish Times, fellow cartoonist Martyn Turner wrote, \\"He was always very happy and full of jokes and was an incredibly talented artist. Most cartoonists become cartoonists because they have to... but Terry could draw anything and everything. In many ways he was an artist more than he was a cartoonist.\\" Willers' career is said to have begun at the age of 15 when he joined Mickey Mouse Weekly. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/willers_terry.htmAt the age of 17 he was certainly contributing the four-panel cartoon 'Tich' to TV Comic (1952-53). In 1959 he also contributed to Zip and Jack & Jill comics. Around this time, Willers began working for the Marten Toonder Studio in the Netherlands, drawing 'Panda' and, from 1963, 'Tom Poes', a hugely popular newspaper strip created by Toonder in 1941. According to Lambiek, \\"he added a slapstick element to the strips, and intensified the absurdism in the artwork.\\" https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/willers_terry.htmThe strip ran in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant and various regional papers until 1965. He then went to draw 'Kappie', the adventures of Captain Anne Wobke and the crew of his tug, the Kraak for three years. In 1968, he returned to 'Tom Poes', when he did a comic strip for Donald Duck comic. Willers also contributed briefly to British comics during this period, ghosting episodes of 'General Nitt and His Barmy Army' and 'Georgie's Germs' for Wham!.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/willers_terry.htm Willers contributed in the 1970s and 1980s to Hall's Pictorial Weekly, hosted by Frank Hall, and The Mike Murphy Show, broadcast on Ireland's RT√â. He was also a prolific contributor to magazines, including the Farmer's Journal, Sunday Independent, Evening Herald and Wicklow People. In the 1990s, Willers contributed to The Yellow Press, an Irish anthology comic, and The Beano, drawing 'Minder Bird' in 1995. He also illustrated several books, including Brian Power presents 'It's All Happening' (1970), The TV Generation by Desmond Forristal (1970), Gift of the Gab!

With a history of 90 years and about 40 participating groups it marks one of the biggest and most important Erntedankfest celebrations in the Rheinland. It includes church services, huge parades and music in a traditional fair atmosphere.  History  The Erntedankfest is an important part of Urdenbach's tradition and marks one of the most important events in the south of D√ºsseldorf and the Rheinland. It differs essentially from the Erntedankfest celebrations in Northern America. In the early 1900s, D√ºsseldorf-Urdenbach was characterized by its agriculture and nature reserves. During that time the Erntedankfest was celebrated by actual farmers to thank God for the harvest. Later, when most of the farmers turned away from their initial business, the remaining farmers were not able to continue this tradition on their own. At that time, in the middle of the 1900s, the ABVU (Allgemeiner B√ºrgerverein Urdenbachs / engl.: \\"general citizens association of Urdenbach\\") overtook the management of the Erntedankfest and is still responsible for its execution. Nowadays most of the participating groups do not have an actual farming background, but a common interest for the traditions of Urdenbach.  Order of events  A traditionally decorated trailer during the Erntedank parade The Erntedankfest parade always takes place the first Sunday after each year's September 29, the Michaelistag (engl.: Michaelmas). The Erntedankfest celebration lasts from Friday to Monday. The sequence of events and their schedule is almost the same every year. The starting point is the mass in one of the churches in Urdenbach on Friday evening.ABVU Urdenbach (2010). \\"Ich glaub es geht schon wieder los...\\". Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 82, 2010 p. 5. On Saturday most of the groups finalize their preparations during the day for the parade on Sunday. In the evening, people of Urdenbach come together in a big party tent at Piel's Loch (the local fairground) with a special evening's entertainment. Usually entertainment is provided by a DJ and a live band.ABVU Urdenbach (2010). Und mittags ging die Sonne auf. Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 80, 2010 p. 3-5. On Sunday usually at 11am a concert takes places at Piel's Loch while people can have a traditional dish: oaf on a spit. At 1pm the Erntedankfest groups gather to get ready for the Erntedank parade through Urdenbach, which starts at 2pm and marks the highlight of the weekend. About 40 groups present their individual contributions to the Erntedankfest in form of traditionally decorated tractors and trailers, typical farmers' tools and the traditional costumes worn by the group members. Up to 40.000 visitors line the streets of Urdenbach to get a glimpse of the parade.ABVU Urdenbach (2008). Goldener Oktober zum Erntedank. Kleine Urdenbacher Post, Nr. 74, 2008 p. 10. Right after the parade the \\"Sch√ºrreskarrenrennen\\" (engl.: traditional wheelbarrow race) takes place. Members of different groups try to finish a fixed distance first with their traditionally decorated wheelbarrows and wearing the traditional costumes, including bulky clogs. The winner of the race is announced in the party tent later. In late afternoon, citizens of Urdenbach and guests celebrate together at places all over the borough, in the party tent, pubs, and at numerous beer stalls. On Monday the \\"Blotschenball\\" (engl.: \\"clogs ball\\") takes place, where the new Blotschenk√∂nigspaar (engl.: \\"royal clogs couple\\") is announced.ABVU Urdenbach (2008).

The Horyn, Vilia, Poltva and other rivers flow through the district. There is a rail line through the district (Shepetivka‚ÄîTernopil). History The raion (district) was created on 7 March 1923 as Lyakhivtsi Raion within Shepetivka Okruha, Volhynia Governorate. In 1925 all governorates of Ukraine were liquidated. From 1923 to 1930 the district was part of the Shepetivka Okruha (see Okruhas of Ukraine). In 1930 all okruhas of Ukraine were liquidated. In 1932 it was included to the newly formed Vinnytsia Oblast. In 1935-37 Lyakhivtsi Raion was part of the Soviet Shepetivka border okrug (still part of Vinnytsia Oblast), which was part of border okrug system that stretched along the western border of the Soviet Union. In 1937 there was created Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast based on three border okrugs (Kamianets-Podilskyi, Proskuriv, and Shepetivka). Lyakhivtsi Raion became a part of the newly formed oblast. During the World War II, raion was occupied by the Nazi Germany in 1941-1944 and was dissolved, while its territory was part of the Wolhynien und Podolien General bezirk. Following the war, Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast was revived, while in 1946 Lyakhivtsi were renamed to Bilohiria, while Lyakhivtsi Raion became Bilohiria Raion. In 1954 the administrative center was moved from Kamianets-Podilskyi to Khemlnytskyi (before 1954 Proskuriv) and the oblast was renamed as Khmelnytskyi Oblast.

Hiding his anger, he seeks out his former middle school classmate Jong-suk (Yang Ik-june). Jong-suk now works as a ghostwriter for an autobiography, but he dreams of writing his own novel. For the first time in 15 years they meet. Kyung-min and Jong-suk both hide their own current situations and begin to talk about their middle school days. At their middle school, they were classified by their wealth, grades as well as stature. Kyung-min and Jong-suk were at the bottom. They were called \\"pigs\\" and were bullied by a ruling class known as \\"dogs\\". When they were called pigs they got angry, but couldn't do anything against the dogs. Then a King of Pigs appears - Kim Chul (Kim Hye-na). Kyung-min and Jong-suk began to rely on Kim Chul. Whilst in the present Kyung-min leads Jong-suk to their middle school grounds to disclose to Jong-suk the shocking truth about what happened to Chul 15 years ago.

The tombs, dating from 386-581, were discovered in 1974. In 1992, the State Council named the group a national key cultural relic. Discovery In 1974, Dong Weiyao's Tomb of Zhao was discovered. In 1975, the Tomb of Northern Qi Yao June was discovered and 136 pottery figurines were unearthed. 1979, the discovery of Tomb of Princess Ru Ru and 1056 pottery figurines as well as some pottery horses and ceramic camels. Among the eight golden articles, there are two Byzantine coins which is useful for the study of the relationships between China and Byzantium during that period. There is 320-square-metre mural along the tomb massage, and is about the main content is about the troop that shows the dignity of an emperor's funeral. From 1987 to 1989, Tomb of Emperor of Northern Qi Wenxuan was discovered and more than 1800 pottery figurines were unearthed. Connotation The large amount of pottery figurines discovered in Tomb of Princess Ru Ru actually represents the politics of that time. Ru Ru became a strong national in the north in the last years of the Northern Wei. The large amount of funeral objects is not only the representation of the noble life of luxury and the princess identity of honor but also the respect to Ru Ru. It is the politics that behind funeral objects. The pottery figurines that unearthed are mainly Terracotta soldiers which shows the social realism that people suffered from warfare. There are many different people from different nationalities in character figurines which shows wishes of the ruler of ethnic fusion. National amalgamation is the main subject of that time. Construction of figures The height of the pottery figurines is usually short. The smallest one is only two inches tall and the big one will be one foot tall. The highest figurine is 1.6 metres high that was discovered in Tomb of Emperor of Northern Qi Wenxuan. Because the scale of tombs that time is small but puts a lot of objects in it and also relates to its financial missteps and other social elements. There are many sorts of sculptures, such as men, animals, quart pots etc. There are about 20 different shapes of humans and they are depicted very carefully even more carefully than Terracotta Army and displays national features.

If the destination is upwind but the sailboat goes fastest heading away from this direction, this poses a significant problem: how to choose tack headings with the best tradeoff between maximimizing speed and minimizing distance. The ability to define an efficient tacking route is an important issue in sailboat racing, and for recreational sailing. It is also an important issue of navigational safety, so that the sailboat is able to arrive before dark.

He was born in Bratislava. Musicologist Dezs√∂ Leg√°ny theorized that Spech must have been inspired to study music by the rich musical life of the city, where the opera theater regularly programmed works by Haydn, Mozart, and other acknowledged masters of the time. Spech received primary music education, but also studied law, and in 1792 he became a law clerk in Buda. A few years later he left for Vienna to study with Haydn. Researcher Tia DeNora notes that a discrepancy exists in biographical materials related to the next decades of Spech's life. Sources chosen for the New Grove dictionary suggest that Spech subsequently left for Hungary and worked as a civil servant intermittently for a number of years, while also being a theater conductor and pursuing a composer's career. However, Spech's great-grandson, when interviewed by the legendary scholar H. C. Robbins Landon, claimed that Spech followed his studies with Haydn by an extensive four-year course in the Paris Conservatory, after which he returned to Hungary and concentrated entirely on his musical career. He died in Oberlimbach (now Grad) after having lived some time in Vienna and Paris. Spech's most numerous works are his settings of Hungarian songs, but his oeuvre also includes the following: * opera Ines und Pedro, oder Die Johannisnacht (first performance 1814) * opera Der Vogel des Bruder Philipp (first performance 1821) * opera (\\"romantic fairytale\\") Felizie * oratorio Die Befreiung von Jerusalem * 7 cantatas * 9 string quartets (3 published in Vienna as Opus 2 by 1803) * 6 sonatas * numerous settings of Hungarian songs (most published in Pest in 1805-23) Dezs√∂ Leg√°ny describes Spech's style as a mixture of influences: late Mozart, Schubert, contemporary French and Italian styles, and the rhythmic features of Hungarian music. Spech's works are rarely recorded. One of the few available records was made by the Festetics String Quartet for the Hungaroton label in the early 2000s.  References  * DeNora, Tia.

The experiment relies on a particular social approach when the main source of information is people with their knowledge and point of view. To carry out a social experiment, specialists usually divide participants into two groups ‚Äî active participants (people who take action in some event) and respondents (people who react to the action). Throughout the period of the experiment, participants are monitored by specialists to identify the effects and differences as a result of the experiment. Social experiments have also been used by companies to collect data about consumers and their opinion about a product or some particular topic. History In 1895, American psychologist Norman Triplett constructed one of the earliest known social experiments, in which he found out that cyclists managed to ride a bike faster when racing against another person rather than racing against the clock. He duplicated the experiment in a laboratory using children and fishing reels and received similar results. Field social experiments had proved to be efficient as it reflects real life due to its natural setting. The social experiments that are commonly referred to today were conducted decades later, in which an experiment is done in a controlled environment such as a Laboratory. A famous example of this is Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment in 1963. Social experiments began in the United States as a test of the negative income tax concept in the late 1960s and since then have been conducted on all the populated continents. During the 1970s, criticism of the ethics and accusations of gender and racial bias led to a reassessment of both the field of social psychology and the conducted experiments. While experimental methods were still employed, other methods gained popularity.  Ethics  Social experimentation has raised many ethical concerns, due to its manipulation of large groups of the population, often without the consent or knowledge of the subjects. In certain cases, Social experimentation has been staged unknown to the viewer in order to promote the image of the individual or for the pure purpose of generating controversy. Researchers also believed that the impact of Informal Social Experiments via social media videos may have negative consequences on formal social marketing research as well as the society in general, detailing that while Informal Social Experiments addresses moral and social issues such as child safety, self-confidence, etc, producers of these social experiments do it for their own gain and benefits. Well-known social experiments  Bystander Apathy (Effect)  Based around the murder of Kitty Genovese right outside her home, The New York Times stated that there were 38 witnesses that either saw or heard the fatal stabbing take place, and not a single person came to her aid. Although this number was proven to be exaggerated, this murder was known as what was coined \\"bystander apathy\\" by social psychologists Bibb Latan√© and John Darley in 1968. For their experiment, Latan√© and Darley tried to replicate the Genovese slaying by having participants aware of each other but unable to communicate directly. Each participant was in a cubical in contact with each other via a microphone, however, only one voice was allowed to speak at a time. A taped recording played of a participant having an epileptic seizure. When the participant believed themselves to be alone they invariably attempted to find help. When the participant believed others were around the speed and frequency of response declined significantly. The authors concluded that situational factors play an influential role in bystander apathy. People are less likely to help in an emergency if other people are present. Two reasons were offered by Latan√© and Darley: first is diffusion of responsibility. The second is pluralistic ignorance or the mentality that if nobody else is helping, then I am not needed as well. Current research on bystander apathy by psychologist Kyle Thomas et al. found that people's decisions to help are influenced by their level of knowledge. While the diffusion of responsibility and pluralistic ignorance are factors, the researchers found that bystanders‚Äô decisions also consider what they know about other bystanders and the situation before getting involved. HighScope The HighScope Perry Preschool Project was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 123 children (58 were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the program and a control group of 65 children that did not). Prior to the program, the preschool and control groups were equivalent in measures of intellectual performance and demographic characteristics. After the program, the educational and life outcomes for the children receiving the program were much superior to outcomes for the children not receiving the program. Many of the program effects were significant or approaching significance.Significant Benefits, The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study Through Age 27Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy: Social Programs That Work: Perry Preschool Project At age 40, the participants were interviewed once more, and school, social services, and arrest records were pulled. The participants had higher-earning jobs, committed fewer crimes, and were more likely to hold a job than adults who did not attend preschool. RAND Health Insurance Experiment The RAND Health Insurance Experiment was an experimental study of health care costs, utilization, and outcomes in the United States, which assigned people randomly to different kinds of plans and followed their behavior, from 1974 to 1982. As a result, it provided stronger evidence than studies that examine people afterward who were not randomly assigned.

It did not have enough statistical power to tell whether people who got less appropriate or needed care were more likely to die as a result. Oportunidades/Prospera/Progresa Opportunidades (now rebranded as \\"Prospera\\") is a government social assistance (welfare) program in Mexico founded in 2002, based on a previous program called Progresa, created in 1997.Paying for Better Parenting, New York Times, Accessed 12/07/06 It is designed to target poverty by providing cash payments to families in exchange for regular school attendance, health clinic visits, and nutrition support.Mexico's Oportunidades Program Accessed 12/07/06 Oportunidades is credited with decreasing poverty and improving health and educational attainment in regions where it has been deployed.Bulletin of the World Health Organization - Reaching Mexico's poorest Accessed 12/07/06 Moving to Opportunity Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing was a randomized social experiment sponsored by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in the 1990s among 4600 low-income families with children living in high-poverty public housing projects. The program was designed based on the assumption that households benefit from living in higher-opportunity neighborhoods. Early evaluations of the MTO program, however, showed minimal gains for participant families. One explanation for these findings is the short length of time which MTO families typically spent in lower-poverty neighborhoods; the positive effects of longer-term exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods appear more promising. Stanford prison experiment The Stanford prison experiment was a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. The experiment was conducted at Stanford University on August 14‚Äì20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. It was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval ResearchFAQ on official site and was of interest to both the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. The experiment is a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks. Experiments by Muzafer Sherif Sherif was a founder of modern social psychology, who developed several unique and powerful techniques for understanding social processes, particularly social norms, and social conflict. Sherif's experimental study of the autokinetic movement demonstrated how mental evaluation norms were created by human beings. Sherif is equally famous for the Robbers Cave Experiments. This series of experiments, begun in Connecticut and concluded in Oklahoma, took boys from intact middle-class families, who were carefully screened to be psychologically normal, delivered them to a summer camp setting (with researchers doubling as counselors), and created social groups that came into conflict with each other.  Bobo doll experiment  The Bobo doll experiment was a study carried out by Albert Bandura who was a professor at Stanford University. It focused on the study of aggression using three groups of preschoolers as the subjects. Bandura took inflatable plastic toys called Bobo dolls and weighted them down to always stand upright. The preschoolers were divided into three groups by gender, and then into six subgroups. One of the groups would observe an adult act aggressively towards the Bobo doll, another group would observe an adult with non-aggressive behaviors, and the last group would not be exposed to any behavior models. The study found the preschoolers exposed to the aggressive behavior had imitated the aggressiveness towards the doll, regardless of gender. The other two groups showed significantly less hostility towards the doll. The study had shown aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors were learned by observing others and had a significant effect on the subjects even after the study was concluded..https://www.britannica.com/event/Bobo-doll-experiment  Stanford marshmallow experiment  The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a study done by a psychologist Walter Mischel on delayed gratification in the early 1970s. During the three studies, In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward provided immediately or two small rewards if they waited for a short period, approximately 15 minutes, during which the tester left the room and then returned. (The reward was sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel.) In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures.  Asch Conformity experiment  The Asch experiment took place in the Swarthmore College in 1951. Solomon Asch conducted an experiment to investigate the extent where social pressure from a majority group could affect a person to confirm. Asch took 50 people from the college to participate in a vision test. They were paired up with 7 other people who they believed to be random, but instead were part of a control group who would choose the same answers. The real participant would give his or her answers last. Out of the 18 trials, the group gave the wrong answers 12 times. 75% of the participants conformed once or more, and the remaining 25% never conformed to the group's wrong answers. Participants were interviewed after the experiment, and although they knew the answers were wrong, they confirmed to not be ridiculed by the group. A few individuals said they thought the group's answers were correct. Asch concluded that people confirmed because they either wanted to fit in or thought the group was right.  Hawthorne experiment  The Hawthorne experiment took place in 1924 in the city of Chicago. Elton Mayo is widely known as the person behind the project. However, his involvement started in 1928 after he was invited by George Pennock, the Assistant Works Manager for the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric. During the experiment, workers were separated into two groups to study the effects of different incentives on their productivity. Different variations were tested, such as changing the light levels in the rooms. Other, more obvious incentives, such as monetary incentives and rest pauses, were also tested and seemed to show positive results. Several conclusions were made, after the experiments finished: * When employees had more freedom to choose their own conditions and output standards, their productivity increased; * Social interaction played an important role in the creation of a high level of group cohesion; * People tend to put more effort when they feel their worth and cooperate with each other.

The Lake Tahoe Concours d'Elegance is an event held at Lake Tahoe yearly, and serves as one of the most prestigious judging events for classic wooden boats. The event, held over a two- to three-day span in August of every year (with the years 2009 and 2010 being exceptions, held in June), started in 1972 by wooden boat enthusiasts and experts of Lake Tahoe to judge boats much like in a car concours. Now officially hosted by the Tahoe Yacht Club, since 1994, the show has become a renowned event in the wooden boat world. Each year the show raises money for charitable donation, with $32,000 being donated in 2010, with total donations from 1994 to present have totaled over $200,000.  History  The Lake Tahoe Concourse d'Elegance was started at the Tahoe City Marina in 1972, by wooden boat enthusiasts and owners seeking to create a judging and display spectacle for their boats. In 1994, the Tahoe Yacht Club (founded 1925) began hosting the show, and moved the event to Sierra Boat Company's marina in Carnelian Bay. Each year a painting by artist Roy Dryer III is made and used as the official poster of that year's show.  Events  The show on judging day, as seen from atop the Sierra Boat building at the 2011 Concours. An example of a blonde deck of a Chris-Craft, called so because of the gold varnish. The show is a centerpiece of the Wooden Boat Week at Lake Tahoe, which consists of the show itself, various barbecue events for yacht club members, and the Woodie-Over-The-Bottom race, which is a multi-step race over an annually changing course that consists of completing multiple tasks at predetermined speeds, such as one year circling an buoy with Osama Bin Laden's picture as many times as there are syllables in his name; the week is finished with a celebration called Mahogany Magic, which showcases a slideshow of all the events that transpired over that week. The show originally started on a Thursday, closed to the public, where the boats' engines would be run as the first step in the judging process. The show officially began on Friday, to VIP visitors, the day the judging would take place (although it would extend into Saturday). The show has many classes, for each marque of boat, as well as perpetual awards; a Marque Class was selected each year, as the predominant show theme, where boats from the specific class, ranging from Chris-Crafts to Boats of the 1920s. One the Saturday of the show, after all judging ends, the boats make a celebratory exit from the Sierra Boat Marina, as they head to the awards ceremony, or wherever the owners wish to go afterwards.  Judging  From the beginning, the show was intended to be a place for owners to both show off their boats, and for them to be judged. Over the show's years, the judging system has been refined, and first-place boats are considered world- class. The judging system consists of a 100-point judging rubric, in which every aspect from hardware, to finish, to wiring and upholstery are thoroughly examined. Points are taken off for things such as incorrect wiring (from original), incorrect varnish color, imperfections in the finish, incorrect upholstery color, and hardware that isn't correct for the boat. Boats, unlike cars, need not their original engine, but must have an engine that is correct for that boat model, that year; if it was an option that year for a Hemi, but the boat originally has a Chevrolet engine, so long as everything has been restored as the boat would be configured with the Hemi, it will not face a deduction. Because of the 100-point system, there may be multiple first-place boats for that class, or there may only be second or third-place boats. As the prestige of the show has grown, and restorations get better, it is said by many judges and experts that some first-place boats may be restored to a condition better than it would have had exiting the factory. Judges are all highly knowledgeable in wooden boats, and each judging team for a class has a lead judge, who is a foremost expert in that class, for instance Rivas. The chief judge of the show is a foremost expert in almost all wooden boats in general, and he has the expertise to oversee the entire process, and is a source for lead judges, as lead judges are for the judges, to clarify on questions, and make a final decision. Once the boats are judged, the judges from each class go to a respective table within the yacht club, away from the crowds, and discuss each boat and consider deductions based on all the judges' notes, to give a final score. Because of this rigorous process over its 39-year history, the show's judges and judging system are renowned, and it is the 'Pebble Beach' of wooden boat shows.  Classes  An example of a first- place winning Riva Tritone. There are many classes in the show, to cover all types of wooden boats, from Hackercrafts to Stancrafts, and all other in between. This is a list of the classes from the 2011 Concours. *Class 1- Lakers & Launches *Class 2- Outboards & Canoes *Class 3- Triple Cockpit Runabouts Over 23 ft. *Class 4- Triple Cockpit Runabouts Under 23 ft. *Class 4- Utility Models *Class 5- Pre-War Runabouts (war being WWII) *Class 6- Post- War Runabouts *Class 7- Blonde Deck Runabouts *Class 8- Riva & International Entries *Class 9- Sedan Runabouts *Class 10- Youth Entries *Class 11- Sedan Runabouts (there is no #10 listed) *Class 12- Racing Runabouts / Gentlemen's Racers *Class 13- Open Class *Class 14- Marque Class (2011, Gar Woods)  References  Category:Boat shows ","title":"Lake Tahoe Concours d'Elegance"},{"id":"33994408","text":"Odostomia sanctorum is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.

Its length measures 2.5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The 4¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, very slightly contracted at the sutures, moderately shouldered at the summits. They are marked by a strongly incised spiral line a little distance below the summit, and three feeble ones of which one is at the periphery, the other two dividing the space between those two into three equal areas. These lines, excepting the one near the summit, which is strong throughout, are best developed on the early whorls. In addition to the spiral sculpture, the whorls are marked between the sutures by strong lines of growth and indications of feeble axial ribs which tend to render the early whorls somewhat nodulous. The sutures are strongly impressed. The periphery of the body whorl are strongly inflated. The base of the shell is well rounded posteriorly, slightly attenuated anteriorly. It is marked by six well incised equal and subequally spaced spiral grooves which are crossed by many slender axial threads. The aperture is large, oval, effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is moderately strong, curved, reflected, reinforced by the base and provided with a deep-seated fold. Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off Lower California.

The matrices correspond to either a single holomorphic function on the unit disk or a pair of holomorphic functions on the unit disk and its complement. The Grunsky inequalities express boundedness properties of these matrices, which in general are contraction operators or in important special cases unitary operators. As Grunsky showed, these inequalities hold if and only if the holomorphic function is univalent. The inequalities are equivalent to the inequalities of Goluzin, discovered in 1947. Roughly speaking, the Grunsky inequalities give information on the coefficients of the logarithm of a univalent function; later generalizations by Milin, starting from the Lebedev‚ÄìMilin inequality, succeeded in exponentiating the inequalities to obtain inequalities for the coefficients of the univalent function itself. The Grunsky matrix and its associated inequalities were originally formulated in a more general setting of univalent functions between a region bounded by finitely many sufficiently smooth Jordan curves and its complement: the results of Grunsky, Goluzin and Milin generalize to that case. Historically the inequalities for the disk were used in proving special cases of the Bieberbach conjecture up to the sixth coefficient; the exponentiated inequalities of Milin were used by de Branges in the final solution. A detailed exposition using these methods can be found in . The Grunsky operators and their Fredholm determinants are also related to spectral properties of bounded domains in the complex plane. The operators have further applications in conformal mapping, Teichm√ºller theory and conformal field theory.  Grunsky Matrix  If f(z) is a holomorphic univalent function on the unit disk, normalized so that f(0) = 0 and f‚Ä≤(0) = 1, the function : g(z) = f(z^{-1})^{-1} is a non-vanishing univalent function on z > 1 having a simple pole at ‚àû with residue 1: : g(z) = z + b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots The same inversion formula applied to g gives back f and establishes a one-one correspondence between these two classes of function. The Grunsky matrix (cnm) of g is defined by the equation :\\\\log\\\\frac{g(z)-g(\\\\zeta)}{z-\\\\zeta} = -\\\\sum_{m,n>0}c_{nm}z^{-m}\\\\zeta^{-n} It is a symmetric matrix. Its entries are called the Grunsky coefficients of g. Note that :\\\\log{g(z^{-1})-g(\\\\zeta^{-1})\\\\over z^{-1}-\\\\zeta^{-1}} = \\\\log{f(z)-f(\\\\zeta)\\\\over z -\\\\zeta} -\\\\log {f(z)\\\\over z} -\\\\log {f(\\\\zeta)\\\\over \\\\zeta}, so that the coefficients can be expressed directly in terms of f. Indeed, if :\\\\log{f(z)-f(\\\\zeta)\\\\over z -\\\\zeta} = -\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 0} d_{mn} z^n \\\\zeta^n, then for m, n > 0 :d_{mn} = c_{mn} and d0n = dn0 is given by :\\\\log \\\\frac{f(z)}{z} = \\\\sum_{n>0} d_{0n} z^n with :d_{00}=0. Grunsky inequalities If f is a holomorphic function on the unit disk with Grunsky matrix (cnm), the Grunsky inequalities state that :\\\\left\\\\sum_{1\\\\le m,n \\\\le N} c_{mn}\\\\lambda_m \\\\lambda_n \\\\right\\\\le \\\\sum_{1\\\\le n\\\\le N} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n^2}{n} for any finite sequence of complex numbers Œª1, ..., ŒªN. Faber polynomials The Grunsky coefficients of a normalized univalent function in z > 1 :g(z)=z+b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots are polynomials in the coefficients bi which can be computed recursively in terms of the Faber polynomials Œ¶n, a monic polynomial of degree n depending on g. Taking the derivative in z of the defining relation of the Grunsky coefficients and multiplying by z gives :\\\\frac{z g'(z)}{g(z) -g(\\\\zeta)} - \\\\frac{z}{z-\\\\zeta} = \\\\sum_{m,n>0} m c_{mn} z^{-m} \\\\zeta^{-n}. The Faber polynomials are defined by the relation :\\\\frac{z g'(z)}{g(z)-w}=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\Phi_n(w) z^{-n}. Dividing this relation by z and integrating between z and ‚àû gives :\\\\log \\\\frac{g(z)-w}{z} =-\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1}{1\\\\over n}\\\\Phi_n(w) z^{-n}. This gives the recurrence relations for n > 0 :\\\\Phi_n(w)= (w-b_0) \\\\Phi_{n-1}(w) -nb_n -\\\\sum_{0\\\\le i \\\\le n-1} b_{n-i} \\\\Phi_{i}(w) with :\\\\Phi_0(w)\\\\equiv 1. Thus :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\Phi_n(g(z))\\\\zeta^{-n} =1+\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\left(z^n +\\\\sum_{m\\\\ge 1} c_{nm}z^{-m}\\\\right)\\\\zeta^{-n}, so that for n ‚â• 1 :\\\\Phi_n(g(z))=z^n + \\\\sum_{m\\\\ge 1} c_{nm}z^{-m}. The latter property uniquely determines the Faber polynomial of g. Milin's area theorem Let g(z) be a univalent function on z > 1 normalized so that : g(z) = z + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots and let f(z) be a non-constant holomorphic function on C. If : f(g(z))=\\\\sum_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty c_n z^n is the Laurent expansion on z > 1, then :\\\\sum_{n>0} nc_n^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{n>0} nc_{-n}^2. Proof If Œ© is a bounded open region with smooth boundary ‚àÇŒ© and h is a differentiable function on Œ© extending to a continuous function on the closure, then, by Stokes' theorem applied to the differential 1-form \\\\omega = h(z) dz, :\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} h(z) \\\\, dz = \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} \\\\omega = \\\\iint_\\\\Omega d\\\\omega = \\\\iint_\\\\Omega (i\\\\partial_x-\\\\partial_y)h \\\\, dx \\\\, dy= 2i \\\\iint_\\\\Omega \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}} h \\\\,dx \\\\, dy. For r > 1, let Œ©r be the complement of the image of z> r under g(z), a bounded domain. Then, by the above identity with h = f‚Ä≤, the area of f(Œ©r) is given by :A(r)=\\\\iint_{\\\\Omega_r} f'(z)^2\\\\, dx \\\\, dy = {1\\\\over 2i}\\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega_r} \\\\overline{f(z)}f'(z) \\\\,dz={1\\\\over 2i}\\\\int_{w=r} \\\\overline{f(g(w)))} f'(g(w)) g'(w)\\\\, dw. Hence :A(r)=\\\\pi \\\\sum_n nc_{-n}^2 r^{2n}. Since the area is non-negative : \\\\sum_{n>0} nc_n^2 r^{-2n} \\\\le \\\\sum_{n>0} n c_{-n}^2 r^{2n}. The result follows by letting r decrease to 1. Milin's proof of Grunsky inequalities If : p(w)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N n^{-1} \\\\lambda_n \\\\Phi_n(w), then :p(g(z))=\\\\left( \\\\sum_{n=1}^N n^{-1}\\\\lambda_n z^n\\\\right) +\\\\left(\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\lambda_n c_{nm}z^{-m}\\\\right). Applying Milin's area theorem, :\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty m\\\\left\\\\sum_{n=1}^N c_{mn}\\\\lambda_n\\\\right^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{n=1}^N {1\\\\over n}\\\\lambda_n^2. (Equality holds here if and only if the complement of the image of g has Lebesgue measure zero.) So a fortiori :\\\\sum_{m=1}^N m\\\\left\\\\sum_{n=1}^N c_{mn}\\\\lambda_n\\\\right^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{n=1}^N {1\\\\over n} \\\\lambda_n^2. Hence the symmetric matrix :a_{mn}= \\\\sqrt{mn} c_{mn}, regarded as an operator on CN with its standard inner product, satisfies :\\\\Ax\\\\\\\\le \\\\x\\\\. So by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality :(Ax,y)\\\\le \\\\x\\\\\\\\cdot\\\\y\\\\. With : x_n= \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n}{\\\\sqrt{n}}=\\\\overline{y_n}, this gives the Grunsky inequality: : \\\\left \\\\sum_{m=1}^N\\\\sum_{n=1}^N c_{mn} \\\\lambda_m\\\\lambda_n\\\\right^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{n=1}^N {1\\\\over n} \\\\lambda_n^2, Criterion for univalence Let g(z) be a holomorphic function on z > 1 with : g(z) = z + b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots Then g is univalent if and only if the Grunsky coefficients of g satisfy the Grunsky inequalities for all N. In fact the conditions have already been shown to be necessary. To see sufficiency, note that : \\\\log {g(z) -g(\\\\zeta)\\\\over z -\\\\zeta}=-\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 1} c_{mn}z^{-m}\\\\zeta^{-n} makes sense when z and Œ∂ are large and hence the coefficients cmn are defined. If the Grunsky inequalities are satisfied then it is easy to see that the cmn are uniformly bounded and hence the expansion on the left hand side converges for z > 1 and Œ∂ > 1. Exponentiating both sides, this implies that g is univalent. Pairs of univalent functions Let F(z) and g(\\\\zeta) be univalent holomorphic functions on z < 1 and Œ∂ > 1, such that their images are disjoint in C. Suppose that these functions are normalized so that :g(\\\\zeta)=\\\\zeta+a_0 + b_1\\\\zeta^{-1} + b_2\\\\zeta^{-2} + \\\\cdots and :F(z)=af(z) with a ‚â† 0 and :f(z) = z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + \\\\cdots. The Grunsky matrix (cmn) of this pair of functions is defined for all non-zero m and n by the formulas: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\log {g(\\\\zeta)-g(\\\\eta)\\\\over \\\\zeta -\\\\eta} &= -\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 1} c_{mn} \\\\zeta^{-m} \\\\eta^{-n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log {g(\\\\zeta) - f(z)\\\\over \\\\zeta} -\\\\log {g(\\\\zeta)\\\\over \\\\zeta} &= -\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 1} c_{-m,n} z^m\\\\zeta^{-n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log {f(z)-f(w)\\\\over z -w} -\\\\log{f(z)\\\\over z} -\\\\log{f(w)\\\\over w} &= -\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 1} c_{-m,-n} z^m w^n \\\\end{align} with :c_{m,-n} =c_{-n,m}, \\\\qquad m,n \\\\ge 1, so that (cmn) is a symmetric matrix. In 1972 the American mathematician James Hummel extended the Grunsky inequalities to this matrix, proving that for any sequence of complex numbers Œª¬±1, ..., Œª¬±N : \\\\left \\\\sum_{n,m e 0} c_{mn}\\\\lambda_m\\\\lambda_n \\\\right  \\\\le \\\\sum_{n e 0} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\lambda_n^2. The proof proceeds by computing the area of the image of the complement of the images of z < r < 1 under F and Œ∂ > R > 1 under g under a suitable Laurent polynomial h(w). Let \\\\phi_{n} and \\\\phi_{-n} denote the Faber polynomials of g and f(z^{-1})^{-1} and set :h(w) =\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n}{n} \\\\Phi_n(w) + \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{-n}}{n} \\\\Phi_{-n}\\\\left (\\\\frac{a}{w}\\\\right ). Then: : \\\\begin{align} h(F(z))&=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{-n}}{n}z^{-n}+\\\\alpha+\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\alpha_n z^n, && z<1, \\\\alpha_n=\\\\sum_m c_{-n,m}\\\\lambda_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ h(g(\\\\zeta))&=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_n}{n} \\\\zeta^n+\\\\beta +\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\beta_n \\\\zeta^{-n}, && \\\\zeta> 1, \\\\beta_n=\\\\sum_m c_{nm} \\\\lambda_m \\\\end{align} The area equals :\\\\int h'(z)^2 \\\\, dx \\\\, dy= \\\\frac{1}{2i}\\\\int_{C_1} \\\\overline{h}(z) h'(z)\\\\, dz -\\\\frac{1}{2i}\\\\int_{C_2} \\\\overline{h}(z) h'(z)\\\\, dz, where C1 is the image of the circle Œ∂ = R under g and C2 is the image of the circle z = r under F. Hence :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\iint h'^2 \\\\, dx \\\\, dy = \\\\left[\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\lambda_{-n}^2 - \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\alpha_n^2 r^{2n} \\\\right ] +\\\\left[\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1}{1\\\\over n}\\\\lambda_n^2 - \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} \\\\beta_n^2 R^{-2n}\\\\right]. Since the area is positive, the right hand side must also be positive. Letting r increase to 1 and R decrease to 1, it follows that :\\\\sum_{m e 0} m \\\\left\\\\sum_{n e 0} c_{mn}\\\\lambda_n\\\\right^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{m e 0} {1\\\\over m} \\\\lambda_m^2 with equality if and only if the complement of the images has Lebesgue measure zero. As in the case of a single function g, this implies the required inequality. Unitarity The matrix : a_{mn}=\\\\sqrt{mn} \\\\cdot c_{mn} of a single function g or a pair of functions F, g is unitary if and only if the complement of the image of g or the union of the images of F and g has Lebesgue measure zero. So, roughly speaking, in the case of one function the image is a slit region in the complex plane; and in the case of two functions the two regions are separated by a closed Jordan curve. In fact the infinite matrix A acting on the Hilbert space of square summable sequences satisfies :A^*A=I, But if J denotes complex conjugation of a sequence, then :JAJ=A^*, \\\\quad JA^*J=A since A is symmetric. Hence :AA^*=JA^*AJ=I so that A is unitary. Equivalent forms of Grunsky inequalities Goluzin inequalities If g(z) is a normalized univalent function in z > 1, z1, ..., zN are distinct points with zn > 1 and Œ±1, ..., Œ±N are complex numbers, the Goluzin inequalities, proved in 1947 by the Russian mathematician Gennadi Mikhailovich Goluzin (1906-1953), state that : \\\\left\\\\sum_{m=1}^N \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_m\\\\alpha_n \\\\log{g(z_m) -g(z_n)\\\\over z_m -z_n}\\\\right^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_{m=1}^N\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_m \\\\overline{\\\\alpha_n} \\\\log {1\\\\over 1-(z_m\\\\overline{z_n})^{-1}}. To deduce them from the Grunsky inequalities, let :\\\\lambda_k=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_n z_n^{-k}. for k > 0. Conversely the Grunsky inequalities follow from the Goluzin inequalities by taking :\\\\alpha_m={1\\\\over N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^N\\\\lambda_n z_n^m. where :z_n=re^{2\\\\pi i n\\\\over N} with r > 1, tending to ‚àû. Bergman‚ÄìSchiffer inequalities gave another derivation of the Grunsky inequalities using reproducing kernels and singular integral operators in geometric function theory; a more recent related approach can be found in . Let f(z) be a normalized univalent function in z < 1, let z1, ..., zN be distinct points with zn < 1 and let Œ±1, ..., Œ±N be complex numbers. The Bergman-Schiffer inequalities state that :\\\\left\\\\sum_{m=1}^N \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_m \\\\alpha_n\\\\left[ \\\\frac{f'(z_m)f'(z_n)}{(f(z_m)-f(z_n))^2} - \\\\frac{1}{(z_m-z_n)^2}\\\\right] \\\\right \\\\le \\\\sum_{m=1}^N \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_m \\\\overline{\\\\alpha_n} \\\\frac{1}{(1-z_m\\\\overline{z_n})^2}. To deduce these inequalities from the Grunsky inequalities, set :\\\\lambda_k=k\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\alpha_n z_n^k. for k > 0. Conversely the Grunsky inequalities follow from the Bergman-Schiffer inequalities by taking :\\\\alpha_m= \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\lambda_n z_n^m. where :z_n=re^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i n}{N}} with r < 1, tending to 0. Applications The Grunsky inequalities imply many inequalities for univalent functions. They were also used by Schiffer and Charzynski in 1960 to give a completely elementary proof of the Bieberbach conjecture for the fourth coefficient; a far more complicated proof had previously been found by Schiffer and Garabedian in 1955. In 1968 Pedersen and Ozawa independently used the Grunsky inequalities to prove the conjecture for the sixth coefficient. In the proof of Schiffer and Charzynski, if :f(x)=z+a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + a_4z^4 + \\\\cdots is a normalized univalent function in z < 1, then :g(z) =f(z^2)^{-1/2}=z + b_1 z^{-1} + b_3 z^{-3} + \\\\cdots is an odd univalent function in z > 1. Combining Gronwall's area theorem for f with the Grunsky inequalities for the first 2 x 2 minor of the Grunsky matrix of g leads to a bound for a4 in terms of a simple function of a2 and a free complex parameter. The free parameter can be chosen so that the bound becomes a function of half the modulus of a2 and it can then be checked directly that this function is no greater than 4 on the range [0,1]. As Milin showed, the Grunsky inequalities can be exponentiated. The simplest case proceeds by writing : \\\\log {g(z)-g(\\\\zeta)\\\\over z-\\\\zeta} = - \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} a_n(\\\\zeta^{-1})z^{-n}. with an(w) holomorphic in w < 1\\\\. The Grunsky inequalities, with Œªn = wn imply that :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} na_n(w)^2 \\\\le - \\\\log (1-w^2). On the other hand, if :\\\\sum_{m\\\\ge 0} b_m t^m = \\\\exp \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} a_n t^n as formal power series, then the first of the Lebedev‚ÄìMilin inequalities (1965) states that Apart from the elementary proof of this result presented here, there are several other analytic proofs in the literature. , following de Branges, notes that it is a consequence of standard inequalities connected with reproducing kernels. observed that it was an immediate consequence of Szeg≈ë's limit formula (1951). Indeed if f is the real-valued trigonometric polynomial on the circle given as twice the real part of a polynomial g(z) vanishing at 0 on the unit disk, Szeg≈ë's limit formula states that the Toeplitz determinants of ef increase to eA where A is the area of g(D). The first determinant is by definition just the constant term in ef = eg2. :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} b_n^2 \\\\le \\\\exp \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 1} n a_n^2. Equivalently the inequality states that if g(z) is a polynomial with g(0) = 0, then :{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^g^2 \\\\, d\\\\theta \\\\le e^A, where A is the area of g(D), To prove the inequality, note that the coefficients are determined by the recursive formula :b_n={1\\\\over n}\\\\sum_{m=1}^n ma_m b_{n-m} so that by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality :b_n^2 \\\\le {1\\\\over n} \\\\sum m^2 a_m^2 b_{n-m}^2. The quantities cn obtained by imposing equality here: :c_n= {1\\\\over n} \\\\sum m^2 a_m^2 c_{n-m} satisfy b_n^2 \\\\le c_n and hence, reversing the steps, :\\\\sum b_n^2 \\\\le \\\\sum c_n = \\\\exp \\\\sum_{m\\\\ge 1} ma_m^2. In particular defining bn(w) by the identity :\\\\sum b_n(\\\\zeta^{-1}) z^{-n} = \\\\exp \\\\sum a_m(\\\\zeta^{-1}) z^{-m} = {g(z)-g(\\\\zeta)\\\\over z-\\\\zeta}, the following inequality must hold for w < 1 :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} b_n(w)^2 \\\\le (1-w^2)^{-1}. Beurling transform The Beurling transform (also called the Beurling- Ahlfors transform and the Hilbert transform in the complex plane) provides one of the most direct methods of proving the Grunsky inequalities, following and . The Beurling transform is defined on L2(C) as the operation of multiplication by z/\\\\overline{z} on Fourier transforms. It thus defines a unitary operator. It can also be defined directly as a principal value integral : (Th)(w)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} -{1\\\\over \\\\pi}\\\\iint_{z-w\\\\ge \\\\varepsilon} {h(z)\\\\over (z-w)^2} \\\\,dx \\\\, dy. For any bounded open region Œ© in C it defines a bounded operator TŒ© from the conjugate of the Bergman space of Œ© onto the Bergman space of Œ©: a square integrable holomorphic function is extended to 0 off Œ© to produce a function in L2(C) to which T is applied and the result restricted to Œ©, where it is holomorphic. If f is a holomorphic univalent map from the unit disk D onto Œ© then the Bergman space of Œ© and its conjugate can be identified with that of D and TŒ© becomes the singular integral operator with kernel :K_f(z,w)= \\\\frac{f'(z)f'(w)}{(f(z)-f(w))^2}. It defines a contraction. On the other hand, it can be checked that TD = 0 by computing directly on powers \\\\overline{z}^n using Stokes theorem to transfer the integral to the boundary. It follows that the operator with kernel :{f'(z)f'(w)\\\\over (f(z)-f(w))^2} - {1\\\\over (z-w)^2}={\\\\partial^2\\\\over\\\\partial z \\\\partial w} \\\\log {f(z) -f(w)\\\\over z-w} =-\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 1} mnc_{mn} z^{m-1}w^{n-1} acts as a contraction on the conjugate of the Bergman space of D. Hence, if : p(z)=\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\overline{z} + \\\\lambda_3 \\\\overline{z}^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_N \\\\overline{z}^{N-1}, then : \\\\sum_{m=1}^N \\\\left\\\\sum_{n=1}^N c_{mn}\\\\lambda_n\\\\right^2=\\\\(T_f-T_z)p\\\\^2 =\\\\T_fp\\\\^2\\\\le \\\\p\\\\^2= \\\\sum_{n=1}^N {1\\\\over n} \\\\lambda_n^2. Grunsky operator and Fredholm determinant If Œ© is a bounded domain in C with smooth boundary, the operator TŒ© can be regarded as a bounded antilinear contractive operator on the Bergman space H = A2(Œ©). It is given by the formula : (T_\\\\Omega u)(z) = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} {1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_{z-w\\\\ge \\\\varepsilon} {\\\\overline{u(z)}\\\\over (z-w)^2} \\\\,\\\\, dx \\\\, dy for u in the Hilbert space H= A2(Œ©). TŒ© is called the Grunsky operator of Œ© (or f). Its realization on D using a univalent function f mapping D onto Œ© and the fact that TD = 0 shows that it is given by restriction of the kernel :\\\\frac{f'(z)f'(w)}{(f(z)-f(w))^2} - \\\\frac{1}{(z-w)^2}, and is therefore a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator. The antilinear operator T = TŒ© satisfies the self- adjointness relation :(Tu,v)=(Tv,u) for u, v in H. Thus A = T2 is a compact self-adjont linear operator on H with :(Au,u)=(Tu,Tu)=\\\\Tu\\\\^2\\\\ge 0, so that A is a positive operator. By the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, there is an orthonormal basis un of H consisting of eigenvectors of A: :Au_n=\\\\mu_n u_n, where Œºn is non-negative by the positivity of A. Hence :\\\\mu_n=\\\\lambda_n^2 with Œªn ‚â• 0. Since T commutes with A, it leaves its eigenspaces invariant. The positivity relation shows that it acts trivially on the zero eigenspace. The other non-zero eigenspaces are all finite-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. Thus an orthonormal basis can be chosen on each eigenspace so that: :Tu_n=\\\\lambda_n u_n. (Note that T(iu_n)=-\\\\lambda_n iu_n by antilinearity of T.) The non-zero Œªn (or sometimes their reciprocals) are called the Fredholm eigenvalues of Œ©: :0\\\\le \\\\lambda_n \\\\le \\\\T\\\\ \\\\le 1. If Œ© is a bounded domain that is not a disk, Ahlfors showed that :\\\\T_\\\\Omega\\\\< 1. The Fredholm determinant for the domain Œ© is defined by :\\\\Delta_\\\\Omega=\\\\det (I- T_\\\\Omega^2) =\\\\prod (1-\\\\lambda_n^2). Note that this makes sense because A = T2 is a trace class operator. showed that if 0\\\\in\\\\Omega and f fixes 0, then :\\\\Delta_\\\\Omega= -\\\\frac{1}{12\\\\pi} \\\\left[ \\\\\\\\partial_z \\\\log f' \\\\^2_D +\\\\\\\\partial_z \\\\log g'\\\\^2_{D^c} - 2 \\\\left \\\\\\\\partial_z\\\\log \\\\frac{f(z)}{z} \\\\right \\\\^2_D - 2 \\\\left \\\\\\\\partial_z\\\\log \\\\frac{g(z)}{z} \\\\right \\\\^2_{D^c}\\\\right]. Here the norms are in the Bergman spaces of D and its complement Dc and g is a univalent map from Dc onto Œ©c fixing ‚àû. A similar formula applies in the case of a pair of univalent functions (see below). Singular integral operators on a closed curve Let Œ© be a bounded simply connected domain in C with smooth boundary C = ‚àÇŒ©. Thus there is a univalent holomorphic map f from the unit disk D onto Œ© extending to a smooth map between the boundaries S1 and C. Notes References   *.

It is one of two proposed solutions for general-purpose computers (the other uses CPU cache for the same purposeThe other has been called frozen cache; the two are similar in using CPU based encryption key storage, but differs in that frozen cache uses CPU cache for the purpose rather than CPU registers. ), was developed from its predecessor AESSE, presented at EuroSec 2010 and presented at USENIX Security 2011. The authors state that it allows RAM to be treated as untrusted from a security viewpoint without hindering the system. A 2012 paper called TRESOR-HUNT showed how a DMA attack can break this system, by injecting code that would invisibly function at ring 0 (the highest privilege level), which would allow it to read the keys and transfer them to usual memory. The paper also proposed ways to mitigate such attacks.  Motivation  In computer security, a common problem for data security is how an intruder can access encrypted data on a computer. Modern encryption algorithms, correctly implemented and with strong passwords, are often unbreakable with current technology, so emphasis has moved to techniques that bypass this requirement, by exploiting aspects of data security where the encryption can be \\"broken\\" with much less effort, or else bypassed completely. A cold boot attack is one such means by which an intruder can defeat encryption despite system security, if they can gain physical access to the running machine. It is premised on the physical properties of the circuitry within memory devices that are commonly used in computers. The concept is that when a computer system has encrypted data open, the encryption keys themselves used to read or write that data are usually stored on a temporary basis in physical memory, in a plain readable form. (Holding these keys in \\"plain\\" form during use is hard or impossible to avoid with usual systems since the system itself must be able to access the data when instructed by the authorized user). Usually this is no benefit to an unauthorised intruder, because they cannot access or use those keys‚Äîfor example due to security built into the software or system. However, if the memory devices can be accessed outside the running system without loss of contents, for example by quickly restarting the computer or removing the devices to a different device, then the current contents‚Äîincluding any encryption keys in use‚Äîcan be plainly read and used. This can be important if the system cannot be used to view, copy or access that data‚Äîfor example the system is locked, or may have booby traps or other intrusion controls, or is needed in a guaranteed untouched form for forensic or evidentiary purposes. Since this is a physical property of the hardware itself, and based on physical properties of memory devices, it cannot be defeated easily by pure software techniques, since all software running in memory at the point of intervention becomes accessible. As a result, any encryption software whose keys could be accessed this way is vulnerable to such attacks. Usually a cold boot attack involves cooling memory chips or quickly restarting the computer, and exploiting the fact that data is not immediately lost (or not lost if power is very quickly restored) and the data that was held at the point of intervention will be left accessible to examination. Cold boot attacks can therefore be a means of unauthorized data theft, loss or access. Such attacks can be nullified if the encryption keys are not accessible at a hardware level to an intruder‚Äìi.e., the devices in which the keys are stored when in use are not amenable to cold boot attacks‚Äìbut this is not the usual case.  TRESOR's approach  TRESOR is a software approach that seeks to resolve this insecurity by storing and manipulating encryption keys almost exclusively on the CPU alone, and in registers accessible at ring 0 (the highest privilege level) only‚Äîthe exception being the brief period of initial calculation at the start of a session. This ensures that encryption keys are almost never available via user space or following a cold boot attack. TRESOR is written as a kernel patch that stores encryption keys in the x86 debug registers, and uses on-the-fly round key generation, atomicity, and blocking of usual access to the debug registers for security. TRESOR was foreshadowed by a 2010 thesis by Tilo Muller which analyzed the cold boot attack issue. He concluded that modern x86 processors had two register areas where CPU-based kernel encryption was realistic: the SSE registers which could in effect be made privileged by disabling all SSE instructions (and necessarily, any programs relying on them), and the debug registers which were much smaller but had no such issues. He left the latter for others to examine, and developed a proof of concept distribution called paranoix based on the SSE register method. Its developers state that \\"running TRESOR on a 64-bit CPU that supports AES-NI, there is no performance penalty compared to a generic implementation of AES\\", and run slightly faster than standard encryption despite the need for key recalculation, a result which initially surprised the authors as well.  Potential vulnerabilities  The authors' paper notes the following: * Although they cannot rule out CPU data leaking into RAM, they were unable to observe any case this happened during formal testing. Any such case is expected to be patchable. * Root access to the encryption keys via the kernel of a running system is possible using loadable kernel modules or virtual memory () and physical memory (), if compiled to support these, but otherwise appears not to be accessible in any known way on a standard running system. * ACPI sleep and low power states: - on real processors registers are reset to zero during ACPI S3 states (suspend-to-ram) and S4 (suspend-to-disk) states since the CPU is switched off for these. * Cold boot attacks on the CPU: - on real processors registers are cleared to zero on both hardware resets and software resets (\\"Ctrl-Alt-Delete\\"). However CPU registers are currently vulnerable on virtual machines, since they are reset during simulated hardware resets but not during software resets. The authors deem this an apparent flaw in many implementations of virtual machines, but note that virtual systems would be inherently vulnerable even if this were rectified, since all registers on a virtual machine are likely to be accessible using the host system. * TRESOR is resistant to timing attacks and cache-based attacks by design of the AES-NI instruction, where the CPU supports AES instruction set extensions.The authors cite Intel: Shay Gueron, Intel Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Instruction Set White Paper, Rev. 3.0: \\"Beyond improving performance, the AES instructions provide important security benefits. By running in data-independent time and not using tables, they help in eliminating the major timing and cache-based attacks that threaten table-based software implementations of AES.\\" Processors capable of handling AES extensions as of 2011 are Intel Westmere and Sandy Bridge (some i3 excepted) and successors, AMD Bulldozer, and certain VIA PadLock processors. * In 2012 a paper called TRESOR-HUNT showed how a DMA attack could break this system, by injecting code that would invisibly function at ring 0 (the highest privilege level), bypassing the \\"lockout\\" imposed by TRESOR, which would allow it to read the keys from the debug registers and transfer them to usual memory. The paper also proposed ways to mitigate such attacks.

The ethos of the paper was marked by the inclusion over the door of images of the Liberal politicians Richard Cobden, William Gladstone and John Bright. With their prominence as leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League (1838‚Äì46) these were suitable subjects for the Liberal newspaper to commemorate.

There are some other magazines affiliated to Elyasin Community such as The Art of Transcendental Life, Art of Living, Esoteric Knowledge, Sublime Thinking, Motivators, and Children News as well, most of which have been shut down or forced to keep a low profile due to the pressures of Iranian Security Service.

Having started her career in print journalism, she moved into broadcasting, working on both radio and television. Her credits include presenting news reports and programmes for BBC News in the United Kingdom, and TV3 News in Ireland, where she was the station's Western Correspondent for several years. After her return to the newspaper industry in early 2012, The Sligo Champion appointed her as its editor in July of that year, making her the first woman to occupy that position. McCudden is the author of Impact: The Human Stories Behind Ireland's Road Tragedies, a book concerning people affected by road fatalities in Ireland, which was later turned into a documentary for TV3, presented by Gay Byrne. She has also written fiction and poetry, having her work published as part of an anthology and in The Irish Times. Career McCudden is from Naas, County Kildare. After studying Journalism and French at Dublin City University she went on to complete an MA in Writing at the National University of Ireland in Galway. Starting as a local reporter she worked for the Westmeath-Offaly Independent in Athlone and Midlands Radio 3 in Tullamore. She later joined the Sunday World, and in 2012 was briefly a reporter with the Irish Sun.https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/news/jenny-mccudden-is- the-new-editor-at-the-sligo-champion-27593378.html With the launch of TV3 in 1998, McCudden was one of the original reporters on the broadcaster's news programme, TV3 News, before later moving to the UK to work at the BBC. Based at various times in both Birmingham and London, she was a producer and reporter for BBC News, but after five years with the Corporation she returned to TV3 News in 2006, where she became their Western Correspondent. She left the broadcaster in 2012, returning to print journalism, and later that year took up the role of editor at The Sligo Champion. In doing so, McCudden became the first woman to edit the newspaper since its foundation in 1836, and the first editor not to have previously been employed there. She wrote her first book, Impact: The Human Stories Behind Ireland's Road Tragedies, after witnessing numerous road traffic accidents throughout her journalistic career: \\"I've been working as a correspondent for TV3 for the past number of years and I come across road fatalities far too regularly. It's in the nature of my job to be at the scene of horrible smashes, often soon after they've happened.\\" The book led to controversy following an edition of RT√â One's The Late Late Show in February 2010 in which her TV3 colleagues perceived she had been snubbed by Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â) because she was employed by a rival broadcaster. McCudden was in the audience, and her book was mentioned by host Ryan Tubridy following a segment about drink driving, but her presence itself was ignored. However, speaking to the Evening Herald some days later, she dismissed claims of broadcaster rivalry: \\"He [Ryan Tubridy] mentioned my name, the book's name and the publishers at least three times. I have no issues with Ryan. The aim of the book is to save lives, which is much more important in the bigger picture.\\" In March 2010, McCudden worked with veteran broadcaster and television presenter Gay Byrne on a TV3 documentary based on her book. The two-part programme, Impact: Tragedy on Irish Roads was aired by the channel in March 2010. The film featured interviews with the relatives of people killed in road traffic accidents, as well as some of those who had survived. Byrne, who is chair of the Road Safety Authority was keen to present the programme after McCudden sent him a copy of her book and TV3 decided to make the documentary. News of her collaboration with Byrne inspired an edition of the satirical My Week column, a feature in The Times written in the form of a fictional diary detailing her experience. It appeared on 6 March 2010. She has also written fiction and poetry, contributing some of her work to Three Times Daily, an anthology of short fiction and poetry published in 2010. One of her stories, titled \\"Fallow\\", was published in The Irish Times in December 2011. She was a featured reader at the 2009 C√∫irt International Festival of Literature.

History Origin The Juchesasangpa was in part a reaction to Park Chung-hee's Yushin Constitution, which gave Park authoritarian powers. The fall of the Soviet Union and anti- communist laws in South Korea have had‚Äîand continue to have‚Äîa negative effect on the perception of Juche ideology in South Korea. However, after constitutional democracy was established after mass demonstrations in 1987, the Juchesasanpa died out as radicals were replaced with more centrist ideologues. Criticism Certain leftist movements in South Korea are often referred to as \\"chinbuk\\" (pro-North), \\"Jongbuk\\" (pursuant to North) and \\"Jusapa\\" (Juche proponent) by Korean conservatives, anti-communists and others critical of the North. This perception is reinforced by cases such as Lim Su- kyung's, best known for attending the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, held in North Korea and praising President of North Korea Kim Il Sung in 1989, without first obtaining permission from the South Korean government. She attended the festival representing the student organization Jeondaehyop, now known as Hanchongryun, who in April 2012 was elected as a member of the 19th National Assembly as the Democratic United Party's 21st proportional representative. In June 2012, in a confrontation with a North Korean defector in a bar, Lim hurled insults and referred to a ruling party lawmaker as a \\"son-of-a-bitch betrayer\\" and another as a \\"traitor\\" in what has been described by Korea JoonAng Daily as \\"an alcohol-fueled tirade at a Seoul restaurant\\", questioning their legitimacy to challenge her as a lawmaker. This led to public protests.

The South West Coast Path runs through the SSSI. Geography The site, notified in 1977, is located on the western coast of Cornwall, south of Land's End. It starts in the south at the settlement of Porthgwarra and continues north along the coast of the last sections of the English Channel to Pordenack Point in the north.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Other designations are part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a Geological Conservation Review site, part of the Penwith Heritage coast, Nature Conservation Reviewsite and there are Scheduled Ancient Monuments within the area. Wildlife and ecology Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is designated for its vegetation of waved maritime heath, and for being of considerable ornithological interest; especially for passage migrants. The southern section, Tol Pedn or Gwennap Head, in particular is favoured by birdwatchers and many travel the length and breadth of Britain to track rare seabirds. The headland is renowned for its relative abundance of passing marine bird species with many common species such as northern gannet (Morus bassanus), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), common guillemot, (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). Forty-five breeding species have been recorded including the red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) which have recently been breeding successfully on Gwennap Head, but lost their young to a predator in early May 2015. Other species include Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), which is a rare as a breeding bird in Cornwall and European stonechat (Saxicola rubicola) and common whitethroat (Sylvia communis). Resident butterflies include the silver studded blue (Plebejus argus), large white (Pieris brassicae), small copper (Lycaena phlaeas), common blue (Polyommatus icarus), small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae), peacock (Aglais io), comma (Polygonia c-album), small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and wall (Lasiommata megera). Some insects also migrate and butterflies often seen include clouded yellow (Colias croceus), red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui). Migrant moths include rush veneer (Nomophila noctuella), rusty-dot pearl (Udea ferrugalis), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum) and silver Y (Autographa gamma). In 2010 perennial centaury (Centaurium scilloides), a national rarity, was refound by Helen and Laurie Oakes. Despite many searches by botanists the species had not been seen in Cornwall (and England) since 1962 (or possibly 1967), and survived on only one Welsh site; coastal footpaths of Pembrokeshire National Park, Wales.

The ambush resulted in the deaths of all three IRA men involved. Background In May 1987, an eight-man unit of the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade was ambushed and shot dead by a Special Air Service (SAS) during an attack by them on a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) rural police station at the village of Loughgall, County Armagh. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident during its campaign.Murray, Raymond (1990). The SAS in Ireland. Mercier Press, p. 380; Despite this major setback, IRA activity in East Tyrone didn't lessen in the following years.Urban, Mark (1992). Big Boys' Rules.

British intelligence sources claimed the men were involved in the Ballygawley bus bombing, which killed eight British soldiers and injured 28, which resulted in the British Army changing its troop transportation methods in East Tyrone, switching from using unarmoured vehicular transport coaches on country roads, to ferrying them in and out of its bases in the district using helicopters.Bijl, Nick van der (2009). Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969 to 2007. Pen & Sword Military, p. 179; Tit-for-tat killings in East Tyrone The series of killings which led to the Coagh ambush began on 26 April 1988, when a 23-year-old UDR soldier from Coagh, Edward Gibson, was shot dead by an IRA unit at Ardboe whilst at work for Cookstown Council on a bin lorry.Toolis, p. 57 Off-duty UDR soldiers, who tended to be Protestants, were common targets of the IRA in County Tyrone. These attacks fostered a perception among some in the Protestant community that the IRA was waging an ethnic war against them.Toolis, p. 60 The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) retaliated by murdering Phelim McNally (brother of local Sinn F√©in councillor Francie McNally) on 24 November 1988.Toolis, p. 61 This was followed by an IRA attack upon a car maintenance garage business owned by a retired UDR soldier called Leslie Dallas on 7 March 1989, in which Dallas, along with two civilian pensioners that were attending the premises at the time of the attack, were all murdered by machine-gun fire from a passing vehicle, the IRA attackers driving off afterwards cheering as reported by eye- witnesses in the vicinity. The IRA, announcing responsibility for the attack afterwards stated that Dallas was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force.McKittrick, pp. 1164‚Äì65Palace Barracks Memorial Garden A subsequent RUC and coroner's inquest found that Dallas had no discernible links with the UVF; and local residents later stated that he had been targeted on the basis of his former service with the British Army, and the fact of his being a prominent member of the Orange Order in the town. The tit-for-tat campaign around Coagh continued on 29 November 1989, when UVF gunmen attacked a pub owned by IRA member Liam Ryan, shooting Ryan dead; a customer in the premises was also killed in the incident.Toolis, p. 66 On 8 March 1990, part-time UDR soldier and construction worker Thomas Jamison was killed by the IRA in a gun and grenade ambush attack on a lorry he was driving near Donaghmore, whilst delivering concrete to a British Army base.McKittrick, David (1999). Lost lives. Mainstream, p. 1193; Toolis, p. 70 Jamison was an employee of 'Henry Brothers', a building firm that had a contract with the British Government for constructing police and armed forces' instillations. Harold Henry, one of the two brothers who owned the company, had been murdered by the IRA in 1987 in The Loup, County Londonderry.Toolis, pp. 55-56 On 3 March 1991, the Ulster Volunteer Force carried out an attack at the village of Cappagh, killing three IRA members. The IRA subsequently stated its belief that this attack could have been carried out only with the connivance of the British state forces.Toolis, p. 72 On 9 April 1991, the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade shot dead Derek Ferguson in Coagh (a cousin of local Member of Parliament Reverend William McCrea), stating afterward that he was a paramilitary with the Ulster Volunteer Force. Ferguson's family subsequently refuted that he had anything to do with Loyalist paramilitarism. Historian Kevin Toolis includes as part of this cycle of violence the destruction of Glenanne UDR barracks in nearby County Armagh, in which three soldiers were killed and 10 injured by an IRA truck bomb on 30 May.Toolis, p. 73 The IRA later claimed the killings of 3 of its members that followed in Coagh was a retaliation by the British Army for the Glenanne bombing.Summers, Chris (2009). \\"The SAS broke the rules of war\\", bbc.co.uk, 28 January 2009; accessed 5 May 2014.

Brits: the war against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 305; In consequence a detachment from the British Army's Special Air Service was lying in wait for Doris, Ryan and McNally on both sides of Coagh's main street,Toolis, p. 74 and also in a red Bedford lorry at the scene. The stolen car was driven by Doris towards the centre of the village,Toolis, p. 28 its journey from Moneymore being tracked on the ground and in the air. At the scene of the ambush the British Army had set up a \\"decoy\\" target for the IRA to go for in the form of an SAS trooper who was pretending to be their intended victim, sitting in his car at a regular spot while waiting to pick up a friend on their way to work, which IRA intelligence had established the behavioral pattern of. When the stolen car carrying the IRA men approached the scene the Special Air Service detachment opened sustained automatic fire upon it from close range. Doris was immediately hit, and the out-of-control car crashed into two nearby parked cars. The shooting continued until the car exploded in flames and set one of the parked vehicles it had crashed into alight.MacThom√°is, Shane (2005). \\"Three Volunteers killed in Coagh\\" , saoirse32.blogsome.com, 27 May 2005; accessed 4 May 2014.

Relatives of the IRA men subsequently stated that they had received information from the scene that two of the IRA attackers had fled on foot from the car after the crash, but had been pursued after and shot down by the British Army in the vicinity, with their bodies being taken back to the car, which was subsequently reported to be riddled with over 200 bullet holes. A Royal Ulster Constabulary crime-scene report stated that a balaclava belonging to one of the IRA men was found some distance away from the vehicle. The bodies of Doris, Ryan and McNally were badly burnt by the car fire, and had to be identified by police using their dental records. Two rifles were recovered from within the burnt-out stolen car, subsequent police forensic examination of them revealing that they had both been used in the multiple murders at Leslie Dallas's garage (see above) in March 1989. Subsequent events Local Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician William McCrea ‚Äì cousin of Derek Ferguson, killed by the IRA on 9 April ‚Äì declared that \\"(the IRA men involved) had fallen into the pit they planned for others....

The IRA unit was involved at the time in a gun battle with a Green Jackets observation post deployed in the area, and the helicopter was sent in to support the ground troops. The helicopter crashed after the pilot lost control of the aircraft whilst evading ground fire. Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Douglas Corden-Lloyd, 2nd Battalion Green Jackets commanding officer, died in the crash. The incident was overshadowed in the press by the La Mon restaurant bombing, which took place just hours later near Belfast.  Background  By early 1978, the British Army forces involved in Operation Banner had recently replaced their ageing Bell H-13 Sioux helicopters for the more versatile A√©rospatiale Gazelles. The introduction of the new machines increased the area covered on a reconnaissance sortie as well as the improved time spent in airborne missions.Gazelle ‚Äì Thoroughbred racer Soldier's magazine, February 1978 In the same period, the Provisional IRA received its first consignment of M60 machine guns from the Middle East, which were displayed by masked volunteers during a Bloody Sunday commemoration in Derry.O'Ballance, Edgard (1981). Terror in Ireland: the heritage of hate. Presidio Press, p. 227. Faligot, Roger (1983). Britain's military strategy in Ireland: the Kitson experiment. Zed Press, p.155. Airborne operations were crucial for the British presence along the border, especially in south County Armagh, where the level of IRA activity meant that every supply and soldier had to be ferried in and out of their bases by helicopter since 1975.\\"Since the mid-1970s virtually all military movement has been by helicopter to avoid casualties from landmines planted under the roads; even the rubbish from the security forces bases is taken away by air.\\" Harnden, p. 19 The Royal Green Jackets had been in South Armagh since December 1977, and had already seen some action.Dewar p. 154 Just a few days after arrival, two mortar rounds hit the C Company base at Forkhill, injuring a number of soldiers. In the aftermath of the attack, two Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers were wounded while recovering the lorry where the mortar tubes were mounted.Barzilay, p. 177 Two days later, a patrol near the border suffered a bomb and gun attack, leaving the commanding sergeant with severe head wounds. The sergeant was picked up from the scene by helicopter. He was later invalided from the British Army as a result of his injuries. Shooting and crash On 17 January 1978, a Green Jackets observation post deployed around the village of Jonesborough began to take heavy fire from the \\"March Wall\\", which drew parallel with the Irish border to the east, along the Dromad woods. The soldiers returned fire, but the short distance to the border and the open ground prevented them from advancing. The Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd, along with Captain Schofield and Sergeant Ives flew from the battalion base at Bessbrook Mill to assess the situation and provide information to the troops. While hovering over the scene of the engagement, the pilot lost control of the aircraft during a turn at high speed to avoid the ground fire. The Gazelle (serial number XX404) hit a wall and crashed on a field, some 2 km from Jonesborough. Corden-Lloyd was killed and the other two passengers were wounded. The machine came to rest on its right side. The pilot remained trapped inside the wreckage, but he survived thanks to his helmet.UK Military Aircraft Losses ‚Äì 1978 The IRA claimed they had shot at the helicopter with an M60 machine gun.Newsweek, Volume 91, Issues 1‚Äì9.

The original French albums were published by Gallimard between 2005 and 2010. All six volumes have been translated into English by Drawn & Quarterly. Although not entirely autobiographical, the story is based on the author's life in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Aya of Yop City is the second of three books in the Abouet's Aya series, each based on the same characters. All three of the books in the series have been illustrated by the author's husband, Cl√©ment Oubrerie. It has been adapted into an animated film in 2012 by the same authors.  Background  Origin of Aya of Yop City Marguerite Abouet was working as a legal assistant in Paris when she conceived the idea of Aya of Yop City. Frustrated with the limitations of the young adult fiction market, Abouet set out to do something different. During this time, she was inspired to create the series from her friends, who were encouraging her to write stories from her childhood in C√¥te d'Ivoire, her native country. It was then that she conceived the idea of telling the story of a group of Ivorian teenagers' everyday lives. Later, Cl√©ment Oubrerie, established animator, artist and children's book illustrator, gained interest in the project, and it eventually became the first graphic novel for both artists. Inspired by French graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi, Abouet has created a story that depicts the normality of life in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Although Abouet has denied that the stories are based on her own life, she admits it is strongly based on people in her childhood in C√¥te d'Ivoire. The quotidian nature of the stories in Aya of Yop City counters heavily with common conceptions and representation of African life, such as famine, civil war and unhinged wilderness. Abouet's depiction of everyday African life through humor gave western viewers a very different viewpoint of Africa that they are not accustomed to seeing. Through this depiction, Aya of Yop City subverts negative stereotypes that plague C√¥te d'Ivoire and Africa in general.  Plot summary  Aya of Yop City is a novel that follows the lives of many different people living in the C√¥te d'Ivoire. All of the characters are connected by the main character, Aya, as she assists and helps them through their various dilemmas and daily issues. The book begins with the birth of the son of Moussa and Adjoua. The wedding between Moussa and Adjoua is canceled when they discover the child is not Moussa's. He begins to work for his father. His father seems to be very hard on him, but at the same time Moussa is extremely lazy and does not really do much. At work he tends to hit on the women workers, and is always being yelled at by his father. All the while Adjoua is selling fritters at the market trying to provide for her son. Aya takes care of Adjoua's son the majority of the time and is always helping Adjoua while trying to keep up with her schoolwork at the same time. While this is occurring, Aya's friend Bintou begins seeing a Parisian man named Gregoire. Another character in the story, Herve, goes to Aya for help. He works fixing cars and is going to end up taking over the business since the owner is sick. However, he does not know how to read and write. It is because of this that he goes to Aya and asks her if she is able to teach him about letters. Aya agrees, as she is always helping out her friends and family. Nevertheless, Aya also has some problems of her own - a secret her father Ignace has been hiding for a long time has the power to destroy her family.  Cultural history  Aya of Yop City is set in C√¥te d'Ivoire during the 1970s. Specifically, the story takes place in Yopougon-Koute, or Yop City for short. C√¥te d'Ivoire, a country on the west coast of Africa, was colonized by France until August 7, 1960 when the country received its independence. F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny led the country after gaining independence until 1993. During this time, C√¥te d'Ivoire kept close ties with its West African neighbors as well as ties to France. This combination of influences created a unique culture where traditional African culture meshed with modern Western ideals. The post-colonial influence was enhanced by the fact that many Europeans, especially the French, moved to the country after they received independence. When Houphou√´t-Boigny took the presidency, the country experienced an economic boom, known as the \\"Ivorian miracle\\". This boom led to the creation of the middle class. With this rise in wealth for a portion of the country, many were able to send their children to school, especially peasants.Abouet, Marguerite. \\"Drawing on the Universal in Africa.\\" Aya of Yop City. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008. Print. A peak in the primary-school enrollment rates, at 9.1% between 1976 and 1980, reflects this change. Education, along with other social influences, made many, mostly women, aware of their rights. This began to mix African ideals with European ideals. Women began fighting back against legislation which was aimed at sexual inequality and often succeeded in doing so. As many women became educated, they received more and more power when it came to relationships, especially marriages. Another example of the combination of cultures is language. Throughout the country there are many local languages, but the official language of the country is French. Again, these influences can be seen throughout the novel, especially through the female characters. Major themes ;Advancement of women in society Aya is different than the other women in Yop City because of her dismissal of the task of finding a husband. She is completely uninterested in men and would rather take care of Bobby and work towards her future. She is a very driven and independent, which is certainly highlighted throughout the novel. On the other hand, the other women in the novel do not seem to be as concerned as Aya with changing their roles in society through pursuing an education and a professional level career. Rather they are more predisposed to the typical women's role in Yop City of staying home to raise a family. Aya nevertheless sets a good example and high standard, as she aspires to be a doctor one day. Aya represents the push towards raising the standards of women's contributions to the community, rather than staying consistent with the historical gender role in Yop City, as displayed by the other women. ;Honesty and loyalty Many of the characters face problems with infidelity and dishonesty in their narratives‚Äîwhether they are the perpetrators or the victims, their paths eventually cross in more ways than one, often not in good ways (in the sense that they are often manipulated by or manipulating each other). Aya contradicts this best, being the emblem of loyalty and honesty in the novel. ;Family and community Within the first page of Aya of Yop City, the family units are mapped out, laying the groundwork for the strong family ties and connections throughout the novel. These initial family trees let the reader know immediately that family ties are going to be an important force in the community. Within each scene multiple community members from each of the families interact, showing they are ever present in each other's lives. The close connections between the different characters gives the reader the sense that this community has always been tightly knit. Aya best portrays this sense of community through her relationships with others. She performs many favors for her friends, most notably taking care of Bobby as if he was her own. From living in the same area to getting involved in the family business, as Moussa did, the people of Yop City truly value the family unit.  Analysis  Origin of Nationalism in Africa The colonial era in Africa created loosely formed states that contained many different ethnic groups that maintained strong communal values. In the post-colonial era, it became evident that African nations would need to unite in order to form permanent states and establish national governments. This re-branded type of nationalism was created through a collaboration of ideas stemming from traditional communal ties already in existence on the continent, and by the idea of self- determination that was championed by the United Nations. Together, these concepts assisted in the creation of sovereign states in Africa. African Communal Identity in the Novel The novel Aya of Yop City encompasses an overall theme of African nationalism, which is exhibited through familial and communal ties within the Ivorian community. Communalism is argued to be a form of nationalism that is unique to Africa because of the continent's history with colonialism. This communal idea of nationalism serves a different purpose than the Eurocentric norm, in that it is focused on obtaining a collective identity that speaks to the shared history of the African people living in a post-colonial era. For example, the characters in the book are not introduced individually, but rather as family members that play complementary roles. This shows how a distinct identity is formed for the dwellers of Yop city, as they navigate their lives in a post- colonial society. The problems that are usually seen as individual or family issues become community-wide issues. For instance, when Adjoua, a teenage girl in the novel, becomes pregnant the community rallies behind her to offer support. Aya watches after Adjoua's child so that she can continue selling items at the market to support her family. This illustrates the strong communal identity that binds the inhabitants of Yop City together. Artistic Style Cl√©ment Oubrerie uses an expressive style that conveys the melodramatic tone of the text. His pencil strokes often go a step beyond reality to express strong emotions and to give his characters a distinct personality. For example, Bonaventure Sissoko is caricatured as a bully archetype: his eyes are completely masked by his bushy eyebrows and his huge bald head is attached directly unto his massive body. This exaggeration technique is used for comic effect and it also gives the readers an immediate impression of Bonaventure's obnoxious personality . In contrast, Oubrerie's settings are very realistic. He uses a great amount of detail in his backgrounds to depict with accuracy the social and economic environment of post-colonial Ivory Coast in the 70's. Every scene, from the modern Ivorian cityscape to the small-town marketplace, is drawn in minute detail and vibrant colors that give the readers an immersive experience. In addition, Oubrerie's detailed settings help to establish characterization in the story. For example, Bonaventure's pink mansion stands out from all the other houses like a sore thumb in the same way that his body towers over the other characters.  Character list  *Aya - The protagonist of the book, Aya is a sweet and humble girl who is connected to every character in some way. Aya helps out the entire community in several ways. She is supportive of her friends and family and is always willing to help others.

He is very persistent about confirming that Bobby is Moussa's son. Hyacinte was outraged to find out the Mamadou was the actual father, when he was working so hard to prove some type of family connection between Moussa and Bobby. Hyacinte abandons Adjoua after being disappointed that her child was not the heir to Moussa's fortune. *Korotoumou - Adjoua's mother. She was outraged as well to find out that Moussa was not the father. It served as a disappointment to the entire family and an embarrassment in the community. *Albert - Adjoua's brother.

Mamadou is referred to as a skirt chaser because he is known to sleep around the city.

It was published by Interlink World Fiction in 2005, and won the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa. Throughout the novel the main character, Enitan, is faced with various personal entanglements connected with family troubles, rape, cheating boyfriends, and imprisonment. The novel is also a biting commentary on post-independence governments in Nigeria and tensions between Igbo (Biafrans), Yoruba, and Hausa ethnic groups after the Biafran War. Plot summary Everything Good Will Come is a bildungsroman that tells the story of Enitan, a young Nigerian woman growing up in her native homeland coping with the demands of the patriarchal society that encompasses her. Enitan is raised in a divided home struggling to identify herself in the midst of her mother's strong religious beliefs and her father's manipulative political ways. Due to her being an only child and the death of her brother, her parents have strict demands that restrict her from having a normal childhood. Her rebellious nature is first seen when she defies her mother's wishes and leaves the house on Sundays to play with the girl next door, Sheri, who is considered \\"yellow\\" because her father is Muslim and her mother is a white English woman. Sheri is a sassy young girl sassy with a rebellious nature, constantly testing those around her, while craving the attention of any male. Their friendship builds as they continue to defy Enitan's mother by seeing each other. The girls are soon forced to separate; Enitan is sent to a school abroad to receive a better education than that offered in Lagos. Her father, an educated lawyer, wants the best for her and hopes she will take over his firm once she has finished school and proves herself as a lawyer. Sheri and Enitan keep in touch, writing letters back and forth about school, boys, and when they will meet again. During a holiday visit home, Enitan and Sheri meet up and go to a party. Enitan, who doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable in the situation, wants to leave. On her way out, she witnesses the three men pinning Sheri down raping her and bruising her body as they degrade her. The image of Sheri's rape affects Enitan's ability to allow herself to trust men. The aftermath of Sheri's rape leads to a partial termination of their friendship and Sheri being sent to the hospital due to an attempt to give herself an abortion. Years pass and Enitan returns to Lagos to stay with her father and work under him to start her career as a lawyer. She begins dating a struggling artist, Mike, and has an emotionally complex but short-lived relationship with him. Enitan runs into Sheri one afternoon and reconnects with her. Sheri is a mistress to a Muslim brigadier, who pays for her living and gives Sheri a good life. Sheri believes in playing the system rather than settling down with a man because she is aware of the lack of individualism a woman receives once she becomes married in their society. Enitan gradually becomes closer with a man called Niyi Franco, who is separated from his only child who was taken away by his ex-wife when they moved to Britain. This relationship quickly becomes a marriage. Enitan at first feels comfort and safety in Niyi's arms, but their relationship is soon tested when she refuses to submit to his demanding ways and struggles to conceive and carry a child. After she becomes pregnant, Niyi and Enitan's differences over each other's behavior and expectations build. In addition to the stress from her failing marriage, her father's political outspokenness and subsequent arrest forces her into activism and results in a night in jail. Enitan joins a group of women in the fight against the government for women's rights during her pregnancy. Her drive for change is frowned upon by her husband, who wants her to stay at home and take on \\"women-like\\" tasks. Niyi's lack of support for his wife's beliefs, along with her unwillingness to concede to his requests, leads to their separation. Enitan continues to stand up for what she believe: wanting women to have the ability to choose whether or not they will be submissive in society with hopes for individuality. Characters Enitan Enitan is the main female character that the story follows. The novel starts when she is a little girl and meets Sheri for the first time. The story progresses along with Enitan's life. In the beginning Enitan witnesses the rape of her friend Sheri, which causes Enitan to withdraw from Sheri. Throughout her life, Enitan's father, and later her husband Niyi, encourages her to stand up for herself. This causes her to always speak her mind when it comes to her rights even in the face of adversity. The political changes in her country affect Enitan's life in many different ways. First, she comes home from college and has to go through military training and later she has to deal with gas shortages, being stopped on the roadside by soldiers, her father's and her own arrest. As she grows she comes to realize that she has lived a privileged life even though she has had to deal with the stigma of being a woman in Nigeria. She also finds out that she has a brother while her father is in prison. Although they become friendly with each other, this just reinforces the fact that Enitan cannot trust any of the men in her life to treat a woman with respect or as an equal. Enitan is a strong female lead in the novel who fights the traditional male dominant culture that she lives in. She is the example of the Nigerian woman who is educated and fights for the nice life that she has lived. Her own time in jail shows Enitan for the reality of how the people in her country, specifically the woman, are being treated by the people on power. At the end of the novel she breaks tradition and leaves her husband to lead a group of women fighting for the release of political prisoners. Sheri Sheri is also a part of the story from the very beginning. Her life is hugely affected by her rape in the beginning of the novel. When she became pregnant after the rape she aborted her baby with a clothes hanger, making herself barren in the process. To a Nigerian woman being barren is the worst thing that a woman could be and being able to have children is the major value of a woman which Sheri has now lost. She also grows up in a family with more than one wife. She has always seen firsthand the more traditional side of her culture which certainly influences her decision to live as a mistress in order to survive. When Sheri and Enitan meet again after Enitan comes home from England Sheri is the mistress of the Brigadier. Up until this point Sheri is the other type of woman in Nigeria: the one who depends on a man. In exchange for an easier lifestyle, she plays the role of housewife and does all of the cooking, cleaning, and care of her man. Sheri knows how to take advantage of the fact that men often stray from their marriages in Nigeria and it is even considered normal to have more than one wife or women on the side. Enitan gives Sheri the idea of a catering business, which she puts into motion when the Brigadier hits her. This enables Sheri and her family to take care of themselves without being supported by a man. Sheri and Enitan are very important characters because they show the contrast between the two ways that a woman can survive in Nigeria. She is also a character who is deprived of motherly care and the privilege to experience the joys of motherhood. She is often referred to as a strong person by Enitan. Sunny and Enitan's mother Sunny is Enitan's father and he is the person who starts her thoughts of fighting for her rights. In her childhood, Sunny tells his daughter not to worry about learning how to cook because he says that girls don‚Äôt need to learn that in her generation. He fills her head with such ideas but later when she grows up and uses his lessons against him he reverts to being a sexist male. Sunny expects Enitan to stand up for herself except when it comes to himself: everything he says is supposed to be right regardless of logic. Sunny's character shows how hard it is to escape the traditional mindset that the males in Nigerian culture have the final word regardless of what the women think. Enitan's mother starts out as the villain of the story and later turns out to be a victim of society. While married to Sunny, she is constantly ridiculed for her beliefs and actions and seems psychotic with her part in the church. Later in the novel Enitan's mother is a woman who tried everything to save her son and breaks down when nothing can be done. Enitan brings her mother back into her life when she realizes that Sunny believes in the traditional roles of man and woman, which is the same reason that Enitan's mother leaves Sunny early in the story. Enitan learns to relate to her mother because as women they are both subject to the demands of the men in their life until they separate from those men. Enitan's parents are important to the story because as time goes on the reader learns how their marriage fell apart and how this affects Enitan. Niyi Niyi is Enitan's husband with whom she later has a child. At the beginning of their relationship Niyi is just like her father and tells her to stand up for her rights when the men at her job try to take advantage of her in a work-related way. Up until Enitan gets pregnant everything seems all right with their relationship even though Niyi acts like a child that Enitan has to take care of instead of a grown man. Soon Niyi expects Enitan to obey him and while his concern is for the unborn baby he also cannot handle the fact that Enitan does things that he tells her not to do. Niyi doesn‚Äôt want Enitan to draw interest from the government when her father is arrested but she gets arrested herself when she gets involved with Grace Ameh, who Niyi also doesn‚Äôt want Enitan to be involved with. Niyi only helps take care of Enitan when their situation is at an extreme and the baby is in danger after Enitan's mother dies. Unfortunately for him, this shows that Niyi has always been capable of helping out around the house and cleaning up after himself and instead let Enitan do everything. This contributes to their divorce but the major reason is that Niyi refuses to support Enitan's interest helping women prisoners. Grace Ameh Grace is the reason that Enitan is able to get more information about her father and she influences Enitan to put herself in danger. Enitan is arrested because she is attending a reading that Grace is a part of and both women are taken to prison where Enitan sees firsthand the treatment that women and prisoners in general. Grace also invites her to the group of women who campaign for prisoners and this is the group that Enitan leaves her husband for which he won‚Äôt support her interest in. Mike is the first man whom Enitan really likes when she comes back to Nigeria from college and he treats her well. After she fights with her father about his son, Debayo Taiwo, she leaves her father's house for Mike's and finds him with another woman. This is an early example for her of how the men in her life cannot be relied upon and only think of themselves. Most of the men in her life, her husband and father especially, tell her to be a strong woman and to stand up for herself except when it comes to them. Nigerian culture and history Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups and over 50 languages. However, the three most dominant tribes in the country are Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo. The Hausa dominate the northern region of Nigeria, the Yoruba dominate the southwestern region, and the Igbo dominate the southeastern region. Religious differences also endorse the strong divide between different regions of Nigeria. The Hausa are predominantly Muslim. The Igbo are mostly Catholic Christians, and Yorubas are split between Christians of various denominations and Muslims. The different tribes of Nigeria operated as separate states with little interactions with each other until its unification and colonization by Great Britain in 1914. During the colonization of Nigeria by Great Britain, local tribes were used to govern their regions and the British government served as the central power. The Hausa excelled in the military field and made up most of the colony's military forces. Since the trade capitals and oil reserves of Nigeria are located in the south, the Yoruba and Igbo naturally excelled in education and trades. The balance of power was well-regulated by the British so there were little ethnic conflicts. After Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the balance of power was maintained through elections and a democratic approach to all national issues. However, the situation became volatile with back-to-back military coups that were led mostly by corrupt Hausa military officers. The coups also generated ethnic violence between the different groups and tension was high. In an attempt to rule its own region, the Igbo declared themselves independent from Nigeria, and named the southeastern region of the nation Biafra. But since most of Nigeria's valuable natural resources lay in the new \\"Biafra\\", Nigeria refused to recognize the newly formed country, which led to war between Nigeria and Biafra. The war lasted from 1967 to 1970, claiming about 3 million civilian and military casualties. At the end, the Biafran state was eradicated and discontinued. This is why \\"Biafra\\" carries a negative connotation in the book. Currently, all tribes of Nigeria are functioning in a cooperative manner though underlying tension still strains the relationship. Although members of the different tribes interact freely all over the nation and equally share political powers, the clear division among tribes leads to civil unrest and rebellion. Enitan and her father spent time in prison due to their rebellion. Political unrest and religion Other important themes in Everything Good Will Come include political unrest and religion. Throughout the book, which covers many years, political unrest is present and, though it is not explicitly said, much of this conflict has to do with religion and the distribution of wealth and power. The book is set mainly before and during the Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì70) or the \\"Nigerian-Biafran War\\". The main character and her family are Yoruba. At the beginning of the novel we see how different characters view the war and react to it. The main character Enitan's father, Sunny, is a lawyer and has two fellow lawyers as friends. Enitan describes how they were so close they considered themselves, when they were studying at Cambridge together, the \\"Three Musketeers\\" in the heart of darkness. When the war starts we see how the allegiance of these friends are divided. One joins the Biafran side out of fear and is killed. Another supports and encourages the Yoruba movement, while Sunny seems to quietly support it. Later in the novel when Enitan is in law school in Britain she hears of all the political unrest still in her country although the war ended in the '70s. She talks about how people are being imprisoned without charge, the suspension of the constitution all by the military regimes that had taken over Nigeria in order to enforce peace and discipline in the country. When she returns to Nigeria she realizes her father has become politically involved, is imprisonment and, despite the objections of her husband, so does she. In the Yoruba and Igbo tribes in the eastern parts of Nigeria Christianity is the dominate religion because of the early and quick success of the Christian missionaries when they arrived; construction of Anglican and other Christian churches followed. Enitan's mother, Mama Enitan, is a devout Anglican. Throughout the story Enitan describes her perception of the ways and beliefs of her mother's church. Sunny uses his wife's religion as a way to belittle her, call her crazy and endanger Enitan's life, which, at times is not completely false. Yet, the importance of religion to Mama Enitan is strong as she has lost her son to disease, suffers through a bad marriage and is subject to the dual pressure put on all the Nigerian women that result from colonization and sexist societal attitudes; she turns to religion as one would self-medicate with drugs, alcohol or sexual activity as an escape from reality. Significance The significance of Everything Good Will Come lies within the historical perspective Sefi Atta uses to look at her character's life. By being based in a true Nigerian culture and political atmosphere, this fictional story has relevance to the time period in which it is set. This relation between fact and fiction gives the reader insight to how likely and the effect politics could play a role within each character's life. Although the focus is on the middle and upper classes, the unsettled government of the 1970s through 1990s is still well represented. The history of this novel follows Nigeria through a civil war and into the Second and Third Republic, all times of different political powers but connected through the character's lives. The author also has credibility for writing about this time period because much of her life experiences paralleled those of Enitan. Born in 1964, Sefi Atta was only seven years in 1971 when the novel begins. Her childlike perspective of this time is seen in the novel by having Enitan's character at a similar age, aligning Sefi and Enitan's ages and developing their perception as the novel progresses. Both women also receive their education abroad in England and then return to their native homes. Although their majors differ, Enitan and Sefi's perspectives of being a Nigerian abroad would be quite similar by experiencing the same \\"culture shock.\\" In an interview with Ike Anya, Sefi even acknowledges similar characters in her own life, stating \\"every Nigerian knows a Sheri.\\" She also recalls experiencing similar situations such as dealing with her mother's traditional belief that \\"women must fulfill their duties as wives and mothers, no excuses,\\" a viewpoint that conflicted with not only her own but Enitan's as well. The parallels between the Sefi's and Enitan's lives allow the novel to have a realistic foundation and give accurate insight to the history and culture of this time period. The generation Enitan represents was born in the late 1960s, so is younger by comparison with those in many other novels of similar genre, giving Atta's book a unique perspective. The main difference lies in the different political atmosphere each generation faces. Rather than living through colonialism, those growing up in this timeframe face the aftermath of it. In terms of this generational representation, Atta states: \\"I consciously did not hold back as I wrote and ended up with this very personal chronicle of post-independent Nigeria.\\" This brings up the issue of political instability as a repercussion of colonialism by showing Nigeria at a time of political flux. The argument against colonialism is discussed by the characters: \\"Uncle Alex blamed the British for the fighting ‚Äò...Come here and divide our country like one of their bloody teacakes.‚Äô\\" Because of this blame on the British, this novel has more significance in its publication locations: the United States, England, and Nigeria, all of which have become united through colonization, which brought western culture into Nigeria. The idea of universalism is shown that by the fact that although the women of these countries may seem very different, they all face many of the same issues. At this time, England and the United States were seen as more progressive in gender ideals through women having the ability to maintain independence, but they still faced discrimination in the work place as Enitan did in her father's firm. All three countries are also faced with infidelity and race discrimination, issues that make this story relevant beyond Nigeria. To combat these issues Atta shows the negative effects and allows her main female protagonists to gain independence in the conclusion of the novel. This positive outlook on a woman's ability to become self-sufficient and successful against family and political strains of this time contributed to this novel receiving the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa.

Mixed-income housing is built through federal-, state-, and local-level efforts and through a combination of public-private-non-profit partnerships. Overview Definition The definition of mixed income housing is broad and encompasses many types of dwellings and neighborhoods. Generally speaking, a mixed income housing development includes diverse types of housing units, such as apartments, town homes, and/or single-family homes for a people with a range of income levels. Mixed income housing may include housing that is priced based on the dominant housing market (market-rate units) with only a few units priced for lower-income residents, or it may not include any market- rate units and be built exclusively for low- and moderate-income residents.Joseph, et al., 371 In the field of housing, there exists no single definition of mixed income housing or a mixed income neighborhood.Berube, A. (2006). Comment on Mark Joseph‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs Mixed-Income Development an Antidote to Urban Poverty?‚Äù Housing Policy Debate, 17 (2): 237; Brophy & Smith, 5 Berube argues that mixed income housing mirrors an organic process in urban America, and that most often ‚Äúmost mixed-income environments do not result from new housing construction, but instead arise organically from migration, income, and household changes at the neighborhood level.‚Äù Berube, 237-238 The level of organic economic integration in neighborhoods is contested, however,Gray, T.

There exists no clear metric to determine a neighborhood as \\"mixed income.\\" This article will focus on non-organic mixed income developments that are built as part of a particular policy intervention. Mixed income housing is one of two primary mechanisms to eliminate neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, combat residential segregation, and avoid the building of public housing that offers 100% of its housing units to those living in poverty. Mixed income housing development is a project-based subsidy, that is the subsidy is tied to the housing unit, not the tenant, while tenant-based assistance, such as Section 8 (housing) comes in the form of vouchers, which provide a housing subsidy that individuals can use on the open market and move to neighborhoods where landlords will take the voucher subsidy as rent payment.Ellickson, R. C. (2010). The False Promise of the Mixed-Income Housing Project. UCLA Law Review, 57: 986 Calculating Area Median Income (AMI) and pricing units at certain percentages of AMI most often determine the income mix of a mixed income housing development. How mixed income housing gets built Mixed income housing developments are built through a number of mechanisms. Schwartz and Tajbakhsh have identified four main avenues for the development of mixed income housing.Schwartz, A. & Tajbakhsh, K. (1997). Mixed-Income Housing: Unanswered Questions. Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research, 3 (2): 73 * State and local governments use density bonuses, inclusionary zoning policies, and other land use regulations to require and/or encourage housing developers to build a certain percentage of new housing units at a particular level of affordability. For example, inclusionary zoning will require developers to build a certain percentage (often 10-20%) of new units for low-income families. Density bonuses serve as an incentive, and offer developers the opportunity to build higher density buildings than they would be allowed under normal zoning regulations if they build new units at a certain level of affordability. * Public housing authorities across the country have used the federal HOPE VI program to rehabilitate distressed public housing and revitalize surrounding neighborhoods by building mixed income housing developments. * Some state and local housing finance programs offer incentives or have prerequisites for certain levels of affordability, such as in Massachusetts and New York Schwartz & Tajbakhsh, 73 * Private developers and/or non-profit community development corporations build some mixed income housing. Diverse tax credits, tax abatement programs, and funding streams available from local, state, and federal governments support them. History The promotion of safe and adequate housing has persisted since the late 1800s in the United States, when early interventions focused on tenement reforms. These efforts were primarily the purview of local governments, however, and the federal government did not enter into housing questions until 1937 when Congress passed the Wagner- Steagall Housing Act, which launched the federal public housing program that still exists today.Ellickson, 989 Historically, public housing authorities sought to achieve the goals that efforts of mixed income housing developments seek today, including the mixing of diverse residents, improved neighborhood services, and creating a ladder out of public housing.Vale, L. (2006). Comment on Mark Joseph‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs Mixed-Income Development an Antidote to Urban Poverty?‚Äù Housing Policy Debate, 17 (2): 264 Mixed income housing started to emerge in the mid-1960s and 1970s with some federal programs and when local jurisdictions initiated inclusionary zoning.Ellickson, 992 In 1983, the New Jersey State Supreme Court determined that the inclusion of affordable housing would satisfy a municipality‚Äôs state constitutional obligations to house the poor, and then in 1986, U.S. Congress authorized the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, which provided a tax credit to private developers who included affordable housing in their developments.Ellickson, 993 As evidenced by the LIHTC passage, mixed income housing became a popular policy strategy in the 1980s and 90s in an effort to de-concentrate poverty and redevelop urban neighborhoods. The 1992 the HOPE VI program emerged as the pinnacle of this interest. With rising poverty rates and increased concentration of poverty in inner city neighborhoods in the 1970s and 80s, mixed income housing captured the imagination of federal policy makers. While the federal government, and specifically the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), had ongoing housing programs, the beginning of the Bill Clinton administration brought renewed attention to the housing needs of the poor. Three specific movements and sets of scholarship converged to influence HUD's specific strategies, policies, and programs: the scholarship of William Julius Wilson in his book, The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy; the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing report that called for a significant portion of the nation‚Äôs public housing be repaired; and the emergence of New Urbanism.Fraser, J. & Nelson, M. H. (2008) Can Mixed-Income Housing Ameliorate Concentrated Poverty? The Significance of a Geographically Informed Sense of Community. Geography Compass, 2 (6): 2128 Over time, incremental federal policy set the stage for the mixed income housing developments today.Smith, J. L. (2006). Public Housing Transformation: Evolving National Policy. In Where Are Poor People to Live? Transforming Public Housing Communities, Ed. Larry Bennett, Janet L. Smith, and Patricia A. Wright, pp. 19-40. Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe William Julius Wilson and \\"The Truly Disadvantaged\\" In 1987, a prominent scholar William Julius Wilson in his book \\"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy,\\" outlined the problems for those living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. Wilson highlights the prevalence of violence out-of- wedlock births, female-headed households, and welfare dependency in inner-city neighborhoods, and the lack of role models with sustainable jobs and advanced education. He also draws connections between these problems and the restructuring of the urban economy and changes in the family and community structure of inner city communities. The deindustrialization of the urban economy and a shift to service sector jobs, have left those without a college degree at a marked disadvantage facing unemployment with little opportunity for additional education. Wilson aims to connect the plight of those living in the inner city to larger macro-economic forces and calls for public policy interventions that impact the economic organization of the United States.Wilson, W. J. (1987). The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press Wilson uses the term underclass to describe those living in the inner city, and identifies a set of ‚Äúcollective differences in behavior and outlook‚Äù that constitute a specific culture.Katz, M. B. (Ed.) (1993). The ‚ÄúUnderclass‚Äù Debate: Views from History. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press Since Oscar Lewis identified a culture of poverty in his seminal 1959 work,Lewis, O. (1961). The Culture of Poverty. In On Understanding Poverty: Perspectives from the Social Sciences, Ed. Daniel P. Moynihan, pp. 187-200. New York: Basic Books scholars have grappled with whether those living in poverty exhibit distinctive characteristics as a subculture or simply demonstrate adaptive coping mechanisms given their situation. Wilson‚Äôs bridging of the culture of poverty with macro-economic structures offered a new framework; he also called for ‚Äúa comprehensive program that combines employment policies with social welfare policies.‚Äù Wilson, 163 The National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing In 1992, the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing published a report to Congress and the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development that detailed the state of public housing. The report called for the demolition and/or rehabilitation of public housing sites across the country.The National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing. (1992). The final report of the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing: A Report to the Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Washington, D.C. The negative impacts of living such distressed and segregated public housing were further highlighted in a seminal book called American Apartheid.Massey, D. & Denton, N. (1993). American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press Massey and Denton highlighted the hypersegregation of African-Americans in the inner city in America, traced the roots of the underclass to residential segregation, facilitated by federal policies of suburbanization through mortgage subsidies, highway construction, urban renewal, and public housing construction. Massey and Denton‚Äôs work tied questions of housing and federal housing policy directly to poverty alleviation and the elimination of the underclass. Congress for New Urbanism The same year that American Apartheid was published, the Congress for New Urbanism was founded. The Congress for New Urbanism ‚Äúadvocates the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the restoration of existing urban centers and towns within coherent metropolitan regions.‚Äù As an urban design movement, New Urbanism seeks to develop vibrant, walkable, and connected communities, based on traditional neighborhood structures, street layout, and architectural design. This design and planning strategy stands in direct opposition to both sprawled suburban development and large high-rise towers of public housing. The convergence of this scholarship, national need, and new planning paradigm resulted in the federal HOPE VI program (among other policy mechanisms). While HOPE VI is the most well known federally funded mixed income effort, the following describes the theory of how mixed income housing works as poverty alleviation, regardless of funding and/or management structure. Neighborhood effects, poverty alleviation, and housing Housing is seen as a key stabilizing force for those living in poverty, particularly as the challenges of living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty have become increasingly well documented. Neighborhoods of concentrated poverty suffer from lack of investment in both the physical infrastructure and human resources. Empirical research has shown that living in poor, inner-city neighborhoods results in lower levels of educational attainment, higher participation in criminal activities and other anti-social behavior, more negative health outcomes, more exposure to violence, higher likelihood of teenage pregnancy, and social isolation from good-paying work; in other words ‚Äì place matters.Briggs, X. d. S (Ed.) (2005). The Geography of Opportunity: Race and Housing Choice in Metropolitan America. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press; Dreier, P., Mollenkopf, J., & Swanstrom, T. (2004) Place Matters: Metropolitics for the Twenty-first Century. Lawrence, KS: University of Kansas Press; Sampson, R. J., Morenoff, J. D., & Gannon- Rowley, T. (2002). Assessing \\"Neighborhood Effects\\": Social Processes and New Directions in Research. Annual Review of Sociology, 28: 443-78; Ellen, I. G. & Turner, M. A. (1997). Does Neighborhood Matter? Assessing Recent Evidence. Housing Policy Debate, 8 (4): 833-866. As the Kirwan Institute highlights, ‚ÄúNeighborhood racial and economic segregation is segregation from opportunities critical to quality of life, financial stability, and social advancement.‚Äù http://www.kirwaninstitute.org/research/opportunity-communities/ This impact of place has come to be known as \\"neighborhood effects,\\" and scholars continue to grapple with the specific ways that neighborhood impact life outcomes. Family, peer, and neighborhood influences are entangled and difficult to empirically analyze in isolation. Ellen and Turner conducted an exhaustive review of theoretical and empirical work (as of 1997 publication) on ‚Äúneighborhood effects‚Äù and developed a framework that identifies six mechanisms by which neighborhood influences individual outcomes:Ellen & Turner, 836 1\\\\. quality of local services 2\\\\. socialization by adults 3\\\\. peer influences 4\\\\. social networks 5\\\\. exposure to crime and violence 6\\\\. physical distance and isolation They draw on the seminal work of sociologist William Julius Wilson and describe the ways that adults serve as role models for children and youth through demonstrating work skills and the value of education. Choice of peer group is often influenced where you live. Likewise, social networks that provide emotional support and/or facilitate word-of-mouth information about jobs and other opportunities may be neighborhood based. Those who live in neighborhoods with high incidences of crime and violence are more likely to be victims of this crime, and also may suffer trauma from living in a heightened state of stress. Regular exposure to violence also makes violent behavior seem normal for youth. Finally, living in segregated neighborhoods geographically isolates residents from employment opportunities.Ellen & Turner, 836-42 Shortcomings Proving neighborhood effects and the positive impact of new housing is very difficult. First, studies are looking at people over time and there are great differences between impacts on young children, adolescents, and adults.Ellen & Turner, 844 Impacts on females and males may also differ. Research also suffers from issues of selection bias. Next, researchers can not clearly isolate what causes what given the very dynamic combination of people and institutions and individuals' development. Finally, researchers can not agree on the definition of neighborhood, which makes it hard to compare across study. These methodological challenges lead to variable empirical findings thus may offer ‚Äúscant guidance for policy makers\\"Ellen & Turner, 854 who lack clarity on the specific causal relationships between particular neighborhood characteristics and individual outcomes over time. Five potential strategies for addressing these challenges include: \\"1. redefining neighborhood boundaries in ways that are more consonant with social interactions and children‚Äôs experiences, 2\\\\. collecting data on the physical and social properties of neighborhood environments through systematic social observations, 3\\\\. taking account of spatial interdependence among neighborhoods, 4\\\\. analyzing the dynamics of change in neighborhood social processes, and 5\\\\. collecting benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.\\" Sampson, et al., 470 Purpose: A framework for mixed income housing as poverty alleviation While Wilson highlighted the macroeconomic forces at the root of joblessness and urban poverty, mixed income housing as a market-based strategy, seeks to address residential segregation as describe by Massey and Denton, and by extension address the ‚Äúcultural‚Äù explanations of persistent poverty, not these larger structural forces related to employment and wages. Proponents of mixed income housing suggest that building mixed income housing can improve the neighborhood and also support lower income residents by changing anti-social behaviors to pro- social ones. There are four proposed mechanisms by which mixed income housing serves as a poverty alleviation strategy: (1) social networks, (2) social control, (3) behavioral modification, (4) political economy of place.Joseph, et al.; Joseph, M. L. (2007). Is Mixed-income Development an Antidote to Urban Poverty? Housing Policy Debate 17 (2): 209‚Äì234 These elements link to Ellen & Turner‚Äôs six ways that the neighborhood influences individuals‚Äô life outcomes. * Social networks: Through interaction with residents of other incomes, mixed income housing will provide lower income residents with new social networks, enhanced social capital, and access to new networks for employment. Based on theories of social capital, this notion suggests that residents will acquire additional social capital, which links them to people outside of their immediate social circle and thus may experience increased opportunities for employment. * Social control: Higher income residents will call for an increased level of accountability around particular rules and norms in the neighborhood, yielding more order and safety. * Behavioral modification: Higher income residents will serve as role models for lower income residents around home ownership, work ethic, and other individual actions. * Political economy of place: The mere presence of higher income residents will bring in additional and higher quality services and amenities that were previously not available because of market forces and/or political power. Others highlight that mixed income housing also serves to improve neighborhoods and catalyze additional private investments and real estate development in otherwise neglected areas of a city.Berube; Costigan, P. M. (2006) Comment on Mark L. Joseph‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs Mixed-Income Development an Antidote to Urban Poverty?‚Äù Housing Policy Debate, 17 (2): 249-258 Vale, citing Marcuse articulates a tri-fold goal of neighborhood revitalization, better housing quality, and support of low-income residents.Vale, 261 He also comments that the way policies are structured seem to privilege the private investment in neighborhoods, as policy makers implicitly ask ‚ÄúWhat, politically speaking, is the minimum number of very low income households that need to be accommodated to make redevelopment financially appealing to private developers and investors?‚Äù Vale, 267 In the international context Many countries also engage in mixed income housing strategies. Research draws attention to explicit policy goals of neighborhood diversification in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, and Finland.Berube, 240 The goals and type of mixing vary by country. For example, the United Kingdom is more focused on tenure mix - that is the number of owners and renters - as opposed to a greater focus on income mixing.Kleinhans, R. (2004). Social implications of housing diversification in urban renewal: A review of recent literature. Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 19: 367-390 This tenure mix presumably works in ways similar to mixed income housing the U.S. It provides a housing ladder for renters to move up, which also creates stability by allowing for changes in residential preferences by offering renters to move to owning without having to leave the neighborhood. Further, \\"upwardly mobile residents moving or buying within the same area are considered as potential role models.\\"Kleinhans, 370 Mixed tenure may improve problems of turnover and vacancy where there is less demand for public housing. Mixed tenure also serves to deconcentrate poverty. Increased numbers of homeowners also increases residents' financial stake in a neighborhood which can have ancillary benefits.Kleinhans, 371 In the Netherlands, the attention is often on mixing incomes in rental units, with the goals of providing a housing ladder in the neighborhood and encouraging middle- and higher-income residents to stay in the city.Kleinhans, 372 Research from these countries emphasizes both dynamics of the housing market (providing people with a housing ladder) and the goals of social cohesion and role modeling. Particularly in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, policy has specifically distanced itself from social engineering, staying focused on issues of the housing market. Like the United States, the exact causal model of how mixed income or mixed tenure housing will impact individuals and/or the housing market are not clear and require further study. Similar to the United States, research has found that social mixing is limited across income groups and tenure types, but that the stigma of living in ‚Äúpublic housing‚Äù is reduced. Benefits to the physical environment are demonstrable. Overall, the research from abroad reinforces the findings from the United States experience: mixed income housing provides an important level of stability for low-income residents, but is not sufficient to lift people out of poverty in the absence of additional support systems.Berube, 242; Arthurson, K. (2006). Social Mix and the Cities. Urban Policy Research, 23 (4): 519-523; Casey, R., Coward, S., Allen, C. and Powell, R. (2007). On the planned environment and neighbourhood life: evidence from mixed-tenure housing developments twenty years on. Town Planning Review, 78 (3), 311-334. Success Necessary pre-conditions In cases where mixed income housing developments require bringing in higher income residents to inner city neighborhoods, success depends on certain conditions, including desirability of location, design and condition of development, management and maintenance, and financial viability.Brophy & Smith; Gray; Schwartz & Tajbakhsh Schwartz & Tajbakhsh also identify ‚Äúracial and ethnic composition of the development and the surrounding neighborhood and the state of the regional housing market‚ÄùSchwartz & Tajbakhsh, 75 as important preconditions. A tighter housing market helps attract residents who in a weaker housing market may have more choices and can be pickier about their location and neighbor choice.Schwartz & Tajbakhsh, 75 Gray highlights the importance of the perceptions of a particular neighborhood in attracting middle-income residents.Gray, 180 A number of factors should be taken into account: 1\\\\. To ensure day-to-day needs are taken care of and the development is well- maintained, good management is critical. 2\\\\. To support the upward mobility of the low-income residents, income-mixing and good management needs to be coupled with other support services to assist low-income residents in their professional life. 3\\\\. To meet the goals of mixed income housing - specifically to deconcentrate poverty - a sufficient number of units must be aimed at the higher income population to create a critical mass. 4\\\\. Mixed- income housing works best when the income mix is not emphasized in marketing. Additionally, all units should have the same amenities and be of the same quality. 5\\\\. To integrate a singular housing project by income is much easier than in a neighborhood. 6\\\\. Attention to not only income mix but also tenure mix is important. The mix of owners and renters, and the range of incomes in different type of rental units matters to effective management and integration. Brophy & Smith Assessment in the United States The multifold goals of mixed income housing make assessing success a challenging endeavor.Vale; Joseph, et al.; Brophy & Smith First and foremost, researchers and policymakers need better clarity around the goals so that they can develop good measures of success for mixed income developments and neighborhoods. Otherwise, as Joseph, et al. comments, ‚Äúpolicy implementation has gotten well ahead of conceptual clarity and empirical justification.‚Äù Joseph, et al., 372 =Benefits= A few benefits are evident today. First, by measure of creating and/or maintaining an affordable housing stock in the United States, mixed income housing can be considered a success. Mixed income housing developments are a more politically palatable option to housing lower income members of society, particularly in communities with deep resistance to building affordable housing or having public housing relocated through a scattered sites policy.Costigan, 251; Duke, J. (2009). Mixed Income Housing Policy and Public Housing Residents‚Äô ‚ÄúRight to the City.‚Äù Critical Social Policy, 29 (1): 105 Therefore, mixed income housing as a policy strategy has taken hold in the United States not because it is expected to alleviate poverty, but rather because of many ancillary benefits that accrue to the neighborhood, city, and all residents.Berube, 239 Second, many projects successfully have people of diverse income groups living adjacent, which is facilitated by good location, design, and management.Brophy & Smith, 28 Third, the benefits for neighborhood revitalization are demonstrable ‚Äì housing quality improves, crime decreases, property values and tax bases increase, and public goods and services are enhanced.Berube, 239; Costigan, 256; Fraser & Nelson, 2140 Likewise, mixed income housing in stable neighborhoods offer access to safer communities and potentially higher quality schools.Berube, Brophy & Smith, Vale =Questions of efficacy= Ultimately housing is an important starting point, but not sufficient to lift people out of poverty; additional support programming, job training, and other social services are needed to achieve these broader goals.Vale, Berube, Joseph, Brophy & Smith Poverty alleviation As a market-based approach, mixed income housing has been less successful improving outcomes for lower income residents, and rather demonstrate more benefits at the neighborhood level.Fraser & Nelson, 2127 As Brophy & Smith articulate, the goals of ‚Äúupward mobility of lower income residents‚Äù require additional programming, job training, and social service intervention; these services are not necessarily part and parcel of all mixed income developments. Rosenbaum, et al. have found in their evaluation of one specific project, Lake Parc Place in Chicago, that success is demonstrated through well-managed buildings and a mix of incomes in their residents; the project has not seen increased employment and improved public safety, however.Rosenbaum, J. E., Stroh, L. K., Flynn, C. A. (1998). Lake Parc Place: A Study of Mixed Income Housing. Housing Policy Debate, 9 (4): 703-740 Further, many mixed income housing projects that are part of public housing revitalization efforts do not offer a one-to-one replacement rate on the units, causing some public housing residents to be displaced. In this way, mixed income housing serves not as poverty alleviation, but rather as way to move poverty around. Most often, those displaced include the hardest-to-house, that require the most intensive services due to substance abuse, mental health issues, criminal backgrounds, physical disability, or complicated family and childcare structures.Joseph, 225 In this way, mixed income housing developments may just be moving problems around a metropolitan area and not actually lifting people out of poverty or offering them more opportunity. As Fraser & Nelson ask, ‚ÄúAre we satisfied with moving poverty around cities and metropolitan areas, or can we develop innovative and geographically informed community-based approaches for the integration of housing needs with other domain areas that affect our quality of life?‚ÄùFraser & Nelson, 2141 Further, many mixed income housing developments have strict regulations and background checks for new residents, making some of the hardest-to-house without options to move back into the community. Social networks, control, and cohesion Joseph finds limited and inconclusive evidence on enhanced social networks. Evidence for increased social control is inconclusive, but compelling; there remains question as to the cause of social control ‚Äì good management or the income mix of neighbors.Joseph, 220 Given the controversial scholarship of culture of poverty, measuring changes in behavior or norms through role modeling is rather difficult. Joseph calls into serious question the notion that role modeling from middle-income people is a valid goal/outcome of mixed income housing.Joseph, 221 Finally, the improvements brought by higher income residents‚Äô political clout have not borne out empirically, but remain compelling given greater ‚Äúparticipation in community organizations, likelihood of voting, and spending power.\\".Joseph, 221 The level of social cohesion and meaningful interaction in these new mixed income neighborhoods is an open question to achieving these broader goals of building social capital.Joseph, Gray Cost efficiency In addition to questions about the empirical evidence for social benefits of lifting people out of poverty, some criticize mixed income housing developments as too costly and not the most economically efficient way to de-concentrate poverty. Some argue that tenant-based housing vouchers offer greater possibility for social integration and cost less than project-based mixed income housing endeavors.Ellickson According to Ellickson, ‚Äúmost housing economists‚Ä¶assert that, as a general matter, portable tenant-based subsidies are markedly more efficient and fairer than project-based subsidies.‚ÄùEllickson, 995 Further, Ellickson argues that the goals of economic integration are better suited to a neighborhood, rather than project level scale, which would suggest that tenant-based subsidies would provide more opportunities for moving people out of neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and for building social contacts beyond their immediate circles.Ellickson, 1011 Ellickson contends that mixed income housing projects are economically inefficient: ‚ÄúHousing economists have consistently found that, all else equal, the development of housing units in subsidized projects, whether publicly or privately sponsored, costs significantly more than the development of unsubsidized units.‚Äù Ellickson, 997 Likewise, Schwartz suggests that further research is needed to understand if it is cheaper to build and subsidize mixed income housing developments than other forms of subsidy.Schwartz, 81 Mixed income housing developments can also cost more in terms of time and effort from developers and local governments. Because funding comes from diverse sources, developer-permitting applications are more complex. Further, new affordable housing development can raise concerns among existing residents, which at times can also slow progress.Ellickson Ellen & Turner also echo concerns about scale in their review of ‚Äúneighborhood effects‚Äù research, commenting that researchers ‚Äúmay not measure relevant neighborhood conditions accurately if they are unable to define the relevant neighborhood boundaries.‚ÄùEllen & Turner, 843-44 Thus, measuring the success of a singular mixed income project may not be the right scale, and understanding the impacts of the development on the neighborhood poses its own methodological challenges. Criticism and controversy Some of the above questions are part of serious debate and controversy. First, mixed income housing is a market-based approach, achieved through public-private partnerships characteristic of neoliberalism. Some have argued that this is a devolution of the government, as the private sector is now providing a service of the public sector, which will hinder the ability to serve those most in need. Second, when mixed income housing projects are part of public housing revitalization, they do not always offer a one-to-one replacement rate on the units, causing some public housing residents to be displaced.National Housing Law Project, Poverty & Race Research Action Council, Sherwood Research Associates, and Everywhere and Now Public Housing Residents Organizing Nationally Together. (June 2002). False HOPE: A Critical Assessment of the HOPE VI Public Housing Redevelopment Program. http://www.nhlp.org/files/FalseHOPE_0.pdf Third, the notion that role modeling by upper income residents should improve behaviors of lower income residents may be grounded in assumptions around a culture of poverty, which asserts that those living in poverty actually have an alternative value system, separate from mainstream, middle- and upper-class values. This concept is very contested and thus some question whether this type of outcome is a valid goal for mixed income housing.Joseph, 221 Directions for policy and research The questions that research and case studies raise suggest a few directions for future research. Planning and design Policy makers must clearly articulate their goals for a particular project and clarify by what metric they will measure success. Also, measuring impacts along short, medium, and long-term measures is important to fully understand the life cycle of a development or neighborhood and its residents. Prior to choosing sites and/or implementation, good analysis on financial feasibility, neighborhood characteristics, and potential market demand for goods, services, and amenities would be necessary. Also understanding the potential impacts on communities receiving new affordable housing and the concerns of residents living there, if any, is important to integrate new lower income residents smoothly and to ensure that they maintain their rights as residents in this new community.Duke, 107 In planning a development site, the income mix is a key issue; understanding what kind of income mix ‚Äì both the ‚Äúspread‚Äù of mix (super low-, low-, moderate-, and/or high-income) and the number of units per income level ‚Äì is necessary for particular results. Sometimes, a narrower gap between income levels may foster greater interaction and promote social cohesion.Vale, 266; Gray, 181; Joseph, 224 In cases where mixed income housing is renovating public housing, decisions about replacement of public housing units is critical. Further, the type of unit mix ‚Äì singles, families, etc. ‚Äì is an important factor in promoting social cohesion, as ‚Äúthe gaps between very low income transit-dependent long-term public housing tenants with children versus childless auto-equipped transient households with market-rate apartments or owned homes may simply be too vast for any form of social capital to bridge.‚ÄùVale, 266 Architectural and urban design elements can enable or inhibit a feeling of social cohesion, and so carefully choosing design elements that match the goals of mixed income development are key. Some of these may include placing higher income and lower income units adjacent to each other; ensuring that all units have the same features, amenities and aesthetic; and providing accessible common space. Community empowerment In both planning and ongoing management, broad community empowerment and participation is key, across all income levels of residents. Fraser & Nelson recommend community empowerment to accompany mixed income housing developments, in large part to help foster neighborhood relations, identify key assets and needs of the community, and ultimately to maximize the ‚Äúneighborhood effects‚Äù of the new development.Fraser & Nelson Vale also suggests that empowering lower income residents to meaningfully engage in the management of their developments can help foster positive outcomes for individuals and the neighborhood as a whole through formal and informal social controls.Vale, 266 Community engagement can be fostered or inhibited by certain design elements; creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming may be one way to provide opportunities for mingling and socialization among diverse residents. Duke suggests that participation is about more than just developing positive outcomes for integrated communities; participation and the ability to effect change in a place is fundamental to The Right to the City that needs to be protected. Physical integration is not enough to ensure that lower income residents have as much control over management, maintenance, and subsequent transformation ‚Äì other programmatic or governance structures may be needed as well: ‚ÄúIf any true transformation and integration is to occur in mixed income housing, marginalized groups would have to be involved in the process of relocation and have infrastructure in place for participation.\\"Duke, 113 Poverty alleviation While the growing body of literature suggests that economically diverse and integrated neighborhoods support residents‚Äô opportunities and life chances, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which this happens. Joseph begins to examine this in the case of Chicago, and further qualitative research could examine dynamics of neighbor interactions, level of social ties and integration, amount and quality of services, and lived experiences of the lowest income residents.Brophy and Smith; Joseph; Duke Additional research is also needed on ways to overcome NIMBY attitudes as a way to achieve meaningful social integration.Duke, 109 While mixed income housing offers one strategy for moving people out of neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, the underlying causes of poverty and segregation, such as issues of discrimination and labor market dynamics are not addressed.Duke, 108 Finally, better comparative research on unit-based housing subsidy, such as mixed income housing, and tenant-based subsidy (such as the Moving to Opportunity program, Section 8 housing vouchers, etc.) could assess the financial efficiency and social efficacy of these respective strategies for de-concentration of poverty to determine the best continued policy strategy and public investment.

Tipi ring practices They are generally found in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, but are also found in the foothills and mountains, near good areas for hunting, supplies of water and fuel, and main routes of travel. The rings are often in diameter and often occur in groupings. The rings of stone held down the edges of animal skin hides of the cone-shaped tipis, to keep them snug against the ground. The general pattern of a tipi (also \\"tepee\\") ring is an east-facing entrance, where there are no stones, and a heavily anchored side with extra stones for protection against prevailing winds, often on the northwestern side of the ring. Hearths found in the center of tipi rings suggest a winter encampment. In the summer, food was cooked in open-air hearths. There are generally few artifacts found at these sites. Stone circles, of which tipi rings are an example, may be simply assembled rocks placed in single or multiple courses. More elaborate circles have been constructed in walls of stone or with horizontal logs and stone, possibly for a fort or corral. Other stone circlessome more than across ‚Äì may be the remains of special ceremonial dance structures. A few cobble arrangements form the outlines of human figures, most of them clearly male.

She was the first woman in Europe and the United States to practice the art of mezzotint engraving, and the only woman to win a gold medal at the 1876 World Fair in Philadelphia. Sartain became a nationally recognized art educator and was the director of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1866 to 1920.Hoffmann, Mott, Sharon, Amanda (2008). Moore College of Art & Design. Arcadia Publishing. . Her father, John Sartain, and three of her brothers, William, Henry and Samuel were artists. Before she entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and studied abroad, her father took her on a Grand Tour of Europe. She helped found the New Century Club for working and professional women, and the professional women's art clubs, The Plastic Club and The Three Arts Club.  Early life  Emily Sartain was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 17, 1841. She was the fifth of eight children of Philadelphia master printer and publisher of Sartain's Magazine John Sartain and Susannah Longmate Swaine Sartain. In 1858, Sartain graduated from the Philadelphia Normal School and then taught school until the summer of 1862. John Sartain taught his daughter art, including the mezzotint engraving technique that he revived, which was a favored process in England that created high-quality prints of paintings. John Sartain believed in equal opportunities for women and encouraged his daughter to pursue a career. He mortgaged his house and gave her a \\"gentleman's education\\" in fine art by taking her on a Grand Tour of Europe beginning the summer of 1862. They started in Montreal and Quebec and then sailed for Europe. She enjoyed the English countryside; old world cities, especially Florence and Edinburgh; the Louvre; Italian Renaissance paintings; and artists like Dante and engraver Elena Perfetti. She traveled to Venice to visit William Dean Howells and his wife Elinor Mead Howells, who was a painter. Sartain decided in the course of the trip that she wanted to become an artist. During their travels the Sartains learned that William Sartain had enlisted during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and later hastily returned to the United States when John and Emily learned that the Confederate States Army had crossed into Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which is 158 miles west of Philadelphia. Of John and Susannah Sartain's children, Samuel (1830‚Äì1906), Henry (1833‚Äì1895), William Sartain (1843‚Äì1925) and Emily were painters and engravers, beginning a legacy of Sartain family artists and printmakers. Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support and connections. She carried on the mezzotint engraving technique that he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.  Education  A portrait painter and engraver, Emily Sartain studied with Christian Schussele and her father, John Sartain, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She met Thomas Eakins at the academy and entered into what biographer Henry Adams believes was Eakin's \\"first known romance\\". Their romantic relationship ended after Eakins went to Paris to study art and Eakins succumbed to what Sartain described as \\"temptations of the great city\\" and due to her interest in women's rights. The two remained lifelong friends. In 1870, Sartain met Mary Cassatt in Philadelphia and the following year they left for Paris, London, Parma, and Turin to study painting. The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Sartain spent the rest of the four-year stay in Paris and studied under √âvariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Est√©, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another with criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, a genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when she ran out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was likely to continue to help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she would more likely sell her works.  Career   Early career  Sartain set up a studio in Philadelphia in 1875 where she created paintings and engravings. Over the course of her career she made copies of paintings in Spanish and Italian galleries, portraits, genre paintings, and was the first woman to practice the art of the mezzotint in the United States and Europe. Among her works were period scenes that depicted submissive women with downcast eyes as in Italian Woman and The Reproof. Sartain exhibited her works in cities along the East Coast of the United States and was the only woman to win a gold medal at the 1876 World Fair in Philadelphia for The Reproof. She won the Mary Smith Prize for best picture by a woman at the 1881 and 1883 Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts exhibits. Sartain worked as art editor for the paper Our Continent from 1881 to 1883. She was then the art editor for New England Bygones (1883) by Ellen C. H. Rollins. Joseph M. Pennell said that Sartain was \\"the only trained woman art editor I ever knew\\". Sartain exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and at the Pennsylvania Building of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Sartain was a progressive New Woman, who with her sister-in-law, Hattie Judd Sartain, formed the woman's organization, the New Century Club. Hattie is believed to have helped her attain the commissions of portraits of local physicians Constantin Hering and James Caleb Jackson. Besides having financed her education and being her ally and mentor, Hattie also modeled for Sartain.  Philadelphia School of Design for Women  In 1886 she became the director of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, in which her father had served on the board as vice president for years. It was the country's largest art school for women, where she was, according to Henry Adams, \\"a pioneering advocate of advanced education for women.\\" Sartain implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, using draped male and nude women models, which was uncommon for women artists at the time. She created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three- dimensional and human forms. She trained women who taught art. Through her efforts, she brought the level of instruction at the school to that of a French academy and similar to that of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Industrial design schools for women were often considered purveyors of lower forms of art, but Sartain believed that good art was defined more by the artist's capabilities than the medium and that the same aesthetic principles used to judge fine art could be applied to commercial art. She was responsible for introducing important faculty members such as Robert Henri, Samuel Murray and Daniel Garber to the school. Sartain was an established, national authority on art education and art for women by 1890. She was an exhibitor, member of the Fine Arts jury, chair of the decorating committee for the Pennsylvania Building, and an art education speaker at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. In 1897, Emily Sartain and Alice Barber Stephens, a teacher at the school, founded The Plastic Club in Philadelphia. She was president of the club from 1899 to 1903 and again in 1904 and 1905. Sartain also help found the Three Arts Club. She spoke in London in 1899 at the Professional Section of the International Congress of Women. In 1900, Sartain attended the first international conference on art education in Paris. She was one of three delegates from the United States that year and again in 1904 in Berne. Her article \\"Value of Training in Design for Woman\\" was published in 1913 in The New York Times. She led the design school until 1919 or 1920. Her niece, Harriet Sartain led the school after her retirement. Harriet was Henry's daughter and had been mentored by her Aunt Emily. Sartain received certificates, medals, and diplomas in recognition of her service to art and education, including recognition from the London Society of Literature, Science and Art. Nina de Angeli Walls wrote,  Later years  Sartain retired to San Diego, California. During her career Sartain traveled to Europe most summers and continued to travel abroad every year during her retirement. She was visiting in Philadelphia when she died on June 17, 1927.

As its name suggests, it runs down the right, or east, bank of Lake Z√ºrich, connecting Z√ºrich to Rapperswil. The line was opened in 1894, nineteen years after the complementary left bank railway. As built, it originally departed from the surface level of Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof station in a westerly direction, before performing a clockwise 270 degrees turn via a viaduct over the River Limmat and the Letten Tunnel to Stadelhofen station. Since 1990 the Letten Tunnel has been closed and replaced by the Hirschengraben Tunnel, which takes a direct easterly route under the River Limmat from new low level platforms at Hauptbahnhof. At the same time as the Hirschengraben tunnel was constructed, the Z√ºrichberg tunnel was constructed in order to link Stadelhofen station with the Z√ºrich to Winterthur and Wallisellen to Rapperswil via Uster lines. As a consequence the section of the right bank line between Z√ºrich Hbf and Stadelhofen is now part of the backbone of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, carrying no fewer than eight separate routes. However beyond Stadelhofen the traffic reduces to three S-Bahn routes. Routes S6 and S16 stop at all stations as far as Uetikon or Meilen respectively. Route S7 runs non-stop from Stadelhofen as far as Meilen, then serves all stations to Rapperswil. The line is long, standard gauge and electrified at supplied by overhead line. It is predominantly double-track, but with single- track sections from Stadelhofen to Tiefenbrunnen, Herrliberg-Feldmeilen to Meilen, Uetikon to St√§fa, and Uerikon to Rapperswil.

Her grandfather on her mother's side was William Watson, sheriff-substitute of Aberdeen from 1829 to 1866, who in 1841 founded there the first industrial school for street children. Her father graduated from Marischal College in the same city and was ordained in Sunderland in 1859. He became minister of Erskine United Free Church, Arbroath, in 1876, and retired from the ministry in 1900.

She and her sister returned to Aberdeen in 1921. However, Emily became mentally ill in April 1930 and was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Asylum, Gartnavel. Marion moved to various places around Glasgow to be near the institution where her sister was.

Poetry The first important published work by Marion Angus was a biography of her grandfather: Sheriff Watson of Aberdeen: the Story of his Life and his Work for the Young (1913). She did not begin to write poetry until after 1918. Her first volume, written in Scots, was The Lilt, which came out about the same time as MacDiarmid's first experiments in the Dunfermline Press. The first stanza of the title poem establishes Angus's \\"voice\\" as a poet. Five other volumes of verse followed: The Tinker's Road and other Verses (1924), Sun and Candlelight (1927), The Singin' Lass (1929), The Turn of Day (1931), and Lost Country and other Verses (1937). Her work was influenced by the Scottish ballad tradition and by early Scots poets such as Robert Henryson and William Dunbar, rather than by Burns. She associated in the pre-war Scottish Renaissance initially with revivalists like Violet Jacob, Alexander Gray and Lewis Spence,Scottish renaissance (2000). In The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English.

She also did radio work at that time. MacDiarmid voiced qualified approval of Angus's poetry in polemics for the Scottish Literary Journal in 1925 and 1926. Angus herself spoke of her ambitions and limitations as a poet in an address in the 1920s to the Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse: \\"I would fain give voice to Scotland's great adventure of the soul.\\"Association of Scottish Literary Studies: Retrieved 8 December 2011. However, Helen Cruickshank notes in a memoir that Angus did not think highly of MacDiarmid as a poet or approve of his experiments in Synthetic Scots. Nonetheless, they moved in the same direction, going back beyond Burns to earlier, mainly Eastern Scots ballad and folk song traditions. As Cruikshank put it, \\"She was steeped in the knowledge and lore of the Ballads, until they seemed part of her life. Lost love, unquiet spirits, barley-breid and elder- wine: they are the very stuff of the Ballads.\\"Scottish Poetry Library site. The scholar Katherine Gordon saw steady development in her work through the 1920s and 1930s: \\"The understated lyricism of The Lilt and Other Verses becomes, by the late 1920s, distinctly stronger and more emotionally potent in Sun and Candlelight and The Singin' Lass.\\"Voices from their Ain Countrie..., p. 9. Her interest in the supernatural in literature emerged early: \\"One poem which, when I was a child, made my flesh creep and filled me with a tearful pity\\" was 'The Brownie of Blednoch' by William Nicholson (1782‚Äì1849).Marion Angus: Scottish Poetry Old and New.

Commenting on the sparseness of the information about Angus's life, Chalmers warns against extrapolating it from her poetry: \\"The pity is that rather than recognising her skill at transforming the particular into the universal, critics have sometimes allowed conjecture about her private life to stereotype and define the poet, thereby influencing their evaluation of her work.\\"Quoted on the Scottish Poetry Library site.

He was appointed Minister of Economy of Argentina by President Cristina Kirchner in 2011. Life and times Lorenzino was born in La Plata. His family moved to Puerto Madryn, Chubut Province, in 1974, and Lorenzino was raised in the coastal Patagonia city. He met his future wife there, and together they enrolled at the National University of La Plata, where Lorenzino earned a Law degree and a master's degree in public finance; he later earned a master's degree in Economics at Torcuato di Tella University. He was appointed Provincial Director of Funding Policy and Public Credit for the Province of Buenos Aires by Governor Felipe Sol√° in 2004, during which tenure he managed the redemption of the remaining Patac√≥n bonds issued as complementary currency by Governor Carlos Ruckauf during the depths of the 2001 crisis. Following the end of Sol√°'s administration in 2007, Lorenzino was appointed Financial Representative for Argentina in Washington, D.C. The resignation of Economy Minister Mart√≠n Lousteau amid the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector in April, led to Lorenzino's appointment as Secretary of Finance for the new Economy Minister, the more conciliatory Carlos Rafael Fern√°ndez. Lorenzino managed the second phase of the Argentine debt restructuring in this capacity; its first phase had been initiated in 2005 by Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna, and had resulted in the renegotiation of two-thirds of the US$82 billion in sovereign bonds defaulted in 2001. The second phase, involving the renegotiation of US$18 billion in bonds retained by holdouts from the 2005 exchange, was completed in June 2010. Holders of two-thirds of this latter tranche accepted the offer prepared by Lorenzino, and the proportion of bonds rescued from default thus rose to over 92%. Lorenzino also served in La graN maKro, a center-left economic and social policy think tank closely allied with Kirchnerism. Enjoying a good working relationship with Economy Minister Amado Boudou, Lorenzino was nominated to replace him when the latter was elected Vice President of Argentina in President Cristina Kirchner's landslide, 2011 reelection. Lorenzino was, moreover, the most pragmatic major official in Boudou's team with regards to the international bond market and the Paris Club of creditors, and the Minister-designate subsequently announced that debt restructuring would be acquire a greater policy relevance during his tenure. An April 2013 interview by Greek journalist Eleni Varvitsioti resulted in a stir when Lorenzino refused to answer a question regarding Argentine inflation; unbeknownst to him, the microphones were left on and recorded him saying me quiero ir (\\"I want to leave\\"). He then departed, leaving the interview unfinished, baffling both the local and the international press. Lorenzino's tenure was marked by ongoing efforts to counter vulture fund lawsuits to obtain payment at face value on nearly USD1.5 billion of bonds bought for pennies on the dollar. The Argentine offer prepared by Lorenzino, based on his successful 2010 restructuring, would give the largest of the vulture funds, Caymans-based NML Capital Limited, a 284% return; NML had filed injunctions in U.S. courts to attach future payments to other bondholders by way of forcing Argentina to settle and thus obtain returns of up to 1380%. Cristina Kirchner appointed Axel Kicillof as the new minister of economy on November 18, 2013. Lorenzino was sent in a task force to negotiate the Argentine debt restructuring.Cristina Fernandez reshuffles cabinet and names new economic team References External links *Minsterio de Econom√≠a y Finanzas Publicas Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from La Plata Category:People from Puerto Madryn Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:National University of La Plata alumni Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Argentine Ministers of Finance ","title":"Hern√°n Lorenzino"},{"id":"33995736","text":"Materials Evaluation is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering nondestructive testing, evaluation, and inspection published by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing.

Species of Microcotyle are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. Species of Microcotyle have only one host in their entire life cycle. Different species of Microcotyle inhabit marine and freshwater and they can also infect different species of fishes. They are uniquely characterized by their haptor having a lot of tiny clamps on the lateral margins. Although not really known to cause that much damage in marine wildlife, some of them are reported to cause agricultural problems like Microcotyle sebastis as an example. Microcotyle sebastis commonly affects Sebastes schlegeli, a maricultured fish in Korea.Kim, Ki. H, and Eun. Lee, and Se. Kwon, and Jae. Cho. (2001). Treatment of Microcotyle sebastis infestation in cultured rockfish Sebastes schlegeli by oral administration of praziquantel in combination with cimetidine. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 44 (2), pp. 133‚Äì136 Morphology Individuals of species of Microcotyle, like any typical polyopisthocotylean monogenean, have an anterior organ called prohaptor, which is mainly used for feeding and attachment. Although the prohaptor is not the primary attachment organ, it is used to anchor the body of the parasite while the opisthaptor is being repositioned. The opisthaptor is found in all Microcotyle species and it is an important attachment organ that allows these ectoparasites to latch onto their hosts. Located at the anterior part of the worm is the funnel-shaped mouth that is connected to the pharynx, followed by the esophagus that is smaller in diameter compared to the pharynx. About one tenth of the entire length of the worm, the esophagus then divides into intestinal crura, which extends further posteriorly. The cruca is divided into pouches, which extend between vitellaria. Vitallaria are glands that secrete yolk around the egg. This digestive pathway is observed to be continuous throughout the entire worm. Food particles were observed to be passing back and forth along these pathways in vivo.Remley, L. W. 1942. Morphology and life history studies of Microcotyle spinicirrus MacCallum 1918, a Monogenetic Trematode parasitic on the gills of Aplodinotus grunniens. Transactions of the American Microscopical Society, Vol. 61, No. 2 (Apr., 1942), pp141‚Äì155 The worms are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female organs. Each worm has reproductive organs such as vas deferens, testis, uterus, vitelline duct, ovary, and vitellaria. They also have flame cells that function as a kidney and remove waste material. A short duct that opens to the outside on the dorsal surface is composed of four canals on each side, two posterior and two anterior, that come together laterally to the cirrus. During observation on immature specimens, these canals can still be seen. However, on adults, these canals are concealed by vitellaria. Life Cycle Species of Microcotyle have a direct life cycle; no intermediate hosts are needed to complete its life cycle. Marine fishes are the definitive host of these parasites. The adults live on the gill of the fishes as ectoparasites. The eggs are released into water, hatch and develop as oncomiracidium. The oncomiracidia, free swimming form larvae, move around and attach to another fish and grow into adult stage. The life cycle of species of Microcotyle is completed and repeated again and again. Treatment Bath treatment using praziquantel is the effective methods of treating Microcotyle sebastis on rockfish.Kim, Ki. H, and Jae. Cho. (2000). Treatment of Microcotyle sebastis (Monogenea: Polyopisthocotylea) infestation with praziquantel in an experimental cage simulating commercial rockfish Sebastes schlegeli culture conditions.. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, Vol.40: 229-231, pp. 229‚Äì231 An experiment was done to indicate that feeding a praziquantel-adsorbed diet significantly reduces the abundance of M. sebastis infestation, and bathing in 100 ppm praziquantel for 4 minutes is effective for controlling M. sebastis infestation in a practical rockfish culture system.

It is endemic to a few isolated parts of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is elusive in the wild but sometimes makes its appearance unexpectedly in seawater cultures of other organisms in the laboratory. Synonymy Vallentinia gabriellae is found in the south west Atlantic. A related species, Vallentinia adherens, is found in the Pacific Ocean and the two are so similar that it has been suggested that they are different populations of the same species.Vallentinia gabriellae (Hitch-hiking Jellyfish). Smithsonian Marine Station. Retrieved 2011-12-08. Description Vallentinia gabriellae can grow to about 12 millimetres (0.5 in) in diameter but is more usually 6 to 8 millimetres across. The dome-shaped bell of the medusa is two thirds as high as it is wide. It is transparent and gelatinous and has 4 radial canals. Alongside their lower ends lie 4 folded, sac-like gonads. There are 4 to 8 large tentacles halfway down the outside of the bell located between the radial canals and sometimes 4 more, close to them. These have adhesive pads on their tips which allows the jellyfish to grip hold of objects. There are up to 128 (more usually 64-75) hollow tentacles fringing the margin of the bell. These have several rings of nematocysts along their length. Between the tentacles are statocysts, sensory organs which can detect gravitational pull and which help the animal to orient itself correctly. Underneath the bell there is a central manubrium with the mouth at its tip. This connects to the gastrovascular cavity, the radial canals and the circular marginal canal.Zooplankton of the South Atlantic Ocean: Vallentinia gabriellae Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-12-08. Distribution and habitat Vallentinia gabriellae is found on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean. It is known from isolated sites in Brazil, the Yucatan Peninsula, Louisiana, Florida and Bimini in the Bahamas. It lives in shallow water, on or close to the seabed. In the Indian River Lagoon in Florida it was first detected in 1990, in a barrier ditch adjoining mangrove swamps. In Louisiana it was found in a seagrass bed. It has been found experimentally to be tolerant of a wide range of salinities and a wide range of temperatures. Life cycle Reproduction in Vallentinia gabriellae has two phases. These are the medusa or jellyfish which reproduces sexually and a polyp that reproduces by budding. The male and female medusae liberate gametes into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into planula larvae which are planktonic. After some time drifting with the current, they settle onto the seabed, undergo metamorphosis and become sedentary. The smallest polyps that form, under 1 millimetre (0.04 in) long, have 2 tentacles while older, larger ones have 3 to 5. The polyps can reproduce asexually, budding to form either more polyps or free-swimming medusae. A polyp can have several buds forming at any one time. Polyps can also bud to produce frustules. These are groups of about 4 polyps embedded in mucus and capable of withstanding adverse circumstances. When conditions improve they can develop into new polyps over the course of a few weeks. Ecology On several occasions, specimens of Vallentinia gabriellae have unexpectedly appeared in cultures of other marine organisms in the laboratory. The ease with which they can be cultured (fed on brine shrimps (Artemia salina)) has led to the possibility of their being used for teaching purposes and in medical research. Knowledge of this species mostly comes from observations in the laboratory because they have only infrequently been found in the wild. In a feeding trial, specimens of Vallentinia gabriellae were deprived of food for 48 hours and then offered a choice of rotifers, copepods, nematodes, crab zoeal larvae and gastropod veliger larvae. They preferred larger items of prey which they immobilised with their nematocysts before ingesting them whole. They continued feeding until replete. Other unfed jellyfish were offered juvenile fish (mullet) ranging in size from 12 to 15 millimetres in length, larger than the 10 millimetre diameter of the jellyfish. These were entangled and immobilised by the marginal tentacles, eventually being wrapped round and enclosed by the mobile manubrium. Undigested remains were expelled the following day.

Biography Born in Sheffield, the son of a journalist who eventually became editor of the Methodist Recorder, Burnett studied at the London School of Economics. After finishing his National Service serving in India with the Intelligence Corps, Burnett joined the BBC's Far Eastern Service at Bush House in 1949. Personal Call, a radio series in which Burnett visited public figures of the day, was later developed into the series he produced for television, Face to Face, which consisted of interviews by John Freeman with prominent people from around the world. Later, he became a documentary maker and made a sequence of films, often shot secretly, about apartheid: South Africa Loves Jesus (1971), outlining the attitudes of Christian denominations to the South African government's race policies, and The Colour Line (1971), in which a blood bank labels its stock according to the race of the donor. During the 1970s, he made three programmes about the supernatural and ghostly occurrences. These were The Ghost Hunters (1975), The Mystery of Loch Ness (1976) and Out of This World (1977), about UFOs. His cartoons appeared in magazines such as the New Statesman, Private Eye, and The Oldie. The depiction of monks was a speciality; anthologies of his cartoons were published in the 1960s and 1970s in paperback under titles such as \\"Top Sacred\\" (1960), \\"Sacred and Confidential\\", and \\"Beware of the Abbott\\".

By the year 1049 when a prior hermitage was donated to John Gualbert, the founder of the Vallombrosan Order. The abbey became one of the major sites of the order and itself a wealthy landowner by the mid-14th century.Dizionario geografico fisico storico della Toscana, Volume 1, by Emanuele Repetti, Florence 1833, page 21-22. Refurbished and altered over the centuries, in 1866 the monks were expelled and the site was sold to private owners, one of whom created some of the faux crenellations and towers. In the 20th century, the abbey was restored to a small monastic order. Outside of the cloistered abbey complex is the Romanesque 12th-century church of San Michele Arcangelo; the church has undergone numerous reconstructions. In the attached small hamlet of Passignano is the parish church of San Biagio, built in 1080. The abbey in the 19th-century housed a remarkable collection of over 6000 parchment manuscripts, many brought here by Grand-Duke Leopold.Repetti page 22, The abbey is known for a number of frescoes, created by artists over a number of centuries, including works by Filippo di Antonio Filippelli, Benedetto Veli, Alessandro Pieroni, Alessandro Allori, Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli, Giuseppe Nicola Nasini, and Domenico Passignano The refectory houses frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his brother Davide.

It is related to the New Zealand species Maritrema novaezealandensis, and like its New Zealand relative, Maritrema subdolum infects local amphipods, in this case, Corophium volutator and Corophium arenarium. The cercariae of M. subdolum emerge from the first intermediate host, a gastropod of the genus Hydrobia for example, and seek out the next host, a crustacean. There the cercariae develop into metacercariae and form metacercarial cysts of different sizes.  Morphology  Maritrema subdolum has 2 layers: an inner transparent and an outer light-refractory layer. The latter encloses either the entire body or only the anterior end. It lies in a pouch formed by an invagination of the tegument of the oral sucker and its posterior end is surrounded in the syncytial layer at the base of the pouch in close contact with the basal membrane. The anterior end is limited only by an external plasmatic membrane. The cercarial body is a strongly developed tegumental spine.  Pathogenicity  Maritrema subdolum is the bane of the local crustacean population. The main transmission window of M. subdolum seems to occur during low water in tidal pools where light levels are high and solar radiation rapidly elevates the water temperature, as well as salinity through evaporation. M. subdolum does not affect all of its crustacean hosts equally and this has some important ecological consequences.

Overview The project completed in 1985 by the international team Ricardo Bofill \\"Encyclopedia of contemporary Spanish culture\\" written by Eamonn J. Rodgers Taller de Arquitectura was part of a renovation program in Paris 14th arrondissement, near Montparnasse train station. Within this sensitive context the respect to the configuration of the existing urban tissue demanded a specific architectonic vocabulary. By applying the essence of baroque architecture Book: \\"An Introduction to Architectural Theory: 1968 to the Present\\" written by Harry Francis Mallgrave,David Goodman the fa√ßade is not a mere wall, it breaks the established rigidity imposed by the industrial building system and becomes a d√©cor for the city. In designing the buildings the team confronted two imperatives: to respect the urban Book: \\"Emerging concepts in urban space design\\" written by Geoffrey Broadbent context and to obtain a formal relationship with the interior spaces of the project. Les √âchelles du Baroque consists of a building apartment surrounding a circular plaza which, by its axial condition, encloses the project perspectives; behind this space, two clearly differentiated apartment blocks define two additional plazas: one elliptical and the other amphitheatre-shaped. The fa√ßades facing the elliptical plaza define an elliptical space as the Italian baroque plazas. For these fa√ßades the architectural team used a curtain wall with glass columns that add rhythm to the design and become the bow-windows of the apartments. The three buildings contain 274 apartments over seven floors with a basement level for car park (300 cars). The ground floor contains apartments, shops, offices and workshops. The geometry of the apartments is based on the combination of modules in plan. The basic apartment module is 65 sqm (3 bedroom apartment unit).

The club play on what is regarded as \\"one of the best water based pitches in the country.\\" Gordonians is one of the most successful teams in Scotland having won the Scottish Cup 4 times as well as 17 other National trophies History Gordonians Hockey Club was formed in 1911 to provide former pupils of Robert Gordon's College with the opportunity to continue playing hockey after their school years and to maintain contact with each other. Although it was initially an exclusive club for former pupils, Gordonians now have an open membership policy as well as ladies and youth teams. Gordonians continue to enjoy a strong relationship with the school and benefit from the use of the fantastic hockey facilities at Countesswells where two pitches were laid in 2004 - one water-based and one sand-based. Gordonians played in friendly matches until the North District Leagues were formed in the 1960s. The 1st XI was invited to join the newly formed National Leagues in 1976, and was placed in Division 3. They won Division 3 in their third season, won Division 2 the following season, and held their place in Division 1 of the National Leagues from 1980/81 to 2008/09 - a record 29 seasons. Although Gordonians have not yet won the NL1 title, the 1st XI came within one point of the Scottish Championship in 1996 and were runners-up again in 1998. They have, however, had considerable success in cup competitions having won the Scottish Cup 4 times and as a result represented Scotland in the European Cup Winners Cup in Poznan (1994), The Hague (1996), Rome (1998), and Eindhoven (2002). Gordonians also took part in the inaugural European Cup Winners Cup in Barcelona in 1990, having finished as runners up in the 1989 Scottish Cup to the league champions that year. The 2nd XI have won the National Scottish Districts Cup for 2nd XI teams 8 times, only bettered by one other club. The 2nd XI joined the Scottish Regional League North in 2000 when the regional leagues were formed and have won it 8 times. Prior to this they had won the North District League Division One a total of 12 times. The formation of the regional leagues allowed the 3rd XI the opportunity to dominate North District League 1 from 2000, and they have won it 6 times. The 3rd XI have also won the National Scottish Reserve Cup 6 times. In 2009 the 3rd XI stepped up to the Regional League North. The club's 4th XI play in the North District League Division 1 winning the title for the first time in 2007 and again in 2008, with our 3rd XI finishing as runners-up on both occasions. In 2008 the 4th XI won their first national trophy, the Scottish Reserve Plate. In May 2001, Gordonians merged with Merlins Ladies Hockey Club to form a combined club. Merlins Gordonians won the Scottish Districts Cup in 2005 and elected to move up from the North District League to the National League 3 in 2005/6. They won NL3 in only their second season in 2007 and finished a very creditable 4th in NL2 in 2008, but due to the loss of some key players to universities elsewhere were relegated back to NL3 in 2009 but became NL3 Champions for the second time in 2010 and are back playing in NL2. The Club has been running a very successful Youth Coaching programme for the past ten years with around 90 boys and girls attending Tuesday coaching sessions, and competing in national competitions at U-14, U-16 and U-18 level. It has taken the U-18 boys on tour to the Netherlands every Easter since 2004 and several of these boys have gone on to gain promotion to the 1st or 2nd XIs. In 2008/9, nine of them were selected for Scotland training squads across three age levels.

The Abbey of San Guglielmo al Goleto is a Benedictine monastery in Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi, province of Avellino, region of Campania Italy. The monastery was founded by Saint William of Vercelli in the year 1114. It was started as a female cloister, with a small attached monastery for the spiritual guidance and economic assistance of the nuns. The period 1135-1515 was known as the \\"Age of the Nuns.\\" The cloister became wealthy from 1135 to 1348 until the black death struck and the cloister began to decline. On January 24, 1506, Pope Julius II declared that, upon the death of the last abbess, the cloister would be closed, which occurred in 1515. The age of the nuns was followed by the \\"epoch of the monks\\" from 1515 to 1807. When the cloister closed, the monastery merged with that on Montevergine and began to grow. Pope Sixtus V, who was also superior of the Franciscan Convent of S. Angelo dei Lombardi, accelerated this growth. The monastery reached its peak between the mid-seventeenth century and the mid- eighteenth century. In 1807, the king of Naples, Joseph Bonaparte, ordered the Abbey closed. St. William's body was moved to Montevergine and the furnishings of the abbey were looted. The abbey remained abandoned until 1973 when a monk of Montevergine, Lucio M. De Marino, obtained permission to relocate to Goleto, reoccupying the abbey and beginning its restoration. In 1989, the Abbey was entrusted to the Little Brothers of Jesus.

He died in 1623, leaving behind one of very few wills and testaments of African residents of colonial Latin America. His daughter Ana Mar√≠a, and the confraternity to which he belonged in the hospital of the Limpia Concepci√≥n, also left behind documents describing a court battle which detail the final requests made by Juan Roque concerning a house ‚Äúin the neighborhood of San Hip√≥lito in the lane next to the College of San Juan where it meets the open air market of San Hip√≥lito, bordering the houses of the marshals and those of Don √Ångel de Villasa√±a.‚Äù\\"Juan Roque's Donation,\\" in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 89.  Africans in New Spain  Africans played a notable role in the Spanish Conquest. As the Spanish and Portuguese control in colonial Latin America spread, Africans have been stereotyped in the English-speaking world as slaves. However, this was not always the case. Africans and mulattos played active roles in the early 16th century, acting as conquistadors. Juan Garrido, Juan Garc√≠a, and Juan Valiente were all successful conquistadors, who became part of the Spanish communities as the conquest was completed. By the 17th century, Africans lived in colonial Latin America, with distinctive organizations and communities that blended African culture with the laws and social expectations of the Spaniards. In New Spain, Africans, who originated from modern day coastal Sierra Leone, founded a brotherhood in Mexico City,Von Germeten, Nicole, and Martin Austin Nesvig. \\"Routes to Respectability: Confraternities and men of African descent in New Spain.\\" in Local religion in colonial MexicoAlbuquerque: University of New Mexico (2006): 215-233. which became the Zape Confraternity. Documents describe how Africans rose from slavery to become influential members of the community. The wealth and status of Juan Roque Brought to New Spain as a slave before 1600, Juan Roque left a comprehensive will and testament at his death. It reveals the importance of 'confraternities' to the African community in Mexico City, as well as the prominence some Africans were able to achieve. Written before his death in 1623, this last will and testament provided for a lavish and expensive funeral and lists profitable real estate that helped ensure the survival of the Zape Confraternity in Mexico City for several decades after his death. Both expensive and Catholic, Juan Roque‚Äôs funeral provides evidence that Africans could establish themselves within communities in colonial Latin America. He requested that he be buried either in the church of the Hospital of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception or the Sant√≠sma Veracruz Church of which he was a parishioner. In addition, Juan Roque asked that the brotherhoods to which he belonged, like the Zape Confraternity, accompany his body to the burial and that fifty-five Masses be sung for his soul at different churches around Mexico City, as well as twenty Masses sung for his deceased wife, Isabel de Herrera.\\"Juan Roque's Donation,\\" in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro- Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 87. In her essay analyzing confraternities in New Spain, Nicole von Germeten points out that as a prominent and wealthy African in Mexico City, Juan Roque's lavish funeral ‚Äúwith all the trappings of baroque religiosity‚Äù and membership in a confraternity like that of the Zape nation demonstrates the respectability of men of African descent in colonial Latin America.Von Germeten and Nesvig, \\"Routes to Respectability\\", 221. Roque stated that his deceased wife was a free black woman, and when bequeathing his profitable real estate in the neighborhood of San Hip√≥lito, Juan Roque pointed to the status of his daughter, Ana Mar√≠a, as a legitimate daughter from his marriage ‚Äúaccording to the Most Holy Church‚Äù to Isabel de Herrera and therefore a free black woman. Designating these Africans as free, gave them status within the community and helped the Zape Confraternity, as it made its case to regain the income from houses around San Hip√≥lito, following Ana Mar√≠a dying childless. Confraternities Before her death, Ana Mar√≠a spoke to members of the Zape Confraternity confirming that her father had wished the brotherhood to receive the income from the real estate in San Hip√≥lito. In colonial Latin America, confraternities were organizations that allowed Africans to achieve a sense of community after being taken from their homeland through the slave trade. These brotherhoods also facilitated the Africans‚Äô conversion to Catholicism: by providing a place of worship, a Christian community, and financial support for members' funerals.Robert Haskett, ‚ÄúThe Many Catholicisms of Colonial Mexico,‚Äù 216. The confraternities provided social welfare for Africans in New Spain and limited health care, when Africans were denied access to other assistance. The importance of the confraternity‚Äôs ability to aid its members monetarily, is clearly evident In the court documents detailing the Zape Confraternity‚Äôs battle to receive the income of Juan Roque‚Äôs houses in San Hip√≥lito. Juan Roque‚Äôs exact description of the location of the houses, in his last will and testament, attempted to ensure that his daughter. and eventually the confraternity, received the benefits of the properties. Several witnesses said that Ana Mar√≠a was adamant that her father wished the houses to go to the brotherhood, should she die without children. Even when one of the elder members of the confraternity urged her to agree with her husband and sell the houses, Ana Mar√≠a refused, because her father ‚Äúcharged her that if she did not have children she should not dispose of the houses, but give them the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception (the Zape Confraternity), of which he was a member and founder, so that the blacks of the Zape nation would administer them and take care of their earnings.‚Äù‚ÄúJuan Roque‚Äôs Donation,‚Äù in Kathryn Joy McKnight, Afro-Latino Voices, (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009), 103.

Introduced to run on country rail services, the \\"Barwell Bulls\\" serviced most of the state's railway lines until they were eventually replaced by both the Bluebird and Redhen railcars, with the last units withdrawn in 1971. Background In 1924, the South Australian Railways (SAR) decided to order a group of railcars in order to continue services at country stations that did not have enough passengers to make those services financially viable. J.G. Brill Company were contracted to supply twelve railcar chassis, which would be mated to bodies constructed by the SAR's own Islington Railway Workshops. Numbered 4 to 15, these 12 railcars entered service during 1924 and 1925 as the Model 55 railcar class, and overnight these trains were a success.8 National Railway Museum Two years later the Brill company supplied the SAR with an enlarged version, known as the Model 75. The first was built by J.G. Brill Company with the remaining 38 by the Islington Railway Workshops, entering service in 1927. They differed from the 55s in having a Winton 4-cylinder petrol engine, at 17.8 metres were three metres longer and had a capacity of 63 versus 43. The first 30 (30-59) entered service on the broad gauge with the other eight (100-106 and 487) built for narrow gauge operation. They were married with 200 and 300 series trailer carriages. One was sold to the Victorian Railways in 1928 after only a few months service.41 National Railway Museum In service The 55s and 75s worked on country lines around South Australia until their withdrawal from service, and originally featured a brown livery. To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the SAR in 1936, all Model 55s and 75s still in service were repainted into a green and cream livery, which they wore until retirement.South Australian Railways Model 75 Brill railcars Pichi Richi Railway Later, yellow stripes were added to the front to increase visibility. The 55s were built for operation on the broad gauge network, although two (numbers 4 and 10) did operate on the narrow gauge for a time, being renumbered 112 and 111. All 55s were powered by Midewest four-cylinder petrol engines, while the 75s used the more powerful Winton Model 110 six-cylinder engines. From 1934, the SAR began re-powering the 55s with Gardner six- cylinder diesel engines but, as a result of World War II, some railcars were not converted until after 1945. At the same time, multiple-unit controls were fitted to the Brill railcars. In the 1950s, the 75s were re-powered with Cummins diesel engines. Victorian Railways 44RM & 200MT In 1928, a Model 75 and trailer were sold to the Victorian Railways, to become their 44RM and 200MT. This was as a trial for comparison against other railmotors then in service, and regularly operated between Echuca and Toolamba.Newsrail October 1981 p. 247 44RM was damaged in a level crossing collision in 1944. It was formally withdrawn in 1947 and scrapped in 1951. 200MT remained in service until the mid 1970s, then was stored at the back of the Bendigo carriage shed until early 1981. It was then transferred to Newport Workshops for preservation.Newsrail June 1981 p. 135 It is now preserved at Daylesford Spa Country Railway Withdrawal and preservation Preserved Model 55 railcar no. 8 at the alt=Preserved Model 55 railcar no. 8 at the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide, 2014 Brill Model 55 (left) and Model 75 railcars on the north railcar depot tracks at Adelaide railway station, 1962 However, the Brills were facing replacement during the 1950s. In 1955 the SAR introduced its Bluebird and Redhen railcars, and the \\"Barwell Bulls\\" ‚Äì nicknamed after a former Premier of South Australia, Henry Barwell, and the bovine sound that the air horn emitted ‚Äì were moved to suburban services in Adelaide. As more Redhens were constructed to replace them on the metropolitan lines, the last Brill railcars were withdrawn in October 1971. Five Brills have been preserved. Railcars 8 (55) and 41 (75) are at the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide, 106 (75) and trailer car 305 are at the Pichi Richi Railway in operational condition. SteamRanger has 60 (75) which was converted from condemned Brill trailer 207 and also 43 (75) which was donated to the society at no cost long-time ARHS member John Wilson.Restoration to Service of Brill Railcar 60 SteamRangerBrill Diesel Railcar 43 SteamRanger Trailer 200MT, sold to the Victorian Railways in 1928, was preserved at the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre. It was later transferred to the South Gippsland Railway, and in 2017 it became the responsibility of the Yarra Valley Railway. The remainder have been scrapped or converted to PWS sleeping cars for use by railways workers. A few ended up as accommodation at the Barossa Junction Motel in the Barossa Valley. This motel has since closed and the carriages sold on to new owners.

The designer is disputed and Chip Erwin, Larry Whiting and Robin Haynes are all named as designers. The aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page E-28 and E-41. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Design and development The aircraft was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of . The aircraft has a standard empty weight of . It features a high-wing supported by dihedral stabilizers, a single-seat, open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft structure is made from aluminum tubing. Its span wing sits high above the pilot's seat, providing pendulum stability. The controls are very unconventional and all are canard mounted, which has two surfaces. The canard surfaces move in unison to produce pitch and separately, in opposite directions, to produce roll. The large fixed dihedral stabilizers provide yaw control as the wing has no dihedral of its own for yaw coupling. The canard surfaces are mounted to the front of the main keel tube, which serves as a fuselage. The pilot is accommodated on an open seat bolted to the same tube. The Cuyuna 430 powerplant is located behind the pilot. In service the control system has proved inadequate and the aircraft is difficult to control in flight, particularly in air that is not smooth and there have been a number of loss-of-control accidents. The Virtual Ultralight Museum describes the aircraft as \\"ungainly and unstable\\". Reviewer Andre Cliche says of the Tomcat's handling characteristics: Cliche recommends that Tomcats be scrapped for parts and not flown. An improved model, the Pintail, was later introduced by Haynes, which has control surfaces on the trailing edge of the dihedral stabilizers, but it is unclear if this fully addresses the original design's deficiencies.

It is known to vary in luminosity, but only by about 0.01 to 0.02 magnitudes. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is . At an estimated distance of based on parallax measurements, this yields a physical size of about 8‚Äì9 times the radius of the Sun. The outer envelope has an effective temperature of 4,920 K, giving it the yellow-orange hue of a star near the transition from a G- to a K-type classification.

Description Cirsium muticum is a biennial plant that reaches a height of . Its taproot is fleshy and its stem is ridged with hairs toward the base. The leaves are alternate in position, pinnately lobed, and ovate in shape. The leaf lobes are often asymmetrical and forked irregularly with the angles containing fine trichomes (multicellular hairs). The leaves become progressively smaller towards the inflorescence; there are often a few trichomes on the underside. The peduncles are , each with an inflorescence made up of many tiny florets; the involucre has cobwebby white hairs, and it is often slightly sticky. The purple florets can be up to long.Flora of North America, Swamp thistle, dunce-nettle, horsetops, chardon mutique, Cirsium muticum Michaux Taxonomy and naming Cirsium muticum was described by the French naturalist Andr√© Michaux in 1803. It is one of many species in the thistle genus Cirsium. The epithet muticum, meaning blunt, refers to its phyllaries. Distribution and habitat Cirsium muticum has been found across every province of Canada from Labrador and Newfoundland to Saskatchewan. In the United States, it grows primarily in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, and the Appalachians, with isolated populations scattered across the South from Texas to the Carolinas.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapBiota of North America Program 2014 state-level distribution map Cirsium muticum is found mostly in alkaline swamps, wetlands, marshes and low forests but some races have been known to grow in wet alpine climates. Ecology Cirsium muticum is as host for some species of butterflies and moths, including the swamp metalmark butterfly (Calephelis muticum), a species that is currently undergoing risk assessment in the United States. The butterfly lays its eggs on the swamp thistle, and when the eggs hatch, the flowers are the only food source for the caterpillars. It is also a larval host to the painted lady butterfly, and songbirds eat its seeds.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Species that grow with it include Aster umbellatus (flat-topped white aster), Solidago patula (rough-leaved goldenrod), Lysimachia quadrifolia (prairie loosestrife), and Gentiana procera (smaller fringed gentian). Human importance Swamp thistles can be used to make decorative arrangements. They are often planted in gardens because they are seen as more manageable than other thistles, while still potentially having some anti-herbivory properties. Conservation The plant is not endangered in Canada or the U.S. but it is threatened in the state of Arkansas, and vulnerable in the province of Saskatchewan. Cirsium muticum is at risk primarily because it is a wetland plant, and North American wetlands have been much reduced in extent over the last two centuries.

Friedhofen worked as a chimney sweep with his older brother until the latter died - this prompted Friedhofen to take care of his widow and children until he founded his own religious order in mid-1850. Pope John Paul II beatified Friedhofen in 1985. Life Peter Friedhofen was born at the beginning of 1819 on a small farm in Weitersburg as the sixth of seven children to Peter Friedhofen and Anna Maria Klug. His father died in August 1820 and his mother died in 1828. He had five other siblings which included his older brother Jakob. The death of his parents saw the children become wards of the state because no other relatives could take care of them and so a woman took three of the children in - her poverty saw that Friedhofen could not go to school. He made his First Communion at age thirteen. He joined his older brother Jakob as an apprentice chimney sweep when he turned fifteen and he worked in that capacity for a total of three years. When his brother died on 27 October 1845 - he was with the Redemptorists in Holland at the time - it was he who took care of his pregnant widow and her ten other children until suffering a lung condition that forced him to recuperate for a period of time. he met with the Bishop of Trier on 2 July 1847 and the bishop approved the Rule he had made for a new order. Father Antonio Liehs - the bishop's secretary - became his spiritual director. Friedhofen founded his own religious congregation on 21 June 1850 and a month later on 13 July travelled to Aachen while that November moving back to his hometown of Weitersburg. On 25 March 1851 he and two others were vested in their religious habits while Friedhofen took his vows in 1852 a year later. He had a bad lung condition since 1843 and each winter since 1857 could no longer visit other houses of the order outside of Koblenz. But he contracted serious tuberculosis around 1853 and it rapidly progressed. Diocesan approval for the order came on 28 February 1852. Friedhofen died in the early hours of 21 December 1860 in Koblenz after six weeks of being bedridden due to tuberculosis and was buried at the motherhouse of the order in Trier. His remains were transferred on 27 July 1928 to the order's motherhouse at Trier. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process opened in Trier on 26 March 1926 and concludes sometime later at an unknown point. The opening of the cause on 26 March 1926 under Pope Pius XI allowed for him to be titled as a Servant of God; historians later approved the direction of the cause on 6 May 1981 while the postulation submitted the Positio dossier to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1983. Theologians approved the cause on 3 May 1983 as did the C.C.S. on 5 July 1983 which allowed for Pope John Paul II to title Friedhofen as Venerable on 24 September 1983 upon the confirmation of his heroic virtue. A miracle needed for him to be beatified was investigated and then validated by the C.C.S. on 18 February 1983 which led to a medical board approving the miracle on 6 April 1984 and theologians following suit on 17 July 1984; the C.C.S. did so as well on 20 November 1984. The pope approved this on 14 December 1984 and beatified Friedhofen on 23 June 1985. References Further reading * BUNSON, Matthew; BUNSON, Margaret;BUNSON, Stephen. John Paul II, Pope.

Biography Hamlin, the son of a pewterer and brazier, was born, raised and died in Providence, Rhode Island,Andrews, p. 144 and initially followed in his father's footsteps.Bedini, p. 408-411 He was a person of respectable scientific skills, even though self-taught on his technical abilities.Malone, p. 198 Hamlin had no formal schooling in the engraving trade and made his own tools for the work in mezzotint, aquatint and stipple.Dunlap, p. 305 He did, however, have some training as an engraver under the supervision of Samuel Canfield, a goldsmith and silversmith in Middletown, Connecticut (the town where his father was born in 1746). . Upon completion of his apprenticeship, he set up business in Middletown in 1791, and returned to Providence in 1795 \\"where his principle trade was engraving\\". Hamlin was born in the year of the Gasp√©e Affair, a significant event that lead up to American Revolution. He died four years after the American Civil War in 1869. He served as a second lieutenant in the First Rhode Island militia in 1778. In 1795 when he started engraving he set up shop on North Main Street directly next door to St. John's church in Providence. He then made bank note plates. Hamlin published the first view of Providence, Rhode Island, in one of his engravings. Hamlin was a manufacturer and repairer of optical instruments, telescopes, sextants, and quadrants as a business. He was interested in astronomy and is said to have built the first telescope in the United States. One of his many telescopes he made was also available to others to study the universe. Hamlin's parents, Capt. Samuel & Thankful Ely, married in 1771. Their other children (and Hamlin's siblings) were Samuel Ely (b.1774), Ann (b.1776), Richard Ely (b. 1779), Mehitable (b.1781), Mary (b.1783), and John Hosmer (b.1787). Career Hamlin's first money making business was of selling all kinds of flutes, violins, flageolets, octave flutes, fifes and sheet music with his son (John) was first located directly across the street from the First Baptist Meetinghouse in Providence at 11 Cheapside in 1806‚Äì1809. Later he moved his business closer to the harbor eight doors south where he sold and repaired optical, nautical and mathematical instruments for the navigational industry. In 1824, Hamlin's business was listed as: \\"Hamlin William, engraver and mathematical instrument maker, 135 South Main, 170 Benefit\\". He was at 120 South Main in 1832, at 88 South Main in 1836, at 86 South Main in 1838, and at 69 South Water from 1841 to 1844. Thereafter, he relocated to 131 South Water Street, and the business was called \\"At the Sign of the Quadrant\\" advertising compasses, quadrants, sextants, spyglasses, telescopes, and microscopes. The business was there from 1847 until Hamlin's death in 1869. It was at this business that he became inspired to become an engraver. His first attempts at engraving were done on copper. Hamlin described himself strictly as a mathematical instrument maker after 1860, dropping the 'engraver' designation.The Providence Directory (1824 and later) Works Hamlin did a variety of engravings (technically etchings), most of which were done on order such as membership certificates, bank notes, bookplates, watch papers, portraits and Providence buildings. Portraits of George Washington is his most enduring legacy.Club, p. 37 He did four engravings of Washington for the 1800 publication \\"Memory of Washington\\" by Oliver Farnsworth.The bookman, p. 576 They became the object of public exhibition.See He was going to start engraving business cards as he had done for himself, but immediately became more ambitious and started engraving busts of George Washington. One was a copy of Philadelphia painter Edward Savage's bust portrait of Washington and another he did in his ninety-first year was a copy of Jean-Antoine Houdon's bust sculptor of Washington. Hamlin's print \\"The Burning of the Frigate Philadelphia in Tripoli Harbor, February 1804\\" is his most famous work. Many of Hamlin's engravings still exist and are in the form of bookplates, illustrated advertisements, marine scenes, Providence buildings and portraits. A famous specimen of his is the earliest view of Providence. He was a member of the Mechanics Association of Providence and engraved a \\"certificate of membership\\" for the members. One of his engravings shows the First Congregational Church on Benefit Street, with some flames and smoke, an indication of the fire that broke out that destroyed the church in 1814. Another notable engraving he did is that of the Experiment, a horse powered boat. He also engraved a ticket for The Experiment, entitling the bearer to a trip to New-Port or Providence. Hamlin engravings on notable people that still exist are of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, William Eaton, Stephen Gano, Isaac Watts, William H. Harrison, Enos Hitchcock, and James Manning. He is also notable for making bank note engravings for several Rhode Island banks. Clubs * Hamlin was made a member of the Freemason society of Mt. Vernon Lodge 4, A. F. and A. M.

His detective novels follow the adventures of Tom and Liz Austen, young sleuths in Canada. Wilson has taught elementary and secondary school in White Rock, British Columbia, and has a B.A. from the University of British Columbia. In 1990, he won the Arthur Ellis Award for Lifetime Achievement from The Crime Writers of Canada. The Tom and Liz Austen mysteries Originally a public school teacher, Wilson's teaching experiences pushed him into writing. Frustrated by some of his slow learners rejecting books as being too boring, Wilson decided to try writing stories himself. His first short stories were popular with his students, but publishers rejected his first five manuscripts. Wilson developed a formula based on his eighth- grade students' preferences. His books would be short, should always start with a dramatic opening scene, be dialogue heavy, and have abundant \\"cliffhanger\\" moments. Wilson's books have similarities to the Hardy Boys adventure series, but also attempt the reader participation of \\"true\\" mysteries, such as those by Agatha Christie. Wilson prominently features Canadian settings and their history in his novels. He also uses topical themes, such as environmentalism, child safety, and drug abuse, to allow teachers a springboard for classroom discussion. Criticism of Wilson's writing includes his use of improbable plotlines and somewhat stilted dialogue. The Tom and Liz Austen books have won several Canadian book world recognitions, including the Crime Writers of Canada Chairman's Award, and the Canadian Booksellers Association's Author of the Year Award in 1993. Wilson currently lives in Victoria, British Columbia.

Een van de grootste uitbraken in de geschiedenis, Gerbrand Feenstra, De Volkskrant, 18 March 1999 With at least 32 dead and 206 severe infections, it was the deadliest legionellosis outbreak since the original 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, USA. Between 19 and 28 February 1999, the Westfriese Flora took place in Bovenkarspel, one of the largest indoor flower exhibitions in the world (now the Holland Flowers Festival). A vendor had several recreational hot tubs on display, with one of them filled from a long-inactive firehose and heated to 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). In the water that had previously stagnated inside the hose, a very aggressive type of legionella pneumophila bacterium had developed. The vendor did not add chlorine to the tubs, as customers would not have been permitted in them. From 7 March, 13 patients were admitted to the Westfries Gasthuis in Hoorn. Unable to diagnose the patients, hospital staff called the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam. The AMC initially diagnosed six patients with legionellosis and a link with the Westfriese Flora was soon made. On 12 March, the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) issued an epidemic warning to all doctors and hospitals, alerting them to Flora visitors and people with pneumonia-like symptoms. In the following weeks, 318 cases throughout the Netherlands were reported to the RIVM. All patients had visited the Westfriese Flora after 22 February and had become ill between 25 February and 16 March. It is known that 32 people died of the infection, one of them in 2001 after prolonged illness. A further 206 people became severely ill and many developed permanent health problems after visiting the Flora. The 318 cases exceeds the 221 in the 1976 Philadelphia outbreak. While the Philadelphia outbreak had two more fatalities (34 versus 32), there is a possibility that others died in the 1999 Bovenkarspel outbreak, but were interred before the infection was recognized.

Jewish Virtual Library began a strike action, in which the majority of participants were women.Bunt miasta kobiet by Natalia Jarska, Tygodnik Powszechny, 12.04.2011 These events have been largely forgotten because a few weeks earlier, major protests and street fights had taken place in the cities of northern Poland. Nevertheless, the women of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ achieved what shipyard workers of the Baltic Sea coast failed to achieve - cancellation of the increase in food prices, which had been introduced by the government of Communist Poland in December 1970.≈Å√≥d≈∫.

Background  The communist government announced increases in food prices on December 12, 1970. For example the prices for meat products were raised by up to 100 percent.On cultural freedom: an exploration of public life in Poland and America By Jeffrey C. Goldfarb, page 79 Strikes and street demonstrations took place in the Baltic ports of Gda≈Ñsk, Gdynia, Szczecin, and ElblƒÖg. Security forces, together with units of the Polish Army massacred at least 42 protesting workers in December. More than 1,000 people were wounded. The news of these events quickly reached ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in spite of the government's censorship and media blackout. A tense atmosphere was palpable in the city which was the Polish center of the textile industry, where majority of workers were female. As informants of Communist secret services reported, employees of main factories talked among each other about high prices of food, desperate living conditions, and low wages. Some brought up the possibility of a strike, but in December 1970 no open protests took place. This was due to two factors - the recent news of the bloodbath in the coastal cities, and the change in the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party, where on December 20, Edward Gierek was nominated as Secretary General.Historie lodzkie, Zapomniane strajki, by Grzegorz Matuszak Nevertheless, the government did not back out of the food price increase. In January 1971, the situation in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ became even more tense. The government and the Communist Party were openly criticized, and workers in city‚Äôs textile factories talked among themselves that changes in the Polish Politburo were not enough, and that these did not guarantee that bloody events of the December 1970 protests would not be repeated in the future. Agents of the security services reported that ≈Å√≥d≈∫ workers frequently mentioned a strike - a term, which according to official propaganda was not supposed to even exist in Communist countries. Local authorities secured key buildings of the city, including the headquarters of the Communist Party, which was guarded by 70 officers of Milicja Obywatelska, 70 soldiers, and 50 officers of the paramilitary police ORMO.Krzysztof Lesiakowski. Strajk robotnik√≥w ≈Ç√≥dzkich w lutym 1971 roku. Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej ≈Å√≥d≈∫ The streets of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were patrolled by 1400 police officers, several hundred people were preventively arrested, and a special plan for a blockade of main streets was drawn up. Beginning in mid-December 1970, leaflets were distributed among the population, stating: \\"Workers! Women of ≈Å√≥d≈∫! Youth of ≈Å√≥d≈∫! We urge you to keep your cool, peace and discipline! Disorganization of your life will damage your interests! Only work, peace and order will help you to overcome current difficulties!\\".  Strikes of February 1971  First strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ began on February 10, 1971, and despite extensive preparations, the local government was caught by surprise. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was regarded in Poland as a city of women - 77% of its female residents were employed full-time. The majority of workers in the local textile industry were women, and their work was very hard, with antiquated machines (40% of all machinery was built before World War II, further 20% - before World War I.), dilapidated buildings, poor health service, little rest, three shifts, high temperature, noise, and low salaries. Women were discriminated against, they had little chance of promotion, and their supervisors were almost exclusively males, who frequently humiliated them. In 1971, salaries in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were 20% lower than the salaries in Polish heavy industry, so the increase in food prices, announced in December 1970, affected local workers to a larger degree than blue-collar laborers elsewhere. On the first day of the strike work stoppages were recorded in two major plants - Julian Marchlewski Cotton Works (which at that time employed 9,000 people), and Shoe and Rubber Factory Stomil. In Marchlewski, the strike was initiated around midday by some 400 workers, while in Stomil, 180 laborers stopped their machines. One of the reasons which precipitated the action was a TV interview with shipyard workers from the Baltic Coast, who said that as a result of their protests they had been granted a 25% pay rise. Even though official mass-media did not mention the protests, on February 12 and 13, further cotton plants joined the strike. These were: Defenders of Peace, First of May, People's Army, General Walter, Kunicki and Hanki Sawickiej. Altogether, some 12,000 workers laid down their tools, 80% of them women. Their demands were simple - wage increases and a return to the pre-December 12, 1970, food prices. Local authorities tried to negotiate, telling the strikers that their demands were impossible to meet but the talks were fruitless. On Sunday, February 14, the atmosphere at Marchlewski was very strained. Workers demanded that First Secretary of the Party, Edward Gierek, come to their factory. However, instead of the number one person in Poland, in late evening on that day a delegation from Warsaw came to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, headed by Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz. Negotiations lasted well into the night. When Jaroszewicz and his people tried to talk the women into going back to work, they answered with dramatic speeches; some cried. > I am afraid, as I want to get back home safely, but there are so many things > to do. I go to a butcher‚Äôs with 100 zlotys, I buy half a kilogram of meat, > some blood sausage and my money is gone. When I am exhausted, I go to our > factory doctor, but the supervisor calls him before I get to his office and > tells the doctor not to let me go home, because they need people to work the > machines. > \\\\- said one woman from Marchlewski Works. > I paid my rent, I paid for the kindergarten, and I do not have enough money > left to buy a candy for my child. Our kids eat black bread, while your wife > eats sandwiches. > \\\\- said a female worker of Defenders of Peace Cotton Plant. Another woman from Marchlewski, angry at the words W≈Çodzimierz Kruczek of official trades unions, pulled down her pants and showed him her buttocks. At one point, Jaroszewicz said: \\"I want to send you sincere worker's greetings from comrade Gierek. Trust us, help us!\\" In response, he heard: \\"We have got the greetings, but we have got no money\\". The strikes reached their peak on February 15.The Ashgate companion to the history of textile workers by Lex Heerma van Voss and others, page 416 The workers had acted spontaneously, without creating any formal committees. There were some loosely organized groups of activists who negotiated with authorities. Only at the Marchlewski plant an unofficial strike council was created, with 26 members. Negotiations with Jaroszewicz did not lead to an agreement, but according to the reports, a visit to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and an inquiry into the living conditions there was a shock to the Communist officials (Jaroszewicz himself admitted that he did not know that the situation was so bad.). Meanwhile, the strike spread. On Monday, February 15, three other factories joined the protest, and the number of strikers grew to 55,000. Unlike the events of December 1970, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ workers did not go out onto the streets, and decided to remain in their factories, so no street fights took place. Female employees used a powerful argument while negotiating with the authorities - they frequently mentioned their children and the inability to feed and clothe them properly. In one instance, there was an attempt to barricade streets around the Marchlewski plant. 500 - 1000 people gathered there, stopped the traffic, and overturned dumpsters as well as benches. Some skirmishes with the police ensued, and soon afterwards, fighting moved to Piotrkowska Street. The police attacked the protesters with water cannons, batons and tear gas, arresting 30 people. Otherwise, crews of factories tried to keep order, checking all the people who entered through the gates.  Aftermath  After Jaroszewicz‚Äôs visit and a subsequent meeting of the Politburo, on February 15, 1971, the government decided to cancel the increase in food prices, which came into effect on March 1, 1971.Historia gospodarcza Polski by Andrzej Jezierski, page 503 Upon hearing of this decision most of the strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ended. Still, workers were distrustful of the government, demanding written confirmation of the decision. Finally, all strikes ended on the morning of February 17, with the two last textile plants ‚Äì Defenders of Peace, and Feliks Dzier≈ºy≈Ñski returning to work. After the end of the strikes, the authorities tried to find and punish the leaders. By March 5, 1971, 26 workers of the Marchlewski, and 11 of the Defenders of Peace were identified and forced to quit. Furthermore, Communist leaders were incensed to find out that the workers of Marchlewski collected money for a commemorative flag, with the inscription: Thank you, Holy Mother, for your protection on February 10‚Äì15, 1971. The flag is now kept at Saint Joseph church in ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on February 12, 2012. In the episode, the survivors deal with the aftermath of the barn shooting, which causes Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) to order Rick's group to leave and then start drinking and disappear from the group, leading Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) to try to find him. Meanwhile, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) becomes more suspicious of Shane Walsh's (Jon Bernthal) actions. \\"Nebraska\\" was written by Evan Reilly and directed by Clark Johnson. Two trailers were released as part of promoting the episode; the former aired shortly after the broadcast of its predecessor, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\", while the latter premiered a month preceding the airing of \\"Nebraska\\". Following the broadcast of the episode, The Walking Dead took a three-month hiatus from television. It features guest appearances from Michael Raymond- James and Aaron Munoz, as well as appearances from several recurring actors and actresses including Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, Emily Kinney and IronE Singleton. The episode received general acclaim from television critics, who praised the episode's concluding scene alongside the character development and storylines. Upon airing, it attained 8.10 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. \\"Nebraska\\" achieved the strongest demographic ratings out of any basic cable telecast in history until the airing of the series' second-season finale. The episode became the highest-rated basic cable television program of the day, as well as the most- viewed cable program of the week. This episode marks the final appearance of Madison Lintz (Sophia Peletier). Plot With all the walkers subdued from Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s barn, Hershel demands Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group leave the farm. Rick confronts Shane (Jon Bernthal) regarding his actions leading to this, but Shane considers Rick as delusional as Hershel and berates him for wasting time. The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning the rest of the walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going off into the woods to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that he had no idea Sophia was in the barn. Hershel throws out his wife's belongings and then disappears. His absence is not noted until his younger daughter Beth (Emily Kinney) collapses and goes into a catatonic state. Hershel's family believes he may have started drinking again. As the others tend to Beth, Rick and Glenn (Steven Yeun) travel to a nearby town to look for Hershel. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) talks to the others to try to get a sense of Shane's actions. He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his suspicion that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may kill someone else soon. As Beth's condition worsens, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned. In the town, Rick and Glenn find Hershel alone in a tavern, drinking and lamenting the loss of his family members. Rick eventually convinces Hershel to return, but as they are about to leave, two suspicious men from Philadelphia enter the bar‚ÄîDave (Michael Raymond-James) and Tony (Aaron Munoz). They reveal that Rick's goal of Fort Benning may be overridden and try to goad where the group's farm is, looking for safe haven. Rick refuses to disclose the farm's location. The two men try to kill Rick, who shoots both of them before they fire back on him. The episode ends with the remaining group burning the rest of the walkers. Production \\"Nebraska\\" was written by Evan Reilly and directed by Clark Johnson. Following the broadcast of the previous installment, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\", The Walking Dead took a three-month hiatus from television. Two trailers were released as part of an advertising campaign for the episode; the first was broadcast after \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\" aired, while the second aired in January 2012. A promotional image was released shortly thereafter, which featured Rick Grimes holding up a gun at Sophia. The first three minutes of \\"Nebraska\\" were leaked online. The episode introduces two new characters to the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although they were killed off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. \\"With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really trying to convince the audience that they were going to be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking.\\" Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. \\"I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg,\\" he stated. \\"It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.\\". \\"The Regulator\\" by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence. Johnson devised the scene in which Rick shot and killed Dave and Tony in a bar, and presented it to Reilly. Johnson sought to authorize man's animalistic qualities during a state of disaster. Note: Event occurs at time 0:20‚Äì1:05. Reilly contacted showrunner Glen Mazzara via cell phone, and wanted to add the scene to the episode's script. \\"That was an incredible scene,\\" reflected Lincoln. \\"We were so lucky to get such cracking actors. And we didn't play the problem, we just played the fact that this is a reunion of human beings. The tension is inherent in the fact that they encounter this other group.\\" \\"Nebraska\\" contains a stunt sequence, in which Lori Grimes slams into a walker, causing her to swerve on the side of the road and overturn her car. Kirkman said of the scene: \\"I had nothing to do with it. But it did turn out really well. I love the trailers for this season where it's like, \\"This is happening: People shooting guns! Cars are flipping!'\\" Title reference Tony shares with Rick the rumors survivor groups have circulated about safe destinations. Nebraska is one such rumored location, considered safe ‚Äì Dave explains ‚Äì because of its low population and numerous guns. When Rick refuses safe haven at the farm to Dave and Tony, Dave asks where else he would suggest they go. Rick's reply, \\"I don't know, I hear Nebraska's nice\\", triggers Tony and Dave to draw their guns on Rick, who shoots them first. Nebraska was also notable as \\"Ground Zero\\" (i.e., the target of) Russian nuclear bombs in the 1950s and '60s, in the event of a nuclear war. Therefore, the Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA) devised plans that would give civilians a chance to survive a nuclear war, and cartons of \\"Nebraskits\\" (compressed biscuits made from grain) and dairy-based milk bars, collectively designed to satisfy survivors' nutritional requirements during a stay in a fallout shelter, were stored in fallout shelters throughout the United States. Reception Ratings \\"Nebraska\\" was originally broadcast on February 12, 2012 in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode garnered 8.10 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic, making it the most-viewed episode of the series thus far. Following two encore presentations, total viewership accumulated to 10.1 million. The episode attained 5.4 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic, while subsequently obtaining 4.4 million viewers in the 25‚Äì54 demographic; this makes \\"Nebraska\\" the highest-rated basic cable telecast in history demographically up until the airing of the second-season finale, \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\". The accolade was previously held by the second-season premiere, \\"What Lies Ahead\\", which received 4.8 million spectators amongst adults in the 18-49 demographic and 4.2 million viewers in the 25‚Äì54 demographic. \\"Nebraska\\" became the highest-rated basic cable program of the day, as well as the most- watched basic cable telecast of the week dated February 12. Ratings and total viewership increased significantly from the previous installment, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\", which garnered 6.62 million viewers and a 3.5 ratings amongst key adults between 18 and 49. \\"Nebraska\\" debuted in 122 countries worldwide in 35 languages. In the United Kingdom, the episode garnered 737,200 viewers thus making it the most-viewed television program of the week on FX. \\"Nebraska\\" attracted a 3.05 rating in the 18-49 demographic, translating to 558,400 viewers. It subsequently becoming the highest-rated telecast on pay television. Similarly, \\"Nebraska\\" achieved the highest demographic ratings out of any pay television program in Spain and Italy, where it attained a 3.93 rating (193,080 viewers) and a 3.26 rating (215,264) in the 18-49 demographic, respectively. In Spain, the episode received 330,000 viewers and aired simultaneously with an episode of Castle, ultimately outperforming it by 78%. In Italy, it obtained 328,180 spectators, denoting a 19% increase from \\"What Lies Ahead\\". \\"Nebraska\\" performed well demographically in several Latin American countries. In Chile, the episode garnered a 0.78 in the 18-49 demographic, thereby becoming the highest-rated telecast on pay television there. It outperformed its timeslot in that respective demographic by 136%. Similarly, \\"Nebraska\\" outperformed the timeslot average by 24% in Argentina, ultimately attaining a 0.88 rating amongst adults in the 18-49 group. In Mexico and Colombia, the episode obtained a 2.19 rating and a 1.07 rating in the 18-49 demographic, respectively. Critical response The character development of Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies, pictured) was panned by critics. \\"Nebraska\\" was widely lauded by television commentators. Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen felt that the episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were \\"beautifully acted\\". In his A‚Äì review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that \\"Nebraska\\" accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere for the second half of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience \\"plenty to chew on\\", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; \\"'Nebraska' doesn‚Äôt entirely rectify this concern, but it‚Äôs a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed.\\" Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; \\"I liked how this episode thrust us right back into it, and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing‚Äîa mixture this show can do very well.\\" Concluding his review, Goldman issued \\"Nebraska\\" an eight out of ten, signifying a \\"great\\" rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: \\"'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating things that happened earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...]. But just when it looks as though the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, \\"Nebraska\\" surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead.\\" Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that \\"Nebraska\\" was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was \\"just one huge whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it\\", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode. Commentators criticized the character development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development intended for the scene. He stated, \\"The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted as she looked at a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, but it could have been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all.\\" Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a \\"jaw-dropping moment\\". Critics adulated the character development of Rick Grimes, as well as the concluding scene of \\"Nebraska\\". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: \\"Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn‚Äôt find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger.\\" Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming \\"something of a badass\\". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. \\"This is one of the best scenes I‚Äôve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past,\\" he opined. \\"The tension builds naturally [...], the dialogue has actual subtext, and there‚Äôs a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself.\\" Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. \\"There are characters with new information [...],\\" Meslow commented. \\"There is dialogue with subtext [...]. There is intriguing parallel plotting [...]. And there's the surprisingly swift, violent d√©nouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order.\\" HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was \\"as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters\\". Jeffrey complimented Bernthal's performance, while Josh Wigler of MTV celebrated his scene with DeMunn. Wigler summated: \\"Jon Bernthal and Jeffrey DeMunn are very likely the finest actors on The Walking Dead, and their increasingly tense interactions have been a highlight in recent episodes. 'Nebraska' was no exception, with Shane giving Dale an earful about 'Barnageddon' and why he did what he had to do.\\" References External links *\\"Nebraska\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ","title":"Nebraska (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"33997008","text":"Kalinke is an unincorporated community located in the town of Easton, Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States.

It has been developed into several variants from 2001 to 2007. Design and development The Okhotonik light autogyro first flew around 2002. It has since been developed through four distinct variants, the changes involving different model Subaru piston engines, several types and diameters of rotors, enclosed accommodation and some alterations to the tail. Most have been three seat models, though two seaters have been made and at least one flight demonstrated the ability of the Okhotnik to lift five people. The Okhotnik is based on a low beam carrying seats, cabin, engine and tail. The three seats are arranged with the pilot alone in front and two close placed seats behind. The engine and rotor pylon are immediately behind the rear seats. The cabin of the Okhotnik 2M and 3 variants is rounded and largely glazed, with side access doors. A two blade rotor with a gust-correcting vane just below its hub rotates freely above a support pylon, though it can be hydraulically pre-rotated for jump starts. The Subaru engine drives a five blade propeller of radius 950 mm (37.4 in), its tips passing close to the fuselage beam. Two tall, narrow chord tail surfaces are mounted at the end of this beam, at right angles to it but splaying outwards to form a V-Tail. They are supported at the top by an arched transverse member, itself attached by straight struts to the rotor pylon. On the Okhotnik 3 the top of a third, vertical and forward leaning tail surface is attached to this arch, its lower end held aft of the other tail surfaces on a strut to the fuselage beam. Operational history The Okhotnik 2M appeared at the 2005 Moscow Salon in 2005 and the Okhotnik 3 at the same event in 2007. The latter gained its Certificate of Airworthiness in October 2007.

The school opened in September 2011 as one of the first free schools in the country and also the first Montessori free school. The school was funded directly by central government and had a planned intake of 16 pupils per year. Although the school adopted Montessori methods, the Montessori Schools Association (MSA) later said that they were refused permission to oversee the introduction of its teaching methods and had \\"warned the DfE of the school's likely failure\\" in 2010 before the school opened. Philip Bujak, chief executive of the MSA, said: \\"We were ignored completely.\\" Martin Bradley, chairman of the MSA, said: \\"The Montessori Schools Association has had limited contact with the school from the start of the scheme. We suggested that they seek accreditation, but they did not.\\" While not formally affiliated with any religious organisation, Discovery New School followed an Anglican ethos and was one of four \\"faith schools\\" in the first batch of free schools approved by the education secretary, Michael Gove, along with a Hindu school in Leicester, a Christian primary school in Camden, North London, and a Jewish primary school in Mill Hill, North London. The school closed to children for the last time on 3 April 2014, following a series of inspection failures and withdrawal of its funding. School building Discovery New School was located in Broadfield House, a 19th-century villa-style house in the Broadfield neighbourhood of Crawley. Built in 1830 on the extensive land of the Tilgate Estate south of the town, it was extended later in the 19th century and converted into a country club. It was subsequently used as the headquarters of the Crawley Development Corporation. The house, which is still set in parkland, was refurbished and converted for use by the school in 2011, at a cost of ¬£1.9 million. It has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. Teacher qualifications Discovery New School attracted media commentary when co-founder and school business director Andrew Snowdon revealed that he was \\"not obliged to employ qualified teachers\\" at the school and planned to employ teachers with a \\"mix of skills\\" including some with Qualified Teacher Status, some with Montessori training and some unqualified teachers and instructors. Alasdair Smith, of the Anti Academies Alliance, said: \\"The idea that free schools might not use qualified teachers would be very worrying for most parents because QTS is evidence that the teacher understands how to provide quality teaching and learning.\\" Christine Blower, general secretary at the National Union of Teachers, said: \\"The NUT believes children deserve to be taught by qualified teachers. If the department decides free schools do not have to employ qualified teachers, it is a dereliction of their duties.\\" Ofsted inspection Following an inspection in May 2013 by government watchdog Ofsted (the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) Discovery New School was rated \\"inadequate\\" and inspectors warned that \\"too many pupils are in danger of leaving the school without being able to read and write properly.\\" The report said: \\"The headteacher lacks the skills and knowledge to improve teaching... Too much teaching is inadequate, and the headteacher has an over-optimistic view of its quality.\\" Inspectors also expressed concerns that too many children were being assessed as having special educational needs when \\"some of them simply need better teaching.\\" (As of September 2013, out of 48 students 25% had SEN statements or were on School Action Plus.) It was the first free school to fail an Ofsted inspection, and also the first to be placed under special measures, a status applied to schools which fail to supply an acceptable level of education and lack the leadership capacity necessary to secure improvements. Schools under special measures are subject to regular, unannounced inspections. A further Ofsted inspection in September 2013 led to head teacher and co-founder Lindsey Snowdon's suspension \\"after failing to create an adequate improvement plan for the school.\\" The inspection report said: \\"It is essential that a credible professional is appointed to the headship without delay to provide the expert leadership necessary to remove the school from special measures\\" and that the draft 'statement of action' and improvement plan put forward by the head teacher and the business director were \\"not fit for purpose.\\" The school governors appointed Penny Crocker, a head teacher with specialist experience in improving failing schools, as interim head teacher on 9 October 2013. Closure In November 2013 Lord Nash, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools, wrote to the school governors that he was \\"extremely concerned about the quality of education children are receiving\\" and that \\"very little progress has been made since the school was placed in special measures.\\" On 13 December 2013 the DfE announced: \\"Since the school was placed in special measures by Ofsted in May we have monitored progress closely. The trust has not provided evidence they are making the changes required. Lord Nash has today notified the trust that the department will terminate its funding agreement at the end of the [2014] spring term. We are now working with West Sussex County Council to ensure the children affected have suitable alternatives in place and their transition is as smooth as possible.\\" Lord Nash said: \\"We know from inspection evidence that teaching and learning is inadequate in DNS, and that there has been little or no improvement since Ofsted's judgement that the school required special measures in May. The number and nature of the actions and milestones to be achieved demonstrates that the staff are currently unable to deliver teaching and learning even at the most basic level with the consequence for the pupils of continued inadequate teaching for an unacceptable length of time. Further, the training implication for staff is enormous. It is difficult to see how they would be able to attend all the training listed and at the same time provide adequate teaching for the pupils.\\" The governors issued a statement expressing deep disappointment at the decision and said that they did not believe they had been \\"given enough time... to deliver improvements.\\" Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said: \\"In his terrible rush to roll out the free school programme, David Cameron has abandoned high standards and basic safeguards and the pupils at the Discovery Free School have paid the price. David Cameron is damaging standards by allowing free schools to operate under a complete lack of local oversight, transparency and accountability and by allowing them to hire unqualified teachers.\\" The schools founders \\"were sacked\\" and DNS became the Government's first free school to be closed on 3 April 2014.

Canada (Attorney General), 2010 SCC 60, [2010] 3 SCR 379 is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that describes the interrelationship between the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in governing Canadian insolvency law, and how other federal statutes are accordingly construed. Facts Ted LeRoy Trucking Ltd was one of the largest independent logging contractors on Vancouver Island. In December 2007, it was notified that, as it was in breach of certain loan covenants, its outstanding loans had to be immediately repaid. The company filed for protection under the CCAA. The court authorized LeRoy to dispose of certain redundant assets. Century Services Inc was one of the major secured creditors of LeRoy. In April 2008, the court authorized a payment to Century not to exceed $5 million from the proceeds of disposal. As LeRoy also owed a significant liability with respect to Goods and Services Tax, it proposed that an amount equal to the liability be held back from the payment to Century and kept in the Monitor's trust account until the outcome of the reorganization was known. The court agreed and so ordered. In September 2008, LeRoy concluded that reorganization was not possible, and accordingly applied for an assignment into bankruptcy. The Crown applied to have the holdback released for payment and remitted to settle the GST liability. The issue Under the Excise Tax Act, GST that is collected is deemed to be held in trust for the Crown, and that this takes precedence over any other statute other than the BIA. However, the CCAA states that, subject to certain exceptions (none of which relate to GST), deemed trusts do not exist in its proceedings. There was certain jurisprudence that held that the ETA took precedence. Was that correct? The judgments below The British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that, as the funds were being held pending the emergence of a viable reorganization plan, the fact that this was unsuccessful meant that the Crown would lose its priority as a result of the assignment into bankruptcy. Accordingly, the Crown's application was dismissed. This order was overturned on appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The court unanimously held: * the court at first instance did not have the authority to dismiss the Crown's application, as the ETA's priority scheme took effect once the likelihood of a successful reorganization plant had ceased to be * the judge's original order had created an express trust for the Crown, and the funds could not be diverted for any other purpose. Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada The Court of Appeal's decision was reversed. The following were identified as the key issues in the appeal: * did the ETA displace the CCAA by giving priority to the Crown's deemed trust in CCAA proceedings? * did the court exceed its authority under the CCAA by lifting the stay to allow the debtor to make an assignment into bankruptcy? * did the court's April 2008 order create an express trust in favour of the Crown with respect to the GST holdback? The court held that: * the CCAA and BIA form an interrelated insolvency scheme for Canada, and the ETA is subordinate to that scheme * the court of first instance has wide discretionary authority under the CCAA, which must be interpreted having regard to the remedial nature of the CCAA and insolvency legislation generally * no express trust was created by the court's order Purpose and scope of insolvency law As this was the first time a case relating to the CCAA had been heard by the Supreme Court - which it acknowledged in its decision - a detailed analysis was given in explaining the nature of insolvency law in Canada. The BIA provides a more rules-based approach for resolving a corporate debtor's insolvency, which must be observed strictly. The CCAA, on the other hand, provides a more discretionary approach that is remedial in nature, which therefore must be broadly construed. Although the CCAA was originally enacted in 1933, extensive use of it only began in the economic downturn of the early 1980s. Recent legislative amendments of the BIA and CCAA have served to harmonize key aspects, such as the use of single proceedings, a common priority of claims structure, and encouraging reorganization over liquidation. GST deemed trust under the CCAA The Parliament of Canada's recent legislative activity has tended to favour the diminishing of the Crown's priority in BIA and CCAA proceedings, and both have been expressly amended accordingly. As the ETA does not contain such express language on the subject, it must be construed within the framework of the insolvency statutes. Discretionary power of a court in a CCAA reorganization This is noted together with s. 11 of the CCAA, which states that a court may, \\"subject to the restrictions set out in this Act, . . . make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances\\". The decision notes the interrelated nature of proceedings under the CCAA and BIA: Accordingly, the supervising judge had the necessary authority to make the order he did. Express trusts Creation of an express trust requires the presence of three certainties: intention, subject matter, and object. There was no certainty that the Crown would actually be the beneficiary, or object, of the trust. Therefore, no express trust was created in this instance. Significance Apart from an initial reference question in 1933 on the validity of the CCAA, this was the first time that an appeal had been heard by the Supreme Court. Until now, Canadian jurisprudence in this area came from the various provincial courts of appeal. Century Services was the first opportunity to explain the complete nature of Canadian insolvency law and how each of the statutes work within that framework. The CCAA and BIA must not be viewed in isolation, as they have many features that form part of a harmonized structure. Therefore, forum shopping is discouraged and single proceedings are preferred. Because of their harmonized nature, other federal statutes must be accordingly construed. A court must first interpret the text of the CCAA, and only then may the court look to fill in legislative \\"gaps\\" pursuant to its inherent or equitable jurisdiction. In exercising CCAA authority, the court is to bear in mind the requirements of appropriateness, good faith and due diligence as baseline considerations. As to appropriateness, the court is to inquire whether the order sought advances the public policy objectives of the CCAA ‚Äì avoiding the social and economic losses resulting from a liquidation.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Early life Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Erma Bergmann was one of three children into the family of Otto and Sophie Bergmann. Her father was a packinghouse butcher, while her mother, a ragtime pianist, wanted her only daughter to take piano lessons. But Erma declined, preferring to play sandlot ball with her two brothers and other neighborhood kids. At fourteen, she began playing at third base in the St. Louis Amateur Softball League since other opportunities at school were limited. At fifteen, she played shortstop for the Melbas, a girl's softball team at St. Louis Park, and pitched for the Phantoms, a boy's baseball team, pitching ten straight victories.St. Louis Star-Times After eight years of experience, she was recruited by an AAGPBL scout that followed her for three years before signing a contract to play after graduation. Career Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the AAGPBL created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball. Over the twelve years of history of the league, the rules were gradually modified to more closely resemble baseball. Throwing underhand, Bergmann was one of the few AAGPBL hurlers to pitch all three styles in the league's history, being able to make the transition to full sidearm in 1947 and overhand pitching in 1948.AAGPBL Rules of Play Bergmann entered the league in 1946 with the expansion Muskegon Lassies, playing for them two years before joining the Springfield Sallies (1948), Racine Belles (1949‚Äì1950) and Battle Creek Belles (1951). In her rookie season, Bergmann posted a 15‚Äì16 record and a 2.05 earned run average in 35 pitching appearances, top numbers for the sixth-place Lassies. She also spent time at outfield, hitting a .255 average in 50 games. Her biggest thrill in her season debut came when she belted her only career home run in the top of the ninth inning of a game against the Rockford Peaches. She then shut down the Peaches in the bottom of the inning for a victory with her parents in attendance. In 1947 the AAGPBL moved its spring training camp to Havana, Cuba, and Bergmann was one of the two hundred girls who made the trip. That season she was used strictly as a pitcher. She ended the season with an 11‚Äì10 mark and a solid 1.74 ERA in 27 games, helping the Lassies win the pennant. In addition, she tossed a no-hitter against the host Grand Rapids Chicks on May 22 of that year. For the rest of her career, Bergmann played for awful teams and her season records reflect reflected it. She went 9‚Äì19 in 1948, though she recorded a 3.05 ERA. Then, she finished 11‚Äì14 with a 2.09 ERA in 1949, and went 11‚Äì14 with a 2.68 ERA in 1950. Her worst season came in 1951, when she went 7‚Äì18 with a 3.92 ERA while leading the league in losses, runs allowed (119) and earned runs (87). It would be her last year in the league.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League After that, Bergmann moved to Chicago and played in the rival National Girls Baseball League from 1952 to 1954. During this stint, she tied two league records by pitching a 23-inning game and hitting five singles in a game. Later career Following her baseball career, Bergmann became one of the first commissioned police women in the city of St. Louis.

Spent upper stages are generally passivated after their use as launch vehicles is complete, as are satellites when they can no longer be used for their design purpose. Internally stored energy generally takes the form of unused propellant and batteries. In the past, such stored energy has sometimes led to fragmentation or explosion, producing unwanted space debris. This was a fairly common ultimate outcome for many of the legacy US50-Year Old Rocket Stage Involved in Orbital Debris Event, Spaceflight 101. and Soviet rocket designs of the 1960s‚Äì1980s.A. Rossi et al, \\"Effects of the RORSAT NaK Drops on the Long Term Evolution of the Space Debris Population\\", University of Pisa, 1997. However, the problem of derelict second stages left to orbit long-term in higher Earth orbits breaking up has not totally gone away; several US rocket stages fragmented in just the last two years of the 2010s. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and United Nations (UN) recommend that satellites in geosynchronous orbit be designed to move themselves to a disposal orbit some above the GEO belt, and then remove internally stored energy. Most GEO satellites conform to these recommendations, although there are no enforcement mechanisms. Standard practices Within national regimes, where national governments can control the launch licenses of launch vehicles and spacecraft, there are some enforceable requirements for passivation. The US government has implemented a set of standard practices for both civilian (NASA) and military (DoD/USAF) orbital debris mitigation that require passivation for space launches with US launch licenses. \\"All on-board sources of stored energy of a spacecraft or upper stage should be depleted or safed when they are no longer required for mission operations or postmission disposal. Depletion should occur as soon as such an operation does not pose an unacceptable risk to the payload. Propellant depletion burns and compressed gas releases should be designed to minimize the probability of subsequent accidental collision and to minimize the impact of a subsequent accidental explosion.\\" Passivation practice on many launches in recent decades has not mitigated second stage breakups. Upper stage deflagration/breakup events have continued even with newer rocket designs of the 2010s, long after the negative externality of space debris became widely considered as a much larger social problem. For example, there were three upper stage breakups in just the late 2010s: * 30 August 2018: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on 17 September 2014 broke up, creating space debris. * 23‚Äì25 March 2018: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on 8 September 2009 broke up. * 6 April 2019: Atlas V Centaur passivated second stage launched on 17 October 2018 broke up.

It won the 2011 Believer Book Award. Story The first- person narrator of the novel, Adam Gordon, is an American poet in his early 20s participating in a prestigious fellowship in Madrid circa 2004. The stated goal of his fellowship is to write a long narrative poem highlighting literature's role in the Spanish Civil War. Gordon, however, spends his time reading Tolstoy, smoking spliffs, and observing himself observing his surroundings. He also pursues romantic and sexual relationships with two Spanish women, lying to them and others to elicit sympathy and avoid responsibility. He tells several people that his mother has recently died, recounts a friend's experience of a failed attempt to rescue a drowned woman as if it was his own, and uses his (sometimes feigned) lack of Spanish fluency to falsely suggest that his thoughts are too profound and complex to convey outside of his native language. Especially when called upon to participate in poetry readings or discussion panels, Gordon grapples with feelings of fraudulence and anxiety. Leaving the Atocha Station can be read as a K√ºnstlerroman. However, Lerner has said: > The protagonist doesn't unequivocally undergo a dramatic transformation, for > instance, but rather the question of \\"transformation\\" is left open, and > people seem to have strong and distinct senses about whether the narrator > has grown or remained the same, whether this is a sort of coming of age > story or whether it charts a year in the life of a sociopath. References to Ashbery The title of the novel is taken from a John Ashbery poem of the same name published in The Tennis Court Oath. During his time in Spain, Gordon often carries Ashbery's Selected Poems. At one point in the novel, Gordon reads a selection from Selected Poems. \\"The best Ashbery poems, I thought, although not in these words, describe what it's like to read an Ashbery poem.\\" Ashbery called Lerner's Leaving the Atocha Station \\"[a]n extraordinary novel about the intersections of art and reality in contemporary life.\\" Critical reception The New Statesman named it one of the best books of 2011.http://www.newstatesman.com/2011/11/ben-lerner-atocha-station The New Yorker included it in its Reviewers' Favorites from 2011.

Uppland Runic Inscription 171 or U 171 is the Rundata catalog listing for a Viking Age memorial runestone that is located in S√∂derby, which is four kilometers west of Vaxholm, Stockholm County, Sweden, and in the historic province of Uppland. Description The inscription on U 171 consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on a serpent that follows the edge of the triangular-shaped granite stone. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The inscription was carved by a runemaster who used the signature Fasti, with the runes for his signature line fasti risti runa Ä or \\"Fasti carved the runes\\" located outside of the serpent near its leg. Based on stylistic analysis, this runemaster is believed to have also created the nearby but now-lost runestone U 170 in Bogesund, where the runemaster's signature was recorded as being Fastulfr. As such, Fasti may be a nickname. On U 171, the runemaster used a word divider punctuation mark consisting of a single dot between each word that was carved on the serpent. The runic text states that the stone was raised by a man named Gunni in memory of his son Eyndr and in memory of himself. It is believed that this stone is associated with three other nearby runestones that were raised by the same family, the others being U 166 and 167 in √ñstra Ryds and U 170 in Bogesund. There are over twenty other runestones where the sponsor of the stone stated that the stone was raised in memory of himself, including S√∂ 55 in Bjudby, U 127 in Danderyds, the now-lost U 149 in Hagby, U 164 and U 165 in T√§by, U 194 in V√§sby, U 212 in Vallentuna, U 261 in Fresta, U 308 in Ekeby, the now-lost U 345 in Ytterg√§rde, U 433 in Husby-√Ñrlinghundra, U 734 in Linsunda, U 739 in G√•di, U 803 in L√•ngtora, U 962 in Vaksala, U 1011 in √ñrby, U 1040 in Fasma, the now-lost U 1114 in Myrby, U 1181 in Lilla Runh√§llen, U Fv1958;250 in Sigtuna, Vs 17 in R√•by, Vs 32 in Pr√§stg√•rden, and DR 212 in Tillitse.

Renzi graduated from Queens College and from the Cooper Union Art School, New York. In 1953, she relocated to Paris, France where she lived for the rest of her life. Grace Renzi was a painter, and a printmaker. Her art is part of collections (public or private) and galleries, and has been exhibited throughout the world in solo shows, group shows, and 'salons' on a regular basis. She was married to the composer Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er. She is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.  Life  Joy of Sunshine (1951, New York), by Grace Renzi The tomb of Grace Renzi and Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er in P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery. Grace Renzi was born on September 9, 1922 in New York, in the borough of Queens, very close to the East River. She was the last of the eleven children of Michael (Michelangelo) Renzi and his wife Lucy, born Lucia Viscusi. The parents, both from farmer families from the Province of Benevento in Italy, had settled in New York around 1900. The mother was a housewife and the father a laborer. In 1923, the family moved near Belmont Park, still in Queens. The Great Depression did not affect Renzi too much and she enjoyed an education followed by her older sisters, several of whom were teachers. Renzi had the opportunity to draw and paint at will since childhood, which she devoted herself to. She was always an excellent pupil and received scholarships throughout her education. In 1940, at the age of eighteen, Renzi entered Cooper Union. After one year at Cooper, she decided in 1941 to study first at Queens College, where she worked for instance with Vaclav Vytlacil, and Robert Goldwater in the history of art. In 1944, Renzi graduated cum laude. After the end of World War II, Renzi returned to Cooper Union where she studied notably with Mrs and Mr Harrison, Morris Kantor and Nicholas Marsicano. She graduated in 1948, cum laude, and also took advantage of Hans Hofmann's teaching, though briefly. Renzi exhibited in shows and group exhibitions, especially in New York (see the hidden box at the bottom of the page). Determined to visit the museums of Europe, she works to finance this project. Renzi taught art history at Hofstra University in 1950‚Äì51 and was also an assistant at Cooper. In 1951, Renzi went to Cuba and stayed there one year. While teaching, she discovers the island and mingled with the arts community, thus meeting Wifredo Lam and his artistic universe. The first solo exhibition of Renzi's work took place in Havana, followed by another one in 1952.Edmundo Desnoes and Juan Barcelo Arcocha published reviews for the exhibitions in Havana. Renzi was able to use the atelier of Wifredo Lam as he was absent in 1952. She remained in contact with Lam in Paris, and later also visited him in Albissola, Italy. Back to New York and having gotten over hepatitis, she teaches again to finance her trip to Europe. She arrived in Paris in September 1953 and got to know the artistic milieu of the time. In Montparnasse, Renzi met the Slovenian composer Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er who became her husband.Throughout their careers, their works are related. The painter and composer often deal with the same \\"subjects\\", such those that inspired Kantu≈°er in the ballets. Also, reproductions of original drawings by Renzi adorn some manuscript publications by Kantu≈°er, the String Quartet ‚Ññ 1, the Chamber Symphony. The couple moved to the R√©publique quarter. In 1955, their son Borut was born. That same year, Renzi participates in a group exhibition at the Galerie du Dragon, her first exhibition in Paris. During the winter of 1956‚Äì57, Renzi went to New York after her mother died. In 1957, back in France and in order to support the family, she took a full-time job in a U.S. Army school in Bordeaux. The first solo exhibition in Europe of Renzi's works took place in Bordeaux.The exhibition took place at the American Cultural Center. It was welcomed by the critics and followed by a participation in a group exhibition at the City gallery of Fine Arts, again in Bordeaux. In 1958, Renzi exhibited in Paris at the gallery L'Antipo√®te, notably alongside Jean-Michel Atlan, Jean Fautrier, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff and Sigismond Kolos-Vary. At the end of 1958, the family moved to Fontainebleau, where Renzi continued with her teaching job. In 1962, Renzi participated in the exhibition \\"Donner √† voir 2\\" at the Galerie Creuze in Paris, which was accompanied by a review by Jos√© Pierre. This exhibition included the following painters: Eva Aeppli, Joyce Mansour, Mimi Parent, Grace Renzi, Sabine, Niki de Saint Phalle, Toyen, Ursula, and Mary Wilson. During the 1960s, the Fontainebleau years, Renzi had quite a spacious atelier and while enjoying the closeness of nature, she was able to stay in touch with the cultural life of the capital. From 1962 on, she exhibited regularly in various Parisian salons. In 1964, a solo exhibition of works by Renzi at the Marie-Jacqueline Dumay gallery, in Paris, was accompanied by a text, \\"L'Inesp√©r√©\\" by Jean-Clarence Lambert. Renzi also kept in touch with her family in the United States, making and receiving visits. In 1968 her first exhibition in Yugoslavia took place in Portoro≈æ. In 1969, Renzi co-organized an exhibition at the B.I.M.C., at the villa Lavaurs in Fontainebleau. This exhibition notably included Roberto Altmann, John Christoforou, Pranas Gailius, Jacques H√©rold, Sigismond Kolos-Vary, Wifredo Lam, Grace Renzi, Emil Wachter and Karel Zelenko, and was encouraged by Jean Bouret in Les Lettres Fran√ßaises. In 1969, Renzi began teaching at the Marymount International School, in Neuilly.Taught art, until the age of retirement. In 1970, Renzi was invited to participate in two exhibitions in Yugoslavia, in Rijeka and Piran. During the 1970s, the family spent the summers in Gro≈ænjan, where they joined a colony of artists that brought this Istrian town back to life.From 1968 and until 1979, the Kantusers spend the summer months in Gro≈ænjan where a colony of artists was eager to restore the houses and enjoy the space and the natural and cultural environment. From 1971 to 1978, the ground floor of the house they occupied was a gallery where Renzi would exhibit her work. In 1975, the exhibition for the \\"10 years of Gro≈ænjan\\" gathered the artists Janez Boljka, Peter ƒåerne, Janez Pirnat, Grace Renzi, Ivan Seljak-ƒåopiƒç, Jo≈æe Spacal and Karel Zelenko. Renzi participates in group exhibitions by Gro≈ænjan artists, in Gro≈ænjan itself and also in Piran or Subotica. In 1971, the Kantu≈°ers left Fontainebleau and returned to Paris, living first in the Bastille quarter, then Rue de Rome. In 1972, Renzi had a solo exhibition at the American Center, in Paris, and in 1972 and 1973, she projected stained glass windows for the Monpazier chapel, in the southwest of France.The stained glass windows were made in cooperation with the master glassmaker Louis Franch√©o with which Renzi worked again in 1976 for stained glass windows in Moissac. In the 1960s, in Fontainebleau, Renzi had already been in talks about church stained glass windows, a project for which she had been recommended by Fran√ßois Mathey. From 1973 to 1976, Renzi was a resident at the Cit√© internationale des arts in ParisAt the Cit√© des Arts, Renzi also participated in the annual group exhibitions (until the 1990s). Renzi later also applied for an atelier at Westbeth, and was awarded a residency in 2000, but did not then put it to good use. where the couple met many artists. In 1974, in Paris, the Christiane Colin gallery presents Renzi with a solo exhibition. A text by Jacques H√©rold about Renzi's work enriches the invitation, and a review by Jean Bouret appears in Les Nouvelles litt√©raires. Starting in 1976, the couple Kantu≈°er Renzi is housed in an annex of the Cit√© of Art, on the quays of the Seine, in the B.I.M.C. residence. Renzi has an atelier there, though smaller than in the past. In 1979, she organized a solo exhibition of her works at the BIMC gallery and also received the Art Directors Club Merit Award. The same year, she participated in a group exhibition at the Koryo gallery in Paris, notably in the company of Ung No Lee. During the decade, she exhibited in more than twenty salons and group exhibitions in the United States and Europe. In 1980, the Koryo gallery presented Renzi's recent paintings. The artist co-organized exhibitions at the BIMC gallery,Among the exhibitors at the BIMC gallery, note Riccardo Licata, Nicola Sene, Giuseppe Zigaina. The 1981 group exhibition included Lee Chesney, Pranas Gailius, Herbert Gentry, Hans Hartung, Jacques H√©rold, Wifredo Lam, Ung No Lee, Andr√© Masson, Jean Pons, Grace Renzi and Mary Anne Rose. and also exhibited her own work. During the 1980s, Renzi had ten solo exhibitions, two of which dedicated to her prints, in Kamnik, Ljubljana, Nantes, Paris, Salzburg and Venice. Besides painting, throughout the 1980s, Renzi devoted much of her time to printmaking, then mostly working in the Cit√© des Arts printmaking workshop. She exhibited regularly in painting and printmaking salons, and participated in many group exhibitions in Denmark, England, France in Nantes, Paris and Perpignan, Germany, Japan, Spain, the United States and Yugoslavia in Slovenia. Renzi stopped teaching in 1982, and the couple traveled extensively, often visiting Venice, Slovenia and Croatia, but also Vienna. In 1982, a solo exhibition was held at the gallery Veronika in Kamnik. Thanks to the BIMC, Renzi also had an atelier in Kamnik, but did not use it much. She presented her works in Venice with two solo exhibitions hosted by critic Enzo Di Martino, at the Segno Grafico center in 1981 and at the gallery Il Traghetto in 1984. In 1984, her grandson Nicolas was born in Berlin. In 1986, after the death of Malik Oussekine, Renzi began a series of works dedicated to this tragedy, on canvas and paper. On the other hand, she was awarded three art prizes: in 1987, the Prix Michel de Ghelderode, and in 1988, the Prijs voor Marineschilderen in Antwerp and the Prize \\"Do Forni\\" in'Venice. Renzi took part in the Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts in 1987 (she participated regularly until 1995). In 1988, a solo exhibition of paintings by Renzi was held at the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana. Towards the end of the decade, in addition to a trip to New York in 1989, Renzi continued to travel in Europe, including an artistic, tourist trip throughout Yugoslavia with Kantu≈°er and the Hoffschir couple.Madeleine Hoffschir, art historian and friend of Renzi, wrote a text appearing in a catalog of the artist. In 1990, Renzi was pleased to be awarded the title of Bailli de Lalande-de-Pomerol. By the early 1990s, Renzi was a member of the printmaking atelier Bo Halbirk in Paris, and her works were part of the workshop's exhibitions. She also continued to participate in exhibitions of the Cit√© des Arts printmaking workshop. Also in 1990, Renzi was interviewed for academic purposes by Aulikki Erom√§ki and Ingrid Wagner, whereupon the artist had the opportunity to give a lecture at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1991, as part of her participation in the exhibition \\"Im Unterschied\\" at the NGBK. Renzi had turned to acrylics in her work on canvas during the 1980s, but then switched back to oil, now treating the layers differently. During the 1990s, she had five solo exhibitions, in Cuxhaven, Fresnes and Paris, and her work was included in permanent collections in Cuxhaven, Guangzhou, Maastricht, New York and Sarcelles. During this decade, Renzi's work appears in more than thirty-five group exhibitions or salons, in Berlin, Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne, Fredrikstad, Grenoble, La Villedieu, Ljubljana, Maastricht, Nantes, New York, Paris, Sarcelles and Ville-d'Avray. Renzi participated in several books, etchings of hers being for instance part of \\"√âpaves\\" (driftwood) by Daniel des Brosses, poems that also inspired Kantu≈°er. The Kantuser couple often visited the United States during the decade, staying in New York with their friend Betty Statler (12th Street). In 1997, the couple was received in Oxford by Godfrey Howard (Oxon) and Fran√ßoise Legrand. That year she exhibited at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery. In 1999, Mary Anne Rose made an interview with Renzi for academic purposes. Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er died suddenly in May 1999. Renzi stopped painting after the death of her husband. She lived alone for the next ten years. Thanks to her, and through the Embassy of the United States in Paris, the manuscript scores of Kantu≈°er are preserved at the Library of Congress.Renzi also initiated the succession of the B.I.M.C., and thanks to her efforts, the B.I.M.C. collection of music scores is now at the M√©diath√®que Hector Berlioz at the Conservatoire de Paris. In 2000, she exhibited her works in a solo exhibition in Gro≈ænjan, studio Porton, on the occasion of a tribute to Kantu≈°er. In 2001, she co-organized a group exhibition at the Hofstra University Museum in New York, including two of her own paintings. Renzi had an original engraving chiseled on Kantu≈°er's grave at the P√®re Lachaise cemetery. In 2002, she organized a retrospective of fifty years of her work at the BIMC gallery. Renzi appeared in the film \\"Voyage musical en Slov√©nie\\" (2004) by Fran√ßois Goetghebeur and in a film made in Paris by Chen Tan (2004‚Äì05). In 2004 and 2005, no longer having an atelier at her disposal, she sold all her paintings with the exception of recent works (1990s), at two auctions at the H√¥tel Drouot. She presented the series of works dedicated to Malik Oussekine at a solo exhibition in 2007, in Givors, where the works were sold at an auction for the benefit of painting workshops for children from disadvantaged neighborhoods. Here Renzi's work is deliberately figurative, expressionist, while overall, her work was generally considered abstract. During the decade, she went alone to visit museums in Spain, and also spent a summer in Denmark in 2007, in residence at the Kirsten Kjaers Museum. In 2008 and 2009, although then walking with difficulty, she enjoyed spending a day in Deauville or Giverny, taking the train. After her loss of autonomy in 2010, Renzi entered the nursing home Cousin de M√©ricourt in Cachan. Grace Renzi (Grace Kantuser) died June 4, 2011 in Cachan, at the age of 88 years.

He had originally recorded and released the album on his own label before Vanguard took notice and re-issued it. Included are traditional songs and some of Case's own personal favorites. Case suffered from depression after being released by Geffen, but was pleased with Vanguard. \\"Vanguard takes on artists they believe in and lets them do what they need to do,\\" says Case. \\"That‚Äôs what they did in the ‚Äô60s ‚Äî that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre famous for ‚Äî and they‚Äôre living up to that legacy.

In the 16th century it was refaced, and after a fire in 1810 it was rebuilt with a slightly modified layout with the back of the house now used as the front entrance. Originally a sub manor of the Este family, the building form comprised a central open hall with cross- wings at either end. There are no traces of the original moat in the area, with the modern surroundings currently developed as factories and works, known as Hay Hall Business Park. It was listed Grade II in 1952.* History A moated house or manor was first founded at the site in about 1260 by the De La Haye family. Hay Hall passed on to the Este family in 1423, when the heiress Marian De La Haye married Thomas Este. They are commemorated in St. Edburgha's Church at Yardley by a wall sculpture depicting them. The Este family owned and occupied Hay Hall until the late seventeenth century, after which the property changed hands frequently. In 1917, the Patented Butted Tube Company purchased Hay Hall and a surrounding 13 acres of land. The estate was developed into new tube works and factories but Hay Hall was saved from demolition. The last person to actually reside at Hay Hall was apparently a Mrs Shelley who was employed as a housekeeper by the then rebranded Tube Investments Company, and was known to be living in the Hall up until 1939. In 1948 the building was fully restored and is currently in use as private offices for the Reynolds Tube Company Limited. Description The central part of the house features an arch-braced collar-beam roof truss, typical of an open hall of the 14th or 15th century. Notable external features include exposed timber-framing on the south-eastern end wall, and a two-storied timbered porch containing a pointed arch. On the northeastern side of the building a solar wing was either originally encased in diaper-patterned brickwork, or the wing was a later addition in the 16th century. Its structure is formed in three bays divided by open roof trusses, and which were later enclosed in a dormered attic. It also features stone-mullioned windows. Inside the building Tudor wall painting and a fragment of stained glass have survived. After the fire in 1810 it was subsequently rebuilt and partly altered with the addition of a new five-gabled front to the southwestern side. The building was further refurbished and altered in 1948.Secular Architecture, A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 7: The City of Birmingham (1964), pp. 43-57.

The green Patera aliens at the top of the screen are spawning the blue Quazars and the green Ejnar. The player is controlling the yellow spaceship. The game is set in the 25th century, in the fictional Magellanic galaxy. The player takes the role of a pilot of the Galaforce, an elite unit of the United Cosmological Federation, on a mission to conquer and overthrow hordes of \\"savage\\" aliens.Galaforce at Acorn Electron World Galaforce is inspired by arcade fixed shooter games, particularly the Galaga series, but is not a specific clone. The player controls a spaceship that can move horizontally and vertically in the bottom part of the screen (as in Galaga 3). The ship comes under attack from successive formations of aliens. The object of the game is to survive while scoring as highly as possible. Unlike many similar games, not all aliens need to be destroyed. Most of the formations involve aliens entering from one side of the screen, moving quickly across the screen in a set pattern, then leaving the screen or disintegrating at the edge. This most resembles a \\"Challenging Stage\\" in Galaga as unlike the standard Galaga stages, the aliens do not settle into a Galaxian style swarm. There are thirteen different aliens, requiring between one and ten hits to be destroyed, and a large number of different formations. The game is broken up into zones that include a series of formations. The aliens in Zone 1 do not fire at the player and never fly into the bottom area of the screen so as long as the player does not move upwards, it is not possible to be killed. The zones get progressively more difficult, with aliens entering or leaving the screen at the bottom (from Zone 2), firing at the player (from Zone 4) and firing homing bombs (from Zone 14). Some formations are known as multiplier formations where a small number of one type of alien keep spawning other aliens until the originals are destroyed.

A tropical disturbance formed in the middle of July 1991 in the eastern portion of the Western Pacific monsoon trough, and while tracking to the west-northwest, was designated a tropical depression on July 21\\\\. Thunderstorm activity associated with the depression increased markedly on July 22, and two days later, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Caitlin. The storm turned northward as it rounded a subtropical ridge while gradually intensifying. Caitlin became a typhoon on July 25 and peaked in intensity on July 27 near Okinawa. The typhoon began to weaken as it turned northeast over the Korea Strait. On July 30, Catlin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered the Sea of Japan. Across the Philippines, heavy rains triggered mudslides that claimed 16 lives and forced over 20,000 others to be evacuated. Due to the storm, reservoir levels in Okinawa on the island rose from only 35% to over 80% of its capacity and crop damage amounted to $7.4 million USD. On Kagoshima Prefecture, 72 homes were damaged and five million people were left without power. Twenty-three people suffered injuries in Nagasaki Prefecture while 116 ships were damaged offshore. On the Goto Islands, 32 people were rendered homeless. Throughout Japan, six fatalities were reported and thirty-nine others sustained injuries. A total of 64 houses were destroyed while 1,472 others were flooded. Moreover, 120 ships and 263 ha (650 acres) of farmland were destroyed. Damages totaled ¬•10.1 billion ($75 million USD). In South Korea, two people were killed and another two were listed as missing. Heavy rains caused flooding across residential areas and destroyed farmland. Around 30 ships were destroyed or damaged. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $6.3 million USD. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Caitlin can be traced back to a disturbance that formed in the middle of July in the eastern portion of the Western Pacific monsoon trough that extended south of Pohnpei in the eastern Caroline Islands. The disturbance moved west-northwestward, and although the low level center was initially displaced to the west of the deep convection, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system at 06:00 UTC on July 20. On the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system a tropical depression. Wind shear began to diminish on July 22, coinciding with falling pressures at Yap and increased convective activity. At 05:00 UTC on July 23, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the JTWC, and eight hours later, the JTWC declared the system Tropical Depression 09W. On July 24, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started watching the storm and assigned it the local name Ising. A rapid increase in convection prompted both the JTWC and JMA to upgrade the depression into Tropical Storm Caitlin the same day. Tropical Storm Caitlin tracked west- northwestward until July 24, when a semi-permanent subtropical ridge weakened near 130¬∞E, which caused the tropical storm to make a sharp northward turn; this turn was forecast well in advance by the Navy Operational Global Prediction System. Caitlin slowly intensified, and on the evening of July 24, the JMA classified Caitlin as a severe tropical storm. Satellite imagery depicted a cloud-filled eye, and midday on July 25, the JTWC upgraded Caitlin into a typhoon, with the JMA following suit that evening. At the time of the upgrade, Typhoon Caitlin was located around south of Okinawa. Continuing to intensify, Caitlin turned to the north-northwest. The typhoon passed west of Kadena Air Base at 15:32 UTC on July 27\\\\. Less than three hours later, the JTWC reported that Caitlin attained its peak intensity of . Meanwhile, the JMA estimated a peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . After passing Okinawa, the typhoon tracked north-northeastward around the periphery of a broad subtropical ridge. On July 29, Caitlin, while weakening, accelerated towards the northeast through the Korea Strait, and gradually transitioned into a typhoon force extratropical low as it moved into the Sea of Japan. The JTWC issued its final warning was issued early on July 30 when satellite imagery indicated the system had lost most of its tropical characteristics. Six hours later, the JMA also declared Caitlin extratropical. Impact Philippines The typhoon enhanced the monsoon across the northern Philippines, and caused rainfall to areas already deluged by prior floods. Manila received 210 mm (8.38 in) of rain on July 26; the rain triggered mudslides in the valleys near Mount Pinatubo while widespread flooding resulted in 16 deaths and the evacuation of more than 20,000 people. Japan The typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago, as far south as Okinawa and as far north as Ch≈´bu region. A peak rainfall total occurred of at Mount Akita-Komagatake. A peak hourly rainfall total of was observed in Yusuhara. Meanwhile, a peak daily precipitation total of fell in Naha. Nearby, Kadena Air Base recorded a total of 320 mm (12.51 in) of rain during a four day period, which was its heaviest precipitation record there since 1987. A wind gust of was recorded on Tokashiki Island. Nationwide, six fatalities were reported and thirty-nine others sustained injuries. A total 64 houses were destroyed while 1,472 others were flooded. Moreover, 120 ships were damaged. Monetary damage totaled ¬•10.1 billion ($75 million USD). Caitlin provided welcome relief to the drought-stricken island of Okinawa, which caused the reservoir levels on the island to rise from only 35% to over 80% of its capacity. Islandwide, one death and eight injuries were attributed to Caitlin. Crop damage was estimated at $7.4 million while U.S. military damage exceeded $1.2 million. On Shikoku Island, damage in K≈çchi Prefecture was estimated at ¬•132 million. Seventy-two homes were damaged on Kyushu in Kagoshima Prefecture. Five million people in the prefecture lost power. Damage there totaled ¬•768 million. A 42-year old man from Hy≈´ga died due to a lightning strike. Seven homes were damaged in Kumamoto Prefecture. Damage to 22 fishing boats in the prefecture amounted for ¬•456 million. Twenty-three people were wounded in Nagasaki Prefecture, including one who suffered a spinal cord injury due to strong winds. A total of 116 ships were damaged. Along the Goto Islands, many homes were destroyed, resulting in 32 homeless. Damage through the prefecture amounted to ¬•3.86 billion. A wall collapsed in Oita Prefecture, killing one person. In separate incidents, three people were wounded. In Saga Prefecture, three hundred and twenty-six homes were damaged and three other were destroyed while three individuals were hurt. One person perished and two others were injured in Fukuoka Prefecture. Six homes were also damaged. Monetary damage estimates exceeded ¬•294 million. On Honshu, two fatalities were reported in Kyoto Prefecture due to strong winds. Storm surge also damaged 47 dwellings. Elsewhere, 36 flights at the Kobe Airport were cancelled. A total of of arable land was damaged in Tottori prefecture. Eighteen homes were damaged in eastern Shimane prefecture. There, damage was estimated at ¬•146 million. Five homes were damaged or destroyed and seventy other lost power in Fukui Prefecture. Across southern portions of Nagano Prefecture, 20 cars were stranded in floodwaters. South Korea Prior to affecting South Korea, typhoon warnings were posted for the entire country. The U.S. military television network on South Korea went overtime to broadcast warnings. In advance of the storm, flights in and out of Cheju were cancelled. In all, two people were killed and another two were reported missing. Torrential rains caused flooding in residential areas and destroyed farmland. About 30 ships were destroyed or damaged. Five roads, a long railway, and a bridge were also damaged.

It was formed after it became apparent that it would be a number of years before the Eastern Counties Railway would extend their railway into Norfolk. Its Act of Parliament of 18 June 1842 authorised the issue of ¬£200,000 worth of shares to build a line between the two towns in its name, via Reedham and the Yare valley. The act laid out fees for the carriage of coal (which would arrive at Yarmouth by sea), bricks, iron,stone,fish and cotton as well as passengers. People The Chairman was George Stephenson and the Chief Engineer was his son Robert assisted by George Parker Bidder whilst the main contractor was Morton Peto. Shareholders included Sir Edmund Henry Knowles Lacon, John Edward Lacon (banker), Charles John Palmer (solicitor) and William Hurry Palmer (shipbuilder). Opening Robert Stephenson calculated the line would take around 18 months to build at a cost of ¬£7,000 per mile. Construction started in April 1843 by contractors Grissel and Peto and the 20.5 miles were completed in a year although the cost was ¬£10,000 per mile rather than the forecast ¬£7,000. An inspection/inaugural run on 12 April 1844 and a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1844, where a train ran from Norwich to Great Yarmouth carrying 200 guests and a brass band followed by \\"an elegant collation\\" followed by a return journey of 44 minutes and more lavish festivities in the evening. Operation Regular passenger operation began on 1 May 1844 with a passenger service of seven trains each way. As well as the station at Norwich, which was located next to the existing Norwich station and later served as a goods depot, there were five intermediate stations on the line at: * Brundall * Buckenham * Cantley * Reedham * Berney Arms The terminus at Great Yarmouth later became Yarmouth Vauxhall railway station. The Y&NR; acquired five locomotives and 15 carriages to operate the service. The Y&NR; was the first railway in the UK to install block signaling making use of the Cooke & Wheatstone Electric telegraph for this purpose. Members of the public were also allowed to use the system to send messages which the company would then deliver to the recipient. Merger The Y&NR; was merged with the Norwich & Brandon Railway on 30 June 1845, just prior to the opening of the latter, to form the Norfolk Railway, itself a founding constituent of the Great Eastern Railway amalgamation in 1862. The route is now part of the Wherry Lines.

It is commonly called hairy wood-mint or hairy pagoda plant.  Description  Hairy wood mint is a perennial plant that is normally tall. The central stem is covered with long white hairs and ends in several whorls of flowers. The flowers can be either light blue, pale purple or white with purple spots. Each flower is about long with light green sepals, two main 'lips', two visible stamens, and a style that is divided at its tip. The flowers appear in the summer for roughly a month and a half. Arranged oppositely along the stem, the leaves of hairy wood mint are long but thin, becoming wider near the base of the leaf. They are pleasantly fragrant. The petioles are and are covered with little hairs. Out of all the plants in this genus, Blephilia hirsuta has the largest leaves. The stems grow from a system of rhizomes with fibrous roots. Taxonomy The German-American botanist Frederick Pursh described the hairy wood mint as Monarda hirsuta in his 1814 work Flora americae septentrionalis, before George Bentham gave it its current binomial name. The species name hirsuta is Latin for \\"hairy\\".  Distribution and habitat  In Canada, hairy wood mint can be found in southern Quebec and Ontario. It is common throughout the eastern United States, including Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Hairy wood mint prefers rich moist soil in hardwood forests, along streams and rivers, in forest openings and thickets underlain by limestone, and is occasionally found near wetlands. Hairy wood mint likes partial sun or light shade. Forests with infrequent, low-intensity disturbances (i.e., gap dynamics) are ideal.  Importance to humans  Hairy wood mint is not generally used as food by humans, but it is often planted in gardens for its beauty and pleasant aroma; when the leaves are crushed or damaged they give off a minty scent. It may, however, have some beneficial medicinal properties, given that a related species (Blephilia ciliata) was used by the Cherokee as a poultice to treat headaches.  Ecology  Many different types of bees (e.g., honeybees, mason bees, and miner bees), flies (e.g., bee-flies and syrphids), and butterflies (e.g., skippers) pollinate the flowers of hairy wood mint. Many of these pollinators pollinate the hairy wood mint because they get a nectar reward, although some are after the pollen itself. The foliage \\"probably isn't attractive to mammalian herbivores as a food source.\\"  Conservation  Over most of its range Blephilia hirsuta is a secure species, but in Connecticut it is listed as a species of 'special concern', in Vermont it is 'threatened', and in Massachusetts Hairy wood mint is an endangered species. Unfortunately, the exact needs for conservation management are not known.

He served as a commander of several large prisoner camps set up to build railways and canals in northern parts of Russia. Unlike many of his peers, he avoided harsh treatment of the inmates. Life and career Barabanov was born into a family of a wealthy peasant. After the revolution he became Komsomol activist, since June 1919 led the culture and propaganda center in Altufyevo, in August 1920 served in the Red Army. During December 1920 ‚Äì 1924 he studied at the Military Academy in Petrograd. In 1922 he joined the Communist Party. After a short period of service in the Army, Barabanov was ordered to join OGPU (secret service) and through several positions climbed into a high-level post in the Moscow military district. In 1933 he moved into a senior position in the GULAG (labour camp) administration; in April 1933 he became deputy commander of Dmitlag, a camp set up in the city of Dmitrov in 1932 to dig the Moscow-Volga Canal. In April 1935 Barabanov was dismissed, expelled from the party (\\"for drinking and hiding he was son of a kulak\\") and spent six months in solitary confinement while being investigated. Eventually he was released and exiled to the North with his family. Here he headed labour camps, railway and military projects in Ukhta, Vorkuta, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Saratov and Pechora. In 1941 he was allowed to join the Party again, in 1944 promoted to lieutenant colonel, in 1946 to colonel. After World War II he was named to several top positions in the labour camps administration. For achievements during construction of the Volga-Don Canal Barabanov was in 1952 awarded title Hero of Socialist Labor, decorated by the Order of Lenin and the \\"Hammer and Sickle\\" gold medal and was further promoted. In June 1956 he retired, settled in Moscow and wrote for the Izvestia newspaper. According to numerous testimonies of former prisoners and employees of MVD alike, Barabanov differed sharply from the majority of the camp commanders. Unlike them, he was trying to improve living conditions of the inmates and motivated them to boost their work performance. A number of former prisoners did attend his funeral. Barabanov served as a model for the character of Batmanov, a competent organizer and Stalinist hero in the 1948 novel Far from Moscow by Vasily Azhayev.Anton√≠n Jaroslav Liehm, Mira Liehm: The most important art: Eastern European film after 1945, University of California Press, 1981, , page 65.

It was formed in 1845 by the amalgamation of the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway opened in 1844, and the Norwich and Brandon Railway, not yet opened. These lines were built out of frustration that the Eastern Counties Railway line that was expected to connect Norwich to London failed to be completed. The Norfolk Railway also leased the Lowestoft Railway and Harbour company, and built a branch to Dereham and Fakenham, opened in 1846 and 1849 respectively. It was successful in connecting Norwich to the emerging railway network, by connecting at Brandon with a line from London via Cambridge and also a line from the Midlands through Peterborough. However as a local line it was dependent on bigger partners, and it was threatened by new competing lines, so that its independence was always at risk. In 1848 it agreed with the larger Eastern Counties Railway that the ECR would operate its line, reducing the Norfolk Railway to a financial company only. In 1862 it amalgamated with other companies to form the Great Eastern Railway. Its first lines, from Great Yarmouth to Norwich and Norwich to Brandon, continue in use at the present day as important regional routes, and although the Dereham and Fakenham branch closed to passengers in the 1960s, the majority of this line remains open as the Mid-Norfolk Railway. Yarmouth and Norwich Railway The merchants of Norwich had been gratified when the Eastern Counties Railway got its authorising Act in 1836 to build a line from London to their city and on to Great Yarmouth. The capital for the construction was ¬£1.6 million,George Dow, The First Railway in Norfolk, published by the London and North Eastern Railway, second edition, 1947 a huge amount at the time. The Eastern Counties Railway had grossly underestimated the cost of building its line, and it was running out of money. The people of Norwich were dismayed in April 1839, when the ECR announced that it would be unable to build any further than Colchester for the time being.John Barney, The Norfolk Railway: Railway Mania in East Anglia, Mintaka Books, Norwich, 2007, D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, Cecil J Allen, The Great Eastern Railway, Ian Allan, Shepperton, fifth edition 1968Hugh Moffat, East Anglia's first railways, Terence Dalton Limited, Lavenham, 1987, Yarmouth railway station in the 1980sThroughout the remainder of that year and in 1840, a number of schemes were put forward and discussed; there were alternative routes, but they all met with the suspicion that large sums of money might be subscribed without the lines being completed. By now the Northern and Eastern Railway was in financial difficulty too; its original intention of connecting London to York was eventually reduced to a line from Stratford to Newport, Essex. Ambitious railway schemes in East Anglia were not held in high esteem, especially when their projected cost was quoted in millions of pounds. Norwich Thorpe station in 1911On 21 January 1841, a meeting was held in Norwich to determine how to improve the transport links of Norwich. As a first step, a link to Yarmouth was planned. Yarmouth was the port for the City of Norwich, and at the same time a fashionable watering place, and would be useful, as coastwise shipping was an important transport medium for heavy materials, particularly coal, and the railway would enable minerals to be brought to Norwich from the harbour at Yarmouth. The ECR powers to build between Norwich and Yarmouth had lapsed by this time, but at a meeting on 19 March 1841 a proposal was tabled, prepared by Robert Stephenson, for a line. It was to be routed indirectly, via Reedham, to minimise the cost by avoiding certain river crossings and keeping to low- lying ground: it became known as the Valley Line. It would cost a little under ¬£200,000 including land acquisition and rolling stock. The project went to the 1842 session of Parliament, and in the face of Eastern Counties Railway opposition, the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway Act passed on 18 June 1842. George Stephenson was the chairman of the Company and Robert Stephenson the engineer. Share capital was ¬£150,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Grissell and Peto were appointed as the contractors; they had agreed to take ¬£30,000 of their fee in shares; they started work in late March 1843. There proved to be a difficulty over the Yarmouth terminus, which was planned to be on an island owned by Robert Cory. The only access was over a primitive and narrow suspension toll bridge, and there were covenants preventing anyone from building a further access bridge. The issue was not resolved by the time the line opened, and at first arriving passengers were ferried across the River Bure. Cory objected to that, stating that he had the monopoly on ferry crossings as well, and the matter went to court. Somerleyton stationOn 12 April 1844 the line was nearly complete and a special train was run over the line, conveying, among others, General Pasley of the Board of Trade. There was a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1844, followed by the full public opening on 1 May 1844. There were seven passenger trains each way daily, four of which were non-stop trains completing the journey in 45 minutes; there were five intermediate stations. The Yarmouth terminus later became known as Yarmouth Vauxhall. For some time at the beginning, there were no goods or mineral trains; in fact this service was delayed until the Brandon connection was finished. The company contracted out the operation of its trains to George Merrett, Peto's agent during the construction, for ¬£7,000 a year. The Yarmouth and Norwich Railway was the first in the country to adopt electric telegraph block working from its beginning. Neele described the signalling arrangements: > The stations intermediate between Reedham and Norwich were very primitive > and small; the mode of signalling as simple as could well be devised. A > lofty pole at the station platform was furnished with a circular creel or > basket, painted red. If this was pulled to the top of the pole, the train > was to stop. Semaphores and distant signals were unknown on the Line, but > while this was the case with signals, the telegraphing of train progress was > in advance of any system in vogue at that time on any other line, or indeed > at the present day, for standing in the foreman's office at Norwich, it was > easy to observe the signals which indicated, by large deflected needles, the > passage of the going or coming train at Norwich, Brandon Junction, Brundall, > Reedham. and Yarmouth, respectively.George P Neele, Railway Reminiscences, > McCorquodale & Co., London, 1904 Carter states that \\"the Yarmouth and Norwich for many years held the railway 'sprint' record of one mile in 44 seconds.\\" Norwich and Brandon Railway Trowse old swing bridge during removal)Authorisation of the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway had gone through smoothly, and thoughts in Norwich turned to connecting the city to the emerging railway network. Much of the September 1843 shareholders' meeting of the Yarmouth and Norwich company was taken up with discussion of possible extensions. Samuel Morton Peto said that if they built a line to Brandon, 40 miles to the west, then the existing railways would compete to join it at Brandon, so completing a through connection to the other lines. The choice of Brandon must have been the result of private negotiations with some or all of the other railways that might join up there.Brandon is also just across the border from Norfolk into Suffolk. In September 1843 a notice appeared in the press making this objective plain: > Norwich and Brandon Railway: A prospectus has this week been issued for the > formation of a railway, in extension of the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway, > commencing near the terminus in this city [Norwich], and running to Brandon, > a distance of thirty miles... from Brandon, the country is... favourable for > the construction of lines to communicate with the branch of the London and > Birmingham Railway at Peterborough, with the Eastern Counties railway at > Colchester, and with the Northern and Eastern railway at Newport, the > distance in each case being the same, viz., about 40 miles. By the > construction of this railway, it is anticipated, Norwich, Yarmouth, and the > county of Norfolk, will be ultimately connected, not only with the > metropolis but with the Midland and Northern counties, and the manufacturing > districts, as, no doubt, extension lines, to connect it with the above- > mentioned railways, would speedily be obtained by the respective companies, > who have already expressed their desire to co-operate with the promoters of > the undertaking; and, with tbat object, some of them are now actually > employed in making surveys.Norfolk Chronicle, 23 September 1843 Trowse swing bridge, 1905)An 8% return would, it was claimed, be achieved on the present volume of traffic, but a \\"great increase of income\\" would be secured \\"on the ultimate completion of a line to Peterborough, or to Colchester, or Newport\\" by attracting traffic from coastal shipping. The capital to be raised was ¬£300,000. The London and Birmingham Railway was not induced to extend its Peterborough branch to Brandon, and the Eastern Counties Railway had stalled at Colchester. Nevertheless the Northern and Eastern Railway had got as far as Bishops Stortford and an extension of that to Brandon by way of Cambridge and Ely was feasible. Accordingly the Norwich and Brandon Railway went ahead and it secured its authorising Act of Parliament on 10 May 1844. Eastern Counties Railway to Brandon A train crossing Reedham swing BridgeThe Eastern Counties Railway had been authorised on 4 July 1836 to construct a railway from London to Great Yarmouth by way of Ipswich and Norwich. At the time of authorisation this was a huge scheme: 126 miles of railway at a cost of ¬£1.6 million, and it turned out that the project was considerably underestimated. The ECR only reached Colchester, and ran out of money, and for the time being the project finished there. The Northern and Eastern Railway had built a line from London to Bishop's Stortford, using the ECR London terminus. It had originally intended to build a line from London to York by way of Cambridge, but that too proved to be unachievable, and its authorised route was cut back to reaching from London to Newport, Essex. The ECR worked the trains on the N&ER;, which was also seriously short of money. On 1 January 1844 the Eastern Counties Railway secured a 999-year lease of the N&ER.; The N&ER; had only reached Bishop's Stortford, but at the time of the lease it was in the course of constructing on to its authorised northern extremity at Newport, a distance of about 9 miles. When the Norwich and Brandon Railway was being promoted, the ECR saw that a continuation from Newport to Brandon would not only include the important regional centre of Cambridge, but give it a through route to Norwich via Ely. This was a more attractive proposition than trying to revive the Colchester to Norwich route, so the ECR went to Parliament for the necessary powers to build to Brandon, to meet the Norwich and Brandon Railway there; it got the Royal Assent for the project on 4 July 1844.Gordon, page 105; Allen says 4 June 1844, page 13. Cory's bridge at Yarmouth The Yarmouth suspension bridge owned by Cory was the only fixed access from the railway station to the town, crossing the Bure, and the railway company had been unable to secure powers to by-pass it. On 2 May 1845 the bridge collapsed under a crowd of people, and more than a hundred drowned: > The scene of this dreadful event was the Suspension-bridge, on the North > Quay, crossing the river Bure, and which has been the entrance to the town > from the railway and the new road from Acle. Cooke's Equestrian Company has > for some time been staying in the town, and on the morning of this fatal day > it was announced by public handbills that Nelson, one of the clowns, would > sail up the River Bure... in a common washing tub, drawn by four \\"real > geese,\\" elegantly harnessed and caparisoned... The clown and his geese > started from the Old Bridge in the presence of an immense concourse of > persons, who had assembled on the banks of the river to witness the feat. On > his arrival at the mouth of the Bure, a current took him towards Braydon > whence he was obliged to be towed back to the union of the two streams. The > multitude of persons along the North Quay was greatly increased by the rush > from the Old Bridge, and every spot where a view of Nelson and his geese > could be obtained, was filled with spectators. By far the most advantageous > view was had from the Suspension-bridge, and... about four hundred persons > occupied this position... every point of vision towards the spot where the > geese were to be looked for was densely crammed with men, women, and > children, and even the chains and suspenders had many occupants. This is the > bridge which has been the cause of so much litigation between the Yarmouth > Railway Company and Mr. Cory, its proprietor and which has, since the > arrangement with the parties, become the principal, if not the only medium > of transit to and from the railway terminus. In order to accommodate this > increased traffic, the proprietors had been induced to extend the bridge on > each side of the chains, to the extent of four feet, for foot passengers, > and the platform on the south side was the chief receptacle for the > multitude who were on the bridge on this occasion... all eyes were stretched > to the utmost and every ear listening with eagerness for the first > announcement of the clown's appearance. This anxiety was brought to its > highest pitch by the cry of \\"Here come the geese.\\" The shout resounded from > side to side; but amidst was a shriek from the shores; the bridge was > observed to give way; it lowered on one side; the chains snapped asunder, > one after another in momentary succession, and almost before the gaze of the > thronging multitude could be drawn from its object of worthless interest it > was riveted to the half sunken bridge--suspended on one side by its unbroken > chains‚Äî-cleared of all its occupants‚Äî-every one of whom were plunged into > the stream, and over them the waters were flowing as if unconscious of the > fearful tragedy which had momentarily occurred.Article from the Norwich > News, reprinted in the Bradford Observer, 8 May 1845 In February 1847 the Board agreed to pay Cory ¬£26,000 to buy him out. A railway-owned bridge was to be provided as well as a replacement for his own bridge, and tolls would be charged to persons taking the Acle Road and not proceeding to or from the railway station. Formation of the Norfolk Railway The directors of the Norwich and Brandon Railway and those of the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway saw that their companies had shared interests, and an amalgamation was proposed. This was agreed to, and a combined company, known as the Norfolk Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 30 June 1845. The Norfolk Railway had a route mileage of 58. Opening from Bishop's Stortford to Norwich Berney Arms stationThe line from Bishop's Stortford to Norwich was opened ceremonially on 29 July 1845. It consisted of the final section of the N&ER; between Bishop's Stortford and Newport (constructed by the N&ER; but immediately adopted by the ECR), the ECR from Newport to Brandon, and the Norfolk Railway from Brandon to Trowse, all opened on the same day. Ordinary public traffic over the route began on 30 July 1845. The Trowse station was just outside Norwich: the final entry to the city was delayed while a swing bridge over the River Wensum at Carrow was completed.The Carrow swing bridge is nowadays generally referred to as Trowse Swing Bridge. Thus the first railway communication between London (Shoreditch) and Norwich (Trowse) had been brought to completion, though by way of Cambridge, and not the Colchester route for which the Eastern Counties had obtained its original powers in 1836. For eight months from the opening, the Norfolk Railway worked the train service to and from Ely, as the Eastern Counties Railway was unable, as yet, to service this section. The company found itself short of locomotives to work its network, and twenty additional engines were ordered. The Carrow (or Trowse) swing bridge was later completed on 15 December 1845 and the line fully opened into Thorpe Junction, where it met the Yarmouth and Norwich line and gained access to the Norwich station (named Norwich Thorpe from the date of the opening of Victoria station on 12 December 1849). The swing bridge was over a hundred feet long, with two equal opening spans of 44 feet, although only one was navigable. The best time for the journey from Norwich to London was four hours. The Norwich and Brandon Railway originally intended to serve Thetford by a branch, but during construction it became obvious that Thetford ought to be on the main line and the line of route was modified. In doing so, it took a marked southward sweep to run through the town. Lowestoft Railway and Harbour Samuel Morton Peto purchased the Somerleyton Estate, near Lowestoft, in 1844 and on 28 September 1844 he promoted a public meeting at which he urged the construction of a railway from Lowestoft to Reedham, where it would have a triangular junction to join the Yarmouth and Norwich line. The harbour at Lowestoft, much used for its fishing fleet, was falling into disrepair, and something would need to be done to improve that too. The meeting agreed that a railway would be a good thing, and a Bill for the line was deposited for the 1845 session of Parliament. Peto personally acquired the harbour at Lowestofat Opposition from Yarmouth was confined to technical and drainage issues, and the Bill was passed on 30 June 1845; share capital was to be ¬£120,000, of which ¬£80,000 was for building an eleven mile railway and ¬£40,000 was for harbour improvements at Lowestoft itself. Two swing bridges would be required on the line. The cost of completing the harbour works alone was later estimated at ¬£174,516. The line opened on 3 May 1847 to goods and 1 July 1847 to passenger traffic. However before this opening, the company's line was leased by the Norfolk Railway, in 1846. The lease gave the Norfolk Railway control of the Lowestoft company in perpetuity, for 4% on the Lowestoft capital of ¬£120,000, dividing any additional profit between them.Railway Times, volume 10, 1847 Dereham and Fakenham branch Wymondham stationDuring 1845 a furious and controversial series of discussions took place in Norwich about a railway to Dereham and Fakenham, and the route it should take. A branch from Wymondham to Dereham was already authorised, and after considerable argument, it was proceeded with. It opened from Wymondham to Dereham on 7 December 1846 for goods trains and on 15 February 1847 for passengers. The powers naturally passed to the Norfolk Railway. The following year, during construction, the Norfolk Railway sought an Act to extend the Dereham line to Wells and Blakeney; this was granted by an Act of 1846. The Wells and Blakeney extensions were not built, and the new work was confined to building to Fakenham only. The construction contract was let to Peto in the Spring of 1847. Norfolk Railway worked by the Eastern Counties Railway When the Eastern Counties Railway failed to construct on from Colchester to Norwich, a new company stepped in, named the Eastern Union Railway. Together with an allied company, the Ipswich and Bury Railway, it completed the line from Colchester through Ipswich to its own terminus at Norwich; the through route was opened to traffic in 1849. During 1846 and 1847, the EUR negotiated to acquire the Norfolk Railway, but the two Companies were unable to agree terms. The Eastern Counties Railway now engaged in talks and was more successful. Agreement for acquisition of the Norfolk Railway was finalised on 2 May 1848, and the ECR took over the entire Norfolk Railway system, rolling stock included, on 8 May 1848. It sacked the Norfolk Railway staff and substituted its own. Gordon says that the ECR \\"took the Norfolk on lease, so saving it from financial 'perdition'\\".Gordon, page 164 This required the approval of Parliament, and the companies had agreed that if Parliament refused to sanction the takeover, then in May 1855, the Norfolk Railway should have the option of repurchasing its rolling stock at the same price as the ECR paid in 1848; in the meantime the stock should be properly maintained. In 1849 Parliament ratified the working arrangement, but refused the amalgamation, so that the ECR was working the line only; it did however purchase the rolling stock, a process that was completed by mid-summer 1850. The Norfolk Railway system consisted of 94 miles of railway; it had 40 locomotives, and it had cost ¬£2.3 million. Brandon stationAccordingly from May 1848 the Norfolk Railway ceased to operate trains on its lines, which became simply branches of the Eastern Counties Railway. However and amalgamation Bill failed in Parliament in the 1849 session. Although the Norfolk Railway now had only financial matters to concern it, these proved extremely troublesome due to haphazard financial control and accounting during its active lifetime. Formation of the Great Eastern Railway The Eastern Counties Railway now operated the Norfolk Railway, which reduced NR activity to simply being an owner of the line but not having any hand in its operation. The ECR gained similar control of other railways in East Anglia, and at length amalgamation was proposed. In 1862 the ECR, the Norfolk Railway, the Eastern Union Railway and the East Anglian Railway amalgamated, forming a new company, the Great Eastern Railway. This was ratified by act of Parliament of 7 August 1862, retrospectively effective from 1 July 1862. The GER owned two main lines between London and Norwich, and the Norwich to Yarmouth and Norwich to Lowestoft lines of the Norfolk Railway became branch lines of the GER; the same was true of the Dereham branch. Other developments The Acle line, forming a slightly shorter route between Yarmouth and Norwich, opened in 1883. In association with the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, the GER built the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway between Lowestoft and Yarmouth. This formed a much shorter route, opening in 1903, but the line failed to develop as had been hoped. It closed in 1970. Grouping and nationalisation In 1923 the Great Eastern Railway was made a constituent of a new company, the London and North Eastern Railway, as part of a process determined by the Railways Act 1921, commonly referred to as \\"the grouping of the railways\\". In 1948 the LNER and other companies were taken into national ownership as part of British Railways. Most of the network of the Norfolk Railway continues in use; the Brandon to Norwich line lost much of the London traffic, which was later concentrated on the Ipswich route. However it gained from a much more frequent cross-country passenger service from Liverpool via Ely and Thetford, typically at hourly intervals. The original Yarmouth and Norwich line was partly by-passed by a shorter route by way of Acle; its extremities still operate a good local passenger service and the original Reedham route from Yarmouth carries only a minimal train service. However the Lowestoft to Norwich trains run through Reedham. These train services are branded the Wherry Lines for marketing purposes. There is very limited freight activity on these routes. The Fakenham to Dereham route section closed to passenger traffic on 5 October 1964.Neil Burgess, Norfolk‚Äôs Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, Catrine, 2016, From Dereham to Wymondham followed, closing in October 1969, although the line remained open for goods traffic until the 1980s. The section from Wymondham to North Elmham was retained as a dormant railway for some years, leading to its survival as the Mid-Norfolk Railway.

Description Its shell is relatively small for the genus, around 11 mm in length, slender shaped, thick, solid and semi-fusiform, early four whorls elate, acuminate spire, well swollen periphery. The body whorl is half of the shell length, with a protoconch of about 1.5 whorls. The teleoconch consists of around 5 to 6 convex whorls with a tall spire. Narrow axial ribs reach from suture to suture. Distribution The species is only known from the type locality, which is situated between 180 and 250 m deep, near Mactan Island, Cebu, the Philippines. Habitat The species lives on sandy mud with small gravel. Etymology The word \\"latiaxisa\\" refers to the particular characteristics of trigonal spines, which reminds one of the genus Latiaxis in the subfamily Coralliophiliinae in the Muricidae.

TaylorIII (born January 13, 1957) is an American computer game designer, serial entrepreneur and massively multiplayer online game pioneer. He is a co-founder (with his University of Virginia classmate Kelton Flinn) of the game company Kesmai, which they founded in 1981. In 2011, Taylor was awarded the Online Game Legend Award by the Computer Game Developers Association. Game development and career history Early career In the late 1970s Taylor co-founded the Charlottesville, VA-based company Amber Electronics to design and build high end audio equipment for the consumer audiophile market. The business was sold and as of 2012, Amber Electronics operates in Australia. After Amber Electronics, Taylor spent five years at General Electric‚Äôs Industrial Electronics Development Lab, where he developed test systems for Computer Numerical Controls and motion control systems for advanced robotics. Founding of Kesmai In 1981, along with Dr. Kelton Flinn, Taylor founded Kesmai, the oldest US online multiplayer game company. The name Kesmai was generated from an auto-name generation program, while they were trying to name the island featured in Kesmai‚Äôs first online role playing game. In 1982, the company was incorporated and Taylor and Flinn decided to name the company Kesmai as well. Taylor and Dr. Flinn's efforts demonstrated the commercial viability of the online game industry. Taylor was instrumental in pioneering the design of text-based MUDs and role-playing games as well as the first multiplayer flight simulation game with a graphical interface - Air Warrior. He, along with Dr. Flinn also designed and developed a massively online gaming enabling technology called ARIES. Taylor expanded the business into the publishing of third party online games via distribution agreements with U.S., Japanese and European online providers. Kesmai‚Äôs major titles include: :* MegaWars III (1983) ‚Äî MegaWars III was the first game Kesmai published for CompuServe in 1983. Ironically, the reason they wanted to go to CompuServe was to have enough computation power to do Island of Kesmai, but it proved too computationally expensive. Consequently, MegaWars III was developed. MegaWars III, was an adaptation of a game called \\"S\\". Another irony: Not one of the MegaWars games are related to each other except by name; the original was based on the old university mainframe game DECWAR. :* Island of Kesmai (1985) ‚Äî The rewrite of Flinn and Taylor's old text action adventure game went live at the end of 1985 after a long internal test cycle. It cost $6 an hour at 300 baud (the slow dial-up modems of the day), $12 for 1200 baud (the fast dial-up modems). :* Stellar Warrior (1985) ‚Äî This rewrite of Mega Wars III introduced substantially simplified game play to expand its potential audience, and debuted on the GEnie online service the same day that Islands of Kesmai went live on CompuServe. :* Air Warrior (1986) ‚Äî This game, offered on GEnie, is a key milestone in the history of computer games because it was the first commercial multiplayer online game to add graphics, displaying a 3D airplane dogfight environment. The original game was developed for the Apple Macintosh, and was followed by Amiga and Atari ST versions; the IBM PC version debuted in 1987. In another major innovation, Kesmai combined Mac, Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC players all in the same game, flying against each other. :* Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA (1991) ‚Äî This title takes the Air Warrior concept to a futuristic land-based combat using heavily armed giant robots called Mechs. The game was very popular with players who fought for supremacy over the BattleTech universe. The game was technologically challenging for computers at the time due to the need for the computer to draw more terrain than it needed to draw when planes are flying in the air where much of the background is plain blue sky. News Corporation and Electronic Arts In 1994, Taylor negotiated the sale of Kesmai Corporation to Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs News Corporation. Taylor remained at News Corporation for six years and was instrumental in developing Kesmai‚Äôs GameStorm, a pay-for-play web based gaming service. News Corporation sold its online game business to Electronic Arts where Taylor was General Manager of EA Virginia and also Chief Production Officer for EA.com. Castle Hill Studios and Video Gaming Technologies, Inc.  In 2001, Taylor co-founded Castle Hill Studios in 2001, a game development and technology company. Castle Hill worked with Microsoft, Electronic Arts and others to develop online gaming concepts and designs based on top-rated television, movie and gaming properties. In 2003, Taylor joined Video Gaming Technologies, a Class II casino gaming company, as Vice President of Engineering. He returned to Castle Hill in 2010 and now develops and manages intellectual properties for gaming systems. Personal life Taylor graduated from the University of Virginia in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with Distinction and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Distinction. He received a master's in Computer Science from the university in 1985. In October 2011, Taylor was awarded the Online Game Legend Award by the Computer Game Developers Association. Taylor is active in his community and has been involved in the Boy Scouts of America since 1998. He was awarded the Silver Beaver Award by the Virginia Headwaters Council (formerly Stonewall Jackson Council).

History Wykeham Abbey was built on the side of the former Wykeham Priory, a Cistercian nunnery established between 1140-1160. Pain de Wykeham granted his house to the priory and his son Theobald gifted the nuns 48 acres of land. King Henry III granted them an additional 103 acres. The nunnery was destroyed by fire during the reign of Edward III (between 1312 and 1377) and rebuilt. It was dissolved in 1539 and the lands granted to Francis Poole in 1544. The only relic of the nunnery is the north wall of the priory church, which dates from the end of the 12th century. The present house was built in the mid-18th century for Richard Hutchinson, who assumed the surname Langley after he became heir to his uncle Thomas Langley. His grandson, also Richard Langley, died childless in 1817, and bequeathed his estates to his cousin Marmaduke Dawnay, the younger son of John Dawnay, 4th Viscount Downe. In 1824, Marmaduke also assumed the surname Langley. He died in 1851, unmarried, and Wykeham Abbey has remained in the Dawnay family since. The house was considerably expanded in the 19th century; 1835 is the year marked on a datestone and the loggia was added in 1839. There were further additions in 1904 enlarging the house. Wykeham Abbey has been the seat of the Viscounts Downe since 1909, and the surrounding estate spreads across 2,500 acres. Like many country houses in England, Wykeham Abbey served as a Red Cross recovery hospital in World War I. From 1914 to 1919, more than 1,520 non-commissioned officers and soldiers from across the British Isles passed through the doors. Listed buildings The main house is Grade II* listed.

It is used to treat B cell cancers like mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia. Medical uses Ibrutinib is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, and as a second- line treatment for mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and chronic graft vs host disease. In the United States ibrutinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy, adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with or without 17p deletion, adults with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM), adults with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti- CD20-based therapy, adults with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. It is a first line treatment in those with CLL who require treatment and are newly diagnosed. It may also be used in CLL that relapses. Resistance Both primary (inherent) and secondary (acquired) resistance has been reported in various lymphomas, including CLL and MCL. Resistance may arise due to mutations that impair the affinity of ibrutinib for BTK, or due to alterations in pathways downstream of BTK and may confer BCR signaling independence in resistant clones. Adverse effects Very common (>10% frequency) adverse effects include pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, skin infection, low neutrophil count, low platelet counts, headache, bleeding, bruising, diarrhea, vomiting, inflammation of mouth and lips, nausea, constipation, rash, joint pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, fever, and edema. Common (1‚Äì10% frequency) adverse effects include sepsis, urinary tract infection, non-melanoma skin cancer (basal-cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), low leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count, interstitial lung disease, tumor lysis syndrome, high uric acid levels, dizziness, blurred vision, atrial fibrillation, subdural hematoma, nosebleeds, small bruises from broken blood vessels, high blood pressure, hives, and skin redness or blushing. Pharmacology Ibrutinib oral bioavailability is 3.9% in a fasting state, 8.4% in a fed state, and 15.9% after consumption of grapefruit juice. Mechanism Ibrutinib has been reported to reduce chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell chemotaxis towards the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, and inhibit cellular adhesion following stimulation at the B-cell receptor (BCR). Additionally, ibrutinib down-modulates the expression of CD20 (target of rituximab/ofatumumab) by targeting the CXCR4/SDF1 axis. Together, these data are consistent with a mechanistic model whereby ibrutinib blocks BCR signaling, which drives cells into apoptosis and/or disrupts cell migration and adherence to protective tumour microenvironments. In preclinical studies on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, ibrutinib has been reported to promote apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and also prevent CLL cells from responding to survival stimuli provided by the microenvironment. This also leads to a reduction of MCL1 levels (anti-apoptotic protein) in malignant B cells. Treatment of activated CLL cells with ibrutinib resulted in inhibition of BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and also effectively abrogated downstream survival pathways activated by this kinase including ERK1/2, PI3K, and NF-Œ∫B. Additionally, ibrutinib inhibited proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, effectively blocking survival signals provided externally to CLL cells from the microenvironment including soluble factors (CD40L, BAFF, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-Œ±), fibronectin engagement and stromal cell contact. In early clinical studies, the activity of ibrutinib has been described to include a rapid reduction in lymphadenopathy accompanied by a transient lymphocytosis, suggesting that the drug might have direct effects on cell homing or migration to factors in tissue microenvironments. History Ibrutinib was created by scientists at Celera Genomics as a tool compound for studying BTK function; it covalently binds its target which is ideal for a reagent but generally not considered ideal for drugs. In 2006, in the course of acquiring an HDAC- focused program from Celera after its own initial discovery program had failed, Pharmacyclics also picked up Celera's small molecule BTK inhibitor discovery program for $2M in cash and $1M in stock and named the tool compound PCI-32765. In 2011 after the drug had completed Phase II trials, Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics agreed to co-develop the drug, and J&J; paid Pharmacyclics $150 million upfront and $825 million in milestones. Pharmacyclics was acquired by AbbVie in May 2015, and Abbvie projected global sales of US$1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 13, 2013, for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. On February 12, 2014, the FDA expanded the approved use of ibrutinib to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It was approved for Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia in 2015. In March 2015, Pharmacyclics and AbbVie agreed that Abbvie would acquire Pharmacyclics for $21 billion; the deal was completed that May. In March 2016, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In May 2016, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In January 2017, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. In August 2017, the FDA approved a new indication for ibrutinib to treat graft-versus-host disease. It was the first drug approved by the FDA for this condition. In February 2018, a tablet formulation of ibrutinib was approved for use in the United States. In August 2018, ibrutinib in combination with rituximab was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare and incurable type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In January 2019, ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab was approved for the treatment of adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). In April 2020, the FDA expanded the indication of ibrutinib to include its combination with rituximab for the initial treatment of adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Approval was based on the E1912 trial (NCT02048813), a 2:1 randomized, multicenter, open-label, actively controlled trial of ibrutinib with rituximab compared to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in 529 adult subjects 70 years or younger with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring systemic therapy. Cost The typical cost of ibrutinib in the United States is about $148,000 a year. Preliminary PK/PD focused research found that people could potentially be put on lower and less expensive regimen of ibrutinib without losing efficiency; however, no data showing efficiency of lower doses has been published. Janssen Pharmaceutica and Pharmacyclics introduced a new single dose tablet formulation with a flat pricing structure in the first half of 2018 and discontinue the capsule formulation. This caused an outcry as it was perceived to triple in the cost of the drug to the average patient. Patients receiving the FDA approved and recommended doses would have seen either no price change or a price decrease with the tablet pricing structure. Janssen Pharmaceutica and Pharmacyclics have since reversed the decision to discontinue the capsule formulation with the drug currently available in both capsule and tablet forms. Ibrutinib was added to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 2018. Generic ibrutinib was added to the Indian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 2020. Brand names In Bangladesh it is available under the brandname Ibrutix by Beacon Pharmaceuticals.

In contrast to earlier film magazines such as The Moving Picture World, which were aimed at film exhibitors, The Motion Picture Story Magazine was aimed at regular film goers. It has been regarded as the first fan magazine. The magazine was very successful from its inception, with an initial run of 50,000 copies and a circulation of 200,000 by 1914. Writers were amazed at the outset to receive their checks for contributions almost immediately on acceptance, a policy on the part of Brewster that was effective in quickly inducing the highest grade fiction authors to become affiliated with the publication. Contributors included Rex Beach, Will Carleton and Horatio C.

In 1927, he founded the League Against Pogroms, which the following year, became the International League Against Anti-Semitism, and in 1979, became the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism. He was the president from 1927 to 1968.  Life and career  Lecache, was born in Paris, France in 1895, the son of Jewish emigrants from Ukraine. He launched himself into journalism, contributing to La Volont√©, the Journal du Peuple, one of the first French Bolshevik publications, and at Le Quotidien. An activist with the Human Rights League, he was equally close to the socialist movement and the future founders of the French Communist Party (French: Parti communiste fran√ßais, PCF), such as Boris Souvarine. He frequented the home of anarchist journalist S√©verine and married her granddaughter, Denise Montrobert. Lecache applauded the 1917 Russian Revolution and was an early member of the PCF, joining in 1921. He became the editor of L'Humanit√© where he provided the anti-miliarist section. Obliged to choose between the Freemasons and the Party in 1923, like all the communists, Lecache, who was close to the Masons, refused to choose and was expelled from the PCF. His ideas and his friends did not change, however, and he chaired a meeting for the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in October 1927. The following year, he became a member of the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union. In May 1926, in the heart of Paris, the Jewish anarchist Sholom Schwartzbard killed Symon Petliura, a nationalist Ukrainian he accused of starting pogroms that devastated his family. Working as a contributor to Le Quotidien, Lecache became interested in the case and asked the socialist lawyer Henry Torr√®s if he could support the assassin's defense. He was sent to Ukraine to investigate by Henri Dumay.\\"Lecache in Kiew (Deutsche Zentral-Zeitung, 1926-09-22)\\" German National Library of Economics.

Retrieved December 9, 2011 Schwartzbard was acquitted on October 26, 1927. The following year, the League changed its name to the International League Against Anti-Semitism. Lecache was initiated into the Freemasons at the beginning of the 1930s. He was a member of the Grand Orient de France and founded the lodge Abb√© Gr√©goire, addressing the rise of Nazism and European anti-semitism. Lechache wrote in the newspaper \\"Droit de Vivre\\" (December 1938): 'It is our task to organize the moral and cultural blockade of Germany and disperse this nation. It is up to us to start a merciless war.' Lecache was president of the organization for forty years, until his death in 1968. He was replaced by Jean Pierre-Bloch, who remained president until 1993.

Many people tend to walk at about . Although many people are capable of walking at speeds upwards of , especially for short distances, they typically choose not to. Individuals find slower or faster speeds uncomfortable. Horses have also demonstrated normal, narrow distributions of preferred walking speed within a given gait, which suggests that the process of speed selection may follow similar patterns across species. Preferred walking speed has important clinical applications as an indicator of mobility and independence. For example, elderly people or people suffering from osteoarthritis must walk more slowly. Improving (increasing) people's preferred walking speed is a significant clinical goal in these populations. People have suggested mechanical, energetic, physiological and psychological factors as contributors to speed selection. Probably, individuals face a trade-off between the numerous costs associated with different walking speeds, and select a speed which minimizes these costs. For example, they may trade off time to destination, which is minimized at fast walking speeds, and metabolic rate, muscle force or joint stress. These are minimized at slower walking speeds. Broadly, increasing value of time, motivation, or metabolic efficiency may cause people to walk more quickly. Conversely, aging, joint pain, instability, incline, metabolic rate and visual decline cause people to walk more slowly. Value of time Commonly, individuals place some value on their time. Economic theory therefore predicts that value-of-time is a key factor influencing preferred walking speed. Levine and Norenzayan (1999) measured preferred walking speeds of urban pedestrians in 31 countries and found that walking speed is positively correlated with the country's per capita GDP and purchasing power parity, as well as with a measure of individualism in the country's society. It is plausible that affluence correlates with actual value considerations for time spent walking, and this may explain why people in affluent countries tend to walk more quickly. This idea is broadly consistent with common intuition. Everyday situations often change the value of time. For example, when walking to catch a bus, the value of the one minute immediately before the bus has departed may be worth 30 minutes of time (the time saved not waiting for the next bus). Supporting this idea, Darley and Bateson show that individuals who are hurried under experimental conditions are less likely to stop in response to a distraction, and so they arrive at their destination sooner. Energetics Energy minimization is widely considered a primary goal of the central nervous system. The rate at which an organism expends metabolic energy while walking (gross metabolic rate) increases nonlinearly with increasing speed. However, they also require a continuous basal metabolic rate to maintain normal function. The energetic cost of walking itself is therefore best understood by subtracting basal metabolic rate from total metabolic rate, yielding Final metabolic rate. In human walking, net metabolic rate also increases nonlinearly with speed. These measures of walking energetics are based on how much oxygen people consume per unit time. Many locomotion tasks, however, require walking a fixed distance rather than for a set time. Dividing gross metabolic rate by walking speed results in gross cost of transport. For human walking, gross cost of transport is U-shaped. Similarly, dividing net metabolic rate by walking speed yields a U-shaped net cost of transport. These curves reflect the cost of moving a given distance at a given speed and may better reflect the energetic cost associated with walking. Ralston (1958) showed that humans tend to walk at or near the speed that minimizes gross cost of transport. He showed that gross cost of transport is minimized at about , which corresponded to the preferred speed of his subjects. Supporting this, Wickler et al. (2000) showed that the preferred speed of horses both uphill and on the level corresponds closely to the speed that minimizes their gross cost of transport. Among other gait costs that human walkers choose to minimize, this observation has led many to suggest that people minimize cost and maximize efficiency during locomotion. Because gross cost of transport includes velocity, gross cost of transport includes an inherent value of time. Subsequent research suggests that individuals may walk marginally faster than the speed that minimizes gross cost of transport under some experimental setups, although this may be due to how preferred walking speed was measured. In contrast, other researchers have suggested that gross cost of transport may not represent the metabolic cost of walking. People must continue to expend their basal metabolic rate regardless of whether they are walking, suggesting that the metabolic cost of walking should not include basal metabolic rate. Some researchers have therefore used net metabolic rate instead of gross metabolic rate to characterize the cost of locomotion. Net cost of transport reaches a minimum at about . Healthy pedestrians walk faster than this in many situations. Metabolic input rate may also directly limit preferred walking speed. Aging is associated with reduced aerobic capacity (reduced VO2 max). Malatesta et al. (2004) suggests that walking speed in elderly individuals is limited by aerobic capacity; elderly individuals are unable to walk faster because they cannot sustain that level of activity. For example, 80-year-old individuals are walking at 60% of their VO2 max even when walking at speeds significantly slower than those observed in younger individuals. Biomechanics Biomechanical factors such as mechanical work, stability, and joint or muscle forces may also influence human walking speed. Walking faster requires additional external mechanical work per step. Similarly, swinging the legs relative to the center of mass requires some internal mechanical work. As faster walking is accomplished with both longer and faster steps, internal mechanical work also increases with increasing walking speed. Therefore, both internal and external mechanical work per step increases with increasing speed. Individuals may try to reduce either external or internal mechanical work by walking more slowly, or may select a speed at which mechanical energy recovery is at a maximum. Stability may be another factor influencing speed selection. Hunter et al. (2010) showed that individuals use energetically suboptimal gaits when walking downhill. He suggests that people may instead be choosing gait parameters that maximize stability while walking downhill. This suggests that under adverse conditions such as down hills, gait patterns may favor stability over speed. Individual joint and muscle biomechanics also directly affect walking speed. Norris showed that elderly individuals walked faster when their ankle extensors were augmented by an external pneumatic muscle. Muscle force, specifically in the gastrocnemius and/or soleus, may limit walking speed in certain populations and lead to slower preferred speeds. Similarly, patients with ankle osteoarthritis walked faster after a complete ankle replacement than before. This suggests that reducing joint reaction forces or joint pain may factor into speed selection. Visual flow The rate at which the environment flows past the eyes seems to be a mechanism for regulating walking speed. In virtual environments, the gain in visual flow can be decoupled from a person's actual walking speed, much as one might experience when walking on a conveyor belt. There, the environment flows past an individual more quickly than their walking speed would predict (higher than normal visual gain). At higher than normal visual gains, individuals prefer to walk more slowly, while at lower than normal visual gains, individuals prefer to walk more quickly. This behavior is consistent with returning the visually observed speed back toward the preferred speed and suggests that vision is used correctively to maintain walking speed at a value that is perceived to be optimal. Moreover, the dynamics of this visual influence on preferred walking speed are rapid‚Äîwhen visual gains are changed suddenly, individuals adjust their speed within a few seconds. The timing and direction of these responses strongly indicate that a rapid predictive process informed by visual feedback helps select preferred speed, perhaps to complement a slower optimization process that directly senses metabolic rate and iteratively adapts gait to minimize it. As exercise With the wide availability of inexpensive pedometers, medical professionals recommend walking as an exercise for cardiac health and/or weight loss. NIH gives the following guidelines: The situation becomes slightly more complex when preferred walking speed is introduced. The faster the pace, the more calories burned if weight loss is a goal. Maximum heart rate for exercise (220 minus age), when compared to charts of \\"fat burning goals\\" support many of the references that give the average of , as within this target range. Pedometers average 100 steps a minute in this range (depending on individual stride), or one and a half to two hours to reach a daily total of 10,000 or more steps (100 minutes at 100 steps per minute would be 10,000 steps).Charts of walking speed ranges for weight loss or health In urban design The typical walking speed of is recommended by design guides including the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges.

Numerous shrines and temples were constructed as early as the Nara period, and many of them remain active to this day. Under the Ritsury≈ç system of Nara-period Japan it is thought the area was used for extensive pasture land for horses. During the Sengoku period these small-scale ranches were revived by the Satomi clan, a powerful clan based in Awa Province.  Later history  Minamoto no Yoshitsune's gunki monogatari war tale, the Gikeiki mentions the landing of a boat party on Cape Sunosaki at the southern end of the Mineoka Mountain District. The Tokugawa Shogunate took direct control of the Mineoka pasture land, which lies between present-day Minamib≈çs≈ç and Kamogawa. As a result of the promulgated by Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's (1646 ‚Äì 1709), the use of horses throughout Japan was deemphasized. The Mineoka Mountain District was also badly hit by the 1703 Genroku earthquake. As a result, the Tokugawa shogunate divided the area into five small-scale ranches, which were used to produce dairy products, an industry that continues to this day.  Modern history  View from Mount Karasuba The relative inaccessibility of the district, as well as its proximity to the capitol in Tokyo, led to the construction of military facilities at Mount Atago during World War II. The summit was confiscated by the United States Air Force, but was returned to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). It is now home to the strategically important JASDF Mineokayama Sub-Base.

In 1932 the Museo Provincial changed its name to Museo Celtib√©rico and in 1941 both got together but maintaining its independence. In 1968 the definitive union was held and it integrates both museums being called Museo Provincial de Soria first, then Museo de Soria and finally Museo Numantino. In 1989 it took on a total reform and the exposition was amplified up to 7.000 m¬≤.  Building  The original building was one story with three wings among which there were two courtyards. In the 1980s was extended to a body of three floors in a building on the side of the courtyard. Conceived in chronological order, the visit begins in the Lower Paleolithic with the parts remaining of an Elephas Antiquus. From Bronze Age it can be highlighted weapons and tombstones and from the Iron Age, potteryare vessels and forts. From the Celtiberian stage are preserved pottery, brooches, pectorals, weapons and tools from the fields of Numancia, Uxama, Tiermes and others in the province. From the Roman period there are objects found in villages and cemeteries. Closes the provincial archaeological landscape the Middle Ages, from which there are preserved architectural ruins, pottery and coins.  Funds  It has three floors in two wings, divided into six main exhibition halls. The permanent exhibition presents, in chronological order, the history of the province of Soria. It starts at the Lower Paleolithic and passes to the Upper Paleolithic Solutrean which highlights the piece known as Placa de Villalba. The deposits of the southwest of the province provide a lot of Neolithic objects. Beaker Culture and the Bronze Age are also important pieces represented as belonging to the Covelda deposit and the Villar del Alba menhir.Gu√≠a del Museo The Iron Age has its representation obtained in several fields, but notably those of Numantia, Tiermes and Uxama. This period occupies the exhibition halls on the upper floors that make up the Celtiberian Section.Gu√≠a del Museo The Roman occupation was very important due to its social and political changes. The museum displays findings from the sites of Cuevas de Soria, Santerv√°s del Burgo and Quintanares de Rioseco also highlighting found at Numantia. There's a Visigothic representation that comes from places that were consolidated as the towns of Numancia, Osma and Tiermes. There are important Muslim pieces due to his strong presence in the province where they organised the Marca Media with capital in Medinaceli. After the Muslims left the Christian repopulation implants Romanesque and Gothic art.Gu√≠a del Museo The exhibition Celtib√©rica is also chronologically ordered and divided into three periods, the old, full and late with many pieces in all. It can be highlighted the notable funerary pediment with swords and antennas, brooches, pectorals or spiral plate and funerary urns. Also relevant is the ceramic part.Gu√≠a del Museo The route is accessible for blind and partially sighted people to whom they are addressed a number of pieces and reproductions that can be touched.

Hardwick won the World Colored Championships in both divisions. He was a member of boxing's \\"Black Murderers' Row\\" and fought the best boxers of his time. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012. Early years Hardwick was born in the City of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico to Maria Arroyo, a native of Puerto Rico, and Lewis Hardwick, an African American Merchant Marine. In 1913, his father was on leave and left the island without knowing that Maria was pregnant with his child. It was only upon his return several months later, that he found out that he was a father. The Hardwick family moved to Atlanta, Georgia when he was still a child and his father renamed him \\"Herbert Lewis Hardwick.\\" Tragedy struck the family when his father and the rest of the crew of the USS Cyclops disappeared during World War I. The loss of the ship and 306 crew and passengers without a trace sometime after March 4, 1918, remains the single largest loss of life in U.S. Naval history not directly involving combat. The cause of the ship's loss is unknown. Hardwick was only four years old. Shortly thereafter, upon the death of his mother, Hardwick went to live with his maternal aunt Antonia Arroyo-Robinson. Mrs. Arroyo-Robinson raised Hardwick and he came to identify more with his Puerto Rican heritage. Boxing career Hardwick began to box in Atlanta when he was fourteen years old under the tutorship and management of Edward Allen Robinson (Antonia's husband). He fought for the first time as a professional at the age of fifteen, on May 27, 1929 at the Elks' Restaurant, in Atlanta, against a boxer who went under the name of \\"Kid Moon\\" and was victorious in that encounter. In 1932, Connecticut State Senator Harry Durant was among those present at one of his fights in West Palm Beach. The Senator was impressed with Hardwick and sponsored his trip to New Haven where Hardwick began to fight under the name of the \\"Cocoa Kid.\\" The name printed on his boxing license was that of \\"Louis Hardwick Arroyo.\\" Hardwick used various names during his boxing career, besides using \\"Louis Arroyo,\\" he would also fight under the name of \\"Louis Kid Cocoa\\". On April 4, 1932, he won his first fight in Connecticut, against a boxer named Joe Miller. Black Murderers' Row During his career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Hardwick fought the top African-American fighters of the era in the Welterweight and Middleweight divisions. This group included, but was not limited to Charley Burley, Holman Williams, Jack Chase, Lloyd Marshall, Bert Lytell and Eddie Booker.Harry Otty (2010) Charley Burley and the Black Murderers' Row. Tora Book Publishing. . Hardwick fought Williams thirteen times, winning eight, losing three, and drawing in two. The group came to be known as the \\"Black Murderers' Row\\" or Murderers' Row and was made up primarily of highly rated African-American boxing contenders in the 1940s, who competed around the Middleweight and Light Heavyweight divisions. Hardwick was the only Hispanic of African descent in the group. Renowned for their toughness and great boxing ability, they were feared throughout the boxing world and were the most avoided fighters of their generation. According to boxing pundit Jim Murray, the Murderers‚Äô Row was the most exclusive men‚Äôs club the ring had ever known. They were so good and so feared that they had to have their own tournament.Springs Toledo (August 16, 2010) Chasing Jack Chase. thesweetscience.com The term \\"murderers‚Äô row\\" was coined by writer Budd Schulberg, screenwriter of On the Waterfront.\\"Budd Schulberg: A Bio- Bibliography\\"; by: Beck, Nicholas; Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2001. Amongst the many boxers whom Hardwick fought and defeated during his career were Louis \\"Kid\\" Kaplan. The fight occurred on February 2, 1933 at the Arena in New Haven. Kaplan was a champion who held the World Featherweight title until 1927. On December 5, 1933 he faced Lou Ambers and lost the match. From April through September 1940, Hardwick was the number one welterweight contender in the world. However Henry Armstrong, who held the World Welterweight Championship, refused to give him a title shot. On October 9, 1943, Hardwick made the cover of Knockout Magazine as \\"The Cocoa Kid.\\" World Colored Welterweight Championship The World Colored Welterweight title was created in 1936. On July 26 of that year, Hardwick met Young Peter Jackson, the holder of the Pacific Coast and Mexican lightweight titles, at Heinemann Park in New Orleans, Louisiana in a 10-round title bout referred by Harry Wills, a three- time World Colored Heavyweight Champ. Hardwick won via a technical knock-out in the second round. He made four defenses of the title. On September 22 of that year at the same venue, he defeated Jackie Elverillo on points in 10 rounds. On June 11, 1937, at the Coliseum Arena in New Orleans, Hardwick fought his old nemesis Holman Williams, prevailing in a close fight, winning a decision in the 12-rounder. Ring Magazine had donated a championship belt for the bout. Hardwick successfully defended his title against Black Canadian boxer Sonny Jones at the Valley Arena in Holyoke, Massachusetts on November 15, 1937, in a bout refereed by then former world heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey. Hardwick scored a technical knock out in the sixth round of their 15-round bout. He had devastated Jones in the third with a right to his jaw and with a right opened a cut over Sonny's left eye. Sharkey stopped the fight when Jones could barely see. The ascension of Henry Armstrong as the world welterweight champ on May 31, 1938 (when he beat Barney Ross) seemingly made the title redundant (the World Colored Heavyweight Championship expired when Joe Louis became world heavyweight champ in 1937 and the World Colored Middleweight Championship became defunct for 10 years after Gorilla Jones lost the world middleweight title in 1932), but continued to be contested during Armstrong's reign. Hardwick lost the title to Charley Burley on August 22, 1938, at Hickey Park in Millvale, Pennsylvania. Burley won a unanimous decision in the 15-round bout, knocking Hardwick to the canvas three times and defeating him decisively, taking his title. Burley never defended the title, probably out of a desire to get a title shot with Armstrong. To fill the vacant title, Hardwick and Holman Williams met in a rematch on January 11, 1940 at the Coliseum in Baltimore, Maryland. Hardwick won a unanimous decision in their 15-round title bout, winning the title for a second time. Hardwick never defended his second title. World Colored Middleweight Championship Hardwick faced Holman Williams for his World Colored Middleweight Championship on January 15, 1943 at the Victory Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. Hardwick took the title from Williams on points in the 12-round bout. He never defended the title, which became extinct. Instead, he met Williams at New Orleans' Coliseum Arena on September 15, 1944 for the \\"Duration Middleweight World Title\\". This time, the result was a draw after 12 rounds. It was his second fight after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. The Hardwick ‚Äì Billy Smith controversy In 1944, a controversy erupted between Hardwick and a boxer named \\"Oakland Billy Smith.\\" When the fighters met on November 24, in the Civic Auditorium of San Francisco, California, the betting odds favored the Cocoa Kid over Smith by 2 to 1. When Hardwick was knocked down four times, referee Frankie Brown became suspicious and stopped the fight, declaring it a \\"no-contest.\\" During an investigation carried out by the California Boxing Commission, Hardwick claimed his poor performance was due to personal anxiety about his ‚Äúsick mother‚Äù (meaning his aunt Antonia). According to the Oakland Tribune, the commission felt that Hardwick threw the fight. In addition to withholding his earnings, the commission fined him $500, and suspended him from boxing for six months. End of his boxing career On September 17, 1945, Hardwick fought and lost to Archie Moore. He lost his last professional fight on August 24, 1948, against Bobby Mann at Ball Park in Trenton, New Jersey. In 1949, Sugar Ray Robinson entered into, and then broke, two agreements to fight against Hardwick. That same year of 1949, Hardwick was Robinson's sparring partner at the welterweight king's training camp in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Robinson was training for a fight with Steve Belloise and was at his peak. In one session, Hardwick landed a short overhand right to Robinson's chin and dropped him in the second round. By the end of his boxing career, Hardwick had fought a total of 244 professional fights, of which he won 176 with 48 knockouts (KO). He lost 56 fights, 7 by way of KOs and 10 of his fights were classified as draws (ties). Among the Champions which he faced during his career were: Louis Kaplan, Johnny Jadick, Lou Ambers, Christopher \\"Battling\\" Battalino, Chalky Wright and Archie Moore. Of these he defeated Kaplan, Jadick and Wright in non-title fights. Later years After retiring from the ring in 1950, Hardwick found himself homeless and penniless in Chicago. Marguerite Winrou, his wife, divorced him and gained the custody of their children. According to the Naval Record Management Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Hardwick had served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was honorably discharged after being diagnosed with pugilistic dementia by military doctors. He kept his diagnosis a secret during his days as a boxer in order to continue boxing. Due to his long and difficult boxing career, Hardwick suffered from pugilistic dementia in his last years. In 1955, he wrote to the Navy asking for a copy of his discharge papers which he claimed were stolen with his Social Security card and was later admitted to the Veterans Administration Hospital in North Chicago. He died there on December 27, 1966 and is buried in Wood National Cemetery, section 36a, row 11, site 3, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 2011, Hardwick was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012.

He is currently the editor-in-chief of the Caucasian Knot (–ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–∏–π —É–∑–µ–ª), an online news medium established to provide unbiased information regarding political oppression, human rights violations, and the ongoing violent conflict throughout the region. In 2012, he received the Geuzenpenning for his efforts. Career  Memorial International Initially, before the creation of the Caucasian Knot, Shvedov worked with the international society Memorial, a group that focuses on researching and educating people on past political oppression, the consequences, and how it relates to their world today. The group initially started in 1989 in Moscow by initiating protests against human rights violations.http://www.memo.ru/d/6.htmlauthor=Memorial International Ten years later Shvedov began his work with Memorial. From 2001-2004 he conducted regional and inter-regional projects that focused on educating and informing the people on regional issues. From 2002-2006 he was a supervisor of 70 regional branches across Russia and other FSU countries. He still serves as a board member, and is the Director of the MEMO.RU Information Agency. Caucasian Knot Currently Shvedov is the Editor-in-Chief of the Caucasian Knot, an independent information medium that was initially under the auspices of Memorial International. The site was initially founded in 2001 by Memorial, the English version came into operation beginning in August 2003, and in 2007 it became an independent site. Initially, Memorial founded the site as an information resource dedicated to the Caucasus states, since then they have transformed themselves into a professional news source. Shvedov has a simple goal for the site: Caucasian Knot is more than a news broadcasting company. In Russia and the surrounding regions, reporting on crime and corruption can be dangerous to those involved. However, through the use of free Google applications that allow the 50 or so journalists to stay connected and report remotely from anywhere, the government cannot come knocking on the door, \\"We don't have a door, he explained. We don't have a newsroom at all.\\" This freedom not only allows the site to illuminate issues that officials may wish to keep in the dark, it also serves as a platform for discussion to those on the ground level, readers are encouraged to share and report on events going on in their location as well as interact with others on the site.

As a field that arose during the 20th century, theatre pedagogy has developed separately from drama education, the distinction being that the drama teacher typically teaches method, theory and/or practice of performance alone, while theatre pedagogy integrates both art and education to develop language and strengthen social awareness. Theatre pedagogy is rooted in drama and stagecraft, yet works to educate people outside the realm of theatre itself. History As a movement, theatre pedagogy has many founders. In Germany, where it is widely recognized and practiced, Hans-Wolfgang Nickel is cited as a pioneer in theatre pedagogy with the founding of the Berlin Stage Teachers in 1959. Nickel later became a professor of theatre games and educational activities at the Berlin School of Education in 1974. Another well known German theatre pedagogue is Hans Martin Ritter who, starting in 1973, ran a series of tests using Bertholt Brecht's model of learning through play. Ritter's aim was to develop an interdisciplinary project method for the school using theater as a form of teaching and learning. These tests led Ritter to co-found a nationwide pilot program in merging the fields of theatre and education. Perhaps theatre pedagogy's most internationally known theorist and practitioner is Brazilian director/facilitator Augusto Boal, who created Theatre of the Oppressed, now practiced by millions of people in more than 70 nations. Description The primary purpose of theatre pedagogy is to bring about change in understanding the world around us. In achieving this objective, several other skills are taught and learned. These include: * Developing language, including non-verbal and non-written language. * Honing drama skills and a theatrical vocabulary. * Use of collective action to overcome problems in the community. Theatre pedagogy enhances these forms of communication to facilitate human interaction, helping participants to learn about themselves, their peers, and their surrounding world. Rooted both in traditional education and amateur theater, the field of theatre pedagogy has grown to span many sectors, including: * Use of drama in the social sphere, such as work in prisons, with people in recovery, as violence prevention, etc. * Theatrical collaboration between laypeople and actors. * As education, both in ordinary schools and in the theatre. * In medical education improving communication between faculty and students and between physicians and patients. * In job training, integrating kinesthetic learning to teach public speaking, body language awareness, motivational training, etc. * Developing contact between theatre-makers and their audiences. * Specific theatrical techniques and dramatic forms, such as Forum Theatre and other methods from the Theatre of the Oppressed. Practitioners of theatre pedagogy operate with a situation-oriented educational framework, usually using the medium of theatre as a vehicle to achieve an objective. Through this method, theatre pedagogy gives access to participants' own ideas and impulses, expanding the avenues of communication and interaction with the self and one's sociocultural environment. Through the use of gesture, intonation, facial expression, and behavior onstage, participants analyze these performative aspects created by the dramatic tension of everyday life. Through these physical and personality- affected models, real-life situations can more clearly express themselves. Training Theatre pedagogy is taught at universities and colleges, though training in the field is not regulated by state guidelines. In Germany one can receive a theatre pedagogy degree both at the undergraduate and graduate level, and many German cities have theatre pedagogy centers that provide less formal and unregulated training. Similar to these are the Centers for Theatre of the Oppressed, such as CTO Rio in Brazil and the Theatre of the Oppressed Laboratory in New York City where people can receive theatre pedagogy training using Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire's methods. In the United States, three higher education institutions with strong theatre and drama pedagogy programs are CUNY School of Professional Studies MA in Applied Theatre, New York University Steinhardt's Educational Theatre program, and Emerson College's MA in Theatre Education.

Since gravity is stronger than the car's engine, even at full throttle, the car cannot simply accelerate up the steep slope. The car is situated in a valley and must learn to leverage potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before the car is able to make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill. The domain has been used as a test bed in various Reinforcement Learning papers. Introduction The mountain car problem, although fairly simple, is commonly applied because it requires a reinforcement learning agent to learn on two continuous variables: position and velocity. For any given state (position and velocity) of the car, the agent is given the possibility of driving left, driving right, or not using the engine at all. In the standard version of the problem, the agent receives a negative reward at every time step when the goal is not reached; the agent has no information about the goal until an initial success. History The mountain car problem appeared first in Andrew Moore's PhD Thesis (1990).[Moore, 1990] A. Moore, Efficient Memory-Based Learning for Robot Control, PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, November 1990. It was later more strictly defined in Singh and Sutton's Reinforcement Leaning paper with eligibility traces.[Singh and Sutton, 1996] Singh, S.P. and Sutton, R.S. (1996) Reinforcement learning with replacing eligibility traces. Machine Learning 22(1/2/3):123-158. The problem became more widely studied when Sutton and Barto added it to their book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (1998).[Sutton and Barto, 1998] Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. A Bradford Book. The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts London, England, 1998 Throughout the years many versions of the problem have been used, such as those which modify the reward function, termination condition, and/or the start state. Techniques used to solve mountain car Q-learning and similar techniques for mapping discrete states to discrete actions need to be extended to be able to deal with the continuous state space of the problem. Approaches often fall into one of two categories, state space discretization or function approximation. Discretization In this approach, two continuous state variables are pushed into discrete states by bucketing each continuous variable into multiple discrete states. This approach works with properly tuned parameters but a disadvantage is information gathered from one state is not used to evaluate another state. Tile coding can be used to improve discretization and involves continuous variables mapping into sets of buckets offset from one another. Each step of training has a wider impact on the value function approximation because when the offset grids are summed, the information is diffused. Function approximation Function approximation is another way to solve the mountain car. By choosing a set of basis functions beforehand, or by generating them as the car drives, the agent can approximate the value function at each state. Unlike the step-wise version of the value function created with discretization, function approximation can more cleanly estimate the true smooth function of the mountain car domain. Eligibility Traces An interesting aspect of the problem involves the delay of actual reward. The agent isn't able to learn about the goal until a successful completion. Given a naive approach for each trial the car can only backup the reward of the goal slightly. This is a problem for naive discretization because each discrete state will only be backed up once, taking a larger number of episodes to learn the problem. This problem can be alleviated via the mechanism of eligibility traces, which will automatically backup the reward given to states before, dramatically increasing the speed of learning. Eligibility traces can be viewed as a bridge from temporal difference learning methods to Monte Carlo methods. Technical details The mountain car problem has undergone many iterations. This section will focus on the standard well defined version from Sutton (2008).[Sutton, 2008] Mountain Car Software. Richard s. Sutton. http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/MountainCar/MountainCar.html State variables Two-dimensional continuous state space. Velocity = (-0.07,0.07) Position = (-1.2,0.6) Actions One-dimensional discrete action space. motor = (left, neutral, right) Reward For every time step: reward = -1 Update function For every time step: Action = [-1,0,1] Velocity = Velocity + (Action) *0.001+\\\\cos(3*Position)*(-0.0025) Position = Position + Velocity Starting condition Optionally, many implementations include randomness in both parameters to show better generalized learning. Position = -0.5 Velocity = 0.0 Termination condition End the simulation when: Position \\\\ge 0.6 Variations There are many versions of the mountain car which deviate in different ways from the standard model. Variables that vary include but are not limited to changing the constants (gravity and steepness) of the problem so specific tuning for specific policies become irrelevant and altering the reward function to affect the agent's ability to learn in a different manner. An example is changing the reward to be equal to the distance from the goal, or changing the reward to zero everywhere and one at the goal. Additionally we can use a 3D mountain car with a 4D continuous state space.  References  Implementations * C++ Mountain Car Software. Richard s.

The red zone has no official meaning during the process of playing the game and, though some professional stadiums may have special striping for the 20-yard line (usually either team colors, or a red-white-blue stripe), the area is not literally colored red (it is almost always the same color, usually green, as the rest of the field's turf). The term is mostly for statistical, psychological, and commercial advertising purposes (radio networks have been known to sell sponsorship of the red zone whenever the home team enters it). It is said to be a place where the chances of scoring are statistically higher. Being closer to the end zone, play while in the red zone involves closer cramping of the offense and defense. The short field of play means safeties have a smaller area to worry about defending, wide receivers do not have to run as far, and passes are not thrown as far. Though the distance to the goal line is less than other parts of the field, with all defenders being crammed into a smaller space and having less room to worry about defending, advancing the ball and ultimately scoring may be more difficult. The player spacing issues are less of a factor in Canadian football, where the end zones are significantly deeper and wider than in American football. For all but the weakest amateur kickers, the red zone is universally within field goal range, assuring that points will be scored on a drive unless the team on offense commits a turnover or a field goal is blocked or rarely missed. As a result, ball control is a greater priority in most red zone situations. In the \\"Kansas Playoff\\" method of settling ties, play is generally confined to the red zone.

Biography Robert Williams was born in Surry County, North Carolina on July 7, 1773. He received a liberal private education, studied law, and became an attorney. In 1796 Williams was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives, and he served three terms, 1797 to 1803. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson appointed Williams to the federal commission empowered to determine the legitimacy of land claims in the recently acquired Mississippi Territory. In May, 1805 Jefferson appointed him governor, and he served until the end of Jefferson's term in March, 1809. During his term as governor, Williams became unpopular as the result of a dispute with territorial secretary Cowles Mead, with each accusing the other of having been sympathetic to Aaron Burr's alleged conspiracy. After leaving office, Williams lived in Mississippi and North Carolina and operated plantations, also serving during the War of 1812 as adjutant general of the North Carolina militia. After the 1814 death of his wife in Washington, Mississippi, Williams moved to a plantation near Monroe, Louisiana, which he called Bon Aire. He operated Bon Aire until his death in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, on January 25, 1836. He was buried at Bon Aire, but the exact location of the grave is not known. It is the present-day site of the Baptist Children's Home and Sellers Baptist Maternity Home in Monroe. Robert Williams' brother Lewis served as a Congressman from North Carolina, and his brother John served in the United States Senate from Tennessee. His cousin Marmaduke Williams also represented North Carolina in the U.S. House.

In contrast, many quadrupeds have three distinct forms of locomotion: walk, trot, and gallop. Walking is a form of locomotion defined by a double support phase when both feet are on the ground at the same time. Running is a form of locomotion that does not have this double support phase (switched into double float phase). Preferred transition speed The preferred transition speed (PTS) is the speed at which an organism typically changes from one gait to another. Humans spontaneously switch from a walk to a run as speed increases. In humans, the preferred transition speed from walking to running typically occurs around 2.0 m/s (7.2 km/h; 4.5 mph), although slight differences have been shown based on testing methodology. Why transition from walking to running at the PTS? Humans are capable of walking at speeds faster than 2.0 m/s, and capable of running at speeds slower than 2.0 m/s. As humans can walk or run at the same pace, researchers have attempted to explain why humans choose the transition speed that they do. Early researchers suggested that humans transition from walking to running in order to minimize energetic costs. These researchers suggested that the energetic cost to run above 2.0 m/s is lower than the cost of walking above this speed. Conversely, running at speeds slower than 2.0 m/s was suggested to be more costly than walking at these speeds. This view was largely unchallenged until the late 1980s. Since that time, several studies have shown that transitioning from walking to running actually resulted in an increase in energy expenditure, while other studies have supported an energetic benefit from the transition. In the time since the energetics optimization view was first challenged, a number of mechanical, kinetic, and kinematic factors have been explored to explain the transition. Weak to moderately strong correlations have been found between several variables and the PTS, but work from a variety of researchers in the 1990s and 2000s agrees that ultimately it is fatigue and discomfort (or imminent fatigue/discomfort) in the tibialis anterior and other dorsiflexor muscles of the ankle that is the primary stimulus for the transition from walking to running in humans. Energetic factors The energetics of movement are typically measured indirectly through oxygen consumption. Most of the energy for walking is produced through the combustion of nutrients in the presence of oxygen (as opposed to anaerobic or high-intensity exercise which relies increasingly on energy that does not require oxygen for breakdown). Oxygen consumption increases when transitioning from walking to running, despite Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) decreasing. Therefore, people feel that they are not working as hard by switching from walking to running, even though their energy expenditure has increased. Humans would have to transition to running at much faster speeds than 2.0 m/s (4.5 mph) in order for the transition to represent a decrease in energy consumption. Mechanical factors Across quadruped species, there is a strong correlation between body mass and the preferred transition speed from trotting to galloping. However, in humans no single anthropometric factor explains the preferred transition speed to a similar degree. In humans the strongest correlations between anthropometric measurements and the PTS come from measurements related to leg length, with a weak correlation between PTS and body mass. In these studies, the strongest correlates came from measurements of total height and lower leg length. Considering walking with the inverted pendulum model, one can predict maximum attainable walking speed with the Froude number, F = v^2 / lg, where v^2 = velocity squared, l = leg length, and g= gravity. The Froude number is a dimensionless value representing the ratio of Centripetal force to Gravitational force during walking. If the body is viewed as a mass moving through a circular arc centered over the foot, the theoretical maximum Froude number is 1.0, where centripetal and gravitational forces are equal. At a number greater than 1.0, the gravitational force would not be strong enough to hold the body in a horizontal plane and the foot would miss the ground. Humans make the transition from walking to running at a Froude number around 0.5. even under conditions simulating reduced gravity. Kinetic factors Joint kinetic factors appear to be important in triggering trot-to-gallop transitions among quadrupeds. Stress on bones, particularly at joints, is reduced after a transition in these animals; however the same did not occur during the walk-to-trot transition among these animals. The transition therefore may be triggered by different events across species and in the trot- to-gallop versus walk-to-trot transitions in these animals. In humans, the PTS is believed by some to occur at critical levels of ankle dorsiflexor moments and power. Dorsiflexor muscles show high levels of activation when walking near the PTS and human subjects describe feeling fatigue in these muscles. Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also decrease after the transition to running, despite a higher energetic expenditure. The dorsiflexor muscles are small relative to other major muscles of the leg involved in locomotion such as the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps and the plantarflexors of the ankle. These muscles must exert large amounts of force at two points during the walking stride at high speeds: 1) The beginning of the stance phase of walking, when the heel touches down and the raised toes must be stabilized to avoid \\"slapping\\" the forefoot on the ground. 2) During the swing phase, the trailing leg is moved ahead of the foot planted on the ground and the toes must be raised to avoid colliding with the ground. Because of their relatively small size, these muscles are prone to fatigue quickly when asked to exert large amounts of force during high speed walking. The transition to running reduces the load on the dorsiflexor muscles and reduces the feeling of discomfort associated with fatigue of these muscles.

Poets of Karuvur  Among the Sangam poets, who were two groups of poets deserve attention (a) those who hailed from Karur and (b) those who sang Karuvur and the ruling Chera. A large number of poets have hailed from Karuvur and their poems are seen in Kuruntokai, Ahananuru, Narrinai, and Purananuru. The following are the poets. *Karuvur Kilar - Kuruntokai 170. *Karuvur Kannampalanar - Ahananuru 180, 263, Narrinai 148. * Karuvur Katappillai Cattanar - Ahananuru 309, Narrinai 343, Puram 168. * Karuvur Kalingattar - Ahananuru 183. * Karuvur Kosanar - Narrinai 214. * Karuvur Cheraman Cattan - Kuruntokai 268. * Karuvur Nanmarbanar - Aham 217. * Karuvur Bhutam Cattanar - Aham 50. * Karuvur Pauttiranar - Kuruntokai 162. * Karuvur Perum Catukkattu Bhuta nathanar - Puram 219.

Life and education  Born in Poznan, Poland to her father Florian Znaniecki, a sociologist, and mother Eileen Markley, an attorney, the family fled Poland to the United States due to Nazi rule. After settling in the US, Lopata finished high school and went on to college to obtain a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and finally a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. Lopata went on to teach at Roosevelt University and then Loyola University, Chicago where she served as chair of the department and Director for the \\"Center for the Comparative Study of Social Roles\\". She also took her teaching on the road as a visiting professor at the University of Southern California, University of Guelph, University of Victoria and Boston College. In 1946 Lopata married businessman Richard Lopata and had a son, Stefan and a daughter, Theodora. She died in 2003 at the age of 77 in Delavan Lake, Wisconsin. Career Highlights and Accomplishments Helena Lopata published twenty books during her career along with numerous articles. She was elected to many presidencies throughout her career for organizations including SWS, SSSP, chair of many ASA committees, and participated in many seminars relating to family and the sociology of aging. She did much research on the 'occupational housewife' that changed the way Americans looked at the changing roles of women during that time. She wrote a book on the same topic, which was the first such book. She was a professor at Roosevelt University before going to Loyola in 1969 where she did most of her research. Awards and honors Lopata received the following awards: \\"The Mead & Feminist Mentoring Award\\" from the Study of Symbolic Interaction, the \\"Meicazyslaw Haiman Award\\" from the Polish American Historical Association, the \\"Distinguished Scholar Award Society\\" for the Study of Social Problems, and lastly the \\"Bronislaw Malinowski Award\\" from the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America.
