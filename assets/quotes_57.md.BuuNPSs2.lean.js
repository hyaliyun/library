Beyond financial success, he is well known as a business visionary and a champion for human rights. Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and demonstrated that all corporations could succeed financially, while simultaneously serving the public good. He sold Reebok to Adidas in 2005, but his life and business ventures continue to reflect his philanthropy in serving people and communities throughout the country today. Early Life and Education Fireman was born February 14, 1944 in Cambridge, Massachusetts to a Jewish family and raised in the working-class city of Brockton, Massachusetts, also called 'Shoe City'. Fireman grew up with an insatiable love for golf and as a 10-year-old, caddied at Thorny Lea Golf Club in his hometown. He viewed golf as ‚Äúa code of conduct, a way of life, and a tremendous character builder.‚Äù He attended high school at Tabor Academy, a private secondary school in Marion, MA and matriculated to Boston University, but did not graduate. Personal life Fireman and his wife Phyllis (n√©e Brenner) grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts and met at age 12 at a YMHA mixer. Paul states it was love at first sight and said, ‚ÄúI knew the minute I met her it was my destiny‚Äù (Interview with Paul Fireman April 2020). They were married in May 1964 and have three grown children and nine grandchildren. alt= Fireman and his wife, Phyllis, are competitive bridge players. In 2014, his team won the Roth Open Swiss Teams at the Summer North American Bridge Championship (NABC) in Las Vegas and subsequently captured the bronze medal representing the U.S. in Chennai, India at the World Bridge Championships in 2015. Career Fireman began his career at age 18 working in the family business, Boston Camping, selling outdoor sporting goods and fishing tackle for 15 years. After starting in the warehouse, he moved his way up through the business eventually running it with his brother. As the family business declined, Fireman sought new opportunities. While attending a sporting goods show in Chicago in 1979 Fireman met Joe Foster, the owner of an English running shoe company founded in 1895 called Reebok. Fireman acquired the North American sales rights to Reebok in 1979 and eventually bought the English- based parent company outright in 1984. Reebok capitalized on the increasing popularity of aerobics in California and introduced the world's first aerobic shoe designed specifically for women in 1982 called Freestyle. Riding the success of the Freestyle shoe as the aerobics craze swept across America, Fireman grew the company and Reebok issued an IPO in 1985. In 1986, Reebok surpassed Nike as the top-selling manufacturer of athletic shoes in the United States, second only in the world to Adidas. Starting in 1986, Reebok acquired several companies to create a multinational corporation, including Avia, a rival athletic shoemaker; John A. Frye, the prestigious and stylish boot maker; Rockport, a company known for its sporting and casual shoes; and Ellesse, an Italian company known for making expensive athletic shoes and clothing. Later acquisitions included Boston Whaler and The Hockey Company (CCM). Starting in 2000 Reebok signed multiyear, exclusive licensing deals with the NFL, NBA, and NHL. During his tenure at Reebok, Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and proved that corporations can financially succeed while serving the public good. He worked diligently to improve human rights worldwide. In 1986, Reebok became one of the first companies to pull out of South Africa because of the country's practice of apartheid and two years later Reebok sponsored the Amnesty International Human Rights Now tour. Fireman subsequently established the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards in 1988 recognizing activists under the age of 30 who exposed and reduced human rights atrocities. Fireman sold Reebok to Adidas in 2005. He is currently the Chairman of Fireman Capital Partners, a Boston-based, consumer-focused private equity firm founded in 2008 with his son Dan, the firm's Managing Partner. Golf Course Development Fireman has been active in golf course development and in 1991 he purchased Willowbend Country Club (Mashpee, Massachusetts). The development of additional courses followed that included Rio Mar Resort and Country Club (Puerto Rico), Costa Caribe Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), Coco Beach Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), The Ranch Golf Club (Southwick, Massachusetts), and Starr Pass Club (Tucson, Arizona). Liberty National Golf Club (Jersey City, New Jersey) is Fireman's most impressive foray in to the world of golf. In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land that Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was ‚Äúa toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.‚Äù ‚ÄúI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,‚Äù Fireman says. ‚ÄúI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world. And I was just crazy enough to do it.‚Äù At Fireman's expense, the toxic land was cleaned to remove all residual debris, capped, and covered with 6 million cubic feet of soil that was brought in by truck to create the course. Since its opening in 2006, Liberty National has hosted three FedEx Cup playoff tournaments (The Barclays in 2009, 2013 and The Northern Trust in 2019) and the Presidents Cup in 2017. Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course. Philanthropy The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was established in 1985. Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey. Addressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation. One Family Inc. was created to prevent family homelessness through advocacy, education, and innovation. Using a multi-pronged approach, One Family advocates for public policies that will increase affordable housing and provide services to families experiencing or who are at risk for homelessness with an aim to promote permanent solutions to homelessness. The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Foundation also joined with other donors to create Home Funders, a collaborative fund that finances very affordable rental housing for low-income families in Massachusetts. Fireman is a strong supporter of The First Tee whose mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character, instill life-enhancing values and promote healthy habits through the game of golf. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping through the United States, the Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation rapidly acted in March 2020 by making donations to the Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund, the Boston Resiliency Fund, the Jersey City COVID-19 Response Fund, and the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. alt= Awards *Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, 1987 *Thurgood Marshall Corporate Leadership Award *Northeastern University Commencement Speaker and Honorary Degree, Doctor of Humanities, 1990 *Babson College, Honorary Degree, LL.D.

The Labour Party chose Harry Holland, editor of the Maoriland Worker, as their candidate who had contested the seat in 1914 for the Social Democratic Party coming third. Holland was contemplating leaving New Zealand at the time and returning to Sydney though his candidacy persuaded him to stay. Holland reveled in the personal attacks made on him which was exactly the type of recognition he craved. Campaign Peter Fraser became Holland's campaign organiser where he demonstrated great strategic skill. Holland stood on the grounds of opposing conscription, inflation and wartime 'special privilege'. Fraser encouraged Holland to directly challenge Prime Minister William Massey and Minister of Defence James Allen over the treatment of conscientious objectors in Europe which resulted in replies from both. As a result, Holland became a household name in Wellington. Results The results of the Wellington North electorate at the 1914 general election were: Results of the by-election held on 12 February 1918 were: Outcome Though the National Government retained the seat many within were alarmed by the near success of Labour. Their majority of 1,807 in 1914 shrunk to just 420 was a shock to conservative minds. At the declaration of Luke's victory, Prime Minister William Massey spoke to the crowd. He was greeted by much jeering and was pelted with eggs and rotten fruit. He lost his temper and thumbed his nose at them before storming off the stage, later re-created in an effective newspaper cartoon. A Reform sympathising newspaper, Herald, suggested improper means being used to increase the Labour vote so dramatically, saying of the results: > Mr Holland's large vote need cause no apprehension. It was made up of the > steady 1500 socialists in the electorate, reinforced by several hundreds of > 'trade' voters, hundreds of men who crowded into the boarding houses to > comply with the one month's residence qualifications, and a few cravens ‚Äî > men and women who hoped that Mr Holland might retard or stop the sending of > reinforcements to the army. However, the result was more a reflection of the growing disenchantment at the National Government bound with Labour (who refused the coalition) being seen as the only alternative. Based on his strong performance in Wellington North, Holland was chosen by the Labour Party as their candidate in the Grey by- election four months later where Holland was eventually successful in winning a seat in Parliament.

There is a hospital of the same name in Bermuda. Health services are funded by fish licence revenue and by income tax. They are entirely free at the point of delivery to Islands residents and to British residents under a reciprocal health agreement. In 2003 the provision of the service cost ¬£950 per head of population per year, similar to the cost in the UK. Services are provided to about 3000 residents. The military base provides its own health care, but makes use of the hospital facilities as necessary. This is the only hospital on the Islands. All the islands' medical, dental and community health services are based there. There are 18 acute beds, one maternity bed, a single bedded isolation unit, a two bedded intensive care unit and seven long-stay nursing beds. In April 1984, a fire destroyed an earlier wooden construction of the hospital, killing seven patients and one nurse, Barbara Chick. She was later posthumously awarded a Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct. The range of equipment and facilities is surprisingly comprehensive, as it has to be almost entirely self-sufficient and takes referrals from Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia, and Antarctica. Before 1982 medical services on the islands were very basic, but there has been considerable investment since. Colorectal cancer was particularly common on the islands, linked to a very unusual gene mutation and a three-yearly colorectal screening programme was introduced in 1997. It reached 99% of the population and appears to have virtually eliminated colorectal carcinoma. There are four full-time GPs and one part-time. A consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist do four month tours of duty on the Islands. A radiographer, a biomedical scientist, and a dental hygienist are seconded from NHS trusts. There are 2 practice nurses, a part-time nurse practitioner, 2 casualty nurses, ward nurses and healthcare assistants. The GPs have to provide all medical care apart from surgery or anaesthesia, supported by visiting specialists, mostly from the UK who help to keep them up to date. Consultations take place by telephone for patients in remote locations. There are three midwives, and about 30 babies are born each year. There are weekly visits by GPs to patients outside Stanley. Remote rural patients are provided with a \\"medicine chest\\" so doctors can instruct them to take medications based on remote consultations. Patients, or doctors, can be transported by the Falkland Islands Government Air Service if necessary. Serious emergencies are taken to Uruguay. Dr Rebecca Edwards is the chief medical officer. They use EMIS software for medical records. Sir Jack Hayward contributed to the repairs of the hospital after the 1982 Falklands War.

She is an all rounder who bats Left-handed and bowls right-arm off breakPlayers profile at CricketarchivePlayers profile at Espncricinfo and is currently ranked 4th in the top all-rounders in the ICC Cricket Rankings. Deepti Sharma is also the current third highest individual scorer by a woman cricketer in ODIs (188 runs).  Early life  Deepti Sharma was born to Sushilaa and Bhagwan Sharma. She is the youngest among her siblings. Her father is a retired chief booking supervisor with the Indian Railways. She developed interest in the game of cricket at an early age of 9. Deepti would on daily basis ask her father to request her brother Sumit Sharma (who initially coached her), a former Uttar Pradesh pacer, to take her to the ground and watch the net practices and other matches. During one of the net practices which involved her brother and his teammates at the Ekalavya Sports Stadium in Agra, she was asked to throw the ball back into play. The ball hit the stumps on a direct throw from 50 Meters distance. This was spotted by then India's national women's team selector, Hemlata Kala and it was the turning point of her life. By the time she reached the age of 15, she had enough experience but was always overlooked by the selectors for state teams selection. Her all-round abilities slowly caught the eye of few other selectors and Rita Dey a former Indian batter and selector, decided to mentor her. Deepti Sharma started off as a medium pacer but had to shift to slow off- spin bowling. The switch wasn't easy for her as it was not coming naturally. Only after guidance and counselling from her local coaches and selectors, she mastered the art of spin bowling owing to her height. She kept delivering spectacular performance in state as well as A side matches. But it was her performance against South Africa in her debut international match in Bengaluru, that she cemented her place in the national side. Career Deepti Sharma made her ODI International debut in 2014 against South Africa in Bengaluru. The match was part of the ICC Women's Championship. Sharma was involved in a world record opening partnership of 320 runs with Poonam Raut, with the former contributing 188 runs. Thus, breaking both the standing women's record of 229 (by Sarah Taylor and Caroline Atkins of England) and the standing men's record in ODIs of 286 (by Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya of Sri Lanka). This partnership helped the Indian team in scoring 358 for three in 50 overs against Ireland women at Potchefstroom during the quadrangular series which also included South Africa women and Zimbabwe women teams held in South Africa. Deepti Sharma was part of the Indian team to reach the final of the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup where the team lost to England by nine runs.Live commentary: Final, ICC Women's World Cup at London, Jul 23, ESPNcricinfo, 23 July 2017.World Cup Final, BBC Sport, 23 July 2017.England v India: Women's World Cup final ‚Äì live!, The Guardian, 23 July 2017.

Background Greek and Latin states in southern Greece, Following the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in April 1204, the establishment of the Latin Empire on the ruins of the Byzantine Empire and the treaty of partition of the latter's lands among the Crusader leaders, most of Greece was taken over relatively quickly by the Crusaders. Boniface of Montferrat established the Kingdom of Thessalonica in northern and eastern Greece, and gave fiefs to his followers in Thessaly and Central Greece. Further south, the Peloponnese was conquered by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, establishing the Principality of Achaea, under Thessalonica's suzerainty. Only Epirus remained in Greek hands, with Michael I Komnenos Doukas establishing a separate principality there. Boniface of Montferrat was killed fighting against the Bulgarians in 1207, leaving his underage son Demetrius on the throne. The powerful Lombard barons however, under the regent Oberto II of Biandrate, opposed Demetrius and his mother Margaret of Hungary, and preferred the throne to pass to Boniface's eldest son, William VI. They also opposed the Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders, and demanded sovereignty over most of the European lands of the Byzantine Empire for Thessalonica. Henry succeeded in outmanoeuvring the Lombard barons and in January crowned Demetrius king, but Biandrate and the other Lombard barons launched a rebellion across the kingdom. Henry imprisoned Biandrate in Serres and marched south through Thessaly, overcoming the barons' opposition at Larissa. Henry treated the surrendered barons leniently, allowing them to keep their fiefs. But the rebellion was not yet quelled, as the barons of Central Greece and Euboea still opposed the emperor. Parliament of Ravennika and aftermath Hoping to end the conflict quickly and without further bloodshed, Henry convened a parliament in the valley of Ravennika, a town near Lamia, in May 1209. Of the Lombard barons, only Am√©d√©e Pofey (Amedeo Buffa) came, was pardoned and re-invested with his fief. The others persisted in their rebellion and kept to their castles. The parliament did however assemble the remainder of the Frankish nobles of southern Greece, such as Otho de la Roche, lord of Thebes and Athens, and Geoffrey of Villehardouin, now Prince of Achaea. Henry received Villehardouin as his vassal, thereby subordinating Achaea directly to Constantinople rather than Thessalonica, and named him seneschal of the Latin Empire. After receiving imperial recognition of his title, Villehardouin also secured his position vis-√†-vis the Republic of Venice, by becoming its vassal in the Treaty of Sapienza in June. Henry then resumed his march south, forced the submission of Albertino of Canossa and Ravano dalle Carceri at Thebes, and went on to Athens. Biandrate escaped in the meantime and headed for Euboea, where Henry followed him. Biandrate tried to have the emperor assassinated, but Henry was protected by Ravano dalle Carceri, who was one of the triarchs of Negroponte. Biandrate was finally forced to capitulate, putting an end to the Lombard rebellion.

The former Commandery, a medieval monastery of the Knights Hospitaller, is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. Ritterhaus Bubikon  History  Assumably in compensation of claims related to the Alt-Rapperswil lands and rights, a change of goods occurred between the Counts of Toggenburg and Counts of Rapperswil probably in the early 1190s. To end the disputes about the legacy, the Knights Hospitaller abbey and commandry was given by Diethelm V von Toggenburg and Vogt Rudolf von Rapperswil between 1191 and 1198 AD. Although in concurrency to the neighbouring R√ºti Abbey, the commandery's lands and goods grew with donations by local noble families during the 13th and 14th centuries ‚Äì at the height of their power, the commandry owned land all over the present canton of Z√ºrich. Bubikon commandry in 1742, drawing by David Herrliberger so-called Bubikerhaus of the convent in Rapperswil, adjacent to the Brenyhaus nearby the Rapperswil Castle The commandry's inhabitants was granted Burgrecht by the neighbouring town of Rapperswil, later by the city of Z√ºrich. During the Reformation in Z√ºrich and the riots in the Herrschaft Gr√ºningen against the feudal owners of the lands cultivated by the farmers and their families, Johannes Stumpf, the commander of the commandry at the time, supported its secularization and those of the neighbouring R√ºti Abbey in spring 1525. The lands partially became the property of the city of Z√ºrich when the convent was secularized in 1528 (convent) respectively 1798 (commandry).

The buildings of the commandry were completely renewed in 1947, and the chapel between 1993 and 1995. In 2000 the museum was redesigned, and a herbal garden (German: Epochen- Kr√§utergarten) was established and the exterior partially renewed in 2011. The adjacent farm and barn buildings are excluded from the Ritterhaus building complex, as they still are used as a privately cultivated farm. 1782 map of the Bubikon commandery upright The Ritterhaus building complex consists of the commander's house, the rectory, the Sch√ºtte and Sennhaus buildings, the so- called Bruderhaus being the oldest building, the 12th-century chapel of St. John the Baptist (dated 1192 AD), as well as the adjacent farm and economic buildings. The brothers‚Äô house (Bruderhaus) and the chapel are the oldest buildings of the commandery and were probably built in the early 1190s, assumably incorporating an older building (maybe a chapel) that was built by the Toggenburg family. The 14th-century Romanesque nave of the chapel was expanded by a Gothic chancel that was destroyed in 1819. The remains of Romanesque mural paintings date back to the first half of the 13th century. They illustrate the foundation of the commonly named Ritterhaus building complex by the Toggenburg and Rapperswil families, and display scenes of the live of Saint John the Baptist. The chapel was desecrated and secularised during the Reformation in Z√ºrich. The main building (Haupthaus), serving as the commander's house and administration complex, and the adjacent wing (Ritterhausfl√ºgel) were added between the 13th and 15th century; after the Reformation it was the seat of the local governor, a city council member from Z√ºrich. The representative rooms were used for official purposes, and therefore richly decorated in the Renaissance style in 1570. At the same time, the coats of arms of the Knights of Malta was painted onto the fa√ßade towards the courtyard. The servants' house (Sennhaus, Gesindehaus) was built around 1480 and rebuilt in 1570 for the purpose of the production of cheese.

Finnish folk tradition includes in a broad sense all Finnish traditional folk culture. Folklore is not new, commercial or foreign contemporary culture, or the so-called \\"high culture\\". In particular, rural traditions have been considered in Finland as folklore. According to a well- known essay by Alan Dundes folklore includes at least the folk stories and other verbal tradition, music, traditional objects and buildings, religion and beliefs, as well as culinary tradition.

Poetry in Kalevala metre has been easy to remember because of its rolling metre, repeating sections and alliteration. Folk poetry collection trips, starting from the 19th century, have resulted to the world's largest folk poetry archive, which is a card index of about 2.2 million cards. These collection trips were funded by the Finnish Literature Society. It sponsored among other the ten trips by Elias L√∂nnrot. He edited the poems he and others had collected to national epos Kalevala and Kanteletar, and published collections of Finnish fairy tales and riddles. Joulupukki is a Finnish Christmas figure. The name \\"Joulupukki\\" literally means \\"Christmas goat\\" or \\"Yule Goat\\" in Finnish; the word pukki comes from the Teutonic root bock, which is a cognate of the English \\"buck\\", \\"Puck\\", and means \\"billy-goat\\".

Finnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as blueberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn).

After being laid up for about nine years, she was purchased in 1985 by the Government of South Australia for addition to the collection of the South Australian Maritime Museum as a museum ship. As of 1985, she was considered to be the only remaining steam-powered tug operating within Australian waters. Yelta was built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, during 1948 by the Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Company for Ritch & Smith of Port Adelaide, South Australia. After an 11 day voyage from Sydney, Yelta arrived in Port Adelaide on 22 February 1949. Until her retirement in 1976, she assisted vessels to and from docks and other facilities within the Port River. She also assisted in refloating vessels that ran aground within the Port River such as Eastwave in 1950, Caltex Bombay in 1952, and Ulooloo and Trykori in 1953. Yelta was retired from service in November 1976. The Port Adelaide branch of the National Trust of South Australia purchased the vessel with the objective of making \\"a feature of a maritime museum on a lease it holds on land on Cruickshank corner near the Birkenhead Bridge.\\" The plan for a maritime museum did not proceed due to the plans of the Government of South Australia to develop facilities for the South Australian Maritime Museum. In 1985, the National Trust offered the vessel for sale by tender in order to recover some of the costs expended on its own museum proposal and subsequently accepted an offer from the South Australian government who added the vessel to the collection of its maritime museum. The vessel was restored by South Australian Maritime Museum in order to \\"operate as both a floating museum and functional passenger vessel.\\" Using a team of \\"retired and semi-retired volunteers with lengthy and comprehensive experience in various maritime industries,\\" the vessel was re-launched on 5 October 1988 after three years of restoration. In 1985, Yelta was reported as being \\"Australia's last working steam-powered tug\\" and in 2017, it was described as a \\"historic vessel with strong associations with Port Adelaide, it is the only steam vessel on the river.\\" In 2017, Yelta was one of the ships considered in a study funded by Renewal SA about \\"a strategy for berthing or locating historic ships and vessels within the inner harbour of Port Adelaide.\\" References External links *'Steam Tug Yelta' video on YouTube *Image showing \\"Showing Yelta in original condition\\" Category:Ships of South Australia Category:Tugboats of Australia Category:1949 ships Category:Museum ships in Australia ","title":"Yelta (tugboat)"},{"id":"48268811","text":"Anna Branzell, also Anna Lous-Mohr Branzell, (n√©e Mohr, 30 March 1895 ‚Äì 19 July 1983) was a Norwegian-born Swedish architect. She was the first woman to earn a degree in architecture in Sweden, graduating from the Royal Institute of Technology in 1919. Biography Born in the Norwegian city of Bergen, Banzell was the daughter of Olaf Mohr, a Lutheran pastor, and Jeanette Lous. As a young girl, she had hoped to study medicine but was prevented from doing so by the effects of scarlet fever on her hearing and memory. When she attempted to study architecture at the Royal Institute, Professor Lars Israel Wahlman (1870‚Äì1952) tried to dissuade her, telling her that women architects just spoilt their hands on building sites. That convinced her she should go ahead regardless and she graduated in 1919. Thereafter she became an intern with three of Sweden's most notable architects: Gunnar Asplund, Sigurd Lewerentz and Hakon Ahlberg, before continuing her studies in the United States. In 1923, she returned to Bergen where she married the Swedish architect Sten Branzell (1893‚Äì1959). One of the Branzells' first assignments was to submit plans for renovating and extending the Kviberg Cemetery in the north of Gothenburg. They won second prize, Asplund won the competition. As time went by, Anna Branzell herself became increasingly interested in social housing, parks, playgrounds and the place of children in society. In 1932, she designed an orphanage on Uddevallagatan, now the offices of an electronics firm. Many of her drawings from the time when she participated in urban planning can be seen in the city archives. Sten Branzell, who became Gothenburg's city planner, died in 1959 but Anna lived until the summer of 1983, reaching the age of 88. They are both buried in Kviberg Cemetery.

The title track, \\"Game Changer\\" featuring Lil Raskull, was featured on ESPN's First Take, licensed by CBS for a Miami Dolphins highlight package from the team's pregame show against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and included on Miami Dolphins Coach Joe Philbin's TV show where they used the track and T-shirt for a regular segment honoring the Dolphins \\"Game Changer\\" player of the week for 17 straight episodes. The follow-up single, \\"Go Hard,\\" received additional professional sports licensing and was played on CBS during the National Football League's (NFL) Miami Dolphins 2015 preseason opener versus the Chicago Bears. The Canadian Football League's (CFL) Calgary Stampeders also used the track in games and promotional videos during the 2016 season. The album has more than just sports anthems though. Elsewhere, Rawsrvnt showcases his ability to write a love song from a believer's perspective and a newlywed. In an interview for WadeORadio.com, Rawsrvnt told Sketch the Journalist, \\"There aren't a lot of songs that both set the mood and express intimacy in ways that honor God. So instead of just complaining about it, I decided to pick up the pen and contribute my own art in that direction.\\" The end result was a cover of Robin Thicke's \\"Lost Without U\\" and an original track titled \\"Light Up the Night.\\" The album closes with a song, \\"Father I Trust Ya,\\" inspired by Rawsrvnt's life's motto that carries an inspirational message for everyone dealing with life's problems. Music videos Two music videos were released to support the Game Changer album. The first was for the title track. It was shot and edited by Factor Effects in Houston, Texas with rapper Lil Raskull who is featured on the song. The clip's storyline follows the duo recording and performing the song. And in a nod to the sports-anthem feel of the track, both artists are seen in headgear that shows support for athletic teams in their respective areas. The second visual is a filmed performance of Rawsrvnt's \\"All of the Lights\\" spoken word piece. In it, the artist shares his perspective of what it feels like to be lost, hurting, broken, and hoping for a better day. Critical reception Awarding the album three stars at CCM Magazine, Kevin Sparkman states, \\"Blending the best in dance club appeal, Eddy 'Rawsrvnt' Puyol offers Game Changer.

This offensive was later complemented by another effort starting mid-October further south, which would be aimed at cementing government control over the main logistical route to Aleppo from central Syria. The main objective of the offensive was to lift the siege on the Kuweires Military Airport, and relieve the hundreds of soldiers locked into the Kuweires pocket for almost three years, as well as to give significant depth to the main line of communication to the Syrian and allied forces in the province from the south. Also there is a possible long-term goal of cutting the Aleppo‚ÄìRaqqah highway and thereby bisecting ISIL in Syria.  Preparations  The origins of the planning of operations in the Aleppo area could be traced back to Gen. Qasem Soleimani's visit to Moscow in July 2015. Gen. Soleimani was reportedly sent to Syria by the supreme leader of Iran himself, Ali Khamenei, in order to discuss military matters with his Russian counterparts and coordinate a joint escalation of forces in Syria. Military advisers, including high ranking generals from Iran's Quds force began deploying to Latakia, and soon moving to the points of engagement throughout the country in order to plan the coming ground offensives which would be augmented by Russian air-power. With so many Iranian generals patrolling and reconnoitering the front-lines of the Syrian civil war, three of the aforementioned were soon killed in action including a very senior Guards member, Gen. Hossein Hamadani, who was deputy to Qasem Soleimani.Two Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers reportedly killed in Syria  The offensive  The situation at the airport at the beginning of the offensive. Beginning on 15 September, the government forces launched attacks along the north-western rim of the al-Jaboul Lake in an attempt to drive the ISIL militants back towards the besieged air-base of Kuweires in eastern Aleppo. The offensive began with the Army and National Defense Forces taking control of the two hilltops at Tal Na'am and Tal Sab'in, which are located just north of Lake Jabboul. However, ISIL was able to regroup not long after and launch a counter-attack in which they gained some of their lost territory and checked the rapid advance of the government forces. On 22 September, the intervention of the Syrian Air force enabled the ground forces to regain the initiative and continue their advance by capturing Salihiyah after sharp engagements with ISIL militants around the town and later gain Tal-Rayman in the drive east towards Kuweires. Before dawn of 24 September 2015, the Russian Naval Infantry went into battle for the first time since their deployment to Syria, Debka file's military and intelligence sources reveal. The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade fought with Syrian Army and Hezbollah special forces in an attack on ISIL forces at the Kweiris air base, east of Aleppo. On 4 October, the Russian Air Force attacked ISIS along the Dayr Hafir Highway, and the Thermal Plant. This allowed the government forces to enter the village of Ayn Sabil. A Syrian Army source claimed that 75 militants in the Aleppo governorate were killed in Russian airstrikes in the past two days. On 16 October, government forces and Iraqi militia, reportedly captured the town of Al-Nasiriyah, following fighting that they claimed killed 25 ISIS fighters. They then advanced to the town of Barayjeh, some 7 km from Kuweires. On 17 October, the military reportedly captured the village of Huwaija. By the next day, government forces took more areas, bringing the total of captured villages since the start of the offensive to five. On 19 October, government forces captured the village of Bkayze, about seven kilometres from the air base, as well as two other villages near the base. They also captured parts of Dakwanah. The following day, the military seized parts of the Tal Sbi'ein area. On 21 October, government forces took control of the Tal Sbi'ein area, including its hill, and two days later Dakwanah as well, bringing them to within four kilometers of the air base. On 9 November, government forces captured the town of Sheikh Ahmad, two kilometers from the air base, setting the conditions for a final assault towards the airport.The regime forces advance and reach to a distance of 2 km away from the airbase of Kwayres after weeks of clashes The situation at the airport at the end of the offensive. On 10 November, government forces lifted the siege of the Kuweires air base after three years. Subsequently, the Army captured the villages of Rasm 'Abboud and 'Umm Arkileh near the airport, as a mass ISIL retreat from areas east of Aleppo. On the next day, the military, in coordination with its allies, captured the villages Jdaydet Arbin and Arbid in the vicinity of the Kuweires airbase. In the last 24 hours of the fighting around the military airport, 60 ISIL militants, more than 20 Syrian soldiers, 13 Iranian and 8 Hezbollah fighters were killed. On 13 November, government forces advanced 4.5 km along the Aleppo-Raqqa Highway, seizing the chemical production facility and positioned themselves at the Sisako Factory. On 16 November, the air base was officially declared secured after the Army seized the village of Kaskays. This marked the beginning of a new military offensive with the aim of expanding the buffer zone around the airport.

The members of this dynasty are best known to us through Hieroglyphic Luwian sources. One member of the House of Astiruwa may also be referred to in Assyrian sources.  Astiruwa  Astiruwa, also Astiru, was the first known ruler of the dynasty named after him. Bearing the titles of country-lord, hero, and king, he ruled at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 8th century BC, possibly between 848 and 790 BC. It is not known if he had any predecessors from the same dynastic line, but it is known that two or more unknown kings of some dynastic line occupied the throne of Carchemish between him and the last known preceding ruler of Carchemish, Sangara (last mentioned in Assyrian sources in 848 BC). King Astiruwa is not known from his own inscriptions but is mentioned in inscriptions of his successors or servants. The only fact known about his time of rule is that he built craft houses. Before his death, Astiruwa chose his immediate successor Yariri as a regent for his underage son Kamani and his brothers.  Yariri  The regent Yariri (r.) and his successor Kamani (l.), the son of Astiruwa, on a relief from Carchemish Yariri was the next known ruler of the House of Astiruwa. He bore the titles of ruler and prince and reigned in the early to mid 8th century BC, probably around 790 BC. Appointed as a regent for the underage children of his deceased lord Astiruwa, Yariri had apparently also held an earlier important position, possibly as the king's vizier or at least as close confidant and advisor to the king. To be able to fulfill his obligations in these positions, Yariri got an excellent education from the king. He spoke twelve languages and was able to write four different scripts (the writing of the city = Luwian hieroglyphs, the writing of Sura or Tyre (Zura) = Urartian or Phoenician script, the Assyrian script and the writing of the Taimani = Aramaean script). During his regency, Yariri had numerous diplomatic contacts with Mizra (Egypt), Musa (Lydians), Muska (Phrygians), *475-la (Urartu?, Babylonia?) Sura (Urartu?, Phoenicia?,Maciej Popko: V√∂lker und Sprachen Altanatoliens. Wiesbaden 2008, p. 21. Tabal?) and possibly also with Assyria. During Yariri's regency, for which he may have been specially suited by being a eunuch, the situation of Carchemish was peaceful, stable and prosperous, Carchemish likely standing in good and close contact with Assyria. Art reached high levels of cultural sophistication and Yariri signed responsible for several building projects and irrigation works.  Kamani  Successor of Yariri was Kamani, a son of Astiruwa. He bore the titles of ruler and country-lord, ruling in the early to mid 8th century BC, likely around 760 BC. During his reign, Carchemish continued to be peaceful and stable. Kamani had several building projects, undertook a military conquest and resettled devastated areas. He founded and populated a city named Kamana on a territory bought from a city named Kanapu and he was also involved in land sales.  Sastura  Sastura was the vizier of Kamani. It is not known if he became king but his son is attested as ruler of Carchemish. Sastura ruled in the mid 8th century BC. The fact that Sastura or his son succeeded Kamani may be explained by a family relationship to the house of A≈°tiruwa. Sastura may have been a nephew,John David Hawkins (1979): Some Historical Problems of the Hieroglyphic Luwian Inscriptions. In: Anatolian Studies 29, p. 162. son-in-law or adopted son of Kamani, but nothing concrete is known.John David Hawkins (1982): Kubaba at Karkami≈° and Elsewhere. In: Anatolian Studies 31, p. 159.  The son of Sastura  The son of Sastura was king of Carchemish in the 2nd half of the 8th century BC, bearing the titles hero and country-lord. His name is not preserved but it may be that he is an Astiru II who can be hypothetically reconstructed from a very fragmentary text. Otherwise he might be the ruler of Carchemish named Pisiri in Assyrian sources. If he indeed is not identical with the Assyrian Pisiri, the son of Sastura could be a predecessor of Pisiri, possibly the immediate one.  Pisiri  Pisiri, the last king of Carchemish, is only mentioned in Assyrian sources for the years 738 and 717 BC. He may or may not be identical with the son of ≈†a≈°tura named in Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions. In 738 BC Pisiri was tributary to the Assyrian king Tiglath- Pileser III. In 717 BC Pisiri searched contact to Mita, king of Mu≈°ki (Midas, king of Phrygia). The Assyrian king Sargon II suspected a conspiracy by Pisiri and reacted by attacking the kingdom of Carchemish, capturing and plundering the capital of the same name. Sargon deported Pisiri, the former's family, the courtiers and the city's inhabitants to Assyria. Pisiri's cavalry, chariotry and infantry met the fate of being incorporated into the Assyrian army. Carchemish itself was repopulated with Assyrian settlers and was turned into an Assyrian province.

The Innenstadt is connected to the national and regional rail networks by the Osnabr√ºck Hauptbahnhof (main station) and the Altstadt station (formerly Osnabr√ºck-Hasetor). Another station used to operate at the Wittekindplatz: Osnabr√ºck-West, also known as Osnabr√ºck-Hannoverscher Bahnhof. The establishment of an Osnabr√ºck-Johannistor train station to connect the Neustadt area has been a topic of discussion since the year 1895. The Innenstadt was also connected by three tram lines (first opened in 1906 and gradually expanded over time): tram line 1 from the Hauptbahnhof to the Heger Friedhof (Heger Cemetery) via Hauptpost and Nikolaiort, tram line 2 from Sch√∂lerberg to Haste via Johannistor (Rosenplatz), Neumarkt, Nikolaiort and Hasetor, and tram line 3 from Martiniplatz/Heinrich-L√ºbke-Platz to Schinkel via Neumarkt and Hauptpost. Present-day urban planning continues to consider the possibility of better connecting the Innenstadt area by means of an inner- city tram or light rail network.

It is situated on a rocky hill that rises to above ordnance datum between the valleys of the River Nairn and its tributary the Allt Dearg. The site has a wide view in all directions, extending to the mouth of the River Nairn at the town of Nairn, 7 miles to the north east on the shore of the Moray Firth. Dun Evan is scheduled by Historic Environment Scotland as a site of national importance. A ruined wall surrounds the summit of the hill, enclosing an area measuring by , surviving to an average internal height of and spread to a width of up to . Facing stones and traces of vitrification were recorded from this wall in 1963 and a dip in the wall in the north east suggests it was the entrance to the enclosure. A wall enclosing a smaller area of the summit marks a second phase of the defences, probably built with stones removed from the fortifications of the earlier phase. The small size of the stones of the inner walls of the fort suggest that they were timber-laced. Within the fort a circular depression measuring approximately in diameter and deep has been interpreted as a well or a cistern. The fort is surrounded by a series of outer defences further down the flanks of the rock, including a arc of ruined walling and earthworks to the south west, and a similar arc to the north east. Within the north east tip of this second arc is a further defensive wall whose surviving height was measured in 1957 as up to , and which extended about back to the southern apex of the rock This was connected to the outer arc by two parallel radial stretches of wall about to apart, which together formed a rectilinear plan which may represent a building or reinforcing cross-walls, but appear to have been built on a larger scale than the rest of the defences.

Co-written by pianist Alberto Gianquinto and Carlos Santana, the instrumental has several jazz-inspired rhythm and time signature changes. Origins, composition and meaning As Carlos Santana stated, \\"Neshabur is where the army of Toussaint Louverture ‚Äì who was a black revolutionary ‚Äì defeated Napoleon in Haiti. So that's what it's about. I think by writing songs like 'Incident at Neshabur' and 'Toussaint L'Overture,' we felt we were our own kind of revolutionary [...] Alberto Gianquinto, our pianist on Abraxas, helped us a lot putting it together. The first part of the music is from Horace Silver's 'Se√±or Blues.' The slow part is [...] from Aretha Franklin's 'This Girl's In Love With You.'\\"Viva Santana! (1988) compilation album's 48-page booklet ‚Äì track annotations by Carlos Santana. There seems to be no place called Neshabur on Haiti or associated with the Haitian Revolution, nor has there been a single event in which the French army under Napoleon (who was never on Haiti) was defeated by the rebels under Toussaint (who had by then died in a prison cell in France). Possibly Santana confused the 1804 Haiti massacre, in which almost the entire white population of Haiti was killed, with the destruction and subsequent massacre of the entire population of Nishapur (also called Neshabur) in current day Iran by the Mongols in 1221. Releases As well as Abraxas, this song appears on several compilations such as Lotus, Viva Santana!, The Best of Santana Vol. 2, Santana and Shorter at Montreux and Santana. In the live album Fillmore: The Last Days which includes works from 14 different bands, Santana presents the song to critical acclaim. Allmusic describes the performance as \\"strong showing\\" and, despite negative review of the album, Hooterollin' Around writes that \\"only Santana really stands out, with 'Incident at Neshabur' and a unique version of Miles Davis's 'In a Silent Way.'\\"Planer, Lindsay.

Danforth assures wife Pat the dangerous assignment is strictly temporary, determined to get out of police work for good. A murder of a striptease dancer becomes Danforth's top priority. He and second-in-command Detective Geddes cast their suspicions toward hoodlum Earl Swados, attempting to persuade another stripper, Mary Abbott, to turn state's evidence against him. After charging her with prostitution, the cops spread the word that Mary is going to inform on Swados and the local crime boss, Leonard Ustick. Complications arise when another detective, Strauss, shoots an innocent bystander and police are falsely accused of beating three young men, causing neighborhood tensions to rise. Danforth takes a chance by releasing Mary, who had no intention of double- crossing the gangsters. Swados tries to murder her, chasing Mary through a brewery before Danforth and Geddes come to her rescue. Danforth resolves to stay on the job, no matter how long it takes.

The surficial geology along the sides of the stream's valley includes bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. Watershed The watershed of Beth Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Sweet Valley. The entire length of Beth Run is on public land that is open to access. History Beth Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169332. In the 1970s, the Pennsylvania Game Commission was attempting to purchase a tract of land in the vicinity of Beth Run to add to Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 57. The Pennsylvania Game Commission also once requested a permit to construct an aluminum box culvert bridge over the stream with the purpose of providing access to the southern parts of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 57 for tree salvage cutting. Biology The drainage basin of Beth Run is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. It is classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout from its headwaters downstream to its mouth.

He ruled as titular head under council of Bar Bhayat ni Jamat. Life Some regional heads revolted against Rayadhan III and deposed him in 1786. The chief actors, the Jamadars and Meghji Seth, raised Prithviraj, Rayadhan's younger brother to the chiefship who appointed during his minority a council known as the Bar Bhayat ni Jamat with Meghji Seth and Dosal Ven as its leading members. The Jamat restored the peace under the administration of Fateh Muhammad and the prosperity of the state grew. When Prithvirajji arrived at mature age, began to view with jealousy his minister Fateh Muhammad's almost absolute power. The first open rupture was in 1801 at a pleasure party, on the Bhuj lake. Bhaiji had been drinking, and on some trifling difference of opinion, he not only accused Fateh Muhammad of rebellious intentions, but would have attacked him had he not been held back. Afterwards there was a show of reconciliation, but Prithvirajji had lost trust in Fateh Muhammad, and only waited a favourable opportunity of separating from him. Matters came to a crisis, when, shortly after, the young Rao asked for and was refused the revenues of the town of Mandvi. With his friends he now planned an escape from Bhuj, and on a day when Fateh Muhammad was absent at Lakhpat, the officer in charge of Bhachau sent troops to escort the Rao to Mandvi, where Seth Hansraj, the commandant of the town, received him, declared in his favour, and drove out the militia that continued true to Fateh Muhammad's interests. On reaching Lakhpat, Fateh Muhammad heard of the Rao's flight and turning back with all speed collected his forces at Bhuj. Under Askarna Seth he sent a detachment to the Machhu Kantha to prevent the arrival of troops from the Morbi chief. This body of men did good service, attacking and defeating a formidable force coming to the Rao's assistance from Radhanpur, and then at Patri, on the way to Mandvi, defeating a detachment sent against them by Seth Hansraj . While thus successful, they were suddenly recalled to Bhuj, where Fateh Muhammad, deserted by one of his chief supporters the commandant of Lakhpat, and badly off for funds, had determined to centre his forces. The Rao now moved against Bhuj, and being joined by many bands of mercenaries, became so strong that Fateh Muhammad feeling resistance useless, agreed to surrender the capital, if he were given the estate of Bhachau. Accepting these terms Prithvirajji and Seth Hansraj took possession of Bhuj. Before leaving Bhuj, Fateh Muhammad set free Rayadhan III, a step which greatly embarrassed the new government. Rayadhan was at first most grateful to them for his freedom, and at last, with much trouble was pacified by a daily grant of about ¬£8 (300 koris). After this the place of minister became a matter of keen dispute, and Muhammad Miyan, passed over in favour of Hansraj, was so displeased that he retired to Mundra. Scarcely were these troubles settled, when Prithvirajji died at the early age of twenty-seven. Rayadhan took over the administration again but was deposed by Fateh Muhammad and made titular head under Bar Bhayat ni Jamat.

With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m2, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital. The Magritte Museum has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of Ren√© Magritte.https://www.musee- magritte- museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf Magritte Museum In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the Fin-de-si√®cle Museum as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like Constantin Meunier, James Ensor, Henri Evenepoel, Fernand Khnopff, L√©on Spilliaert and Georges Minne testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry (Maurice Maeterlinck, Emile Verhaeren, Octave Maus, Victor Horta, Henry Van de Velde, Maurice Kufferath, Guillaume Lekeu and others). Art Nouveau architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of Les XX and La Libre Esth√©tique made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the Royal Library, the Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie, the Royal Museums of Art and History, Cinematek, the Bibliotheca Wittockiana, the King Baudouin Foundation and the Brussels Capital Region for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The Fin-de-Si√®cle Museum, which was applauded internationally when it opened, welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year. Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate \\"Museum on measure\\": a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors . Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as \\"Art Nouveau Bing\\", \\"Rubens in Brussels\\", \\"CoBrA\\", \\"Alechinsky\\", \\"Leon Spilliaert\\" \\"Jordaens and Antiquity\\", \\"The Flemish Primitives in Brussels\\", \\"Andres Serrano\\", \\"Marc Chagall\\", \\"Kandinsky and Europe\\", \\"Symbolism in Belgium\\" and \\"Stanley Kubrick Photographer\\". Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small \\"cabinet exhibitions\\" on such artists Pierre Lahaut, Jules Schmalzigaug, Hiroshi Sugimoto, and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the OldMasters department like David Altmejd or Jan Fabre. For many years now, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor- Figures-2015-LO.pdf This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015‚Äì2019. The online and digital outreach of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (‚Ä† Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right. Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel's works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist's world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel's works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master's craft. The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium launched this project jointly with the Google Cultural Institute in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of Bruegel's death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era. The Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium's interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the Google Cultural Institute platform. = Royal Museums of Art and History = Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium From 1 August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director- General of the Royal Museums of Art and History. This entity includes the Museum of Antiquities, the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, Halle Gate, and the Museum of Musical Instruments. He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities ‚Äì the Royal Museums of Art and History and Royal Museums of Fine Arts. Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the Louvre and British Museum, and that of the latter would offer a more \\"national\\" foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another. Together the Royal Museums of Fine Arts and Art and History welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the Royal Museums of Art and History, the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current Museum of Musical Instruments. Plus a few heritage assets ‚Äì the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and Halle Gate ‚Äì which contribute to the attractiveness of the city. His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012. Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of Belspo Philippe Mettens, Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.

Martial Henri Valin (14 May 1898 in Limoges ‚Äì 19 September 1980 in Neuilly-sur-Seine) was a French Air Force general. He initially served as a cavalryman in the First World War. After nine years cavalry service in the chasseurs d'Afrique, dragoons, spahis, and hussars, he eventually volunteered for the French Army's aviation branch, the a√©ronautique militaire, in 1926. He commanded the Free French Air Forces from July 1941 to June 1944, and was then Chief of General Staff of the French Air Army from October 1944 until 1946. He participated in both World Wars and the Rif War. Life Martial Valin was born in Limoges. During the First World War he served as a soldier in the 4th Dragoons in 1917. He was soon selected for officer training and returned to active service in 1918 as an aspirant in the 3rd Chasseurs d'Afrique. With this regiment he took part in the battle of l'Aisne, during which he suffered from gas poisoning. In 1919 he received his commission as a sub-lieutenant and served with the 16th Dragoons, but in 1920 was sent on to the Saumur Cavalry School. He was then promoted to Lieutenant, serving with the 21st Moroccan Spahis in the French mandates in the levant and then the 22nd Moroccan Spahis in French Morocco, with whom he took part in the Rif War in 1925.

The council was chiefly led by Fateh Muhammad during both period. The council is also known as Bar Bhayyat or Bar Bhaya. History Maharao Rayadhan III, who had become unpopular and had turned religious fanatic, who tried to convert his pupils to Islam which fuelled the revolt. He was deposed by the revolt of Jamadars, the local chiefs, led by Meghji Sheth, the administrator of Anjar. He seized the palace gates, and the Rao, forced to submit, was placed under restraint in 1786. The chief actors, the Jamadars and Meghji Seth, raised Prithvirajji, Rayadhan's younger brother to the chiefship, appointed during his minority a council known as the Bar Bhayat ni Jamat which was a congregation of power. This twelve member council consisted of three members of the brothers from Jadeja ruler's family, three Mahajans (rich and influential moneylender or businessman from Hindu and Jain communities), three members from Muslim community, one member from Miyana community, one member of Gara Sadar, one member of the army. ;Under Prithvirajji (1786-1801) Initially the council was successful in restoring order in the state but soon disagreement followed. Meghji Seth of Anjar established himself there as an almost independent ruler. To his party belonged the chief of Mandvi and Aima Bai, the mother of the Prithvirajji, and by their secession, the power of Dosal Ven and the other members of the council was greatly reduced. To add to the confusion two members of the council freed Rayadhan III from restraint. The rest of the members of council left Bhuj and the disorders followed. Fateh Muhammad again placed Rayadhan under restraint. Thus he was admitted a member of Jamat. He with support of Jadeja chiefs and with his popularity in troops, Fateh Muhammad put an end to the supremacy of Dosal Ven who retired to Mundra and restored Prithvirajji to his proper position as the head of the state. As minister, Fateh Muhammad won regards of the young Prithvirajji, he secured the favour of the Jadejas by pensions ; and, by raising a powerful body of mercenaries acted with such vigour against those who opposed him all the members of the council were either banished from Cutch, or placed in confinement. Fateh Muhammad administered the state from 1786 to 1801 unified the Kutch and stabilised the order. The prosperity of the state grew and he became popular among the people. When Prithvirajji arrived at mature age, he forced Fateh Muhammad to retire with help of Seth Hansraj. He retired under the agreement of Bhachau in 1801. After this the place of minister became a matter of keen dispute, and Muhammad Miyan, passed over in favour of Rana Hansraj. Scarcely were these troubles settled, when Prithvirajji died at the early age of twenty-seven. ;Under Rayadhan III (1801-1813) Rayadhan took over the administration again after the death of Prithvirajji. He tried kill Hansraj, who saved his life by fleeing to Mandvi. Rayadhan was at last independent. But he had no funds, and before long, wasforced to call Hansraj to his help. Hansraj came, and succeeding in placing Rayadhan under restraint, carried on the government at Bhuj. About this time (1802), he offered to cede Cutch to the British Government on condition that they would grant a maintenance to Rao Rayadhan and his relations. Meanwhile, Fateh Muhammad was building port at Tuna near Anjar. His follower secretly communicated with Seth Hansraj, invited him to attack Anjar. Followers joined the force of Hansraj and attacked the town unsuccessfully. They returned to Bhuj where one day taking advantage of Hansraj's absence, on condition of a promise of the post of minister, set Rao Rayadhan free. Fateh Muhammad, after his victory, continued to advance on Bhuj and put Rayadhan again under restraint. He rose to power in 1804 and gradually won the dissenting chiefs. He used force to extract revenues and levied fines to raise the money. He took over Mandvi in 1809 after death of Hansraj and negotiated with British agent James MacMurdo regarding piracy in Arabian Sea. During the siege of Kanthkot in Vagad his army suffered so severely that Fateh Muhammad was forced to retire to Bhuj; and there, after a few days, he died on 5 October 1813. Within a month (30 October 1813) of the death of Fateh Muhammad, Rao Rayadhan III sickened of fever and died. ;Under Bharmalji II (1813-1814) On the death of Fateh Muhammad, his two sons, Ibrahim Miyan and Husain Miyan, succeeded to him in Bar Bhayat ni Jamat, their councils being directed by their father's chief adviser, Seth Jasraj. Opposing insistence of others Miyan brothers supported claim of Mansingji to the throne. On 13 January 1814, Mansingji succeeded to the chiefship of Kutch as Bharmalji II on consideration of Bar Bhayat ni Jamat. The British Government agent Captain James MacMurdo went from Morbi to Bhuj in 1814 for presenting its demands to Husain Miyan regarding end of piracy in Arabian sea and bandits in Vagad region.

The foundation stone of the college chapel was laid in 1868 and, although building work stopped in 1977, the chapel remains unfinished.http://www.lancingcollege.co.uk/2954/life- at-lancing/chapel/friends-of-lancing-chapel The chapel was dedicated to St Mary and St Nicolas in 1911 but the college had worshipped in the finished crypt from 1875. The chapel is built of Sussex sandstone from Scaynes Hill. It is a Grade I listed building and the largest school chapel in the world. Architecture The chapel as seen from the Triforium Tomb of Nathaniel Woodard in the chapel Lancing College Chapel is one of the tallest interior vaulted churches in the United Kingdom. The apex of the vaulting rises to 90 ft (27.4m) above the floor.http://www.visitworthing.co.uk/what-to-do/lancing- college-chapel-p45563 The original plans called for a tower at the north side and the foundations for it were laid but not used; the tower would have raised the height to well over 300 ft (90m). The chapel design is based on 13th Century English Gothic, with French influences. It follows a standard English Gothic plan, with a triforium and a very high clerestory. The French influences are noticeable not just in the massive clerestory, but also in the apse and the massive rose window on the west end. The rose window, designed by Stephen Dykes Bower, was completed in 1977, and is the largest rose window in England, being 32 ft in diameter. A stained glass window was commissioned in memory of Trevor Huddleston OL; it was consecrated by Desmond Tutu on 22 May 2007. The tomb of the founder of the school, Nathaniel Woodard is a prominent feature. Woodard had insisted that the chapel be built to its full height at one end first, so that if he died before completion the height could not be cut down to save money. Inside can be found three organs. The eastern organ is a two-manual mechanical organ by the Danish firm Frobenius; it was installed and voiced in situ in 1986. That year also marked the completion of the rebuild of the four-manual Walker organ at the west end of the chapelThe History of the English Organ. Stephen Bicknell, Cambridge University Press, 1999 \\\\- both organs were showcased in an opening concert by the American organ virtuoso, Carlo Curley. The chapel is open daily and attracts thousands of visitors every year. It is open from 10am to 4pm on Mondays to Saturdays, and 12pm to 4pm on Sundays.

Childhood influence Newham's biological father was Berthold Paul Wiesner, the physiologist known for coining the term 'Psi', now widely used to signify parapsychological phenomena, and who sired possibly as many as six hundred children through anonymous sperm donation at the London medical offices of his wife, Dr Mary Barton.

Newham grew up falsely believing that his mother's abusive husband Derek Joseph Newham was his biological father, and frequently attempted to discern the subject of violent arguments between them as he listened in his bedroom, from where only the timbre of the voices, including shouts, screams, and crying were perceptible.Newham, P., Therapeutic Voicework, London: Jessica Kingsley, 1998. Early work in expressive therapy Alfred Wolfsohn Newham was subsequently inspired by the life of German vocal coach Alfred Wolfsohn, and the research conducted at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Alfred Wolfsohn (1896 - 1962) was a German Jew who suffered persistent auditory hallucination of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying of wounds while serving as a stretcher bearer in the trenches of World War I, at the age of eighteen. After being subsequently diagnosed with shell shock, Wolfsohn failed to recover in response to hospitalization or psychiatric treatment, but claimed to have cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds of his hallucinations, bringing about what he described as a combination of catharsis and exorcism.Wolfsohn, A., Die Br√ºcke.

Wolfsohn was encouraged by the range and expressiveness of his own voice, resulting from the vocal exercises and techniques that he developed in an attempt to heal the symptoms of trauma sustained during the war, and began teaching others, acting as both a singing teacher and psychotherapist, seeking to combine the principles of both disciplines.Newham, P., The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre. New Theatre Quarterly, IX No. 33, February 1993, pp59-65.G√ºnther, M., The human voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn. Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, Vol. 50, 1990, pp65‚Äì75. Newham empathized with Wolfsohn's post-war trauma, having himself been traumatized by the sounds of violent arguing between his mother and Derek Newham while growing up. He therefore built upon and extended the endeavors begun at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre aligning it with cognitive and psychophysiological principles, alleging that vocalizing might have therapeutic benefits by means comparable to the expressive therapies, including drama therapy and music therapy.Storm, S., The human voice: Psychology and psychodynamic voice therapy.

Newham began applying his research while teaching severely disabled young adults, many of whom could not articulate vocal sounds into intelligible speech. By musicalizing their voices, and producing devised theatre productions in which his clients performed vocally but not verbally, Newham was able to facilitate their experience of communicating to an audience through voice.Totton, N., Body psychotherapy: An introduction. Columbus, OH, USA: McGraw-Hill Education, 2003.Benjamin, A., Making an entrance: theory and practice for disabled and non-disabled dancers. London, UK and New York, USA: Routledge, 2013. Newham subsequently began working with those who were not physically disabled, but suffered from various forms of psychological pain that they experienced as being beyond words. During this period, Newham's work was aligned to the principles and practices of active music therapy, by which patients or participants produce and perform musical compositions, with instruments and voice.Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy. Barcelona, Spain: Gilsum, NH., 1998.Kirkland, K., International dictionary of music therapy. London, UK and New York, USA: Routledge, 2013.Ludlam, S.

While researching the background to the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre, Newham met and subsequently collaborated with the British author, archivist, and curator Leslie Shepard, to produce a monograph on the life and work of the German teacher.Newham, P. The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London: Tigers Eye Press, 1997.Steinberg, M. P., and Bohm-Duchen, M., Reading Charlotte Salomon. Ithaca, NY, USA: Cornell University Press, 2006. In addition to documenting the work undertaken at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre, through film, sound recordings, and written diaries, until the founder's death in 1962, Shepard also collected thousands of documents and audio recordings relating to indigenous forms of music, meditation, prayer, and contemplative practices.Hart, R., et al, An outline of the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Subsequently published in The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and interviews. Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2‚Äì7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington: Devon, UK: Dartington College of Arts, 1985. Shepard's collection inspired Newham to consider the way in which different forms of recorded acoustic stimuli, including spoken word, music, and ambient sound, might effect a listener, potentially precipitating a range of responses including relaxation, hypnagogia, and experiences comparable to those reportedly achieved through meditation. During this period, Newham's work was aligned with the principles of receptive music therapy, by which patients or participants listen to live or recorded musical compositions, and subsequently describe their responses to the facilitating music therapist.Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy.

Newham has contributed to the theories and applications of other expressive therapies, including drama therapy and dance movement therapy.McNiff, S., Integrating the Arts in Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice. Springfield, IL, USA: Charles C Thomas Publishers, 2009. Newham's contribution to drama therapy derives from his study of possible selves, and the development of techniques by which inner voices might be vocalized with intent to interpret their significance.Casson, J., Drama, Psychotherapy and Psychosis: Dramatherapy and Psychodrama with People who Hear Voices.

Nairobi, Kenya: Kenyatta University. Newham alleges that the voice is one of the means by which a person establishes and maintains a self-image, proposing that the acoustic characteristics of a person's voice contributes to his or her personal identity.Hall, S., An exploration of the therapeutic potential of song in dramatherapy.

Meanwhile, Newham's investigations into the relationship between vocal and bodily expression have contributed to dance movement therapy by introducing vocal sound as a means of expression parallel to physical movement.Rust-D'Eye, A.

Voice and Speech Review, Vol. 1, No. 1, 2000, pp291-313. =Receptive therapy= Newham's contribution to receptive therapy derives from applying the principles of neuroacoustics, which studies neural correlates to the perception and cognition of sound, speech, and music in animals,Wind, J., Jonker, A., Allott, R., and Rolfe, L., (Eds.), Studies in Language Origins, Volume 3, Amsterdam, NL: John Benjamins Publishing, 1994.Studdert-Kennedy, M., The perception of speech. Current trends in linguistics, Vol. 12, 1974, pp2349-2385.Insect Neuroacoustics: Proceedings of a Seminar in the Animal Acoustics Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, 30 June 1976. to the field of audio therapy, which makes clinical use of recorded sound, music, or spoken words, or a combination thereof, to which the recipient listens with intent to experience a subsequent beneficial physiological, psychological, or social effect. Audio therapy synthesises elements from a number of discreet areas of research and practice, including receptive music therapy, bibliotherapy, creative visualization, guided imagery, guided meditation, sound healing, and cognitive behavioral therapy.Blenkiron, P., Coping with depression: A pilot study to assess the efficacy of a self-help audio cassette.

Newham's interpretations of the relationship between listening to sound and contemplative and reflective practices have been appropriated into reflective practice, spiritual direction, and esoteric studies.Hiley, J.

Newham has composed and recorded a number of pieces that seek to demonstrate the effect that music generally, and the human voice specifically, has on a listener, including the score for the production House of Bones, produced by Motionhouse, about 'the plight of the scapegoat and those isolated by prejudice, ignorance and difference'.WorldCat Entry 'Motionhouse'.

It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum. Since 2006 it has been determined that a more historically correct title is Double portrait of Adolf Croeser (1612-1668) and his daughter Catharina Croeser (1642-....). This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote; \\"878. SO-CALLED PORTRAIT OF THE BURGOMASTER OF DELFT AND HIS DAUGHTER. The man sits in the centre, upon the steps in front of his house ; he holds a sheet of paper. His daughter descends two steps to the left towards the spectator. The man is dressed in black ; the girl has a blue skirt and a greyish-purple gown. A beggar-woman in red, with a boy, addresses the man from the right. In the distance, to the right, is the tower of the Oude Kerk, at Delft ; to the left of the man's head is seen a small tower. A stone bridge, bearing the arms of the town, leads over the Oude Delft. To the left, in the window of the house, is a bouquet of flowers in a glass. The house projects slightly in front of the other houses in the street. The foliage of trees covers part of the picture. The picture is authentic, but not a masterpiece. The man's head is too large in relation to the girl. Since the sale of 1808 the picture has passed under the name of \\" The Burgomaster of Delft and his Daughter.\\" If the tradition is correct, the persons represented are Geraldo Briel van Welhoeck (1593-1665) with his daughter Anna, who was born in 1638, and married in 1656 Adriaan Bogaert van Beloys.

After over a century at Penrhyn Castle, the painting was sold to the Rijksmuseum in July 2004 for 11.9 million euro's whereupon it became the most expensive painting purchase for the museum. The British government delayed issuance of an export license to give British institutions the chance to buy the painting, but after the sole interested party withdrew their offer in August, the export license was issued. In 2006 research on the portrayed Delft cityscape and the people portrayed resulted in a title change. It had already been assumed for over a century that the man in the painting was not the mayor of Delft.

Personal assistance is waged support of 20 or more hours a week for people with impairments. A 2008 review reported that personal assistance is possibly beneficial to some older people and their informal carers. Further research is needed to assess which models of personal assistant are more efficient, as well as their relative total costs. Mobility Inactive patients must be turned every two hours, which is the minimum time that a bed sore can develop. To move a bedridden patient to the side, the patient is first pulled closer to the opposite side that they are turning to give room to maneuver. When the patient is turned to the side, a pillow is usually placed to the back to support that position.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 1056-1057. A pillow is often placed at the head of the bed to protect the head from any injury when moving a bedridden patient up in bed. Often the patient is turned to one side at a time to place a friction reducing sheet under the patient. When moving up, the patient is asked to bend knees and push with their legs while their chin is to their chest to prevent neck injury. The patient is pulled up either by the friction reducing sheet or draw sheet.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 1058-1060. Some of the benefits of mobility among hospitalized patients are - deep vein thrombosis, decreasing pressure ulcers and functional decline. Hygiene =Bathing= For a bed bath, a bath blanket is put over the patient and only the area washed is exposed at a time for privacy and warmth. To make a mitt out of a washcloth, the fingers and palm of the dominant hand are placed over the washcloth and the washcloth is folded over the fingers and palm. The remaining part of the washcloth not covering the fingers and palms will be folded over and tucked in and the thumb will be out of the mitt.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 896-899. The eyes are cleaned, usually first, without soap to avoid irritation. The eye is cleaned from the inner side near the nose to the outer edge to avoid carrying debris to the tear duct. The cloth is rinsed or turned before going to the other eye to prevent spreading any organisms. Each area is dried at a time before washing the next area. For perineal care, the perineum is washed from least contaminated to most contaminated to reduce the spread of microorganisms. For females, the labia is spread and washed from the pubic area toward the anal area and not the other way around. For males, the tip of the penis is cleaned first and cleaned away from the meatus. In an uncircumcised penis, the foreskin is retracted and immediately put back in place to avoid compromising circulation and the foreskin is not retracted for children in order to prevent injury. =Toileting= A bedpan. A fracture bedpan used for those with hip fractures. A bedpan is used for bed bound patients for bowel elimination as well urinary elimination for females. Powder is often placed along the ring of the bedpan to help reduce friction but is avoided if contraindicated by issues like allergies or if a stool sample is needed. Raising the head of the bead assists in voiding or defecating.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 1263. =Dressing= For those with a weaker side (such as from strokes), the arm on the stronger side is used to dress the weaker side first. When undressing, the arm or leg on the stronger side is pulled out first. The types of wound dressing are hydrocolloid dressings, hydrogel, alginate, collagen, foam, transparent and cloth. =Bedmaking= A fitted sheet goes over the mattress. Often a draw sheet, also called lift sheet, is used, where it is placed over the fitted sheet and in the center where it will be under the patient's midsection. By lifting the draw sheet, it is used to help move the patient. The fitted sheet and draw sheet, which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top sheet and blanket are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 906. Hospital bed with mitered corners When making an occupied bed, such as for patients who are unable or have difficulty getting out of bed, one side of the bed is made at a time. Usually, the patient rolls to one side and the old linen under the patient from the opposite side, such as the fitted sheet and draw sheet, is untucked and rolled as close to the patient as possible. The new fitted sheet and draw sheet are then tucked in and also rolled close toward the patient. Then the patient rolls back toward the other side. The old linen that was folded under the patient is removed and the new linen that was also folded under the patient is eased out to make the other side of the bed.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 910-911. For those for whom it is contraindicated to roll to the side, such as those recovering from hip replacement surgery, then the patient sits up in bed while the top half of the bed is made and afterward the bottom half of the bed is made. Feeding To maintain self-esteem, the person is involved as much as possible. His or her preferences are asked regarding the order of items eaten. Condiments are added and food cut according to patient preferences. Dentures, hearing aids or glasses are put in place before mealtime.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 1184. Some points to remember when feeding a helpless patient are placing the patients in a comfortable position for eating. Oral hygiene is important after eating. Examples of oral hygiene for patients are brushing the teeth, cleaning the dentures and using mouth wash. Allow patients to have sufficient time to swallow food before forcing in another mouthful. Sufficient liquid with the meal can also be provided. Make sure not to leave the patient until their appetite is satisfied. Give patients a choice of food. Wash patient's hands and face after feeding. =Swallowing precautions= For those with dysphagia, the patient has placed on aspiration (choking) precautions. The rate of feeding and size of bites are adjusted to the patient's tolerance. The diet would be modified according to the nutrition consult, such as chopping, mincing, pureeing or thickening liquids because they are easier to swallow than thin liquids. Solids and liquids are alternated to help with swallowing. The patient ideally sits upright and tucks the chin towards the chest during swallowing to help prevent aspiration. Signs of aspiration include coughing, choking, cyanosis, voice changes and regurgitation. A 30-minute rest period prior to mealtime is provided to give less difficulty with swallowing. =Visually impaired= For visually impaired patients, using a clock face analogy to relate the position of items is common. It is recommended to place foods and dishes in a similar location at each meal for familiarity. For a beverage, straws are used when possible, if not contradicted by dysphagia, in order to prevent spilling. =Suicide precautions= For those on suicide precautions, food is served in plastic or paper containers with plastic utensils (no knives) and sharp items should only be used only with continual staff supervision.

The player received praise by youth coaches Iffy Onuora and Ian Woan. In December 2004, Lapham was all set to leave his football career for plumbing after being told a professional contract with the club was unlikely. However, due to injuries to Sean O'Hanlon and Steve Jenkins in April 2005, Lapham was in contention to make his first team debut. Despite Jenkings recovering enough to be named in the starting lineup against Huddersfield, Lapham was given a debut. Lapham was one of 1/4 youth teamers to make their debuts due to Rory Fallon and David Duke being sent off. The match finished 4‚Äì0 to Huddersfield. Lapham once again received praise for his ability from the Swindon Town manager of the time Andy King, who said he \\"defended magnificently\\" when helping the youth team win the Youth Alliance cup. He was given another chance to shine for the first team at the end of the campaign against Chesterfield in a 1‚Äì1 tie. Due to Lapham's impressive performance he was rewarded with a professional contract on 6 June 2005 as well as winning the club's Young Player of the Year award. The following season Lapham had gained a knee injury preventing him from making and impression for the start of the season. After not making an appearance in the first half of the season, former youth coach and new Swindon Town manager, Iffy Onuora sent him on loan to Cirencester Town for 3 months. Upon his return to Swindon Town at the beginning of May, he was informed he was surplus to requirements at County Ground. He went on to sign a contract to Cirencester Town.

He was one of the leaders of the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues), a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891-1894. Early life Born in Trapani, the son of the lawyer Francesco Montalto and Maria Sanfilippo, he obtained a law degree. As a young man he attended the radical circles of Trapani inspired by Giuseppe Mazzini and studied the social question in Sicily. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 75 (2011) Between August and October 1890, he travelled to Germany where he came into contact with Marxist ideas, met some social-democrat leaders and was inspired to translate socialist texts into Italian, such as Thesen √ºber den Sozialismus by Jakob Stern (de).Lane, Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, Volume 2, p. 666 He changed from his original Mazzinian position towards the radical and socialistic ideas represented in Sicily by Napoleone Colajanni, with whom he would maintain a lifelong friendship. Fasci Siciliani He was among the founders of the Fasci dei lavoratori in Trapani (September 4, 1892) and became its president. He was part of the central committee of the Fasci Siciliani (1893-1894) for the province of Trapani and the regional direction of the newborn Italian Socialist Party (PSI).Clark, Modern Italy, 1871 to the present, p. 124-25 Il ¬´battesimo¬ª del socialismo, La Sicilia, May 24, 2009 Montalto maintained a gradualist and evolutionary vision of political and social struggle, criticizing the revolutionary excesses of the Fasci and dissociating from the radical tendencies advocated by the newspaper Giustizia sociale of Rosario Garibaldi Bosco in Palermo, that broke with Colajanni. Following the repression of the Fasci by the government of Francesco Crispi, he was arrested in January 1894 and was brought to trial. Scolaro, Il movimento antimafia siciliano, p. 56 Despite his opposition to the revolt and violent protest, he was sentenced to ten years in prison and two years of special surveillance by the military court in Palermo on May 30, 1894.Sicilian Rioters Sentenced, The New York Times, May 31, 1894 He was released on September 22, 1895, thanks to a pardon. Promoting cooperations After his release he continued with his reformist line focusing on the educational function of solidarity and cooperation, apparent in his writing La questione sociale e il partito socialista (The social question and the Socialist Party), published in Milan in 1899. In 1899, he was elected in the municipal council of Trapani. Due to a wave of national strikes and peasant demands in September 1901, made possible by the more liberal political climate established by the Zanardelli-Giolitti government, the socialist movement in the province of Trapani under Montalto and Sebastiano Cammareri Scurti, developed a network of socialist sections in small towns, that managed to obtain the first successes in the struggle for agrarian reform and the revision of rents. They promoted the birth and success of agricultural cooperatives interested in getting collective leaseholds from large landholders. Final years Montalto remained committed to the cooperative movement. In 1912, he left the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and joined the Italian Reformist Socialist Party of Ivanoe Bonomi and Leonida Bissolati supporting the Italian invasion of Libya. He also supported Italy's participation in World War I on the side of the Triple Entente. After World War I, he encountered enormous difficulties in achieving acceptance of his application for readmission to the PSI, and withdrew from active politics, devoting himself to the legal profession.

Initially the council was successful in restoring order in the state but soon disagreement followed. Meghji Seth, convicted of an attempt to poison some of the members, was forced to flee. Seeking shelter in his old province of Anjar he established himself there as an almost independent ruler. To his party belonged the chief of Mandvi and Aima Bai, the mother of the Prithvirajji, and by their secession, the power of Dosal Ven and the other members of the council was greatly reduced. To add to the confusion two members of the council freed Rayadhan III from restraint. The rest of the members of council left Bhuj and the disorders followed. One day Rao attacked Fateh Muhammad who had to fly for his life. Strengthening himself in one of the towers of the city wall he resisted the Rao's attacks, and with the help of Dosal Ven, defeated the Rao and again placed him under restraint. Thus he was admitted a member of Jamat. For a year matters went quietly. But Dosal Ven, the head of the council, too sure of his position, neither took pains to treat the Rao with respect nor to win the regard of the Jadeja chiefs. Taking advantage of Dosal Ven's want of popularity, Fateh Muhammad withdrew for a time from Bhuj, and, finding that the Jadeja chiefs were annoyed with Dosal Ven's treatment of the Rao, he in Dosal's absence came back to Bhuj. Always a favourite with the troops, Fateh Muhammad had little difficulty in putting an end to Dosal's supremacy and restoring Prithvirajji to his proper position as the head of the state. As minister, Fateh Muhammad won regards of the young Prithvirajji, he secured the favour of the Jadejas by pensions ; and, by raising a powerful body of mercenaries t acted with such vigour against those who opposed him, that except Dosal Ven, who retired to Mundra, all the members of the council were either banished from Cutch, or placed in confinement. =Fateh Muhammad's administration (1786-1801)= He next turned his attention to the outlying parts of the province, which during the eight years of weak and divided rule had fallen into disorder and become a prey to the raids of Miyana and Khosa robbers. Vagad was brought under order and made to pay revenue. The town of Sanva, whose unruly chief had refused to pay tribute was taken and plundered, and its bands of robbers broken and driven out of the country. After Vagad had been brought under order, only two towns resisted the Rao's authority. One of these, Mundra in which Dosal Ven had settled, was attacked and surrendered, Dosal Ven withdrawing with a pension to Betta in Abdasa. As Mandvi, the only remaining town, was too strong to be taken by assault. Fateh Muhammad made ready a fleet of boats and seized its rich trading vessels. Disgusted with their loss, the Mandvi merchants determined to quit Mandvi, whose ruler gave them no protection. Anticipating this result, Fateh Muhammad came to meet them restored their property. In return for this generous treatment the merchants went back to Mandvi, bought over the garrison, and delivered the place into Fateh Muhammad's hands. Besides in bringing disorderly vassals to obedience, Fateh Muhammad spread the Rao's power by recovering arrears of tribute from the Jam of Navanagar State, and obtained from the Girasias the cession of the Bhachau district in Vagad, which under his management became one of the richest and most populous parts of Kutch. One of his projects of improvement was to make Lakhpat a great port. A fort was built and the place prospered, its revenue doubling in a few years. With the establishment of order he introduced a system of strict and fair government in Kutch. To each district he appointed a manager, and forced them to treat the people with great consideration. At the same time, so long as they had his confidence, he placed in their hands almost unlimited power, neither listening to stories against them nor cramping them by requiring too close an adherence to rules. He thus roused an enthusiasm among his dependents who carried out his orders with a spirit and trust that ensured success. His example was worthy of his precepts. Though the number of his mercenaries was much increased, he, seldom in passing through the country, allowed one of his men to enter a village. The headmen had beforehand orders for supplies, and the greatest care was taken to prevent irregularities. During these years, Kutch, favoured with fruitful seasons, recovered from its misrule, and probably at no time was its trade or its revenue more flourishing. =Fall of Fateh Muhammad (1801)= Prosperity lasted till Rao Prithvirajji, arrived at mature age, began to view with jealousy his minister's almost absolute power. The first open rupture was in 1801 at a pleasure party, on the Bhuj lake. Prithviji had been drinking, and on some trifling difference of opinion, he not only accused Fateh Muhammad of rebellious intentions, but would have attacked him had he not been held back. Afterwards there was a show of reconciliation, but Prithviji had lost trust in Fateh Muhammad, and only waited a favourable opportunity of separating from him. Matters came to a crisis, when, shortly after, the Prithvirajji asked for and was refused the revenues of the town of Mandvi. With his friends he now planned an escape from Bhuj, and on a day when Fateh Muhammad was absent at Lakhpat, the officer in charge of Bhachau sent troops to escort the Rao to Mandvi, where Hansraj, the commandant of the town, received him, declared in his favour, and drove out the militia that continued true to Fateh Muhammad's interests. On reaching Lakhpat, Fateh Muhammad heard of the Rao's flight and turning back with all speed collected his forces at Bhuj. Under Askarn Seth he sent a detachment to the Machhu Kantha to prevent the arrival of troops from the Morbi chief. This body of men did good service, attacking and defeating a formidable force coming to the Rao's assistance from Radhanpur, and then at Patri, on the way to Mandvi, defeating a detachment sent against them by Hansraj . While thus successful, they were suddenly recalled to Bhuj, where Fateh Muhammad, deserted by one of his chief supporters the commandant of Lakhpat, and badly off for funds, had determined to centre his forces. The Rao now moved against Bhuj, and being joined by many bands of mercenaries, became so strong that Fateh Muhammad feeling resistance useless, agreed to surrender the capital, if he were given the estates of Anjar and Bhachau. Accepting these terms Prithvirajji and Hansraj took possession of Bhuj. Before leaving Bhuj, Fateh Muhammad set free Rayadhan III. Rayadhan was at first most grateful to them for his freedom, and at last, with much trouble was pacified by a daily grant of about ¬£8 (300 koris). After this the place of minister became a matter of keen dispute, and Muhammad Miyan, passed over in favour of Hansraj, was so displeased that he retired to Mundra. Scarcely were these troubles settled, when Prithvirajji died at the early age of twenty-seven. =Rayadhan III= Rao Rayadhan, who had so far submitted chiefly from respect to his brother, now insisted on resuming his authority. He tried kill Hansraj, who saved his life by a speedy retreat to Mandvi. Rayadhan was at last independent. But he had no funds, and before long, was forced to call Hansraj to his help. Hansraj came, and succeeding in placing Rayadhan under restraint, carried on the government at Bhuj. About this time (1802), he offered to cede Cutch to the British Government on condition that they would grant a maintenance to Rao Rayadhan and his relations. Meanwhile, Fateh Muhammad, remaining quiet at Anjar, busied himself in extending its trade and establishing: a harbour at Tuna Port. In these schemes and in keeping up a large body of mercenaries he spent more than his income, and looking about for some way to raise money, made so heavy a demand from his follower Askarn, that he, entering into secret communication with Hansraj, invited him to attack Anjar, and flying from the town joined his troops. They advanced together against Anjar ; but after remaining some days before the town, were forced to return to Bhuj. Shortly afterwards, at Bhuj, Askarn taking advantage of Hansraj's absence, on condition of a promise of the post of minister, set Rao Rayadhan free. But none of the districts would admit Askarn's authority or pay him revenue, and failing in another attack on Anjar he had again to fly to Bhuj. The people rose against him due to his extractions, and the Rao, hearing their complaints, ordered him to be seized and put to death. Askarn saved his life by taking shelter in Muhammad Pana's mosque and afterwards escaped with only two horsemen. =Fateh Muhammad's administration (1804-1813)= Fateh Muhammad, after his victory over Askarn, continued to advance on Bhuj, and, finding the mercenaries friendly, he was at night secretly admitted into the town. His troops had scarcely entered when they were attacked by Rayadhan, who had always a strong dislike to Fateh Muhammad, and was now determined to dispute his possession of Bhuj. Rao Rayadhan was wounded in the fight. Fateh Muhammad rose to power in 1804 but had lost his trust in Kutch militia. He gradually disbanded them, and in their stead brought in foreigners from Sindh and the neighbouring provinces. He started to bring the towns under his rule. Between 1804 and 1808 he four times advanced against Lakhpat, but on each occasion had to retire defeated. His efforts against Mandvi, where Hansraj was now settled, were attended with little better success. For a time Hansraj was forced to pay. But some excuse for refusing was always ready, and in the fight between the two rivals the whole country round was laid waste. Short of funds, Fateh Muhammad added to his revenue by levying fines and forced contributions. The whole of the Miyanas' villages were taxed, and even towns granted in religious gift did not escape. One of these exactions nearly cost Fateh Muhammad his life. Gajoji, a local chief, agreed, on promise of a share in the plunder, to help Fateh Muhammad to recover a heavy fine from the village of Fasura, The fine was levied, but the chief was paid no share of it, and at last, weary with waiting, he in open court, attacked Fateh Muhammad, and, before lie was cut down, gave him a very serious sword wound. On recovering from his wound, Fateh Muhammad, at the instigation of the chief of Adesar, marched into eastern Cutch and remained in Vagad region during the greater part of this and the two following years (1809-1812). While here, he raised large sums by fines and exactions, driving people from the Girasia towns and villages and forcing them to settle in a newly founded town which he named Fatehgadh. He negotiated with the British regarding piracy in the Arabian Sea and Bandits from Vagad region. When Hansraj died in 1809, Fateh Muhammad tried to take over Mandvi. During the next two years (1810 - 1812) Fateh Muhammad's chief care was to raise the revenue. He negotiated with British government agent Captain James MacMurdo regarding piracy in Arabian Sea and bandits from Vagad region. Kutch with other parts of north Gujarat suffered from locusts in 1811 and from a failure of rain in 1812, and in the next season, among the people reduced by want and crowded into the larger towns; a pestilence broke out that, carrying off half of their number, paralyzed the whole population. From this pestilence Fateh Muhammad did not escape. During the siege of Kanthkot in Vagad his army suffered so severely that he was forced to retire to Bhuj; and there, after a few days he died on 5 October 1813 due to the disease. Within a month (30 October 1813) of the death of Fateh Muhammad, Rao Rayadhan III died. Though he wanted to be buried as Muslim customs, his family cremated his body as Hindu customs. On the death of Fateh Muhammad, his two sons, Ibrahim Miyan and Husain Miyan, succeeded to him in Bar Bhayat ni Jamat. They raised Bharmalji II to the chiefship of the state.

History  300x300px Citizens Advice Edinburgh was one of the first Citizens Advice Bureaus established in the United Kingdom in the initial days of World War II in September 1939. Originally based in Charlotte Lane and Queen Street in Edinburgh, Citizens Advice Bureaus across the country were part of the domestic strategy to help the population during wartime. Bureaux were initially intended as a short term measure, but it was evident when the war ended there were many more problems for the population as the government tackled re-housing, employment and re-deployment, training and education, and the introduction of welfare benefits. Although originally each of the five citizens advice bureaux in Edinburgh were independent registered charities, the decision was taken in 2007 to merge the governance of each into one larger charity in order to consolidate and maximise resources in Edinburgh. = 75th Anniversary = Citizens Advice Edinburgh celebrated its 75th Anniversary of supporting Edinburgh with community based free, independent, impartial and confidential advice in 2014/2015.

History Allyson Mitchell and Deirdre Logue founded the Feminist Art Gallery (FAG) in 2010.\\" FAG‚Äôs mission is to grow sustainable feminist and queer art that proposes an alternative model for artist-run centres by not depending on formal funding sources such as government and corporate institutions. FAG provides a space for art exhibitions, and opportunities for artists who are emerging, and invisible such as queer artists and POC. Their mandate states that it \\"is a response, a process, a site, a protest, an outcry, an exhibition, a performance, an economy, a conceptual framework, a place and an opportunity. We host we fund we advocate we support we claim.\\" The gallery operates alternatively to traditional galleries in the sense that artists do not submit proposals, and Mitchell and Logue act as \\"feral curators\\", which means they look to friends and peers to suggest which artists to show. The art is also not for sale, rather the artists receive a fee from private donations raised through its \\"matronage program\\". Their most notable project are a series of banners funded by the University of Brighton for an Exhibition called \\"Civil Partnerships-Queer & Feminist Art & Activism\\". The series of four banners made of crochet granny squares read: \\"WE CAN‚ÄôT COMPETE\\", \\"WE WON‚ÄôT COMPETE\\", \\"WE CAN‚ÄôT KEEP UP\\", \\"WE WON‚ÄôT KEEP DOWN\\". These slogans are central to FAG‚Äôs mandate in which they ask \\" \\"Why would you want to be a winner in this hierarchical structure?\\" and \\"How do we both resist and reconcile our participation in this oppressive system?\\". FAG has collaborated with institutions such as SFMOMA, Tate Modern, and were the artists in residence in 2015 at The Art Gallery of Ontario.

She was born in Poperinghe, Belgium and attended the British Memorial School in Ypres. She died in 2012 in Pont-Saint-Esprit, France.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e23FkhTOazw BBC The Children Who Fought Hitler  Early life  Elaine was born to a Belgian mother, Caroline Duponselle, and an Australian father, Larry Madden, who was employed by the Imperial War Graves Commission. Elaine was the couple's only child. Her mother was 32 and died of septicaemia after a miscarriage when Elaine was nine or ten. Speaking of this time Elaine said - Her father Larry's drinking, already a problem, was worsened by the loss of his wife. His work ended with the war graves commission in March 1932, although records don't say if he left or was dismissed. Elaine remembers him saying, \\"I don't want her [Elaine], she looks too much like her mother\\". Later, after continuing in a spiral of drinking and gambling the Duponselle family paid for Larry to go to Britain where he joined the army and Elaine lost touch with him. Following her father's rejection, Elaine was sent to live with her grandparents in Poperinghe. They owned the Palace Hotel on the Rue d' Ypres in the town. She was initially schooled at the British Memorial School in Ypres but her grandparents sent away to school at a boarding convent. There she had to wear a uniform of thick black stockings and an ankle length tunic. After only a few weeks there Elaine took a pair of scissors to her uniform, cutting the tunic knee length and stockings at the ankles. After this act of rebellion the convent asked her grandparents to remove her from the school and she re-joined the British school at Ypres. In her senior year at the school Elaine was appointed an 'Elder' which was a school prefect. Elaine became aware that her Belgian family cared for her out of obligation rather than choice. At the age of 16 she was pleased to get out to London where she attended secretarial college. However, on a Christmas visit to Poperinghe a quarrel erupted between her grandmother and Uncle Charles regarding Elaine's education. Upset at this Elaine said she wouldn't go back to college, the family wouldn't have to pay for her any further.  Second World War  = The Battle of Belgium and Evacuation = At the age of 17, Elaine was engaged to Belgian officer Edgar Callant. However, her life in Belgium was disrupted when the Second World War spread to the country with the German Invasion of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Together with her 19 year old Aunt, Simone Duponselle, she set off for the coast where the pair took part in the Dunkirk Evacuation. Sheltering in a barn they were discovered by three British soldiers, Knocker, Smudger and Gary. Although another source has the soldiers passing them in a car and offering a lift. The five made their way to Dunkirk together. Elaine recalled, \\"When we got to Dunkirk about 11pm, the whole place was on fire. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it, even in films. I thought my last moment had come.‚Äù Knocker and Smudger gave the women their great coats and tin helmets to disguise them as soldiers. The three men stood around them to help Elaine and Simone blend in. Gary told them, \\"Say you're the Dorsets, if you're challenged\\". Elaine remembered they wore \\"greatcoats, tin hats, gas masks, everything except the trousers‚Äù. The women were spotted when climbing down a rope ladder into a trawler, given away when their legs were noticed. However, the captain gave them his cabin when she said she was English. Upon reaching the United Kingdom Elaine stayed with an Aunt, a Mrs. Stone, in Streatham. = The London Blitz = After arriving in Britain Elaine found work as a clerk for the British Relay Wireless Company while lodging at a flat near Fleet Street in London. Her nights were spent with the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS) assisting Air Raid Precautions (ARP) personnel searching bombed out buildings for survivors during the London Blitz. This work led her to study for her Red Cross certificates in Home Nursing and First Aid as she wanted to be of more practical assistance to casualties. Recalling the period Elaine said - = Special Operations Executive (SOE) = At the start of 1944 Elaine was twenty and living in Bayswater with a flatmate, Susan. Initially Elaine was called up for service with the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). However, with three languages and her knowledge of Belgium she felt she could be of greater service. Elaine mentioned her desire to be of greater service to an American officer who took the flatmates to lunch from time to time. He arranged a meeting for her at the American Embassy where a man was recruiting personnel for 'unspecified secret operations'. As she was British he said he would have to clear it with them in case they wanted to recruit her. The British did want her and after meeting with \\"some people in south London\\" she was recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE). There she became a member of the Belgian section. After being vetted she was sent to Lillywhites department store in Piccadilly to collect her First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) uniform. The FANY were the traditional cover for female SOE agents. In April 1944 she went to the Students' Assessment Board (SAB) in Cranleigh, Surrey. There she was given the cover name of Elaine Meeus (she was also known as Imogen and Alice) with different names again on her false papers. The course leader gave this assessment of Elaine: After undergoing further training Elaine parachuted back into Belgium in August 1944, one of only two women parachutists sent to the country. Madden was tasked with gathering intelligence on the V1 and V2 rocket launch sites. Her other mission was to protect and arrange the escape to Britain of Prince Charles of Belgium. Elaine acted as the ‚Äúeyes, ears and legs‚Äù as courier for the experienced agent Andr√© Wendelen. The other member of the team was wireless operator Jacques Van de Spiegel. Madden had close shaves in her work, including being given a lift by a German officer while carrying a radio receiver. On another occasion, one she described as the only time she ‚Äúhad trouble of any kind‚Äù, she had to loose someone following her. Remembering this period, Elaine said - She was in Brussels on 3 September when the city was liberated and joined the celebrations. At one stage she and Wendelen were left guarding a British tank while the officer relieved some of his men. At that moment some Germans ran by, Wendelen fired his revolver while Elaine fired a gun on the tank. Neither hit their target, although Elaine believed she had damaged a monument. It was at this moment that Elaine learned that the important 'Monsieur Bernard', whom she had been accompanying while arranging passage to Britain, was non other than Prince Charles of Belgium. Elaine shocked as she had been critical of Prince Charles and his brother the King while speaking with 'Monsieur Bernard'. Elaine joined an SOE group lead by Ren√© Verstrepen, to work as a coder with wireless operator Michael Blaze. The group operated in the western Netherlands providing information to the Canadian First Army. During their service Elaine and Wendelen had become lovers. With the liberation the new Belgian government had offered him the role of Belgian Ambassador to Austria. Elaine explained what happened - After SOE, Elaine volunteered for the Special Allied Airborne Reconnaissance Force (SAARF). With SAARF she was sent to the Nazi Concentration Camps to find surviving SOE agents, Belgian political prisoners and resistance workers. Her mission took her to Buchenwald, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen and Flossenberg. In her search of the camps she found only two survivors. In October 1945 she was Mentioned in Despatches for her service with SOE. Elaine was later awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Speaking of her war experiences she said, \\"I wasn‚Äôt a heroine. Just young and excited and willing to do anything except join the ATS! I wasn‚Äôt a heroine but I can still look in the mirror and feel proud\\".

The Bazaramba case is historic in Finnish legal history because it was the first time anyone was sentenced under Finland's \\"crimes against humanity\\" laws (section 1 of Chapter 11 of the Criminal Code) since the international norms against genocide were implemented in national law.http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#L11 The case was appealed up to the Supreme Court of Finland, which upheld the conviction. Life While living in Rwanda, Bazaramba worked as a teacher and a headmaster for a vocational school. Later he became a pastor in the Zambian Baptist Church. Bazaramba arrived in Finland in 2003 as a refugee. During background checks, the Finnish Immigration Service found his name in a Human Rights Watch report. The police investigation started in 2006, and the National Bureau of Investigation sent investigators to Rwanda. Bazaramba was taken into custody in 2007. Rwanda requested Bazaramba to be extradited in February 2009, but the Finnish Ministry of Justice denied the request. The trial started in June 2009 in the District Court of Porvoo. In September, the court traveled to Rwanda to hear witnesses. Bazaramba stayed in Finland and watched the sessions via a video link. In February 2010, the court traveled to Tanzania to hear witnesses from five African countries. Altogether, more than 60 witnesses were heard. In June 2010, Bazaramba was convicted and given a life sentence. According to the findings of the Finnish court, he orchestrated deadly attacks, and organised the torching of Tutsi homes. He also was convicted of spreading anti-Tutsi propaganda and inciting \\"killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis\\". The Helsingin Sanomat reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. Bazaramba appealed his conviction to the Helsinki Court of Appeal. Witnesses were again heard in Rwanda and Tanzania. In March 2012, the appeals court convicted Bazaramba and gave him a life sentence. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Finland, which denied the appeal. In 2013, Bazaramba appealed to the European Court of Human Rights with the claim that some of the witnesses had been tortured. In January 2019, the Helsinki Court of Appeal rejected Bazaramba's request to be paroled.

It has given its name to the \\"Waldalgesheim Style\\" of artifacts of the La T√®ne culture, a more fluid and confident style of decoration than early Celtic art, with Greek and Etruscan influences. The objects from the burial site were dug up by the farmer who found them on his land. The site was not investigated by archaeologists, and has recently been covered by a housing development. Site Waldalgesheim is in the middle Rhine valley to the west of the point where the Rhine is joined by the Nahe. The first objects were found there by the plowman Peter Heckert on 18 October 1869 while digging holes to plant beets. He did not attach any importance to them at first, but a passer-by said they could be historically important. Eventually a Bingen antique dealer bought the pieces for 450 Thaler. Heckert continued to explore, and eventually found over 30 pieces. It was not until the 20th century that it was recognized that the objects dated to the 4th century BC. Objects from the site including gold rings and a bronze pot are held in the Rheinischen Landesmuseum in Bonn. After the objects had been found the exact location was forgotten and no effort was made to preserve the site. In 1997 Professor Michael Sch√∂nherr tried to organize an investigation of the arable area where the site was presumed to be located, based on fragmentary records. He received no response from the state archaeologists apart from a request not to publish the location since that could attract looters. In 2002 it emerged that there were plans to build housing over the plot. Contents The Waldalgesheimer chariot burial is one of the most important finds from the early Celtic period. The grave dates from about 330 BC. It was a wooden chamber under a barrow mound, with the fragments of a two-wheeled chariot to one side. The burial dates from the La T√®ne Iron Age of the Rhineland. From the absence of warrior equipment and presence of jewelry the burial is presumed to be of a woman. Based on the rich array of grave goods, it is thought to have been that of a Celtic princess. The objects mostly belong to the La T√®ne B period, apart from a spouted flagon, which is older. The funerary offerings include gold ornaments, a bronze flagon, a bucket and bronze plaques with repouss√© human figures. The finest of the ornaments were a gold torc, an arm ring and two bracelets. The torc and the bracelets were decorated with low-relief \\"Waldalgesheim style\\" designs. The style of the objects show influences from eastern France and southern Italy. The bronze bucket from Campania probably dates to the second quarter of the 4th century BC, or soon after. The artifacts also include the fittings of the chariot. The harness and belt attachments have similar styles of ornament to the personal jewelry. Two similar sheets of bronze, badly damaged, are decorated with repouss√© busts ornamented with the new style. File:Grabfund Waldalgesheim06.jpgJewelry File:Grabfund Waldalgesheim01.jpgMiscellaneous objects File:Grabfund Waldalgesheim05.jpgBucket from Italy thumb The flagon is in Early Style. It is at least a generation older than the other objects. The precise engraving indicates that the flagon was made by skilled and specialized smiths. It is heavily worn on the body, where it would have been held when pouring, showing that it was already old when it was buried. The flagon has a flattened pedestal base, a pot belly and a tubular spout. Similar vessels have been found as far apart as Eigenbilzen in Belgium and D√ºrrnberg in Austria, and pottery versions have also been found. There is a benign human face at the foot of the flagon's handle, and a stylized ram's head at the upper end of the handle. A horse decorates the lid of the flagon, showing eastern influences. Similarities with a gilt-bronze spouted flagon found at Reinheim indicate the same artist may have made both, or they may have been made by artists from the same school. The flagon and the bronze bucket seem to have been more deeply buried than the gold torc and bracelets, which has been taken as possible evidence of two burials at different dates. However, it is entirely possible that the older objects were heirlooms buried at the same time as the more recent jewelry. Waldalgesheim style The term \\"Waldalgesheim Style\\" was coined by Paul Jacobsthal (1880‚Äì1957) for objects with similar style to those found at Waldalgesheim. It continues to draw on classical Celtic plant motifs, but marks the highest artistic level of the early Le Tene period with its confident interpretation and execution. There is disagreement about the origin of the style, with no reason to suppose that it first appeared in the Rhineland. For this reason, some archaeologists prefer the term \\"vegetal\\" to reflect the emphasis on design derived from plants, and particularly from tendrils. However, it is not the only style to use such motifs, and it included motifs unrelated to plants. Metalwork in this style appeared throughout Celtic Europe after about 350 BC. The style shows influence from the Early Style, but generally has been found in different locations apart from the Marne region of the north of France. Although the Waldalgesheimer objects were found in a late barrow, Waldalgesheimer style objects are more often found in flat cemeteries in southern Germany, Switzerland, Italy and central and southeast Europe. Some archaeologists see Waldalgesheimer influences in British objects, but this is questionable. The decorative style is found on different types of objects in different regions: sword sheaths in Italy, fibulae in Switzerland and neck rings in France. This indicates that the style was developed by specialized local craftsmen who adapted new decorative designs from Greek models, as opposed to being spread by traveling craftsmen. Ornamentation on the neck guard of the Agris Helmet The Waldalgesheimer style is less naturalistic than the Early Style, with plant motifs that characteristically flow into each other in a continuous manner. The designs subtly incorporate elements of human and animal faces and bodies. Sometimes the designs incorporate chains of triskels, or curved-sided triangles. The style includes sinuous tendrils and scrolls and asymmetrical plant spirals. The low-relief compositions have over-and-under patterns. Megaw (1970) has called the style \\"assured irrationality\\". Two basic themes are the serpentine scroll and the lyre-motif, often combined with palmette. The parade armor helmets found in Amfreville-sous-les-Monts and in Agris are examples of the style. The Agris Helmet is remarkable as an example of high-status Le Tene metalwork which may have been buried as a ritual offering to the underworld spirits. The upper and lower panels of the helmet are decorated with unconnected palmettes, and the central panel with a series of S-curves, again unconnected. The infilling designs on the center panel show similarities to the Waldalgesheim objects, while the ornament of the neck-guard shows a freer experiment with a sinuous composition.

The film depicts a week in the life of a travelling cosmetics salesman, inspired by Homer's Odyssey and the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. A road movie with amateur actors, it was aired in 1981 in television and premiered in cinema in early 1982.  Plot  This plot description follows the director's cut of 2008. On a grey autumn morning, a middle-aged man named Krieger leaves his Swiss Plattenbau home in a housing estate called Wohninsel Weberm√ºhle,Located in Neuenhof AG, see: driving a Citro√´n CX. Krieger visits beauty and hair salons, trying to sell products of the Blue Eye label, especially the Blue Dream Eau de Cologne, advertising with the slogan \\"That's how this winter smells in Switzerland\\" (in Swiss German: \\"Eso schmeckts d√§ Winter i dr Schwyz\\"). He isn't very successful. His route leads him to Basel via Olten. In Basel, Krieger visits the autumn fair (Basler Herbstmesse) after having phoned his wife from the hotel room. He drinks in a bar and in a dance hall, though rather observing the night life surrounding him than taking an active part in it. The following day Krieger drives on, into the Swiss Alps. He takes along another salesman who had his driving licence suspended. Krieger mentions to him that he was a member of the French Foreign Legion. After visiting a hair salon in a Graub√ºnden tourist village (the woman in charge mentions that Blue Eye's eye shadow doesn't sell well), they go to a local evening event with dance music. Krieger's morning shower and shave are shown extensively. He then travels without the other salesman, and now takes along a hippie sporting a full beard and felt hat. At first quiet, his new travel companion soon makes homosexual advances, but is refused by Krieger who says that he's content with his wife. Finally, Krieger throws him out of the car. After a drive through Lucerne, Krieger talks with the female owner of a hair salon. The hairdresser, talking in Basel German and smoking a lot, asks Krieger about his life and his relationship to his wife while they drink champagne. She berates Krieger for spending his time in bars and driving. According to her, Krieger is always tired when he visits her and looks in need of a hair wash\\"Kopfw√§sche\\", the German word for hair wash, means also a dressing-down. \\\\- \\"you want to sell me something, but I'd have something much better for you\\". Krieger fears for his job and stresses that he has to provide for his wife - to which the hairdresser responds asking him whether he thinks that leaving his wife alone in a tower block means providing for her. And for the rest, the hairdresser professes, she's fed up with the \\"arsehole-ness\\" (\\"Arschlochigkeit\\") of the world in general. - After leaving her, Krieger wanders aimlessly around the city streets at night-time. Another day. Krieger sleeps in his car on the side of a mountain road. A young woman walks by, he notices her and offers her a lift to Tenna. Krieger is allowed to stay overnight on her parents' farm. The four of them eat \\"Gschwellti\\" (potatoes boiled in their jacket) and conduct a faltering conversation. The father is rather suspicious of Krieger and asks the daughter - in Krieger's presence - where she has \\"picked up that one\\". Krieger gives her a flask of perfume. Krieger drives to Z√ºrich, visiting Blue Eye's office. Apparently he's looking for someone or something there, opening various doors on the floor. As Krieger argues with an employee on the floor, a big Blue Eye logo painted on a glass pane is carried to another room, followed by a photographer and female models. - Krieger goes out, into the Z√ºrich nightlife. At a bar, a middle-aged woman offers him sex; it remains unclear whether he accepts, but in the next scene, he sits alone, smoking and drinking before a stage where an Asian female singer performs Strangers in the Night. - Another bar, Krieger smokes and drinks. A young man in a leather jacket comes in, takes a seat at a table, and starts drumming fast rhythms with his hands and feet. Krieger pays and leaves, only to notice at another bar that the young guy is there again. - Krieger dances in a disco. The drummer is also there and accompanies the rhythm with a whistle. Krieger and the drummer - his name is J√ºrgen - start to hit the nightlife together and become friends. In the early morning, they drunkenly talk in the Shopville subterranean shopping mall under Z√ºrich Main Station, telling of their lives. J√ºrgen mentions that his deaf stepfather had no understanding of music at all. At the Blue Eye office, Krieger throws an empty bottle at the building. He gives J√ºrgen the key to the car and says \\"Bring me home, boy\\". On the way, they sing Somebody Loves Me. The car vanishes in the underground parking of Wohninsel Weberm√ºhle.  Background  Reisender Krieger was produced in the autumn of 1979, first aired on 6 August 1981 on the ZDF television channel, and premiered in cinema on 12 March 1982. Shot in black and white on 16 mm film, the original cut had a length of 195 minutes. Schocher's director's cut of 2008 is at 142 minutes considerably shorter. Schocher used amateur actors; he noticed his leading actor, Willy Ziegler, at a Stammtisch in Lucerne. According to Schocher, Ziegler \\"just played himself\\". In an outline of 1978, Schocher described the film as a \\"staged documentary or a documentary feature film\\".Christian Schocher: Reisender Krieger. Expos√©, included in the DVD publication, Andromeda-Film 2015. While the film follows stations and themes from the Odyssey, transferring them \\"to our country and our civilisation\\", a large part also consists of documentary shoots, showing places and landscapes in German- speaking Switzerland. Reisender Krieger was filmed without written dialogue, without artificial light, and using just a hand-held camera. According to Schocher, the manifest Dogma 95 where Danish directors made similar specifications, made him laugh: \\"Klopfenstein and me developed this earlier, we just didn't shout it out from the rooftops\\". The German title is ambiguous, as Reisender Krieger can be read as \\"Travelling salesman Krieger\\", but also as \\"Travelling Warrior\\". \\"Reisender\\" means specifically a travelling salesman as well as more generally one who travels, and \\"Krieger\\" is a family name, but also the German word for warrior. In 2015, the director's cut was published on DVD with German, French, and English subtitles.  Themes  Schocher's outline mentions various counterparts for characters from the Odyssey. For example, Kriegers wife who waits at home is Penelope, the Graub√ºnden farmer's daughter stands for Nausicaa, her father for Alcinous - and the drummer J√ºrgen is Telemachus, \\"whom Krieger, on a booze-cruise, beholds as his own, freer mirror image, and accepts as his son for one night.\\"  Critical response  At the time of its first release, Reisender Krieger was reviewed positively in Swiss and German media. Karsten Witte wrote 1982 in the German newspaper Die Zeit of a \\"sneaky fascination\\" by the movie. At first, the viewer would ask where the journey is supposed to lead, but soon one couldn't get enough of the \\"richness of these images\\". According to Witte, Schocher is \\"a pioneer who invents cinema anew, one who cunningly mixes magic with myth\\". Also in retrospect and after publication of the director's cut, the film received a positive response. Wolfram Knorr described it in a Weltwoche article on occasion of the 66th Locarno International Film Festival (2013) as a \\"masterpiece of form and fantasy about Switzerland\\" and as by far the best Swiss movie, which, however, didn't inspire others to follow with similar studies. The German Lexikon des internationalen Films attests the movie to be \\"excellently photographed\\" and describes it as trying to show alienation and the inability to communicate in modern society by the example of Krieger's conduct of life. In the Lexikon Filme im Fernsehen by Adolf Heinzlmeier and Berndt Schulz, Reisender Krieger is described as a film \\"that precisely realizes the ambiguity of its title\\".

In 1954 she designed housing for miners in Tatab√°nya and during 1955‚Äì1956 she worked on a school and housing projects. Eva Vecsei and her husband, Andr√© Vecsei, who married in 1952, emigrated to Canada after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and settled in Montreal in 1957. She became a naturalized citizen of Canada in 1962. In 1958 she began working for the architectural firm Arcop, where she was in charge of design development of eight Massey Award winning projects. Vecsei was the senior project designer on the construction of Place Bonaventure from 1964 to 1967. Place Bonaventure was among the most significant projects of her career, and press coverage of the building's construction at the time highlighted Vecsei's gender and innovative construction methods. Vecsei left Arcop in 1971 to join Dimitri Dimakopoulos' practice. She worked there until 1973, when she opened her own practice, Eva H. Vecsei Architect, in Montreal. Her first major project in her newly established firm was La Cit√©, the largest mixed use, high-density project in Canada at the time. Located in downtown Montreal it is comprised an office building, a hotel, three residential tower blocks, and a retail area - construction from 1973 to 1977. La Cit√© was the first residential development in Montreal with a green rooftop serving the residents. In 1976 Yasmeen Lari architect invited Eva Vecsei as Architectural Consultant on the Karachi Trade and Finance Center, in Karachi, Pakistan. In 1983 at the invitation of the Chinese Government, RAIC sponsored ten Canadian architects on a lecture tour to China. Eva Vecsei was asked by the Beijing School of Architecture to present the La Cit√© project. Vecsei and her husband later went into practice together, co-establishing Vecsei Architects in 1984. In the next 20 years they produced numerous public projects such as: College Marie de France, Elementary School, Montreal, Library and Cultural Centre, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Municipal Library, St. Lambert, Manoir Montefiore, Seniors Condominium, Cote St. Luc., Ark and Artworks for the Beth Zion Synagogue, Cote St. Luc and several planning studies. Husband and architectural partner Andre Vecsei died in 2006. Vecsei has received numerous honours throughout her architectural career. She became a fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1988 and was made an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1990. She won the Canadian Architect Award of Excellence in 1983 and the M√©daille du M√©rite from the Order of Architects of Quebec in 2004.

Twining, the son of Stephen Twining and Almira (Catlin) Twining, was born in New Haven, Conn., July 5, 1801. He graduated from Yale College in 1820. He left College with the intention of entering the ministry, and soon after studied for one year in Andover Theological Seminary. In 1823 he returned to New Haven as tutor in at Yale, in which office he served for two years. Meanwhile he had decided to become a civil engineer, and now went to West Point to prepare himself for his profession. He was first employed upon the State works of Pennsylvania, and his earliest independent work was in 1835‚Äì37 as chief of the survey for the Hartford and New Haven Railroad; he was subsequently employed either as chief or consulting engineer upon every railroad running out of New Haven (excepting possibly the Derby road). In like manner he was employed on the northern lines running up the Connecticut River valley and through Vermont, on the Lake Shore road between Buffalo and Erie, and on other roads in Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. From 1839 to 1848 he filled the chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Middlebury College, Vt.; this position he resigned to give himself more fully to his engineering labors. He removed from Middlebury to New Haven in 1852, and resided there for the rest of his life. From 1856 until his death he was a deacon in the First Church, in which his father had filled the same office. For several years after his return to New Haven his labor was mainly given to the development of his invention for the artificial production of ice economically on a large scale. The principle of his invention was widely adopted, but he failed to secure pecuniary recompense for it. He made valuable original investigations in astronomy, mathematics and physics, and was equally interested in questions of theology and political science, both in their theoretical and practical aspects In connection with the remarkable meteor shower of November 1833, he deserves the credit for first suggesting the correct theory of radiation of meteor tracks from a fixed point among the stars. Early in October 1884, he was attacked with congestion of the brain, and died at his home in New Haven on November 22, at the age of 83. On March 2, 1829, Twining married Harriet Amelia Kinsley, of West Point, N. Y., who died October 12, 1871. Their children were three sons (graduates of Yale) and four daughters, including the Rev. Kingsley Twining; they survived their parents, with the exception of one son who died in the American Civil War.

It was founded in 2000 and has been developing natural language understanding and natural language generation (together, dialogue) software since 2001.  History  The company was founded by Eugene Joseph in 2000, after his first company, Virtual Prototypes Inc., went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in July 1999; that company currently operates as Presagis, a wholly owned subsidiary of CAE.Presagis website In the early 2000, North Side did R&D; work funded in part by the Canadian Department of National Defence and National Research Council and Telefilm Canada.See end of Bot Colony paper. In 2007, North Side embarked on the development of Bot Colony, the first video game making coherent English dialogue with the characters an integral part of gameplay. The game development was financed in part by the Canada Media Fund. The first two episodes of Bot Colony were launched on Steam on June 17, 2014. Work on Bot Colony started in 2007 (preliminary work on parsing, ontologies, reasoning started much earlier in 2001). At the peak in 2014, the team had 45 members. The company spent a cumulative $23 million on the project, of which $20 million went towards R&D; in natural language understanding.  Current activities  The company launched VerbalAccessVerbalAccess, North Side. at Finovate in New York City on September 16, 2015. VerbalAccess provides an English interface to financial services, enabling both transactions and interactive FAQ in English. The ability to do banking transactions completely hands-off enables a person to bank through speech while driving, walking, etc. The technology also supports transactions via text-messages. The knowledge base of VerbalAccess spans financial services encompassing banking, credit cards, creditworthiness and loans, savings, and to a more limited extent, insurance and investments.  Technology  For Bot Colony, North Side improved the natural language understanding pipeline by adding a semantic reasoner able to reason on logical axioms expressed in English (the equivalent of Prolog with predicates in English) and on formalized procedural knowledge expressed in English. A key feature distinguishing North Side's technology from an intelligent personal assistant based on machine learning, such as Apple's Siri, Google's Now, Microsoft's Cortana, Nuance's Nina or IBM's Watson, is its ability to clarify ambiguous or incomplete input and handle paraphrases, using a deterministic, rule-based approach. North Side relies on advances in parsing and disambiguation to understand language more precisely, making financial transactions through voice or text-messaging feasible. The underlying database technology supporting North Side's NLU technology is the Versant Object Database from Actian.

It has been part of the district town of Heinsberg since 1972. It includes the main village Dremmen and the villages Herb and Boverath. Geography The neighbouring towns are H√ºlhoven, Grebben in the north-west, Oberbruch in the north, Porselen the east, Randerath in the Southeast and in the South Uetterath. =Geology= Dremmen is located at the edge of the Rur valley it is hillier than the surrounding areas. Meadows, fields and woods dominate the landscape. In some places there is sand mining. =Rivers= The River Rur is the largest river in the district it flows past Heinsberg into Bleckden near Dremmen. The Rur frequently floods as far as Oberbruch. The river Wurm is by the North East side of Dremmen where the industrial area is situated by H√ºckelhoven. A small watercourse called Geilenkirchen-Rischden today runs underground in its place. History In the Middle Ages a M√ºhlengraben (channel for the operation of water mills) was created, at Randerath where the river Wurm branched off. It ran along the edge of the Wurm. Horst, Porselen, Dremmen and Schafhausen spurred numerous watermills in this period. In the city of Heinsberg it was destroyed during the Second World War (Jan 1945: Operation Blackcock) and wasn't restored after, the channel was instead used to irrigate agricultural land. The history of the parish of St. Lambertus can be traced back to the 8th century. The former wooden church burned down in the late 9th century. In the 10th to 11th Century a small hall church made of stone was built at the same place. In 1201, the name of the oldest known pastor of Dremmen was written into the records as: \\"Nykolaus pastor in drumme\\". The church hall was repeatedly rebuilt and expanded (Gothic choir Attachments, aisles, Gothic brick tower 1515). In 1716, it burned out completely; after 1721 another new church was built. From 1760 the church seemed too small. By the early 19th century it was dilapidated. In 1834, the nave was demolished but the tower remained standing. A new three-nave section and room in the classical style was built; In 1835, it was inaugurated. The altar and the modern Calvary dates from the year 1981, the large mural in the presbytery dates from 1993.Altar geschaffen von Rudolf Peer, Kreuzweg von Klaus Iserlohe The organ dates back to 1836, it is from the postwar period with two manuals and 24 registers. In the tower there are five bells that have been hanging since 1953 with the hit tones B0 - c '- it' - f '- g'. Built in 1890, the railway line Heinsberg-Lindern (\\"Wurm Switchback\\") also runs past Dremmen. The local station is no longer used. On January 1, 1969, Dremmen was incorporated into Oberbruch-Dremmen.Seit dem 1. Januar 1972 geh√∂rt Dremmen zu Heinsberg. Since 1 January 1972, Dremmen has belonged to Heinsberg. In October 2007, The centre of Dremmen was redesigned including the church, Sidewalks were widened, roads were made narrower and road connections were changed. Pedestrian areas were decoratively paved and separated by green spaces and small walls on the roadway. There is outdoor seating; the village is also called Piazza. Since 2013, Dremmen has been reconnected to the railway network. =Culture and Sights= Attractions ‚Ä¢ Parish Church of St. Lambertus ‚Ä¢ Marie monastery with Mariengrotte, chapel and park with a fishing pond ‚Ä¢ J√§gerstra√üe with old farmhouses ‚Ä¢ Talm√ºhle ‚Ä¢ Herber Chapel See also List of monuments in Heinsberg Monuments ‚Ä¢ Schuster monument (bronze sculpture) ‚Ä¢ Stele with coat of arms Sch√∂ffengericht Dremmen 1559 ‚Ä¢ Age millstone of the mill Lieck / Heitzer ‚Ä¢ Millstones of the old Talm√ºhle ‚Ä¢ Peace Cross in 1947 ‚Ä¢ Heiligenh√§uschen in the canal (to Boverath) Education At the time of the 17th century education in Dremmen was still strongly associated with the local clergy.

The film was released on September 20, 1935, by 20th Century Fox. Plot Torok, a police captain in Budapest, is pleased when his friend, Count Peter Alvinczy, is elected to the presidency of the government's cabinet. Alvinczy is married to Madalaine, whose first husband, Paul Szegedy, long believed to be dead, turns up and threatens to publicly embarrass Alvinczy by revealing his wife to be already married. Szegedy's mistress and partner in a theatrical act, Katherine Szabo, tries in vain to change his mind, even telling Torok at the police precinct what is occurring. He goes through with the scheme to blackmail Madalaine and is soon found dead by Torok, shot through the heart on the street. Madelaine becomes the prime suspect in Torok's investigation and is placed under arrest. Her husband confesses to the murder, trying to protect her. Torok, however, deduces that Katherine, a sharpshooter in their performing act, picked up a gun in the police station when no one was looking and, through a window, shot her lover. Found out, Katherine kills herself. Torok then releases Madalaine, promising to keep her secret and protect his friend.

History The TSS Duchess of Devonshire was built by Naval and Armament Construction Company of Barrow for the Barrow Steam Navigation Company. She was launched on 21 January 1897 by Louisa Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. She contained four decks - lower, main, promenade and shade. First class accommodation was amidships, with sleeping accommodation for 124 passengers. The promenade deck had fourteen staterooms, a smokeroom and bar, and first-class entrance, with staircase descending to the dining saloon on the main deck. The ladies‚Äô saloon and staterooms were on the lower deck. Her maiden voyage from Barrow to Belfast was on 9 April 1897 under the command of Captain Myerscough, in a journey time of just under six hours. She was sold to the Midland Railway in 1907 In 1914 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and used as an armed boarding vessel. In 1919 she suffered a boiler explosion which killed three people. On 25 September 1922 she was involved in a minor collision with the coasting steamer Trevor which was between Laxey and Douglas. In 1923 she was acquired by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, but in 1928 they sold her to Bland Line in Gibraltar who renamed her Gibel Dersa. She was requisitioned in 1941. In 1943 she was sold to the Dalhousie Steam and Motor Ship Company in London, and in 1947 sold again to A Benjamin and Company of Gibraltar, and scrapped in 1949 at Malaga.

The remains of the image house that originally enclosed it can be seen. Naram-Sin of Akkad, reigned from c. 2254 BC, Qaradagh Mountain, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq Two of the reliefs at the Abu Simbel temples, before relocation A rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on solid or \\"living rock\\" such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. They are a category of rock art, and sometimes found as part of, or in conjunction with, rock-cut architecture.Harman≈üah (2014), 5‚Äì6 However, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric peoples. A few such works exploit the natural contours of the rock and use them to define an image, but they do not amount to man-made reliefs. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures throughout human history, and were especially important in the art of the ancient Near East.Harman≈üah (2014), 5‚Äì6; Canepa, 53 Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be in order to have an impact in the open air. Most of those discussed here have figures that are over life-size, and in many the figures are multiples of life-size. Stylistically they normally relate to other types of sculpture from the culture and period concerned, and except for Hittite and Persian examples they are generally discussed as part of that wider subject.for example by Rawson and Sickman & Soper Reliefs on near-vertical surfaces are most common, but reliefs on essentially horizontal surfaces are also found. The term typically excludes relief carvings inside caves, whether natural or themselves man-made, which are especially found in Indian rock-cut architecture. Natural rock formations made into statues or other sculpture in the round, most famously at the Great Sphinx of Giza, are also usually excluded. Reliefs on large boulders left in their natural location, like the Hittite ƒ∞mamkullu relief, are likely to be included, but smaller boulders may be called stelae or carved orthostats. Many or most ancient reliefs were probably originally painted, over a layer of plaster; in some traces of this remain. The first requirement for a rock relief is a suitable face of stone; a near-vertical cliff minimizes the work required, otherwise a sloping rock face is often cut back to give a vertical area to carve. Most of the ancient Near East was well supplied with hills and mountains offering many cliff faces. An exception was the land of Sumer, where all stone had to be imported over considerable distances, and so the art of Mesopotamia only features rock relief around the edges of the region. The Hittites and ancient Persians were the most prolific makers of rock reliefs in the Near East.Canepa, 53 The form is adopted by some cultures and ignored by others. In the many commemorative stelae of Nahr el-Kalb, 12 kilometres north of Beirut, successive imperial rulers have carved memorials and inscriptions. The Ancient Egyptian, Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian rulers include relief imagery in their monuments, while the Roman and Islamic rulers do not, nor more modern ones (who erect slabs of stone carved elsewhere and fitted to the rock).Harman≈üah (2014a), 95‚Äì96; Kreppner, 372‚Äì373; St. Chad Boscawen, Sir William, full map \\"The Monuments and Inscriptions on the Rocks at Nahr\\", Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arch√¶ology, vol 7, 1882, Longmans, Green, Reader and Dyer, pages 331‚Äì352 Egypt Although prehistoric engraved petroglyphs are common in Egypt, in general the form is not a very common one in Ancient Egyptian art, and only possible in some parts of the country, generally those away from the main centres of population, as Abu Simbel was. There are a group of figures surrounding an image of Mentuhotep II, who died in 2010 BC and was the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom.Callender, in: Ian Shaw (ed), 139, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, 2000, OUP, , 9780191590597 Before they were cut away and moved, the colossal figures outside the Abu Simbel temples were very high reliefs. Other sculpture outside temples cut into the rock qualifies as rock reliefs. The reliefs at Nahr el-Kalb commemorate Rameses II,Harman≈üah (2014a), 95 and are at the furthest reach of his empire (indeed beyond the area he reliably controlled) in modern Lebanon. Hittites and Assyrians The Hittites were important producers of rock reliefs, which form a relatively large part of the few artistic remains they have left.Bonatz The Karabel relief of a king was seen by Herodotus, who mistakenly thought it showed the Egyptian Pharaoh Sesostris.Harman≈üah (2014a), 88‚Äì89; Livius.org on \\"The relief of Sesostris\\" in Herodotos' Histories 2.102‚Äì103, 106 This, like many Hittite reliefs, is near a road, but actually rather hard to see from the road. There are more than a dozen sites, most over 1000 metres in elevation, overlooking plains, and typically near water. These perhaps were placed with an eye to the Hittite's relation to the landscape rather than merely as rulers' propaganda, signs of \\"landscape control\\", or border markers, as has often been thought.Harman≈üah (2014a), 90‚Äì94; Ullmann, Lee Z., in Harman≈üah (2014), Chapter 8; though see also Bonatz They are often at sites with a sacred significance both before and after the Hittite period, and apparently places where the divine world was considered as sometimes breaking through to the human one.Harman≈üah (2014a), 92 Hittite deities at Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya At Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya, just outside the capital of Hattusa, a series of reliefs of Hittite gods in procession decorate open-air \\"chambers\\" made by adding barriers among the natural rock formations. The site was apparently a sanctuary, and possibly a burial site, for the commemoration of the ruling dynasty's ancestors. It was perhaps a private space for the dynasty and a small group of the elite, unlike the more public wayside reliefs. The usual form of these is to show royal males carrying weapons, usually holding a spear, carrying a bow over their shoulder, with a sword at their belt. They have attributes associated with divinity, and so are shown as \\"god-warriors\\".Bonatz The Assyrians probably took the form from the Hittites; the sites chosen for their 49 recorded reliefs often also make little sense if \\"signalling\\" to the general population was the intent, being high and remote, but often near water. The Neo-Assyrians recorded in other places, including metal reliefs on the Balawat Gates showing them being made, the carving of rock reliefs, and it has been suggested that the main intended audience was the gods, the reliefs and the inscriptions that often accompany them being almost of the nature of a \\"business report\\" submitted by the ruler.Kreppner, throughout; 368 for 49 reliefs A canal system built by the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704‚Äì681 BC) to supply water to Nineveh was marked by a number of reliefs showing the king with gods.Kreppner, 371; Malko, Helen, \\"Neo-Assyrian Rock Reliefs: Ideology and Landscapes of an Empire\\", Metropolitan Museum, accessed 28 November 2015 Other reliefs at the Tigris tunnel, a cave in modern Turkey believed to be the source of the river Tigris, are \\"almost inaccessible and invisible for humans\\".Kreppner, 374‚Äì375 Probably built by Sennacherib's son Esarhaddon, Shikaft-e Gulgul is a late example in modern Iran, apparently related to a military campaign.Kreppner, 369‚Äì370; Van der Spek, R.J., \\"The Assyrian Royal Rock Inscription from Shikaft-i Gulgul\\", Iranica Antiqua, vol XII, 1977 Persia The triumph of Shapur I over the Roman Emperor Valerian, and Philip the Arab, Naqsh-e Rustam. Taq Bostan; the \\"knight\\" is probably Khosrow Parviz mounted on Shabdiz The large carved rock relief, typically placed high beside a road, and near a source of water, is a common medium in Persian art, mostly used to glorify the king and proclaim Persian control over territory.Canepa, 53 and throughout. Canepa, 63‚Äì64, 76‚Äì78 on siting It begins with Lullubi and Elamite rock reliefs, such as those at Kul-e Farah and Eshkaft-e Salman in southwest Iran, and continues under the Assyrians. The Behistun relief and inscription, made around 500 BC for Darius the Great, is on a far grander scale, reflecting and proclaiming the power of the Achaemenid empire.Luschey; Canepa, 55‚Äì57 Persian rulers commonly boasted of their power and achievements, until the Muslim conquest removed imagery from such monuments; much later there was a small revival under the Qajar dynasty.Herrmann and Curtis Behistun is unusual in having a large and important inscription, which like the Egyptian Rosetta Stone repeats its text in three different languages, here all using cuneiform script: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian (a later form of Akkadian).Luschey This was important in the modern understanding of these languages. Other Persian reliefs generally lack inscriptions, and the kings involved often can only be tentatively identified. The problem is helped in the case of the Sassanids by their custom of showing a different style of crown for each king, which can be identified from their coins.Herrmann and Curtis Naqsh-e Rustam is the necropolis of the Achaemenid dynasty (500‚Äì330 BC), with four large tombs cut high into the cliff face. These have mainly architectural decoration, but the facades include large panels over the doorways, each very similar in content, with figures of the king being invested by a god, above a zone with rows of smaller figures bearing tribute, with soldiers and officials. The three classes of figures are sharply differentiated in size. The entrance to each tomb is at the centre of each cross, which opens onto a small chamber, where the king lay in a sarcophagus.Cotterell, 162; Canepa, 57‚Äì59, 65‚Äì68 The horizontal beam of each of the tomb's facades is believed to be a replica of the entrance of the palace at Persepolis. Only one has inscriptions and the matching of the other kings to tombs is somewhat speculative; the relief figures are not intended as individualized portraits. The third from the left, identified by an inscription, is the tomb of Darius I the Great (c. 522‚Äì486 BC). The other three are believed to be those of Xerxes I (c. 486‚Äì465 BC), Artaxerxes I (c. 465‚Äì424 BC), and Darius II (c. 423‚Äì404 BC) respectively. A fifth unfinished one might be that of Artaxerxes III, who reigned at the longest two years, but is more likely that of Darius III (c. 336‚Äì330 BC), last of the Achaemenid dynasts. The tombs were looted following the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great. Cotterell, 162; Canepa, 57‚Äì59, 65‚Äì68 Well below the Achaemenid tombs, near ground level, are rock reliefs with large figures of Sassanian kings, some meeting gods, others in combat. The most famous shows the Sassanian king Shapur I on horseback, with the Roman Emperor Valerian bowing to him in submission, and Philip the Arab (an earlier emperor who paid Shapur tribute) holding Shapur's horse, while the dead Emperor Gordian III, killed in battle, lies beneath it (other identifications have been suggested). This commemorates the Battle of Edessa in 260 AD, when Valerian became the only Roman Emperor who was captured as a prisoner of war, a lasting humiliation for the Romans. The placing of these reliefs clearly suggests the Sassanid intention to link themselves with the glories of the earlier Achaemenid Empire.Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 62, 65‚Äì68 There are three further Achaemenid royal tombs with similar reliefs at Persepolis, one unfinished.Vanden Berghe #27‚Äì29 The seven Sassanian reliefs, whose approximate dates range from 225 to 310 AD, show subjects including investiture scenes and battles. The earliest relief at the site is Elamite, from about 1000 BC. About a kilometre away is Naqsh-e Rajab, with a further four Sassanid rock reliefs, three celebrating kings and one a high priest. Another important Sassanid site is Taq Bostan with several reliefs including two royal investitures and a famous figure of a cataphract or Persian heavy cavalryman, about twice life size, probably representing the king Khosrow Parviz mounted on his favourite horse Shabdiz; the pair continued to be celebrated in later Persian literature.Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 74‚Äì76 Firuzabad, Fars and Bishapur have groups of Sassanian reliefs, the former including the oldest, a large battle scene, now badly worn.Herrmann and Curtis At Barm-e Delak a king offers a flower to his queen. Sassanian reliefs are concentrated in the first 80 years of the dynasty, though one important set are 6th-century, and at relatively few sites, mostly in the Sassanid heartland. The later ones in particular suggest that they draw on a now-lost tradition of similar reliefs in palaces in stucco. The rock reliefs were probably coated in plaster and painted.Herrmann and Curtis The rock reliefs of the preceding Persian Seleucids and Parthians are generally smaller and more crude, and not all direct royal commissions as the Sassanid ones clearly were.Canepa, 59‚Äì61, 68‚Äì73 At Behistun an earlier relief including a lion was adapted into a reclining Herakles in a fully Hellenistic style; he reclines on a lion skin. This was only uncovered below rubble relatively recently; an inscription dates it to 148 BC.Downey; Canepa, 59‚Äì60 Other reliefs in Iran include the Assyrian king in shallow relief at Shikaft-e Gulgul; not all sites with Persian reliefs are in modern Iran.Herrmann and Curtis Qajar reliefs include a large and lively panel showing hunting at the royal hunting-ground of Tangeh Savashi, and a panel, still largely with its colouring intact, at Taq Bostan showing the shah seated with attendants. The standard catalogue of pre-Islamic Persian reliefs lists the known examples (as at 1984) as follows: Lullubi #1‚Äì4; Elam #5‚Äì19; Assyrian #20‚Äì21; Achaemenid #22‚Äì30; Late/Post-Achaemenid and Seleucid #31‚Äì35; Parthian #36‚Äì49; Sasanian #50‚Äì84; others #85‚Äì88.Vanden Berghe, Louis, Reliefs rupestres de l' Iran ancien, 1983, Brussels, per online summary of his list here India Unakoti group of reliefs of Shiva, Tripura, India, 11th century Although carving into solid rock is more a feature of Indian sculpture than of any other culture, most Indian sculptures fall outside the strict definition of rock reliefs because they are either fully detached statues, or are reliefs within rock-cut or natural caves, or temples entirely cut from the living rock. In the former group are many colossal Jain figures of tirthankara, and in the later Hindu and Buddhist works at the Elephanta Caves, Ajanta Caves, Ellora, the Aurangabad Caves, and most of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram.Harle, chapters 9 and 10 Especially at Ajanta, there are many rock reliefs in the open, around the entrances to the caves, either part of the original designs or votive sculptures added later by individual patrons.Spink, 5‚Äì6 However, there are a number of significant rock reliefs in India, with the Descent of the Ganges at Mahabalipuram the best known and perhaps the most impressive. This is a large 7th-century Hindu scene with many figures that uses the form of the rock to shape the image.Harle, 278-83 The Anantashayi Vishnu is an early 9th-century horizontal relief of the reclining Hindu god Vishnu in Orissa, measuring in length, cut into a flat bed of rock. while the largest standing image is the Gommateshwara statue in Southern India. At Unakoti, Tripura there is an 11th-century group of reliefs related to Shiva, and at Hampi scenes from the Ramayana. Several sites, such as Kalugumalai and the Samanar Hills in Tamil Nadu, have Jain reliefs, mostly of meditating tirthankaras.

The colossal Buddha figures are nearly all in very high relief, only still attached to the rock face at the rear. Several have or had \\"image houses\\", or buildings enclosing them, which meant that they could normally only be seen very close up, and the impressive view from further back was lost to pilgrims. In Sri Lanka colossal Buddha figures include the Avukana Buddha statue, 5th century and almost free-standing, with only a narrow strip at the back still connecting it to the cliff, and the four 12-century Buddha figures at Gal Vihara; the brick foundations for image houses can be seen here. The seven 10th-century figures at Buduruvagala are in much lower relief. There are very lively elephants carved around a temple pool at Isurumuniya.Harle, 450‚Äì456 Of the colossal lion gateway to the hill-palace at Sigiriya, only the paws remain, the head having fallen off at some point. The three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites in China are the Mogao Caves,Rawson, 319. The rock at Dunhuang is a weak \\"gravel conglomerate\\", and the sculptures are finished in clay, with smaller ones being entirely clay. Longmen Grottoes (672‚Äì673 for the main group) and Yungang Grottoes (460‚Äì535), all of which have colossal Buddha statues in very high relief, cut back into huge niches in the cliff,Rawson, 320‚Äì322 though the largest figure at Mogao is still enclosed by a wooden image house superstructure in front of it; this is also thought to be a portrait of the reigning empress Wu Zetian. One of the Longmen figures is effectively in a man-made cave, but can be seen from outside through a large window opened in the outer face (see gallery). Smaller rock-cut sculptures and paintings decorate the cave temples at these sites. The Tang dynasty Leshan Giant Buddha, the largest of all, was built with a superstructure covering it, which was destroyed by the Mongols. Such large figures were a novelty in Chinese art, and adapted conventions from further west.Rawson, 151‚Äì154; Sickman & Soper, 87‚Äì95, 144‚Äì147 The Dazu Rock Carvings include scenes with unusually large numbers of figures, such as a famous and large scene of the Buddhist Judgement of Souls. These are set back into the cliff and the shelter has enabled them to retain their bright colours.Rawson, 322; UNESCO, World Heritage List \\"Dazu Rock Carvings\\", accessed 27 November 2015 Other Chinese Buddhist cave sites with external rock reliefs include Lingyin Temple with many small reliefs, and the Maijishan Grottoes with a main colossal group;Rawson, 319 unusually for figures of such a size, they are in bas- relief. The Bamiyan Buddha figures were two standing Buddha figures of the 6th century in Afghanistan which were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001; they probably were one of the immediate influences on the Chinese sites further east on the Silk Road.Sickman & Soper, 87; this conventional view may not be correct, see Rawson, 318 In Japan the Nihon-ji temple includes a colossal seated Buddha completed in 1783, 31 metres tall. Japanese \\"Great Buddha\\" statues are called \\"daibutsu\\", but most are in bronze. Sites elsewhere include Kbal Spean near Angkor in Cambodia, which has both Hindu and Buddhist reliefs. These are placed in rocky shallows of the river, with water flowing over them. Large numbers of short lingams and deities were intended to purify the water that flowed over them on its way to the city.Jessup, 122‚Äì123 File:Buda de Avukana - 03.jpgAvukana Buddha statue, Sri Lanka, 5th century File:Buddha Bamiyan 1963.jpgThe larger of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in 1963, before it was destroyed File:Longmen lu she na.jpgPart of the Longmen Grottos File:China - Yungang Grottoes 5 (135940211).jpgNo 5 at the Yungang Grottoes File:Majishan huge sculptures 20090226.jpgDetail of the colossal group at the Maijishan Grottoes File:Kbal Spean - 018 Vishnu with Lingas near the Bridge (8584753052).jpgKbal Spean, Vishnu and lingams File:Dazu rock carvings baoding 18 layers of hell.JPGDetails of part of the Dazu rock carvings File:Nihonji daibutsu.jpgThe Nihon-ji daibutsu, 1783 Greek and Roman world Madara Rider in Bulgaria, cut around 700 The Hellenistic Athena relief of S√∂mek in modern Turkey, with a warrior nearby, are two of the relatively few examples from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.Serra Durug√∂n√ºl: Die Felsreliefs im Rauhen Kilikien.

Nearby at Adamkayalar there are a series of standing figures in classical niches, probably funerary memorials of the 2nd century AD; similar figures are found at Kanlidivane. All these sites are from former Hittite and Neo-Hittite territories. The cliff at Behistun, as well as Darius's famous relief, has a Seleucid reclining Hercules of 148 BC with a Greek inscription.Downey Also from the fringes of the Roman world, the famous rock-cut tombs of Petra, Jordan include figurative elements, mostly now battered by iconoclasm, for example the best-known tomb, known as The Treasury.Rawson, Jessica, Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon, 1984, pp. 43‚Äì44, British Museum Publications, Medieval Europe Standing alone in early medieval Europe is the Madara Rider in Bulgaria, cut around 700 above the palace of a ruler of the Bulgars. It shows a rider, about double life- size, spearing a lion, with a dog running behind him.UNESCO, World Heritage Sites List, \\"Madara Rider\\" Though the medium of rock relief is without parallels anywhere near, this motif, known as the Thracian horseman, had long been common on stelae in the region, and such motifs appear in metalwork,Lovata, Troy R, Olton, Elizabeth (eds), Understanding Graffiti: Multidisciplinary Studies from Prehistory to the Present, 83‚Äì85, 2015, Left Coast Press, , 9781611328684 such as the ewer with a mounted warrior and his prisoner in the enigmatic Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s, and are common in Sasanian silver bowls, which may well have been traded as far as the Balkans. The (probably) 12th-century Externsteine relief in southern Germany measures 4.8 m high by 3.7 m wide. It shows the Descent from the Cross of Jesus, a standard scene from Christian art, with a total of ten figures. The circumstances of its making remain unclear, and despite the extensive tradition of medieval reliefs on buildings, making them on natural rock formations at a large size remained very rare. Americas The Inca Sayhuite Stone Pre-Columbian rock reliefs, mostly using a low relief, include those at Chalcatzingo in Mexico, probably from around 900‚Äì700 BC. These reflect Olmec style, though the city was controlled by local rulers. They are on vertical cliff faces, and comparable in style and subject matter to stelae and architectural reliefs in the same tradition.\\"Monument 1: Relief of \\"El Rey\\" (The King)\\", and Chalcatzingo index page; \\"Art 447H. Mesoamerican. Olmec\\", Cal State The Inca tradition is very distinctive; they carved rock with mainly horizontal representations of landscapes as one form of huaca; the most famous are the Sayhuite Stone and the Quinku rock. These show a landscape, but also many animals; it is not clear if the landscapes represent a real place or are imaginary. These permanent works formed part of a wider Inca tradition of visualizing and modelling landscapes, often accompanied by rituals.Gartner, William Gustav, \\"Mapmaking in the Central Andes\\" PDF, pp. 285‚Äì289 Modern Modern rock reliefs tend to be colossal, at several times life-size, and are usually memorials of some sort. In America, Mount Rushmore is mostly in a very high relief, and the Stone Mountain relief commemorating three Confederate generals in bas-relief.

Produced by Buzz Potamkin and directed by Mordicai Gerstein and Al Kouzel, the program made its debut on NBC on November 20, 1980.Shaw, Jane. \\"Christmas tree is focus of Berenstain Bears' newest adventure.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 1980-12-02, p. 32. The television special inspired a book, The Berenstain Bears' Thanksgiving, published by Scholastic in 1997. Development Stan and Jan Berenstain's first animated holiday special aired on NBC in December 1979. The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree was the first of five annual animated specials that would air on NBC, produced by Joe Cates and the Joseph Cates Production Company. The Berenstain Bears Meet Bigpaw was the second in this series. The Berenstains utilized rhyming couplets in the script - for both the narrator and the character dialogue. This element had also been used in the Christmas Tree special and was familiar to audiences since a similar type of writing was used in the Berenstain Bears Beginner Books series. The special is officially the first appearance of the Bigpaw character in the Berenstain Bears series. A precursor to Bigpaw, Great Natural Bear, appeared in The Bears' Almanac in 1973 and is the basis on which Bigpaw was developed. Bigpaw appears in several subsequent books and in the CBS cartoon series. Production and casting The 25-minute special was created and written by Stan and Jan Berenstain and featured original music composed and conducted by Emmy-winning musician Elliot Lawrence, with lyrics provided by Stan Berenstain. The score included three original songs: \\"Thankfulness,\\" \\"Bigpaw,\\" and \\"A Stranger's Just Somebody (You Don't Already Know).\\" The special starred Ron McLarty, Gabriela Glatzer, Jonathan Lewis, and Pat Lysinger as Papa, Sister, Brother, and Mama Bear, respectively. McLarty also doubled as the show's narrator. All four actors were reprising their vocal roles from The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree. Bob Kaliban was the voice of Bigpaw. It was the second of five Berenstain Bears animated specials that aired on NBC from 1979 to 1983. Premiere The program premiered on NBC on Thursday, November 20, 1980 at 8:30PM ET. Its lead-in was Daffy Duck's Thanks- for-Giving Special and it competed against The Waltons on CBS and NFL football on ABC. The special was sponsored by Kellogg's. Plot VHS editions of Bigpaw. The special was originally released by Embassy Home Entertainment (1987) and then by Kids Klassics (1989). The special has also been made available on LaserDisc and DVD. Thanksgiving is approaching in Bear Country. The Bear Family attempt to discern their fortunes by reading the harvest honeycomb when an ominous footprint appears in the bottom of the pan. Mama interprets this as a sign that the Thanksgiving Legend of Bigpaw is coming to pass. According to this legend, Mama states and warns the cubs that if the bears were selfish, greedy and unkind to the needy and do not share in the bounties of nature, Bigpaw will come and gobble up Bear Country county by county. Papa believes the story to be nonsense. Papa considers himself a bear \\"for all seasons\\", telling the cubs how he takes care of the Earth and all of its creatures year round - and especially on days like Easter, Christmas, and Arbor Day. But when it comes to Thanksgiving, Papa seems to care more about eating a feast than giving thanks. Meanwhile, Mama continues the Thanksgiving preparations at home (\\"Thankfulness\\"). While visiting a pumpkin patch, Papa learns that his selfishness debt that the legend of the terrifying Bigpaw is real and is on the move through Sinister Bog. On their own, Brother and Sister decide to go and gather (no ifs, ands, or buts) mixed nuts for Papa. They set off into the woods and into Sinister Bog. Gathering nuts in a tree, Brother and Sister feel the earth trembling as Bigpaw approaches (\\"Bigpaw\\"). Terrified, the cubs lose their balance, and begin to fall from the tree. They are saved from injury, though, by landing in the enormous hand of Bigpaw. Instead of hurting them, Bigpaw gently places them safely upon the ground and the cubs immediately realize that Bigpaw is not a creature to fear. Meanwhile, back at the village square, Papa has gathered members of Bear Country, rallying a group of citizens to seek out Bigpaw and \\"get him before he gets us\\". Mama thinks the bears are getting carried away and convinces them to use their heads and think things through (\\"A Stranger's Just Somebody (You Don't Already Know)\\"). Bigpaw has climbed a high mountain to take a nap and his yawn echoes through the valley. But the fearful bears interpret his yawn as a terrifying roar and Papa - seeing Bigpaw's giant shadow - assembles a mob. Brother and Sister try to tell Papa of Bigpaw's kindness, but he doesn't listen. Up on the mountain, Bigpaw was setting in for his nap when he heard the sound of the angry mob approaching. Afraid of the approaching bears, Bigpaw built a tall stack of boulders to use as weapons against the approaching mob until Sister and Brother intervene, placing themselves between Bigpaw and the angry members of Bear Country. Bigpaw holds back his tower of rock, gently picks up Brother and SIster, who explain how kind the giant is. Everyone celebrates and the Bear Family invites Bigpaw to Thanksgiving dinner the following day, at which time Bigpaw presents Papa with his favorite treat - mixed nuts (\\"Thankfulness - Reprise\\"). Book adaptation Cover of storybook version of \\"Meet Bigpaw,\\" entitled \\"The Berenstain Bears' Thanksgiving,\\" published by Scholastic (1997).A storybook version of the film was published by Scholastic in 1997 under the title The Berenstain Bears' Thanksgiving. The book closely follows the plot of the television special. As of August 2016, the book is out of print but can be easily found on the secondhand market. The Berenstain Bear Scouts Meet Bigpaw (1995) has a similar plot. Home media releases In 1984, Embassy Home Entertainment released the special on LaserDisc as a double-feature with The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree, called \\"A Berenstain Bears Celebration.\\" In 1987, the special was made available on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment as part of their Children's Treasures series. In 1989, the special was distributed on VHS by Kids Klassics. The special was re-released in 1992 by GoodTimes Home Video, in a double-feature with The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree. In 2002, the special was released on DVD by GoodTimes, also in a double-feature with The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree. This is the only Berenstain Bears special that was never required with the 1980s TV series by Sony Wonder possibly due to a scene in which a lone hedgehog explains about Big Paw as he smoked a cigar briefly during the explanation.

In 1984, the company headquarters in D N Road, Mumbai (near Fort) was engulfed by fire. In 1984, the company was acquired by the Khataus after which it got the present name. The company used to manufacture canvas and rubber footwear. It had its manufacturing facilities in Mumbai (Jogeshwari), Aurangabad and Ahmedabad. In 1989, the company entered into a technical agreement with Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport, Germany, to manufacture sports and special application shoes. It came out with a public issue in June 1989 to set up a unit in Aurangabad to manufacture sports shoes. In 1995, there was a reshuffle in the management because of a split in the Khatau family. In addition to the labor problem, the company was also not able to cope up with the competition from the unorganised sector for its lower segment products like canvas and rubber footwear. The company was incurring losses. Hence, in 1995, it disposed of its Jogeshwari plant where operations had been partially suspended since March 1994. Around 800 of its 1200 workers were retrenched through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The company renewed its agreement for five years with Puma in 1995. During the year 1999, the company was registered as a sick company under SICA 1985 and BIFR appointed Bank of India as its operating agency to expedite the preparation of the Draft of Rehabilitation Scheme (with inputs from India Infoline). In its prime, Carona was a heritage brand of India and the second largest footwear company in India. Carona was a brand which thrived during the license control regime in India. The brand thrived along with Bata. In fact, Carona fought head on with the market leader Bata. The shops and the products were extremely similar. When Bata launched one style, Carona quickly followed suit. Both Bata and Carona were instrumental in popularizing canvas shoes in India. These shoes were a rage among kids at that time. In the nineties, new brands began to enter the market with new designs and fashion. Foreign brands like Nike, Reebok and Adidas began to market their products aggressively which further worsened the position of Carona. Bata had the backing of its foreign parent which helped it work through the restructuring exercise, but Carona did not have that backing. Bata was able to sustain itself by launching new models at affordable prices, while Carona was not able to meet the market with new launches. Both Bata and Carona had own showrooms which became expensive to maintain. Carona went in to the BIFR fold in 1998.

Suresh Chavhanke was born on 18 February 1972 in Shirdi, Maharashtra, India. He is the anchor of TV show bindas Bol. He has been accused of inciting communal violence in the past and was arrested by Lucknow police once for 2 days before getting bail.  Early Life and Career  Suresh Chavhanke claims to be a member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh since the age of 3 years when he started attending its ceremonies. As a member of RSS, he had worked as a reporter of pro-RSS newspaper Tarun Bharat. He held several posts in RSS before becoming a full- time reporter. He launched Sudarshan News channel in 2005 in Pune and later shifted it to Noida. He is currently the chairman, managing director and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan news. He hosts the show Bindas Bol.  Controversies  * An FIR was lodged with Noida Police against Suresh Chavhanke for allegedly raping a former employee of his channel Sudarshan News in November 2016. He was booked by Police under 11 sections of the IPC; police had investigated the case but the charges were not substantiated as per the closure report filed by the Police in January 2017. Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, convener of the Akhil Bhartiya Sant Parishad, alleged that complainant was under influence of Jihadist elements and claimed that they have solid proofs but can't disclose to media. Several organisations alleged that he was victimised because he stood up for 'Hindu cause'. * In April 2017, Chavhanke was booked and later arrested for inciting communal hatred between the two communities. The residents of Uttar Pradesh had registered a complaint against Sudarshan News‚Äô show ‚ÄòBindaas Bol‚Äô, hosted by Chavhanke and had alleged that it aired programmes that promoted communal disharmony and hostility between religious groups. Subsequently, Chavhanke was booked under various IPC sections and section 16 of the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1955 was also invoked. After being released on bail, he claimed that it was an attempt to \\"suppress and intimidate media\\". * In 2018, he started a Bharat Bachav rally allegedly to give a message on population control. The rally was interrupted by Hyderabad Police citing law and order problems created by the event. Later, yatra was continued by assurance of T.

He was a Carmichael Professor of Ancient Indian History and Culture at Calcutta University and is reported to have deciphered many ancient scripts. He was the author of 50 books and over 700 articles on ancient history, numismatics and epigraphy. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992.  Early life and education  Brahmi script on Ashoka Pillar, Sarnath. B. N. Mukherjee was born on the New Year's Day of 1932. He obtained his master's degree in Ancient Indian History and Culture from Calcutta University, learning under Sarasi Kumar Saraswati, J. N. Banerjee and R. G. Basak and did research under the guidance of Arthur Llewellyn Basham, renowned scholar and historian, to secure a doctoral degree from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. He continued in UK at Cambridge University to research under Harold Walter Bailey on historical linguistics of West and Central Asia, focusing on Iranian, Saka, Saka‚ÄìKhotanese and Aramaic studies.  Scholarship  Mukherjee wrote several books on the epigraphy and iconography of the central Asia, such as the Kushans and Yuezhis. His 1989 book, The Rise and Fall of the Kushanas, India in Early Central Asia (1996) and the last of his works, Kushana Studies, New Perspectives, released in 2004, account his observations on these topics. His exploration of Ancient India led him to numismatic studies and he wrote two books on the subject, namely Numismatic Art of India and Coins of Bengal. Three of his books, The Kushana Genealogy and Chronology (1967), An Agrippan Source: Studies in Indo- Parthian History (1969) and Kushana Coins in the Land of Five Rivers (1978), employ the study of coins as a means of reconstructing the political and dynastic histories of Saka-Kushana eras. Known to be a scholar of Aramaic and Greek edicts, he elucidated the edicts of Asoka which assisted in the study of the Maurya empire. He asserted that these edicts were translations and transliterations of Prakrit inscriptions and revealed the political intonations of Ashoka's policy of Dhamma. His findings were published in a book, Studies in the Aramaic Edicts of Asoka (1984). Mukherjee wrote a 300-page commentary on the treatise, Political History of Ancient India: From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of the Gupta Dynasty, considered to be a classic text on ancient India, written by Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri. His studies helped in the understanding of Brahmi and Kharoshti scripts and their etymologies. His style of writing was heavily leaned on to footnotes and his findings have, at times, attracted criticisms. Besides 50 books, he also published over 700 articles in various national and international journals.  Honours  Mukherjee was a professor at Calcutta University and held the Carmichael chair of the Ancient Indian History and Culture from 1975 to 1998. He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, UK. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992. He was the president of the Indian History Congress and was a recipient of the H. C. Raychaudhuri Centenary Medal of the Asiatic Society, Kolkata. Mukherjee died on 4 April 2013, at the age of 79, survived by his wife and son.

Ancient grains are often marketed as being more nutritious than modern grains, though their health benefits have been disputed by some nutritionists. Ancient grains include varieties of wheat: spelt, Khorasan wheat (Kamut), farro, einkorn, and emmer; the grains millet, barley, teff, oats, and sorghum; and the pseudocereals quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and chia. Some authors even consider bulgur and freekeh to be ancient grains,Charlie Fox, Freekeh Recipes: A Guide to Cooking with this Ancient Grain, 2020 even though they are usually made from ordinary wheat. Modern wheat is a hybrid descendant of three wheat species considered to be ancient grains: spelt, einkorn, and emmer. History The origin of grains goes back to the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago, when prehistoric communities started to make the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer. Modern varieties of grains have been developed over time through mutation, selective cropping, breeding and research in biotechnology. Ancient grains, however, are said to be largely unchanged from their initial domesticated varieties. Various forms of archaeobotanical evidence, such as carbonized and semicarbonizeed grains, coprolites and imprints of grains, husks or spikelets on potsherds, have been found during excavations of Neolithic sites. Ancient grains played a role in the spiritual life of several ancient civilizations, from the Aztecs to the Greeks and Egyptians. Quinoa was called the \\"mother of all grains\\" and considered sacred by the Inca people. Amaranth was likewise considered sacred by the Aztecs, and was used as part of a religious ceremony, its cultivation being banned by Spanish colonial authorities. Farro grains are mentioned in the Old Testament. The first reference to ancient grains as a health food was in Daily News (New York) in 1996. Since then the popularity of ancient grains as a food has increased, and in 2011 the gluten-free food market was valued at $1.6 bn. Types =Wheat= Archaeobotanical studies indicate three species of wheat existed in the distant past. These are Triticum sphaeococcum Pers, Triticum vulgare Vill and Triticum compactum. The first two hexaploid species are still cultivated in modern times, mostly in Northern India. The diploid species einkorn and tetraploid species emmer are early wheat species. Evidence for them dates to the Bus Mordeh phase (7500 BC to 6500 BC) recovered from excavation at Ali Kosh in Iran and somewhat later evidence from Nea Nikomedeia. Triticum durum Desf may once have been cultivated in Ancient Egypt. Some grains found in India are: *Triticum sphaerococcum Pers. - also called \\"Indian Short Wheat\\", this is the earliest known cultivated wheat from India with evidence from the Chalcolithic site Harappa and the later site Ter *Triticum sulgare Vill. - also called \\"Bread wheat\\" evidence has been found at Chanhudaro, Mohenjodaro and Navdatolo *Triticum compactum - found at Harappa, Mundigak and Mohenjodaro *Triticum Sp. - found at Navdaroli, Inamgaon, Atranjikhera and Kayatha *Triticum Sp. Contd. - found at Songaon, Rohtak, Nevasa and Bhokardan =Barley= Along with wheat, barley (hordeum) is one of the earliest cultivated crops. It was commonly cultivated throughout the Near East and Southern Europe in its hulled form, and the domesticated two row species may have originated at Beidha, Jarmo, or Ali Kosh. Hordeum spontanneum Koch was found at √áatal H√ºy√ºk (5850 BCE - 5600 BCE) and Hordeum distichum Linn at Ali Kosh (6750 BCE - 6000 BCE). In India it was mostly cultivated in the north and central regions, extending only as far south as Inamgaon and Nevasa. =Rice= Rice is believed to have been cultivated at Non Nok Tha in Thailand since 3500 BC where impressions of grains of rice have been found on potsherds. Other cultivation sites include the Neolithic sites of Yang-Shao Ts'uan, Liu Tzuchen, Anhui, Kionsi, Chekiang and Hupei. =Millet= The origin of finger millet (also called ragi) is debated with various proposals placing it at Abyssinia, Africa or India. Charred grains of cultivated and wild ragi have been found at the Neolithic site Hallur in southern India. Wild ragi (eleusine indica Gaertn) is known only from Songaon and Bhokardan, while the cultivated form appears at Paiyampalli in Tamilnadu, Songaon and later at Bhokardan and Nevasa in Maharashtra. Cultivation of pearl millet is known from sites with semi-arid climate, occurring at Hallur, Rangpur and Nevasa. Cultivation of pearl millet in modern India (where it is also called bajra) is mostly limited to the country's semi-arid regions. In Africa evidence has been found dating to the Naghez phase, but it is not known whether these were cultivated. Both wild and cultivated grain impressions were found at Le Baidla I. Charred grains of paspalum scrobiculatum (Kodo millet), dating to the Satavahana period, have been found at Nevasa. Sorghum vulgare is known from semi-arid parts of Rajasthan and Maharashtra like Inamgaon, Paunar and Ahar. Nutritional claims Proponents of ancient grains say that they are rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Some nutritionists state that they are not inherently more healthy than modern grains, and that ancient and modern grains have similar health benefits when eaten as whole grains. This has led to criticism of the grouping as unscientific and driven by marketing. Some, but not all, ancient grains are gluten-free. Amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, millet, and teff are gluten-free, but oats and the ancient kinds of wheat (including spelt, einkorn, and Khorasan wheat) are not.

Two other members of his family featured among the list of officers. A small unit, it was attached to the larger 1st Middlesex EVC in 1863, and was disbanded in 1871. There were no other engineer volunteers in the county of Essex for over 30 years.Beckett, Appendix IX.Westlake, p. 7Quarterly Army List January 1866.Edward Hammond Bentall at Grace's Guide.E.H. Bentall & Co at Grace's Guide. Territorial Force When the Territorial Force (TF) was created by the Haldane Reforms in 1908, a new unit was formed at Chelmsford under the title Essex (Fortress) Royal Engineers. Its nucleus came from personnel of the former Electrical Engineers Volunteer Corps, of which there had been a Detachment raised from the Crompton Electrical Works in Chelmsford, under the leadership of its managing director, R. E. B. Crompton. The Essex Fortress RE consisted of a single Company, No.1 Essex Electric Lights Company, RE (TF), which had its headquarters at Bank Chambers, New Street, Chelmsford. In 1909, it moved to 19 Broomfield Road, Chelmsford, and finally in 1911 to the newly opened Drill Hall in Market Road, Chelmsford, which it shared with the Essex Royal Horse Artillery, 5th Battalion Essex Regiment and other local TF units.Quarterly Army List, January 1909.Monthly Army List, August 1914.Chelmsford at The Drill Hall Project.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 12. World War I On the outbreak of World War I, the fortress engineers were mobilised and the Essex company moved into its war station in the Harwich Coast Defences. A second Company was formed as a Reserve unit in October 1914, comprising men from the pre-war Company who had not signed to undertake \\"Imperial Service\\" overseas if required, and the original Company was brought up to strength with new recruits. In January 1915 the Companies were retitled as 1/1st Essex (Fortress) Company (Electric Lights), RE (TF) and 2/1st Essex (Fortress) Company (Electric Lights), RE (TF); as it transpired neither unit served overseas and both remained on home service at Harwich, providing searchlights for the Eastern Coast Fixed Defences at Harwich Redoubt and Landguard Fort, Felixstowe. In October 1918, coastal defence units in the U.K. were extensively reorganised and the two Essex (Fortress) Electric Lights Companies amalgamated to form 601st (Harwich) Fortress Company, RE (TF). As well as searchlight detachments, the Company included a Fortress Signal Section, providing the communications for the various defences around the Port.Conrad.Fortress Companies RE at Long, Long Trail. As well as operating searchlights for the coastal defence guns, the RE fortress companies began to use them in the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role as the war progressed and raids by airships and fixed wing bombers on the East Coast became more frequent.Morris, pp 178‚Äì85. As a naval base, Harwich was a tempting target and, although the town was darkened, German aircrews could still recognise it from harbour lights and the outline of the power station and railway.Morris, p. 50. By mid-1917, Harwich AA Defence Command (AADC) was allocated No 9 Mobile Searchlight Company, RE (manned by the Tyne Electrical Engineers and as the system became more sophisticated in 1918 the RE searchlight detachments were assigned directly to AA gun batteries of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and Harwich AADC had No 8 AA Battery, forming part of the London Air Defence Area. In addition, drafts of personnel from the Essex (Fortress) RE were formed into two other units in late 1916, No.43 (Essex) Anti-Aircraft Company, RE (TF), which served at Harwich, and No.44 (Essex) Anti-Aircraft Company, RE (TF), which served on anti-aircraft duties at the Royal Naval Air Station at Pulham Market in Norfolk. Both these units were disbanded in December 1917 upon the reorganisation of anti-aircraft defences in the U.K. To provide a Headquarters and Depot for the various units, The Essex (Fortress) RE (TF) Administrative Centre had opened at the Market Road Drill Hall, Chelmsford in September 1915. New recruits were processed through this centre, which also acted as a holding Depot, with a small staff of Officers and N.C.Os. In August 1916, the Administrative Centre was merged into No.3 Territorial Force Depot, Eastern Command, which remained at Market Road but in late 1917 the Essex (F) RE portion of this Depot were transferred to a new Royal Engineers (Territorial Force) Depot, opened at Gillingham as a base for all RE (TF) units. By this stage of the war, most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from the coastal and AA defences to be sent to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western FrontShort et al, pp. 128, 139, 143, 151. Thus many men of the Essex (Fortress) RE (TF) found themselves posted to other Royal Engineers units. All TF units were demobilised in 1919 after the Armistice with Germany. Interwar Cap badge of the Royal Engineers (cipher of King George VI) The Essex (Fortress) Royal Engineers (TF) was reconstituted along with the rest of the Territorial Force in February 1920, and once again consisted of a single Company, to be now known as No 1 Essex Company (Electric Lights and Works), RE (TF), raised at Market Road, Chelmsford. It was attached to 54th (East Anglian) Division (TF) in peacetime, but its wartime role remained as part of the Harwich defences. The Company included both searchlight (Electric Lights) Sections and a Works Section, the latter to build and maintain the defences. In addition, the Harwich (Fortress) Signal Section, RE (TF) was to be formed, to provide and maintain the telephone and wireless communications for the Harwich Defences. This latter Section transferred to the Royal Corps of Signals in August 1920 and ceased to form part of the Essex (Fortress) RE.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 104.Monthly Army List, various dates. In October 1921, the Territorial Force was renamed as The Territorial Army and the Essex (Fortress) RE changed its title to No.1 (Essex) Electric Lights Company, RE (TF), relinquishing the Works role. Whilst retaining its headquarters at Chelmsford, a section was opened at the Drill Hall, Brooke Road, Grays in 1923, which recruited from the Grays and Wickford districts.Titles and Designations, 1927. During the 1930s, the increasing need for AA defences was recognised, and the Essex Fortress Engineers company was assigned a new anti-aircraft role for the Port of Harwich, being redesignated as No.1 (Essex) Anti-Aircraft Searchlight Company, RE (TA) in 1932. Its place in the Harwich coast defences was taken in 1936 by a newly formed unit, the Suffolk (Fortress) RE (TA), which raised an Electric Lights and Works Company at Ipswich. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth After the Munich Crisis, Britain's AA defences were rapidly expanded as part of the TA's new Anti-Aircraft Command and by May 1939 the Essex Fortress Engineers had been incorporated into a new unit designated 74th (Essex Fortress) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE, organised as:Frederick, pp. 858‚Äì62, 873.Monthly Army List, May 1939.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 111‚Äì3. * HQ at a new drill hall at Tottenham High RoadOsborne, pp. 134‚Äì6. * 310 (Essex) AA Company at Epping ‚Äì transferred from 28th (Essex) AA Bn * 335 AA Company at Tottenham ‚Äì transferred from 33rd (St Pancras) AA Bn * 469 AA Company at Market Road, Chelmsford, less two Sections raised at the Drill Hall, Fairfield Road, Braintree, the Grays Sections having transferred in late 1938 to 2/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment (65th Searchlight Regiment) (TA) ‚Äì former 1 AA Company, Essex Fortress Engineers World War II =Mobilisation= In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 74th AA Battalion established its HQ at Springfield House, Hatfield Peverel.29 AA Brigade War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2250. The unit was subordinated to 29th (East Anglian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 6th Anti- Aircraft Division, which was responsible for the air defence of the Thames Estuary, Essex and north Kent.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, p. 371, Table LX, p. 378. =Phoney War= In the Spring of 1940, 6th AA Division reorganised its growing AA defences. As a result, 29 AA Brigade took on responsibility from 37 AA Bde for the Gun Defence Area (GDA) at Harwich and Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields including North Weald and Debden. In May, the first, very secret, Searchlight Control (SLC) radar sets began to appear, with one being stationed at Landguard Fort to replace the old sound-locator at the S/L site operated by 469 AA Co.Routledge pp 96‚Äì9. =Battle of Britain= Cap badge of the Royal Artillery (pre-1953. The Phoney War ended with the German invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940. Home Forces became concerned about the threat from German paratroopers and AA Command's units were given anti-invasion roles. A plan to attach groups of riflemen from the infantry training centres to 6 AA Division's widely spaced S/L sites foundered on the lack of men. Instead, the S/L detachments themselves were given the responsibility for attacking parachutists before they could organise, and spare men at company HQs were formed into mobile columns using requisitioned civilian transport to hunt them down. 74th AA Battalion drew extra rifles and ammunition from Warley Ordnance Store. On 1 August 1940, the RE's AA battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA), which designated them Searchlight Regiments, and the companies became batteries.Litchfield, p. 174.74 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Farndale, Annex M, p. 340. During the Battle of Britain, the subsequent London Blitz, on into 1941, the regiment remained part of 29 AA Bde covering Harwich and East Anglia. Its searchlights had a dual role in assisting both the guns of AA Command and the night fighters of RAF Fighter Command.6 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45. Routledge, p. 388.Farndale, Annex D, p. 258; Annex H. p. 286. =The Blitz= Formation sign of 6 Anti-Aircraft Division, worn until December 1941. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of 3500 yards, but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to 6000 yards by the time the Luftwaffe began its night Blitz in September 1940. In November, this was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or RAF Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with searchlight control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 93. 73rd S/L Regiment served in 29 AA Bde in East Anglia throughout the Blitz.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 236th S/L Training Rgt at Oswestry where it provided the basis for a new 559 S/L Bty formed on 13 February 1941. This battery later joined 66th (Gloucesters) S/L Rgt. =Mid-war= AA Radar No 2. By October 1941, the availability of SLC radar was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 10,400-yard intervals in 'Indicator Belts' along the coast and 'Killer Belts' at 6000-yard spacing inland to cooperate with night fighters.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì400; Map 35. Formation sign of 8 Anti-Aircraft Division, worn until October 1942. During December 1941, the regiment moved to 60 AA Bde in 8 AA Division covering Exeter, Yeovil and Portland Harbour.29 AA Brigade War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/2251.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. Early in 1942, the Luftwaffe began a new wave of attacks on British cities (the Baedeker Blitz):in 8 AA Division's area Exeter and undefended Bath were hit in March, April and May, and Weston-super-Mare in June.Routledge, pp. 400‚Äì4.Collier, Chapter 20.Collier, Appendix XXXVII. The main threat along the South Coast of England during the summer of 1942 was from low level daylight 'hit and run' raids by single-engined Luftwaffe aircraft, which were difficult for AA guns to engage but provided targets of opportunity for the Light machine guns with which S/L sites were equipped. There was a shake-up of AA Command at the beginning of October 1942, when the AA Divisions were replaced by AA Groups having a wider remit. 60 AA Brigade and 74th S/L Rgt came under 3 AA Group.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84. =Infantry role= By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. At the same time, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. The War Office began to reorganise surplus AA regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for front-line service.Ellis, p. 369. 74th (Essex Fortress) was one of the searchlight regiments selected for conversion, reorganising in the infantry role as 74th (Essex Fortress) Garrison Regiment, RA on 9 November 1944 (with the 'Essex Fortress' subtitle being authorised on 21 December).74 Garrison Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.

When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the 74th Searchlight Regiment was reformed at Tottenham as 609 (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Tottenham), equipped with anti-aircraft guns. ('Mixed' indicating that it was composed partly of members of the Women's Royal Army Corps). The regiment formed part of the short-lived 52 AA Brigade, based at Chingford, Essex.Frederick, p. 1026.592‚Äì638 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. Simultaneously, the former 469 Searchlight Battery at Chelmsford, the direct descendant of the Essex Fortress Engineers, was reformed as 855th Anti-Aircraft Fire Command Battery, RA (Essex Fortress). This was initially assigned to 98th Army Group RA (TA), an anti-aircraft formation formed for service with the Middle East Land Forces in time of war, but the AGRA disbanded in late 1948 and 855 AA C&R; Bty became a unit of 1st Anti-Aircraft Group, Anti-Aircraft Command in peacetime, though in the event of war it was still destined for service in the Middle East as part of 78 AGRA (AA) (TA). In 1953, the battery was authorised to adopt a supplementary arm title with the wording ESSEX FORTRESS in red on navy blue worn below the RA shoulder title.Frederick, p. 1031.Litchfield, p. 74.850‚Äì870 Btys at British Army 1945 on. After AA Command was abolished on 10 March 1955, 609 (Tottenham) HAA Rgt was disbanded by 1 July, and since no role could be found for 855 Bty, it was also disbanded on 1 August, thus ending the active life of the Essex (Fortress) RE.Routledge, Table LXXV, p. 442. Four years later, on 1 April 1959, a new 855 Bty appeared in the TA order of battle, as 855th Anti-Aircraft Reporting Battery, RA (TA). This, however, was not a descendant of the original 855, but was raised at Salford near Manchester by amalgamating existing independent AA Reporting Troops in the area. (Some previously published sources have erroneously attributed the new Bty to Chelmsford and the Essex (F) RE, however this is incorrect). In May 1961, the Battery was disbanded again, when the technically trained personnel went to 470 (3rd West Lancashire) Light Air Defence Regt, RA (TA) and the remainder to 287 (1st West Lancashire) Medium Regt, RA (TA).444‚Äì473 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.266‚Äì288 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.

The first Samanvay was held in 2011. ILF Samanvay was conceived in 2011 as an annual celebration of writing in Indian languages. The festival has aimed at generating dialogue across Indian languages at various levels and has emerged as the only literature festival dedicated exclusively to Indian languages. 2011 inaugural The inaugural edition (2011) tried to explore the problem of bringing various literatures under the master signifier, \\"Indian\\" and the mysterious bond that makes these various literatures at once distinct and collective. In 2012, the festival moved on to highlight and discover the heritage of Indian languages through the strain of Boli, Baani, Bhasha: Gaon, Kasba, Shehar. Even in 2013 the theme Jodti Zubanein, Judti Zubanein: Language Connections aimed at -discussing the various kinds of dialogues across the 'regional' languages and their multifaceted interaction with the 'national' languages - Hindi and English. In 2014, Samanvay highlighted ‚ÄòTranslation/Transnation‚Äô focus on Indian languages which have a transnational presence. The first four editions of the festival featured 20 languages presented by more than 150 Writers including some of the contemporary masters like Sitakant Mahapatra, Ratan Thiyam, K. Satchidanandan, Ashok Vajpeyi, Sheen Kaaf Nizam, Girish Kasaravalli, Udaya Narayana Singh, Nabarun Bhattacharya, Rajendra Yadav, Mangalesh Dabral, Yumlembam Ibomcha, Arjun Deo Charan, Anupam Mishra, Gulzar, Jerry Pinto, Ketan Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Mukul Kesavan, Piyush Mishra, Ravish Kumar, Sharada Sinha, Sanjay Kak, Shashi Deshpande, Kavita Krishnan, Vrinda Grover, Kancha Ilaiah, Alok Rai, K.

Awards The festival bestows two major awards: * The Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award *The ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman which is given to recognise the best book written in the last five years in any of the focal languages of the festival in any given year. This award was a lifetime achievement award till 2014, but was changed to a book award in 2015. Tamil Writer Perumal Murugan's Mathorubhagan (One Part Woman) has been named for the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2015. ILF Samanvay 2015: Insider/Outsider: Writing India's Dreams and Realities This year from 26 to 29 November, India Habitat Centre (IHC) will celebrate the 5thedition of its Indian Languages Festival ‚Äì Samanvay 2015. The festival, which has over the years become a must-attend for the Capital's Art & Culture aficionados, has expanded its scope to engage a wider range of audience by bringing into its panels, multi-level interpretations of the central theme, ‚ÄòInsider/Outsider: Writing India‚Äôs Dreams and Realities‚Äô. The languages that will be explored in detail at ILF Samanvay. 2015 languages are Tamil, Bangla, Marathi and Dogri. Overall design and logo Amid rampant instability of thought and violence infecting communication, ILF Samanvay aspires to thrive as a space for relevant reflection and uninhibited celebration of the inherent companionship of Indian linguistic cultures. Its overall design, including that of all its intellectual, physical and virtual sites, thus evokes India's cultural destiny vis-√†-vis its multiple political aspirations on the one hand and the future of humanity at large on the other. Hence, the festival design reflects the concerns and responsibility of the Indian writers, artists and other creative thinkers towards creating a condition and environment to bring the multi- centred country into a cultural camaraderie rather than any attempt at homogenisation. The ILF Samanvay logo is the visual embodiment of the above design concept. While the curious interweaving of straight lines and curves in the scripting of the term ‚ÄòSamanvay‚Äô has from its inception reflected the continuum of tradition and modernity that the festival emphasises, it is branded as ILF Samanvay in its fifth year, considering its one-of-its-kind status in the country as a festival bringing Indian languages together. The revised logo marks the directional integrity in the organisation of the festival. Riyas Komu Artist Riyas Komu who conceptualised the new visual expression of the ILF Samanvay logo says: \\"In our times characterized by fragile thoughts and volatile expressions, an Indian languages festival such as Samanvay must live and present itself as a profound space for thinking. It must be a site to reflect on the past, present and future of humanity and nature at large. Hence, the attempt here has been to create a head space that represents the thoughtscape embedded in Indian languages. Again, as we need an insignia for thinkers who can make relevant changes, the red dot becomes the mark of that awareness. The seven colours of the spectrum, capable of forming white light on their merger, are laid in a seed form in the line above the lettering of Samanvay in the logo. Another indication of the 'coming together' inherent in the festival, this linear mandala also intimates one of the possibility of playing with each of these colours in specific contexts within the frame of the festival.\\" The festival will open with Education Thinker, Prof. Aijaz Ahmad discussing the possibility of evolving a methodology for language and literary studies in the country. Prof. Ahmad's inaugural lecture, ‚ÄòThe Languages of a Union‚Äô, will highlight how in India, political unity does not automatically give us, or requires of us, literary or linguistic unity. He would discuss the significance of examining the hierarchical relations existing among languages and traditions, and the need to develop a system of education that profoundly addresses the question of multilingualism. 2015 The deliberations at Samanvay 2015 will unfold with a session paying tributes to the late RK Laxman and his matchless legacy. Cartoonist Unny, Outlook Chief Editor Krishna Prasad, and cartoon researcher and writer, Christel Devadawson will together unravel the complex field of Indian cartooning while looking at Laxman's unique contribution to shaping its sensibilities. This session on the opening evening will lead the discourse of ‚ÄòInsider/Outsider‚Äô forward into the main festival sessions. The central theme of Samanvay 2015, Insider/Outsider: Writing India's Dreams and Realities, evokes the liminality of the writer/creative artist/inventor in a given context. A creative act necessitates an individual to move out of a certain state of being, into an experimental space where she has to play out her ideas and desires into comprehensible forms. This transition makes every writer a liminal being, an insider/outsider. Yet, some writers and artists become more of insiders and some others more of outsiders to the existing patterns. The subtitle suggests how writers who understand the in-between space of uncertainty, the transitory status that makes one neither here nor there, bring out the dreams and realities of a complex space such as India. It also points to the need for an artist to remain tentative, and resist fixities. Day 2 of Samanvay will focus on a thematic exploration of ‚ÄòInsider/Outsider‚Äô in the contemporary socio- political and cultural context of India. Day 3 will feature sessions on the focal languages of Samanvay 2015, and Day 4 will attempt to expand the theme with the futuristic vision which the festival embodies. Various workshops, volunteer sessions, conversations, book exhibitions and performances will also be an integral part of Samanvay 2015. Its democratic and inclusive spirit gets amply reflected in a special session on Day 2, which is completely designed by the student volunteers of Samanvay. This one-hour session titled Inside the Exile will feature readings by Tibetan writers followed by a Q&A; to explore the Insider/Outsider aspects of being Tibetans in India. This session, among others, has ensured more youth participation in the organization of the festival. At Samanvay, the workshop sessions are not supplementary but are integral to the exploration of languages outside of the verbal realm, too. On Day 3, a translation workshop has been planned with exercises that would lead to a publication. Avadhesh Kumar Singh, Dean of School of Translation Studies at IGNOU will be in charge of this. 2015 summary Spread over four days with multiple events, ILF Samanvay 2015 will ensure that the theme is carried on to extra-literary and epistemic fields too. The sessions concerning the child's position vis-a-vis writing and publishing in the country; gender and sexuality; media and language; the architectural, ecological and cultural continuities and discontinuities that make the city of Delhi etc. are cases in point. The Art Appreciation workshop by the renowned cultural critic Sadanand Menon is a major value addition in this regard. Talking about the festival, Rakesh Kacker, Festival Director Samanvay & Director - India Habitat Centre , says, ‚ÄúOne does not necessarily have to recognise language as a basic instinct to properly appreciate its role as an organic part of human existence. Civilizations have been formed and continue to take shape around languages, uniting and dividing in swift strokes. This, precisely, is the theme we would explore in India Habitat Centre‚Äôs fifth annual Indian Languages‚Äô Festival, Samanvay. In an increasingly globalised world the alienation that writers often face for their lingual and cultural choices is now a much hackneyed subject in the area of literary discourse. Here at Samanvay, we invite you to partake in the discussions that would take this conversation one step forward.‚Äù Elaborating further, Rizio Yohannan Raj, Creative Director, ILF Samanvay says, ‚ÄúSamanvay is a relevant call to reawaken the Indian genius for cultural cooperation in our times. A dynamic yet nuanced initiative to facilitate genuine camaraderie at the intersections of Indian languages, the festival celebrates the diversities embedded in the transnational matrix of the country. Through multiple verbal as well as transverbal media, and various modes of translation, Samanvay interprets Indian Languages beyond word-limits and explores the socio-historical connections among the idioms of literature, visual arts, music, performance. Towards fulfilling this larger vision of creativity and institutionalising its enterprise, Samanvay‚Äôs inclusive framework presents workshops, freewheeling conversations, focussed discussions, public readings, exhibitions, performances. The festival theme for 2015, ‚ÄúInsider/Outsider: Writing India‚Äôs Dreams and Realities‚Äù emphasises the liminality of the creative individual in any given context, and all the sessions explore this notion quite intensely, thus lending the festival an organic as well as sustainable design.‚Äù 2015 speakers The distinguished speakers include Tenzin Tsunde, Jeet Thayil, TM Krishna, Urvashi Butalia, Aman Nath, Ayesha Kidwai, Sadanand Menon, Bhuchung Sonam, EP Unny, Arunava Sinha, Sachin Ketkar, AR Venkatachalapathy, Rakshanda Jalil, Bulbul Sharma, Avadhesh Kumar Singh, K Satchidanandan, Meena Alexander, Sharmila Seyyid, Padma Sachdev, Rosalyn DeMello, Khushbu, Kannan Sundaram, Shubro Bandyopadhyay, Dolochampa Chakravary, Ashok Vajpeyi Ramkumar Mukhopadhyay, Makarand Sathe, Iravati Karve, Vaibhav Abnave, Dharmakriti Sumant, Samina Mishra, Jerry Pinto, Radhika Menon, J Devika, Manabi Bandyopadhya, Saleem Kidwai, Priya Sarukkari Chhabria, Arundhathi Subramanian, H.S Shiva Prakash, Navtej Johar, Maya Krishna Rao, Anuradha Kapur, Come Carpentier, Fareeda Mehta, Margaret Mascarenhas.  AWARDS  ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2015 Tamil writer Peruman Murugan's novel Madhorubhagan has bagged the fourth ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman, the prestigious annual award instituted by the IHC Indian Languages Festival Samanvay. The award for 2015 was decided by an eminent jury chaired by K. Satchidanandan, and included as its other members Sachin Ketkar, Manglesh Dabral, Mitra Phukan and Arundhati Subramaniam. The Jury selected Madhorubhagan after a detailed process of inviting nominations from five focal languages of ILF Samanvay 2015‚Äì Tamil, Marathi, Bangla, Dogri and Mizo. These nominations were then screened by the Award Advisors and a final selection was made by the Jury from the final shortlist. Jury Chair K Satchidanandan says: \\"Perual Murugan's Madhorubhagan (One Part Woman) is a rooted and passionate work of fiction that narrates with searing intensity and unsparing clarity the story of a relationship caught between the dictates of social convention and the tug of personal anxieties. This historian of the Kongu region of Tamilnadu has brought into play his lyrical imagination, linguistic skill and lexical knowledge in this honest exploration of the tyranny of caste and the pathology of a community. Inspired by local folklore and history, this great work of fiction dreams of a secular future for communities in India that remain hostage to the ways of the past. It is an imaginative contribution by a versatile writer and scholar to the collective struggle for a new India free from the oppression of caste and enslaving conventions.\\" Responding to the award announcement Perumal Murugan gave this statement: The IHC Director who is also the Festival Director of ILF Samanvay says: ‚ÄòIt gives the IHC great pleasure to announce the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman for Perumal Murugan. The Tamil literary canon has been expanded with the induction of the series of novels and short stories that Perumal Murugan has written. Madhorubhagan occupies pride of place in this canon. This award for Madhorubhagan is a recognition of how a writer and his insider-outsider act of writing could serve the society and connect its histories with its contemporary realities and dreams.‚Äù Perumal Murugan is a well-known Tamil writer and poet. He has written nine novels and four collections each of short stories and poetry. Three of his novels have been translated into English to wide critical acclaim: Seasons of the Palm, which was shortlisted for the prestigious Kiriyama Prize in 2005, Current Show and One part woman. He has received awards from the Tamil Nadu government as well as from Katha Books. The ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman has undergone a makeover this year. Till last year, named Samanvay Bhasha Samman, this honour was bestowed on an eminent writer who had contributed significantly to the growth of one or more Indian languages. Last year, the third Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2014 was conferred upon Ashok Vajpeyi, the well-known author, scholar, critic and poet for his lifelong contribution to Hindi Literature in particular and Indian Literature in general. The second Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2013 was conferred upon veteran Gujarati author Chandrakant Topiwala for \\"his lifetime contribution to Gujarati and Indian literature; for his commitment for independence and objectivity in cultural life; for standing against the authoritarian forces in contemporary Indian society and broadening the scope of human empathy through an extraordinary body of work.\\" The inaugural award in 2012 had been conferred upon the legendary Odiya writer Sitakant Mahapatra for \\"his lifetime contribution to Odiya and Indian literature; for extraordinary efforts in generating dialogue across Indian languages through creative and administrative activism, for emancipation of dialects and oral traditions and for unrelenting advocacy of plurality of idea and expression.\\" Fifth year In this fifth year of India Habit Centre's Indian Languages Festival Samanvay, as part of the rethinking of the festival as a significant and enduring space to facilitate growth, development of connections of Indian languages in the contemporary times, it was decided that every year, an important literary work in one of the focal languages of the festival, should be given the award, as such a scheme is more aligned to the vision and mission of the ILF Samanvay. Hence, the Award has been named ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman, and from a cluster of five languages from the five regions of the country‚ÄîTamil, Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Mizo‚Äî nominations were called from a large panel of publishers, academicians, critics/writers. Works‚ÄîPoetry Fiction Creative non-fiction; e.g. Autobiographies, Travelogues, Memoirs, etc.‚Äîpublished in the last 5 years in these languages were considered. To begin the process, each language's advisers suggested 5 critics/writers, 5 academicians, and 5 publishers who sent in their nominations in an elaborate format prepared for this purpose. Each nominator sent 3 nominations, and filled up the questionnaire in justification of the nomination. Criteria for nominations specified that the book should: i) Preferably have been translated in any other Indian Language. This criterion, however, is NOT mandatory. ii) Have been published between Jan 2010‚ÄîDec 2014. iii) Be considered significant in the particular language. iv) Have brought a breakthrough in the literary scenario of that particular language. v) Have extended the frontiers of language and style vi) be not just commercial but aesthetically rich. vi) Have some social and/or literary substance to it. vii) Challenge established norms. viii) Have brought a shift in the canon. ix) Have made a considerable impact on the language it has been written in. x) The advisers are free to add books over and above the nominations received per language. =Shortlisting= The advisers of Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Tamil shortlisted 2 books per language. Though nominations were received from Mizo, the advisors did not recommend any for the award. Each panel of advisors of the four languages prepared a critical justification for the members of the jury explaining their choice for the 2 books shortlisted. From among these 8 nominations the jury members chose Perumal Murugan's Madhorubhagan. Shortlisted works 1\\\\. Bangla Prabal Kumar Basu, Bhalo Bolte Shikhun, Anita Agnihotri, Desher Bhitor Desh 2\\\\. Dogri Om Goswami, Unni Sou Santali, Lalit Magotra, Hello Maya 3\\\\. Marathi Mahabaleswara Sail, Tandav, L. S. Jadhav, Horpal 4\\\\. Tamil Perumal Murugan, Madhorubhagan, Imayam, Savu Soru The award ceremony is scheduled between 6pm and 7pm on Saturday the 28th of November at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.  Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award  The commitment of ILF Samanvay to the development of a democracy of Indian languages is asserted by the announcement of a major Award for a distinguished translator, and a couple of interesting prizes for young writers. In the wake of Tamil Writer Peruman Murugan's novel Madhorubhagan (One Part Woman) bagging the fourth ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman, the festival organisers have announced yet another much-awaited and relevant annual award which ILF Samanvay has instituted in collaboration with Vani Foundation: Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award. Scheduled from 26 to 29 November 2015, ILF Samanvay 2015 has expanded its scope to engage a wider section of the society. It is as part of enlarging its mandate that a national level award for a distinguished translator who has contributed in a sustained and quality manner towards direct exchanges between two Indian languages, has been instituted. This award will be given as part of the activities initiated by ILF Samanvay every year. The India Habitat Centre and Vani Foundation have jointly conceptualised this award in view of the lack of recognitions encouraging direct exchanges between Indian languages without a mediating language. This award is hoped to encourage contemporary translators in the linguistically diverse sub-continent with a rich history of literary exchange. The award is worth INR 1,00,000 (Rupees One lakh) and as far as possible this award will consider translators directly translating between two Indian languages and have sustained this activity for a considerable period of time and produced a remarkable body of work. The jury of the award include writers Namita Gokhale, Ashok Vajpeyi, Rizio Yohannan Raj, IHC Programmes Director Vidyun Singh, NBT Director and writer Rita Choudhury, and writer-scholar Rita Kothari. Announcing the institution of Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award, the Director of India Habitat Centre, Rakesh Kacker said: \\"I am delighted that this award has fructified in a very short period. Thanks and Congratulations to all who have made this happen. The addition of this award to ILF Samanvay's range of activities will help to enrich the festival and its institutional mission. It would also strengthen the important work of translation and help different linguistic groups in the country to communicate meaningfully with one another.\\" Arun Maheshwari, the Chairman of Vani Foundation, that has co-founded the Award, said on the occasion: \\"Our country's rich cultural diversity and its expression into arts and literature have been largely unexplored. Vani Foundation was established with the mission of not only re-discovering these idioms, but also connecting Indian languages with one another and with the world. We found congruence of energy and vision with the new team at ILF Samanvay and therefore feel proud to announce Vani- Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award. The award is committed to celebrate the unsung heroes of Indian translation fraternity, especially those who have tirelessly dedicated themselves to not only translating between two languages, but also bridging two cultures.\\" The Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator award is in keeping with the great emphasis ILF Samanvay has laid on translation this year. The festival has initiated a collaborative translation project with the School of Translation Studies and Training, IGNOU, besides three festival panels dedicated exclusively to look at various issues concerning translation in the county. Poetry contest =HIR-PITHARA youth poetry contest= As part of expanding its mandate, and reaching out to nurture the creativity of the young speakers of different Indian languages in the Delhi-NCR region, ILF Samanvay has also announced an interesting youth poetry contest as part of the festival: The HIR-PITHARA YOUTH POETRY CONTEST. The mascot of this poetry contest is the resplendent figure of HIR‚Äîthe ageless, androgynous, itinerant storyteller.(Mascot attached) Speaking of Hir, Rizio Yohannan Raj, Creative Director of ILF Samanvay said: \\"Hir (Pronounced ‚Äòheer‚Äô) is a quintessential insider-outsider, true to the time and the theme- zone wherein hir arrives at ILF Samanvay in Delhi. Hir is a child-adult of the future, and begins hir travel mid-way, in classic medias res, at ILF Samanvay. Hir is pronoun and noun at once; Hir is a child's self-expression as well as an adult's quest for meaning. Hir represents the ‚Äòsamanvay‚Äô of the self and the other in our fragmented times. Red-robed, Hir is the self-same heart of pure revolution and ardent love. In the coming days, we shall see Hir extending travel from Delhi to different time zones, varied spacescapes, carrying hir ‚ÄòPithara‚Äô , gathering creative voices from among the young and the young at heart of the country. Inspired by the 9-year old Adel Tushar Kumar's uninhibited painting of a storyteller, Hir is given hir current form by the ILF Samanvay team. Hir Stories are going to be a regular feature of Y: The ILF Samanvay Blog.\\" ILF Samanvay 2015 invites poetry submissions for the HIR-PITHARA poetry contest 2015 in all Indian languages. One can submit any number of poems in one‚Äôs original language, on the theme \\"Insider/Outsider‚Äô. The length of poem has to be limited to one A4 size page, and has to be separately submitted in the specified format, along with a translation in either English or Hindi. This journey of Hir in the context of IL F Samanvay through the historical city of Delhi is to map, mainstream and celebrate Delhi's hidden pockets of creativity. Poetry submissions can either be made online in the requisite format available on www.ilfsamanvay.org or dropped at the Hir-Pitharas (Poetry bags) kept at the IHC campus in Lodhi Road and in select locations. The hard copy submission must mark the name, age, address and affiliation of the participant. Details will be available online at the ILF Samanvay website from Tuesday, 20 October.

She was a post-doctoral fellow 2012‚Äì16 at Yale University, working with Debra Fischer. Boyajian is active in the astronomical fields of stellar interferometry, stellar spectroscopy, exoplanet research, and high angular resolution astronomy, all particularly at optical and infrared wavelengths. She was the lead author of the September 2015 paper \\"Where's the Flux?\\", which investigated the highly unusual light curve of KIC 8462852; the star is colloquially known as Tabby's Star in her honor. Background Boyajian received a BS degree in Physics with concentration in Astronomy from the College of Charleston in 2003, an MS degree in Physics from Georgia State University in 2005, and a PhD degree in Philosophy of Astronomy from the same university in 2009.CV Dr. Tabetha Suzanne Boyajian - scientific literature digital library CiteSeerX She studied the sizes of nearby stars similar to the Sun, using the University's CHARA array, a long-baseline optical and infrared interferometer located at Mount Wilson Observatory. Boyajian was awarded a Hubble Fellowship, and stayed at Georgia State University to study sizes of nearby stars much smaller than the Sun and stars with planets. Fellow astronomer Sarah Ballard has described this as \\"truly remarkable\\" work and has used what she calls this \\"precious sample\\" of data on nearby small stars for the \\"characterization by proxy\\" method to help investigate the far more distant exoplanet Kepler-61b. Boyajian cowrote Extrasolar Planets and Their Host Stars in 2017 with Kaspar von Braun . , Boyajian is secretary and steering committee member of Division G Stars and Stellar Physics of the International Astronomical Union. Boyajian is also manager of the Planet Hunters project in which amateurs analyze data from the Kepler space observatory. Tabby's Star On 14 October 2015, a strange pattern of light from star KIC 8462852, nicknamed \\"Tabby's Star\\" after Boyajian ‚Äì the lead researcher who discovered the irregular light fluctuation ‚Äì was captured by the Kepler Space Telescope, and raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered. In February 2016, Boyajian gave a TED talk where she explained why she and others thought they had possibly discovered a massive alien structure and speculation on Dyson's Spheres: Wanting to understand the strange light pattern, Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. Everyone's first thought was an exoplanet detected around this massive star, but the dips in light lasted anywhere from 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object. A dust cloud was proposed but the star showed no signs of being young so a dust cloud was highly improbable. Lastly, a comet shower was hypothesized. However as Boyajian pointed out in her TED talk this was the most likely out of all the hypotheses and yet was still highly improbable. So after all the natural explanations turned up weak, her team decided to send off their research to SETI (Search for extraterrestrial intelligence) to rule out aliens. After reviewing the research the SETI Institute was so intrigued that they decided to study the star themselves and pointed their Allen Telescope Array (ATA) at the star \\"with hopes of catching a tell-tale signal that might reveal a technological civilization.\\" The SETI Institute mentioned what caught their eye and made them take on the research themselves: \\"Even more interesting, the timing of the present dip (in light) suggests that whatever this material is, it is situated at just the right distance from the star to be in the 'habitable zone,' where we believe life like ours could develop as it has on Earth.\\" Being as skeptical as Boyajian was, she took SETI's approach and allowed herself to have a bit of fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: The search for answers to KIC 8462852 is still ongoing, with two papers published in the summer of 2019 offering plausible scientific scenarios, involving larger moons being stripped from their planets.

The resolution for the formation of this committee passed in the Senate on September 6, 1945, and in the House on September 11, 1945. The final report of the committee issued on June 20, 1946. Origins Various investigations followed the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, including one ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the direction of Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, and another conducted by the army and navy released by President Harry Truman in August 1945. Congress, however, postponed investigation during while the World War II was ongoing. On September 6, 1945, four days after the formal surrender of Japan, Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley presented a Senate resolution urging the creation of a joint investigatory committee to explore \\"contradictions and inconsistencies\\" in the preceding reports. The Senate unanimously approved Barkley's Concurrent Resolution 27 the same day, and the House concurred on September 11, creating the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, commonly known as the Pearl Harbor Committee. The resolution authorized a 10-member committee, evenly divided between members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and chaired by Senator Barkley, to investigate \\"facts relating to the events and circumstances leading up to or following the attack made by Japanese armed forces upon Pearl Harbor\\". The committee selected William D. Mitchell, former attorney general under Republican president Herbert Hoover, as its first counsel. Originally authorized to issue a final report on January 3, 1946, Congress passed a series of resolutions extending the life of the committee to allow members more time to hear witnesses. From November of 1945 through May of 1946, the committee heard testimony in the Senate Caucus Room from 44 people, including top level military commanders such as Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short, and former ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew and former secretary of state Cordell Hull. The hearing transcripts filled more than 5,000 printed pages and included some 14,000 pages of printed exhibits. Membership Senator Alben W. Barkley chaired the committee. The membership of the committee was as follows: *Chairman: Senator Alben W. Barkley (D-KY) *Vice Chairman: Representative Jere Cooper (D-TN) *Committee members: **Senator Owen Brewster (R-ME) **Representative J. Bayard Clark (D-NC) **Senator Homer S.

Murphy (D-PA) Investigation On August 28, 1945, President Truman issued an executive order directing several government departments and the joint chiefs of staff \\"to take such steps as are necessary to prevent release to the public\\" information related to a U.S. cryptanalysis program to crack Japanese coded transmissions. When Congress formed the Pearl Harbor Committee a few weeks later, members objected to the withholding of information by the executive branch. The president revised the order, directing some individuals to \\"make available to the Joint Committee on the Investigation of Pearl Harbor Attack ‚Ä¶ any information in their possession material to the investigation.\\" Though numerous investigations of the attack preceded the congressional inquiry, some files related to the attack had never been located. Partly to facilitate the search for missing documents and partly because, in the words of one historian, Republicans \\"did not trust counsel to find and produce all relevant information\\", Senator Owen Brewster proposed a resolution to authorize individual committee members \\"in company with a member of the staff, to examine any records deemed to be relevant to the current investigation\\". The committee voted down Brewster's resolution on a straight party-line vote. Senators Homer Ferguson and Brewster, both members of the Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (also known as the Truman committee) were seasoned investigators. Frustrated by the committee's decision, they appealed to their colleagues from the Senate floor. Senator Brewster complained that committee members had not been \\"granted the same latitude in the examination of governmental records that was always accorded without question during the history of the Truman committee\\". The Pearl Harbor investigation, Brewster urged, should pursue new lines of inquiry, rather than \\"review what had already been put in the record\\". Senator Ferguson asked, \\"Are we confined in our investigation only to the matters appearing in the existing official reports?\\" In reality, the executive branch deluged the committee with documents and exhibits, prompting Senator Brewster to lodge his \\"regret and protest‚Äîat the first public committee hearing about the \\"premature beginning of this inquiry\\" noting, \\"it is just a physical impossibility to go over the [more than 1000 exhibits] prior to this hearing.\\" Disagreements over committee procedure led, at times, to acrimonious exchanges among senators on the Senate floor. James Tunnell of Delaware denounced Brewster and Ferguson's demands for greater access to material as a partisan plan to \\"dig up something\\" that could be used to \\"besmirch the reputation of the Nation's wartime Commander in Chief [Franklin Roosevelt]\\".91 Cong. Rec. Part 8, p. 10856. Brewster dismissed Tunnell's \\"extreme attack\\" as an inaccurate characterization of his effort to simply \\"explore the files\\". Debates over procedure were driven, at least in part, by Republican concerns that Barkley's long-standing allegiance to President Roosevelt made him incapable of objectively pursuing the Pearl Harbor inquiry. Barkley's close association with the president dated to 1937 when Roosevelt intervened on Barkley's behalf to ensure his election as majority leader and continued until Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. As one historian observed, \\"Barkley accepted his role of presidential flag carrier, but it took him years to regain confidence or to command the loyalty\\" of members of his own party. Outcome The eight members who signed the majority report found that \\"officers, both in Washington and Hawaii, were fully conscious of the danger from air attack\\". The Hawaiian commands and the Intelligence and War Plans Divisions of the War and Navy Departments made \\"errors of judgment and not derelictions of duty\\". Authors rejected the claim that President Roosevelt and top advisors \\"tricked, provoked, incited, cajoled, or coerced Japan\\" into attacking the United States in order to draw the nation into war. Senators Brewster and Ferguson penned a minority report, dismissing the majority's conclusions as \\"illogical\\". \\"When all the testimony, papers, documents, exhibits, and other evidence duly laid before the Committee are reviewed\\", they wrote, \\"it becomes apparent that the record is far from complete\\". In the end, the committee left many questions unanswered. \\"Why, with some of the finest intelligence available in our history\\", wondered the committee, \\"why was it possible for a Pearl Harbor to occur?\\" The final report noted \\"interdepartmental misunderstanding\\" which \\"prejudiced the effectiveness\\" of intelligence. Though its findings were not conclusive, the committee's recommendations had a lasting effect. The majority report recommended centralizing \\"operational and intelligence work\\" and drawing more \\"clear-cut\\" lines of responsibility among intelligence agencies. Some of these recommendations became law when Congress passed and the president signed the National Security Act of 1947. The law consolidated the military into a newly- formed Department of Defense directed by a secretary of defense. The act also established the Central Intelligence Agency to gather and evaluate intelligence related to national security. The committee concluded that \\"[t]he ultimate responsibility for the attack and its results rests upon Japan\\", and that \\"the diplomatic policies and actions of the United States provided no justifiable provocation whatever for the attack by Japan on this Nation.\\" Public relations The Pearl Harbor investigation never piqued the public interest like other notable Senate inquiries. After four long years of war, a weary nation longed for peace and reconciliation. News media accounts often characterized the committee as politically divided, featuring headlines such as: \\"Angry Senators Debate on 'Records' of Pearl Harbor\\".C.P. Trussell, \\"Angry Senators Debate on 'Records' of Pearl Harbor\\", The New York Times (November 3, 1945), A-1.

Together with her husband, Kuo Pao Kun, she co-founded the Singapore Performing Arts School (now The Theatre Practice), a seminal institution in Singaporean modern theater and dance. During the mid-1970s, both Goh and her husband were branded as enemies of the state and detained in mass arrests of alleged communist sympathizers. The 1980s and 90s, however, saw Goh rise in prominence. In 1988 she created Nu Wa ‚Äì Mender of the Heavens, Singapore's first modern dance production, and in 1995 she was awarded the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest award for artistic excellence. Early life Goh Lay Kuan was born in Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1939. Her parents were both teachers and had both learned music. Goh was one of six children, with four brothers and a sister. When she was still an infant, the family moved to Sungai Petani, British Malaya (now Malaysia), where Goh's father worked as the principal of a school. Two years later the family moved to Malacca to escape the Japanese invasion of Malaya. In 1945, when she was five years old, her father - then a resistance fighter - was killed by Japanese forces. Goh's mother remarried, again to a teacher, and took a teaching position in Singapore, bringing the family with her. Career At the age of 15, Goh began learning ballet dance from Goh Soo Nee, the sister of ballet dancers Goh Choo San and Goh Soo Khim. In a 2014 interview, Goh recalled that she was the last remaining student from an initial class of fifteen, and that she \\"went hungry\\" in order to afford the classes. After graduating high school, Goh worked as a teacher and tutor before moving to Australia to continue her ballet education at Melbourne's Victoria Ballet Guild. She graduated from the program with honors, and went on to be member of several groups including the Ballet Victoria, where she was the principal dancer. In 1964, Goh moved back to Singapore. Her motivations to return included racial discrimination, a sense that her people did not have a cultural identity to call their own, and the 1963 openings of the Singapore National Theatre and an arts-focused television station. Upon her return, she worked as a choreographer on that television station. The station was ill prepared in the beginning, and Singaporean performing arts in general was poorly organized at the time. In 1965, playwright Kuo Pao Kun, whom Goh had met and began dating in Australia, also moved back to Singapore. Goh and Kuo were married that year, and on the day of their wedding the couple founded the Singapore Performing Arts School (renamed the Practice Theatre School in 1973, the Practice Performing Arts School in 1984, and The Theatre Practice in 1997); Goh was the principal dance instructor, while Kuo taught drama. Goh's vision for the school was to be able to train enough professional dancers to form a company. Goh began to choreograph dances for the students, and her first work of ballet choreography was completed the same year that the school was founded. Practice Performing Arts School, which was founded right before Singapore became independent, received no financial support from the government. Goh and Kuo also refused to allow their families to fund the institution. At the time, people looking to learn drama relied on cultural groups, so there was not a tradition of paid instruction in drama. With all of these avenues of funding closed, the school was self funded and was in debt for its first seventeen years. As a result, Goh and Kuo, in addition to teaching and creating works to perform, also handled costumes and stage design themselves. Shortly after founding the school, the couple had their first daughter, Kuo Jian Hong, who was born in 1967. A second daughter, Kuo Jing Hong, was born in 1971. Goh and Kuo's willingness to poke fun at the government and to raise social and class issues in their performances led to frequent conflicts with the Singaporean government, which made it difficult for Goh to obtain permits for the school and banned some of Goh and Kuo's performances. The school had a \\"Go Into Life\\" campaign, which urged artists to spend time working alongside farmers and laborers in order to experience their lives. In 1969, Goh created a ballet titled The Fishing Village which focused on the lives of ordinary people in a fishing village. Another performance, created by Kuo and titled \\"gai si de cang ying\\" (\\"damn the fly\\"), was about reactions to a fly at a fruit stall and was inspired by the reactions of a TV station to a fly appearing in a speech by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Aggravating matters, the Communist People's Republic of China had begun using ballet as a vehicle for promoting communist ideology. By the 1970s, the governing party of Singapore began to view socially conscious theater as a threat to the state. In 1975 the government, under the authority of the Internal Security Act, began a campaign of mass arrests of suspected communists and communist-sympathizers, and in 1976 both Goh and Kuo were arrested and held without trial. Goh was branded \\"The Red Ballerina\\" and was forced to give a televised confession; shortly after the confession Goh was released, however Kuo spent over four years in prison. While Goh ran the school during Kuo's incarceration, his release in 1980 brought new life to the institution; both Goh and Kuo began creating new works, and the school began putting on more performances. During this time she extended her repertoire, studying traditional Indian, Indonesian, and Chinese dance as well as modern dance, the latter at the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance in New York City. In 1988 Goh was commissioned to produce a work for the Singapore Festival of Arts. That work, which was influenced by Chinese mythology, became Nu Wa ‚Äì Mender of the Heavens, Singapore's first full-length modern dance production. The Straits Times called Nu Wa the nation's \\"most significant modern dance ever produced\\". In 1988 Goh also launched a program at the school aimed at young children between the ages of 3 and 6. She retired from leading the school four years later, in 1992, in order to focus on producing new works. These works included Sheng Ji (\\"Rites of Life\\") and Yu Gui (\\"Homing\\"), which were first performed in 1994 by the Guangdong Modern Dance Company. After Kuo Pao Kun's death in 2002, their daughter Kuo Jian Hong returned to assume a leadership role at the school. Goh's most recent work is Returning, a 50-minute work which incorporates elements of Chinese, Malay, and Indian dance. The piece is a collaboration involving five choreographers and six musical composers. Honors In 1995 Goh was awarded the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest award for artistic excellence. In 2014, she was inducted into the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations' Singapore Women's Hall of Fame. In 2010, Ong Keng Sen, who studied under Goh, created a documentary performance about Goh entitled The Red Ballerina. Ong worked with Lim Kay Tong and Karen Tan on the production. Ong would go on to create another work about Goh, Goh Lay Kuan & Kuo Pao Kun, in 2012.

Built c. 1848-51, this well-preserved Italianate house was the home of United States Vice President Hannibal Hamlin from 1862 until his death in 1891. From 1933 until 2007 it served as the official residence of the president of Bangor Theological Seminary. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Hamlin House is located on the northwest side of 5th Street, just south of Hammond Street in a residential area west of Bangor's downtown area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof (a later addition) that provides for a full third floor. The front portion of the house has flushboard siding, while the rear ell is clapboarded. The roof is composed of decoratively cut slate shingles, and has paired brackets in the eaves. The street-facing facade is two bays wide, with a hip-roof porch extending across its width, supported by square posts with paired brackets at the top. The main entrance is on the northeast side, under a similar porch with a projecting vestibule. The house was built sometime between 1848 and 1851 by William T. Hilliard, a clerk of the local court and deputy collector of customs. It was purchased in 1862 by Hannibal Hamlin, during his single term as Vice President of the United States under Abraham Lincoln. Hamlin made this house his home until his death in 1891, adding the mansard roof and third story in 1870. Hamlin was from 1836 to his death a major figure in Maine politics, serving the state legislature, the United States Congress (both House and Senate), as first a Democrat and from 1856, as a Republican. He also briefly served as Governor of Maine in 1857. In 1933 Hamlin's son donated the house to the Bangor Theological Seminary, which used it for many years as the official residence of its president. The house was sold (along with the rest of the seminary campus) to developers in 2007.

The palace is located on Via Ferdinando Zannetti 8 near the corner with Via Cerretani in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. Exterior of the Palace  History  In the place where the palace there were the old houses of the Martelli family, since the twenties of the sixteenth century. In 1627, the area of this palace was aggregated after the marriage of Senator Marco Martelli and his cousin. Marco also acquired further buildings. Some frescoes on the main floor date to this era. The Cardinal Francesco Martelli (1633‚Äì1717) was a member of this family. In 1738, Giuseppe Martelli Maria, Archbishop of Florence and Niccolo Martelli, bailiff of Florence, unified the palaces under the designs of the architect Bernardino Ciurini. The piano nobile of the palace was decorated by frescoes by Vincenzo Meucci, Ferdinando Melani, Niccol√≤ Connestabile, and Bernardo Minozzi, as well as stuccowork by Giovanni Martino Portogalli. At the end of the eighteenth century Marco, son of Niccolo, commissioned further frescoes depicting mythological and historic episodes of the family from teams led by Tommaso Gherardini, while Luigi Sabatelli decorated the vault of the staircase, where they displayed once two works attributed to Donatello, a statue of David and the coat of arms of the family. The marble David statue is now displayed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and it is now felt to be a copy of the marble David by Donatello in the Bargello in Florence.The David of the Casa Martelli , c. 1461/1479 at National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, USA. Large parts of the house's artworks were sold over the past two centuries. In 1986, the last Martelli resident, Francesca Martelli, willed the house to the Curia of Florence. In 1998, the Curia sold the complex to the Italian state as part of a larger deal. This allowed the collections to be opened as a museum in 2006. Even accounting for the loss and dispersal of items, the collection remains impressive, including works by Piero di Cosimo, Francesco Francia, Francesco Morandini, Salvator Rosa, Giordano, Beccafumi, Sustermans, Michael Sweerts, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Orazio Borgianni, Francesco Curradi, and collections of small bronzes, including some by Soldani Benzi.

The palace is across the river from the Galleria of the Uffizi, and a block east of the Ponte Vecchio. The Via de' Bardi originates in an arch under the building. History The ownership of this site and palace is complex, because it changed hands many times since the construction of the palace. The area in front of the palace towards the river, now consisting of the Lungarno Torrigiani, included some houses and the razed Santa Maria dei Bardi, also called Santa Maria Sopr'Arno. This church is recalled by the Piazza on the river side. The general area prior to the mid 14th-century, belonged to the Bardi di Vernio, but many of the buildings were destroyed or looted during the Revolt of the Ciompi in 1343. The house at the site became property of the Medici, who sold it in 1480, to gonfaloniere Bernardo del Nero. He ended up executed in 1497 by the Savonarola's Republic for plotting the return of the Medici. The next owner, Raffaello Antinori, enlarged the palace to nearly its present size. In 1553 the palace was sold to the Capponi, who sold it in 1591 to the Torrigiani, owners of the nearby Palazzo Torrigiani who quickly sold it to Belisario Vinta, a long-serving administrator for the Medici, from Cosimo I to Cosimo II. Vinta created the facades on the via de Bardi side, including a portal with the bust of Cosimo II (1609). The design for Vinta's construction has been attributed to the architect Matteo Nigetti. In 1652, the heirs of Vinta sold the palace to Lorenzo di Raffaello de' Medici, who two years later sold it to the Tempi (1654). They utilized the architect Pietro Paolo Giovannozzi to refurbish the lungarno facade. To refurbish the interiors, he commissioned from Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani to fresco (1726) a large ceiling. This fresco was destroyed when part of the roof collapsed from the effects of the mining of the bridges set off by the retreating Germans in 1944. The Bargagli Petrucci, who inherited the property from the Tempi in 1770, used the architect Enrico Lusini, for much of the restoration of damages due to war and flooding. Among the remaining frescoes are landscapes of the Coast of Magnoli in the entry stairwell by Matteo Bonechi. Other frescoes by Bonechi decorate certain rooms of the second floor, including depictions of the Myth of Prometheus, the Judgement of Paris, the Allegory of the four Seasons, the Bath of Diana, and an Allegory of Florence. Another room is frescoed with Allegories of Vice and Virtue, by Ranieri Del Pace.Palazzo Spinelli, Repertorio delle Architetture Civile di Firenze, entry by Claudio Paolini. There is a legend, linked to properties in this area including the former church of Santa Maria Sopr'Arno, that resembles that of Romeo and Juliet, in that two lovers, Ippolito and Dianora, from the feuding families of Buondelmonti and Bardi respectively fall in love. The young man attempting to elope with the young woman is arrested. To protect her honor, he confesses to robbery. Yet while Ippolito is being led to execution past Dianora's house, she intercedes, the execution is cancelled, and they live happily ever after.Marietta de' Ricci, ovvero Firenze al tempo dell'assedio, Volume 3, page 1149-1150.

Its summit is marked by York Tower ‚Äì a 3-storey octagonal folly erected in 1827 to commemorate Prince Frederick, the Duke of York; and the Forteath Mausoleum ‚Äì built in 1850 as the burial place of 7 members of the Forteath family of the nearby house of Newton. The hill is the site of a hill fort commonly classed as a member of a group that also includes Craig Phadrig and Knock Farril to the west and Tap o' Noth and Dunnideer to the south east. These are characterised as massively constructed oblong forts, commonly exhibiting evidence of vitrification. The remains of the fort are now heavily mutilated and defaced and have been damaged by the building of the tower and mausoleum; by erosion from the provision of access roads; by root damage, animal burrowing and slope wash. It is traditionally believed that there was an early Christian church, possibly Culdean, on top of the hill, though no traces of this have been found. On the south side of the hill, approximately from York Tower and the summit, is a stone circle consisting of six boulders of up to in height, arranged with an overall diameter of . Hill fort The fort was surveyed by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in 1957. The innermost enclosure measured from east to west and from north to south and was marked by crestlines and boulders to the east and south, and by more conspicuous though still ruined remains of a wall to the west and north. This was contained within a second enclosure measuring by that was marked by a clear line of large facing stones along the south west. The entrance to both enclosures lay on the east, and the smaller enclosure may therefore have been a later structure built over the ruins of the larger one. A third wall surrounded both inner enclosures and was represented only by tumbled stones to the east and north, but by a more substantial scarp studded with stones and boulders to the west and south. Two outer ramparts run around the lower slopes of the hill. These were made up of rubble and earth, with the inner enclosing an area measuring from east to west and from north to south, and the outer lying further out for most of its length.

Print of the Arno Bank at Ponte alle Grazie, with three story Palazzo Del Nero in background (1744) by Giuseppe Zocchi. The general area prior to the mid 14th-century, belonged to the Bardi, Benci, Banchi, and Nasi. The latter between 1460 and 1469 consolidated their holdings into one palace. Giorgio Vasari indicated that the palace was begun under the direction of the architect Baccio d'Agnolo, and completed by his son, Domenico. Older prints of the palace note that the upper floors were part of an open loggia overlooking the River. In 1552, the palace was sold to the Del Nero family. In 1816, the palace was inherited by the Torrigiani. The rusticated stone portals, window arches, and corner pilasters, as well as the brackets of the first floor windows are characteristic of the Mannerist architecture of Baccio. The aesthetics of the building were altered with the creation of fourth floor with smoothed stone blocks, and the sealing of the third floor loggia to make further rooms. The river facade has an awkward positioning of windows relative to the other sides.

The program is produced, broadcast, and syndicated by the Sinclair Television Group. It is shown on most television stations operated by the Sinclair Broadcast Group division, initially broadcast at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time Sundays on some stations and later in the day by others. It is also streamed live-to-air on the program's website, FullMeasure.news. Topics often include coverage of government spending or action considered inappropriate. Format Full Measure is named after a line in the Gettysburg Address honoring soldiers who died fighting for the United States. The show differs from other Sunday public affairs programs because it does not utilize the common week-in-review political discussion or panel discussion formats, which Attkisson intended to avoid due to the prevalence of existing programs formatted this way. The magazine-format program instead features a mix of multiple long-form reports conducted by Attkisson and a team of correspondents ‚Äì with a focus on investigative \\"accountability journalism\\" centering on political and socioeconomic issues (including wasteful project spending by state and federal governments, political whistleblowing, and fraud and abuse of power by corporations and special interest groups). The reports featured on the program deal mainly with topical matter that Attkisson considers to be \\"untouchable topic[s]\\" by other news organizations, intended to be reported in a manner that would not be \\"steer[ed] in a [ideological] direction just to prove a point\\". Although it departs from the standard Sunday morning talk show format, Full Measure also features interviews with political figures in the news. The premiere broadcast on October 4, 2015 featured an interview conducted by Attkisson with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump). Sinclair executive David Smith met with Trump during the 2016 election year, in which he told the future president, \\"We are here to deliver your message.\\" It was part of a pitch to have reporters embedded in the Trump campaign. Production and development On April 22, 2015, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it reached an agreement with Attkisson to host a half-hour weekly Washington, D.C.-based news program that would debut on most of Sinclair's ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and CW-affiliated stations in 79 markets, including those operated by partner companies such as Deerfield Media and Cunningham Broadcasting) that fall. The creation of the Full Measure program came as Sinclair began to venture further into original programming development (having already produced a weekly program for Ring of Honor after its 2011 purchase of the wrestling promotion, as well as owning the American Sports Network syndication service, and the distribution of The Right Side with conservative commentator Armstrong Williams, who has an interest in Howard Stirk Holdings, another company close to Sinclair), a move solidified through an investment/development deal with The Tornante Company (owned by former Walt Disney Company CEO Michael Eisner) which was announced that July. Attkisson had been working as a freelance correspondent for Sinclair's Washington bureau since 2014 after she resigned as Washington, D.C. bureau correspondent for CBS News the year before, following claims detailed in her 2014 book, Stonewalled, that computers in Attkisson's CBS office were hacked and infected with spyware, and that the correspondent experienced editorial interference from CBS News management while trying to report in a manner she perceived as fair. The contentious topics related to the Obama administration, such as the investigation of the 2012 Benghazi attack and the rollout of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Attkisson had filed reports syndicated to the Sinclair group's news- producing stations for their local evening newscasts, and then she officially joined the Sinclair bureau full-time in June 2015. In announcing the program, its title, and premiere date, Sinclair Television Group vice president of news Scott Livingston stated that the program's goal is \\"to provide the context and perspective on major issues impacting our viewers\\", and he noted that Attkisson's \\"unwavering commitment to exposing government waste, abuse and impropriety will be the foundation of our news program\\". Several former CBS News production staff members were hired for the program, including its executive producer, Batt Humphreys (who formerly served as executive producer of The Early Show and as the division's director of Standards and Practices). Sinclair gave Attkisson editorial control of Full Measure, allowing it to deal with topics that may be perceived as controversial or having a political or ideological agenda. Sinclair has been criticized by some media advocacy groups in the past for its syndicated weekly conservative commentary segments hosted by company vice president Mark Hyman since 2003, and has produced programs critical of Democratic candidates in past presidential elections.

The character was introduced in the ninth series episode \\"The Girl Who Died\\", before making a few more appearances during the series. Appearances Ashildr, daughter of Einarr (Ian Conningham), is introduced in \\"The Girl Who Died\\" (2015), where she is portrayed as a Viking puppet maker and storyteller. When the militaristic alien race the Mire raid her village, Ashildr declares war between the village and ten of the Mire. As part of a battle plan devised by the alien time traveller the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), Ashildr uses the technology inside one of the Mire's helmets to create an illusion to scare the Mire into a retreat. In doing so, she dies of heart failure, having been \\"used... up like a battery\\" by being connected to the Mire's machine. The Doctor's companion, Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), a time-travelling school teacher from 21st century England, persuades the Doctor to save her. He implants Ashildr with Mire medical technology, bringing her back to life and making her functionally immortal, but he worries that there will be consequences. He also gives her another piece of the same technology that brought her back to life before leaving. In the following episode \\"The Woman Who Lived\\", the Doctor catches up with Ashildr in 1651 England after 800 years have passed for her. She has become a highwayman, adopting the new name of \\"Me\\". While her body has become immortal, the human brain is physically insufficient to contain 800 years' worth of memories, which has totally altered her personality: she has lived many lives under different personas, loved and lost many people, most of whom she can't even remember clearly anymore. The only constant that remained was herself, leading to her developing the new name \\"Me\\" to refer to herself - along with a cynical and self-absorbed attitude that she is the only thing that matters, because everyone else she encounters is transient. Having lived through many wars and suffered many losses, she plans to travel the galaxy with an alien Leonian called Leandro (Ariyon Bakare) after the Doctor helps her retrieve an amulet called the Eyes of Hades, not knowing this will create a portal using the death of rival highwayman Sam Swift the Quick (Rufus Hound). However, Leandro betrays Ashildr and, instead, summons a fleet of ships to attack Earth. Ashildr uses her spare piece of Mire medical technology to restore Sam's life and close the portal to Leandro's world. She promises the Doctor that she will watch over his companions on Earth, keeping them safe after they stop traveling with him. Shortly afterward, he spots her in the background of a photo on Clara's mobile phone taken in the 21st century. When the Doctor next encounters Ashildr in \\"Face the Raven\\", she runs an alien refugee camp hidden in the heart of 21st century London, having lured the Doctor in using Rigsy (Joivan Wade), an old acquaintance of his, as bait. In a reckless attempt at subverting Ashildr's plan, Clara takes on the death sentence given to Rigsy to buy more time, without realising that Ashildr cannot remove it once it is transferred to a new recipient. A now-remorseful Ashildr takes the Doctor's TARDIS key, and teleports him to her collaborators, which was the plan all along, who are revealed in \\"Hell Bent\\" to be the Doctor's own race: the Time Lords. Before \\"Hell Bent\\", in \\"Heaven Sent\\", the Doctor mentions that Ashildr/\\"Me\\" is going to destroy Gallifrey, because she's the \\"hybrid\\", echoing a prophecy related by Davros in \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" / \\"The Witch's Familiar\\". In the ninth series finale \\"Hell Bent\\", the Doctor attempts to help Clara cheat death and runs away with her to the planet Gallifrey at the end of time itself, where Ashildr remains the last being in existence (how she got to Gallifrey and how much time has passed from her perspective is not revealed). She counsels the Doctor to stop his current course of action, for the sake of the universe, and so the Doctor and Clara submit themselves to have one of them wiped of their memories. The Doctor loses his memories of Clara, who returns him to Earth and reunites him with his TARDIS but departs with Ashildr for adventures of their own in a newly acquired TARDIS of their own. Clara promises Ashildr she will return to Gallifrey to face her death as history records, but not before seeing the universe in more depth first. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going the long way round.‚Äù Casting and development Head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat said about having Williams on Doctor Who, \\"We're thrilled to have Maisie Williams joining us on Doctor Who. It's not possible to say too much about who or what she's playing, but she is going to challenge the Doctor in very unexpected ways. This time he might just be out of his depth, and we know Maisie is going to give him exactly the right sort of hell.\\" Maisie Williams said about her role in Doctor Who, \\"I'm so excited to be working on Doctor Who as it's such a big and important part of British Culture. I can't wait to meet the cast and crew and start filming, especially as we'll be shooting not too far from my home town.\\" When speaking about being in Doctor Who, Williams said, \\"People say 'don't meet your idols as they never turn out to be who you want them to be'. That was completely not the case with Peter and he's been wonderful and really helpful on set\\" about Peter Capaldi. In 2016, Williams confirmed that she will not return to Doctor Who. The following year she clarified that there is no reason she couldn't come back in the future, she simply wasn't actively seeking it, and she hadn't been asked to return either. Reception When talking about the episode \\"The Girl Who Died\\", Mike Reyes of Cinema Blend said about Ashildr that \\"Sure enough, Ashildr's death and rebirth after fighting the Mire went from a happy ending to an ending that gave me pause. The Doctor has now officially created a functional immortal out of a normal human, and given how he's held up with such a life span, it looks like things are about to get scary.\\" Sam Warner of Digital Spy reported that \\"Opinion was mostly positive, though Ashildr hasn't convinced everyone just yet\\" when talking about the character's debut appearance. Williams described her role in Doctor Who as \\"every fan-boy's dream\\". Liz Raftery of TV Guide described Williams' role as \\"highly anticipated\\" and Williams then went on to explain \\"When you cross over to a different geeky fandom world, everyone's like, 'This is insane!'\\" In a review for the episode \\"The Girl Who Died\\", Williams' portrayal of Ashildr is described by Rob Smedley of the website CultBox as \\"envied natural talent that ... lifts Ashildr above being convenience or novelty\\". Reviewing the episode \\"The Woman Who Lived\\", Smedley discussed Williams' portrayal of Ashildr as \\"a terrific job of making the character feel like she‚Äôs lived lifetimes since we last saw her. Several hundred years of loss in just one week. It‚Äôs an even better, and inevitably more mature, performance than last Saturday.\\"  Notes  References External links *Ashildr at the BBC One Doctor Who website Category:Recurring characters in Doctor Who Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional Vikings Category:Fictional mayors Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Fictional post- classical people Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Fictional extraterrestrial‚Äìhuman hybrids Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors ","title":"Ashildr"},{"id":"48273470","text":"Aristotelia aphromorpha is a moth of the family Gelechiidae.
