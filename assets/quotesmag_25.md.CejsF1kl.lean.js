Plot Based on a description in a film publication, Mary Smith (Clark) gives a party in her college room when John Chiverick (Bunker) is found in attendance. Because he has \\"compromised\\" her, John feels obligated to marry Mary. Immediately after the ceremony, Mary's father (Washburn) has the marriage annulled and sends Mary abroad. After two years she returns and sees her former husband at a Long Island house party. There is much concern about the disgrace that would be caused if her marriage annulment were to become public knowledge. Larry McCleod (Gendron) is at the party and is in love with Mary, although he believes that she is a widow. She accepts his proposal after confessing her situation.

It was investigated for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in phase II clinical trials, and also showed an unacceptable incidence rate and severity of side effects (e.g., breast pain and gynecomastia). As such, it was not further developed. Zanoterone was derived from 5Œ±-dihydroethisterone (5Œ±-dihydro-17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone). It is an antagonist of the androgen receptor (Ki = 2.2 ŒºM; compared to metribolone = 2.2%), and with the exception of antiprogestogenic activity in rat and rabbit models, is devoid of other hormonal activities. Zanoterone does not inhibit 5Œ±-reductase, aromatase, or 3Œ±- or 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in vitro. The drug significantly increases testosterone and estradiol levels in men. Zanoterone has been found to not significantly inhibit mating performance or fertility in adult male rats at high dosages for an extended period of time.

Its previous location at 31 W. 57th Street was noted for its beautiful interior. After Rizzoli's lease expired in April 2014, the 57th St. building was demolished. Rizzoli moved to its current NoMad location on July 27, 2015. The Rizzoli Bookstore is indirectly owned by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore an Italian multimedia company, having acquired the books division from RCS MediaGroup. The direct parent company of the bookstore is Rizzoli International Publications, also known as Rizzoli New York.  History  In 1964, Angelo Rizzoli opened Rizzoli Bookstore at 712 Fifth Avenue in New York City; the building designed by Albert S. Gottlieb in 1907 and inspired by the classical style of 19th century Parisian town houses. Angelo Rizzoli chose architect Ferdinand Gottlieb (no relation to Albert) to design the interiors. The Rizzoli store attracted legions of customers with its \\"marble floors, oak paneling, sparkling chandeliers.\\" Gianfranco Monacelli, who went on to become the president and chief executive of Rizzoli Publications before creating Monacelli Press in 1994, started as a night clerk in the Fifth Avenue store in 1965. In the 1960s, Roberto Polo, investment manager, art collector, and would-be design mogul worked part-time at Rizzoli while a graduate student at Columbia. As the director of the Rizzoli Gallery, he organized an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúFashion as Fantasy.‚Äù In 1976, Rizzoli opened a store in Chicago's Water Tower Place. Additional stores later opened in Boston, Massachusetts; Costa Mesa, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Pasadena, and San Francisco, California; Dallas, Texas; Oak Brook, Illinois; Atlanta, Georgia; Washington, D.C.; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1984, Rizzoli acquired Scribner's Bookstore on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and opened an additional store in SoHo. The Scribner‚Äôs flagship store on Fifth Avenue continued to operate under Rizzoli ownership until 1989, when it closed. In 1985, Rizzoli Bookstore relocated to West 57th Street. The old Rizzoli building and the Coty Building next door were slated to be demolished for a new skyscraper at 712 Fifth Avenue, but were saved at the last minute when they were designated as official city landmarks. The new store occupied three floors of the former Sohmer Piano Company showroom and was renovated by H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture. Rizzoli closed most of its national locations except for its flagship store in 2001. In 2010, Rizzoli Bookstore opened a boutique store in the Italian food megastore Eataly, featuring nearly 400 titles related to food and drink. In 2012, a similar store opened in Saks Fifth Avenue, featuring a curated selection of books on fashion, design, entertaining, interiors, special travel destinations and New York. \\"World's Most Elegant In-Store Bookstore?

On April 11, 2014, Rizzoli closed its flagship store on West 57th Street in New York, under the protest of customers and preservationists, when its lease expired. The LeFrak Organization and Vornado Realty Trust, which had owned the building since 2006, planned to raze it and two adjoining buildings. Demolition started shortly after the bookstore closed. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had refused to warrant landmark status for the building, noting that the interior design dated only to 1985 and that there was not enough original substance from the 1919 building left. The decision and the way the decision was made by the Landmarks Preservation Commission was criticized by the editorial board of the New York Times. Rizzoli reopened at its current Broadway location in July 2015. In 2015 Arnoldo Mondadori Editore acquired the parent divisions RCS Libri and Rizzoli International Publications from RCS MediaGroup. In 2016, the RCS Libri was dismantled by the new owner, which Rizzoli International Publications and Rizzoli Bookstore were owned by Mondadori Electa S.p.A., another subsidiary of the group instead.  In popular culture  Rizzoli Bookstore has been used as a prominent location in the films Falling in Love (1984), Manhattan (1979), and True Story (2015), in addition to television series such as Seinfeld.

She was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Michigan State University in 2003. Career During and subsequent to her PhD research, Beilock explored differences between novice and expert athletic performances. Later in her career, Beilock's research focused on why people perform poorly in stressful academic situations, such as taking a high-stakes mathematics exam. Beilock found that worries during those situations rob individuals of the working memory or cognitive horsepower they would normally have to focus. Because people with more working memory rely on their brainpower more, they can be affected to a greater extent in stressful academic situations. Beilock's work demonstrated that stressful situations during tests might diminish meaningful differences between students that, under less-stressful situations, might exhibit greater differences in performance. From 2003 to 2005, Beilock was an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Miami University. She was on the faculty at The University of Chicago from 2005 until 2017, where she was the Stella M.

Although she was a turbine steamship, she tended not to be referred to as \\"TSS\\". She was built in Vlissingen in the Netherlands in 1924 for liner service between Rotterdam and the Dutch East Indies. In 1940 she was converted into a troop ship. In 1941 she was sunk with great loss of life in the Battle of Greece. Building and peacetime service Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde built Slamat in Vlissingen on the River Scheldt, completing her in 1924. Her boilers had oil- burning furnaces, and her engines were steam turbines that drove her twin screws via double reduction gearing. She was equipped with submarine signalling apparatus, which in the 1920s was seen as an alternative to radio. She also had wireless direction finding equipment. Slamat was built for Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd (KRL or \\"Royal Dutch Lloyd\\") and managed by Willem Ruys en Zonen. Willem Ruys ran KRL and the two companies were part of the same group. KRL ships operated passenger and cargo services between Rotterdam and the Dutch East Indies via Southampton, Marseille and the Suez Canal. Slamat was KRL's last major steam turbine passenger liner before it started introducing motor ships: Indrapoera in 1925, Sibajak in 1927 and the larger and swifter Baloeran and Dempo in 1929. In 1931 Slamat was refitted and lengthened by , which slightly increased each of her tonnages. Her speed was increased to . In peacetime Slamat carried KRL's livery of dove-grey hull, white superstructure and black funnels. War service When the Second World War began the Netherlands was neutral. In mid-October 1939 Slamat left Rotterdam for the East Indies, calling at Lisbon, Cape Verde, Cape Town, Mauritius, Sabang and Singapore before reaching Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies, on 30 November. On 1 December she left Batavia for Italy, which was also still neutral. She called at Sabang, Aden and Port Said before arriving on 21 December in Genoa, where she spent Christmas 1939 and New Year 1940. She left Genoa on 10 January for the East Indies, calling at Suez, Aden and Sabang before reaching Batavia on 1 February. In May 1940 Germany conquered the Netherlands in one week and the Dutch monarchy and government evacuated to London. Germany captured KRL's managing director Willem Ruys, and the company transferred the registration of its ships including Slamat from Rotterdam to Batavia. KRL's diesel ship Indrapoera, which sailed with Slamat on several troop-carrying voyages in 1940‚Äì41 On 6 July KRL's Indrapoera left Batavia for Surabaya in eastern Java, and on the 19th Slamat followed her. Then the two liners sailed to the Philippines, which were then neutral. Indrapoera sailed ahead, leaving Surabaya on 26 July and reaching Manila on the 31st. Slamat followed three days behind her, reaching Manila on 3 August. By then Indrapoera had already left for Australia, and the next day Slamat followed. Each liner called at Thursday Island, Queensland before reaching Sydney Harbour, Indrapoera on 13 August and Slamat on the 17th. There they joined two other Dutch ocean liners; Stoomvaart-Maatschappij Nederland's Christiaan Huygens and Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij's Nieuw Holland, which between them embarked 4,315 Australian troops. On 12 September the Dutch ships left Sydney for Fremantle in Western Australia, where they formed Convoy US 5, which left Fremantle on 22 September and reached Suez on 12 October. Indrapoera and Slamat continued through the Suez Canal, called at Port Said and on 17 October reached Haifa in Palestine. In September 1940 Italy invaded Egypt, where British and Empire forces now needed reinforcement from the Dominions and Empire. From now on a number of Dutch troop ships concentrated on bringing British Empire troops across the Indian Ocean to the Near East. Indrapoera and Slamat left Haifa on 21 October, reached Port Said the next day, and then passed through the Suez Canal. For the next six months the two KRL ships operated in the Indian Ocean, bringing British Empire troops from India and Ceylon to Egypt. Indrapoera and Slamat spent Christmas 1940 and New Year 1941 in Bombay. On 14 January 1941 they reached Colombo to take part in Convoy US 8 to Suez. This was a huge troop movement: seven British and five Dutch troop ships, accompanied by two British cargo ships. The other Dutch ships were Christiaan Huygens, SMN's Johan de Witt and KPM's Nieuw Zeeland. Among the British ships was Shaw, Savill & Albion Line's flagship , which at was the largest liner in the Indian Ocean. US 8 left Colombo on 16 January and reached Suez on the 28th. After US 8, Indrapoera and Slamat continued to operate in the Indian Ocean until April 1941. Then Indrapoera headed via Durban to the Caribbean and United States, but Slamat returned to the Mediterranean. Convoy to and from Nauplia In April 1941 Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. After 10 days of fierce fighting the British Empire started to plan the evacuation of 60,000 troops from Greece. Slamat had been spending the month making shuttle trips between Suez and Port Sudan, but by 23 April she was in the Mediterranean Sea and on the 24th she was in Convoy AG 14 from Alexandria to Greece. When the convoy reached Greek waters, it split to reach different embarkation points. Slamat and another troop ship, the British-India Line-managed , were ordered with the cruiser and a number of destroyers to Nauplia and Tolon on the Argolic Gulf in the eastern Peloponnese. Before their arrival another troopship had grounded in Nauplia Bay, blocking ship access to the port. An air attack had turned her into a total loss. Ships would now have to anchor in the bay, where boats would bring troops out to them from the shore. En route to Nauplia Slamats group of ships was bombed and her superstructure was heavily damaged. patrolled against submarines off Nauplia, rescued survivors from Slamat, but was then sunk by aircraft. On the evening of 26 April three cruisers, four destroyers and Khedive Ismail and Slamat were in the Bay of Nauplia. The only available tenders were one landing craft, local ca√Øques and the ships' own boats. Two cruisers and two destroyers embarked nearly 2,500 troops, but the slow rate of embarkation meant that Khedive Ismail did not get its turn and did not embark any. At 0300 hrs Calcutta ordered all ships to sail, but Slamat disobeyed and continued embarking troops. Calcutta and Khedive Ismail sailed at 0400 hrs; Slamat followed at 0415 hrs, by which time she had embarked about 500 troops: about half her capacity. =Loss of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck= The convoy steamed south down the Argolic Gulf, until at 0645 or 0715 hrs Luftwaffe aircraft attacked it: first Bf 109 fighters, then Ju 87 dive bombers and Ju 88 and Do 17 bombers. A bomb exploded between Slamats bridge and forward funnel, setting her afire. Her water system became disabled, hampering her crew's ability to fight the fire. Another bomb also hit her and she listed to starboard. Slamats Master, Tjalling Luidinga, gave the order to abandon ship. The bombing and fire had destroyed some of her lifeboats and life rafts, and her remaining boats and rafts were launched under a second Stuka attack. The destroyer reported seeing four bombs hit Slamat. Two lifeboats capsized; one from overloading and another when, in the midst of transferring survivors, Diamond had to speed away from her to evade an air attack. Some aircraft machine-gunned survivors in the water. came to Diamonds aid, rescued survivors from Slamat but was then sunk along with Diamond. The rest of the convoy kept moving, while Calcutta rescued some survivors and ordered the destroyer Diamond to rescue more. At 0815 hrs Diamond was still rescuing survivors and still under attack. At 0916 hrs three destroyers from Crete reinforced the convoy, so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. At 0925 hrs Diamond reported that she had rescued most of the survivors and was heading for Souda Bay. Wryneck reached Diamond about 1000 hrs and requested aircraft cover at 1025 hrs. Diamond accompanied by Wryneck returned to Slamat, arriving about 1100 hrs. They found two lifeboats from Slamat and rescued their occupants. Slamat was afire from stem to stern, and Diamond fired a torpedo at her port side that sank her in a coup de gr√¢ce. By now Diamond carried about 600 of Slamats survivors, including Captain Luidinga. About 1315 hrs a Staffel of Ju 87 bombers came out of the sun in a surprise attack on the two destroyers. Two bombs damaged Diamond, destroyed both of her lifeboats and sank her in eight minutes. Three bombs hit Wryneck; she capsized to port and sank in 10‚Äì15 minutes. Wryneck launched her whaler and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Several men in the Carley floats died either from wounds or from drowning in the swell. =Rescues and casualties= Wrynecks Commissioned Engineer, Maurice Waldron, took command of her whaler and she set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats to strike the boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift. rescued survivors from Wryneck and Diamond, some of whom were survivors from Slamat. She later took the survivors from Souda Bay to Port Said. After 1900 hrs on 27 April the Vice Admiral, Light Forces, Henry Pridham-Wippell, became concerned that Diamond had not returned to Souda Bay and was not answering radio signals. Wryneck had been ordered to keep radio silence so no attempt was made to radio her. Pridham-Wippell sent the destroyer to the position where Slamat had been lost. She found 14 survivors in two Carley floats that night, more floats and another four survivors in the morning, and took the survivors to Crete. The last living survivor from Slamat, Royal Army Service Corps veteran George Dexter, states that after Wryneck was sunk he and three other men were rescued by the cruiser . Survivors in Wrynecks whaler reached Crete in three stages. On 28 April they aimed for the island of Milos in the Aegean Sea, but were too exhausted so they landed at Ananes Rock, about southeast of Milos. There they met a ca√Øque full of Greek refugees and British soldiers evacuated from Piraeus, who were sheltering by day and sailing only by night to avoid detection. In the evening everyone left Ananes and headed south for Crete, with most people in the ca√Øque and five being towed in the whaler. On 29 April the ca√Øque sighted a small landing craft that had left Porto Rafti near Athens. She took aboard everyone from the ca√Øque and whaler, and the next day they reached Souda Bay. Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the loss of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck. Of the 500 or so soldiers that Slamat embarked, eight survived. Of her complement of 193 crew and 21 Australian and New Zealand DEMS gunners and NZEF Medical Corps, 11 survived. Of Diamonds 166 complement, 20 survived. Of Wrynecks 106 crew, 27 survived. Monuments In August 1946 Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wrote to Captain Luidinga's widow, expressing her sympathy for her husband's death, gratitude for his war service and commending him as een groot zoon van ons zeevarend volk (\\"a great son of our seafaring people\\"). CWGC's Phaleron War Cemetery British and Commonwealth troops and naval personnel who were lost in the sinking of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck are named on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Athens Memorial in Phaleron War Cemetery at Palaio Faliro southeast of Athens. Royal Navy personnel are also commemorated in Britain on the Royal Navy monuments at Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth. George Dexter commissioned a monument to all the service personnel lost when the three ships were sunk. It is in The Royal British Legion Club, Shard End, Birmingham. In 2011 a monument commemorating victims from all three ships was made by the Dutch sculptor Nicolas van Ronkenstein. It was installed in the Sint-Laurenskerk (\\"St Lawrence Church\\"), Rotterdam and formally unveiled on the 70th anniversary of the disaster, 27 April. On 27 June 2012 the current hosted a wreath-laying ceremony at the position where Slamat was sunk. Participants included Diamonds commander, descendants of some of the dead from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and the Commander in Chief of the Hellenic Navy.

Originally called One Riverview and later 1 Rector Street, there was a groundbreaking in 2013, but construction did not begin at the site until the spring of 2017. It was topped out in April 2018 and opened June 2019. Location 50 Rector Park is adjacent to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) and next to the center's education facility at 24 Rector Street in Downtown Newark. It is near McCarter Highway, across from which is Newark Riverfront Park on the Passaic River. The NJPAC-Center Street station of the Newark Light Rail is a block away; Newark Penn Station is a few short blocks away. The building is seen as a major boost to the Newark's Living Downtown Plan, an effort to create transform Downtown from a 9‚Äì5 work place to a vibrant 24/7 community. It is one of several residential projects slated for the area around a renovated Military Park and nearby Washington Park. Other projects include the adaptive re-use of the American Insurance Company Building, the former flagship department store of Hahne and Company, the New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building, and the new construction of One Theater Square, among others. Design The complex was originally planned to incorporate an historic six-story building that was once part of Ballantine Brewery. It was later used by the University of Newark then two years later the NJ Law School joined, becoming Rutgers School of Law and until 2006 the city's Science High School. A new 26-story high-rise was to be built adjacent to it, incorporating the landmark, but the brewery/school building was eventually demolished. The new building has 169 rental units and 7,640 square feet of ground floor retail space as well 117 tenant parking spaces. Developers 50 Rector Park is a collaboration by Newark native Shaquille O'Neal and New Brunswick-based Boraie Development. The project received a New Jersey Economic Development Authority Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit and the Municipal Council of Newark adopted a resolution for $5 million tax credit in February 2013. Goldman Sachs has provided financing, while Newark-based Prudential Financial bought re-development area bonds issued by the city. The One Riverview project initiated work in September 2013. O'Neal has stated that he plans to move into the top floor when the tower is completed and that he would then like his \\"mother to come back here and just smile\\".

In 1951, in the priorship of Archimandrite Nikodemos Thomas, the Monastery was restored from the beginning and many new chapels (Saint Archangel Michael, Holy martyr Polycarpus, Saint Varvara, Saint George and Assumption of the Virgin, Venerable Eiriny Chrysovalantou, Saint Nectarios, Saint Vasil and Saint Demetrios) were built. A new building contains large guest rooms which can offer hospitality to over one hundred worshippers. Only one part of the east aisle of the old building of the Monastery is preserved. Of particular interest is the chapel of Saint Charalampos, that firstly was the cell of Saint David, where he stayed every Saturday.

Burgundian fibulae are a highlight of the treasury. In total, the treasury contains sixteen of these rare pieces of jewelry from the fourteenth century. The Essen Cathedral Treasury (German: Essener Domschatz) is one of the most significant collections of religious artworks in Germany. A great number of items of treasure are accessible to the public in the treasury chamber of Essen Minster. The cathedral chapter manages the treasury chamber, not as a museum as in some places, but as the place in which liturgical implements and objects are kept, which continued to be used to this day in the service of God, so far as their conservation requirements allow.Website of the Treasury.  History  The Cathedral Treasury derives from the treasury of the former Canonesses of Essen, which passed to St Johann Baptist after the secularisation of the order in 1803. During the Ruhr Uprising in 1920, the entire treasury was smuggled out to Hildesheim in secret, from which it was returned in 1925.Lydia Konnegen, Verborgene Sch√§tze. Der Essener M√ºnsterschatz in Zeiten des Ruhrkampfes, in Das M√ºnster am Hellweg 58, 2005, pp. 67‚Äì81. During the Second World War the Treasury was taken first to Warstein, then to Albrechtsburg in Meissen and from there to Siegen, where it was sealed in Hain tunnel to protect it from aerial bombing. After the end of the war it was found there by American troops and brought to the State Museum in Marburg, and later to a collection of displaced artworks in Schloss Dyck, Rheydt. From April to October 1949, the Essen Cathedral Treasury was displayed in Brussels and Amsterdam and after that it was brought back to Essen. In 1953 the Treasure was displayed in an exhibition in the Villa H√ºgel.Museum Folkwang Essen zeigt in Villa H√ºgel Kunstwerke aus Kirchen-, Museums- und Privatbesitz: Essener M√ºnsterschatz; Wandteppiche der Sammlung Krupp; Gem√§lde, Skulpturen alter und neuer Meister; vom 10. Mai bis 30. September 1953. Essen 1953. In 1957 the Treasure became the property of the then newly established Diocese of Essen. The Treasury Chamber was first made accessible to the public without charge in 1958 at the wish of the first Bishop of Essen, Franz Hengsbach. The Treasury had to be closed from 15 September 2008 until 15 May 2009 for a structural extension. The Treasure was displayed as the opening exhibit of the Ruhr Museum in the former coal washery of the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex from 20 October 2008 until 8 February 2009 with the tagline Gold vor Schwarz (‚ÄúGold in Black‚Äù). The new display of the Cathedral Treasure was opened on 15 May 2009, which was over seventy percent larger than the previous space and improved in line with the latest ideas in museum education.  Collection  The collection is exceptional in its completeness because only a few pieces of the Abbey's Treasure, such as the golden shrine of St Marsus have been lost in the course of time, and particularly because the liber ordinarius survives, in which the liturgical use of the objects is laid out. The Essen Cathedral Treasury contains several artistically significant works, particularly from the Ottonian period, such as: * Four processional crosses from Ottonian times: the Cross of Otto and Mathilde, the Senkshmelz Cross, the Cross of Theophanu and the Cross of Mathilde * A golden crown, which is claimed to be the Childhood Crown of Otto III, but is generally dated to the eleventh century. It is, at any rate, the oldest surviving lily crown. * The Sword of Saints Cosmas and Damian, the gold-sheathed ceremonial sword of the abesses since Ottonian times * The Theophanu Gospels, an eleventh-century manuscript with a gilt cover and carved ivory plate in the middle. * A cross- shaped reliquary for a Holy Nail, gifted by Theophanu. * The Golden Madonna, the oldest sculpture of Mary in western art (Kept in the Minster). * A two metre tall Seven-armed candelabrum from Ottonian times (Kept in the Minster) In addition to the Ottonian artworks, valuable objects from later times also belong to the Cathedral Treasury, such as the Bust of Marsus and sixteen Burgundian fibulae from the fourteenth century.Birgitta Falk, \\"Die sechzehn franz√∂sisch-burgundischen Agraffen im Essener Domschatz,\\" in Birgitta Falk, Thomas Schilp, Michael Schlagheck (edd.): ... wie das Gold den Augen leuchtet.

Resurrection of Eve was directed and written by Jon Fontana and Artie Mitchell. Though less successful commercially and critically than Behind the Green Door, it is considered one of the films of The Golden Age of Porn. Like Behind the Green Door, it featured interracial sex, including a reprise of Chambers' coupling with her Green Door co-star Johnnie Keyes, but broke new ground in a film targeting a heterosexual audience by included shots of gay fellatio. Plot Eve, a victim of childhood sexual abuse, and her lover Frank, a disc jockey, live in the San Francisco Bay Area. They have a fight triggered by Frank's jealous nature. Frank is dismayed that Eve has gone to a boxing match featuring African American pugilist Johnnie Keyes. Eve tries to console Frank with sex, but they fight and he tells her, ‚ÄúPerhaps you need some of that black stuff.‚Äù Eve leaves the house, gets into her car, and has a terrible accident whilst driving, winding up in the hospital, wrapped in bandages. After the bandages are taken off, she surprisingly is much prettier. This is her first resurrection. After Eve returns home, Frank suggests they attend a swinger's party, and she reluctantly agrees. At the ensuing orgy, Frank happily enjoys the charms of a friend's wife, but Eve is horrified by the hedonism and they fight afterwards. Frank berates her for harboring sexual inhibitions and blamed for trying to make him feel guilty. The brow-beaten Eve decides to try swinging again. After attending a couple more swing parties, a role-reversal begins to take place. Eve becomes an enthusiastic swinger, and Frank's jealousy comes out at a party in a 1950s themed party in which he sees his wife fellating an African American. Frank becomes the reticent partner as Eve becomes unfettered sexuality, and he loses his control over her. At an orgy featuring all manners of sex, gay, straight and interracial, Eve couples with an African American gentleman while the jealous Frank watches. She announces after coitus that she is leaving Frank. The second resurrection of Eve is complete. Themes Resurrection of Eve has a more detailed plot than is normal for the era. The film touches on issues of sexual politics and race- based sexual envy. There is less sex than would be expected from the Mitchell Brothers, after viewing Behind the Green Door, a basically plotless sextravaganza. The Supreme Court's 1973 Miller v. California decision, which was decided on 21 June 1973, adversely affected the mainstream release of porn films, including Behind the Green Door. The Miller decision redefined obscenity from that of ‚Äúutterly without socially redeeming value‚Äù to that that lacks \\"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\" and substituted contemporary community standards for national standards, as some prior tests required. Miller continued to hold that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment, which gave leeway to local judges to seize and destroy prints of films adjudged to violate local community standards. When Behind the Green Door opened in Suffolk County, New York in 1973, it was successfully prosecuted, as it was in New York City along with the 1973 porn film The New Comers. In addition to New York, Behind the Green Door was banned in California, Colorado, and Georgia.

C. lacustris us an herbaceous surface-piercing plant that grows in water up to deep, and grows tall. It grows well in marshes and swampy woods of the boreal forest, along river and lake shores, in ditches, marshes, swamps, and other wetland habitat. It grows on muck, sedge peat, wet sand or silt, in filtered or full sunlight. It's a common sedge that dominates many native wetlands, or intermixes with other sedges and grasses, and its ability to spread by rhizomes makes it a good colonizer for a large area. Common names In addition to lake sedge, other non-scientific names include common lake sedge, lakebank or lake-bank sedge, hairy sedge, and rip-gut sedge. Its common name in French is carex lacustre. The common name should not be confused with lakeshore sedge (Carex lenticularis).  Description  Stems are typically tall. Stems are rough to the touch, and have a triangular cross section, most distinctly near the base. They are green with a conspicuously reddish to purplish tinge at the base. Leaf blades are grayish blue to dark green, grow as long or longer than the stems, and are 8‚Äì20 mm wide. They are coarse, and their cross-section is distinctly M-shaped. The sheaths around the stem are smooth, and basal (near the base) sheaths are reddened and have open, feather-like (pinnate) fibers. Flowers on C. lacustris occur along spikes or spikelets, an elongated, tightly-packed type of inflorescence (flower cluster) that contain many small florets. Plants typically have 4‚Äì8 green spikes, 2‚Äì4 upper spikes that are male (staminate spikes), and 2‚Äì4 lower spikes that are female (pistillate spikes). The male spikes are narrow, 3‚Äì4 mm wide, 1‚Äì8 cm long, and are short- lived. The female spikes are thick, 10‚Äì15 mm wide, and 2‚Äì10 cm long, either sessile (stalkless) or on short stalks, with 50‚Äì100 well-separated florets. Spikes are generally erect, with lower spikes sometimes nodding, and they are sometimes compound. The olive-green perigynium is 5.5‚Äì7.3 mm long, hairless, distinctly ribbed, and gradually tapers into a beak. Thin female scales are ovate (tapered at tip) and awned, translucent to purplish or brown in color, and half the length of the perigynia. The fruit or nutlet is a three-sided achene with three stigmas. Carex lacustris has a similar habitat and appearance to Carex atherodes, known as slough sedge or awned sedge, but C. atherodes typically have hairy leaf sheaths rather than smooth, and it has longer teeth (1.5‚Äì3 mm) on its parigynia.  Habitat  C. lacustris is found in shallow marshes, marsh edges, shrub-carrs, alder thickets, wet and open thickets, open swamps, wooded swamps, sedge meadows, ditches, and borders of lakes, ponds, bogs, fens, and streams. It forms scattered clones or beds, and sometimes extensive stands are seen without fertile culms It is abundant and often a dominant plant of calcareous, north-temperate wetlands. The species typically fruits from May to July. = Planting = C. lacrustris can reproduce from seeds, from rhizome runners, or from shoots. It does not naturally reestablish well in isolated wetlands restoration, likely due to limited water-borne seed dispersal. It benefits from well-planned restorations with an aim of dense stands to preempt undesired aggressive species. Seeds should be stored in wet, dark, cold (4 ¬∞C) conditions for optimal germination rates. Recommended conditions for germination in a controlled environment are a cyclic diurnal temperature variation between 20 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C.  Range  Native to the US and Canada, almost always occurring in wetlands.

Variants  The proposed variant Carex lacustris var. laxiflora (Dewey) is not accepted by ITIS, and is considered a synonym of Carex hyalinolepis Steud. (shoreline sedge). The proposed variant Carex lacustra var. gigantea is also not accepted, considered is a synonym of Carex gigantea (giant sedge).  Hybrids  Rare natural hybrids of C. lacustris are known to occur with C. trichocarpa, C. hyalinolepis, C. pellita, and C. utriculata. The hybrids show morphological traits of both parents, and while infertile, can form extensive clones. The chromosome number of the hybrid parents do not need to be the same.  Conservation status  The species has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List. (Search for carex lacustris to verify non-assessment). NatureServe ranks the species global conservation status as G5 (secure - very low risk of extinction or elimination). Its national rank in Canada is N5 (secure), and NNR (not ranked) in the United States, though some individual states are ranked, ranging from imperiled on the fringes of the species' range to secure nearer the center. The species is listed as \\"Threatened\\" by the states of Maryland and Tennessee, both near the southern edge of its known range.  Wildlife use  Carex lacustris attracts waterfowl and songbirds, which eat its seeds, and butterflies, including the endangered Dukes' skipper, whose larvae feed exclusively on C. lacustris in the northern part of its Michigan range. Rodents and other small animals use stems as shelter and food in the winter. Pike and muskies use the plants as spawning habitat in the spring.

Penrod is perpetually in trouble at school and in the neighborhood because of the pranks he plays. Georgie Bassett and Rodney Bitts, two other boys at school, are always complaining to adults about Penrod and Sam, so the boys will not allow them into their club. When Georgie's father, Mr. Bassett, tells this to Penrod's father, Henry Schofield, Mr. Schofield insists that the boys invite Georgie to join their club. Having been forced into accepting Georgie, they decide to make his initiation especially unpleasant. Rodney, who also dislikes the boys, then pretends that Penrod and Sam harmed him, and the two boys are unfairly punished. Meanwhile, Penrod and Sam argue over a girl, Marjorie Jones, whom they both like, and Penrod's dog, Duke, is run over by a car. Penrod hits his lowest period when Penrod's father sells the empty lot where the clubhouse is located to Mr. Bitts, who throws the boys off the land. Out of revenge, Rodney even refuses to allow Penrod to visit Duke's grave next to the clubhouse. When he realizes how much the lot means to Penrod, Mr. Schofield buys the land back from Mr. Bitts, and having learned his lesson, Penrod makes up with Sam and invites Rodney to join the club.

She became famous due to the photo taken by Juan Guzm√°n on the rooftop of Pla√ßa de Catalunya 9, 08002 Barcelona, Catalonia, Barcelona during the July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona. It is one of the most iconic photographs of the Spanish Civil War.  Life  Ginest√† was born in Toulouse, on 29 January 1919, into a working-class leftist family that had emigrated to France from Spain. Her parents were both tailors: Empar Coloma Chalmeta, from Valencia, and Bruno Ginest√† Manubens, from Manresa. She moved to Barcelona with her parents at the age of 11. Ginest√† later joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. As the war broke out, she served as a reporter and a translator assisting Mikhail Koltsov, a correspondent of the Soviet newspaper Pravda. Before the end of the war, Ginest√† was wounded and evacuated to Montpellier. As France was occupied by the Nazis, she fled to the Dominican Republic where she married. In 1946, she was forced to leave the country because of the persecution by the dictator Rafael Trujillo. In 1952, Ginest√† married a Belgian diplomat and returned to Barcelona. She moved to Paris in 1978. Marina Ginest√† died there at the age of 94 in January 2014.  The Photograph  The famous photograph was taken on 21 July 1936. It shows the 17-year-old girl posing with a rifle on the top of the original Hotel Col√≥n. Because she was a reporter, it was the only time Ginest√† had carried a gun. The picture was later used on the cover of the book Las Trece Rosas by Carlos Fonseca. The hotel was destroyed after the war and the site is now occupied by the Banco Espa√±ol de Cr√©dito building.

Spain took control of the region after defeating France in the Seven Years' War in 1764. France regained control in 1800, but sold it to the United States three years later in the Louisiana Purchase. St. Louis grew quickly in the 19th century, becoming America's fourth-largest city by 1904, when it hosted the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and the Summer Olympics.Niderost, Eric. \\"St. Louis Gateway to the Great Beyond.\\" Wild West 14.1 (2001): 42.

St. Louis cuisine  A number of foods are specific to, or known to have originated in St. Louis. = St. Louis-style pizza = St. Louis has a variation of pizza known as St. Louis- style pizza, which features provel cheese, a very thin crust, and is often square cut. = Gooey butter cake = A slice of gooey butter cake, garnished with powdered sugar and raspberries Gooey butter cake is a type of cake traditionally made in, and invented in, St. Louis. It is served locally as a breakfast pastry, though also served as a dessert. = Toasted ravioli = The Hill Toasted ravioli may have originated in Sicily, where fried ravioli containing a sweet filling is a traditional Christmas time dish, commonly referred to as \\"meat pillows\\".An article by Linda Cicero (\\"Cook's Corner: Meet me in St. Louis for \`toasted' ravioli\\") in the 2007-02-07 Miami Herald observed that Linda Stradley's book, I'll Have What They're Having; Legendary Local Cuisine (2002) states that St. Louis is \\"the only city in the United States to produce this\\". According to Cicero, Stradley says that toasted ravioli is popular around Christmas. However, most accounts of the first toasted ravioli can be traced to the Italian neighborhood, known as \\"The Hill\\", of St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. Many claims have been made as to the original creation of toasted ravioli in the United States. One account attributes it to Oldani's in St. Louis. The restaurant was located where Mama's \\"On The Hill\\" restaurant is now, on the St. Louis Hill at 2132 Edwards Street. As the story goes, the delicacy was stumbled upon when a ravioli from wholesaler Mama Toscano's was accidentally dropped into the fryer by Chef Fritz. \\"Mickey Garagiola, older brother of Major League Baseball Hall- of-Famer Joe Garagiola, was actually at the bar during the mishap and was the first to taste the accidental treat.\\" Shortly after, the item began appearing on menus across \\"The Hill\\" neighborhood of St. Louis. Meanwhile, many chefs on The Hill stake their own claims. Another popular claim revolves around Charlie Gitto's \\"On The Hill\\" restaurant (then known as \\"Angelo's\\"). According to that tale, in 1947, a chef at Angelo's accidentally dropped the pasta into oil instead of water. = St. Louis-style barbecue and Pork Steaks = See St. Louis-style barbecue and Pork steak.

Columbia also made a Spanish-language version of this film, entitled Hombres en mi vida. Plot summary Julia Cavanaugh is a formerly rich socialite who is heavily in debt. She meets Count Ivan Karloff, a Russian con- man, whom she hopes to marry to relieve her financial problems. They get engaged and he seduces her but when he finds out that she has no money, he abandons her. Shortly afterwards, she meets a retired bootlegger named Flashy Madden, a rough type who offers to pay off her debts if she will teach him how to be a gentleman. She replies that she can only teach him how to behave like one, not how to be one, but she accepts the offer. Julia is being courted by the son of a senator and although she is uncertain, she knows that it will benefit her precarious situation and finally accepts. Just as the engagement is about to be announced, Flashy tells Julia that he is in love with someone and can she help him find the words to tell her. They perform a mock proposal together and just as Flashy is about to do it for real, she tells him about her up-coming engagement. Flashy is disappointed but wishes her well. The engagement is announced in the press and the count reads about it. He appears at Julia's apartment and attempts to blackmail her. Flashy is in an adjoining room and overhears the interchange. He tells Julia that he will take care of it and takes the money to Karloff's lodgings. An argument ensues over relinquishing indiscreet letters from Julia and Karloff pulls out a gun and is shot by Flashy in the struggle over the gun. Flashy is arrested but refuses to say anything in order to protect Julia. He does tell his defense counsel, however, and the lawyer goes to see Julia about it. Julia agrees to testify even though it will destroy her reputation. Over Flashy's protests and outbursts in court, she gives testimony about what happened. Her fianc√© is in the spectators gallery and on hearing the truth, he leaves the court and ends the engagement. Flashy is acquitted on the grounds of self-defense and is released. He decides to go to Florida and goes to say goodbye to Julia. Julia repeats the same words that Flashy had spoken to her in the mock-proposal, saying that there is a man, the greatest gentleman she has ever known, with whom she is in love and whom she doesn't know how to tell.

Their fame began with Teodora Blanco, who as a young child added decorative elements to the more utilitarian wares made by her parents. Eventually her work became noted by a foreigner who not only bought her entire production, also encouraged her to create new forms, leading to mostly human figures called ‚Äúmu√±ecas‚Äù (lit. dolls). Her form of decoration, called ‚Äúpastillaje,‚Äù was also an innovation for the area‚Äôs pottery and consists of small pieces of clay added onto the main surfaces, often covering much of the area. Teodora taught her children and although she intended that only the oldest daughter carry on her work, today three generations of the family continues making mostly decorative pottery, mostly following her work. These include Irma Garc√≠a Blanco, who have been recognized by the Fomento Cultural Banamex and Fernando F√©lix Peg√ºero Garc√≠a, who has won prizes from the Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art in New York and Premio Nacional de Cer√°mica in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. Teodora Blanco Mermaid figure by Isaura Alc√°ntara Teodora Blanco was born in Santa Mar√≠a de Atzompa, a town were pottery-making is dominated by women. Her parents were potters, mostly making ashtrays, figures of monkeys called machines and small figures of musicians. She began working with clay when she was about six years old and soon her work stood out for the addition of decorative elements on her ashtrays. Since she was young, Teodora sold her wares at the 20 de Noviembre market in the city of Oaxaca. In the 1970s, a foreigner in the market was attracted to her work and offered to buy all of her production. Shortly after, he requested more variety in her work, which led her to create the female figures she called ‚Äúmonas.‚Äù The first ones were simple, usually images of a woman with an infant or even a tourist. Over time the figures became more varied and more complicated. She eventually worked with various government agencies as well as the Rockefeller Foundation. Teodora invented the ‚Äúmu√±ecas‚Äù (lit. dolls) on which many variations have been developed. Teodora‚Äôs most characteristic pieces are large-scale, fantasy creatures, generally human with animal head or horns. Sometimes they are women doing common activities such as nursing children. They are further characterized by a type of decoration she called ‚Äúpastilaje,‚Äù superimposed small pieces of clay on the main surfaces. All of her work was created with rudimentary tools, such as a ‚Äúwheel‚Äù consisting of nothing more than an inverted bowl with a plate or comal on top. Teodora‚Äôs work made her notable by breaking away from the local pottery tradition but also enhancing it. She was invited to events such as World Crafts Council meetings in and out of Mexico and won many national and international prizes and other recognitions. Two years before her death, Nelson Rockefeller came to Oaxaca to meet her, who collected over 175 pieces of her work. Her ceramics also made her relatively wealthy by rural Oaxaca standards. However, she remained a ‚Äúcampesino‚Äù with this wealth mostly shown in the way of the purchase of farm animals. As per tradition in Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa, Teodora charged her oldest daughter with carrying on her pottery. However, she also taught her other daughter and three sons. One of these sons became a noted potter as well. The creation of mu√±ecas and use of pastillaje have become tradition in the Blanco family, especially in the work of her brother, her two daughters and one son, as well as a number of her grandchildren. Teodora died on December 23, 1980 at age 52. Luis Garc√≠a Blanco Luis Garc√≠a Blanco in the family workshop in Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa Teodora's oldest son Luis continues his mother's tradition, having been taught by her, making figures since he was six years old. Today, he works with his wife Mar√≠a Rojas de Garc√≠a, who was also taught by Teodora. He remains faithful to much of what his mother taught him, especially in pastillaje work, but he does have his own style, especially in the creation of human faces. He makes both animal and human figures as well as fantasy figures which combine elements from humans and animals, such as mermaids and persons with animal heads. One other speciality is nativity scenes. Luis also still lives in the family compound where his mother lived and worked but in a house he built for his family. Luis has exhibited his work in Mexico, the United States (San Antonio, Santa Fe and Tucson) and Europe. Luis and Mar√≠a's children have also worked with their parents and Luis is concerned about preserving the tradition. Irma Garc√≠a Blanco Irma Garcia Blanco in her workshop Irma Garc√≠a Blanco is one of Teodora‚Äôs daughters, born in Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa in 1959. Irma continues her mother‚Äôs legacy with her own large, ornate clay figures which are lively and full of detail. Irma began working with clay at the age of six, helping her mother by making small figures. Although Irma herself only finished the second grade, some of her seven children have gone onto college. Irma‚Äôs husband worked in Mexico City as a factory sales person for 27 years, commuting home on the weekends. He retired when the factory closed. Since then, Irma‚Äôs work has become the main family income and has received support from her husband. Irma is best known for continuing the creation of ornate ‚Äúmu√±ecas‚Äù started by her mother. These works are lavishly ornate, with the female figures with proportionally short torsos, sometimes having an overabundance of decorative details. They include mermaids and women selling in the market. Some of the figures are surrounded by small animals such as dogs and rabbits, others are covered in flowers. Irma also creates altars with crucifixes, angels, Virgin Mary figures bearing angels, nativity scenes and mermaids. Two other notable themes are fountains and reproduction of the Moctezuma cypress at Santa Mar√≠a del Tule, which are decorated with elements from the seven regions of Oaxaca. She says she is not bored with repetition of themes as she does them each time a little differently, because the decorative details are all done by hand. Her technique is also similar to her mothers, using simple tools including the bowl and plate ‚Äúwheel‚Äù as well as clay mined locally. Some of the basic shapes are created with molds but generally are modified by hand and the decorative details are also done by hand. She prefers to make pieces of natural clay color, so most of her pieces are not painted. However, sometimes she does cover them in a slip as a protective coating. Irma has also received numerous prizes and other recognitions for her work, including the Premio Fomento Cultual Banamex in 1996 and her work featured in the \\"Grandes Maestros del Arte Popular\\" and \\"Out of Volcanos\\" by Margaret Sayers Peden. Her work is also regularly exhibited such as a show sponsored by the Fomento Cultural Banamex in the city of Durango in 2012. Irma‚Äôs work is mostly sold to collectors and she feels it is important for people to see the creation process to truly appreciate the pieces. She trains other artisans in her community, creating an informal school. Alicia Leticia Garc√≠a Blanco Letty in her workshop Also known as Letty, Teodora's younger daughter specializes in small, imaginative pastillaje and engraved figures, especially mermaids. Other themes include women at the market, angels, humans on burros and nativity scenes. She began making pieces when she was nine or ten, becoming proficient with smaller pieces at age sixteen and larger pieces at age twenty. Today, Letty works with her two daughters, mostly by acquiring clay and selling their mother's work. Fernando F√©lix Peg√ºero Garc√≠a  Fernando F√©lix, born 1988 in Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa, is the son of Alicia Leticia and the grandson of Teodora. He began creating in clay when he was five, learning from his mother and has specialized in piece related to Day of the Dead. The artisan has participated in major folk art events such as those in 2008 and 2009 at the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular Oaxaca (MEAPO). In 2010, his work won two awards. One was first place in the miniatures category at the Friends of Oaxaca Folk Art‚Äôs young artist competition for a work called ‚ÄúThe Wedding of Catrina and the Cowboy.‚Äù This win allowed him to attend the Taller de Arte Pl√°sticas Rufino Tamayo in the city of Oaxaca to study ceramics, sculpting and painting. The other recognition from the Premio Nacional de Cer√°mica in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. He also won second place at the fifth State Nativity Contest in Oaxaca. Fernando has since enrolled as a fine arts major at the Universidad del Estado de Oaxaca. Other notable members of the family Avelino Blanco Nu√±ez Several other members of the Blanco family have continued the tradition of decorative pottery, all still in the same town in Oaxaca. Faustina Avelino Blanco N√∫√±ez is the brother of Teodora. He works with his two daughters and son to produce terra cotta, green glaze and multi-color glazed pieces. These pieces range from the purely decorative such as miniatures of musician and human figures to utilitarian works including jugs, planters, plates, containers and cups. All pieces are decorated with the pastillaje technique. The miniature musicians are inspired by the author‚Äôs decades as a guitarist. Bertha Blanco N√∫√±ez is Teodora's sister but much younger. Was taught the basics by their parents and at one time Teodora signed Bertha's work as her own. By age ten, she began to create small female figures and by the time she was sixteen had moved on to creating large images of the Virgin Mary which are now her trademark. When she married at age 27, she moved away from the family compound and began to work completely on her own. She does the work on her pieces completely by herself.

She and her team were the first to fully synthesize chloromycetin, also known as chloramphenicol. This was the first instance of an antibiotic being fully synthesized. Early life and education Mildred Catherine Rebstock, the daughter of Redna and Adolph Rebstock, was born Nov. 29, 1919 in Elkhart, Indiana. In 1938 she graduated from Elkhart High School, and then went on to further her education at North Central College. During her time at North Central, she was a member of a biology honors society, Beta Beta Beta, and was a member of the college's zoology club. She also retained a flawless grade-point average while studying under professors I.A. Koten and Harold Eigenbrodt of chemistry and zoology respectively. It was with these two professors where she found the inspiration to apply to their alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to pursue a doctoral degree after she graduated North Central with a bachelor's in 1942. With her impeccable grade-point average and passion for the sciences, she was able to receive a full fellowship to research ascorbic acid while studying at the university She earned her master's degree in 1943 and her doctorate in 1945. Professional career Dr. Rebstock was hired at Parke-Davis Research Labs from 1945 to 1977 as a junior research chemist and was later promoted to a research leader in 1959. Around this time she and her team were researching a newly discovered antibiotic streptomycin, first discovered by Albert Schatz. Parke-Davis's team of Dr. Rebstock and her team consisting of John Controulis, Harry Crooks, and Quentin Bartz discovered that greater chemical stability could be achieved through catalytic hydrogenation of streptomycin, and this new compound was named dihydrostreptomycin. This discovery was simultaneously made by a team at Merck & Co. Although the use of this antibiotic in humans has ceased, it is still used in veterinary medicine. Soon after her work with dihydrostreptomycin, Dr. Rebstock was tasked with synthesizing a new antibiotic found by John Ehrlich in a culture of Streptomyces venezuela. The molecule of this antibiotic was much simpler than those of previous antibiotics, which made. Rebstock's task easier. It was discovered that the key constituent of this molecule was a nitrobenzene ring, which was something the lab had already had prior experience with. Rebstock had found a way to fully synthesize this antibiotic around November 1947. This was a rare case where the synthetization of a molecule was more cost effective than fermenting it through organic processes. The team published their work in 1949. Because of the availability of chloromycetin after Rebstock's work, it was abundantly used to treat Rocky Mountain fever and Typhoid fever, and is still used today as a secondary course of action for extreme cases of meningitis, cholera, and other infectious bacterial diseases. Since its discovery, chloromycetin has been linked to an increased risk of fatal aplastic anemia leading to a decline in its use in humans in the United States. Although it has fallen out of favor in developed nations it is still a vital antibiotic used abundantly in developing nations. Because of this it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Mildred Rebstock and Eugene H. Payne. Payne had run the first clinical trials with chloromycetin. Because of her groundbreaking research, Time Magazine devoted an article to her in 1949, noting that \\"the achievement was due to teamwork. But a large part of the credit goes to pretty Dr. Mildred Rebstock, a 28-year-old research chemist.\\" Dr. Rebstock advocated for women in scientific research during an interview with the Smithsonian Institution Archives, she stated that, of all the researchers in the field only about three percent of them were women, but she would remain hopeful for the future. In 1950, Rebstock was awarded the \\"Science Woman of the Year\\" by the Women's National Press Club of Washington DC organization, and it was presented to her by President Truman. Rebstock continued her pharmaceutical research for the remainder of her career and spent the latter part of it researching fertility drugs and the synthesis of blood-lipid agents. She died at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbour, MI on February 17, 2011.

For the 2016 season, the team were preparing four Levorg Sports Tourers to the championship's Next Generation Touring Car specification. The BTCC Levorgs are configured as rear wheel drive rather than four wheel drive (which is disallowed by the championship's regulations). Former double champions Jason Plato and Colin Turkington piloted the cars, along with team owner Warren Scott. The marque's FA20 2.0 litre boxer engine was race prepared for the team by Mountune Racing. The 2017 season saw some changes, including Ashley Sutton joining the team from MG Racing. Sutton went on to win the 2017 British Touring Car Championship for the team. Jason Plato continued driving the Levorg, but struggled to find pace throughout the season. The 2018 season saw Team BMR switch from Mountune to Swindon as engine suppliers for the Levorg.

On August 21, 2020, the second-generation Levorg was released in Japan. According to Subaru engine designer Tsuneaki Numamiyauchi, the displacement of the CB18 was chosen to balance an increase in maximum torque to with improved fuel economy from adopting lean-burn technology. Fuel economy improved from compared to the preceding generation's FB16 engine. In addition, the overall length of the engine was shortened by , allowing for a larger crush zone for safety.

It was the stronghold of the Bozhou Tusi until its destruction by the Ming dynasty after the Bozhou rebellion. Hailongtun is an example of a well-preserved medieval castle in China. It is one of the three Tusi sites designated by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site on July 3, 2015.Laosicheng becomes the First World Cultural Heritage in Hunan: rednet.cn (04-Jul-15) Hailongtun was established in 1257 during the Southern Song dynasty. It served as the stronghold of the Bozhou Tusi (native chiefdom), ruled by the Yang family, from the Southern Song to the Ming dynasty. In the 28th year of the Wanli reign (1600), the Ming defeated the Bozhou rebellion, with the last tusi Yang Yinglong committing suicide and the castle was burned down. The castle occupies a total area of , with 6 eastern and 3 western passes and walls nearly long. It is surrounded by cliffs on all four sides with only one entrance from the mountain road. The pass on the mountain side was known as the Feihu Pass. The one to the east was called Feilong Pass. At the foot of the right hill is a copper column pass, whereas at the base of the left hill is the iron column pass. The castle's architecture reflects its strategic importance. The city gates were flanked by archer‚Äôs towers. Although there is nothing to support the tale, it is said that once a large stone wall, wide enough to allow horses to gallop on it, connected all of the passes. A deep moat surrounded the city.

Luglienga (also known as Lignan blanc and Seidentraube) is a white Italian wine and table grape variety that is grown across Europe. The grape has a long history of use, dating back to at least the 14th century in Piedmont but is today most seen a table grape that is occasionally used for home winemaking.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 556 Allen Lane 2012 History and relationship to other grapes In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that Luglienga shared a parent-offspring relationship with Pri√© blanc (pictured) with Luglienga likely being the parent variety. The first written documentation of Luglienga dates back to 1329 where it was listed under the old synonym Luglienchis growing in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. Ampelographers believe that the name is derived from the Italian Luglio which means July and could be a reference to the grape's tendency to ripen early in the growing season. The French synonym Jouanenc, derived from juin meaning June also seems to support the grape's reputation as an early ripening variety. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis confirmed what ampelographers such as Pierre Galet had long suspected--that the German/Swiss wine grape Siedentraube and the French wine grape Lignan blanc were in fact Luglienga. DNA also showed that Luglienga shares a parent-offspring relationship with the Valle d'Aosta wine grape Pri√© blanc with the older Luglienga likely being the parent variety. In 1929, Luglienga (as Siedentraube) was crossed with Gamay to create the white German wine grape Regner.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 151 Oxford University Press 1996 Viticulture Luglienga is often trained above the ground in pergola systems (example pictured in Trentino). Luglienga is an early ripening variety that can be very vigorous unless kept in check by wine pruning and leaf pulling. The vine has strong resistance to the viticultural hazard of winter frost but can very susceptible to developing botrytis bunch rot. The grape responds well to being trained in pergolas in front of houses or over gardens. Wine regions As a table grape, Luglienga is grown across Europe but is rarely used in winemaking apart from the occasional home winemaker.

In contrast to Catolasmus, the other Northern Hemisphere catophragmid genus, imbricating plates extend only partway up the primary shell wall, and have usually four whorls, as opposed to 10. Many specimens have been recovered with few or no accessory plates remaining. 491 As the imbricating whorls are small and apparently deciduous, this is explained as a result of grazing gastropods. The basis is calcareous, thin, and solid. Where it attaches to the shell wall, there are cavities matching small teeth on the basal edge of the wall plates. 491 The scutum differs from that of Catolasmus in showing a well defined lateral depressor muscle pit. The labrum bears teeth and bristles, unlike in Catolasmus. There has been some confusion as to the exact date of Sowerby's publication. Both 1826 and 1827 can be found in different publications. This problem was addressed by Sykes, 1906, and he concluded 1826 was the correct date. Sykes is followed here, and by this editor.  Nomenclature  * Type species: Catophragmus imbricatus Sowerby, 1826 ** Fixation: monotypy, by Sowerby, 1826 * Type locality: Antigua, Leeward Islands, (), attached to shell of Tetraclita porosa * Types: two specimens in British Museum  Habitat and Geographic range  Catophragmus imbricatus inhabits the lower littoral zone throughout the Western Atlantic (Bermuda) and West Indies. Although originally found on Antigua, it was not present there in 1998. Ross and Newman also reported occurrences in Cuba, Cozumel, and Islota Aves. These populations show sufficient differences in morphology to possibly belong to 2 or more species.

The temple, located near the Bradano river in the south of Italy, was part of a countryside sanctuary and remains of the wall of the temenos and of a very ancient altar are visible. History The remains are located in the archaeological area of Metapontum, on the last of the Givoni, ancient sandbanks near the right bank of the river Bradano, built over the remains of a neolithic village on the prehistoric road from Siris-Heraclea, about three kilometres from the ancient city of Metapontum. The temple, restored in 1961, was initially attributed to the cult of the goddess Athena, but a fragment of a vase found in the course of the 1926 archaeological excavations turned out to be a votive dedicated to the goddess Hera, showing that she was the patron of the sanctuary. Until the nineteenth century, the Tavole Palatine were also known locally as the Mensole Palatine (Palatine Shelves) or Colonne Palatine (Palatine Colonnade), probably in reference to the struggles of the French Paladins against the Saracens. The temple was also called the Scuola di Pitagora (School of Pythagoras) in memory of the great philosopher Pythagoras. In the Middle Ages it was also called the Mensae Imperatoris (Tables of the Emperor), probably referring to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II who camped at Metapontum during his expedition against the Saracens in 982. Description Remains of the central peripteros and of the stylobate The temple was composed of a central naos, preceded by a pronaos and with an adyton at the rear. Fifteen columns with twenty flutes and Doric capitals survive. Of these fifteen columns, ten are on the north side and five on the southern side. Originally there were thirty-two columns, since the temple had a peristasis of twelve columns on each long side and six on each short side. The stylobate was long and wide, the naos . The temple has decayed significantly because it was built with local limestone (so-called mazzarro). In the fifth century BC, the temple had a tiled roof with multi-coloured decoration in the Ionic tradition, with leonine protomes and gargoyles. Numerous remains of terracotta decoration, statuettes and ceramics, along with smaller column fragments were found near the temple during the 1926 excavations and are now kept at the Museo archeologico nazionale di Metaponto.

Early life  Born in New York, New York, on July 4, 1969, Yee is a third generation Chinese American. She has 1 older sister and 1 step brother, Noel Yee juggler, performer. Her family moved all over the New York area in her primary years and was a big influence on her photography as an adult. \\"When you move often, you learn to build relationships quickly and also learn how to move on from them, which is very similar to a shoot/set environment.\\" says Yee. Her parents divorced and her father gained custody of the children when Yee was 12. Shortly thereafter he was in a life-threatening car accident and became a paraplegic. This strong and tall man would always see life differently and from a different viewpoint. He encouraged his children to be involved in martial arts of which his oldest daughter took advantage of, but Yee was more interested in ballet, but she ultimately got involved in Japanese Martial Arts and is a 4th degree blackbelt in Kendo and has been practicing and competing for over 20 years, winning tournaments in Tokyo as well as the East Coast Woman's Kendo Championship. She also developed her love of photography at an early age after steeling her sister's Mikey Mouse Camera. In high school, her father bought her a SLR camera and started to experiment and learn the ins and outs of photography.  Early Career/Japan  Yee went did her undergraduate degree in SUNY Buffalo and received her degree in Communications in 1991. After college she worked went to work for J. Walter Thompson as a production manager working on the team to launch Prozac. Upon leaving there, she went to work at Wilhelmina Models in handling the kids model search, as well as doing PR and Meeting Planning at ... all giving her invaluable experience in planning and coordinating events which would prove invaluable as a photographer and in new project, Around Digital Media. Because of her love of Kendo and Japanese Culture, she went to Cornell University in 1996 and enrolled in their FALCon program (Full Year Asian Language Concentration) which is a 12-month immersion in Japanese, and received her certificate in 1997. The last quarter she moved to Japan and studied abroad at Hokkaido University in Sapporo and didn't come back to the US for 9 years. It was during this time that Yee decided to pursue her passion for photography. Acclaimed fashion photographer, Yoshihito Sasaguchi took her under his wing as his photo assistant and taught her about photography. He saw that she had an eye for it, but that she didn't know the ins and outs of photography so Yee credits him with teaching her to be the photographer she is today. She has developed a style of photography that captures the Japanese concept of ura (backside) and omote (front side), and shows through her work the duplicitous private and public side to her subjects. As writer Jean Snow describes her exhibit at the Nakaochiai Gallery \\"Back to the Streets,‚Äù \\"Yee redirects attention to the shotengai by juxtaposing these fading communities with the youth culture and fashion found in the city‚Äôs major centers. The extreme difference between Ura and Omote, or the surface and what lies beneath, is what continues to influence much of her work. The mainstream of much of Japanese society contrasts with what she calls, ‚Äúthe city‚Äôs crazy underworld of culture and landscape.‚Äù\\". Additionally in 2005, Yee was selected for the prestigious 2005 Photo District News (PDN) Photo Annual for Corporate Design- Photo Products for the brand Prohibit's men's fashion catalog.  Becky Yee Photography  Upon moving back to New York in 2008, Yee has been busy with exhibitions and also reestablishing herself as a versatile photographer in her editorial, commercial and curated work. Her work was displayed at the 2008 Media Facades Festival in Berlin, Germany. She has worked with corporate clients such as designer Anna Sui to being featured in a Sony campaign for their new camera, the Alpha NEX7. One of the first exhibitions she released was \\"More Than A Woman\\" which was written up in the Village Voice as well as Art Forum. This was a controversial exhibition that chronicles a man in Tokyo, who proclaims to be the world's largest collector of \\"Dutch Wives\\" (Datchu- waifu) with over 70 anatomically correct, life-sized sex dolls. Yee continues to develop projects and exhibitions that utilize photography, video, music and other media to create unique images that show the provocative and vulnerable side of her subjects and topics.  Around Digital Media  Around Digital Media is a new venture from Yee, that focuses on commercial clients providing them a comprehensive collection of content to launch a new project. Working with a diverse creative team, the team comes up with visuals for all of their marketing and promotional needs. The concept is to shoot exclusive as well as shared content; video, photos, behind the scenes, interviews, graphics, advertising spots, and then create a 1-month, 3 month and/or 6 month roll out strategy to use these assets to maximize their marketing dollars.

Tangascootack Creek stretches for through Bald Eagle, Beech Creek and Colebrook Townships. Its watershed covers 36.5 square miles. Among its tributaries are North Fork Tangascootack Creek and Muddy Run, and there is also a swamp called Bear Swamp near the headwaters. Coal mining, including strip mining, was common in the watershed throughout the 1800s and 1900s. The creek experiences acid mine drainage, much of which comes from Muddy Run. The watershed is mostly forest and sparsely populated. Historically, the area supports industry in agriculture, lumbering, and coal and iron mining. Native American crucibles have been discovered along the Creek. Minerals in the watershed are mostly bituminous coal, fireclay, sandstone and slate. The daily loads of aluminum and manganese are both many times higher than the creek's total maximum daily load. The conductance of the creek ranges from 93.7 to 549 micro-siemens per centimeter. The creek is one of the most downstream tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River contributing acid mine drainage to it. Pocono sandstone can also be found in the watershed, and bituminous coal formations known as the Clarion Formation, the Lower Kittanning Formation and the Eagleton Coal field also exist in the creek's watershed. The valley of Tangascootack Creek is the only place in Bald Eagle Township where there are significant deposits of minerals. The middle and upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the headwaters have some aquatic life, as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it. Course Tangascootack Creek is long. The creek flows northeast from the marshland of Beech Creek Township, in Sproul State Forest, near the border between Clinton County and Centre County. It passes strip mines and Bear Swamp before entering Bald Eagle Township. It then flows past more strip mines before entering into a gradually deepening gorge. Over the next few miles, it makes several meanders before being joined by its tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek and eventually the tributary Bird Run. The creek briefly enters Colebrook Township before flowing into the West Branch Susquehanna River, west of Farrandsville. =Tributaries= Tangascootack Creek has a major tributary, North Fork Tangascootack Creek, a minor tributary called Muddy Run and at least two that are unnamed. Hydrology A 2011 study found an aluminium concentration of 1.12 milligrams per liter near the confluence with Muddy Run. This equates to 23.8 pounds (10.8 kilograms) per day, far greater that the total maximum daily load that is allowed under United States water quality standards. The iron concentration is 0.87 milligrams per liter, or per day. The concentration of manganese is 15.19 milligrams per liter, or per day, 101 times higher than the maximum load of per day allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Just above the creek's confluence with North Fork Tangascootack Creek, the aluminum concentration is 0.4 milligrams per liter and the daily load is . The concentration of iron is 0.08 milligrams per liter, or per day. The concentration of manganese is 3.32 milligrams per liter and the load is per day. This is only about seven times higher than the maximum allowable load, much less than the manganese load near Muddy Run. Near Muddy Run, the concentration of acidity is 27.44 milligrams per liter, which equates to a load of per day and upstream of North Fork Tangascootack Creek, the concentration is 7.80 milligrams per liter and the daily load is . The pH of the creek was measured in four locations in early July 2010. It ranged from 6.24 downstream of Muddy Run to 6.79 at further downstream of Muddy Run, with an average pH of 6.58. The conductance of Tangascootack Creek at several sites in 2010 ranged from 93.7 micro-siemens per centimeter at the site T-0.5 to 549 micro-siemens per centimeter at the site T-2 and the average was 357.4 micro- siemens per centimeter. The water temperature of the creek was measured at two sites downstream of Muddy Run in July 2010. It was and at the sites. Traveling downstream, Tangascootack Creek is one of the last streams to contribute acid mine drainage to the West Branch Susquehanna River. Watershed Tangascootack Creek's watershed covers 36.4 square miles (94 km2) in the southern part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats. Geography and geology The Tangascootack Creek valley is the only part of Bald Eagle Township that has significant amounts of minerals. Sandstones and conglomerates are visible on escarpments on the sides of the creek. Pocono sandstone is found on both the main stem and North Fork Tangascootack Creek, but no Mauch Chunk red shale is found near either branch. Coal formations in the creek's watershed include the Clarion formation, the Lower Kittaning formation, and the Eagleton coal field. Brown sandstone from the surface to down, blue slate from about to down, and fireclay from to down are also found in the rocks on the creek. Two to three feet of coal are below the fireclay and 4 to 5.5 feet are below the brown sandstone. Additionally, a graphite deposit was discovered on the creek by James David. The coal in the creek's watershed is bituminous coal. A bed of coal known as the middle bed was observed in the 1800s to be found near the mouth of Tangascootack Creek, as well as in other locations. This bed ranged from to thick and contained iron pyrite as well. It was at least underground. An 1854 report estimated that there were of workable coal near Tangascootack Creek. The Tangascootack Creek watershed consists chiefly of valleys and rolling and broken hills. The creek's river channel is relatively sinuous. It is mostly sandstone and shale with some coal. The slope of the creek is per mile, and its mouth's elevation is above sea level. History A settler named Dan Jones was killed by Indians on Tangascootack Creek in late fall 1777. In 1854, James Wilson discovered several crudely constructed crucibles in a place known as the Rock Cavern on Tangascootack Creek. They were made by Native Americans and had been used for smelting. Around 1840, the canal commissioners of a canal on the West Branch Susquehanna River received instructions to extend the canal as far as the mouth of Tangascootack Creek. Mining in the creek's watershed began in 1844. A number of mining villages existed in the Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, with some of the deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth. A gristmill built at the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley. In the late 1800s, lumbering on North Fork Tangascootack Creek was a viable industry and the historic community of Eagleton was in the Tangascootack Creek valley. In the early 20th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad passed through the Tangascootack Creek basin. During this time, the Scootac Railway ran alongside the upper reaches of the creek. John Reaville said around 1940 that the Tangascootack Creek valley is the \\"only one in Pennsylvania with four deserted villages that once flourished so promisingly on the eastern base of the great bituminous coal fields of Pennsylvania and marked its progress westward.\\" = Etymology = \\"Tangascootac\\" is a Native American word for \\"a foe\\" and also refers to a Nanticoke chief. The creek has sometimes been called Scootack or Tangascootac Creek. Biology Tangascootack Creek is considered to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek. The quantity of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been measured by the West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2--the main creek just above and below the entry of Muddy Run, respectively--and T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa richness, as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck‚Äôs Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325. The West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition measured several sites on Tangascootack Creek based on their habitat quality. The assessment measured 12 different values, including instream cover and the width of the riparian zone on a scale of 0 to 240. The site T-1 had a score of 203 and the site T-3 had a score of 198. Both were considered optimal habitats. However, T-2 had a score of 179, making it a suboptimal habitat. A total of 13 benthic macroinvertebrates were observed by the West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition at site T-1. Five were observed at site T-2 and three were observed at site T-3. The benthic macroinvertebrates included two specimens each of Leuctra, Palpomyia, Dicranota, Diplectrona, and Hydropsyche Chironomidae. One specimen of Sialis was observed. The benthic macroinvertebrates included three specimens of Chironomidae, and one each of Tipula and Trepobates. The benthic macroinvertebrates included one specimen each of Chironomidae, Hydropsyche, and Ceratopsyche.

The area of low pressure that eventually became Zelda formed near the International Date Line, and strengthened into a tropical depression on November 27\\\\. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity near the Marshall Islands on November 28, thus naming it Zelda. On November 29, the storm quickly strengthened to according to the JTWC, equivalent to a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. It reached a peak of according to the JTWC, and according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), with a barometric pressure of . Zelda weakened into a tropical storm on December 2, and then a tropical depression two days later. The JTWC discontinued warnings late on December 4, while the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical the next day and continued to track until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7. Zelda caused significant damage in the Marshall Islands, and operations at Kwajalein Missile Range were disrupted severely. No deaths or injuries were reported. About 60 percent of homes were destroyed in Ebeye Island, leaving 6,000 people without residence. Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt. Later in December, President of the United States George H. W. Bush declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with funding and repairs. The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries. Meteorological history Westerly winds near the equator ‚Äì associated with an ongoing El Ni√±o event ‚Äì assisted in spawning a weak area of low pressure in late November 1991 near the International Date Line. The JTWC began tracking the area on the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory at 06:00 UTC on November 25\\\\. Vertical wind shear prevented strengthening at first, but the disturbance continued to develop. A tropical cyclone formation alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) soon followed. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance at 06:00 UTC on November 27, and the JTWC issued their first warning 18 hours later on the depression, naming it 31W. The depression quickly intensified, and it was designated a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on November 28 by the JTWC, with winds of . Operationally, the storm was upgraded twenty-four hours later and given the name Zelda, after Kwajalein received stronger winds than expected. The JTWC attributed the delay to the small size of the storm, the poorly organized outflow, and the lack of visible and infrared image pairs for analysis. The JMA upgraded the storm at 03:00 UTC on November 29, then to a severe tropical storm eighteen hours later. The JTWC reported that Zelda intensified into a typhoon at 12:00 UTC near the Marshall Islands, with winds of , equivalent to a Category 1 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. At that time, the JMA kept it as a tropical storm with winds of , with a pressure reading of . Around 06:00 UTC on November 30, the JMA estimated Zelda had reached its peak at , with a barometric pressure of . Six hours later, the JTWC reported the storm had strengthened to maximum sustained winds of , west of Enewetak. Later, a trough created by Typhoon Yuri caused the subtropical ridge to weaken, allowing Zelda to move northward. By December 1, the storm began to weaken and turned northeast. On December 2, the JMA reported the storm's winds had decreased to . The JTWC reported the storm weakened below typhoon strength on 18:00 UTC of the same day, with winds of . Upper-level winds and westerlies soon increased, and Zelda's central convection became sheared. The JMA downgraded Zelda to a tropical storm on December 3, and to a tropical depression later that day. A few hours later, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, as it unexpectedly turned to the northwest. The low-level circulation of the storm detached from the cold front, and the JTWC issued the last warning of the year. The depression turned back northeast, the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical on December 5, and the agency stopped tracking it just past the International Date Line on December 7. Remnants of the storm moved inland into northern British Columbia by December 8. Impact and aftermath Zelda was the first of three storms to strike the Marshall Islands within one year, just before Axel and Gay in 1992. The storm affected Marshall Islands on November 28, producing sustained winds ranging from . The storm impacted islands of Kwajalein, Majuro, Lae, Wotho, and Eniwetok. Kwajalein Missile Range, which was used in Strategic Defense Initiative testing, caught stronger winds than expected from the storm, affecting operations at the missile range. A pressure of was recorded on Kwajalein, which was the lowest pressure recorded on the atoll at that time. On Ebeye Island, 60 percent of homes made of plywood and sheet-iron roofs were destroyed by the storm, and 6,000 people were left homeless. Food and water supplies were contaminated from salt in storm surge, and the water desalination plant became inoperable. Power lines were cut across the island. There were no deaths or significant injuries. Other islands in the nation had their water contaminated by saltwater, and 95 percent of the crops were destroyed by the storm surge. Coral reefs were also heavily damaged when the storm came nearby. As an extratropical cyclone, Zelda bought heavy rain and winds to Southeast Alaska. Heavy snow was reported in northern British Columbia, and lesser amounts inland British Columbia and southern Yukon. The United States Army engaged in clean up and repairing in the country. On December 6, the 834th Airlift Division sent six C-130s to Kwajalein with supplies. On the same day, President of the United States George H. W. Bush, through the Compact of Free Association, declared a major disaster in the Marshall Islands, allowing federal funding to be sent to the Arno, Aur, Kwajalein, Lae, Lib, Namu and Ujae islands. United States Senator Daniel Akaka visited Ebeye after the storm, and he criticized the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as the funding did not cover repairing of structures regarded as substandard. The Government of the Marshall Islands requested for aid via United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) on December 18. By December 19, 1,380 people were still living in temporary shelters. By March 26, 1992, about $98,000 (1992 USD, ) worth of relief goods were sent to the Marshall Islands from UNDRO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Government of Australia. FEMA sent $1.518 million (1992 USD, ) to affected families. Critical infrastructure in Ebeye were repaired by the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority by November 1992.

He was Research Associate at the Office of Population Research, Princeton University from 1961 to 1964. While at Princeton, he participated in the African Demographic Project which resulted in a major collective book, The Demography of Tropical Africa (Brass et al., Princeton University Press, 1968).

Persistence of High Fertility in Tropical Africa: The Case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Population and Development Review, vol.37 (1), March 2011. and the emerging fertility patterns in African urban agglomerations. The earlier period of Belgian colonial rule in the Congo was dominated by concerns of depopulation believed to be brought by an excessive mortality due to the exploitation of native populations in mercantile pursuits (rubber extraction, in particular) as well as to new infections, introduced by the coloniser, all the more lethal as natives lacked natural immunity. This was the version of depopulation of post-Colombian America. Some Western authorsHochschild A. 1998. King Leopold Ghost, a Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company. went so far as to speak of genocide being perpetrated during the Belgian colonial rule under Leopold II's reign (losses of 10 million population are being cited). Romaniuk makes a strong case of depopulation by widespread sterility caused by venereal diseases. Remarkably, the zone of massive sterility coincides geographically, grosso modo, with the regions in central and North-East of the Congo devastated by Afro-Arab slavery campaigns in the second half of the 19th century. These regions have since recovered demographically; excessive sterility has practically disappeared. This seems to be due to anti-venereal campaigns, growing public awareness of the sexually transmitted diseases, and possibly due to the degeneration of the venereal germs as they evolve from the epidemic to endemic states (typical case for syphilis). In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, fertility remains high even today. Under the prevailing conditions of persistent precarious economic conditions and social insecurity, Romaniuk argues, the nuclear family is not an alternative to the extended kinship with its deep-seated sense of solidarity and lineage. Moved by culture and atavism, and no less by economic rationality, the belief regarding the benefits of numerous progeny for security continues to prevail, although procreative patterns are moderate to optimise the chances of coping with the challenges of modernity. Since he moved to Canada in 1964, Romaniuk took a particular interest in the demography of Aboriginal peoples. According to Romaniuk, in the four centuries since the Europeans first set foot in the country, the demography of the Aboriginal peoples has taken dramatic twists, from near extinction, due primarily to the epidemics brought by Europeans to which they lacked immunity, to impressive demographic recovery. However, their resilience against superior forces, their vitality to recover under the most adverse of conditions, should not blind us from recognising, he argues, the inherent vulnerability of a minority, which is numerically weaker, fragmented, and widely dispersed, still contending with many attributes of an underprivileged class of people. =Theoretical demography= Of significance are his contributions to the theory of the onset of the demographic (fertility) transition and post-transitional demographic regime. It is generally assumed that modernisation brings with it fertility decline. This is true generally but not necessarily at its earliest stages. In traditional, pre-modern society, a host of biological and cultural factors, such as protracted lactation, prolonged post-partum sexual abstinence, malnutrition and infections-induced sterility kept fertility well below the potential. With modernisation, these fertility-depressing factors are weakened or removed all together. Yet, birth control had not reached the critical level to counter these modernisation-associated factors - hence the rise in fertility. Evidence from African populations and North American Aboriginals support the thesis. As to the post-transitional demographic stages, according to Romaniuk, nations of western civilisation in particular, have entered what he calls demographic maturity. Living longer and healthier while at the same time reproducing less and less are its two major correlates. Generational sub- replacement fertility, advanced aging and population implosion are its inherent features. To manage the emerging demographic regime new ways of thinking about population and innovative policy approaches are called for, according to him. =Methodology= Much of Dr. Romaniuk's work was methodological.Romaniuk, A. 1987. Population Estimation Methods (Editor and contributor), Statistics Canada, Ottawa. During his tenure with the Princeton African Project, he endeavoured to develop ways of deriving basic population parameters from incomplete data. The so-called Brass method to derive fertility and mortality parameters for the history of mothers' ever born and surviving children, and the stable population models developed by Ansley Coale and Paul DemenyCoale J. A. and P. Demeny. 1966. Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations, Princeton University Press. at Princeton University figured prominently in this endeavour. During his tenure at the Canada Federal Bureau of Statistics, he endeavoured to develop methods for population estimation. His particular interest was in population forecasting methodology. According to him, one must balance parsimony with efficiency, minimise the input and maximise the projection output, by selecting a limited numbers of parameters with inherent analytical capacity. The credibility of forecasting rests largely on the analytical quality of the assumptions underlying projections.Romaniuk A. 1990. Population Projection as Prediction, Simulation and Prospective Analysis, Population Bulletin, Population Division, United Nations, 1990. =Political demography= At the mature stages of his intellectual life, he came to take particular interest in population policies. Inspired by the classical economist John Stuart Mill, he advocates for stationary population as an optimal response to the quest for ecological and economic sustainability, national identity, social cohesion and world peace. Western democracies, in particular, are faced with a unique set of challenges arising out of the prevailing imbalance between fertility and immigration. Hence, in order to actualize the benefits of a stationary demographic configuration, they need to raise their fertility to the generational replacement level. In respect to the doctrinal debates, the virtue of the stationary population is that it cuts across ecologists' long-term concerns and economists' short term concerns.Romaniuk, A. 2012. Stationary Population as Policy Vision, Optimum online, Journal of Public Sector Management, vol. 42 (1), March 2012. Dr. Romaniuk's outlook of the Western European civilization is rather pessimistic, Spenglerian. Under the guise of multiculturalism, new \\"instant, artificial societies\\" are erected, purely based on formal citizenship, thus superseding the notion of the historical nation taking centuries to evolve into a nationally conscious community of peoples. Europe of the 20th century had a disastrous record of failed attempts to create instantaneously man-made new types of societies, inspired by either classless society or racist ideologies. While singling out national identity as an issue, no intent is implied therein of elevating nationhood to the sacrosanct to be forever locked and frozen in time. Nor would he suggest closing the gates to the transnational movement of people. Not all is wrong with multiculturalism, he argues. Respect for another's culture is a virtue in itself. Diasporas, in many cases, can play a positive role in interstate relations, and in mutual enrichment through cross-fertilisation. The matter is not all-or-nothing, but that of moderation. It all boils down to the question of what the French humanist, writer and philosopher, Albert Camus, encapsulated in two words: \\"mesure et d√©mesure\\". Dr. Romaniuk's book, Fertility in Canada: from Baby Boom to Baby Bust, published by Statistics Canada in 1984, deserves to be singled out for it stirred wide public debate on the future of Canada, and brought successive governments to adopt policies, particularly about immigration, to counter potential population implosion.Romaniuk, A. 1984.

Personal life A string of personal tragedies and political upheavals in Central and Eastern Europe affected his childhood and early youth. His father, Ivan (Vania) Romaniuk, a veteran of the Russian Imperial Army during the First World War on the Eastern front and a public figure in his native province, Bessarabia (formerly part of the Russian Empire and Romania between 1919 and 1940), was elected Deputy to the Parliament of Romania in Bucharest in 1925. He died in 1929 at the age of 37 from ailments he suffered during the war, leaving his young wife widowed with two small children, aged three and five. The invasion of his native Bessarabia by the Soviets in 1940 brought with it massive deportations to Siberia. His mother and her two children were also targeted to be deported but managed to escape, only to be forced out of the country. They ended up in Germany, which his mother and sister escaped a year later. Her son's attempt to escape landed him in prison in Berlin in 1942 (Alexander Platz Gef√§ngnis). Eventually, he managed to escape to Przemy≈õl, Poland. There, he enrolled as clandestine student in a Ukrainian high school, which he successfully completed in 1944. He escaped the advance of the Soviet army to Slovakia and later to Austria where he was again arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in Vienna. He miraculously escaped shortly before Vienna was taken over by the Soviet army. He witnessed the collapse of Nazi Germany in Munich in May 1945. Separated from his widowed mother and sister during the war, it took fifteen years of searching to locate and reconnect with them in Bucharest, Romania, where they had settled. He kept active all through his life, his last academic work coming out a few months before his death.Romaniuk, A. (2017).

It essentially paralleled the US case Associated Press v. Meltwater, insofar as it considered the same questions and essentially the same nature of plaintiffs, and the same defendant, as the US case - namely whether media clippings business Meltwater Group was in breach of copyright by providing a paid clippings services from (copyrighted) news sources, to its clients. The UK case, was decided by lower courts in favour of the NLA at the initial case and at appeal. The Court of Appeal ruled that 'most if not all' reports would be subject to copyright, and confirmed that headlines in bulk were also subject. One element was overturned by the UK Supreme Court who ruled users were entitled to view, but not print or copy, a hypothetical reduced Meltwater report without a licence. The practical effect at the end was that Meltwater and their clients took a licence. Certain questions referred to the European Court of Justice were intended to clarify matters of a cross-border nature.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62013CJ0360&qid;=1401959911292&from;=EN  Issue  Meltwater Group operated a media monitoring service in which relevant results are shown to clients who pay Meltwater, but do not buy a license from a newspaper company or copyright service to read the brief extracts displayed to them by Meltwater (unless they wish to proceed and view the entire source article). NLA media access, part of the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA), a licensing organization, introduced a license covering media monitoring services that crawl sites and offer paid-for services based on their filtered results. The majority of media monitoring agencies signed up for the new NLA web licence with the exception of Meltwater who argued no license was required by its clients for this purpose, and in conjunction with the PRCA referred the scheme to the Copyright Tribunal, and the matter was escalated. The case revolved around whether a client lacking a license would infringe copyright by being shown, and viewing, the extracts from copyrighted material in this way. (It was common ground that to subsequently view a full article would of course require a license.) NLA argued that for an end user to view indexed media, and viewable extracts, constituted 'copying' and re-use by the end user, and was therefore infringing.  Ruling  It was held that Meltwater's clients did not need a license to view copyright material on a computer as collated by Meltwater, on the rationale that: # \\"Article 5.1 [of the European Directive Directive 2001/29/EC which covers \\"temporary copies\\"] is an exception to the copyright owner‚Äôs right to control the reproduction of his work. It necessarily operates to authorize certain copying which would otherwise be an infringement of the copyright owner‚Äôs rights.\\" # \\"[I]t has never been an infringement, in either English or EU law, for a person merely to view or read an infringing article in physical form. This state of affairs, which is recognised in the enumeration of the copyright owner‚Äôs rights in articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Directive, has never been thought inconsistent with a high level of protection for intellectual property.\\" (Also noted was that to prohibit mere viewing would make infringers of millions of people who would be unaware or unable to prevent themselves from being shown, or temporary automated copies made, of such material, insofar as almost all online content is some person's copyright.) # The court noted in its ruling, that earlier rulings were made without the benefit or citation of recent crucial cases such as Football Association Premier League Ltd v QC Leisure and Others (C-403/08, F.S.R. 495), Karen Murphy v Media Protection Services Ltd ('Premier League') (C-429/08, 1 CMLR 769), and Infopaq International A/S v. Danske Dagblades Forening ('Infopaq II') (Case C-302/10), which strongly informed the outcome. In particular, the Murphy case had ruled that the transmission of copyrighted material through a network was legal regardless of the standing or authorization of the prospective end user (whomever it might be), and therefore temporary copies used for the technical purpose of communicating a copyright information was by implication also lawful provided the eventual act was lawful and certain other conditions were likely to be met. Since the 'eventual act' was mere viewing of copyright material, a lawful action under EU and UK law, the technical creation of temporary copies to enable that act, were also ruled lawful. More exactly, it was a separable question, whether an end user might violate copyright in their copying of the material and whether the making of temporary copies to allow that user to view the material was itself a breach of copyright. An end user viewing the material was not of itself a copyright-breaching act (as mere viewing is not a copyright breach), therefore automated temporary copies for technical reasons, used to facilitate and enable that lawful act, were also to be deemed within the scope of EU law and lawful.  Parallel US case  A parallel case (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2013) filed on the same grounds in the United States, however, was decided the other way in 2013 (in favor of Meltwater and against the equivalent newspaper licensing business, in that case Associated Press) by a US district court. In that case, the Associated Press (AP) brought suit against Meltwater Group for clipping and sharing news items under copyright infringement and \\"hot news\\" misappropriation under New York common law. In a cross-motion for summary judgement, Meltwater argued they were not infringing under the requirements of fair use. Meltwater claimed that their service was transformative and therefore non-infringing on copyright. The court held that Meltwater's copying was not protected under the United States' \\"fair use\\" doctrine and was infringing on AP's copyright. Subsequently, both the Associated Press and Meltwater dismissed all claims and counterclaims in July 2013. After the litigation, the Associated Press and Meltwater partnered to develop new products whose aim would be to benefit both companies.  See also  * Associated Press v.

It was executed in Arles around November 1888 and is in the collection of the Hermitage Museum. It was intended as decoration for his bedroom at the Yellow House.  Background  The \\"Garden at Etten\\" refers to the parsonage garden at Etten (now Etten-Leur) where Vincent's father, pastor Theodorus van Gogh, had been called in 1875. Vincent spent periods of time there, notably from Easter to Christmas 1881 when he returned to join his brother Theo, an art dealer, determined to become an artist. This period at Etten represents the beginning proper of Vincent's ten-year career as an artist. He had drawn since boyhood, and the previous year had enrolled in a beginners' class in Brussels where he met the painter Anthon van Rappard, but he now began to draw in earnest. He rapidly developed an accomplished technique in landscape drawing but remained rather more uncertain in his figure drawing, which he practised assiduously with the aid of Charles Bargue's drawing course.Hulsker pp. 13-29 Rappard made a twelve-day visit during this time, and they sketched together in the marshes and heaths round Etten. Vincent also visited his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve in The Hague, a celebrated artist of the time, who had expressed an interest in his drawings and who encouraged him further. At this time Vincent had not progressed as far as painting, though he did wash some of his drawings with watercolor. At the end of the year he made an extended visit to Mauve, who introduced him to painting. He returned to Etten with the intention of setting up a studio there.Naifeh and White Smith pp. 230-52 That summer Vincent became infatuated with his recently widowed cousin Kee Vos-Stricker, daughter of the theologian Johannes Stricker, who had been invited to stay over the summer with her eight-year-old son Jan. Vincent had last visited her in Amsterdam some three years before while her husband was still alive (there is a family photo extant dating from 1872 thought to show Vincent side by side with Kee), but now her new situation stirred his tender feelings and romantic disposition. They took pleasant walks together and within the fortnight Vincent proposed marriage.Tralbaut 1969 pp. 78-80 She famously rebuffed him with a curt \\"No, at no time, never\\",Hulsker p. 22 abruptly taking her leave for Amsterdam and never dealing with him again. Vincent's obsessive attempts to press his suit eventually became a matter of family scandal, culminating in a bitter quarrel with his father on Christmas Day and his leaving the family home to set up his proposed studio in The Hague instead.Tralbaut 1969 pp. 77-9, 84-6 Vincent subsequently painted in Drenthe, Nuenen (his last family home), and Antwerp, before joining Theo in Paris in 1886, Finally he set up a studio in 1888 at the Yellow House in Arles, where he was joined by Paul Gauguin, with the intention of forming an artists' commune.Gayford 2008  History  The painting is plainly influenced by Gauguin's Arl√©siennes (Mistral) painted at the same time.De La Faille p. 221 In his letters about the painting Vincent makes it clear he was at pains to use his imagination in the way Gauguin was countenancing. In Gauguin's painting the figure of the older woman is recognisably Madame Ginoux who ran the Caf√© de la Gare where Vincent had lodged and which he and Gauguin continued to patronise after moving into the nearby Yellow House. Vincent's figures are generally taken to be his mother and sister Willemien. Vincent 's biographer Marc Edo Tralbaut, however, was of the opinion that the younger woman was, consciously or unconsciously, a representation of Kee Vos Stricker.Tralbaut (1962) pp. 16-28Tralbaut (1969) pp. 80-2 Vincent was somewhat enigmatic on the subject in a letter to his sister: In a later letter, he says he has spoiled the painting and refers to it as \\"that thing I did of the garden at Nuenen\\" (i.e. his later family home and not Etten), leading Hulsker to suggest he really had no particular location in mind.Hulsker p. 374 Hulsker is puzzled by the remark that Vincent thought he had spoiled the painting, describing the painting as fascinating and enigmatic, \\"rich in subdued yet sparkling colours\\". Both he and Tralbaut are reminded of medieval stained-glass windows.

Gauguin's influence  In his catalogue raisonn√©, Hulsker considers the claim that the radical changes now evident in Vincent's work were a result of Gauguin's influence and the Synthetic Symbolism style of painting, a fusion of Neo-Impressionism, Japonisme, and Pont Aven Symbolism, that he developed with √âmile Bernard.Hulsker pp. 374-6 In a collection of reminisces Avant et Apr√®s published 15 years later, Gauguin himself made the claim:Hulsker p. 376 Hulsker remarks that in reality Vincent was already in his prime as an artist when Gauguin arrived. For a while he was influenced by Gauguin's theory of painting from the imagination and Memory of the Garden at Etten is certainly a conscious effort to paint in this style, but he soon returned to Realism. As for the Sunflower paintings, those had been completed fully two months before Gauguin's arrival.

Army career MacDermott entered the British army in the year 1808, as an officer in the 8th Regiment of Foot, and during the same year saw active service in the West Indies, when the British forces captured the Island of Martinique, after several days' fighting in the field and six weeks siege of Fort Bourbon. After this MacDermott saw some severe work during the War of 1812 between England and the United States ; and in 1812, on the frontier of the State of New York was dangerously wounded in the neck, the gullet being divided. In the winter of 1814-15 he was the bearer of a despatch from Montreal to Upper Canada, announcing the termination of hostilities. His regiment was ordered to return to Europe to join in the conflict with Napoleon, after the Emperor's escape from Elba. Ten thousand troops embarked at Quebec on this service, but on the convoy reaching the English Channel, they learned that the battle of Waterloo had been fought and won seven days previously. After this MacDermott served in the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean, and found time for a tour through France, Switzerland,and Italy. At Argostoli, in the island of Cephalonia, he became acquainted with Lord Byron, who entrusted him with the three last cantos of Don Juan, to be delivered to Sir John Cam Hobhouse, a commission which MacDermott executed, having just then obtained leave of absence in order to visit England. Subsequently he was with his regiment in various parts of the United Kingdom till the year 1829, when he resolved to sell out of the army and emigrate to Australia. Business career in Australia In the following year MacDermott, with several other officers who had sold their commissions, emigrated to Western Australia, and he settled as an agriculturist on the Swan River, where he purchased 5,000 acres, having also the right to select a large block of over 20,000 acres, according to the regulations, on account of property and servants be introduced into the colony. The first Bank at Swan River was started through MacDermott's suggestion and exertions, backed up by colonists of influence and means, and he was appointed Manager. Five years afterwards the Bank of Australasia proposed to amalgamate with the local institution, and this being agreed, sent a Manager from London, who died before the Bank was opened, and MacDermott was made Manager of the new Bank. Five years later the Australasian Bank resolved to close their branch at Perth, Western Australia and offered MacDermott the Managership of that at Adelaide, which he accepted. On leaving Swan River he received a flattering address, signed by all the members of the Executive Council, the Magistrates, clergy, and many others. Just before leaving England for Western Australia he married, and all his children were born in that colony. In Adelaide, under his management, the Australasian Bank secured a large share of the business. With George Tinline he supported the Bullion Act, which at a critical time saved the colony from serious financial embarrassment. Soon afterwards his connection with the Bank ceased, and he entered into general commercial business, in which he was not successful. Political career In the year 1855 MacDermott offered himself as a candidate to represent the Noarlunga District, in the old mixed Council, composed of two-thirds elected members, and one-third nominees, but was defeated, and accepted a nomineeship. MacDermott was soon afterwards appointed Chairman of Committees. MacDermott was member of the Council from 25 October 1855 until it was abolished on 2 February 1857. MacDermott then represented Flinders in the South Australian House of Assembly from 23 February 1857 to 1 September 1859, being Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration from 1 September 1857 to 30 September 1857. Late life and legacy In 1859 MacDermott was appointed a Special Magistrate, and presided at the Willunga and Morphett Vale Courts, till removed to the North, where he administered justice in the Local Courts of Redruth, Clare, Auburn, and Riverton. After 10 years' service as a Stipendiary Magistrate Macdennott retired, and received, on relinquishing his post, two gratifying addresses, one from the members of the bar practising in the Northern Courts, and the other from all the Magistrates and numerous other residents of the district. Macdermott always took a very warm interest in religious matters, particularly in connection with the Church of England, of which he was a member. His long and honourable life was varied and eventful, and in compliance with the wishes of some members of his family, he three years ago drew up a condensed account of his career, which was printed exclusively for the use of his relatives and friends and obtained by the South Australian Advertiser. MacDermott was survived by a widow and three daughters. Their eldest daughter Caroline (ca.1822 ‚Äì 1 June 1855) married Francis Dutton, C.M.G., (Premier of South Australia in the 1860s), and died many years before MacDermott, after giving birth to (later Sir) Frederick Dutton (14 April 1855 ‚Äì c. 10 October 1930).

The origins of the group lay in the frustration of some Conservatives with what they perceived as the Party's negative defence of the status quo under the leadership of Arthur Balfour in response to the Liberal government's People's Budget. On 30 August 1910 the Conservative MP Henry Page Croft published an article in The Morning Post headed ‚ÄúReveille‚Äù. He said that a \\"sleeping sickness\\" had permeated the ranks of the party, that the prospect of a Canadian trade agreement with America was dangerous for British trade and industry and that what was needed was Imperial Preference.Lord Croft, My Life of Strife (London: Hutchinson, 1948), p. 53. Soon afterwards, fellow Conservatives asked Croft to organise a campaign throughout the country. Consequently, a considerable fund was raised and Conservative Associations in the major cities organised mass meetings for Reveille members.Croft, p. 54. Soon there were 100 peers and MPs in the Reveille and there was a dinner held at Princes restaurant, Piccadilly, where Croft and Lord Willoughby de Broke spoke. Present were Acland Hood, the Conservative Chief Whip, and Percival Hughes, the Conservative Chief Agent. Willoughby de Broke outlined Reveille's programme: (1) Defence.--Maintenance of the supremacy of the Navy and an adequate Army. The naval programme to be completed, if necessary, by a naval loan. (2) Trade Reform.--A scientific tariff to be framed for the defence of British industries against unfair foreign competition, coupled with a scheme of industrial insurance. (3) Empire Union.--Imperial Preference for the establishment of trade partnership throughout the Empire to be immediately initiated. (4) Land Reform.--Small ownership for which facilities may be granted to working men to purchase land on easy terms, with the assistance of Government credit. (5) Poor Law Reform to meet modern conditions.Croft, pp. 54-55. NotesFurther reading *G. D.

The show mainly focuses on money-related matters like stock investments, personal finance, and business planning. Breaking down complex information for its viewers, the show aims to help teach Filipinos on how to \\"Save, Invest, and Manage\\" their money. Background The show started programming on July 30, 2012 which introduced saving and investment concepts, debunk money myths and give simple tips on how to get more bang for your buck. It also feature finance experts, professional money managers and life coaches who will dispense advice and answer questions from viewers. Hosted by entrepreneur and marketing expert Edric Mendoza, financial planner and former business reporter and columnist Salve Duplito and broadcast journalist Melissa Gecolea. Mendoza, the show's main anchor, is passionate about teaching people the responsibility of spending on the right things and busting bad shopping habits. \\"I‚Äôm thrilled about this show because of what it can do for its viewers. If Filipinos manage their money properly, we will have better fathers, better mothers, and even better children,\\" Mendoza said. The key to financial well-being, Mendoza said, is to junk the \\"entitlement mentality\\" - which makes people believe they deserve to get things they cannot afford. He admitted he once fell victim to that mindset, which nearly made him bankrupt. \\"We are in a culture and environment where wherever we go, everything says ‚Äòbuy me.‚Äô We need to have a mindset change because a large part of why people have money problems is their idea of entitlement that makes them think they owe it to themselves to buy things,\\" he said. Duplito, a multi-awarded business journalist, will teach basics of finance and guide viewers out of their financial problems on her segment \\"Salve Says.\\" \\"There is a great need for financial literacy in this country, but people don‚Äôt want to hear these lessons from someone who is going to peddle a product or a technical guy who says ‚Äòone fourth of one percent.‚Äô My job is to translate these concepts into real doable actions, and tell the story of those who have blundered and those who have succeeded, so that ordinary people will know what to do with their finances,\\" she said. Duplito wants to teach Filipinos where to put their money, to live below their means, and to spot and avoid scams. \\"We need a culture of revolution that will make people who are thrifty, cool,\\" she said. Gecolea, a former TV reporter and news anchor, facilitates the show‚Äôs social media segment by monitoring questions and comments from viewers via Facebook and Twitter and relay them to the program‚Äôs resource persons. \\"The Philippines needs this show. We live in a culture that does not know how to save and we need to be taught. Our stock market is doing great, we have the strongest performing currency in Asia right now.

Later, fellow passenger Albert Stewart convinced the Bishops of the danger, and they returned to the boat deck, leaving Freu Freu behind. Although there was no sense of urgency at that point, they both were told to board lifeboat #7. In a newspaper interview, Helen Bishop stated that when they went on deck, someone said the newly married couples should be put into the lifeboat first and that there were three newlywed couples in their boat. However, this was not mentioned during her later testimony at the US Inquiry into the disaster. Boat 7 was the first to be lowered from the Titanic, being launched at about 12:45 am on the early morning of the 15th, and was rescued by the sometime after 4:10 am. The Bishops, along with other survivors, were transported to New York City aboard the Carpathia. ;Inquiry Once in New York, the couple was ordered to report to the Senate Board of Inquiry in Washington D.C. Helen Bishop testified first, stating that she was conversing with Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor prior to the ship's sinking, when Captain Smith came to speak to Mr. Astor. Astor told the group he was talking with to put on life belts and go on deck. Once on deck, an officer took Mrs. Bishop by the arm and told her to quietly get into the lifeboat; after that, her husband was pushed into the boat with her. Helen Bishop said there were 12 women, 13 men and three crew members in the lifeboat; she continued by saying many of the men in the boat were not married. Dickinson Bishop's testimony mainly dealt with the inability to lock the ship's watertight compartments. He recalled the sailors trying to turn the locks and not being able to close them properly on either side of the ship. Bishop also said that he heard no orders to keep the men out of the lifeboats in favor of women and children. Bishop was later rumored to have dressed as a woman to get his spot in the lifeboat; this rumor, in part, led to the divorce of the couple. On 8 December 1912, Helen gave birth to a boy, Randall Walton Bishop, who died two days afterward. Later life In November 1914, the couple suffered a serious car accident in which Helen was badly injured, and where Dickinson suffered only minor injuries. Helen Bishop's head injuries were so severe, they were reported as being fatal by The New York Times. In an attempt to save Helen's life, her doctors tried what was then a new technique: a metal plate was affixed to her skull to cover the badly injured area. In January 1916, Dickinson and Helen divorced. Charging her husband with cruelty and drunkenness, Helen Bishop was granted a divorce and $100,000 in alimony. She died two months later, on March 16, 1916, after falling at a friend's home on a visit to Danville, Illinois. Dickinson married his third wife, Sydney Boyce, a daughter of William D. Boyce, two days before the death of his second wife, Helen. The announcements of Dickinson's remarriage and Helen's death were both front page stories of the Dowagiac Daily News on the same day. He served in the Army during the First World War. Bishop remained married to Sydney Boyce until her death in November 1950. After the end of the war, he moved away from Dowagiac and settled in Ottawa, Illinois where he died from a stroke on February 16, 1961.

In January 862, a band of Vikings under the son of Weland left their encampment at the abbey of Foss√©s and \\"with a few ships\\" looted the city of Meaux up the river. Shortly after the attack, Hildegar composed the Vita et miracula sancti Faronis episcopi Meldensis, a biography of Saint Faro, his seventh-century predecessor, whose intervention Hildegar credited with saving the church of Meaux from destruction. Hildegar blamed the Viking attacks on the king, Charles, and on \\"treachery\\" (infidelitas), a veiled accusation that Charles had allowed the Vikings to attack because his son, Louis the Stammerer, was in rebellion and staying at Meaux at the time. He was probably supported by Hildegar. In the settlement between father and son, Louis was granted the county of Meaux. Hildegar also called the Seine valley the \\"paradise of the realm\\". Hildegar also records that the Franks were still singing the Farolied, a rustic song about the victory of King Chlothar II over Duke Berthoald of Saxony in 622. Bruno Krusch was of the opinion that Hildegar himself was the author of the Farolied.

The device used two operating systems interchangeably: Windows 8.1 by Microsoft, and Android 4.1 by Google. The device featured a tablet screen and a detachable keyboard. The device was reported to be cancelled due to opposition from both Google and Microsoft in mid-March, 2014.  Design  The tablet portion of the Transformer Book Duet is thick with a 13.3 inch touch screen available in 1366√ó768 or 1920√ó1080 resolution. The back of the screen is a rubberized black plastic, with the volume and power buttons embedded at the top right of the lid. It has a detachable black chiclet keyboard with a key to switch between Windows and Android. The interchangeability of Android and Windows, coupled with the ability to switch between tablet and ultrabook form-factors have led some news sources to call the Transformer Book Duet a \\"four-in-one device\\". Switching between the two operating systems takes about four seconds, according to Asus Chairman Jonney Shih. The computer has an Intel Core i7 processor, and 4GB of RAM. The tablet itself has a 128GB solid state drive, and the keyboard adds 1TB of hard drive storage. The computer also features various ports including HDMI, LAN, one USB 3.0, and two USB 2.0. Daniel Griffiths of Forbes noted that this is not the first time Asus has experimented with \\"hybrid\\" devices. Asus has also developed the Eee PC, a laptop with a 7-inch display; and more recently, the PadFone, a smartphone marketed with companion tablet dock and keyboard dock accessories intended to improve functionality and battery life.  Reception  Since its announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 6, 2014, the Transformer Book Duet has received a high degree of media attention from technology magazines and other mainstream news sources. Vlad Savov of The Verge said that the Transformer Book Duet would work better as either a 10 or 11 inch device, rather than a 13-inch device, because Android \\"already struggles to fully capitalize on the real estate on screens of that size.\\" Joel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine said that the Transformer Book Duet is helpful for any consumer or business-person who needs to use both operating systems. = Industry objection = In March 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that because Microsoft and Google had both implemented policies which effectively ban the certification of devices which dual-boot both Android and Windows, the Transformer Book Duet would be cancelled, and Asus would pull its similar all-in-one desktops from the market. Both companies had reportedly objected to the concept of dual-OS devices of this nature as early as January 2014. Prior to CES, an analyst believed that Microsoft was discouraging manufacturers from releasing such devices because they would dilute Windows 8 and Windows Phone's software ecosystem (which Microsoft was reportedly planning to unify). He also speculated that Microsoft would penalize OEMs by forfeiting discounts on Windows licenses and refusing to provide them with financing for marketing. Additionally, even though Android is an open source operating system that is freely available, Google's application suite is proprietary, and can only be licensed for devices which are approved by the company. This would prevent such devices from including access to Google Play, Android's primary application store.

On October 12, 1926, Chile made the first corner-kick goal in Copa Am√©rica history in a match against Bolivia. 1930 World Cup The Chilean national team during the 1930 FIFA World Cup. At the first ever FIFA World Cup held in Uruguay in 1930, Chile was among the thirteen nations invited to participate in the tournament. The manager of Chile was the young Hungarian Gy√∂rgy Orth. Chile was part of Group 1, with Argentina, Mexico, and France. Chile won their first two games, defeating Mexico 3‚Äì0 on 16 July, then France 1‚Äì0 on 19 July. Sharing the same number of points, Chile and Argentina played a decisive game, on 22 July at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, which ended 3‚Äì1 in Argentina's favor, and thus Chile failed to qualify for the second round. 1950 World Cup The 1950 edition of the FIFA World Cup was held in Brazil. The Chilean manager at the tournament was Alberto Bucciardi, while the team captain was goal keeper Sergio Livingstone. \\"La Roja\\" were in group 2 and Chile lost their first two games against Spain and England, both with a score of 2‚Äì0. The last match was played against the United States, which Chile won by a score of 5‚Äì2, but it was not enough for Chile to advance to the next round. 1962 World Cup Joint top scorer of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, Leonel Sanchez holds the record for appearances with the Chilean national team The 1962 World Cup in Chile was the third World Cup hosted on South American soil.

The second match against Italy, which they won 2‚Äì0, became known as the Battle of Santiago. Although only two players were sent off by the English referee Ken Aston, the match saw repeated, deliberate attempts from players on both sides to harm opponents, and the teams needed police protection to leave the field in safety. Chile defeated European champions USSR, to earn a semi-final against defending World Champions Brazil, but a capacity crowd of 76,600 watched Brazil beat the hosts 4‚Äì2. Chile eventually went on to take third place in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Yugoslavia in the playoff. The team is said to have eaten Swiss cheese before beating Switzerland, spaghetti before beating Italy, and drank vodka before beating the USSR. They also drank coffee before the match against Brazil, although they did not win that match. This was Chile's best performance in a World Cup. 1966 World Cup England was the stage for the eighth World Cup. It was also the first European World Cup that Chile took part in. Qualification for the 1966 edition ended with a play-off between Ecuador in Lima, Peru on 12 October 1965. Chilean manager, Francisco Hormazabal, resigned shortly before the event and was replaced by Luis Alamos. The match against Ecuador finished 2‚Äì1 in Chile's favor, with goals scored by Leonel Sanchez and Ruben Marcos, and the result secured Chile's World Cup berth. Chile was unable to repeat the same success found in the previous World Cup of 1962. Facing the Soviet Union, Italy, and North Korea, Chile was only able to gain 1 point, with a 1‚Äì1 draw against North Korea. Chile scored two goals in the 1966 World Cup, both coming from Ruben Marcos. 1974 World Cup Chile qualified for the 1974 World Cup after a controversial play-off with the USSR. Following a drawn first leg in Moscow, the Soviets refused to play the second leg at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, which had been used as a concentration camp by the military dictatorship of Pinochet. However, FIFA refused to switch the match to a neutral venue, so the Chilean players kicked off on an otherwise empty pitch, and scored into the unguarded USSR net, and because there was no opposition to restart the game, the referee awarded the match to Chile, ensuring they qualified for the 1974 finals. At the tournament itself, Chile lost their opening game 1‚Äì0 to West Germany in Berlin, thanks to a long-range shot from Paul Breitner. Striker Carlos Caszely was sent off in the second half, thus becoming the first player awarded a red card in the tournament's history since the cards went into use. Guided by coach Luis Alamos, Chile then fought out a 1‚Äì1 draw with East Germany, again in Berlin. Martin Hoffmann put East Germany ahead, but Sergio Ahumada equalised with 20 minutes left. Finally, they played out a goalless draw against Australia, which eliminated both teams. 1982 World Cup At the 1982 World Cup, the Chileans performed poorly with an aging team in which Carlos Caszely and the 35-year-old central defender Elias Figueroa were still the main men. Guided by coach Luis Santiba√±ez, they lost their first game 1‚Äì0 to Austria in Oviedo, Walter Schachner scoring the only goal midway through the first half.

She was born at St James's Palace as the daughter of a diplomat and a maid of honour to Caroline of Ansbach. In 1754, she married John Spencer, one of the wealthiest men of the era. A love match, the marriage resulted in the births of three surviving children, who included Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. The Spencers became earl and countess in 1765, a reward granted by the Duke of Newcastle for John's political loyalty to the Whig party. Lady Spencer was a noted philanthropist, and was in communication with a large network of charitable organisations. Her correspondence with a friend represents the largest private collection of letters in the British Library. Lord and Lady Spencer were generous patrons, and frequently hosted plays and concerts at their London estate, Spencer House, which they built in 1764. Early life Margaret Georgiana Poyntz, known as Georgiana to her family, was born on 8 May 1737 at St James's Palace, the fourth surviving child of Stephen Poyntz and Anna Maria Mordaunt. Her diplomat father, the son of a successful linen draper, had been sent to Eton College as a boy to begin a career in society, and eventually became the steward to the young Duke of Cumberland's household and a Privy Councillor to King George II. Georgiana's mother, a maid of honour to Queen Caroline, was the daughter of Brigadier-General the Hon. Lewis Mordaunt and a granddaughter of John Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough. Georgiana had four siblings, three brothers and one sister. Stephen Poyntz died when Georgiana was thirteen, leaving the family, never rich, in comfortable surroundings. Marriage In 1754, seventeen-year-old Georgiana Poyntz met twenty-year-old John Spencer, who had inherited enormous wealth from his great-grandmother, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. She considered him \\"handsomer than an angel,\\" and they felt an instant attraction for each other. She wrote to a friend, \\"I will own it, and never deny it that I do love Spencer above all men on Earth.\\" Spencer was uncertain if he would have his family's approval for the match and opted to spend several months travelling until his twenty-first birthday, when their approval would no longer be necessary. On his return they recognised their love had persisted, and shortly after his birthday they married in a secret ceremony on 20 December 1755 at Althorp, the Spencer family seat in Northamptonshire. The ceremony, held in an upper bedroom, occurred during a ball held in Spencer's honour with five hundred guests in attendance. The Earl Spencer by Thomas Gainsborough The marriage was made public five days later, and the couple was presented at court during the following year. Their early years together were happy, and their eldest child, Georgiana, was born in 1757 at Althorp. Georgiana preferred her firstborn, \\"Dear little Gee\\", to her younger children, George (born 1758) and Henrietta (born 1761). The Spencers owned many lavish estates, but preferred to reside at Althorp. In 1764, the family moved to their newly built London residence, Spencer House. Intended to be worthy of Spencer's large collection of antiquities, the lavish residence took seven years and ¬£50,000 to build. A Whig, in 1756 John entered the House of Commons as MP for Warwick, and in 1761 was awarded a viscountcy by the leader of the party, the Duke of Newcastle. Newcastle's party fell into opposition in 1762, and Spencer's loyalty was rewarded with an earldom on the duke's return to power in 1765. The Spencers were generous patrons of writers and artists, and often hosted plays and concerts at Spencer House. According to biographer Donna T. Andrew, Lady Spencer was \\"exceptionally intelligent and well educated\\"; she was fluent in French and Italian, possessed some knowledge of Greek, and was \\"accomplished in botany.\\" Her correspondence with the Hon. Mrs Howe \\"is reputed to be the largest single private collection of letters in the British Library.\\" Lady Spencer was known as a philanthropist among her contemporaries, and was a founding member of the Ladies Society, \\"one of the first philanthropic organisations systematically to investigate the characters and circumstances of those who appealed to them for assistance.\\" She communicated with philanthropists such as Jonas Hanway and charitable organisations, often advising them on how best to use the resources given to them. Widowhood and death Lady Spencer's three surviving children, Georgiana, George, and Henrietta A lifelong sufferer of ill-health, Lord Spencer died on 31 October 1783 in Bath at the age of 48. An extravagant man, he left their son with enormous debts, but, according to Richard Milward, also \\"greatly increased his family estates and its prestige by being the employer of leading architects, the collector of Italian paintings.\\" Lady Spencer had liked to gamble but gave up the habit during her widowhood; she cautioned her daughters of the dangers of incurring large debts, although her warnings largely went unheeded. In 1785, Henrietta gave birth to a daughter, Caroline. Lady Spencer stayed with them for ten days to help care for the child, finding that Caroline only slept when sleeping with her grandmother. Lady Spencer departed when she was satisfied that mother and daughter were \\"vastly well,\\" although she often returned to visit the family. She took an active role in Caroline's upbringing. Lady Spencer died on 18 March 1814 at St. Albans, and was buried twelve days later at Brington, Northamptonshire.

Inspired by Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, the sixteen-chapter book centres on two families in 1920s Batam that are unknowingly tied together by siblings who were separated in 1883. The brother becomes a political figure, while the sister marries a Baduy priest-king. Ultimately these families are reunited by the wedding of their children, after which the priest sacrifices himself to calm a stirring Krakatoa. First published as a serial in Kwee's magazine Panorama between 7 April and 22 December 1928, Drama dari Krakatau was written over a period of two months after the author was asked to prepare a \\"sensational\\" story for a film. Before the final instalment had been published, the novel had already been adapted for the stage. Although Kwee was known as a realist and researched the volcano before writing, Drama dari Krakatau is replete with mysticism. Thematic analyses have focused on the depiction of indigenous cultures by Kwee (himself ethnic Chinese), as well as geography and nationalism. As with other works of Chinese Malay literature, the book is not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon. Plot In 1883, Krakatoa begins stirring for the first time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a bad dream about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out of the carriage she is in; Hasan, however, arrives safely in Rangkas Gombong. Forty-four years pass. Moelia, the son of the Regent of Rangkas Gombong and Assistant Wedana of Sindanglaut, hears of a Baduy priest, Noesa Brama, who is curing the sick and injured. Moelia travels to Mount Ciwalirang to interview him, and finds Noesa Brama an intelligent and well-spoken man. Over lunch Moelia falls in love with the priest's daughter, Retna Sari. He learns that she must marry a man of equal standing to her father, one who is \\"no less than the Sultan of Yogyakarta or the Sunan of Solo\\". Upon returning home, Moelia realises that Noesa Brama must be the last male descendant of the Hindu kings of Pajajaran, and that both Retna Sari and her mother bear a striking resemblance to his own grandmother. Several days later, he returned to the mountain and overhears a group of men from Palembang planning to kidnap Retna Sari. He chases them away, then briefly visits Noesa Brama before returning home. Though he attempts to forget Retna Sari, he is unable to do so. The following week, the men from Palembang lie to the police, leading to Noesa Brama's arrest for planning a rebellion; the men then persuade Retna Sari and her mother to follow them to Sumatra. Learning of this, Moelia arranges for Noesa Brama's release. The priest returns home to find that his wife and daughter have gone ‚Äì seemingly willingly ‚Äì with the men from Palembang, while Moelia takes a steamboat and chases the kidnappers. Before he can stop them, Krakatoa erupts again, overturning the fleeing ship. Moelia barely has enough time to rescue the women before the mountain erupts a second time, killing the fugitives. Moelia informs his father, revealed to be Hasan, of the eruptions, and the older man comes to his son's home. There he meets Retna Sari and her mother. They discover that Retna Sari's mother is Soerijati, explaining the familial resemblance. She reveals that she had been found and raised by Noesa Brama's father; she also tells of a statue of Vishnu in a cave atop Mount Ciwalirang with the inscription \\"At the time when I am damaged, the land and all your descendants will be destroyed, cursed by Rakata's anger\\", damage to which the priests believe caused the Krakatoa eruption. Unknown to them, Noesa Brama ‚Äì enraged at the thought of his daughter marrying a commoner ‚Äì has deliberately destroyed this statue by throwing it down a well, causing the eruption which stopped the fugitives. Moelia and his family depart for Ciwalirang the following morning, hoping that Noesa Brama will consent to the marriage of Moelia and Retna Sari. The priest accepts the proposal, but expresses regret over the destruction of the statue after he discovers that Retna Sari and Soerijati had not gone willingly with the men from Palembang. He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, hoping that his spirit and those of his ancestors can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active. Writing Kwee was inspired by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Drama dari Krakatau was written by the journalist Kwee Tek Hoay. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his native wife, Kwee had been raised in the Chinese culture and educated at schools that focuses on preparing students for life in a modern world, as opposed to promoting tradition for its own sake. By the time he wrote the novel, Kwee was an active proponent of Buddhist teachings. He also wrote extensively on themes relating to the archipelago's indigenous population, and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay and drew on these influences after becoming a writer. His first novel, Djadi Korbannja \\"Perempoean Hina\\" (The Victim of a \\"Contemptible Woman\\"), was published in 1924. In 1928 Kwee was asked by a friend, who was hoping to establish a film company, to write a \\"sensational\\" story which could be used as the basis for a movie. Ongoing activity at Krakatoa was foremost in the author's mind and, after reading Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii, Kwee asked himself \\"is it impossible for one to write a drama about Krakatoa?\\" Owing to the length of time between the 1883 and 1928 eruptions, Kwee decided to begin his story with the separation of two young siblings. Further elements of the story were inspired by the mountain-dwelling Baduy, a group which tended to avoid outsiders and claimed to be descended from the Hindu kings of Pajajaran. Kwee thought himself a realist, considering it \\"better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth.\\" He was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied more on their fantasies than logic and truth. Hoping to keep his story grounded in reality, Kwee researched the history of the Baduy, the geological formation of Krakatoa, and the events of 1883 and 1928; in total he consulted 15 books, all in English or Dutch. Writing began on 19 March 1928 and was completed on 28 May of that year. Drama dari Krakatau consists of sixteen chapters, which were spread over 125 pages in the first printing. Themes Although Kwee was a staunch supporter of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes a degree of mysticism, as evidenced by the apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayy√°m, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel. Kwee's work is the earliest of three Chinese Malay novels which were inspired by volcanic eruptions. The second, Liem Khing Hoo's Meledaknja Goenoeng Keloet (The Eruption of Mount Kelud), was inspired by Kelud in East Java and was published in the monthly magazine Tjerita Roman in 1929. The third, Kwee's Drama dari Merapie (Drama of Merapi), was inspired by Central Java's Mount Merapi and was published as a serial in Moestika Romans from March to September 1931.; . Volcanic eruptions also featured in contemporary Chinese Malay poetry. Claudine Salmon records one syair, Ong Tjong Sian's Sair Petjanja Goenoeng Krakatau (Syair on the Eruption of Mount Krakatoa; 1929), as dealing with the community's fears after Krakatoa resumed activity. Unlike many contemporary works by ethnic Chinese authors, Drama dari Krakatau features no Chinese characters in major roles; the only such characters are mentioned in passing, shopowners who provide emergency food supplies to the regent. Historically, Malay-language works by ethnic Chinese authors centred on Chinese characters, to the point that terms such as tanah-air (homeland) were often understood to mean mainland China, rather than the Malay Archipelago or Dutch East Indies. Chinese Malay works which featured exclusively indigenous characters had only developed in the 1920s. Uncommonly for ethnic Chinese writers of this period, Kwee attempts to centre the novel around indigenous people and present it from their perspective, \\"impersonating\\" these indigenous cultures through his narrative. As with many stories with predominantly indigenous casts, Drama dari Krakatau is set in a rural area, far from the cities where the ethnic Chinese populace were concentrated. Geography plays a major role. The novel starts on a macro scale, depicting the origins of the archipelago from rising sea levels caused by the sinking of Poseidonis, then progresses increasingly towards the micro scale, passing through views of Java, Sumatra, and Krakatoa, before focusing on the home of Tjakra Amidjaja and the beginning of the plot. A later passage details the view from Mount Ciwalirang, showing Java, Krakatoa and Sumatra. The Indonesian literary scholar Melani Budianta argues that this \\"geographic panorama\\", combined with the sympathetic depiction of other cultures and religions, shows elements of nationalism in the novel; such a theme has also been found in Kwee's Drama dari Boeven Digoel (Drama of Boeven Digoel; 1938). She writes that the panoramic views of the archipelago \\"help the readers to imagine the geography of a nation yet to be united\\", whereas the \\"impersonation\\" presents a \\"region of theosophy where religious difference is unified in the belief of goodness.\\" Publication history and reception Drama dari Krakatau was first published in serial form in Kwee's magazine Panorama, between 7 April and 22 December 1928. This serial was then published as a novel by Hoa Siang In Kiok in 1929. A new printing, adopting the 1972 spelling reform, was included in the second volume of Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia, an anthology of Chinese Malay literature. This volume also included Kwee's novella Roema Sekola jang Saja Impiken (The Schoolhouse of My Dreams; 1925) and the novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang; 1927). As with Kwee's earlier work Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang, an adaptation of Drama dari Krakatau was performed on stage before its completion. On 28 March 1928, the Moon Opera performed Drama dari Krakatau at Pasar Senen in Weltevreden, Batavia (now Senen, Jakarta). The troupe performed the story again on 31 March and 5 April, the latter at Mangga Besar, Batavia. Kwee prepared the story for the performances, abbreviating and simplifying it for the stage. One of the main difficulties, he wrote, was presenting Krakatoa on stage: it was a technical challenge, yet could not be abandoned as \\"performing this play without showing the eruption of Krakatoa would be like performing Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.\\" As with all works written in vernacular Malay, the novel has not been considered part of the Indonesian literary canon. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez posits a socio-political cause for this. The Dutch colonial government used Court Malay as a \\"language of administration\\", a language for everyday dealings, while the Indonesian nationalists appropriated the language to help build a national culture. Chinese Malay literature, written in \\"low\\" Malay, was steadily marginalised. Sumardjo, however, sees a question of classification: though vernacular Malay was the lingua franca of the time, it was not Indonesian, and as such, he asks whether works in vernacular Malay should be classified as local literature, Indonesian literature, or simply Chinese Malay literature.

He inherited a large collection of art from his family and was himself an avid collector. A drawing that he purchased in 1936 was sold by his estate for $12 million in 2000. Ford was the director of the Burlington Magazine, president of Walpole Society and chaired the National Art Collections Fund. During World War II he was a Troop Sergeant-Major in the Royal Artillery and then served in the military intelligence organisation, MI9. Personal life Richard Brinsley Ford was born in 1908 in Petworth, Sussex to Captain Richard Ford (1860‚Äì1940) and Rosamund Isabel Ramsden (1872‚Äì1911). His father was an officer for the British Army, who inherited in 1917 a large art collection that had been assembled by his great great grandfather, Richard Ford (1758‚Äì1806) and his maternal great-grandfather, Benjamin Booth. Gustav Waagen describes the collection in Treasures of Art in Great Britain. Richard Ford, his great grandfather, wrote travel books on Spain. The Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan was an ancestor. Ford attended Eton College. He then studied modern history at Trinity College, Oxford and graduated in 1930. In 1937 Ford married a distant cousin, Joan Mary Vyvyan who was born in 1910. The couple had one daughter and two sons. He died of a heart attack at his home in London on 4 May 1999. Early art collection Johann Heinrich F√ºssli, Lady at dressing table, Brinsley Ford collection In 1927 Ford joined the National Art Collections Fund. His maternal grandmother left him a legacy two years later with which Ford was able to begin collecting art, including the works of Fuseli, Michelangelo, Ingres, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Henry Moore. He met art connoisseur James Byam Shaw and artist Charles Barrow Prescott when he joined the Burlington Fine Arts Club. In 1939 he published a scholarly article in the Burlington Magazine of portrait drawings made by Ingres. His father died in 1940 and the following year he took possession of his father's art collection. World War II In 1939, before World War II began, Ford became Troop Sergeant-Major in the Royal Artillery of the British Army. He was transferred to MI9 military intelligence in 1941 and later headed the Brussels office. Career Ford amassed an art collection that was held at his house at Wyndham Place. He added works by Batoni, Cozza, Cavallino, creating a collection of Italian seicento and settecento works. In 1951 he published The Drawings of Richard Wilson. During the war years the Burlington Magazine floundered but Ford rallied support and provided financial supported to the journal. In its tribute to him following his death, the magazine wrote that he was \\"the principal engineers of this Magazine's survival in the lean years that followed World War II.\\" In 1952 became its director. In 1954 he became a trustee of the National Gallery. He became a member of the National Art Collections Fund executive committee in 1974 and its chair in 1975. Under his leadership more than 200 works of art were saved and National Trust properties received art work. He organised an exhibition, \\"Richard Ford in Spain\\", lent works and assisted Denys Sutton in the development of the exhibition catalog. He was chairman until 1980. In 1984, Ford was knighted for his work. Two years later he became the Walpole Society president, having stepped down from the Burlington Magazine. The society published a catalog of his collection in 1998.  Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701-1800  Interested in men who had made the grand tour to Italy, Ford began accumulating information for a dictionary in the 1950s. A Dictionary of British and Irish Travellers in Italy, 1701‚Äì1800, written by John Ingamells was published in 1997.  Archive & library  Ford's archive on British and Irish travellers to Italy, from which the Dictionary was written, is in the Paul Mellon Centre's archive for public consultation. The archive includes research notes, correspondence, transcriptions and copies of original sources, photocopies of published material, publications and photographs. The main sequence of material is reference material in an alphabetical run of British and Irish travellers that includes artists, antiquaries, collectors and the nobility. Ford's archive also comprises material on foreign travellers and general subjects covering the arts, taste and patronage and Ford's unpublished typescript Aspects of the Grand Tour. In 2008, the family of the late Sir Brinsley Ford donated approximately 250 exhibition catalogues on 20th-century artists and on the subject of the Grand Tour to the Paul Mellon Centre library. Ford art collection Benjamin Booth, Brinsley's ancestor, began collecting works of art in the 18th century, most notably the bulk of Richard Wilson's English landscapes. It was further enhanced when Marianne, his daughter, was married to Richard Ford. Brinsley Ford added paintings, sculptures and ceramics to the collection. Works were made during the Baroque and Renaissance periods, including works of Old Masters. He has works of students of the Royal Academy of Arts that line the walls of his bedroom, from floor to ceiling. Ford enjoyed the tours he gave of the collection at his Wyndham Place house. He provided background stories about his collection, given with \\"the measured cadences of Edward Gibbon with the humorous sparkle of Horace Walpole\\" as he took visitors through rooms that held collection items. The Brinsley Ford estate sold a drawing of what became Michelangelo's Cristo della Minerva statue, through Christie's, to a German art dealer for $12,378,500. The drawing, purchased by Ford in 1936, was used as inspiration for the statue located at the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome that was commissioned in 1514. It was sold for nearly $5 million more than the previous price paid for a Michelangelo work, the Woman of Camaria in 1998. In 1936, Ford was criticised for spending about 3,000 guineas for a drawing of Michelangelo's; his aunt felt it was extravagant since he paid about what it would cost for a home at that time. That story was often one of the tidbits that Ford shared on his tours with visitors. The Walpole Society's 60th- anniversary edition was dedicated to the Ford Art Collection. ;Exhibitions A few of the exhibitions of the collection are: *after 1951 ‚Äì Drawings of Richard Wilson, loaned worldwide for exhibitions *1974 ‚Äì \\"Richard Ford in Spain\\", shown in London and Birmingham *2011 ‚Äì The Granary Art Gallery, Weston Park *long term loan - 'At Home with Art ‚Äì Treasures from the Brinsley Ford Collection', Basildon Park Published works ;Author   * * ;Co- author    * References External links  * Dictionary of Art Historians entry for Sir Richard Brinsley Ford * The Brinsley Ford Archive at the Paul Mellon Centre * Obituary, The Independent May 1999 Further reading   Category:1908 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Royal Artillery personnel Category:British art historians Category:British art collectors Category:20th-century British historians ","title":"Brinsley Ford"},{"id":"41571700","text":"Joshua Lenz (born September 22, 1990) is a former American football wide receiver.

Sto≈æice developed from a core settlement of farms east of the road on a terrace above the Sava River. The soil is sandy and fertile. Name The name Sto≈æice is derived from the Slovene common noun stog 'stack of hay', referring to local agricultural practices. In the past the German name of the village was Stoschze. History The walls of a square Roman structure were discovered in the north part of the Sto≈æice cemetery in 1880. Associated finds included a coin from the 4th century. Roman tiles and graves have also been found at the Urbanƒçek farm in Sto≈æice. Before the Second World War, a textile factory and a vinegar and yeast factory operated in the village. Important economic activities also included sales of foodstuffs, especially milk and eggs, to Ljubljana.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 349. After the war, there was extensive private construction in the Sto≈æice. The southern part of Sto≈æice (79 houses with a population of 628) was annexed by Ljubljana in 1935. The remainder of Sto≈æice was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1974, ending its existence as an independent settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database.

It is a modified version of the RD-56, developed for a never-completed cryogenic upper stage of the N-1 super-heavy lift rocket, with the goal of enabling crewed lunar missions by the USSR. The KVD-1 produces a thrust of 7.5 tonnes. Initial Development KVD-1 was originated from the RD-56 engine which were intended to be used for USSR Moon programmes. RD-56 aka 11D56 engines were developed for N1M rocket programme, the planned derivative of N1, but later they were abandoned due to four successive launch failures of N1. Later the design of the engine was sold to ISRO under the name \\"KVD-1\\" under a deal worth $120 million with soviet agency Glavkosmos which enabled ISRO to import 2 KVD-1 engines and an agreement for transfer of technology from Russia. ISRO Programme The engines were proven to be inefficient because of their low thrust-to-weight ratio. Later the Russian space agency optimised the engine to launch payloads with a mass of 2.5 tonnes or less. The INSAT-4CR satellite with a mass of 2,140 kg was launched in 2007 but reached a lower than planned orbit due to the poor performance of the third stage's single KVD-1 engine. The satellite subsequently used its own propulsion to get to the planned orbit. Because of this the useful life of the satellite was shortened. Sanctions imposed by United States In 1991, an agreement was signed between India and Russia for technology transfer to India so that KVD-1 engines can be built indigenously in India. But later in July 1993, US imposed sanctions on ISRO and Glavkosmos saying it voids the Missile Technology Control Regime. After suffering setback in this case ISRO was forced to develop its own cryogenic programme.

The Quilon‚ÄìShencottah railway line was the first railway line in the erstwhile Travancore state and is more than a century old. The Kollam‚ÄìSengottai section is part of the Kollam‚ÄìChennai metre gauge rail route commissioned by the British in 1904. The line has been completely converted to broad gauge and is now fully operational from to Shengottai. History The Kollam-Sengottai metre gauge line was conceived and implemented by Maharajah Uthram Thirunal of Travancore. It was built jointly by South Indian Railway Company, Travancore State and the Madras Presidency. After a survey in 1888, work started in 1900 and was completed by 1902. The first goods train travelled on this route in 1902 while the first passenger train began its run in 1904. Metre gauge services were inaugurated on 1July 1904 with the first passenger train flagged off from Kollam by Maharajah Moolam Thirunal of Travancore with a 21-gun salute. The railway line was constructed by the British in the foothills of the Western Ghats to transport forest products, spices and cashews from Kollam to Chennai, their southern headquarters. = Timeline = * 1899 - Survey for Quilon-Madras rail link completed * 1900 - Works for Kollam‚ÄìSengottai Metre gauge railway line started to connect the City of Quilon with Madras * 1902 - Kollam‚ÄìSengottai Railway line works completed * 1904 - On 1 June, His Highness Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma of Travancore flagged off the first passenger train service on the Kollam‚ÄìSengottai railway line at Kollam railway station * 1998 - Gauge conversion of Kollam‚ÄìSengottai Railway line officially started * 2007 - On 1 May, rail services on Kollam-Punalur section withdrawn * 2010 - On 10 May, Kollam-Punalur broad gauge section thrown open for services * 2018 - On 31 March, the entire Kollam‚ÄìSengottai line thrown open for passenger train services. The first passenger train on the stretch was Tambaram-Kollam- Tambaram special train service(06027/28) which completed the service by earning Rs 3.15 lakh as passenger ticket collection from its 879 passengers against a capacity of 712. About the route The route was once a lifeline for the people of the southern districts of Kerala state and the Sengottai- Virudhunagar belt of Tamil Nadu. It served to create a strong link especially among the trading community of these areas in the two States. British tea estates and coffee plantations thrived on the labour of tribesman living in the Thenmala forests and workers from Tamil Nadu. The railway line contributed much to the development of a plantation economy in this area. The farmers of the Shencottah-Virudhunagar belt depended on the trains to market their produce in south Travancore. Huge quantities of vegetables, groceries and dairy products such as curd were brought into Kollam district from Tamil Nadu by trains that plied the route. The Palaruvi and Kazhuthurutti waterfalls and the Thenmala eco-tourism centre are on the fringes of this line, and the Courtallam waterfalls at the destination make this route popular with nature lovers. =Notable landmarks on the route= View of 13 Kannara Bridge * 13 Kannara Bridge The 13 Kannara bridge or 13 Arch Bridge (Pathimoonu kannara palam) is a 108‚Äìyear‚Äìold bridge at Kazhathuruthi. The bridge consists of 13 arches and is a major landmark on the Kollam-Sengottai railway line as well as a testimony to the architectural abilities of the British. The bridge connects two hillocks and stands on thirteen granite pillars each almost a hundred feet tall.

The train was later renamed the Quilon-Madras Mail. The train was extended to Trivandrum in 1918 after completion of the Quilon-Trivandrum metre gauge line. This train was one of the early metre gauge trains to have a First Class. The train was truncated at Quilon after the Kollam -Trivandrum Central metre gauge track was converted to broad gauge in 1979. The train went through to Madurai junction railway station via Manamadurai Junction from 1996 when the Virudhunagar- Madurai line was converted to broad gauge. The train was discontinued in June 2000. * Train No:6383/6384 Tirunelveli -Kollam Express * Sengottai-Kollam passenger This passenger train was the main means of transport among office workers and students along this route. Broad gauge conversion The Punalur- Sengottai section is part of the 325-km Kollam- Sengottai-Tenkasi- Tirunelveli- Tiruchendur gauge conversion project and part of the Tenkasi- Virudhunagar trunk route to Chennai. The gauge conversion of the Sengottai- Tiruchendur section has been completed and is open to traffic. =Kollam - Punalur section= The Kollam Junction -Punalur metre gauge railway line to broad gauge conversion works foundation stone was laid in 1998 at Punalur.

It is native to tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Description P. damicornis is a colonial coral and can grow into clumps up to high. It is distinguishable from other members of the genus by the verrucae (wart-like growths) on its surface being more irregularly arranged. It is more branched than the otherwise similar P. verrucosa. Its form varies according to its habitat and is more open and branched in calm positions and more compact on the upper parts of reefs where water movement is greater. Its colour varies and may be greenish, pink, yellowish-brown or pale brown. Distribution and habitat Cauliflower coral is native to the tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its wide range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea to Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Hawaii, Easter Island, and the western coast of Central America. It is found at depths to about , but is most common between , often forming dense patches. It is equally found on reef slopes and in lagoons, among mangroves and on wharves, but not in areas with strong water movement. With such a wide range, it is one of the most abundant of corals. Biology P. damicornis is a reef-building coral, grows fast, and is a strong competitor. The polyps extend their tentacles at night to feed on plankton. When colonies are broken apart, chunks can become lodged on the seabed and grow into new individuals, a form of asexual reproduction by fragmentation. This coral also reproduces by sexual means. It is a simultaneous hermaphrodite, and eggs and sperm are retained inside the coral and batches of planular larvae are released into the sea around the time of the new moon. These have a lipid-rich yolk and great dispersal abilities, as they remain viable for as much as 100 days. Although brooding of larvae occurs over most of its range, in Western Australia P. damicornis both broods planular larvae and releases gametes by broadcast spawning, while in the Eastern Pacific, only broadcast spawning takes place. Cauliflower coral contains microscopic symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) living within its tissues. Through photosynthesis, these algae produce energy-rich molecules the coral can assimilate. The density of the dinoflagellates varies depending on seasonal changes in water temperature, light levels, and dissolved nitrate concentration. It is a dynamic process and in extreme environmental conditions results in the complete expulsion of the algae and the bleaching of the coral. However, compared to other corals, this species is resistant to bleaching. Based on the GeoSymbio Database, Pocillopora damicornis has been known to interact with 30 species (or subclade types) of Symbiodinium, the highest interaction rate of any known coral species along with Stylophora pistillata Franklin EC, Stat M, Pochon X, Putnam HM, Gates RD (2012) GeoSymbio: a hybrid, cloud-based web application of global geospatial bioinformatics and ecoinformatics forSymbiodinium‚Äìhost symbioses.

This coral is collected for the aquarium trade and in some regions, it is mined for conversion into cement. The IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\", as it considers the rate of decline in its populations is not sufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. Like all corals, it is listed on CITES Appendix II.

Early life John Hart was one of five children of William Hart of Eynsham, a recusant. In February 1569 John Hart enrolled at the University of Leuven and the following year went to the English College, Douai. Around 1574, he left Douai for the English College, Rome. His younger brother William also attended the English College in Rome, where he died in 1584. His two sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret, became Bridgettine nuns at the Convent of Sion in Rouen.Feingold, Mordechai. \\"The Reluctant Martyr: John Hart‚Äôs English Mission\\", Journal of Jesuit Studies, Vol. 6: No. 4, 11 October 2019 John Hart took Roman Catholic minor orders in 1575 and the degree of B.D. in the university of Douay in 1578. He was ordained priest on 29 March 1578 in Cambrai. Shortly thereafter, the College at Douai relocated to Rheims, as did Hart. In June 1580 Hart was ordered to the English mission to replace Thomas Goldwell, and Nicholas Morton, both elderly and well-known in England. Hart, Thomas Cottam, and Humphrey Ely set sail from Dunkirk. Unbeknownst to them, the spy Charles Sledd, who had dined with William Allen, had already advised Henry Cobham, English ambassador at Paris, that Allen would soon be sending priests back to England. =Arrest and reprieves= Mistaken for someone else, Hart was arrested as soon as he landed at Dover. Having identified himself, he was sent in custody to Nonsuch Palace and examined by Francis Walsingham. He was paroled on bond for three months, conditioned on his going to Oxford to confer with Protestant theologian John Rainolds. He was subsequently placed in the Marshalsea Prison, and taken to the Tower of London on 24 December 1580. There, after being shown the rack, a frightened Hart was interrogated and gave information concerning a number of Catholics on the Continent, and Allen's theories of best the Queen might be deposed. On 21 November 1581, the day after Edmund Campion's condemnation, Hart was tried with other priests and condemned to death. On 1 December 1581 he was to have been executed with Campion, Ralph Sherwin, and Alexander Briant, but when placed on the hurdle he promised to recant, and he was taken back to prison. Hart then wrote to Walsingham what was an act of apostasy, a document that has survived. He later retracted it. What Hart agreed with Walsingham at this point is that he would inform on William Allen, using a claim to having been racked to add to his credibility. Hart then retracted the offer, was condemned to die on 28 May 1582, and then was reprieved again. It is stated that on 18 March 1582, while in prison, Hart was admitted into the Society of Jesus. =Conference with Rainolds= Walsingham gave Hart leave to go to Oxford for three months on condition that he should confer with John Rainolds on the matters in controversy between the English and Roman churches. The conference appears to have taken place during 1582. William Camden was later complimentary about Hart's learning. The Summe of the Conference betwene John Rainoldes and John Hart, touching the Head and Faith of the Church. Penned by John Rainoldes, according to the notes set down in writing by them both; perused by J. Hart was published at London in 1584, reprinted in 1588, 1598, and 1609, and translated into Latin (Oxford, 1610) by Henry Parry. Charles Dodd argued that the conference was held on unequal terms, as Hart was unprovided with books, and asserted that the details were unfairly given by Rainolds. =Further confinement= Hart returned to Walsingham, and was sent back to the Tower of London. He remained confined for a long period, and was subjected to punishments. The view of Rainolds was that Hart was motivated only by the thought of reprieve. Later life On 21 January 1585 Hart and twenty others, including Jasper Heywood, were sent to France, banished from England by royal commission. They were landed on the coast of Normandy, and were sent to Abbeville after signing a certificate to the effect that they had been well treated on the voyage. Hart then went to Verdun, and on to Rome. His superiors ordered him to Poland, and he died at Jaros≈Çaw, on 17 or 19 July 1586. Journal Hart's journal from the Tower has been attributed incorrectly to Edward Rishton. It formed part of the material for the second edition (1586) of the ' of Nicholas Sander. From the third edition it was not used, and the suggestion is that Robert Persons by then knew that Hart had offered to become an agent of Walsingham.

The first coat of arms of East Timor depicted crossed suriks. Description The surik has a single edge blade. The width of the blade narrows from the base down to the tip. Most of the handle is made from horn, and is decorated with tassels to look tough. Goat's hair or horse's hair is attached to the handle. Carving an eye at the center of the handle is meant to strengthen its supernatural power. The sheath of this sword is made of wood. A surik sword used along with a long curved shield is called surik samara. Cultural For the Belu people of Nusa Tenggara, the surik is considered as a sacred sword. Its supposed supernatural abilities depend on the person who wield the sword; it is believed by the people that no commoner can touch the surik, or the else the sword would turn against that person. Because of that, the community will take counsel to determine who should wield the surik before going to war. The surik is also used in traditional dance in Timor called, Tari Surik Laleok, which is meant to portray the local warrior's customs. suriks were also worn by the Meos, the foremost fighters, and usually also the most successful head-hunters of the village. In cases where a dispute is to be settled between two parties in places like Maubara and Ermera, East Timor are known as nahe no lulun biti (to open and close the mat) or tula mesa leten (to put on the table).

Vishnu's connection to the killings is that he was one of the orphans living with the nun and other children at the orphanage. Mr. Manchanda and Mr. Khan tried to get the nun to sell the orphanage, but when she refused, they had the orphanage burnt down. Vishnu (known as Arjun as a child), managed to escape but due to an injury he lost his memory of what transpired. The horrific smokey apparition is the ghost of the nun who kills all those involved in the crime. The ghosts of the dead children play their part in the killings as they simultaneously warn, befuddle and scare the people within the mall killing not only those involved but also innocent people as well. After the nun kills Mr. Manchanda, she also attempts to kill Ahana, till Vishnu begs the nun to stop as she has already killed the men responsible. The movie ends with the nun sparing Ahana and Vishnu as they are shown walking out of the mall.
